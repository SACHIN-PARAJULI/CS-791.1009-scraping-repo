"Apr 4, 2024",One of the most layered performances of Cruise's career...,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Synopsis: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and the IMF team join forces with CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to prevent a disaster of epic proportions. Arms dealer John Lark and a group of terrorists known as the Apostles plan to use three plutonium cores for a simultaneous nuclear attack on the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca, Saudi Arabia. When the weapons go missing, Ethan and his crew find themselves in a desperate race against time to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. Finally, we reach D-day. I have been reviewing all films from the M:I franchise for the past week, and now it is time for the best and craziest movie yet! If you want, you can check my thoughts on the other films by clicking each ones' title: Mission: Impossible, Mission: Impossible II, Mission: Impossible III, Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. Oh. My. God ... These are the three words that kept coming out of my mouth while watching Fallout. In a world where we barely have any real action anymore since everything is or uses bits of CGI, it is a huge breath of relief to be able to enjoy such jaw-dropping, mind-blowing, outstanding action set pieces! I know I have been writing this a lot throughout these reviews, but this one completely floored me. This is going to be the action movie to beat for a few years ... Maybe until the next Mission: Impossible installment, who knows?! My heart pumped like it never did before. The stuff that Tom Cruise actually does (which is basically everything) is unbelievable. Truly unbelievable, like you will have to get home and search for behind-the-scenes videos to understand how were they able to pull those sequences off. He runs like hell, jumps from building to building (you probably already know about the story of his broken foot), performs a HALO jump (a military parachuting free fall where the parachute is open at low altitude and the drop is performed at 25.000 feet), insanely drives a motorcycle through Paris streets, pilots a helicopter ... You got it, right?! This is the reason why the Mission: Impossible saga needs to continue. If it stops, there is never going to exist another film series that can bring such realism and incredible stunts like M:I does. It is undoubtedly the best action franchise of all-time, at least regarding the action set pieces. There is no possible comparison with any other movies. I am writing this because the ending might bother a few people. I have been having some bad luck with endings this year. There are a lot of films that I have watched and loved almost everything about it, but then its ending disappointed me in some way (Avengers: Infinity War, A Quiet Place, and some more). I hate when directors tease a particular end, which would be a shock and something entirely unexpected, and at the last minute they back off and take the safe route. Christopher McQuarrie does that, but Fallout might be the only movie where I understand why he did it. I do not want to go into spoilers territory so I will justify it this way. If McQuarrie chose the bold ending, Fallout would probably be an A+, but the franchise would have to end as well (if it wanted to continue to be successful). By choosing the safe route, he guarantees the saga's vitality, but the film suffers from the issue in the last paragraph since everyone is going to leave the theater thinking ""oh, I wish they would have gone with THAT ending"". This is a minor issue that I have apart from another one regarding the first act's pacing. This is the longest movie of the saga and McQuarrie already answered why. Not to this question in particular, but he did admit that this film was structured around the action set pieces. Usually, this is a problem because it is often awfully executed. Never create a movie without writing your story and characters first. However, this is the sixth film of the franchise, and pretty much every significant character has been in the previous installments.  Nevertheless, this justifies why the first act delivers so much information which causes the plot to start a bit convoluted. It eventually organizes itself, and it becomes a simple story, filled with predictable twists and turns that ultimately accomplishes its mission: to support the fantastic action sequences. Please, do not expect some Oscar-worthy screenplays from M:I movies because if you leave disappointed due to your unrealistic expectations, that's on you. As always, the cast is sensational and every character that we love and care about come back to one hell of a ride. I already blabbed about Cruise's courage, but there are a lot of exceptional performances. Simon Pegg (Benji) and Ving Rhames (Luther) are a hell of a team, providing some needed comic relief moments in such an action-heavy film. Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust) continues to be incredibly captivating, Michelle Monaghan (Julia) has some screentime to shine, and Alec Baldwin (Alan Hunley) also brings his A-game. Sean Harris (Solomon Lane) returns in style, and Henry Cavill (Walker) proves to be a fantastic addition to the saga, by being the protagonist of some of the most potent hand-to-hand combat in the series. Besides the action, every technical aspect is seamless. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous, there are so many beautiful wide shots, and some of them are a true filmmaking achievement. The score is remarkable as it usually is in the M:I movies and it helps to raise some goosebumps in the vertiginous scenes (people with a fear of heights are gonna have a hard time with this one). The editing is perfect, and the tone and pacing are very well-balanced with the help of Rhames and Pegg's characters, who bring some stops to the extended action sequences (the driving around Paris sequence could have been shorter). There is still that sense of urgency and the frenetic pacing, which provides a significant level of entertainment. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the best film of its franchise and one of the best action movies of all-time, regarding the execution of said action set pieces. Tom Cruise proves that he is an icon if not the biggest icon in action film history, through dozens of runs, jumps and God knows what more. McQuarrie brings his fantastic technical attributes to this movie and uses an exceptional cast to interpret remarkable characters. A simple yet captivating plot supports the excellent action, and it still carries a few (predictable) twists. Only a few nit-picky things forbid me from giving this film an A+, but I promise you, it will definitely be in my Top10 by the end of the year. Go see it! On IMAX! NOW!",POSITIVE
"Jun 22, 2023"," Vague Visages’ Mission: Impossible – Fallout review contains minor spoilers. Christopher McQuarrie’s 2018 movie on Paramount+ features Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill and Ving Rhames. Check out the VV home page for more film reviews, along with cast/character summaries, streaming guides and complete soundtrack song listings. Continuing the narrative of his successful 2015 film Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, writer, director and now co-producer Christopher McQuarrie breaks with IMF tradition and commands the director’s seat a second time with Mission: Impossible — Fallout, aka MI6. When it comes to sheer quantity of triple-crosses, double agents, remote control gizmo toys, one-liners, stunts and rubber mask fake outs, Mission: Impossible — Fallout outdoes its predecessors. The big question now, however, is whether the longevity of this franchise is finally taking its toll on the overall quality. Once again, Impossible Mission Force (IMF) agent Ethan Hunt and his spy fraternity face the impossible task of saving the world from an apocalyptic catastrophe. This narrative thread continues to be the bread and butter of the franchise, dating back to Brad Bird’s Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol (2011). Yet, even with slight alterations to the standard apocalyptic tale, the Fallout “plot” remains largely superficial window dressing, consistent with its predecessors. It is the cast/crew chemistry and stunts that are the true selling points. McQuarrie spices things up a bit by bringing back MI5’s villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He is a radical anarchist, hell-bent on taking revenge on Hunt and the world, striving for maximum suffering to yield epic peace. Lane is a constant reminder to Hunt of his past failures and deepest fears. From MI5 to MI6, Lane’s character shifts from more of a strategist to an anarchist. Harris’ acting in MI6 as a doomsday prophet is excellent — yet not as energizing or entertaining as seen in MI5. His portrayal of anarchy is far more subdued and dull than that of Heath Ledger as the Joker in Christopher Nolan’s The Dark Knight (2008). This time, a new challenge to the IMF is the tight CIA leash around Hunt and his crew, as the top spook, August Walker (Henry Cavill), keeps a careful eye on them, with orders to terminate if they go rogue. Walker presents the main physical threat to Hunt individually, while Lane taunts the IMF top agent psychologically. Both target Hunt’s heart, and neither characterization is sufficiently strong. The best relationship dynamic is between Hunt and MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), another carryover from MI5. She continues to add new energy and a coolness factor to this veteran franchise. More importantly, as a femme fatale archetype, Faust presents a relationship challenge for Hunt, restoring to this franchise its cagey, team conflicts. Yet, the adrenaline rush of the action sequences is the primary audience pleaser. Surpassing Rogue Nation, which had mid-tier heist stunts, Fallout jumps an even bigger shark with such style and grace that one cannot help but wonder in awe of the absurdity McQuarrie presents on screen. Cruise effectively turns Hunt into a mix of Captain America and Evil Knievel, chucking reality straight out the window. Throughout the stunts, McQuarrie and film editor Eddie Hamilton create a terrific visual narrative flow, and cinematographer Rob Hardy’s use of both medium and long shots in the IMAX format is especially impressive, pushing the IMAX format to its limit, comparable to Nolan’s The Dark Knight. Whether it is Paris’ night cityscape during an intense HALO jump or car and boat chases during the day, each MI6 frame pops with texture and exquisite attention to detail. The best example of the crew’s talents does not come from the more dangerous moments, but, rather, from the smaller ones. McQuarrie’s directorial expertise shines during a tightly storyboarded fight sequence inside a Paris nightclub bathroom. In this scene, the camera is both wide in scope and tightly focused. There is a constant sense of dread, and with hardly any cross-cutting, McQuarrie infuses this imminent danger into the audience’s view. The MI6 editing is lightning fast and crisp; the direction and tone of the film is a hybrid of sorts. It combines the grittiness of the bathroom fight from True Lies (1994) and the cold precision of the restroom scene in Jeong-beom Lee’s The Man from Nowhere (2010). Due to a real sense of immersion in this scene, one feels the pain the characters are experiencing. The audience remains grounded in the heat of the moment and is never playing catch up due to choppy framing or blocking of the shot. Finally, one must consider the Tom Cruise factor, the essence of the film itself. Cruise once again proves he is an actor sewn from a unique material that is all his own. His ability to be both mentally and physically capable of pulling off all his stunts is unparalleled. The fact he learned to fly a helicopter for a chase sequence that rivals cinema’s best — including Bullitt (1968) and The French Connection (1971) — makes the film worth the price of admission. What merits criticism, however, in the MI6 depiction of Hunt’s scripted wholesomeness. We now have a version of this character whose feats of strength and sense of moral justice come off as two dimensional and rather cartoonish. Hunt is no longer the genuine, somewhat flawed guy who first endeared viewers back in 1996. Based on the reported influence that Cruise has on the franchise films, one assumes this specific portrayal of Hunt is based on the actor’s wishes for the character. I suspect that McQuarrie is afraid of challenging Cruise, who gave him big breaks with films like Jack Reacher (2012) and Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation. McQuarrie may feel a sense loyalty to Cruise’s vision, not his own, and based on the way he scripts Ilsa Faust, it is obvious that he can write morally confused characters. Now imagine what McQuarrie could do with Ethan Hunt. By the end of MI6, the biggest question left isn’t about how one can top these stunts, but what constitutes the next stage in Ethan Hunt’s character arc? Overall, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a good summer flick that won’t let you down if you’re searching for cinematic entertainment. McQuarrie has proven himself to be an excellent director for future installments and probably worthy of taking the helm of DC Comics’ film division at Warner Brothers. J.J. Abrams should stay on as a long-term producer of the Mission: Impossible films because he helped mold the series in a sustainable franchise. However, it’s Tom Cruise who may be the issue. Cruise must cease playing Hunt sooner than later, if not now. Otherwise, Mission: Impossible films could turn into a form of spy self-parody, outdoing the worst of the final Roger Moore James Bond films. When it comes to explaining this to Cruise in a polite but matter of fact manner, that might prove to be the most impossible mission of them all.

"Aug 24, 2022"," What started as a successful but slightly schizophrenic pet project has evolved into one of my very favorite movie franchises. Aside from the common thread of their high-profile star, the first three “Mission Impossible” installments couldn’t feel more different. It was mainly due to having three very different directors, each with their own unique stamp. While I enjoyed each of them to varying degrees, it was still tough to put a finger on what the series wanted to be. That started to change with “Ghost Protocol” from director #4 Brad Bird. It put pieces in place and set the table for director #5 Christopher McQuarrie and what would be the best “MI” movie to date. “Rogue Nation” not only felt connected to its predecessor beyond Tom Cruise’s presence, but it was incredibly well made and left audiences with a much clearer vision of what the franchise is shooting for. Fans of “Rogue Nation” rejoice. Christopher McQuarrie breaks the revolving director trend and returns for “Fallout”, a movie that ups the ante in terms of breathtaking action yet still tells a thrilling story that well serves its fabulous band of characters. McQuarrie has been working towards “Fallout”, building its framework for several films now. He did uncredited rewrites for “Ghost Protocol”, co-wrote “Rogue Nation”, and handles the entire script for “Fallout”. This is his baby and he knocks it out of the park. Of course Cruise returns along with mainstays Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg. Also back is Rebecca Ferguson who debuted and stole the show in “Rogue Nation”. In a prologue 56-year-old (but far from looking it) Cruise’s Ethan Hunt is informed that three plutonium cores have been stolen by a terrorist group calling themselves The Apostles. They are an offshoot of the Syndicate (see “Rogue Nation”) ran by a mystery man named John Lark. Ethan calls in his IMF cohorts, the neurotic Benji (Pegg) and easy-going Luther (Rhames), to help regain the cores, but the mission goes awry and the plutonium heads to the black market. Ethan is able to track the plutonium to Paris where a transaction is set to take place near the Grand Palais. Before he can head that way freshly christened CIA Director Sloane (Angela Bassett) orders him to take along Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA ‘observer’ and Sloane’s own personal “hammer”. Basically he’s sent to make sure the mission succeeds whatever the cost. As Cavill says in his wriest and driest voice “That’s the job.” If you follow the series you know the story can’t possible stay in one location. In addition to Paris we make stops in Belfast, London, even Kashmir (played by Norway). Along the way we get a white-knuckled motorcycle chase around the Arc de Triomphe, a foot race across London rooftops (which actually resulted in Cruise breaking his ankle), a mind-blowing helicopter duel through the snow-capped mountains of Kashmir, just to name a few. The action sequences are nothing short of exhilarating, mostly done through traditional stunt work and practical effects. The touches of CGI make a handful of scenes even more breathtaking. And what’s best is McQuarrie shoots them with visual coherence. No indecipherable shaky cams and quick cuts. It’s something to behold. But “Fallout” is more that credits-to-credits action. McQuarrie threads these sequences together with a classic-style spy story full of twists, double-crosses, intersecting plotlines and of course one big nuclear threat. In the middle of it all is returning “Rogue Nation” baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), an anarchist with a personal axe to grind with the current world order and with Ethan Hunt. His two-headed mantra “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace” is just as much directed at Ethan as to the world system. Adding another kink is the resurfacing of Ilsa Faust (Ferguson), once out of the game but now back in and with her own mysterious agenda. McQuarrie moves us through his wonderfully knotty plot at a crackling pace, tossing us enough twists and turns to ensure there is no downtime for measuring if every piece lines up perfectly. But it’s smart enough to keep us locked in and constantly guessing. And Cruise remains the heart of the franchise. His insane physicality and daredevil willingness to risk life and limb for every shot has never been more evident. But it’s the character-centric moments that speak volumes. He’s still a vulnerable hero, even a bit naïve. And more than any other “M:I” installment, “Fallout” centralizes his unshakable moral code as key component of not just this film but the entire series. “Mission: Impossible” continues to be the rare film franchise that actually gets better with age. “Fallout” makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel. Instead it takes the best elements of its predecessors and then cranks the dial past 10. Cruise and company’s ability to consistently up their game has culminated in this action movie masterclass that earns every ounce of acclaim it’s getting. Knowing their history I’m definitely onboard for more. But if the next movie’s mission, should they choose to accept it, is to top “Fallout” it could truly prove to be impossible. You have me really pumped to see this .  I have really liked the last 2 and wondered after the last one how they could surpass that one .  One the best movie franchises ever. As you know I was pretty excited for this but over the last few days I dialed back my expectations a bit. It ended up exceeding them. Do you know when you’ll get to see it? These pictures have done got old and they do the same thing over and over. They always cuss at them meddling kids for pulling their false face off, and That Tom Cruiser lady can’t act. All she does is show them white teeth and then frown with her serious face. I have to say this film is easily the best one in the series.  This film along with the last two, as you pointed out earlier, have finally given Mission Impossible its identity, and it works on multiple levels.  While there were some predictable twists, the rate at which they kept coming had me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire film. Wasn’t it great? I’m with you – edge of your seat stuff. I’m hoping McQuarrie sticks around because he has something really special here. How was the crowd at your showing? I’m really hoping it does well. Since I went in the morning, there really wasn’t much of a crowd.  I have no doubt in my mind that Fallout is going to make money.  I’ll have to check out Box Office Mojo in a day or so, but I think it’s definitely going to make back its budget by the time Monday comes around.   I’m probably going to go see it again.  Tom Cruise is like 57, but to see him do all his own stunts is mind-boggling.  I’m hoping he can keep it up for at least two more Mission Impossible films. Planning on seeing again too. Just love this thing. I don’t give many 5 star scores (this is my first this year), but this one deserves it. So I definitely want to see it again before it leaves the big screen. Ooooh Cindy, it is one heck of a ride. And hopefully you can see it on the big screen. It’s well worth a trip to the theater. I had a big grin on my face in most of this movie, but none bigger than when Cruise is just BOOKING it through London and McQuarrie’s got the wide shots. Legendary stuff, dare I say. Dude me too! I ate it all up. And Cruise’s stunt work is icing on the tension-filled cake (did that even make sense?). For me it’s more than a gimmick. Subconsciously knowing that him out there adds to the intensity for me. Great review! Glad you liked it! To me, while it doesn’t beat out the original film or Ghost Protocol, Fallout is definitely a great and solid action flick. Loved it. I noticed that too. I was surprised afterwards when I realized how long it was. It zips by. Hoping to give it another look this week. Great review Keith! Funny you should mention the overused quick-cut/shaky-cam method of action filmmaking, I was watching J.J. Abrams’ ‘M:I III’ and whilst it’s certainly enjoyable that’s always my main gripe when rewatching it.  It was cooland inventive when Bourne did it but it’s really become nauseous and lazy. What I especially appreciate is that although we have a returning director, McQuarrie brings a slightly different style and feel to the film in comparison with Rogue Nation that sort of respects the original mission (ahem) statement for the franchise of having a new director come in with each new instalment and make it their own. Thanks so much. That jerky cam stuff drives me bonkers especially on a large screen. I always think back to the last two “Taken” films and how choppy their action sequences are. I always wondered if it was a way to compensate for Liam Neeson (who I love) not being the prototypical athletic action hero. Fallout definitely has a slightly different style. I felt it was a touch darker than the last film while still hanging onto its fun sense of humor. It’s a delicate balance and McQuarrie handles it REALLY well. Haven’t seen this yet but I’m eager to now. They keep hitting this one out of the ballpark. A series that has got stronger and is now making its best entries in the franchise. Oh man, this is a must watch on the big screen. Definitely see it before it leaves the theater. I’m still amazed at how they up the ante without dumbing down their movies. LOVE IT. Loving the review. Spot on! I think Fallout is the best MI movie so far. I’m not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise on a personal level but what he does as an actor is incredible! I think I’m with you. I love the franchise especially Rogue Nation (thank you Rebecca Fergusson), but I do think this tops them all. Did you happen to see it in IMAX. I hoping to before it leaves my area. Most of the M:I movies are fine stand alone films. This one is a little different. You would still be fine watching it on its own, but there are several things directly connected to the last movie. I’m amazed at how they manage to consistently bring the quality with the MI movies… how have they not jumped the shark yet? It must be the same magic Tom Cruise uses to keep himself from aging. It’s pretty amazing. And not only bring the quality, but make the movies steadily better. I’m really impressed and can’t wait to finally see it again.",POSITIVE
"May 19, 2022",Even in their sixth installment&#44; the Mission&#58; Impossible films remain a breath of fresh air amidst the CGI-fueled superhero spectacles of the summer&#46;,POSITIVE
"Mar 11, 2022"," Tom Cruise is the cinema’s greatest action star. Fortunately, such a hyperbolic claim is not without an argument to back it up. Around the dawn of the last century, Douglas Fairbanks swashbuckled his way to fame by climbing walls, riding horses, and swinging from ropes in titles like The Mark of Zorro (1920) or Robin Hood (1922). Although Fairbanks was an accomplished gymnast, he eventually conceded to use stunt doubles for the most daring feats. After Fairbanks, Errol Flynn took the crown, having shot his own arrows and performed dangerous sword fights in The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) and The Sea Hawk (1940). In the subsequent decades, actors including Tyrone Power, Bruce Lee, Harrison Ford, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and others became action icons, but few could actually perform the exploits of their characters and instead relied on the talents of stunt workers. Perhaps because their skills are evident onscreen, martial artists have dominated cinematic bravado in recent decades, allowing for Jackie Chan and Jason Statham to impress with their ability to carry out elaborately choreographed fights. But how many of these actors, from Fairbanks to Chan, have tied themselves to the side of a plane? How many have driven at top speeds in fast-paced motorcycle races, hung from a helicopter in midair, climbed mountains without a net, outran an exploding aquarium, or held his breath underwater for several minutes? How many have dangled on the tallest building in the world? Only Cruise has subjected himself to such exploits and more for the sake of screen action, and the above-listed examples remain restricted to the Mission: Impossible franchise, still going strong since its dazzling Brian De Palma debut in 1996. The sixth entry, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, contains some series-best spectacles, among them a memorable car chase to rival the one in The French Connection (1971), brutal hand-to-hand combat, and a breathless helicopter chase—for which Cruise learned to fly helicopters and then piloted his own craft in the film. Director Christopher McQuarrie, who captained the previous entry, Rogue Nation, sells every incredible set-piece not just because he realizes the proceedings in such a clearly presented way, complete with an effortless shot-by-shot logic and visual cohesion, but because Cruise sells the most unbelievable moments in the film by actually performing them. There’s very little reliance on CGI, allowing, subconsciously, the viewer to recognize, somewhere in the back of our minds, that what we’re seeing onscreen is real—as opposed to the usual Hollywood confection. Cruise and McQuarrie engross the viewer by making the most outlandish stunts look and feel like they really happened. More than the first two titles in the Mission: Impossible franchise, the last few have maintained a relatively steady character base and plot after J.J. Abrams reinvigorated the material in 2006. But Fallout follows closely the events and characters from Rogue Nation, and even maintains the same villain and supporting players. IMF point man Ethan Hunt, backed by his behind-the-scenes tech support Luther (Ving Rhames) and his other techie-turned-field-man Benji (Simon Pegg), operates under the close watch of their new department head, Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Hunt’s team has been tasked with taking down The Apostles, a terrorist faction devoted to the notion that “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace”—hence their resolution to cause as much suffering across the globe as possible. The Apostles follow in the footsteps of their former leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who was imprisoned by Hunt and Co. at the end of the last film. One of Lane’s devotees named John Lark, presumably a double agent in US intelligence, hopes to acquire three plutonium cores in an effort to create three nuclear weapons. Hunt’s team accepts the impossible mission to identify Lark, recover the cores, and stop Lane’s Apostles once and for all. At the same time, the CIA’s Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) demands one of her agents, the towering brute August Walker (Henry Cavill), oversee Hunt’s progress. She calls Walker the hammer to Hunt’s scalpel, and more than once, Walker’s unsubtle approach smashes the IMF’s carefully laid plans. Returning to the mix is Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), a former MI6 agent who walked away from her life of undercover spying in Lane’s Syndicate. Which is to say, it’s helpful if Fallout’s audience remembers the events in Rogue Nation, even Mission: Impossible III, to appreciate in full the emotional significance of the events here. To be sure, Hunt’s estranged wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, makes several appearances in the film, lending to Hunt’s characterization as a man driven by a terrifying fear that, should Lane and his cohorts succeed, he’ll be unable to save the people who matter most to him. For Sloan, Hunt’s willingness to sacrifice the success of an entire mission, in which millions of lives hang in the balance, in exchange for a single life, means the agent has been compromised. The script, written by McQuarrie, rewards those who pay close attention to the plot machinations and twists throughout, without dwelling on moments or dumbing them down for an inattentive audience. About mid-film, an unassuming sequence that takes place in a series of underground tunnels contains about three twists and double-crosses in a matter of minutes, each more effective and unpredictable than the last, and McQuarrie allows them to unfold thoughtfully, trusting his audience to keep up. Not that it requires much to follow the story, as McQuarrie efficiently sketches out the stakes early in the film’s breezes-by two-and-a-half-hour runtime. The structure, modeled after the Hitchcockian ideal of grabbing the viewer from the first sequence and not letting go, never allows the viewer a moment of ease. Alfred Hitchcock has long been an influence on the franchise, from the elegantly conceived set pieces to the wrong-man-thriller elements, to the way each film forces the viewer to hold their breath until the last possible moment. Throughout the remainder, the audience follows along, either invested in the weighty dramatic arcs for characters like Hunt, Ilsa, and Benji, or attuned to the remarkable action. Most viewers will walk away from Fallout exhilarated, talking about Cruise’s stunts or the downright exhausting chases (by motorcycle, automobile, helicopter, and foot), but the story rewards those invested in the characters. And while McQuarrie’s script contains less humor or moments of levity than the previous two sequels, the lofty threat of nuclear genocide and personal loss intensifies the stakes more than previous missions. McQuarrie began his string of collaborations with Tom Cruise as the screenwriter of Valkyrie (2008); he later directed the actor on Jack Reacher (2012) and also contributed to the deft scripting on Edge of Tomorrow (2014). Even with McQuarrie’s accomplished filmmaking on Rogue Nation, his work on Fallout is a leap in craft and skill. He’s elevated himself from a screenwriter-turned-director to an extraordinarily accomplished visualist with a fully realized aesthetic. Shot by Rob Hardy (Annihilation), there’s a soft, Nolan-esque sheen to the proceedings, recalling the look of Inception or The Dark Knight. Hardy’s rather straightforward, plainly presented lensing of the action, along with Eddie Hamilton’s editing, capture the daring and death-defying stunts in all their considerable glory. The production seems engineered to make the most of Cruise’s devotion to action realism, particularly in the last 20 minutes when Hunt inches up a payload rope attached to the bottom of a helicopter, guides himself inside to the front of the craft, and then takes over above the mountains of Kashmir, India—a stunt marked by its balance of suspense amid beautiful scenery. What’s more, Cruise performs some extraordinary motorcycle work, becomes the first actor to perform a high-altitude skydive, and runs in a wowing extended pursuit (he has long been Hollywood’s best runner). Any of these sequences is incomparable, and yet Fallout is filled with them. Then again, McQuarrie and the 56-year-old Cruise are unafraid to acknowledge that the star may be dimming. Opposite the broad-shouldered Cavill (today’s Superman), who towers over Cruise, Hunt isn’t the invincible hero he once was. In Fallout, he’s out of his depth more than once, which, of course, makes the film all the more thrilling. Over the course of six films, the Mission: Impossible franchise has remained mostly consistent (with the exception of the abominable second film by director John Woo), deepening its hold on viewers with each new entry. With Fallout, McQuarrie delivers not only the best film in the franchise after De Palma’s slick original, but one of the great films of artfully photographed and technically monumental action—to be included on a list alongside other titles of similarly grand scope and design: The Road Warrior (1982), Aliens (1986), Die Hard (1988), Heat (1997), Skyfall (2012), and Mad Max: Fury Road (2015). Above all, Fallout reminds us that neither Cruise’s talent nor the enduring quality of his Mission: Impossible films should be taken for granted. Each new sequel attempts something new, something we’ve never seen before, and does this with a sense of spy-thriller panache that no other action franchise has matched with such unbridled showmanship and consistent, keeps-you-guessing story. Audiences will be watching McQuarrie’s direction and Cruise’s stuntwork for years to come, reflecting with a sense of awe over how they accomplished what they did, and how rare it is that the filmmakers took the risk to achieve it.",POSITIVE
"Feb 12, 2022"," Tom Cruise is back as IMF agent Ethan Hunt in “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.” This is the sixth installment of the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, and I have to say that the series just keeps getting better. At this point, besides the Bond films, it has a good shot at becoming one of the greatest franchises in cinema history (along with James Bond, of course). It beats the “Fast and Furious” franchise by a long shot, that’s for sure. The last film, “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation” was probably the best installment to date with a very slight lead over “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.” “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” stars Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Henry Cavill as August Walker, Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell, Sean Harris as Solomon Lane, Angela Basset as Erica Sloan, Vanessa Kirby as White Widow, Michelle Monaghan as Julia Meade-Hunt, Alec Baldwin as Alan Hunley, Wes Bentley as Patrick and Frederick Schmidt as Zola. The marketing team was having a field day promoting “REAL STUNTS” with “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” and for good reason. One of the main draws of this film is that in a world of CGI, seeing Cruise  perform these insane stunts for the sake of the film is inspiring and freaking intense. As a moviegoer, watching them play out one-by-one in “Fallout” made me anxious because I knew that they were mostly real. That’s what a summer blockbuster should be. In a world full of CGI, be a “Mission: Impossible.” (I hope The Rock is taking notes). The film is directed and written by Christopher McQuarrie, who penned the last film as well. He’s the first director to stay on for multiple films and I’m not complaining. In preparation for “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” I watched all five movies back-to-back. What struck me from the get-go is how disconnected the first, second and third feel from each other. Luckily, the franchise didn’t stop at a trilogy, or it would’ve done a great disservice. When you go from the third, fourth and fifth installment, there’s much more continuity, fleshing out of characters and getting to what Ethan Hunt is all about. Unlike a Bond or John Wick, Hunt is the only of these characters who is morally grounded, for better or worse. He cares deeply enough about his team to sabotage a mission if one of them is in danger. It’s a fault, but it’s one that is honorable in a character and sets Hunt apart. One of the things that “Fallout” does well – and I can’t sing the praises high enough – is showing the wear and tear the spy game has had on Hunt. Not all of his plans work out in this one. Cavill’s character, Walker, is there to point out how ridiculous some of Hunt’s plans sound, including the infamous masks – a nod to the crazy antics the series has pulled off. I liked that we saw some flaws and saw Hunt in situations that weren’t always going to go his way. This is where a character like Hunt can shine, and seems like a callback to the action heroes of yesteryear (AKA ’90s). It’s when they are down and out that they do their best work. Think Bruce Willis in the “Die Hard” franchise. Another highlight of “Fallout” is that it clears up the whole romantic trio that started emerging in “Rogue Nation,” with the Faust character mirroring Hunt. We never really saw Julia in the last installment, only at the end of the fourth film, “Ghost Protocol.” I didn’t mind the missing mention, because as a viewer you can assume shit happened. One is not exactly going to have a happily-ever-after in spy world. Also, I don’t like a lot of romance in my spy thrillers or action films if it’s not called for. I don’t need to have a damsel in distress to get me to root for the hero. However, in Hunt’s case, this love triangle is heartbreaking and satisfying. It was really touching to have Rhames’s character, Luther, who has been the only character to last the whole series, deliver the heartfelt speech to Faust about Hunt and his two lady loves. Clearly, Faust and Hunt have something brewing even though no kisses have been exchanged. I mean, she’s basically the female version of Hunt and, dare I say, slightly better having saved his butt a few times. I don’t know how they wouldn’t fall in love given these scenarios. I have to mention Vanessa Kirby as White Widow because I am huge fan of hers from her portrayal of Princess Margaret in Netflix’s “The Crown.” She was the perfect White Widow and held her own against the seasoned Cruise. Bravo! Okay, let’s get to the stunts. There’s skydiving into a lightning storm, motorcycling through the streets of Paris, and a HELICOPTER chase, among others, plus an amazing, heart-pumping score to accompany all the action. There’s one scene early on in the film, that is probably one of the best action sequences I’ve seen in a long time. Kudos to Cruise, Cavill and Liang Lang as Lark Decoy. You can see a snippet of that scene in the trailer with Cavill’s infamous arm pumps! Honestly, as an action fiend longing for the days of real stunts, I was in heaven watching “Mission: Impossible – Fallout.” It was the right amount of practical, with the slightly ‘oh, come on!’ experience, which is what I want in a movie. Cruise is better than ever and, however you feel about him as a person, one thing you can’t deny is that he brings the Hollywood blockbuster A-game and we’re all the better for it. With all good things, there are some tiny flaws I have to point out. Henry Cavill. Bless his Superman heart. Look, I love Cavill ever since he was the sidekick to a former “Mission: Impossible” alum, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, in “The Tudors,” but I have to say it: his delivery of the lines are, at times, comical and cringy. I don’t know what it is, but he needs to work on it. There were also some weird transitions from Luther’s speech that felt out of place among other moments, but those are forgivable. All in all, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is bringing action back and I can’t get enough.

"Aug 21, 2021"," From the moment the fuse lights for the opening credits, there isn't a single second for you to catch your breath in Mission: Impossible – Fallout. This is the best, most relentless, most well-executed action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road.
Tom Cruise jumps out of a plane, hangs from a rope attached to a helicopter and leaps across London rooftops, all at age 56. And this is just a fraction of the jaw-dropping action scenes sprinkled throughout this two-and-a-half-hour thrill ride. Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt, alongside Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). They've lost a case of stolen plutonium, which is now in the hands of the Apostles, the remnants of the Syndicate from Rogue Nation. So the CIA adds Walker (Henry Cavill) to keep tabs on Hunt and make sure he doesn't lose any more assets. But as Walker asks in one pivotal scene, ""How many times has Hunt's government betrayed him? How long until someone like that has had enough?"" It's a fair question, as moles and traitors have threatened his life and killed his team members in past movies. But that's nothing compared to the double and triple crosses in store in Fallout. Much of the film takes place in Paris, and that chunk of the film is among the best 30- to 40-minute stretches of any film ever, including a one-shot HALO jump, the bathroom fight that features Cavill pumping his fists like he's reloading a gun, a nightclub brawl, a car chase/heist that's extremely reminiscent of The Dark Knight, and a subsequent motorcycle chase that tops Rogue Nation and M:i-2. I literally gasped on more than one occasion. And this isn't even to women the terrific women of the cast, none of whom are leered at or used as pawns. Three in Ethan's orbit (Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and Angela Bassett) do a great job of keeping their intentions murky, so we're never sure who's side they're on exactly. There's also a major reunion in the third act that Cruise plays with the right mix of happiness giving way to horror. There's a lot of personal stakes in this film, which make it matter a lot more than the typical end-of-the-world stuff (which is also present). The inevitable bomb diffusion feels a little weightier because of the people Ethan feels like he's letting down, which could play as callous in the wrong hands. But Christopher McQuarrie had already delivered some solid action movies. Now, he's made a certifiable masterpiece.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 24, 2021"," I have something to confess. I have never seen a single Mission: Impossible movie in my life. I had no idea what I was in for when I entered the theater to see the newest installment of the spy franchise. Apparently I’ve been missing out on a lot. What begins as a standard action flick very quickly turns into something else entirely. Something unlike anything I have ever seen before. The second the film reaches an early scene where the indestructible Ethan Hunt (the indestructible Tom Cruise) is about to jump out of a plane roughly five miles up in the sky, and you realize that what you’re about to see is real, with no green screen and no stunt double, you know you’re in for something special. What is Mission: Impossible – Fallout about? They try to keep it simple. Some bad guys have gotten their hands on plutonium and are going to make some nukes. It’s up to Ethan Hunt and his elite team (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) to stop them and get that plutonium back. Along the way they have to contend with the CIA and their operative, August Walker (Henry Cavill), and MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who are going after the plutonium as well. It’s paper-thin, and none of the characters seem to have much of a personality (although that could be attributed to me not seeing any of the previous films), but in this particular case none of that seems to matter.  The story and its characters are all just background noise in Fallout. This movie’s focus is completely on the enormous action set pieces and the outrageous stunts shown in them. There are many of them, and they are jaw-dropping in their presentation. You can’t help but be impressed and blown away by the sheer amount of work put into this thing. Fallout had three thousand set-ups, thirteen helicopters, four weeks of aerial photography, and shooting took place on three different continents. Tom Cruise, an insane human being(?) in every possible way, trained for an entire year to be prepared for the HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) jump stunt, a sequence that gets your heart practically beating out of your chest, and makes your eyes unable to look away from what you’re witnessing onscreen.  This is the movie that broke Cruise’s ankle while he was performing a stunt where he leaps from building to building, and wouldn’t you know it, that’s the take they use in the movie itself. You can see him limp away from his hard fall and continue running. There’s a white-knuckle, high-speed, helmet-free motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris, which includes a portion in which Cruise speeds against traffic in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe. The finale includes a helicopter chase through snowy mountains in which Cruise does most of the piloting himself. All of these are done mostly without green screens and CG (if there are any, they’re not at all noticeable), and the way that all of it is done practically is truly something to behold in all of its glory, preferably on an  IMAX screen. In a perfect world, this is the film that finally gets the Oscars to add a category for stunts.  Lorne Balfe’s (The Florida Project, The LEGO Batman Movie) score is incredible. It’s loud, boisterous, full of life and energy, and a brilliant reminder of what makes a movie’s soundtrack so much fun. The film makes expert use of it, blaring it during certain action scenes so that all other noise is basically muted, or having no score at all, letting the insane stunts you’re watching speak for themselves. Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) never pulls the camera away. It’s with the action every step of the way, supplying plenty of long, continuous takes coupled with far-away wide shots that work to show you the true scope of these insane stunts (like Tom Cruise dangling on a rope attached to a helicopter, something else he actually did in real life). Make no mistake, this film is an adrenaline rush. You’ll feel like you chugged down several Red Bulls after leaving the theater; your heart will be racing and you’ll have to fight the urge to speed out of the parking lot like a madman.  There aren’t any correct words I can use to describe exactly what the experience of seeing this film is in a theater. It’s something you have to go through yourself. Don’t worry about the plot because none of it seems to matter anyway. It’s all an excuse to move along from one action set piece to the next. But you won’t mind. I certainly didn’t. Hollywood has been churning out giant blockbusters for years now where every action scene is a CG-filled party, so it is astounding to see a movie like this where nearly everything that you’re seeing is real and tangible. It’s what makes it feel like such a genuine thrill ride. It’s the perfect summer action movie. It’s edge-of-your-seat excitement, and you need to make like Tom Cruise and run, and run, and run some more to experience it on the biggest screen you can find.

"Feb 28, 2021"," Writing a review for “Mission Impossible – Fallout” gave my thesaurus a workout. The film, the sixth instalment in the Tom Cruise franchise, is jammed to the gills with next-level stunts that require an expanded vocabulary to describe. Words like ‘extreme’ or ‘exciting’ or even ‘epic’ (and those are only the ‘e’ words) don’t come close to describing the behemothic action sequences contained within. Cruise returns as the seemingly invincible action man and IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agent Ethan Hunt. Hunt and his crew, tech wiz Benji (Simon Pegg) and agent Luther (Ving Rhames), are charged with finding and capturing anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a baddie who was the leader of the Syndicate during the last film, “Rogue Nation.” “Whatever you heard about Lane,” explains Hunt, “if it makes your skin crawl it’s probably true.” Lane is working with the mysterious and murderous John Lark, a man with some extreme ideas about squashing the world order. As Lark and Lane collect the necessary plutonium to fulfil their plan the CIA begins to have doubts about Hunt’s loyalty. Add to that the return of former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and some newbies, CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) and black market arms dealer and lady of mystery White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) and you have lots of characters to fill the space between the stunts. Complicating matters is the fallout from some of Hunt’s previous, well-intentioned missions. There are a lot of very good-looking people in “Mission Impossible – Fallout.” Handsome fellas and femme fatale‘s, they are all woven into a stylish story of international intrigue and plutonium. Like the others “MI” movies it’s packed with exotic locations—only James Bond has more air travel points than Ethan Hunt—doublespeak and double crosses but the narrative doesn’t matter that much, it’s all in service of the Bunyanesque action. Choreographed to an inch of Hunts life—Cruise really puts himself out there for this one—the realism of the stunts gives the movie a sense of danger and the Green Screen Department the day off. Monumental, vertigo inducing single sequences take place on land, wheels, water and air. Only the screeching of tires score one eye-peeling chase scene between a motorcycle and a car. Visually it is so visceral director Christopher McQuarrie wisely avoided cluttering the scene with frenetic music. It doesn’t need it. Of course those looking for a finely crafted John le Carré style story of espionage in “Mission Impossible – Fallout” will be bitterly disappointed. While it does contain huggerymuggery it frequently falls just this side of making sense. That’s not to say it isn’t entertaining. Even when Hunt isn’t in action the movie is in perpetual motion, but Frederick Forsyth this ain’t. Instead it is an elephantine (although no actual elephants appear) action epic that breaks the blockbuster norm of cutting away to an action sequence every ten minutes or so. It’s made up of three Brobdingnagian set pieces stitched together by words that mostly make sense.

"Jan 29, 2021"," They just don't make them like this anymore. In the age of superheroes and large-scale sci-fi epics, Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a refreshing throwback to balls-to-the-wall stuntwork that manages to thrill and amaze just as adeptly as its shinier CGI brethren. The first true sequel in a six-film franchise, Tom Cruise's iron will to entertain with insane physical setpieces, along with Christopher McQuarrie's sharp script and direction, mark this Mission as one of the best. Mild spoilers ahead... Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the latest entry in the Tom Cruise-starring spy franchise, is ironically also the most analog of the series. A dangerous nighttime HALO jump, a frantic chase through the streets of Paris, a sweeping helicopter dogfight through the icy mountains of Kashmir - these are just some of the breathtaking setpieces that take place during the film, and for the most part performed for real by Cruise and company. Fallout is a relentless thrill ride that thrives on practical stuntwork, with its charms conveyed not through a CGI editing bay, but through the notion that Tom Cruise will jump out of an airplane over a hundred times to capture that perfect shot. Even within its own franchise, Fallout explodes forth with its refreshing and reliquary charms; gone are the CGI security camera shenanigans and exploding Kremlins of Ghost Protocol, and gone are the complex underwater heists of director Christopher McQuarrie’s previous Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. This latest installment, the first direct sequel of the series, instead focuses on visceral thrills sans any bells and whistles. And it works like gangbusters. Taking place two years after the excellent Rogue Nation, Mission: Impossible - Fallout sends Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) hurtling on another world-saving adventure after a botched attempt to recover stolen plutonium. The bad guys this time around are The Apostles, splintered remnants of The Syndicate still loyal to anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) after he was put away at the end of Rogue Nation. When Hunt is forced to bust Lane out of Interpol custody in order to retrieve the plutonium spheres, a race against the clock to avert nuclear catastrophe begins. Complicating matters is the addition of August Walker (Henry Cavill, flexing his physicality even more than he did as Superman), a CIA assassin tasked with keeping Hunt and his IMF compatriots on a short leash. Rebecca Ferguson, by far the best part of Rogue Nation, makes a welcome return as Ilsa Faust, an MI6 agent with her own mysterious agenda. Her role as friend as well as foil hasn’t changed much from the previous film, but Ferguson’s wild-card portrayal is so charming that one finds it hard to complain. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a twisty film full of swerves and betrayals, but not exactly undpredictable - big reveals are heavily telegraphed, and the film’s primary twist is almost disappointingly rote - but where Fallout succeeds is in the execution of the plot. The film dips heavily into the trope jar when it comes to its surprises, but there is always a refreshing and exciting spin that will put a big grin on your face, even if you do see the end result coming a mile away. It also helps that Fallout’s momentum is nothing short of explosive - the film’s 147 minute runtime feels like a blink of the eye when you’re watching Tom Cruise barrel through setpiece after setpiece, seemingly with zero regard for his own safety. Mission: Impossible - Fallout will stimulate the dormant sections of your adrenaline centers, a kind of thrill long missing from action cinema that exploding CGI spaceships and massive destruction can’t even begin to mimic.  Mission: Impossible - Fallout  is the most fun you’ll have at the movies this summer, with a brand of action and spectacle that Hollywood just doesn’t produce anymore. At 56 years young, there’s no sign of Tom Cruise slowing down in his quest to entertain. His mission with this franchise, which he always chooses to accept, is to work as hard as he can to deliver over-the-top stunts and outdo his last effort, and Fallout is the best one yet. One can only imagine what the next installment will bring. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 7, 2020"," fter megalomaniacal terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was apprehended several years ago by the IMF, a new threat has emerged in his place. In their leader’s absence, his underlings have formed the “Apostles,” a mysterious group of mercenaries hellbent on continuing in their madman commander’s footsteps. When renounced scientist Nils Delbruuk’s (Kristoffer Joner) designs for a complex set of nuclear bombs are uncovered, the IMF team, including Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), must intercept the three plutonium spheres intended for the weapons before they fall into the wrong hands. When the mission sours, the CIA assigns arrogant agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to accompany the IMF on their next task of locating the missing radioactive metal. As the group tracks their prize to cunning arms dealer “White Widow” (Vanessa Kirby) and elusive assassin John Lark, they engage in a treacherous chase across the globe where a second failure would mean the deaths of millions. Since the series is already six feature films deep, it’s not surprising that this latest entry begins with a number of references to the previous chapters, without much explanation for anyone not caught up. Clearly, the filmmakers aren’t too concerned with gaining fresh fans; instead, they’re hoping to keep the existing enthusiasts who can’t get enough of impossible missions (accomplished always in the nick of time, just as the world is about to succumb to a nuclear holocaust – or within a split second as a bullet is diverted, a knife thrust is blocked, or a parachute needs to open to avoid splattering the heroes across landmarks). To the film’s credit, even with all of the repetition, it definitely lives up to its name. The extremist splinter cell that has been causing troubles for Hunt and his team sounds a lot like James Bond’s SPECTRE, but the last few “Mission: Impossible” entries have managed to avoid the utter dreariness that has been consuming 007 of late. Here, there’s a sensational blend of humor and action, refraining from dismal severity yet staying well out of the range of campy. Hunt probably needs to be willing to kill his enemies more often, but his reluctance enables him to be a clearcut hero, which is refreshing amidst the more common antiheroes that pervade cinemas. And though several of the early ruses aren’t terribly clever, particularly as the 3D-printed faces that everyone dons hints at the likelihood of switches, the plot doesn’t go overboard with the mug-swapping, even though the dialogue makes the grave error of pointing out the signature silliness of this franchise. “The IMF is Halloween: a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat,” huffs the CIA chief, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Believable tech makes an appearance as well, aiming to offset the sci-fi components, highlighted by altitude gear, tracking devices, and computer readouts. The cloak-and-dagger elements also escalate, allowing the story to rely on spy games just as much as the action, despite Ethan’s successes always depending on plenty of luck. “Hope is not a strategy!” Infiltrations, ambushes, extractions, surveilling, tailing, assassins, globetrotting, and shootouts make their standard appearances, too, rounding out – and perhaps needlessly prolonging – the adventure. One of the film’s greatest strengths, however, is that sense of adventure, especially when the stuntwork ensures that Tom Cruise’s features are very much visible for the majority of the shots. His notable dedication to performing his own stunts is admirable, as well as convincing, though most audiences will probably fail to realize just how much effort and pain went into the final product. Martial arts fights are tense, while heists are nicely chaotic (one sequence artistically removes all sounds and sound effects for a welcome change of pace) and the protracted chase scenes are mesmerizing (the bulk of the second act is little more than a chase that segues into another chase that segues into yet another chase, frequently changing speeds, locations, and even modes of transportation). But it’s the finale that really steals the show, making the best of editing and cuts to distract viewers from the fact that virtually every one of the IMF’s tasks boils down to the diffusing of a bomb. And the music is once again outstanding, bolstering every sequence with the right amount of verve.

"Aug 26, 2020"," In an age of James Bond and Jason Bourne, the spy genre has become a constant re-evaluation of its modernity.  Both franchises have found a level of adaptability in understanding how the world mirrors the reality of its protagonists.  Not to be left behind, Mission Impossible has earned its right to be amongst the conversation.  Far removed from its 60s past of Peter Graves, Barbara Bain and Martin Landau, the franchise in its current format has culturally redefined its contextual history to this generation of film-goers.  Each film has been a new and enduring lease of life, embodying a stunt spectacle as well as a contemporary spy movie of its era with Tom Cruise as its committed leader. Mission: Impossible – Fallout represents the very best of the franchise. If there was a chance for the Oscars to update its proceedings, then a ‘Best Stunt’ category is long overdue and necessary. One of the many successes from the Mission Impossible franchise is its ability to challenge.  In many respects, it has become the Fast and the Furious of the spy genre, always finding bigger and better ways to outdo its previous film whilst retaining a seminal connected universe.  By proxy, it creates a fantastical familiarity but also a trope in itself where audiences can mindlessly escape without thinking too much of its relevance.  That characteristic has evolved as both franchises have “grown up” to become the behemoths that they are today; Fast Five changed its concept from street racing to a heist movie with cars.  While the stunt edge has always been present throughout, it’s safe to say that Ghost Protocol set Mission Impossible on its current trend of exhilaration. But Fallout is a different specimen, both tonally and as a retrospective piece, a game-changer as some would argue.  Director Christopher McQuarrie doesn’t rely on the laurels of the previous accomplishments of the franchise but decides to re-evaluate its purpose.  What does Mission Impossible and the IMF mean in the global terms of terrorism, political powers and the agencies designed to protect us?  Rogue Nation gave us glimpses of that ideology, putting the IMF on trial so to speak with its confrontations between William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) and Alan Hunley (Alex Baldwin).  But Fallout undertakes a personalised endeavour as a Bond-esque adventure (more Skyfall than Spectre) by forcing it to look at how it started and evolved.  Fallout might be a direct sequel to Rogue Nation but its lineage ties back to Brian De Palma’s 1996 classic. As a serious and measured spy film, McQuarrie’s imprint is an effective homage, not just to the franchise with its reminiscing stunt sequences but to the genre.  McQuarrie returns us to the world of what spying entails, so synonymous by trademark which we’ve seen in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Atomic Blonde and even James Bond under Connery in From Russia with Love. It’s a return of the Cold War ethics of double agents and crossings, clandestine meetings, shadowy conspiracies, infiltration and trades.  The fact that its first key scene takes place in Berlin, the historical hotspot of Cold War spies is a notable nod to its credibility.  The only thing missing would have been to film in black and white, capturing the undertones of film noir. It’s within this context that Fallout starts to re-evaluate the world and find some grounded perspective, taking a note out of Nolan’s playbook and what he achieved with The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight was a mirrored reflection and allegory of a Post 9/11 world and the efforts on the war on terror where fear was a stepping stone towards a fractious, unpredictable and destabilising chaos that exposed the moral foundations and rules we’ve built our lives upon.  The Joker (Heath Ledger) was unable to fulfil his ultimate plan of witnessing Gotham’s submission to that chaos thanks to Batman (Christian Bale) rescuing the soul of the city. However, his ability to turn a prominent figure, a hero in Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) towards the ‘dark side’ is one of those haunting and psychological traits about the corruption of the human spirit. A similar essence is explored in Fallout.  Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) might as well be The Joker of the MI franchise, someone who lives up to Alfred Pennyworth’s line about “some men just want to watch the world burn”.  Lane’s anti-institutional stance and zealot belief in resetting the world is as symbolically influential as Ra’s Al Ghul and The League of Shadows but represented as an upscaled version of The Syndicate called The Apostles.  Lane’s personal fascination with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) not only makes him a significant villain since the days of Philip Seymour Hoffman back in MI:3, but challenges the obsessive foundations of what Hunt stands for as a corruptible force to Hunt’s moral compass.  Therefore, Ethan Hunt may share some Batman like qualities, but he might as well be the ‘Harvey Dent’ in this equation.  They both share an almost ‘gung-ho’ attitude in stepping in front of danger and considering that once again Hunt has to prove his allegiance, lives up to Dent’s “you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.”  It’s a loyalty that audiences may never have questioned due to Hunt’s unprecedented heroics, but with each “impossible” mission, particularly in Fallout’s case, almost entertains the idea of a ‘dark side’. We witness that in a staged hospital scene of that supposed darkness and abject failure where the plutonium he needed to rescue out from the hands of the terrorists is used to bomb three global locations.  The darkness reappears in Hunt’s vision of the heist where he contemplates the possibility of killing innocent people to follow through with the exchange.  Even Hunt’s dreams have become a guilt-ridden infection due to Lane’s radicalised influence.  But coded within its dark, chaotic articulation and Lorne Balfe’s superb Zimmer-esque score, McQuarrie presents a paralleled understanding in the terrific Paris chase sequence.  The mirrored sense of anticipation and impending doom is a role reversal where instead of Harvey being used as bait to lure The Joker out, Ethan is preventing ‘The Joker’ from ending up in the wrong hands. What makes the motivations relatable as it is is how McQuarrie uses Fallout to establish that Ethan Hunt has become ‘the impossible mission’.  As Hunt dives head first into the unknown, he creates consequences, knowing each decision can have long-term damages. Does all of Hunt’s risk-taking actually surmount to anything when it removes one obstacle but creates a vacuum in its place?  What is it good for if the extent of that reach can recruit new followers at an astronomical rate?  How deep does that infection go when supposed allies and colleagues turn out to be double agents?  Fallout almost analyses Hunt as an internalised perspective of his character in the context of the entire franchise and his valued contribution to the world.  The mission itself is more of a personal expression than the physical exertions. It’s very obvious to suggest that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is just ‘more of the same’ from the franchise.  But the key distinction is that Fallout attempts to humanise the concept. This is not just in connection to Ethan Hunt (who will always remain the focal point) but with characters who have been with us since MI:3.  In its attempt to give a conclusion, these familiar characters help reinforce the danger and the sacrifices made. When Spectre clumsily attempted to build a cinematic universe at the last minute by shoehorning all of Craig’s Bond villains as part of the same organisation, the characters of Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) solidify Ethan’s world to allow a mission-driven universe to form naturally.  Ethan has a ‘win at all costs’ mentality in saving the world but his friends have become a cornerstone of his humanity so that the work he does is not always in vain. As a vehicle well-versed in cinema language, it’s how Fallout utilises tension and suspense to a Hitchcockian level.  Like with Psycho and its famous shower scene, Fallout is almost too claustrophobic, opting for an intense, up close and personal feel that puts its audience right into the centre of that action.  That ‘Deus Ex Machina’ that most films love to do by pulling a rabbit out of a hat whenever there is a tight situation would have felt like a cheat move under Fallout, and yet is never within close reach when you want that comforting safety. Similar to the efforts pulled with Rogue Nation and the brilliant opera scene, each stunt in Fallout is like a chain reaction of chaos that seems to escalate and evolve when you least expect it.  It’s no surprise that McQuarrie was directly influenced by the silent movie era of Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton because Fallout is very much a visual art piece of ’cause and effect’.  Films like Mad Max: Fury Road and John Wick: Chapter 2 have used action to that extent where if you turn the sound down, the stunts tell its own synchronised story.  The rising escalation and its upgraded complexity operate like a cinematic dance that works towards its final crescendo and leaves you breathless. What Fallout celebrates is the art of the stunt work at its most visceral best because the more reckless the stunt, the more you believe it.  What Fallout brings to the table is an action authenticity where you feel every brutal punch and every thrilling chase knowing you’ve gone through an experience.  Despite Hunt appearing to have dabbed into the dark arts for an invincibility spell, you steadily sense his vulnerability and desperation, pushed further into the insanity of the stunt. If anything, Mission Impossible has become a living testament and commitment in its constant search for new stylish ways to integrate stunt and story.  Fallout represents the best accumulation of that.  Like the ethos of silent cinema and its incredible stunts, the relentless action is constantly pulling you and its characters out of their comfort zone. Another Mission Impossible film is all but guaranteed.  As one chapter closes, Fallout opens the door for more possibilities.  No matter how it continues, Tom Cruise and his chase for stunt excellence will be a driving force for the continued brilliance of this franchise.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2020"," Ethan Hunt must deal with a returning terrorist villain, a new group of zealots and an interfering CIA operative in his latest very improbable mission. Being a film critic is the best job in the world – obviously. Sometimes, though, it’s easy to lose sight of that. Sitting through the latest noisy installment in the Transformers franchise, or enduring a comedy that’s about as funny as a Brexit white paper, is enough to make even the most devoted cinephile question their career decisions. Thank goodness, then, for movies like Mission: Impossible – Fallout. It’s a stupid, ridiculous, shlocky romp so enjoyable that it restores every lost iota of faith in cinema to amaze, enthral and excite. Not bad for the sixth film in a fairly generic collection of action movies. For the first time in the 20 year history of the franchise, there’s a returning director at the helm, with Christopher McQuarrie picking up where he left off after the fun but forgettable Rogue Nation back in 2015. Alec Baldwin’s CIA suit is now in charge of the IMF and he has tasked Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) with tracking down a trio of plutonium devices before they fall into the clutches of the Apostles – a group of zealots formed from the ashes of the Syndicate, whose founder Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is ricocheting around between the law enforcement systems of various nations. A calamitous decision made by Hunt in the heat of battle leads to the plutonium vanishing into criminal hands and the interference of CIA assassin Walker (Henry Cavill), who is despatched to keep an eye on Hunt and his IMF team as they try to recover the radioactive material before it can become weaponised. Things are complicated further by the reappearance of former MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own set of missions and loyalties. McQuarrie has woven yet another tapestry of double crosses and conspiracies with Fallout, though it’s clear that this is not where the lion’s share of his enthusiasm lies. This movie’s storyline is little more than a skeleton, on to which McQuarrie and producer-star-daredevil Cruise assemble an elaborate musculature of set pieces that are as inventive as they are dangerous. Whether it’s a bruising bathroom fight, a motorbike chase through the streets of a major European city or an aerial battle in which helicopters become high altitude dodgem cars, McQuarrie and his fearless leading man pull out all the stops to batter the audience into submission. And it’s in this quest that the film whole-heartedly succeeds. There is action in this movie to rival anything in the best genre adventures of recent years, from Mad Max: Fury Road‘s vehicular carnage to the superhero smackdowns of Avengers: Infinity War. The climactic face-off, atop a towering Asian cliff, is a bruising battle of fists that is as cathartically funny as it is stunningly violent. It’s a movie that almost dares the audience to engage in their own daredevil stunt – holding their breath for the entire third act. It helps, too, that this franchise is now fully embracing its ludicrousness like an old friend. There’s a running gag characterising the IMF as “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat” and Simon Pegg’s tech whizz Benji has dialled up the exasperation even further. This new incarnation of Mission: Impossible marks the swaggering confidence of a series that, after decades of tinkering, has found its identity as a cartoonish demolition derby, anchored by its Cruise missile of a star – willing to dangle from, and ultimately jump off, as many tall things as he can find. These movies belong to Cruise, and it’s easy to see why. Undaunted by either his advancing years, or the smashed-up ankle he sustained during filming in London, the 56-year-old man of mayhem is a whirlwind running through almost every frame of the movie’s two and a half hours – a lot on paper, but it flies by – in a constant quest to one-up his own excesses. He’s amply supported by his usual ensemble, but he equally benefits from Henry Cavill, effectively reprising the sneering arrogance of his character in The Man From U.N.C.L.E. in a role that is as enjoyable as anything he has done in his big screen career. McQuarrie’s comfort equally shines through in the visual finesse on show throughout the film. Interior scenes have a retro grain, while the aforementioned finale unfolds against an eclectic climate, changing from snow-capped peaks to the verdant beauty of greenery in the blink of an eye, each captured with an eye for sheer beauty by cinematographer Rob Hardy. The sound design, too, deserves credit for some crunching punches and deafening chases, while Lorne Balfe’s score mixes old and new with a seamless sense of the same kid-in-a-sweet-shop joy that powers the whole movie. It’s not a straight slam dunk, though. Michelle Monaghan, returning as Hunt’s estranged ex-wife, hands the film an entirely unnecessary emotional subplot that never works, despite the best efforts of Ving Rhames in a beefed-up role as hacker Luther. Rhames shines in his comedy moments – including a particularly fraught attempt to defuse a bomb – but struggles to do as much emotional heavy-lifting as the script asks of him. Equally, a British society dirty dealer played by The Crown‘s Vanessa Kirby adds an injection of strange energy when she’s on screen, but ultimately flits in and out of the narrative without much rhyme or reason. These complaints, however, are a mere footnote in the face of the towering achievement that Mission: Impossible – Fallout transpires to be. In a movie world in which even the biggest films often feel as if they are holding plenty back for sequels, it’s a joy to experience a blockbuster bonanza that genuinely feels as if it’s tossing absolutely everything it has at the audience in an attempt to deliver pure, unadulterated escapism. It’s possible for a film critic to lose sight of the joy of cinema, for sure, but after I spent the last 20 minutes of Fallout repeating the words “I bloody love movies” in my head, I’d say I’m in a good place for the moment.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2020","The physical proximity to each character and each movement is so minute, so aurally and visually sweeping, that Fallout is often slick as all hell.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2020"," There is absolutely no doubt as to why Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible is the strongest franchise Hollywood has to offer. In a world where CGI rules the roost, Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie perform their high aerial stunts in the real world. Delivering a thrilling ride proving every mission they undertake is certainly possible whilst not scrimping on its entertainment value. Events escalate no sooner as the picture opens; Ethan (Cruise) and his merry men, Simon Pegg’s Benji and the man-made wall, Luther (played by Ving Rhames) manage to lose three spheres of nuclear material. It proceeds to spend the next two and a half hours trying to get it back and save the world. However, it’s not that simple as the action-packed story weaves through the European streets of London and Paris with a few familiar faces popping up along the way. Whilst Ethan is plagued with guilt and the haunting memories of his wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), Ethan’s boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) returns to continuously butt heads with Angela Bassett’s Erica Sloan. Continuing to think Ethan is moderately a liability; Sloan proceeds to assign the hulking August Walker (Henry Cavill) to accompany Ethan on his hunt to thwart the most recent threat. Each scene hereafter is a bit like me and my shadow between the pair, but there is certainly no love lost between the men as the masculinity fills the air. Even Rebecca Ferguson turns up as Ilsa Faust in the most random of spots. Not just to keep an eye on the situation, but also to give the men a run for their money in the sleek fight sequences as well. She also throws in that unspoken lust connection between Ethan and herself softening the violent edge. Hats off to Cruise, after all these years, his adrenaline junkie side is still pumping strong and taking on 99% of his own stunts. Even his highly publicised ankle break whilst filming a building leap has been left in. It’s just as wince-inducing as when the footage was first published, but just reiterates the man’s professional insanity and desire to carry on. His staple running sequence is one to behold too, one that has become a bit of a running joke. At one point it becomes clear that Cruise is actually auditioning for a role in The Flash. Even though the humour is nevertheless present, it is overshadowed by the jaw-dropping, flawless action set pieces; from watching Cruise sprint through the streets and rooftops of France to the incredible punch-up in the toilets of a club between Cavill, Cruise and the Chinese actor Liang Yang. The fighting is ridiculously relentless as they are punched through walls and slammed into porcelain sinks. Even though the bathroom is destroyed, the men just keep getting up. The winning sequence comes in the gripping dying scenes in Kashmir. Set amongst the glorious mountain setting, as two helicopters manoeuvre between themselves with Cruise dangling from a rope to finally cement his adrenaline lunacy. It’s clear that McQuarrie and Cruise make for an unbeatable combination on this franchise. McQuarrie’s eye for slick, flawless and stunning filmmaking paired with Cruise’s slightly unhinged grip of action fodder has created spectacular, pure unadulterated blockbuster awesomeness.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2020"," The sixth instalment of Mission: Impossible opens with IMF lynchpin Ethan Hunt in the midst of a bad dream. He wakes up with a start. This would be pretty routine stuff but for the fact that the film's protagonist is an unstoppable spy who thrives on performing death-defying stunts without ever worrying about the inherent dangers. The human facet of Tom Cruise's most abiding screen persona separates this action hero from most others. Mission: Impossible - Fallout isn't only about the lead actor jumping of airplanes and skyscrapers, hanging from cliffs, and even flying a helicopter when he doesn't how to. The screenplay gives the star and his co-actors, whether they are playing his foes or friends, substantial character arcs. The title has meaning that goes beyond just this episode - it links Hunt's actions and decisions from earlier Mission: Impossible entries, including his marriage with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his decision to temporarily quit the Mission Impossible Force, and his battle of wits with the villain of the very first film of the franchise. But thanks to Cruise, the star who has flamboyantly anchored the Mission: Impossible franchise since it kicked off the under the supervision of Brian De Palma in 1996, Fallout works as a film even if one were to ignore what has gone before. The central character wastes no time in swinging into action and plunging into situations that once again test his physical tenacity, courage and luck. The film itself is a breeze, as smooth a ride as any Hollywood action film of recent times. It gallops full throttle but allows occasional breathing spaces that serve the purpose of setting the stage for the big moments. It is not as if Mission: Impossible - Fallout does anything that is remotely off the beaten track. But even as it stays firmly within the parameters of the game as it has been played in the previous five films of the TV series-inspired franchise, it manages to create an air of creative freshness and excitement. Christopher McQuarrie, the only director to return for a second Mission: Impossible film, clearly has a way with action set pieces. The manner in which he spaces out the thrills demonstrates perfect judgment and the way he imparts urgency and pace to these scenes suggest a special flair for blockbuster action interspersed with intriguing reveals and red herrings. Fallout opens a couple of years adrift of the events of McQuarrie's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015). British secret agent-turned-anarchist Solomon Lane is still in custody since being captured by Hunt. However, the Syndicate formed by the criminal mastermind remains as active as ever. The more intransigent and impatient elements within the outfit have now spun themselves off into a more dangerous group called The Apostles and are plotting the acquisition of nuclear devices powerful enough to flatten the whole world. The Apostles, the audience is told early on through an unusual CNN newscast, plan to target the holiest places of the three Abrahamic religions - the Vatican, Mecca and Jerusalem. For Hunt and his trusted aides, field operative Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and tech-whiz Luther Stickwell (Ving Rhames), it is another race against time to save humanity from annihilation. In Hunt's lexicon, 'humanity' of course pertains as much 'individuals' as to all of mankind. So, he thinks nothing of letting the three plutonium cores slip out of his grasp in an early sequence so as to ensure that one of his mates does not lose his life. This act of generosity is held against him and the CIA chief Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) deploys her sharpest assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt as he pursues the dangerous Lane and his associates. Sloane taunts the IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin): ""You use the scalpel, I prefer the hammer."" But nothing that Hunt indulges in from here on evokes scalpel strokes. He is into sledgehammer blows, which fit in pretty neatly with the film's sweep and ambition. Besides his ex-wife Julia, a medic he encounters in Turtuk, Leh, Hunt's path cross those of the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who makes him a deal that he grabs with both hands, and his former ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), MI6 agent who is, for mysterious reasons, after the very objects that Hunt is hunting for. Fallout settles into a loopy rhythm that sucks the audience instantly into its orbit. The narrative scampers from one thing to another without running into complications and hindrances that could undermine the visceral hold the film establishes over the viewer. But it is also a rare action film that assumes a somewhat political skew - it talks about destroying the existing world order and starting afresh. From great suffering from come peace, says the arch-villain. Greater the suffering, greater the peace. The methods he proposes to use for achieving that end entails a huge deal of violence. Ethan Hunt, like James Bond but in ways that are diametrically different, is willing to go to any length to see that humanity triumphs. The intertwining of the political and the moral itself makes Fallout an action thriller of a completely unique timbre. The fact that it also delivers a vibrant, globe-straddling plot high points, these constitute the crux, makes it all the more exhilarating.",POSITIVE

"Jul 1, 2020"," I walked out of Mission: Impossible—Fallout (2018) still trying to catch my breath from the 147 minutes of near-relentless action. After an afternoon of thought, I had a review outlined in my head, ready to write up the next day. And then, while I slept the sleep of the just, Brian Tallerico went ahead and published a review that says most of what I wanted to say, but much, much better. In sum, this film is elevated action. Believe the hype—all of it. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie doesn’t mess around; we come to action films for action, and McQuarrie doesn’t subordinate the other filmic elements to the action, he carefully molds the action to incorporate other elements into a flowing, organic whole: character, theme, location (that shot of the Arc de Triomphe!). The fight scenes are shot and edited to achieve complete viewer-identification with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), especially one scene that comes off as a quieter, more coherent, and more exciting version of the casino fight scene in Black Panther (2018). There’re also a couple of callbacks to the Henry Cavill of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) during the Paris chase sequence. Speaking of the Paris chase sequence, did you know that the Cruise of every shot in the foot chase had an ankle that had yet to fully heal? You can read about that, the 106 HALO jumps, and a truckload of other insanity in this piece about the stunts. Having said all that, I was surprised to find good acting (see this penetrating piece by David Ehrlich) and a ludicrously complex but logical and thematically resonant plot. The film is about Hunt trying to make up for a failed mission and having to choose the lesser of two evils at every turn. He tries to make good choices, but everything just keeps biting him in the ass. The refrain of the film, “We’re working on it [a plan],” alludes to Hunt’s greatest strength and weakness: relying on skill and resources over forethought. The film portrays itself as a conflict between saving the many (Angela Bassett’s CIA Director Erica Sloane) and saving the near (Alec Baldwin’s IMF Secretary Alan Hunley), but the more accurate conflict is between chess and D&D. In the end, the film (barely) agrees with Helmuth von Moltke: “No battle plan survives contact with the enemy.”",POSITIVE

"Jun 20, 2020"," Tom Cruise is 56 years old, and I choose to believe he could keep making Mission: Impossible movies for the rest of his life. (Or Jack Reacher films or maybe even a sequel to Edge of Tomorrow; I don’t know what the physical requirements are for his upcoming Top Gun sequel.) But the truth is I’m not sure how many films like this he’s got left in him. So it seems imperative that we celebrate the Cruise-ian style of action movie while we can, in which he handles most of the death-defying stunts himself; where special effects are only really used to erase the devices that keep Cruise safe from harm or worse; and where the option of not accepting a mission is offered but never taken. With the new Mission: Impossible entry, Fallout, Cruise and returning writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Jack Reacher) seem to have something to prove, both in terms of action and story, which manages to weave in elements and characters from most of the other films and align them in a fairly rich and satisfying manner. This combined with an impressive amount of chases, explosions, gunplay, and aerial antics (made all the more impressive when you see the film in IMAX, since some of the more terrifying sequences were shot in the format) make Fallout something genuinely great. Digging into the details of the specific missions seems pointless, since they’re primarily used as an excuse to light a fuse to some of the finest stunt scenes I’ve ever witnessed. The nature and purpose of the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) was always curious to me. They are a pseudo-government agency that isn’t about intelligence gathering; they are simply brought into a situation to carry out missions, without much regard for political consequences or even any opinions about what events their actions might trigger. They are tasked with protecting the United States (and sometimes the rest of the world, but only by means of collateral aid).  This time around, the threat comes from the existence of three nuclear cores stolen from Russia that could easily be turned into bombs. The intrigue and caper levels in Fallout seem the closest the series has gotten to turning Cruise's Ethan Hunt into the American version of James Bond, minus the misogyny, and I particularly like those aspects of the movie. This is also the closest thing to a direct sequel the franchise has produced, so the IMF is still dealing with the consequences of the events in Rogue Nation and its primary villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the anarchist who is still in captivity but very much in control of certain aspects of this nuclear threat. Also returning is Hunt’s MI6 partner from the previous film, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who returns after supposedly leaving the agency to kill Lane for reasons unknown, even if she has to shoot through Hunt to make it happen. Hunt’s reliable partners (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, who gets a lot more time the field in this go-round), as well as his boss (Alec Baldwin) are also on hand. And after the IMF’s first attempt at retrieving the nuclear elements goes wrong, the CIA steps in, led by Erica Slone (Angela Bassett), who places a monster of an agent, August Walker (Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill, really getting to show off what a badass he can be). The only one of the new characters I could never quite figure out was a courier called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), whose character traits are limited to wanting to have sex with Hunt and having access to those nukes. Without giving anything away, Fallout also finds a way of dealing with the one major loose end in Hunt’s life, his now ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan, who is way too good an actor to be sidelined the way she has been in this series), who has chosen to let go of the man she loves because she’s too much of a distraction to him, as the world needs Hunt as perhaps its most capable protector. It’s a fascinating, even bizarre conceit, but in the context of these films, it’s also difficult to argue with her logic. The way Julia is incorporated fully into the final act of the film is kind of genius and fitting, and the way she basically passes the romance torch to Ilsa (should she choose to accept it) is rather sweet. Every single aspect of Fallout works, from the sound design (again, in a proper IMAX setting, your mind will be fried) and the camerawork to the emotional component, which often feels as risky as the stunt sequences. Speaking of which, if your heart (perhaps accompanying a portion of your lunch) doesn’t shoot up out of your throat at a specific moment during a scene where Cruise dangles under a helicopter by a rope, then you are not built like a human.  The stakes seem very much of this world, for better or worse, and as a result, maybe we need an unflinching hero like Ethan Hunt in our corner. In this movie, it is revealed that the IMF is quietly laughed out in certain circles of the intelligence community as a group of idiots running around in Halloween masks (and given a sequence near the beginning involving none other than Wolf Blitzer, maybe the reputation is justified), so Fallout is a film in which the group has something to prove.  Perhaps for that reason, the film feels tougher and less polished in all the right ways while simultaneously being bigger and more sweeping than ever before. It’s the best of what the Mission: Impossible franchise has to offer, and I hope Cruise and company still have one or two left in them. Maybe sunsetting the Ethan Hunt character could be his retirement present when he hits 65 or so. Just a thought. Steve Prokopy is chief film critic for the Chicago-based arts outlet

"Nov 11, 2019"," It is strange to think that this film franchise, a reboot of a 1960s TV series starring Martin Landau and Barbara Bach, is 22 years old this year. However, after five films and a global gross of more than $2.6bn, Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in the latest instalment of the Mission: Impossible franchise with  Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation‘s Christopher McQuarrie back in the director’s chair. Mission: Impossible – Fallout sees Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team try and prevent a nuclear threat from escapee Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) while being under the watchful eye of CIA agent Walker (Henry Cavill). What McQuarrie does in this sixth instalment is to integrate a comfort zone – with Pegg, Ferguson and Rhames back as Hunt’s associates, there is a familiarity and camaraderie that highlight the fact that his professional attachments are now stemming into the personal. In a way, it reminds audiences that IMF is more than a job to Hunt – it is his family. Given the traumatic events in the first film all those years ago, we finally see the emotional effects the job has on Hunt and the importance of what he has turned his back on – a normal life. At 56 years old, Cruise shows he has the strength to take on such a physical role. Taking on more death-defying stunts that easily surpass the previous MI films, including one that caused a notable foot injury, he reminds audiences why he is one of Hollywood’s leading men. Although the new boy in the franchise, Cavill is great as CIA agent Walker, whose physicality and detached demeanour makes a perfect foil for Hunt. Pegg and Rhames provide the occasional comic relief, while Ferguson and Kirby deliver cool and collected performances. Even though this is his fourth feature film, Fallout shows McQuarrie’s confidence as a filmmaker. Despite the occasional uneven pacing, he incorporates plenty of twists and turns that allow the recent Syndicate narrative to come full circle. In addition, Rob Hardy’s stunning cinematography makes each scene incredibly sharp. Combined with exciting sequences such as adrenaline-fuelled motorcycle chases to one of the best bathroom fights in recent cinema, Fallout is easily one of the most thrilling action films this year. Easily exceeding its predecessors in terms of action, story, visuals and direction, Mission: Impossible – Fallout shows that there is still life in the franchise and with McQuarrie at the helm, the future looks bright.",POSITIVE

What started in 1996 as a film adaptation of a late 1960s TV series gradually turned into one of the highest grossing film franchises of all time. As one who tends to avoid the violence and glamour of action spy films, I chose to sit out the M:I series for most of my life. I didn’t expect too much upon seeing Mission: Impossible – Fallout. To an extent, I got what I asked for. There’s explosions, gunshots, and literal cliffhangers, but with solid characters and a good story, the film left me constantly guessing where the plot would go next. Tom Cruise returns in the sixth installment of the “M:I” series as Ethan Hunt, an agent with the “Impossible Missions Force” who’s tasked with saving the world from nuclear-armed terrorists. Like Jason Bourne or Jack Ryan, he’s another American answer to James Bond. At the same time, Hunt is clearly weathered from years of the same old mission. Where he once tried to settle down and have a normal life, we learn that his absence from the world scene has made it a more dangerous place. His latest mission involves the recovery of three plutonium cores which have fallen into the hands of the international terror group, known as the “Syndicate.” Once his mission becomes compromised, he is forced to make a decision between rescuing his colleague, Luther Stickell (played by the ever-wonderful Ving Rhames) and accomplishing the mission. He chooses the former, rescuing his friend, and winds up losing the plutonium cores. While his colleague lives to see another day, Hunt’s decision results in the plutonium falling further and further into the wrong hands. As he begins his quest to find the plutonium, old friends and foes emerge from Hunt’s past, forcing him to decide which is more important – the fate of his loved ones or the fate of the world. The story almost has a Goldeneye feel to it. The protagonist is a borderline rogue agent willing to bend the rules in order to accomplish the mission. Unlike Bond, though, Hunt has more humanity in that he’s willing to put the lives of others before the success of a mission. Cruise gives a solid performance as the personally compromised Ethan Hunt. I never once lost interest in him and was able to bond with the character from the start.  The remaining ensemble give stellar performances as well. Usually, apart from the protagonist, we have plenty of throw-away characters replete with one-liners and slapstick gags in vain attempts to provide comic relief, often failing. We don’t get that with this one. They pop up every now and then, but only when necessary. Every actor does his or her part with their given character, who have their own strengths and weaknesses in the story. Plus, the film also stars Angela Bassett – always one to give your film an extra IQ point. Granted, M:I – Fallout does have its weaknesses, the run-time (2 hours and 28 minutes) serving up the biggest one. While we have a compelling plot with thrilling moments, it does tend to drag towards the end. We’re all on the edge of our seats, which is fine, but when the climax keeps going and going, the suspense tends to dull the senses. But hey, at least the movie kept me in my seat until the credits (unlike, say, Valerian), and I don’t mind being stuck on a rollercoaster, so long as I know the cars are moving closer to the edge. Is this the best action film in the world? No. Is it the best in the M:I series? Probably, probably not. I’ll let the fans decide on that one. For me, it gets a passing grade. It could have been chopped down by 20-minutes, but even then, it never loses its audience – and that’s what you must shoot for when telling a story.

"Oct 17, 2019"," It would seem impossible, but the “Mission: Impossible” film franchise keeps getting better and better. For 22 years now, Paramount Pictures has produced one excellent action film after another in this series, and the latest entry may be their best actioner yet. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” delivers the most thrills, the highest level of tension, and the greatest number of “How the hell did they do that?” action sequences of any of the “M: I” films so far. As if that’s not miraculous enough, its leading man is the 56-year-old Tom Cruise and he’s still giving this series his absolute all. He runs, jumps, hangs from the rafters and performs one amazing stunt after another. Impossible? Incredible. In this outing, Cruise’s spy character Ethan Hunt spearheads one of the Impossible Mission Force’s most dangerous assignments. A terrorist organization called “The Apostles” is threatening nuclear proliferation if their anarchist leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is not released pronto. The Apostles will return the three stolen plutonium warhead cores they’ve stolen upon his safe return. Hunt’s team, including venerable supporting players Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), arrange a go-between to get their hands on the warhead cores first, but they’re double-crossed at the exchange by an unknown player. The nukes are now loose while IMF team licks their wounds, and that inspires CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to send in one of her own to chaperone the IMF team’s rescue mission. Hunt doesn’t like being babysat, especially from a macho thug like CIA agent Walker (Henry Cavill, in that serious mustache you’ve heard so much about.) The two Alpha Males don’t trust each other, and their conflict makes for truly delicious tension in every single scene they have together. Nonetheless, they must find a way to bond for the sake of the mission, and soon Hunt is posing as an arms dealer to sidle up to a black marketer named White Widow with Walker in tow. The Widow is played with coy charisma by Vanessa Kirby from “The Crown” and she still has her regal bearings even though she’s playing a crook here. Adding further complications to the rescue mission are the plethora of thugs that the White Widow employs, and they don’t trust Hunt et al. either. Making a perfect storm is the inclusion of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), their MI-6 counterpart from the last movie. She shows up with a vendetta against terrorist Lane and Hunt doesn’t know if she can be trusted. Is she on the allies’ side or has she gone rogue? What’s Walker’s real role in the mission? And what angle is Alec Baldwin’s Hunley playing, especially since he was CIA in the last film before taking over the IMF? All these untrustworthy characters trying to work together makes for exciting, tense, and drolly funny interplay. This outing is almost as entertaining while they’re all standing around arguing as it is when they are running around and saving the world. However, the set pieces are truly a cut above the quality one finds even in this fantastic franchise. In fact, in set piece after exciting set piece, audiences will be blown away by how adroitly conceived and choreographed they all are. They’re complex, take place in busy locations, and deliver maximum thrills throughout.  A fist fight in a nightclub bathroom turns into a bare-knuckled brawl that would make John Wick envious. A rooftop chase turns into a thrilling obstacle course for Hunt, rendered all the more impressive by its use of London locales and Cruise’s acrobatic leaps and bounds. And an extended car chase through the streets of Paris is as amazing for all its different twists and turns on the streets as it is in the cat and mouse plotting with players turning against each other on a dime. (I’m sorry, Franc.) Yet, the best is saved for the last 30 minutes when McQuarrie literally employs a ticking clock and sets up an actual cliffhanger for his story’s climax. Again, most of what we’re watching onscreen occurs in real locations, not in make-believe green screens filmed in a contained studio. This all looks incredibly real, and most of it definitely is. That includes Cruise doing things like climbing up a rope hundreds of feet above the ground to hijack a flying helicopter. Granted, he’s probably supported by wires that have been taken out in post, but he’s still hovering way above the landscape. Few stars would ever endeavor to do something so dangerous, but it makes this franchise all the more fun because its leading man relishes such challenges. In a summer that has seen too many sequels already, this one stands out from the crowd as its crown jewel. We may be six films in, but if they’re going to be as continually terrific as this, the action franchise should go on and on, even without the aging Cruise in the lead. That probably won’t be any time soon though, especially if he can still show the moves he demonstrates so ably in this one. There’s no slowing him down, or this superior franchise, for that matter.  Jeff York has been writing film criticism online since 2011.

"Sep 2, 2019"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout had the best opening weekend of the entire series with $61.2 million (and another $94.6 million overseas). This is the film Tom Cruise broke his ankle on and the film Henry Cavill just had to have a mustache for that made those re-shoots for Justice League have such disastrous results. The sequel has a whopping 97% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 Metascore on Metacritic. Critics and the general movie-going audience emphatically and enthusiastically adore this film and personally it doesn’t register why the Mission: Impossible franchise is so cherished by movie lovers. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, Sean Harris as villain Solomon Lane, and Rebecca Ferguson as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust all return from Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation; this is the first film where a director and a villain have returned from a previous film. The technical aspects of the film are the easiest to admire and the action sequences are outstandingly breathtaking. The big action sequences include the parachute/free fall sequence with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and August Walker (Henry Cavill), the bathroom brawl with Hunt, Walker, and John Lark, Hunt’s motorcycle chase, Hunt running and jumping across rooftops, and the insane helicopter chase. It’s ridiculous (in a good way) how much room cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation, Ex Machina) gives each sequence; these are scenes made for seeing and experiencing in IMAX. You can tell that the majority of the stunts were pulled off practically and green screens and computer generated effects are utilized minimally. The most impressive sequence is the motorcycle chase because Tom Cruise races through the wrong side of traffic without a helmet in the circle around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. But the helicopter chase features Cruise climbing up a rope dangling in the air while the helicopter is airborne. These sequences are extremely open with perspectives that not only make you feel like you’re with Tom Cruise being just as nuts and exhilarating as he is, but also seem to be making the statement that Cruise is still crazy enough to do the majority of his own stunts at the age of 56 despite his saggy jowls. Many on social media were claiming that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is nonstop action over its nearly 150-minute runtime, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The film seems to be attempting this never ending adrenaline rush found within the likes of films like Mad Max: Fury Road and Speed, but it fails to do so. The action is superb, but everything in between is extraordinarily dull. Missing the first and third films in the franchise may have contributed to that, but there’s not much to miss here if you haven’t seen the other films in the franchise. Hunt obviously still cares about his ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), but currently has a connection with Ilsa Faust. The spy element of the sequel feels so cliché and predictable as every twist and big reveal can easily be predicted even if this is your first Mission: Impossible film. The inclusion of a bomb in a Mission: Impossible film feels explosively juvenile at this point and you legitimately have no investment in these characters whatsoever. With every Mission: Impossible film that’s released, it seems like its main purpose is for Tom Cruise to be like Mad TV’s Stuart and yell, “Look what I can do!” before partaking in extracurricular activities a man in his fifties should probably be distancing himself from. To be fair, Cruise is still more than capable of doing incredible action films and is generally a part of films that aim to be exciting for everyone. Fallout is extraordinary if you scrutinize without any sort of context. The film knows how to make your pulse race and your palms sweat as you gasp for breath. But the story is the same as any other Mission: Impossible film and the sequel is basically dead as far as any sort of emotional acting goes. There’s no substance here and impressive action doesn’t make up for a defused storyline.",NEUTRAL

"Aug 22, 2019"," With below-average CGI-fests continuously racking in box office cash, authenticity – or at least the allusion of authenticity – has taken the make or break role obviously not in what makes an action movie rich, but what makes an action movie great.  If you have seen what I consider to be the genre’s last two great films, Mad Max: Fury Road and last year’s Baby Driver, the distinctions between these pulse-pounding adventures and sluggish productions like Rampage and Skyscraper (sorry Dwayne Johnson) are clear.  There is no barefooted Bruce Willis here in Mission: Impossible – Fallout to put us right there in the action.  Better yet, there is Tom Cruise, whose tireless stamina – and yes, there is a lot of running – ensures the pulse-pounding and the adventure.  Christopher McQuarrie’s latest mission is an action film of the highest caliber, surely the best of the year. The M:I franchise continues to be the exception to the sequel curse, somehow getting better and better with every installment.  Since 1996, probably the only constant in each film is that million-dollar money shot: that everything-hangs-in-the-balance moment featuring Cruise facing real danger for our chair-clutching pleasure.  It started off small with the now infamous scene of the Top Gun actor hanging inches above a sea of sensors.  But then it grew…and grew…and grew.  In 2011’s Ghost Protocol, we saw Cruise climb up the tallest building in the world.  Then in 2015’s Rogue Nation, I watched between my fingers as Cruise held onto the side of a cargo plane as it took off.  In Fallout, there are like six of these scenes, and having just celebrated his 56th birthday, Cruise proves that he is still Hollywood’s hungriest, if not craziest, star. For the first time in the series, a new Mission is led by a returning director; McQuarrie, who headed and wrote Rogue Nation, brings the franchise its most sequel-like sequel, stripping Ethan Hunt (Cruise) of the clean slate that has prevented us from really learning anything about him.  We are finally allowed passage into the little bit of life Hunt allows himself to have – learning the cause of his purposely limited personal life, audiences may even find a new respect for the character.  Hunt is no Bond, but this is his Skyfall. McQuarrie wastes no time establishing the tone of the film, which will prove to contain not only action, but stakes as well, something that is rare for a franchise, let alone the sixth part of one.  We are brought in as Hunt, Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) attempt to intercept a briefcase containing three orbs of plutonium from The Apostles, a terrorist group made up of the remnants of The Syndicate, the terrorist organization featured in the last film.  The Apostles, working for the bid of the mysterious John Lark, seek chaos; they all believe that suffering precedes progression. With three nuclear warheads, there’s potential for a lot of progression, a fact made even scarier once Hunt botches the transaction and loses sight of the briefcase. Now, the IMF team must scramble to get the plutonium before Lark gets to it, but not without a little – not to mention condescending – help.  CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), who has never been too patient with the IMF’s methods, is not happy by the events which caused the last mission to fail, so she sends one of her own agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill, with a moustache), to oversee the operation and ensure, by any means necessary, its success. There is an underlying tension throughout Fallout which asks how much people should have to give up for the greater good.  The idea is that Hunt is too protective of those he cares about, while Walker cares about no one; the onscreen dynamic between Cruise and Cavill is tantalizing.  There are so many tough decisions to be made here, especially once the disgusting villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is thrown into the mix, and the film does an excellent job bouncing between the strengths and flaws of each man’s approach to saving the world.  Sure, it is obvious who makes the better spy in the movie world – that’s why he has six movies – but it is fun to think about who you would want there to cut the wire if this was all for real. Hunt and Walker are sent into Paris, and from there, things get very deadly.  And it doesn’t stop.  Action films too often slow down as if to catch their breath between what I will call “checkpoints:” the big parts, the loud parts, those sorts of things.  The Mission: Impossible films as a whole have always been better about this, but Fallout, at an epic 150 minutes, is the best of them all.  Not only are there more of these checkpoints in this film, but they are bigger, more epic, and strung together in a way that not only makes sense to the plot – yes, there’s a plot, and it’s a pretty good one too – but also makes the film possible to enjoy without the plot. While Fallout is still very much dependent on Cruise’s almost nonsensical stunt work, and an action film people will not be going into see for the performances, the ensemble work here is superb.  Veterans Rhames and Pegg still do their part blissfully and even Alec Baldwin, the new secretary for the IMF, runs out on the field for some fun.  Rebecca Ferguson, who played a vital role in Rogue Nation, returns with a rival sideline story with some intensity of its own and totally takes command of the screen. But at the end of the day, the celebrations and accolades must go to the star and producer Cruise, who may be the most in-shape person in the world over the age of 50.  As a franchise, Mission: Impossible has always stood on its own in the action genre because while other films are forced to find ways to create the perception of danger, this one has a star who takes the risks, the risks that, until someone gets really hurt, create an experience unlike any other.",POSITIVE
"Aug 14, 2019","It all seems so impossible, but Cruise is impressive and so is this film. It's exhausting as much as it is smart and entertaining.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2019"," Over the course of six movies, Mission: Impossible has basically turned into the franchise where Tom Cruise does crazy stunts. Fallout, the newest entry, is no exception—and I’d have it no other way. Christopher McQuarrie—he wrote and directed this film as well as its predecessor Rogue Nation—seems to have cracked the code to this long-running franchise. In Fallout, the story is negligible. There’s enough plot to keep the momentum and the twists keep it engaging. McQuarrie seems to be the perfect match to star Tom Cruise‘s unique take on action. The difference between the action in this movie and the action in the equally audacious Fast & Furious franchise is that in Fallout, McQuarrie captures the action in a clean and economical way. It’s the reason Mad Max: Fury Road was so successful. Every action set piece has a narrative pulse whether it be a two on one brawl in a bathroom or an epic car chase through the streets of Paris or a HALO jump from an airplane—the best scene in the film and possibly of the year. In Fallout, we begin, as always, with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) receiving his mission, should he choose to accept it. He is tasked with retrieving three plutonium cores that can be easily turned into nuclear bombs that can reek destruction on any city that the holder chooses. In this case, the holder is a group dubbed “The Apostles,” a terrorist organization born out of the remains of “The Syndicate.” Refreshingly, that main plot, which is set up breezily in the cold open—it features an amusing cameo by Wolf Blitzer—is the goal for the entire film. Unlike the Bond films or Bourne films which have twisting plots that end up somewhere different than where they started, Fallout stays focused. “The Apostles” want to use the bombs to create a new world order by inflicting the maximum pain on the planet. As they say, “the greater the pain, the greater the peace.” Ethan’s search—he’s aided by a skeleton crew consisting of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (the consummate steady hand Ving Rhames)—leads him to Paris where an arms dealer known as White Widow (Vanessa Kirby is a clear standout in the role) is allegedly selling the cores to a man called John Lark, who wants to carry out “The Apostles'” agenda. However, before going to Paris, CIA director Erica Sloane (a deliciously headstrong Angela Bassett) forces Ethan to take along August Walker (Henry Cavill sporting the infamous mustache) as a failsafe. From there, Fallout puts out some of the most impressive and thrilling action sequences ever committed to film. However, every action set piece has a purpose. The HALO jump adeptly sets up Hunt’s moral center and juxtaposes against Wilson’s more brash tactics. The scene, which is devoid of composer Lorne Balfe’s (The Florida Project) impressive score, is breathtaking. McQuarrie gives every moment and action weight. As the pair tumble towards the Earth, you feel the stakes of what is happening, even if you know everything is going to come out fine. Every set piece is infused with those stakes. At one point, an armored truck carrying former leader of “The Syndicate” Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is rammed into a river. Instead of the truck slowly filling with water, which would throw off the rhythm of the scene, an intense and literal wall of water swallows Lane. The camera is attached to the truck to give the illusion that the water, not the truck is rotating. It’s that kind of innovative filmmaking that makes Fallout a bold practice in the action movie genre. Tom Cruise is infamous for concocting crazier and crazier stunts that he performs himself. While it seemed like a publicity ploy, Mission: Impossible — Fallout makes it clear why he’s been indispensable until now. His screen presence is irreplaceable specifically when he is performing action. Now that he’s found a director that knows how to capture them, the Mission: Impossible franchise has found new life. Don’t let us down Ethan. That is your mission, should you choose to accept it. Hey, I'm Karl, founder and film critic at Smash Cut.

"Jul 13, 2019"," A lo largo de los 22 años que han pasado desde que Brian de Palma estrenase la primera y maravillosa 'Misión: Imposible', la que sin duda es una de las mejores y más sólidas sagas cinematográficas de la historia ha evolucionado muy positivamente a través de unas secuelas que han exprimido todo el potencial del material base; rizando el rizo hasta un punto en el que parece no haber cabida para la innovación o nuevas vueltas de tuerca. Bajo este poco halagüeño panorama, Christopher McQuarrie se ha puesto de nuevo tras las cámaras al frente de la franquicia tras la notable 'Nación secreta' haciendo lo único que podía hacer para mantener viva —y de qué manera— la llama: subir las apuestas existentes a un nuevo nivel tomando como base un acertado ""cuanto más grande, mejor"". Una premisa que ha dado como resultado una descomunal y electrizante 'Misión: Imposible - Fallout' que se eleva como el mejor blockbuster de la temporada y una de las mejores cintas de acción de los últimos tiempos. 'Misión: Imposible - Fallout' da forma a lo largo de sus fugaces dos horas y media de metraje a la mejor entrega de la serie desde que se estrenase la cinta original en 1996. Un logro que consigue, en parte, gracias su magnífico equilibrio tonal y narrativo y, por encima de todo, al respetar a pies juntillas las señas de identidad que han hecho grandes las aventuras de Ethan Hunt y compañía, aportando un plus de espectacularidad a la fórmula preestablecida.  Una de estas marcas de la casa radica, como no podría ser de otro modo, en sus espléndidas set pieces. Unas escenas de acción que siempre han mantenido índices de calidad abrumadores, casi impensables, y que en 'Fallout' tocan techo en una frenética orgía de caos, muerte y destrucción que bien merece sus comparativas con 'Mad Max: Furia en la carretera' —aún imbatible en su terreno— por lo artesanal y preciso del inigualable show que brinda al patio de butacas. De este modo, Christopher McQuarrie hace una exhibición de músculo y dominio del lenguaje cinematográfico envidiables; sucediendo en la pantalla tiroteos, peleas cuerpo a cuerpo, persecuciones sobre cuatro y dos ruedas —antológica la secuencia de conducción en París, capaz de sonrojar a la mismísima 'Ronin'— e incluso aéreas con un ritmo óptimo e incansable. Algo que se traduce en un visionado marcado por las mandíbulas desencajadas durante el que es harto complicado reprimir gestos de estupefacción y risas nerviosas fruto del asombro. La otra gran clave que hace de 'Fallout' un blockbuster ejemplar —por no decir soñado— es su igualmente notable guión, escrito por el propio McQuarrie y poseedor de todo el espíritu que sentó cátedra en el filme de De Palma con su enrevesada trama de espionaje heredada por sus cinco sucesoras. Un auténtico festival del giro con dobles juegos, topos, sorpresas y un argumento demencial, excesivamente retorcido pero plenamente satisfactorio, que cohesiona elementos de anteriores entregas con inteligencia.  Pero más allá del aluvión de plot-twists —hay escenas en los que se suceden a pares, para deleite del respetable—, es muy de agradecer el mimo con el que el libreto trata a sus arquetípicos personajes; especialmente a la figura de Ethan Hunt. McQuarrie dota de cierta profundidad al espía, indagando en los rincones más oscuros de su psique, en los entresijos de su duro oficio y en los efectos que este tiene sobre su día a día y sus relaciones personales. Si el abanico de protagonistas y secundarios brilla sobre el papel, estos destacan de igual modo personificados por un reparto entregado al cien por cien a la causa. Mientras los nuevos fichajes cumplen con creces su función —mención especial para un Henry Cavill que exuda carisma—, los veteranos, con sus papeles completamente interiorizados, se muestran en su salsa; destacando como es obvio un Tom Cruise que se gana cada centavo de su salario como el mejor efecto especial que podría contratarse en una producción de este corte.  Lejos de mostrar los claros signos de agotamiento que otras sagas cinematográficas dejan entrever tras, en algunos casos, un par de secuelas, 'Misión: Imposible' no sólo continúa en plena forma, sino que mantiene su racha ascendente en términos de calidad y diversión gracias a una 'Fallout' sencillamente ejemplar. De seguir con esta tónica, sólo queda esperar que la mecha la mecha que alimenta la franquicia no se apague en mucho, mucho tiempo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2019"," Dejando aparte 'Misión: Imposible 2', la franquicia protagonizada por Tom Cruise e inspirada en la clásica serie de televisión de espionaje de los sesenta tiene una excelente fama. Las demás entregas (incluida la aclamada última parte) están consideradas piezas más o menos clave del blockbuster moderno: precisas, impecablemente realizadas, con sus gotas de autoría y además, capaces de transmitir la idea de una identidad común, y que con cada nueva entrega se consigue forzar la máquina de su narrativa en inesperadas y excitantes direcciones. Sin embargo, y pese a que es quizás la pieza más irregular del implacable engranaje de la franquicia, ''Misión: Imposible 2' es una película arrebatadora, de un romanticismo ingenuo y tremendo y cuyo gran problema, quizás, es que no encaja con el resto de la serie. Como si la idea vectora de los dos primeros episodios hubiera consistido en un concepto de ""Películas completamente independientes entre sí y con un marcado sello autoral"", y luego esa idea se hubiera desechado en favor de un estilo más homogéneo. Porque lo que es indiscutible de 'Misión: Imposible 2' es que estamos ante una obra de autor: se le podrán echar en cara muchas cosas, pero desde luego está claro que es una película de John Woo, en parte temáticamente -en ese aspecto estaba más atado de manos, claro-, pero desde luego, sin duda, estéticamente. Desde tics específicos -los disparos a dos manos, las palomas- hasta la apabullante planificación o el enfrentamiento final, que parece directamente salido de una película oriental de acción de los ochenta. Lo que posiblemente distancia de 'Misión: Imposible 2' a buena parte del público potencial es su abierta concepción de la trama de espionaje y sus tópicos (el robo, el romance, la némesis, los engaños, las traiciones) como un melodrama, y por tanto, como una ficción en la que todo está fuera de sí. Eso implica personajes esquemáticos, pasiones inflamadas hasta la caricatura, guiños filogays que no vienen a cuento, renuncia a cualquier tipo de realismo... y también acción operística, colorista, hipercoreografiada y enloquecida. Sin embargo, no es como si no supiéramos a lo que veníamos: John Woo llevaba desde mediados de los ochenta rubricando películas muy similares en Hong Kong. La sofisticación argumental de 'The Killer' o 'Una bala en la cabeza' no se repite aquí, pero los romances propios de culebrón y las frases salidas de una fotonovela casposa eran previsibles: Woo siempre ha sido, con más o menos medios a su disposición, un devoto del romanticismo de andar por casa.  Lo que sí podemos, sin duda, es establecer una clara progresión en la trilogía de películas imprescindibles de Woo en Estados Unidos 'Blanco humano' (20 millones de dólares de presupuesto), 'Cara a cara' (80) y esta (125): cuanto más dinero a su disposición, más descontroladas e irregulares son sus películas. De la concisión y contundencia absoluta de 'Blanco humano', una de sus obras capitales, pasamos a la memorable epopeya protagonizada por Cage y Travolta, ya con notorios altibajos de ritmo. Y de ahí a 'M:I 2', una producción plagada de momentos increíbles, pero a la que traiciona su exceso de ambición y medios. Está claro que tiene mucho de Woo pero... ¿qué tiene 'Misión: Imposible 2' de 'Misión: Imposible'? Con las constantes de la franquicia no tan afianzadas como ahora, la película reorienta algo el enfoque de la primera, y plantea una misión para Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) que se tropieza con ciertas dificultades (el amor, cómo no), pero en un contexto que no deja de ser una misión, con su principio y final. En ese sentido, es distinta al resto de la serie, donde el equipo de IMF se ve continuamente abandonado, traicionado, perseguido por los suyos y obligado a operar en la sombra o la clandestinidad. Aquí no: de hecho por momentos la película parece más una entrega de la franquicia Bond que de 'Misión: Imposible'. Hunt está de vacaciones pero se le encarga la misión de recuperar un peligroso virus con la ayuda de una ladrona profesional (Thandie Newton), para impedir que un antiguo agente de la MIF que habitualmente suplantaba a Hunt en diversas misiones (Dougray Scott) comercie con el virus. Es decir, una misión más, que Hunt afronta con su habitual savoir faire, pero más en solitario que de costumbre: quizás es la película de la serie donde el concepto de ""equipo"" es más meramente cosmético. Hunt es un superespía y da la impresión de que puede solventar la situación en solitario. Precisamente por tener un director de fuerte personalidad detrás (quizás la que más en toda la saga, junto al soberbio De Palma de la primera entrega) y por no tener tan establecidas unas marcas argumentales y estéticas que seguir, 'MI:2' es la película más libre de la franquicia. Por ejemplo, coge uno de los iconos de la serie, las máscaras, y las convierte en un delirio sin ninguna credibilidad (¿de dónde salen? ¿Hunt lleva en el bolsillo caretas de todos los secundarios de la película?), pero que encajan perfectamente con ideas sobre la dualidad héroe-villano que Woo había desarrollado en 'Cara a cara' (¡con rostros de quita y pon, como caretas de 'Misión: Imposible'!)... y también en su cine en Hong Kong, con sus argumentos de policías-criminales, asesinos con honor e invidentes que confunden héroes y villanos. Woo lleva esa propuesta hasta el extremo haciendo que en el climax, Hunt y su némesis vistan igual, haciéndolos indistinguibles en la persecución final. Todos estos rasgos de autor no tendrían importancia si no estuviéramos ante una auténtica maravilla visual, rodada y montada con un estilo y una claridad expositiva que deberían ser la norma y no la excepción: esos leves zooms para reencuadrar la acción, esa atención al detalle en las mecánicas de los vehículos (en la persecución de las motos hay planos de ruedas derrapando, manos pulsando frenos, pequeños detalles sobre la conducción que entroncan espiritualmente con el mucho más físico y violento cine de carretera de los setenta). Woo no confunde frenesí con confusión y por eso no hay mejores coreografías en la saga que las suyas de persecuciones automovilísticas. Lo mismo pasa con los tiroteos: la secuencia del atraco está claramente inspirada en el mítico robo de la primera entrega, a veces muy descaradamente, pero es un ejemplo de libro de cómo narrar a través de la acción. Empieza con Hunt intentando robar el virus, pero después de la incursión de los villanos, tiroteos, conversaciones a gritos, decisiones dramáticas y juramentos de amor eterno, los personajes evolucionan, el argumento progresa y la situación de salida es radicalmente distinta a la de entrada. Es decir, todo lo que debería ser una secuencia de ejemplar de este tipo.  Y sí, no vamos a dejar de hablar del elefante en la habitación: la famosa referencia a la cultura española, con Antony Hopkins diciendo que los españoles queman a sus santos, en espectacular cacao conceptual que mezcla Andalucía y fallas valencianas. Dejémoslo en que es lo más parecido a que alguien señale a la luna y nos quedemos mirando el dedo: sería tan ridículo como que los herederos de John Huston tomaran cartas contra nosotros por haber rodado 'Condemor'.  No solo eso, sino que Woo aprovecha los elegantes movimientos del flamenco para rubricar una persecución automovilística con dos coches enzarzándose en un baile que convierte una carretera en un tablao y que es todo arrebatamiento, poesía sobre ruedas y, de nuevo, una lección magistral sobre cómo contar cosas sobre los personajes a base de derrapes, volantazos y acantilados. Así que por lo que a nosotros respecta, esta apropiación cultural queda más que disculpada. Lo curioso de todo ello es constatar que, si nos ponemos estrictos, toda esta pasión culebronera le pasa factura a Woo con un ritmo irregular y una credibilidad bajo mínimos (hay gente que piensa que el resto de la franquicia es cine de espías realista, pero eso ya lo dejamos para otro capítulo). Pero por encima de todo ello hay unas escenas de acción rotundas y extraordinariamente rodadas, con un gusto y una versatilidad que se echa de menos en producciones más bombásticas y taquilleras como las 'Fast & Furious'. Una rareza, en cualquier caso, a la que vale la pena volver ahora que la franquicia se ha convertido en una marca fiable pero sin estridencias.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2019"," ‘Misión: Imposible’ ha sido durante mucho tiempo la única franquicia de Tom Cruise, aunque el actor ha relajado eso durante los últimos años con las secuelas de ‘Jack Reacher’ y ‘Top Gun’. No obstante, Ethan Hunt es el personaje que mejor refleja sus posibilidades como héroe de acción y además nunca tuvo problemas en dejar que los directores de las diferentes entregas llevasen el material a su terreno. Por mi parte, creo que la saga tocó techo con la cuarta aventura de Hunt, pero la quinta entrega demostró que seguía en forma pese a que echase en falta un mayor empuje en la puesta en escena por parte de Christopher McQuarrie. Ahora se convierte en el primer realizador que repite en este universo con ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’, en la cual potencia más la acción respecto a su predecesora pero a cambio muestra más debilidades en su guion. Uno de los detalles más llamativos de ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’ es que es la primera secuela directa de la franquicia hasta ahora. Todas las anteriores entregas eran aventuras en la que todo quedaba zanjado, pero McQuarrie ha optado por dar una unión clara entre ‘Misión: Imposible – Nación Secreta’ y la que ahora nos ocupa, una idea muy estimulante sobre el papel pero que a la hora de la versas se ha saldado con resultados un tanto irregulares. El primer detalle llamativo del guion es que McQuarrie tiene algo menos de libertad para definir la película de forma individual, contando con un número limitado de personajes, algo esencial para que ciertas sorpresas del libreto se vean venir de lejos. Quieras que no, eso resta emoción a la aventura cuando las cosas se calman e incluso daña algún momento de mayor intensidad dramática. Es ahí donde se empiezan a ver las costuras a la fórmula de la saga, algo más o menos tapado hasta entonces por los sucesivos cambios de estilo de cada director que iba dejando su sello. Ya en ‘Nación secreta’ fue donde menos noté ese punto, pero hasta cierto punto eso seguía siendo algo diferente en la franquicia. Aquí eso no sucede y los trucos del libreto de McQuarrie resultan más obvios de lo deseable, aunque no tarda en dar con la tecla para que eso nunca llegue a resultar demasiado molesto. Considero que las comparaciones con ‘Mad Max: Furia en la carretera’ son un tanto exageradas, ya que ‘Misión: Imposible – Fallout’ tienes muchos más momentos de calma para desarrollar la historia y que todo respire. Sin embargo, McQuarrie sí que eleva considerablemente las dosis de acción y demuestra una solvencia pocas veces vista en el género durante los últimos años -aunque eso no le da para igualar el impresionante segmento de Dubai de la cuarta entrega, aún hoy la mejor-, algo a lo que ayuda mucho la implicación de Cruise en las escenas más arriesgadas. Últimamente estamos demasiado acostumbrados a que los rápidos cambios de plano en el montaje disimulen coreografías cuestionables, pero aquí todo es muy limpio, algo que atrapa al espectador, sobre todo a medida que la sensación de montaña rusa va acentuándose. De esta forma, incluso lo que en sí mismo consideraríamos locuras o fantasmadas funciona de maravilla, sobre todo volver a ver Hunt corriendo sin que nada pueda pararle o ese “combate” entre helicópteros. Eso no quita para que McQuarrie también incida algo en la ya algo avanzada edad de Cruise. Es asombroso que sea capaz de hacer lo que hace a estas alturas de su vida, pero tampoco es un superhombre que pueda con todo y ahí aparecen en determinados momentos Rebecca Ferguson y un inspirado Henry Cavill para recordárnoslo. Con todo, él sigue siendo la estrella y no seré yo el que se oponga mientras siga dándolo todo en personajes que encajen con él -lo de ‘La momia’ sí que fue un tanto risible’-. En definitiva, ‘Misión Imposible – Fallout’ es una buena película de acción y una nueva aventura de Ethan Hunt que no desmerece dentro de la saga pese a que el guion presente ciertos problemas. A cambio las escenas de acción son impecables y numerosas, lo cual ayuda a que su extenso metraje se pase volando. Me vale.",POSITIVE
"Jul 7, 2019"," 
    It’s on for the relatively young and old in the sixth M.I. go-round, with Cruise, Rhames, Pegg, Harris, Ferguson and Baldwin back on deck, Cavill joining the ranks as an
    agenda-heavy CIA agent and Christopher McQuarrie taking the reins once more after 2015’s Rogue Nation. Conspicuously MIA are three plutonium cores, stolen by terrorists for their
    usual nefarious reasons. Having bungled their retrieval, Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise. Of course!) and his amiable IMF offsiders Benji and Luther (Pegg and Rhames) are now
    tasked with getting them back. Which brings us all to Paris and the bonkers, boundary-smashing stunt work that pretty much the entire world knows T.Cruise actually does in the
    exhausting—and yet so fun to watch!—service of saving mankind.
 
    Because oh, what beauties those stunts are, with a smashing HALO (High Altitude Low Impact) plane jump into the City of Light to blast them off and the
    fanciest of motorcycle and auto footwork on the ground. Plus, the man runs. And runs. And then runs some more, despite an actual broken ankle. That alone is something to see, even before his
    spectacular, climactic chopper action in Kashmir.
 
    When not tearing it up in Ninja Warrior mode, the mood of the lavish production is a nice balance of purposeful to sombre. Everyone involved takes the business of monkey very seriously indeed,
    not least a careworn Ethan, who while still fighting fit plainly carries the shadow of a life hard-lived. As well he should, for in essence the burden of duty is what the showboating is all
    about. The so-called impossible is always a trial by fire and no matter how fast you sprint, that heat has eventually got to hurt.

"Jun 18, 2019"," To ask the question on everyone’s mind: Are we really supposed to care about a new Mission Impossible movie without the return of Jeremy Renner as everyone’s favorite character, um, I want to say…Hawkeye? Renner jokes aside, although everyone should always stop to make those, the most ridiculous stunt involving this series is that it has somehow existed for 22 years. Understandably, that longevity has bought the latest film, Mission Impossible: Fallout, some measure of forgiveness for its hubris in assuming we actually retain plot points after these films are over. Self-important and impossibly troubling to anyone who remembers how Tom Cruise has (allegedly) treated women in real life, Fallout is ultimately a pretty fun watch, even if it does feel like an uncomfortably long passionate kiss slurped on the lips of practical stuntwork. Despite a distinct lack of tinkering or tailoring, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie’s LeCarre ambitions bloat what should have been a kinetic MacGuffin chase. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is tracking down three plutonium shotputs before bad guys can nuke stuff with them. Somehow that singular sentence is stretched into 150 minutes, the best of which see Henry Cavill, a punchable meatsack, getting walloped in his infamous mustache. Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) are back to soak up more screen time without offering a single modicum of actual character. Over the course of a half-dozen movies, all we know is that Luther often wears hats and Benji is almost funny sometimes. The series has become this monolithic memorial to the integrity and sacrifice of Ethan Hunt, who is a lucky idiot that makes bad choices like that was his real accepted mission. Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns from the last film and immediately betrays her country and her own well-being because she is powerless before Ethan’s puffy-faced running. The love of Ethan’s life, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), whom he abandoned because his boner belongs to freedom before all else, appears to seemingly reassure audiences that her life as a woman only has meaning through Ethan’s context. Thankfully, the execution of preposterous stunts is feverishly meticulous, with layered components that feel like glorious Rube Goldberg machines of death. Have you seen two helicopters slap-fight before? What about fisticuffs that use bathroom plumbing parts as deadly weapons? In all seriousness, Fallout could have been a silent film and been legitimately better than the version that exists with “Oops! All Berries!” amounts of exposition. To the franchise’s credit, it appears they are setting Angela Bassett up as Ethan’s new handler, they have wisely figured out how using a recurring bad guy saves hand-wringing villain origin screen time and the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is exactly the sort of minor player that could help make Mission Impossible’s next 22 years more fun. Just please remember in the future that when your target demo is men who are likely keeping an eye on their prostatic lab work, maybe pare things down until it’s just the “oohs,” “ahs” and “oh nos?”",POSITIVE
"Jun 3, 2019","This is top-tier action filmmaking, the kind of no-holds-barred, balls-to-the-wall extravaganza that manages to root its spectacle in actual human emotion.",POSITIVE
"May 26, 2019"," Although the usual media blitz associated with a Tom Cruise vehicle is in full swing, much of the attention is understandably focusing on the real-life injury that made it into the final cut of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sixth installment in the 22-year old franchise. Such an on-set injury not only gets people talking, but Cruise’s passion is on full display in his dedication to giving the audience what they want, even at his own expense. And thank goodness. Tom Cruise is nuts (find out just how nuts here), but he’s nuts on-camera for our benefit; and the Mission Impossible franchise is all the richer for it, record-breaking 80-million dollar insurance claims aside. Fallout is chock-full of breath-taking stunts like the one in which Cruise busted his ankle (which is also featured in the trailers), along with a shipload of exposition right up front. Luckily, the filmmakers wisely follow-up on such pre-titles set-up repeatedly during the movie, so it’s reinforced—you don’t have to remember all of it on your own. Viewing all five of the earlier installments is also unnecessary (but it wouldn’t hurt since past characters resurface) since the filmmakers make it a point to explain everything and everyone, albeit sometimes in a ham-fisted way. But you may have to go to the bathroom during the previews since Fallout is a bladder-busting 2 and 1/2 hours. But at least you don’t have to sit through the entire credit roll since there is no end-credits tag. But MI6 is fun, exciting, and over-the-top right where it needs to be except for some seriously funny overacting between newcomer Henry Cavill and series staple Angela Bassett. But don’t let their scene-chewing distract you since you need to pay attention: Fallout features multiple double-crosses which overlap as the runtime wears on. Fallout would have benefitted from some tightening in its exposition to be sure, but also even in some of the extended action/chase scenes, which would have corrected its main flaw: being unnecessarily overlong. The plot is admittedly somewhat standard stuff; bad guy threatening civilized society with black-market nukes. But in the capable hands of writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Edge of Tomorrow) and Cruise (who also serves as producer), such stereotypical action-flick fodder is elevated—via equal parts personal vendetta and—to something else; the action event of the summer.",NEGATIVE
"May 21, 2019"," Above all else, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an action movie. It has nothing particularly cogent to say about espionage, politics, or human interaction but it has a lot to show in the way of action sequences. Three immediately stand out and there at least another three that threaten to rival them. One standout is a very straightforward chase scene. Our hero, Tom Cruise’s secret agent Ethan Hunt, is on a motorcycle pursued by dozens of police in cars at every corner. The chase seems to go on forever and ends with a riveting bang. But for good measure we’re also given a car vs motorcycle standoff, a helicopter showdown, and a three person bathroom fight. None of these sequences is extraneous or perfunctory. Instead, they are thoughtfully and expertly rendered with technical proficiency. Film, we’re often reminded, is a visual medium but it’s the precision of the sound effects and the smoothness of the sound mixing that turn these action sequences from good to excellent. Listen for the rev of the engine as a stationary motorcycle finally takes off. The screech as a car skids off . The dizzying sound of a fist connecting with muscle. The cacophony of a vehicle hitting into a truck hitting into another vehicle. Those incidents are par for the course in this genre, but the immersive soundscape of Fallout is not just coasting on the familiar but offering a dizzying, sometimes disorienting aural trip for the audience. A trip that deepens when the sound mixing opts for moments of silence in between key points. Or to let that catchy Mission Impossible theme seep into the narrative. This movie sounds better than most, if not all, 2018 releases, even when what it’s actually saying becomes ridiculous. The initial mission of Fallout is compromised early on when Hunt botches a job because he opts to save a member of his team and allows some valuable weapons to be stolen. And so he must now hunt down some missing plutonium that could create anarchy in the world via the nuclear weapons made from it. This early decision is key to the view Fallout has of Hunt as the action hero who cares about the individual life of one as much as the collective lives of many. It’s meant to represent his nobility, but Fallout works worst when it tries to argue for Hunt as a moral arbiter of excellence. Cruise is a reliable action star—the series would not work without his tenacity—but Hunt is strangely hard to root for as a character who is not near as charming or emotionally compelling as the film makes him out to be. This is an action movie, so naturally Hunt’s task of stopping a terrorist group from carrying out a deadly mission with nuclear bombs ends up being more complicated than we anticipated. It’s a strange set-up as beyond the abstract worry of world destruction, there’s little real suspense as to what becomes of this mythical contemporary world that the series represents. But geopolitical verisimilitude is not on the menu here. It doesn’t need to be. What we do have is Ethan Hunt on a breathless new adventure with a number of complications thrown in. He has the new director of the CIA breathing down his neck (an underused Angela Bassett enunciating as if her life depended on it), a beleaguered boss (a beleaguered Alec Baldwin), his trustworthy sidekicks (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, who do fair work but often feel thrown in to prop Hunt up which becomes slightly annoying), a former co-worker and potential adversary in the form of Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa (decisive and compelling even when the film gives her little to do) and a more direct foil in the figure of the CIA assassin he’s forced to work alongside in the figure of Henry Cavill’s Agent Walker. Cavill is my favourite in the cast by a mile even though his role, as large as it is, still feels underdeveloped. Cavill nails the tonal shifts between full-blown action and reluctant comedy with panache. It’s a confident performance that is just the right note of ironic to become subversive. But Fallout is not a film for actors to show their chops, especially if their name is not Tom Cruise. Like any film in the series, it is ultimately only Cruise who is provided with a real platform for much depth. The emotional stakes when they come late in the film make me shrug even though they are meant to be emotionally profound. Ethan Hunt just is not that compelling, and the film’s almost sycophantic view of him (of course, a new female character must find him so beguiling she must make out with him in a heated moment) does not help the situation. It doesn’t really matter, though, because Christopher McQuarrie with his direction (more than his screenplay) has injected Fallout with enough technical finesse that this action movie thrills enough. And so, even the most ridiculous of situations make you gasp from the spectacle of the action rather than strain credulity at the levels to which you must suspend your disbelief for it to make sense. More style than substance. But what style!",POSITIVE
"May 15, 2019"," The Mission: Impossible TV series always had a strong focus on teams, but ever since the entire team was killed off in the first movie, the focus has been on Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). While the first entry is a classic, it only seemed to get worse with the second. However, by the time the third movie came along, they were more willing to bring on supporting players including the first appearance of Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Then the fourth movie arrived, and it was like they completely changed genres. They embraced the team dynamic entirely, and the franchise became better for it. This sixth entry leans in on that even more and is easily the strongest in the series so far. Director Christopher McQuarrie didn't want to come back after directing 2015's Rogue Nation, but Paramount Pictures and Cruise were able to convince him to return. It was a good thing, because McQuarrie has found a way to amp up the action scenes while also realizing that these supporting players are what set this series apart from the Bournes or the Bonds (the latter of which tend to waste the talents of the supporting players). For Fallout McQuarrie brings back the fantastic Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethan's wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and new female characters as well. We're missing Brandt (Jeremy Renner) because Renner was off filming the Avengers movies at the time, but there are plenty of awesome people here to pick up the slack. The marketing has been playing up the absolutely insane action scenes, and they are rather spectacular. They are also varied, which is nice. This isn't just one car crash after another — it manages to cover all the bases of action movies. The fights are brutal and the stakes are clear, so we understand what happens if the bad guys win. We get plenty of character beats, and Henry Cavill's Augustus Walker is a welcome addition to the team as somewhat of an antithesis to Hunt. That's not to say there aren't flaws, but they are at most nitpicky. It runs a little long, but you don't feel that until you have to stand up after the movie ends. It's a little too obsessed with double-crosses and backstabbing (there might be one too many by the end), but it doesn't drag the movie down too much. Mission: Impossible – Fallout isn't a perfect movie, but it's about as close to Mad Max: Fury Road quality as an action movie has come in a long time. This series continues to get better, and it's been extremely entertaining watching an action series like this find itself in its recent entries.",POSITIVE
"May 4, 2019"," Up to this point each Mission: Impossible film has operated on their own mechanisms.  The 1996 Brian De Palma-directed original felt like an organic extension of the 1960’s television series it drew its inspiration from; the 2000-released sequel was an orgy of unsubtle combat buoyed by the favoured-slow motion of Hong Kong filmmaker Jon Woo; J.J. Abrams’ second sequel in 2006 felt slightly more grounded in comparison, coming off like an appendage of the director’s own TV project Alias; 2011’s Ghost Protocol, under the eye of Brad Bird (The Incredibles), adopted the IMAX gimmick and went for broke in what possibilities lay in extravagance; and Christopher McQuarrie’s Rogue Nation in 2015 adhered to the modern temperament of the genre by delivering spectacle that didn’t overrun an intricate story. So where do we sit with Fallout? The 6th entrant in this surprisingly robust series –  one that has defied expectation at practically every turn – is very much a continuation of Rogue Nation, perhaps earning it the right to be considered the series’ first legitimate sequel.  Christopher McQuarrie (the first director to pull returning duties behind the camera) clearly knows how to juggle the extremities of the genre, and whilst he is working with a story that is rife with obstacles, he never lets it get the best of him; and why should he when he wrote the damn thing!  Instead he places trust in his ingredients, and what’s the one base flavour that is sure to never fail? One Mr. Tom Cruise. At this point it’s getting a bit tired to continually defend Cruise from an acting perspective.  His personal life and beliefs are open to criticism, but as an entertainer he’s undoubtedly one of the most committed to the craft.  Since the series’ conception Cruise has been performing all his own stunts and, much like each respective film, they’ve only gotten more high-stake (i.e. dangerous) as they’ve gone along.  It was highly publicised that Cruise fractured an ankle bone during a stunt that required him to leap from roof-to-roof throughout a London-based sequence (the footage ultimately remains in the finished film), and instead of taking the recommended 9 weeks off he returned to set a mere 5 weeks later, only to shoot a sequence that required extensive running throughout the streets of Paris.  You can’t tell me that isn’t dedication to your job. As for why Cruise is jumping across rooftops and running throughout Parisian streets, well that’s because his unstoppable IMF agent Ethan Hunt is looking to foil the nuclear plot of a mysterious villain known only as John Lark, the leader of a group of international libertines dubbed The Apostles.  Lark is due to score a suitcase full of plutonium through a trade with a sensual arms dealer known as The White Widow (The Crown‘s Vanessa Kirby, seemingly channeling Vanessa Redgrave), and it’s come down to Ethan and his right-handers Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) to infiltrate the deal. This would all be well and good if Ethan wasn’t being monitored by strapping assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill, proving the Justice League-disrupting moustache was worth the growth), called out by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) who believes Hunt is no longer as dedicated to the job as he should be.  Add to that complication the return of Rogue Nation‘s shadowy MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and homicidal anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), and you’re left with a plot that could potentially buckle under its own weight. It does help to pay attention to the various double, even triple crossing McQuarrie’s script throws about with reckless abandon – not helped by the onslaught of action set-pieces that have been masterfully choreographed to steal focus at every turn – but there’s a brilliance at work here where everything falls so neatly into place once the dust has settled.  But really, who cares about details when the film’s alphas Hunt and Walker graduate from a dazzling hand-to-hand combat in the men’s room of a Parisian nightclub to a helicopter chase above the clouds of Kashmir before battling atop a towering cliff, all the while a duo of bombs begin their inevitable countdown towards expected doomsday. When it boils down to it, Fallout may still be somewhat cliched in terms of genre mentality, but it knows how to toy with the expected and present itself as a fresh product that we can’t help but gobble up in excess.  Now, is it too early to request M:I-7?",POSITIVE
"Apr 16, 2019"," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to watch Mission Impossible: Fallout and not get swept away by the old-school, over-the-top spy chaos. Should you choose to accept this mission, you'll join Tom Cruise as he confidently returns to the role of Ethan Hunt, indestructible secret agent. Someone's stolen some plutonium and Hunt has to round up his chums in the Impossible Mission Force for more death-defying, gravity-defying and, frankly, common-sense-defying action scenes. A lot of movies are referred to as roller-coaster rides, but in this case it barely seems like a metaphor: very few films throw its stars and audiences around quite as much as the Mission: Impossible series, and this adrenaline-pumping sixth outing is no exception. As cutting-edge as the stuntwork is, the word ""Fallout"" seems like a faintly quaint title. This oddly dusty term evokes the nuclear paranoia of the Cold War rather than the more modern preoccupation with devious data and sinister surveillance often seen in today's espionage thrillers. And Mission: Impossible - Fallout does have a certain old-school feel to it. The story begins in Belfast and Berlin, two cities that have put their troubled pasts as geopolitical hotspots of skullduggery behind them. The bad guys wear moustaches and impeccable three-piece suits. And the implausible high-tech gadgetry is kept to a minimum -- even the iconic introductory tape comes hidden in a book. Pleasingly for anyone struggling to distinguish the Mission: Impossible franchise from other all-action espionage movies, at least one part of the team's plan comes straight from the original 1960s TV show. You might also spot echoes of The Dark Knight's and The French Connection's most memorable action scenes, not to mention surprising similarities to the most recent James Bond movies.  Of course, the title isn't really a reference to the devastation that'll be wrought should the IMF team fail to retrieve the contraband nuclear material. It refers to the fact the film is basically Tom Cruise falling out of things. Helicopters, planes, windows, cliffs, huge sewer gratings: there isn't anything Cruise won't fling himself into, onto or out of in the name of a thrilling action sequence. You've got to hand it to him: you really feel like it's Cruise himself rather than a digital double doing all the running and jumping. And what running and jumping it is. I'm not sure there's anything to quite compete with the realisation that it was actually Cruise clinging to the side of an actual skyscraper in Ghost Protocol or to the side of an actual aeroplane in Rogue Nation, but the relentless breathless action scenes still set the standard for big, loud set pieces. It's definitely worth seeing Fallout in IMAX format, or even in a 4DX theatre -- one of those rollercoaster-style theatres with seats that tilt and vibrate while jets of air and misted water are sprayed over you.  Mission: Impossible - Fallout was my first experience of 4DX, and I can't decide if it's the worst thing that's ever happened in the history of cinema or the perfect way to watch this kind of ridiculous adrenaline ride. Randomly flashing strobe lights are annoying and your seat jostling you at inappropriate moments is distracting, but when slower movement is twinned with subtle onscreen camerawork it's surprisingly effective at drawing you into the moment. And I admit, by the end, when the screen is just filled with absolutely nonsensical carnage, it actually makes sense to have your seat jerking around so violently you feel like you're about to be fired through the screen, where you'll find yourself blinking in the street picking popcorn out of your hair and wondering what the heck just happened. Fallout isn't just delirious action, though it's mostly delirious action. There is also some cinematic deftness on display alongside the theme park convulsions. Director Christopher McQuarrie and cinematographer Rob Hardy inject some elan between the action, particularly in a stylish silent shootout, a sinister opening dream sequence and a party that seems to come from another age. These quieter scenes also give composer Lorne Balfe room to breathe with brooding teases of the iconic M:I music ... before unleashing a bombastic sonic barrage chaotic enough to match the visual bombardment. British actors Rebecca Ferguson and Sean Harris return from the previous movie, Rogue Nation, bringing a real touch of class even if they're underused. Thankfully, Jeremy Renner's useless sidekick from the last two films is jettisoned to make way for moustachioed Henry Cavill, a CIA agent who's the hammer to Ethan Hunt's scalpel. Cavill is meant to be a wild card, brought into the fold to keep an eye on the team and ready to shut things down if necessary. Mostly though he's too useless to be threatening, coming across as a dim-witted lummox rather than a credible menace. Anyway, where was I ... oh, yes, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to come out of this ludicrous movie without a smile on your face. As always, should you or any of your force not be caught up in the comically over-the-top capers, the Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions. Wait a minute, is this thing on?",POSITIVE

"Apr 2, 2019"," 22 años después de la primera aparición de Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise sigue haciendo de las suyas. Mientras nosotros no podemos soportar una cruda de dos días, este pedazo de Hollywood destilado en músculo irredento salta de cornisas, derriba helicópteros y escala muros de roca sin cuerda a sus 56 años. Basada en la exitosa serie de finales de los sesenta, Mission: Impossible encontró en Cruise a un héroe de acción inagotable que, en la segunda década de los dosmiles, de la mano de Brad Bird (The Incredibles) y Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher) ha mantenido una promesa imposible de entretenimiento. Porque ésta no es la era de las cintas de acción. Ya no existen héroes como alguna vez lo fueron Seagal, Van Damme, Norris, Stallone o Schwarzenegger. Ya no se puede hablar inocentemente de terroristas y las películas hollywoodenses no pueden apañarse fácilmente la xenofobia típica de la guerra fría. Pero el género muerto de la acción sigue pataleando a través de un héroe insospechado de eterna necedad sadomasoquista. Mission: Impossible – Fallout es la sexta entrega de una franquicia que, sobre los esfuerzos de Brian De Palma, J.J. Abrams y John Woo, se ha mantenido como un dinosaurio extraño que se niega a la extinción. Frente a los fracasos recientes de la franquicia de Jack Reacher, de la franquicia agotada de Jason Bourne y los esfuerzos horriblemente estériles de Jason Statham en The Transporter, podemos decir que Tom Cruise es verdaderamente uno de los últimos grandes héroes de acción. Un héroe que, antes de irse, nos ha dejado un legado impresionante de sana diversión madreadora. Ésta no es una película inteligente, no es una película bien escrita y no es una película particularmente ingeniosa. Pero es una cinta hecha con inmensa pasión, tremendamente filmada, brillantemente editada y que, sobre todo, entiende qué es lo que quiere y cómo quiere lograrlo. Como una de las mejores cintas de acción gringa que se hayan hecho en los últimos años, Mission: Impossible – Fallout merece una mirada sin prejuicios que sepa reconocer el logro demente de filmar un salto HALO con una cámara IMAX amarrada a un casco. Nada más, es cierto, pero nada menos. Mission: Impossible – Fallout empieza con una secuencia onírica: Hunt está parado, en una orilla, frente a Julia, su esposa perdida. Se observan amorosamente mientras Solomon Lane, el demente terrorista que capturó en Ghost Protocol, oficia una ceremonia de bodas. Horrorizado, Hunt observa cómo explota lejanamente una bomba nuclear que arrasa con todo. Como Sarah Connor años atrás, el personaje interpretado por Tom Cruise se levanta bañado en sudor y dudas. A partir de ahí, la cinta expone claramente cuál es el meollo: los Apóstoles de Lane siguen activos a pesar de la captura de su jefe. El IMF sabe que estos terroristas radicales encontraron a un iluminado científico nuclear que tiene la capacidad de fabricar tres bombas ultrapotentes. El intercambio de los núcleos radiactivos se hará pronto en Berlín. Así que Hunt y su equipo se encaminan para allá. Pero la misión sale horriblemente mal: para salvar a Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) de una muerte segura, Hunt pierde los núcleos y ahora el mundo está en serio peligro. El equipo de Hunt tendrá que hacer una búsqueda frenética para encontrar las armas nucleares y desarmarlas antes de que empujen a la frágil geopolítica global hacia un desastre. Pero el IMF está bajo estricto control y Hunt deberá aceptar la vigilancia de August Walker (Henry Cavill con el famoso bigotillo), un asesino de la CIA cuyos métodos son algo menos discretos que los de Hunt, Stickell y Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Viejos amigos, nuevos enemigos y fantasmas del pasado recorren las 2 horas 27 minutos de pura adrenalina que dura la película. Una verdadera oda a la acción noventera más despreocupada y a la serie que le dio vida, hace cincuenta años. Las series de televisión clásicas no tenían nada que ver con el modelo de Netflix. La serialización estaba hecha para que la gente reconociera, cada semana, a los mismos personajes y a las mismas situaciones sin perderse en arcos narrativos demasiado amplios. Por eso, Mission: Impossible tenía una estructura tan reconocible: empezaba con una mecha prendida e imágenes del episodio para luego pasar a la típica escena del informe grabado (“Tu misión, si decides aceptarla…”, “… este mensaje se destruirá en cinco segundos”), tenía unas cuantas secuencias de planeación y de selección de los agente que integrarían la misión y terminaba con las convulsas secuencias de engaño y acción. Todos los episodios mantenían esta estructura para no confundir a los fanáticos de la serie, para ganar nuevos adeptos y para hacer inmediatamente reconocible una identidad. Cuando Brian de Palma y Tom Cruise decidieron llevar la serie a la pantalla grande, mantuvieron muchos gimmicks de esa identidad pero, también, volvieron la atmósfera de Mission: Impossible algo mucho más oscuro, contemporáneo y violento. Con las secuelas de John Woo y J.J. Abrams, el lazo con la serie original se perdió un poco en la acción convulsa y la caracterización, cada vez más profunda, de Ethan Hunt. Porque, desde Mission: Impossible III, Hunt dejó de ser un James Bond frío y despiadado para tener una debilidad: el amor hacia Julia, su prometida. Ahora, con esta sexta entrega, McQuarrie logra continuar el balance perfecto que cristalizó Brad Bird en Ghost Protocol: Ethan Hunt es un héroe humano, peligroso pero frágil. Aquí encontramos la debilidad de Hunt por los seres que quiere y que amenaza cada vez que emprende sus misiones suicidas. Y, de hecho, toda la cinta será una demostración de cómo Hunt es el más grande héroe porque no puede tomar la decisión de sacrificar una vida para salvar a millones. Así, junto a esta visión de Hunt creada por Abrams, tenemos toda la acción de John Woo, el vértigo de Brad Bird, la oscuridad de De Palma y el recuerdo siempre vivo de la serie original. De hecho, creo que esta cinta es la que mayor honor le hace a los tropos sesenteros de Mission: Impossible. Desde la secuencia de créditos vemos la intención de hacer referencias hasta lo ridículo: por ahí tenemos las escenas de engaño elaboradísimas (una de ellas incluye un cameo raro pero cada vez más frecuente a Wolf Blitzer), quid pro quos, disfraces, mensajes grabados que se autodestruyen, escenas de exposición absolutamente falsas y líneas de guión forzadas para explicar gadgets. Parece que esto fuera una crítica negativa. Pero, conforme más pasa tiempo, me doy cuenta de que, en verdad, esto es lo que hace a Fallout tan extrañamente original. No oculta los sinsentidos que le dieron vida a la trama original y, de hecho, quiere hacerle homenaje a las cuestiones más ridículas de la serie. En ese sentido, no se compromete a ser algo más de lo que es; no tiene pues, las pretensiones más serias de Ghost Protocol o la primera cinta y se deja llevar por una historia algo ridícula para encadenar, una a una, secuencias de acción cada vez más dementes. Todos saben que a Tom Cruise le gusta hacer sus propios stunts. Parte de los grandes actos de publicidad de todas sus películas es ver el placer casi sexual que le da poner su vida en peligro en el set de filmación. En una cinta escaló el edificio más alto del mundo, en otra se amarró a un avión gigantesco mientras despegaba. Después de esos dos trucos demenciales parecía que se le habían acabado los stunts dementes. Pero no, a Cruise nunca se le acaban los stunts dementes. En esta cinta, Cruise protagoniza, junto a Henry Cavill, un salto HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) a más de 30 kilómetros arriba de la superficie terrestre. Es una maldita locura. Pero aún más demente es cómo filmaron el salto: el reconocido fotógrafo aéreo Craig O’Brien grabó el salto amarrando un lente IMAX a su casco. Todo se siente pulcro y real. Al punto en que, cuando llegas al trepidante final de la cinta, con un cronómetro en una bomba nuclear en Cachemira y Tom Cruise saltando de un helicóptero en movimiento a otro, ya nada te sorprende. Como un recuerdo de las más pura locura de acción noventera, esta cinta no se preocupa mucho por el fondo y se deja llevar por las persecuciones en motocicleta, las madrizas interminables (incluyendo una secuencia en un baño que le hace todo el honor al primer James Bond de Daniel Craig) y la acción cada vez más alucinante. El resultado no nada más es divertido sino que es extrañamente refrescante. Hace tiempo que no veía una buena película de acción como antaño se hacían, hace tiempo que no sentía que podían existir grandes héroes de acción, hace tiempo que no experimentaba vértigo real y suspenso al filo del asiento. Mission: Impossible – Fallout es una película hueca, mal escrita, banal y, si se quiere, totalmente estúpida. Al mismo tiempo, está fabricada con precisión de relojero, un gusto hermoso para filmar películas de acción y un exuberante sentido de sus propias posibilidades. En ese sentido, es todo lo que necesita ser una buena película de acción: Fallout se basta a sí misma y destruye toda posibilidad de una crítica más profunda. Esto es diversión que se entiende como tal, que se hizo como tal y que vivirá en el recuerdo como una de las últimas grandes cintas de acción de nuestra generación. Un crítico de Indiewire comentaba que Ethan Hunt es un personaje único porque es el último héroe chapado a la antigua que se sacrifica, sin chistar, para salvar hasta la última vida humana. En ese sentido, Tom Cruise también se está sacrificando, una y otra vez, para mantener vivo un género que ya todos dábamos por muerto. Se amarra a aviones, tumba helicópteros, salta de la maldita estratósfera. En honor al sacrificio masoquista que Cruise hace gustoso, debemos decir que, si esta cinta descuida todo lo que podría darle más peso (guión, historia, personajes), es absolutamente obsesiva con los detalles minuciosos de la acción. Fallout sabe lo que quiere, sabe lo que prometió y sabe que lo entrega. Por eso, con creces, es la cinta más vacía y más divertida de toda la franquicia. Elenco: Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin y Wolf Blitzer	.",POSITIVE
"Mar 30, 2019"," Watching Mission: Impossible – Fallout on the big screen, I was worried I was being too obnoxious to my neighboring audience members. I crackled with glee, and, more than once, threw my hands up in disbelief. I had to react physically; I just couldn’t help myself. The things I saw — Tom Cruise doing a HALO jump from five miles up, Tom Cruise on a high-speed motorcycle chase around Paris, Tom Cruise making ankle-shattering hops across rooftops, Tom Cruise dangling from a helicopter, and Tom Cruise piloting a helicopter like it’s a bumper car — demanded my reaction. Filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Jack Reacher) deserves a lot of credit for pushing his and Cruise’s talents to the edge in a film that does far more than simply tack on an addition to the franchise. He evolves the series from safe summer blockbusters to something that feels wildly tangible and terrifying to watch. Seeing Cruise perform all these stunts himself, some of which took over a year of training, is something you don’t get from most movies. In a film world littered with green-screen solutions to everything, you don’t often see actors putting their lives (and limbs) at risk to fuel a stronger reaction from audiences. It makes the action all the more immersive and intense knowing the filmmakers and talent went the extra mile, and as a result, we get one of the most thrilling action movies ever made. The plot falls in line with many of the other Mission: Impossible films, but enough is shaken up to keep it fresh. In Fallout, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) must square up against a nuclear threat from the hands of imprisoned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, giving us his own reserved-but-creepy rendition of Heath Ledger’s Joker). Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust returns (a change of pace for a franchise whose women are usually nowhere to be found by the next installment) and crosses paths on a conflicting mission of her own with MI6. Meanwhile, CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, and the most expensive mustache) is assigned to watch Ethan’s every move, leading to many trust issues amongst the outfit. While the cast brings its A-game (also including Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin and series newcomers Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby), the film comes most alive during its jaw-dropping action. There are fist fights, car chases, foot chases and helicopter chases that ignite the fuse of excitement. To describe them in greater detail wouldn’t do them justice, especially one incredible set piece in Paris, which, like Mad Max: Fury Road, is a long chase sequence that, on many occasions, will make you go, “Ooh,” “ahh” and “ouch!” Then there’s the best scene of the movie — and believe me, there are too many great scenes to count — and it features a bathroom brawl to the death. The scene got a big reaction out of my audience, most notably when Cavill throws his enemy through a mirror and cocks his arms like they’re guns. McQuarrie and Cruise (also a producer) push scenes such as this further than you think they ever could, and it raises the stakes in a fashion that makes the limitations of these characters completely unpredictable. There’s also an incredible amount of intelligence put into Fallout‘s character moments. Solomon’s plot to use bombs to create (as he and the other baddies put it) a suffering large enough to bring about great peace puts Ethan to the ultimate test. Cruise isn’t afraid to show physical and emotional vulnerability this round. He’s always played Ethan as this invincible superhero who could face any mission. But here, he is challenged like he’s never been before. One key scene shows Ethan wrestling with the decision to let a police officer die or give himself over to the mission-driven man he needs to be. It’s like Solomon is inflicting his own philosophy of “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace” on him. Does he let one person die, or does he fail the mission at hand? He finally deals with the weight of his decisions, and it elevates the material. Fallout’s greatest flaw may also be its greatest asset. The film surprisingly shares a lot of DNA with Christopher Nolan’s directed works, principally The Dark Knight. From the smooth and inventive cinematography, to the Hans Zimmer-like score (trivia: composer Lorne Balfe worked with Zimmer on the Dark Knight films) and story beats, you can draw many comparisons. But any movie that takes a page (or, in this case, several pages) out of The Dark Knight, it arguably improves the quality of the product. Just look at Skyfall. Like The Dark Knight, Fallout provides more than a mere hero-versus-villain story. There’s much more on the playing field than obstacles laid down by the villain. At one point in the film, Solomon asks Ethan why he chooses to accept these missions. For Ethan, the answer is obvious: He can save the lives of many, and therefore it doesn’t matter what stands in his way, even if it’s death. For Cruise, it’s also apparent: to top what he has done before.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2019","Well, here we are: 6 films into a series that has taken up 22 years of our lives, with Mission: Impossible - Fallout being the most insane entry yet, but also the most fun.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2019"," The Mission: Impossible film franchise is one of the few that somehow got better and better after its third sequel struggle to make a dent at the box office. Not only did the later sequels were financially successful, they’re also critically darlings. Looking at Rottentomatoes.com, Mission: Impossible 4-6 received mid to high 90% rating. After a mission gone wrong and three nuclear missile heads are in the hands of a new group of terrorists known as The Apostles, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his teammates Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) must retrieve the weapons. When Hunt was getting an intel briefing from his boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), as to where he can find the nuclear weapons, they’re both got interrupted by a new CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Sloan is upset that the IMF team lost the nuclear heads and insists that her agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) must go with Ethan to retrieve them. First on their task is to capture and impersonate a man named John Lark (Liang Yang) and meet with a mysterious woman named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), in Paris who has the connection to the Apostles. But when Hunt and Walker met with White Widow, she insisted that they must break out an international terrorist and Hunt’s nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) from prison or they won’t get the nuclear weapons. Of course this complicates the mission but both Hunt and Walker went along and helped Lane escaped. Along the way, Hunt ran into an old friend Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). She’s also has her own mission and that is to eliminate Lane for good. Well, things never go as planned and Hunt must use all of his skills to try to save the world from chaos and also save those who he cares about. For the first time in franchise history, the same director and writer Christopher McQuarrie of the previous film has returned and take charge of this new mission. To my surprise, McQuarrie has exceeded what he created in the last picture. He crafted a complexed storyline that’s full of twists, drama, humor and big action sequences. By hiring new crew members, notably a new cinematographer and composer, he was able to differentiate this film from the last one. It’s clearly that he used Nolan’s The Dark Knight as his inspiration for this outing. The film even contains a big chase that’s very similar to a chase sequence from The Dark Knight. A big bathroom brawl, a spectacular motorcycle and car chase through the streets of Paris and a helicopter chase are the highlights of the set pieces. Cinematographer Rob Hardy is having a good year. He shot the excellent Annihilation for Alex Garland earlier this year and again for this film, he did a tremendous job. This film contains so many wide shots in the series since Woo’s Mission: Impossible 2. This is good because we the audience can actually see the action and not trying to figure out what’s going on super chaotic scenes. Shout out also goes to composer Lorne Balfe who apparently is the understudy of Hans Zimmer. So, of course this film’s score sounds like it’s was composed by Zimmer. There’s still the well know Mission: Impossible theme but Balfe made it sounded like something very original. Just a little trivia, Hans Zimmer did compose a Mission: Impossible film, he worked on the second one. With three box office bombs in a row, Cruise poured all of his performance into this film. He did the usual crazy stunts but was willing to show his character’s age and flaws by having him get his ass whooped a few times in the film. The rest of the cast members were pretty good too. I was afraid Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust might just be nothing more than a cameo but her role was an integral part of the story and as usual she saved Hunt’s life couple of times in the film. Simon and Luthor didn’t really have much to do except to be comic relief. Luther did have a touching scene with Ilsa, I really liked that scene. I liked the addition of Alec Balwin’s character and he even got involved in one action scene with the team members. Bassett and Cavill were a nice addition and I hope we see more of Bassett’s character in the next Mission film. Kirby’s White Widow is an interesting character and I thought she played the role quite well even though she didn’t get a lot of screen time. Having seen the film twice already, I can declare Fallout is the best Mission: Impossible film yet. It’s full of humor, great tensions and spectacular actions sequences. If there’s an IMAX, Dolby Cinema or other large vendor theater near you, go see it there. It’s definitely my favorite film of the summer and maybe even of the year. Glad you enjoyed it too Cindy. I haven’t felt this way about a summer blockbuster probably since I saw The Dark Knight ten years ago! I agree with you Ted. Mission Impossible: Fallout is especially worth it in IMAX (I saw it at the MN Zoo IMAX over the weekend). Glad Ivan and I saw it at Zoo IMAX too Ted! The scenery is spectacular, and it’s got all the action stuff I like. Dayum the motorbike chase scene is killer! I’m afraid one day Cruise will perish doing one of his crazy stunts! Yeah and Cruise is 56 years old! I don’t know when he’ll give up this franchise and hand it off to a new lead but all those running, jumping and flying helicopter, he seems to have some kind of a death wish. Easiest review I have written all year. So much pouring out of my mind to say. It’s such riveting white-knuckle cinema and I can’t wait to see it again. Hey Keith, glad to hear you’re fan of this one too! I had high expectations for it after seeing the trailer but never thought it exceeded my expectations. Saw this on Friday and had a blast with it as well. That fight scene in the men’s room was amazing as was seeing Tom Cruise doing lots of running again. Plus that scene below the helicopter was stunning…. Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond. Official blogger for the Twin Cities Film Fest (TCFF).

"Feb 27, 2019"," I’m not the biggest Tom Cruise fan, but when I first saw the trailer for Mission Impossible: Fallout, I was excited. In the sixth installment of the Mission Impossible franchise, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) race against the clock to correct a mission that’s gone terribly wrong. In an action movie, I don’t go in expecting great line delivery or even chemistry between characters. Most of the time I just want great fight choreography and big stunts. Mission Impossible: Fallout delivered on the former and the latter. The additions of Agent Walker (Henry Cavill) and Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) made for great interactions and when Cavill delivered his lines, they were just as intense as reloading his fists in that bathroom fight scene from the trailer. Not to mention that Bassett and Cavell together have so much chemistry that I wish they were a part of the same comic book cinematic universe. The IMF team of Ethan, Benji, and Luther are as in sync as ever with perfect comedic timing when needed and great gadget exposition when the times call for it. Rhames even has an emotional scene towards the end of the film with Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Unlike other action flicks, the movie was strong because of its characters and script, not in spite of it. I want to note that this installment of the Mission Impossible franchise has more stunts than any other. Not only are they grand examples of adventure but the focus on practical effects, the insistence of Cruise to do his own stunt work, and the use of real locations make its action stong in a visual and visceral sense. The only issues I have with the film are that some of the action scenes dragged on too long. There are pieces of the action sequence where the only sound used is the score. Although the music in this movie is great, 30-seconds of prolonged running doesn’t get better with a great track. With a car chase that just kept going and silent moments of ominous walking, I can’t say this movie was perfect. That being said, for a summer action flick with an amazing cast, new and old, I can overlook that piece and firmly say that I would love to watch Mission Impossible: Fallout on the big screen again. Even if it’s only to watch a supercut of Tom Cruise performing his own stunts. Appearing in the trailer, the rope climb onto the helicopter and jumping onto the other building – which resulted in a broken foot – are just two stunts out of an action-packed two and a half-hour ride.

"Feb 25, 2019"," So the last few weeks of movie-going have certainly had their ups and big time downs! Make sure you are following me on my youtube channel because some films I review there and some here (just some content speaks more to writing an essay and others to a video LOL). Also make sure you are following me at smilingldsgirl on Stardust and Letterboxd to have these mini reviews sooner. I did a full review for Sorry to Bother You so I won’t include that here but there are still 11 films I have seen since my last update. There were some highs and some definite lows! The first Mamma Mia is a bit of a guilty pleasure. It’s not a good movie but it’s effervescent vacation porn with some catchy songs sung terribly. In the sequel, we get catchy effervescent vacation porn but sung well so I’m on board! I really liked the entire cast and thought Lily James was great as a young Meryl. The movie didn’t judge her character but just presented her life and gave us happy energetic songs. That’s all I needed. A little more Meryl would have been nice but that’s the only problem I had with it. I have been listening to the soundtrack all summer! I’m not normally someone who decries spoilers (in fact, I find that super annoying) but in the case of Three Identical Strangers try to go in spoiler free. The twist blew me away! This is an incredibly engaging film. It starts out funny and light and then becomes something much darker. I was moved and amazed. If it wasn’t a documentary you wouldn’t believe it could be true. I have never seen an episode of Teen Titans Go but have heard nothing but how terrible the show is and how it is an affront to the original Teen Titans. I also was not impressed with the trailers, so you can imagine my surprise when I walked away having had a great time! I laughed harder at Teen Titans Go! To the Movies than I have at any other film this year except for Game Night. It was a hilarious satire on superhero movies and tropes. I also enjoyed the 2D animation with its comic book aesthetic and the voice cast from the original show were great. Nicholas Cage also gets some good laughs at Superman. I just really enjoyed it! While not as well written as some of the best of this franchise, Mission Impossible: Fallout is a great action film. The action set pieces are above reproach and they happen so much and so quickly that I never had time to think about the story or be bored while watching. The cast is all great including Tom Cruise who is evidently willing to do anything to get a compelling action scene. I still think Ghost Protocol is the best of the franchise because of its story but this is darn good. I wish the women had been used a little bit better but that’s a small nitpick. The Spy Who Dumped Me is a frustrating film of unmet potential. Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis have good chemistry and the action is shot well but its tonal shifts were jarring making the movie unpleasant and long. It had some silly moments but then mixed with brutal violence, nudity and other harsh content it was off-putting. The tone was just all over the place and it felt like McKinnon was the only one trying to make things work but even that got old after a while. I’m not the biggest horror/thriller fan but I do love Gabrielle Union so I thought I would give Breaking In a shot. Unfortunately it ended up being a pretty mediocre film. It’s not terrible and there are some entertaining moments but as a whole it didn’t work. I liked the kid actors and Gabrielle Union is great as usual but it’s all extremely by the numbers and generic. They also obviously decided to make this PG-13 at the last-minute so there are tons of ‘freakin’ where obviously the f word was intended which is distracting. It’s no secret I haven’t been a big fan of these Disney live action remakes, but I was actually excited for Christopher Robin. My hope was it would feel fresh and sweet like the great Pete’s Dragon remake. Unfortunately I was disappointed. The entire premise didn’t work for me with Christopher forgetting his promise to Pooh and becoming the tired evil man of business. This left the 100 Acre Woods as kind of gloomy and sad with the characters waiting for Christopher to return. Christopher is supposed to be a terrible parent but in reality he is working to save his entire team their jobs. He’s the hero! They should have had his daughter Madeline find Pooh. That would have made way more sense since she is being sent to boarding school. Her interacting with the friends of the 100 Acre Woods might actually been magical. Here it is just a weak version of Hook and Paddington without either’s whimsy and charm (especially compared to Paddington). The only things I liked were the overall aesthetic, a scene at a train station where Pooh gets a balloon and a bonus credit song by Richard Sherman! Other than that this movie was an Eeyore! Everyone knows I love a good romance but the cinemas have been alarmingly short of them in recent years. (If you like romances check out my podcast on Hallmark films Hallmarkies Podcast). Before seeing Crazy Rich Asians I read the book by Kevin Kwan and for the most part the film does a good job adapting the novel. It stars Constance Wu and the super hot Henry Golding as a couple who are dating in America but things get rocky when he takes her to meet his ‘crazy rich’ family in Singapore. For what it is trying to be Crazy Rich Asians is just about perfectly executed. It’s funny, romantic, sweet and big hearted. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The cast is great including Awkwafina who stole all her scenes. Michelle Yeow plays a convincing villain because her point of view makes sense. It might be a cold view but it comes from her life experience so it is reasonable. Overall it’s a movie that has it all! I know the title is a mouthful but I loved the book so was very disappointed to hear this was not going to go to theaters but only to Netflix. Sometimes that can be a sign of a poor film but not in this case. I really loved it! Lily James is wonderful as Juliet an author who starts conversing with a man from Guernsey and learning the story about his secret book club. This society or club helped them get through some tough tiems during the German occupation. The entire cast is wonderful including a very dreamy Michael Huisman and Penelope Wilton who is always great in everything. Matthew Goode has a wonderful supporting role as Juliet’s publisher friend Sidney. It’s beautifully filmed by Mike Newell and will make you want to go to the Channel Islands. They do a good job mixing the light and fluffy with sincere and moving moments. I loved it! I wish we could at least get a fathom event to see it on the big screen for one night only. Come on Netflix! I’m normally not a big fan of these ensemble films like I hated Mother’s Day and New Years Eve. However, Dog Days proved to be a pleasant surprise. While it will be too cheesy for some, I found it really sweet and heartfelt. Pretty much every storyline worked for me. My favorites were an elderly man and teenager trying to find his dog and a family with a newly adopted little girl bonding over a dog. I also liked a romance between 2 news anchors that grows because of their mutual love of dogs. It was sweet, funny and I teeared up a few times. Dog Days is a charmer! And now for the movie that made me want to die. I had a feeling Duck Duck Goose would be a bad movie but as someone who loved Son of Bigfoot last year I always go into films with an open mind. Unfortunately Duck Duck Goose proved to be even worse than I could have imagined. It is right up there with Norm of the North for one of the worst animated films I have ever seen. I hated the animation. I hated the characters. I hated the humor. I hated the weird attempts to appeal to a Chinese market. I hated the unearned sentimentality. I hated how mean spirited it was and just overall unpleasant I hated the villain cat. I am someone who liked The Nut Job 2 so I don’t just dismiss films like this but it was atrocious in every respect. Do not show it to your kids! There are plenty of other things to watch on Netflix. I enjoyed ‘Mission: Impossible Fallout’ even more than I was anticipating.  I don’t know why I was surprised.    Maybe it’s because this is the sixth entry and I was expecting to see some signs of fatigue in the franchise by now.  The last three have been uniformly outstanding.  This just might possibly be my favorite, although Ghost Protocol is definitely up there too. One of my favorites of the summer. Again, another nice variety of movies. Mission: Impossible was an absolute blast. I can’t wait to see it again. Christopher Robin is one I haven’t seen and for some reason can’t muster any enthusiasm. Hoping to see Guernsey Literary this weekend.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2019", 5 things you might want to know about “Mission Impossible: Fallout” spoiler free and in about 5 minutes! Stay tuned for the best ever challenge at the end!,POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2019"," So after catching up on all the awards season favourites and others I missed over the last 12 months, my ultimate summation of 2018 in cinema overall is that it was…a mixed bag. I mean, there were some absolute gems this year, but filling out this list with worthy candidates was a lot harder than it has been in previous years. I wouldn’t say it was a bad year for film though. I just don’t want to linger on negativity anymore, which is a big reason I haven’t done a “worst of” list this year and probably never will again. Moving forward as a critic, I want to put celebrating cinema first and foremost, but by no means does that mean I’m going to stop writing negative reviews or turn my brain off. It just means less disparaging humour and more practical critique. With that said, I do genuinely love every film on this list, even though I could nitpick plenty of them if I was so inclined. In a year that was otherwise filled with uncertainty and impending crisis, we need to focus the positives we do have, and in some ways that makes the great movies we did get this year even sweeter. So enough with the procrastinating. On with the list! We had two dramas about conversion therapy this year, and whilst The Miseducation of Cameron Post was a solid effort Boy Erased goes just that little bit further into driving home how dehumanising a practice it is. Joel Edgerton continues to he’s just as talented a writer/director as he is an actor, if not more so, with this tale of a young man attempting to find himself through this abusive process. Lucas Hedges’ lead performance is yet another stellar role in a still-young career, whilst Russell Crowe, Nicole Kidman and Edgerton himself deliver some of their best work in recent years. It is a harrowing but necessary reflection of the bigotry still present in our society, and one I hope can open up a few hearts to acceptance. It seems ever more unlikely that we are ever going to see a third Raid movie, but this spiritual successor featuring two of its stars is a more than worthy substitute. The Night Comes For Us is a straightforward but compelling crime thriller that leaps quickly into the action and rarely lets up from there. Every fight sequence in this film would be the landmark scene in any western action film, but all are executed with top-notch choreography and slick cinematography and editing. Top it all off with a manic leading man turn by Joe Taslim and fun supporting turns from the likes of Iko Uwais, Zack Lee and Julie Estelle, and this is one lovers of dark, bloody action extravaganzas should not miss out on. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins once again returns to exploring the African-American experience through this emotionally devastating adaptation of the James Baldwin novel. An ever-relevant look at racial bias in the justice system, If Beale Street Could Talk somehow manages to find beauty and heart in the unjust tragedy of two lovers kept apart by prejudice. Bolstered by phenomenal performances and Nicholas Britell’s gorgeous score, this is yet another notch in Jenkins’ already well-adorned belt. Winter’s Bone director Debra Granik returns to once again explore the dark side of rural America in this sombre and affecting drama. Ben Foster’s lead performance as a veteran wracked with PTSD living in the forests of Oregon is a career best, but young Thomasin McKenzie is the true revelation here. As Foster’s precocious daughter, she holds her own against veteran actors and comes away with not just the movie but our hearts. A true indie gem likely to be looked over by general audiences and the Academy, Leave No Trace is the perfect antidote for those wanting something other than multi-million dollar blockbusters and flashy awards bait. The rape revenge sub-genre is often used merely for sleaze, and in this day and age it’s a trope we should have left behind long ago. But then here comes Revenge, a biting and relentless retort to the concept that indulges in its B movie inspirations whilst setting itself apart with a definitively feminist point-of-view. Coralie Fargeat in her feature debut directs with style and grit, painting a visceral picture that never shies away from being bloody or racy, but manages to avoid falling into exploitation. Its premise is simple and the characters basic, but they all serve the greater purpose of genre critique, and that simplicity allows the film shine with some of the best non-verbal storytelling in recent memory. Matilda Lutz’s lead performance is a star-making turn, and her character of Jen has the potential to become a cult icon for female lovers of action and horror cinema; she truly is the ultimate final girl. Apparently you can make the same movie four times and still make it work, as this 2018 remake of the 1976 remake of the 1954 remake of the 1937 original certainly proves. Who knew Lady Gaga was this good an actor or, for that matter, that Bradley Cooper was this good a singer and director? Wonderfully updating the timeless story of rising fame and fallen stardom to our modern perception of celebrity, A Star is Born will tug at the heartstrings of even those who have seen this story play out time and time again. Plus, the music is just gorgeous. Perhaps Wes Anderson should just stick to making stop-motion pictures, because that seems to be the only time I can ever stand his kitsch. Isle of Dogs is a beautifully animated and wonderfully witty animated adventure through a near-future Japan, with an all-star cast lending their voices to the slew of pups that are our heroes. Probably the most accessible film in Anderson’s catalogue to date, it has just enough cute factor to keep younger audiences engaged whilst providing oodles of hidden depths and background humour to make it an even richer experience for adults. Yorgos Lanthimos brings his peculiar view of the world to the British costume drama in this biting and unnerving dark comedy that is also effectively a twisted parody of pandering Oscar bait dramas. Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz all deliver career-best performances in this quirky look back at the politics of yesteryear, reminding us that governments have always been rife with squabbling self-serving backstabbers. Whilst The Lobster for me remains Lanthimos’ perfect treatise on his view of humanity, The Favourite is a more-than-worthy companion piece that brings the sleaze and debauchery back to a genre often lacking in it. Rapper Boots Riley makes his feature directorial debut with this wonderfully bizarre dystopian dark comedy that defies reasonable description. Most easily (if reductively) summed up as Brazil for the woke generation, Sorry to Bother You mixes biting socio-political satire and excellent performances from a varied cast with outlandish imagery and imaginative direction. There was no other movie like Sorry to Bother You this year, or in most years for that matter, and I can’t tell you much more than “go watch it” without giving away everything. This is a movie you need to see cold. Black representation in cinema was certainly big this year, but let’s not forget we also had the biggest western film with an all-Asian cast ever this year too, and a really great one at that. Crazy Rich Asians is a classic romantic comedy done right, indulging in the fantasy and glamour of the situation audiences want but also layering it with plenty of smart gags, emotional depth and social commentary. Constance Wu makes for a charming leading lady in the vein of early Julia Roberts, Henry Golding’s star-making turn could charm a hundred snakes at once, whilst Akwafina constantly threatens to steal the show. Can’t wait for the sequels! Melissa McCarthy too often sells herself short with the glut of subpar comedies she puts herself through, so colour me thankful she hasn’t forgotten who good of an actress she can actually be. A witty and filthy caper about forgery and the literary business, Can You Ever Forgive Me? balances comedy and crime expertly and McCarthy’s pathetic yet relatable performance as Lee Israel is a career-best. Richard E. Grant is equally brilliant as her flamboyant accomplice Jack Hock, giving easily his best performance in years, whilst Marielle Heller’s direction is whip smart and captivating. More movies like this please, Mrs. McCarthy! Spike Lee returns to greatness with his best and most approachable film in over a decade, telling the shocking and often even hilarious true-life tale of how a black police officer infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan. John David Washington makes a strong leading man debut as Ron Stallworth, with Adam Driver ably supporting as his sceptical partner, along with Topher Grace in a surprising turn as KKK leader David Duke that will make you both cringe and laugh. With some of the best cringe-inducing comedy around and the most gut-punching final codas to a movie in recent memory, BlacKkKlansman is exactly the kind of movie we need in our racially-fraught climate. How can a franchise keep getting better after over two decades running? It’s the same question we ask every time a new Mission: Impossible movie comes out, and it’s one we may keep asking until Tom Cruise either gives up or dies. Whilst perhaps not the strongest film in regards to plot or character, Fallout wins for simply delivering some of the best action sequences of all kinds in recent memory. Every chase, every fistfight, every daring stunt; all of them shot and directed to as near to perfection you can get. There isn’t a moment in Fallout you will find boring, and I will say it again: how on Earth are they going to top this one? It’s taken a while for Drew Goddard to follow up his feature directorial debut The Cabin in the Woods, but the wait was certainly worth it in my eyes. A character-driven, non-linear multi-strand period neo-noir thriller with an all-star cast and a cavalcade of snappy duologues? It’s practically a film buff’s fantasy. Bad Times at the El Royale certainly takes a few pages from the Tarantino playbook, but moves beyond mere pastiche to say something about not only our past but also our present and possible future; trends and behaviours are cyclical, after all. Definitely the most underrated film of the year, and one I hope eventually finds the cult audience it deserves. Most YA books and their adaptations promote a filtered idea of rebellion and justice, but The Hate U Give skips the allegories and fights the real corruption in this hard-hitting but thoroughly digestible drama. Anchored together by Amandla Stenberg’s breakout lead performance, this film is unabashed in calling out police discrimination, biased media framing, cultural appropriation and casual racism without having to apologise for itself. With films like this and Love, Simon taking YA stories in a more progressive direction, I think this is truly a sign the next generation are to be trusted more than anyone in charge right now. The screenwatch subgenre has seen its fair share of usage, but it’s not caught on in the same way found footage did a decade ago. However, Searching uses the style as more than just a gimmick, telling a simple but gripping thriller mystery with nothing but webcams and Google searches. John Cho’s performance as an apathetic father launched into a desperate quest to find his daughter is a career highlight, and Aneesh Chaganty’s direction perfectly captures the paranoia and uncertainty of the internet age. A sleeper hit easily missed by many, this is one of the few films I can think of that may actually benefit from being watched on a laptop rather than on the big screen. Alfonso Cuaron only graces us with a film every so often, but every time it is so worth the wait. Returning to his routes after several big-budget outings, Roma is a simple but effective slice-of-life drama destined to go down in history as one of the masterpieces of foreign cinema. Featuring phenomenal performances from a cast of unknowns and non-actors, led by an especially heartbreaking turn by Yalitza Apricio, this is easily Cuaron’s most personal film to date. It’s a piece of cinema that, whilst mostly grounded in the mundane, finds the grandeur and cinematic potential in every conceivable moment. Cuaron’s beautiful black-and-white photography is gorgeous and features some of the best shots in cinema this year, and that beauty that makes it so tragic that most audiences (myself included) never got to see this on the big screen. On the plus side, Roma being a Netflix film means you have little excuse to miss out on it. Put aside some time, sit back, and experience the potential cinema still has as an art form.",POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2019","  Since 1996 and over six installments, special IMF (The Impossible Missions Force) agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has been spectacularly ‘figuring things right in the face of danger, often without a plan. In Fallout , Hunt is older and wiser, but definitely not slower. He’s still as slick and smooth, but now he takes time once in a while to pant a little and catch his breath.   ‘Same old Ethan’ is at it again and as the franchise is wont to do, there’s a larger-than-life plot where the world is at stake yet again and only one man can save the day. There’s a thrilling plot, with plenty of delicious subterfuge, one-upmanship and double crossing. But that’s not the lure of a Mission: Impossible  film. Cruise’s highest grossing film series lassos in its fans with a different charm; it’s the death-defying stunts, the pleasurably perfect fitting of implausible puzzle pieces and of course, the actor himself.  Mission: Impossible - Fall OutDirector: Christopher McQuarrieCast: Tom Cruise, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, Henry Cavill, Angela Bassett, Vanessa KirbyStoryline: Terrorist outfit, Syndicate wants to destroy the world with plutonium activated portable nuclear weapons. Agent Ethan Hunt has to once again save the day. Fallout is possibly the best of the six Mission  films, with director Christopher McQuarrie (also behind 2015’s Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation ) upping the ante magnificently. The film’s plot is complicated enough to lull you into a sense of comfort with its slightly arduous first hour. But when things start unravelling, it does so by keeping you constantly at the edge of your seat. No one quite does a chase like Cruise and Fallout  has them all, from an on-foot cat-and-mouse game to speed boats and even cars. Hunt on a motorcycle will give you all the necessary adrenaline to want to ride invincibly against the flow of traffic. And for the final knock-down punch, there’s a helicopter sequence above snow-clad mountains with gunfire thousands of feet in the air.   In Fallout , three plutonium cores will be used to make portable nuclear devices that can destroy the world. To secure them, Hunt has to pluck the leader of terrorist outfit Syndicate, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) off a police convoy. Previous characters like Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) and fellow agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) return. Then there’s the addition of CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill sporting that controversial moustache that got his Superman in trouble in Justice League ).   McQuarrie’s action is superb, at times involving hand-to-hand combat — often with the conspicuous absence of a background score — is intense and potent without the swiftness of an orchestrated and practised attack. Cavill especially shines during his fights, a break from his character’s composed demeanour. It’s easy enough lose yourself in the director’s sleight of hand, but Hunt’s crazy stunts will certainly yank you back to earth. McQuarrie who has also written Fallout , crafts a rewarding blockbuster, succeeding in pushing the envelope with the right dose of humour, an unprecedented amount of action and an explosive bang’s worth of entertainment for your buck.

"Feb 11, 2019"," No one expected Mission: Impossible – Fallout to be bad, but the risk of repetition runs rampant. Any fears that this franchise would flounder without its trademark one-and-done directors can be promptly put to bed – Rogue Nation this ain’t. Christopher McQuarrie’s second shot is a reinvention of his own gold standard, building on the successes and motifs of the five before it and making something new – and better. Not content with making the series’ best instalment (sorry M:I2), McQuarrie and Cruise may have delivered the entire genre’s greatest entry. Once MIF hits screens, Bond and Bourne – both evoked throughout – no longer have a scratch on Ethan Hunt. Ultimate action hero Tom Cruise crushes his performance (and his ankle) in his defining role. Equal parts superman and, somehow, every-man, the relentless drive and energy he puts into this project is clear in every scene. Famed for doing his own stunts, it’s not meant to be this hard to say which of the many, many exceptionally imagined set-pieces is the most impressive – viewers are spoilt for choice. Rebecca Ferguson – one of the best parts of the excellent Rogue Nation – returns in a much reduced role and, however smartly it’s toyed with, the plot can be obvious. These can be forgiven however, for making the longest of six films feel the shortest, jamming it full of action and humour, using exquisite craftsmanship in both look and sound, and giving us Henry Cavill’s moustache. Few films truly deserve to be seen on the biggest screen you can find, but this is certainly one of them. One problem: there is not a screen large enough to contain the eye-popping, heart-stopping spectacle and thrill that is Mission: Impossible – Fallout. This summer’s – year’s – must see marvel.  Moonlighting as a reviewer and editor, I'm more at home with recent films than golden oldies and enjoy appreciating the technical achievements as much as the escapism of the movies. Happy to try any film once, if only for fifteen minutes.

"Feb 6, 2019","[Mission: Impossible - Fallout] once again relies on coherent, well-executed action set pieces, a few moments of winking dialogue and Cruise's complete willingness to hurl himself headlong into harm's way if it might allow him to win our love.",POSITIVE

"Jan 31, 2019"," Tom Cruise is still out here defying the laws of time and space — and “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” proves it. The sixth film in the 22-years-and-counting franchise opens at the box office this weekend to a lot of buzz. This a blockbuster that somehow feels like it’s been two decades in the making; the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre. It is unfettered by such problems as ""logic,"" ""realism,"" or ""physics."" It is two hours of marveling at a man four years shy of 60 doing all his own stunts. It is surprisingly old-fashioned in its message that there are still good people in government who care about the individual welfare as well as the greater good. But to really appreciate this latest impossible mission, one must understand all of the missions that have come before it. The original film was part of an earlier, smaller reboot era during the mid 1990s, when Hollywood mined TV shows from the 1960s and 1970s for big screen fodder. (“The Brady Bunch Movie” was released in 1995, “George of the Jungle” in 1997, “Mission: Impossible” in 1996.) Like the TV show before it, “Mission Impossible” was a spy thriller loosely inspired by James Bond. The film was popular enough to warrant a second installment in 2000, but that felt like the end of the line. And it was, until 2006, when star and producer Tom Cruise decided to reboot the franchise with J.J. Abrams at the helm. (Cruise and his producing partner at the time, Paula Wagner, backed the entire project, and Cruise took a major pay cut to make sure it stayed within budget.) Since then, Cruise has put out a new ""Mission Impossible"" roughly every three years, each of which has slowly improved on the last. This a blockbuster that somehow feels like it’s been two decades in the making; the end result of a slow distillation of the action genre. The problem with action movies in general is that they are fight-first, plot-second endeavors. Many times the story, no matter how simple, is pushed aside to make room for stunt work and combat sequences. “Mission: Impossible,” as a franchise, has had five directors over six films, each of whom has attempt (or hasn't) to solve these issues in their own way. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is notable for being the only film in the franchise with a returning director, Christopher McQuarrie, who helmed the last installment, “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.” McQuarrie’s familiarity with the material, as well as the decision to draw upon the events of the last adventure, makes this film feel less like a standalone project and more like a traditional sequel. Ultimately this is a good thing, because it helps the film balance plot coherence with action, all while maintaining the proper tone. The plot of the movie isn’t that important, and a description of it would sound ridiculous anyway. All viewers need to remember is that Tom Cruise is a good guy, and Henry Cavill is not. Everything else, including characters who flip from bad to good, sometimes in the same scene, is secondary. But as long as the audience remembers that whatever Cavill’s character, the hilariously named August Walker, is doing is bad, and whatever Cruise’s character Ethan Hunt does — even when it makes zero sense — is good, they’ll be able to follow the twists and turns. This binary simplicity also hearkens back to the original TV show’s roots. Launched in the 1960s, it was a show about the good people of the government taking down the bad forces of chaos, maintaining law and order in a world where the social order was rapidly changing. But as cynicism about the American government’s intensions grew, shows that lauded them uncritically decreased in popularity. In order to keep up with the times, the 1996 film finds Ethan Hunt being double-crossed by his government, allowing the agent to be good, but the government to be bad. Over the years, that cynicism has slowly faded. The newest installment ends with a CIA official (Angela Bassett) all but apologizing on behalf of America, having seen the error of her ways, and pledging to help keep governmental institutions honest from now on. If only it were so easy. Believing in the good of complex institutions, like the government, is an important aspect of Cruise’s character. This maybe makes sense, given that in real life, Cruise is one of the world’s most famous believers in institutions some would call questionable. And make no mistake; this is his film. Of course, so has every other “Mission: Impossible” — he’s produced them all. But there’s something uniquely personal about this franchise. Cruise has played a lot of roles over his career, plenty of them award-winning. His time in the spotlight has also been exceedingly rocky. But somewhere around the mid-aughts, it feels like Cruise decided he wanted to spend the rest of his life playing Ethan Hunt. The publicity tour for “Mission: Impossible III” went about as badly for him personally as possible — most people don’t remember now, but his infamous couch-jumping incident  was actually supposed to be in service of his sexy action hero comeback. And yet, Cruise didn't really care how much his reputation suffered or even how much critics like his movies — he was going to make more anyway. The dogged perseverance — rain, shine, or march of time be damned — is also partly why the films keep getting better, as Cruise and company figure out what works and what doesn't. And what works is Cruise-as-stuntman. While superhero films are full of stuntmen and CGI, Cruise’s old-fashioned commitment to doing his own stunts, with as little CGI as possible, lends a real superhero — or at least superhuman — feel to the films. Born in 1962, Cruise is 56 years old. He doesn’t look it, however, as his face seems eternally frozen at 39 ½. This phenomenon — impressive, if a little creepy— is made more obvious by the franchise’s only co-star to last all six movies, Ving Rhames. Rhames, who at 59 is three years Cruise’s senior, looks like a man who has grown too old for this stuff. Not Cruise. Whether running at top speed along rooftops, jumping out of windows, or flying flaming helicopters aimed at Henry Cavill’s face, Cruise’s endurance is extraordinary. But if Cruise is the greatest thing about “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” he’s also its greatest weakness. His character, Hunt, does not have the trading faces-and-actors timelessness of James Bond, because he’s only ever been played by one actor. So while the franchise may have finally hit its stride, its star seems determined to play the lead until he dies. And no matter how good his training regimen (and medical team), the idea that Cruise will be able to keep doing this at 59 or 62 seems like its own mission impossible. On the other hand, with box office estimates predicting Cruise will have the biggest opening weekend of his career — ever — I wouldn't be surprised if audiences and critics are marveling at his stamina once again in another three years.

"Jan 29, 2019"," Under the direction of Christopher McQuarrie, “Mission Impossible - Fallout” is the follow up to “Rogue Nation”. The sixth installment of the MI franchise continues to incorporate Tom Cruise as IMF agent and team leader Ethan Hunt. For the present adventure he teams up with his loyal friend Luther (Ving Rhames), IMF field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and CIA assassin, August Walker (Henry Cavill), hired to control all his moves.  They all engage on a suicide mission in an attempt to dismantle The Apostles, a terrorist group that emerged from the extint The Syndicate, after the capture of its anarchic leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The group is illegally dealing plutonium cores in Europe and Hunt is assigned to retrieve the hazardous material. However, the secret agents fail to accomplish the mission in Berlin when Ethan decides to put Luther’s life in first place, leaving the new director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), in a pile of nerves. With the agent’s double life featured through an encounter with his estranged wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), the film advances at high speed, relying on the tension created by interminable and often overdone motorcycle/car chases that take us to inevitably packed crossroads and confined dead alleys. Besides this, we have supplementary manhunt mania in Kashmir, this time involving a plane and a helicopter; agile physical confrontations; advanced technology methods; and dangerous transactions with sudden ambushes. Co-produced by McQuarrie, Cruise, JJ Abrams (“Super 8”; “Star Trek”; “Star Wars: The Force awakens”), and Jake Myers (“Dunkirk”, “The Revenant”, “Interstellar”), this blockbuster satisfies in its purpose but doesn’t earn the title of ‘impossible to miss’.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 19, 2019","Such will be Cruise's monument, and to quote Watership Down, perhaps it would not have displeased him.",POSITIVE
"Jan 19, 2019"," “Mission: Impossible” is a rare franchise that gets better with age. The trilogy reboot during this decade easily surpasses the previous three. The big, bold and breathtaking ‘Ghost Protocol‘ and impossibly thrilling ‘Rogue Nation‘ are now topped with ‘Fallout.’ While each “Mission Impossible” is typically a standalone movie, ‘Fallout’ is a fallout of ‘Rogue Nation.’ Villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) might have been captured and his Syndicate organization got dismantled, but his network isn’t totally obliterated. His associates have formed Apostles and proceeded with his mission of a new world order; disrupting government structures and creating anarchy through sabotage, strategic assassinations, and mass-annihilation. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise; “Edge of Tomorrow,” “Oblivion,” “Jack Reacher“) failed a mission in Belfast because he refused to sacrifice his team, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg).  Plutonium canisters are now in the hands of the bad guys, which will be used for nuclear bombs. The CIA now gets involved, to the dismay of the secretary of IMF, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Head Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett, “Black Panther”) assigns an agent, August Walker (Henry Cavill, “ Justice League,” “Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice“, “The Man from U.N.C.L.E.“), to accompany the IMF team to recover the canisters. To say that things are not as straightforward is an understatement. There’s arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) tangled in the web and she may or may not be what she seems to be.  British operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, “The Greatest Showman”) shows up, and like in ‘Rogue Nation,’ her intention and allegiance are not always clear. Even the CIA itself is fractured and there may be an enemy within. Layers of twists and turns have always been the hallmark of the “Mission: Impossible” series and it’s something that distinguishes the series from generic action movies. This, and Cruise himself.  He may just be a superspy himself, defying age and limits of the human body.  He continually performs death-defying feats with incredible audacity, vitality, and velocity. After scaling the Burj Khalifa and clinging to the side of an airplane in past movies, he thrusts into a brutal brawl, skydives in a lightning storm, rides a motorcycle sans helmet against Paris traffic, sprints across London rooftops, leaps between buildings, climbs up a rope tied to flying helicopter and free falls onto its cargo, takes control of the cockpit and engages in a heli pursuit in Khasmir, barrels down inside the heli dangling from the mountaintop, and scales a rock face to get to a detonator. See it in 3-D if you can. Close-ups of Cruise doing daredevil acts and clear sweeping panorama make the scenes suspenseful and breathtaking to watch. Christopher McQuarrie (“The Tourist“), the only director invited back a second time in the series, films the scenes with deft direction and precise execution. ‘Fallout’ has multiple crosses, switcheroos, surprises, old-fashioned stunts, relentless pace and total momentum.  It also manages to touch into Ethan’s personal backstory and internal sacrifice he’s made. The personal sacrifice is what enables Ethan Hunt to continue to do what he does. At this point in his life, his relationship with his ghost of a wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan, “Source Code”) is in a good place and he may finally be ready to move on.

"Dec 31, 2018",No movie [this year] delivered spectacle better or more consistently for its running time.,POSITIVE
"Dec 31, 2018"," Fallout brings little that is new to the Mission: Impossible franchise. It also brings everything that is new. It’s not a contradiction as you would assume. To the first point, it follows similar currents that the other films established, such as death-defying missions with death-defying stunts, villains wanting to overturn the current world order, the reliable sidekicks (Pegg, Rhames), the beautiful love interests (Ferguson, Monaghan), and all sorts of psych-outs and last-minute reversals that will make you giddy like Lucille Bluth whenever she’s fooled by Gene Parmesan. Oh, you bet I threw that Arrested Development reference in there on purpose. Don’t knock me for it. As to the second point, well, I think we can all agree Tom Cruise has never flirted with death so closely before. This film makes all his prior stunts look like cakewalks. The HALO jump is, of course, a spectacular set piece in itself, but I was probably more nervous watching him zig and zag through Parisian traffic on that motorcycle. And then scaling that cliffside while nuclear bombs were seconds away from detonating. You know everything will turn out fine, as it always does, but that Ethan Hunt cuts it too close. Combined with Cruise’s unfulfilled death wish, and you’ve got excitement piled on excitement. How did audiences stay in their seats during this? Did they? I could barely stay in mine. While I really do like this (and I really do), the script’s bulk can be felt at certain times. The extended helicopter chase didn’t need to be extended, for instance. It’s the only set piece that I felt dragged on longer than it should have. I also wish they gave Vanessa Kirby’s character a better arc. She seems to be included here as more of a plot device, and considering how good she is whenever she’s onscreen, it’s a shame she’s dropped as soon as her impact is made. It would’ve been neat, for instance, had she taken over Ilsa Faust’s role and was the black-clad assassin on the motorcycle instead of Ferguson. As it is, I hope Kirby is allowed to return for the next one (assuming there will be a next one). Ultimately, my favourite thing about this entry is its heart. The performances from people like Rhames, Ferguson and Monaghan have a purity to them that makes you care about this high-octane extravaganza—and its death-cheating action hero. The thematic preoccupation with a single life being just as important as the lives of millions is also a nice bit of humanism. A touching attribute of Hunt’s that centers why we continually root for him. It’s easy to write it all off as Tom Cruise playing himself, but it’s not that simple. In many ways, Cruise is playing a version of himself that he would like to be. A version that can walk the tightrope of mortality and help those in the most danger. It’s a version that will never translate to the real world, but heck, who cares? Let the man escape death if he wants to. We’ll be watching for as long as he does.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2018"," When it comes to the Mission: Impossible film franchise, there’s the John Woo installment and then there’s all the rest. That is to say, there’s Mission: Impossible II, the sole bad entry in the series, and then there are the other chapters, all of which have been remarkably consistent in delivering high-caliber thrills. This designation includes the sixth and latest picture, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, and it’s hardly a knock to state that it’s not quite as compelling as all the other non-Woo endeavors. It may not ascend to any new heights, but it also won’t send viewers home disappointed. Tom Cruise has spent this series playing Superman rather than Everyman, but here he takes it a step further: His character of Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt is now basically God, lording over his domain, bestowing his blessings on the worshipful mortals around him, and remaining indestructible no matter how hard the Satanic emissaries in his midst try to bring him down. In this entry, Hunt has his hands full trying to retrieve three plutonium cores that were stolen from right under his nose (hey, even God makes mistakes). Negotiations to recover the cores involve releasing master anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, returning from Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation) from imprisonment, a proposition that leaves Hunt queasy. Also thrown into the mix is special agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), ordered by CIA head Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) to tag along with Hunt and his trusted accomplices Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). Clearly, Walker has a hidden agenda, but Hunt is equally as preoccupied with the reemergence of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), returning to the espionage fold in order to take out Lane. Folks not familiar with the M:I series will need a scorecard to keep track of the various characters, but then again, would anybody be foolish enough to join an existing franchise for its sixth installation? Just know that Alec Baldwin returns as IMF Secretary Alan Hunley, Jeremy Renner does not return as IMF agent William Brandt (hey, remember when Renner was briefly being groomed as the new M:I face until Cruise apparently decided he wasn’t ready to put himself out to pasture?), and The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby joins the ensemble as an ebullient black marketer known as the White Widow. Even as far back as Brian De Palma’s original film from 1996, many of the muscular action set-pieces showcased in this series defy belief, and the ones featured in this latest picture dutifully follow suit. Yet the exhilaration they promote provides most of them with a free pass — the same can’t always be said for the vehicular chases, and this movie offers back-to-back dashes that eventually prove wearying. Then there’s the case of Cavill — his character of the mysterious August Walker is intriguing, but he remains such a stiff performer that some of the life is drained from the scenes in which he’s required to convey ambiguity. Ultimately, though, these are minor quibbles when compared to the energy and exuberance flowing through the majority of the picture. Don’t expect any crippling fallout to greet the release of Mission: Impossible — Fallout; on the contrary, it’s safe to assume that a seventh installment is already making its way to the drawing board. Now whether Cruise will remain in the Hunt remains to be seen.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2018"," There isn’t much left to say about “Mission Impossible: Fallout.” While overall it’s not quite as great of a film as you’ve heard, it rates an A+ when it comes to rousing action. The practical stunts are hair-raising, and it’s far and away the best film in the franchise. You likely do not need any convincing to go see this blockbuster, but I will encourage you to head to the theaters immediately to watch this on the biggest screen possible. It’s frantic and fun, setting the bar high for mainstream action films. Featuring what are arguably some of the best action sequences in modern cinema history, the movie is also dazzling to look at with its grand scale cinematography. When the clock starts ticking, there’s a thrilling sense of real danger — especially when Tom Cruise himself is dangling from a helicopter. It’s a visual stunner that isn’t burdened with flashy CGI effects, which in itself is refreshing. Cruise, who famously does most of his own stunts, shows that he’s never too old to be a credible action hero. His Ethan Hunt is flawed, but that only serves to make him more relatable to the rest of us. He’s one of America’s last true movie stars, and he outdoes himself here. The likable supporting players (Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames) are sadly still playing second fiddle, with the exception of Henry Cavill as a tagalong CIA suit. A perfect film it’s not, but it’s awfully easy to overlook the problems (a textbook story, the draggy length, some nonsensical plot holes, Alec Baldwin‘s distracting and shouty non-performance) because this movie is all about one thing: the thrilling action scenes. There are so many that are so well done it becomes impossible to choose a favorite, although I could watch the motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris and the bloody bathroom fistfight scenes once a week and never tire of the artistry in the stunt work. And that’s what audiences will flock to see. The plot doesn’t really play a significant factor in the creative (if mostly unbelievable) story, and its twists grow from “wow, that’s cool” to ridiculous eye-rolling whoppers. No true lover of action films will care, because my review of this movie could easily be nothing more than two words: “buckle up.” Not my type of film Louisa, but you’ve certainly done it justice with your review. I’m sorely tempted. I may send my son a text saying “take a look!” In fact it seems like the type of film I’d be prepared to see at Gold Class (luxury seating). spot on review.  it was predictable at times but I didn’t mind.  Action is an understatement.  Advise your readers that if they do go see this, don’t forget to breathe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2018","Ironically, the most entertaining element of all may be the star's advancing age; Cruise, well into his 50s, scores numerous laughs as the increasingly confused CIA agent, leaping into one spectacular stunt after another and then wishing he hadn't.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2018","The thought crosses the mind: Where can it go from here? The answer is pretty much everywhere. It keeps on going and going, following one exciting sequence with another and then another.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2018"," If you go to a bachelorette party on an island and the other guests put a huge bloody fish head on your pillow, you are in a horror movie, not a rom-com. Maybe at this point in the history of capitalism there’s not much difference. Crazy Rich Asians looks more like a glossy tourist magazine produced for an international economics summit than a movie. While Henry Golding just misses the mark at being an actual Anglo-Asian Cary Grant (maybe next time), Constance Wu, playing an Asian American everywoman, comes off generic, a paper doll dressed first as a professor, then as a Disney princess. Among the too numerous cast, Ronny Chieng and Victoria Loke stand out as a sarcastic, mean-spirited young husband and wife who despise each other, unlike the unmemorable Gemma Chan and Pierre Png, who play a more prominent, unfunny version of the same thing. I would gladly watch an entire movie about Chieng and Loke’s shallow, disrespectful, well-dressed irritants wasting their fortune while struggling to maintain their status. The film is framed by a satirical lecture featuring Alec Baldwin as a John Birch Society racist and documentary footage of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which Heather Heyer was killed by someone who could be this Baldwin character’s grandson. What comes in between is an action-comedy that supposedly takes place in Colorado and mixes together, in standard Spike Lee style, police investigations, black-history lessons, ruminations on genre cinema, and a dismantling of The Birth of a Nation. Complaints that BlacKkKlansman valorizes cops are moot, since this film could not exist without them any more than a Sidney Lumet film like Serpico or Prince of the City could. Just like in those films, the cops here are a rogues’ gallery of New York types, now transposed to Colorado. Their dialogue slips into a version of, “Eyyy, I’m John Turturro’s brother, are we gonna get these Klan scumbags or what?” Adding to this Brooklyn feeling, a triumphant scene takes place in Sunny’s waterfront bar in Red Hook. Lee establishes the scene with Sunny’s red-and-green anchor-and-dolphin neon sign, showing us that this is just one of those nautical-themed saloons you find a county over from the Rocky Mountains. Lee made the didactic BlacKkKlansman to move audiences, which he succeeds in doing despite the feeling that the film has been stitched together from everywhere. If the love scenes between John David Washington and Laura Harrier fall flat (unlike their period hairdos), it’s because they are the bland good people in this movie, which foregrounds actors like Ashlie Atkinson, who plays the self-deluded, racist wife of a Klan goon like she’s a transplant from the Bensonhurst of The Honeymooners. The film works well when Washington puts on his white voice to prank call Klansmen. He aspirates the word white with the precision Diane Keaton brought to the word wheat in Love and Death, without the crutch of being dubbed by a white comic as in Sorry to Bother You. His phone routines could have gone on longer, which would have added to the satiric intensity of the movie more than Alec Baldwin’s slideshow meltdown. Alec Baldwin is everywhere in 2018 as a bigheaded, squinty illustration of American authority’s collapse. In the latest Mission: Impossible movie he returns as Tom Cruise’s boss, the leader of a spy agency more rogue than the CIA. His confrontations with Angela Bassett, as the CIA’s head, are tepid. They distract from Cruise’s epic struggle to maintain his status as an action hero, a fight Cruise wins via grueling stunt work on the roofs of the world. Cruise is a live-action testament to his own ability to take punishment, a kind of human sacrifice. He is undiminished by both time and all the semi-comedy around him, which is the story of his career and his life. Mission: Impossible – Fallout begins with a harrowing dream sequence, like Vanilla Sky. Called into question at his wedding as a failure who puts his loved ones in jeopardy, Cruise spends the rest of the film trying to make up for it by putting random people in danger, up to and including everyone in China, India, and Pakistan — a third of the world’s population and a substantial market for films like this. Everyone who is not in Cruise’s squad is formidable: Vanessa Kirby as a British arms dealer more threatening and coolly appealing than any woman in a recent Bond film; Sean Harris as a Steve Bannonesque alleged mastermind strapped to a chair. Watching Cruise relentlessly pursue and destroy Henry Cavill’s double-crossing CIA hunk, whose dialogue seemed dubbed, was really satisfying. If anyone has earned the right to victory over a British superhero actor twenty years his junior with a porn mustache, it’s the movie star who has managed to avoid the trite universes of DC and Marvel, even if it took being in that mummy film to do it. In the first Equalizer, Denzel Washington played an ex–intelligence agent working at a Home Depot in East Boston, Massachusetts. What made that movie work was how real Washington and director Antoine Fuqua made employment at Home Depot feel, as if someone involved had done time in the PVC pipe and lumber aisles. They had the layout down. The new one starts with Washington disguised as an imam on a train in Turkey, with a big beard, a white skullcap, and black-frame eyeglasses, a look he pulls off better than anyone else in the past thousand years. While this is a change from working at Home Depot, The Equalizer 2 is not quite a Mission: Impossible movie. Soon he is back in Boston, where he now works as a Lyft driver and still lives alone in a small apartment. During one of his shifts, he breaks into the hotel room of a drunken misogynist fare, a finance bro, to teach him and his buddies a lesson. Between the train scene and the Lyft driving, The Equalizer 2 begins with a lot of momentum. It dissipates as attention shifts to Washington’s former spy colleagues. Confrontations with them in a suburban driveway and at a beach house in a deserted seaside town during a hurricane indicate movement away from the working class, toward the kind of real estate ex–intelligence agents are more likely to inhabit. Fuqua stages it all with a kind of Anthony Mann intensity and attention to space, but The Equalizer 2 will probably end up being the only action movie to ever leave me wanting more scenes of the protagonist working for a rideshare app, or at least the only one since Jamie Foxx invented Uber in Collateral. Will (Ben Foster), a veteran with PTSD, and his adolescent daughter, Tom (Thomasin McKenzie), live hard-core off the grid in a state forest in the Pacific Northwest. After yuppie hikers discover their lean-to and report them to the rangers, Will and Tom are relocated to a tree farm in an isolated community with a church and a school. There, Tom is exposed for the first time to people her own age. She makes contact with a dude who looks like a refugee from a Gus Van Sant film, or a guy from a grunge band like the Screaming Trees, a name that makes sense in this context. Tom wants to join 4-H with him so she can learn to take care of animals. Will, however, cannot abide the confinement of the small house he and his daughter have been assigned, nor can he tolerate the war-battle noise of the helicopters that haul away trees to be sold at Christmastime. “We can still think our own thoughts,” he tells Tom when they move in, but the conformity of the simple life blots out thought for him, a man for whom peace of mind is impossible in human society. Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace is the director’s belated return to feature filmmaking after Winter’s Bone in 2010. Like Captain Fantastic from a couple of years ago, but with much more art, grace, and a sense of actual danger — perhaps because it is set among the homeless, perhaps because it was made by a woman — Leave No Trace restates the male Gen-X narrative of protecting children from the outside world and their eventual reintegration into it. For Foster’s Will, there is no redemption, unlike Viggo Mortensen’s character in Captain Fantastic. Will is a permanent exile who turns his back on the world, too damaged to change despite the chances offered him. Foster plays him somber and unlikable, in a performance of confusion and quiet self-righteousness that leads him to expose his daughter to frostbite, rides from truckers, and housebreaking. When Tom finally abandons him, he slinks back into the woods, a hermit turning his back on the film he’s in. Granik pulls away to a God’s-eye view of this figure as he disappears. The enigmatic American filmmaker Rob Tregenza’s last feature film before Gavagai came out twenty years ago. As in Leave No Trace, in Gavagai a man (Andreas Lust) goes into the woods alone. Unfriendly and embittered, he arrives in a remote Norwegian town and hires a driver (Mikkel Gaup) to take him farther north for reasons he doesn’t explain. This is not a road film in which two men wax philosophical and overcome their differences on a journey through the European countryside, like in those Trip movies and TV shows with Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, “from acclaimed director Michael Winterbottom.” Tregenza shoots quiet people in long takes with complicated camera moves. The two men barely speak and never quite bond. Tregenza is not sketching the wistful unhappiness of the moneyed creative class so much as staring into the divide between souls. The man’s journey comes to an end short of his destination. In the rain on a cliff overlooking an expanse of forest, he rips up his late wife’s translations of the Norwegian writer Tarjei Vesaas and flings them into the wind. His anger, destructive and futile, seems to compound his wife’s death by destroying what’s left of her work. Gavagai is a film about the impossibility of closure and the endlessness of grief. The title comes from the analytic philosopher W. V. Quine’s Word and Object, in which Quine invents the word gavagai to use as an example of that-which-is-untranslatable. Tregenza and his coscenarist Kirk Kjeldsen have translated, it seems, the poems of Vesaas into mood and atmosphere. The poems haunt Gavagai in this confrontation with the void. Sometimes they appear in the form of the man’s wife, a ghost who shows up as an awkward memory-in-translation. In the end, the man and the film are both wise to abandon this image and return to life around a fire at dusk. This Belgian genre film, a delirious, unpleasant mash-up of a poliziottesco and a spaghetti western, shot in Corsica, is as violent as it is arty. A heist-gone-wrong set in and around a villa and a cave, it features a cast of treacherous, criminal zeroes, bohemians, and cops, and it doesn’t let up on the violence or the artiness. While adapting Jean-Patrick Manchette novels for the screen is as inevitable as it is desirable, this one seems to exist only as a music video for Ennio Morricone’s score. As a music video, it’s a shocker but too long. As a feature film, it’s pointless and repetitive, especially the squeaking-leather-pants sound effect that recurs over and over again. Manchette’s novels are latter-day séries noires, fast-paced, destructive critiques of capitalism from the era of urban terrorism in Europe. Few of their characters survive. In Let the Corpses Tan none do, and the grimness is not ironic or critical, just maggoty. The film does give off that “I’m on drugs” feel (specifically of bad speed), but it’s so labor-intensive that, like many a trip, it should have ended a long time ago. Elina Löwensohn’s presence as a witchy bisexual and often-nude painter is almost as mysterious as Morricone’s contract must have been. I hope Löwensohn made money, because busy-bee deconstructionists with many-itemed shot lists like codirectors Hélène Cattet and Bruno Forzani should pay their actors by the frame. The cinema is moving in all directions as endless new content crams itself into every available space. This is leading to new kinds of international cross-border weirdness, as films, more than ever, are shot wherever the money is. It’s not just Belgians in Corsica imitating Italians, or Brooklyn playing Colorado, or North Carolina as California, or Toronto and Vancouver as anywhere else. Now, in Mandy, we get Belgium as both the Pacific Northwest and the bowels of hell, starring Nicolas Cage. Emerging from the same cross-contaminated genre swamp as Let the Corpses Tan, Mandy achieves its goals with blunter and larger instruments, which is all the better, because where Corpses fails, Mandy succeeds. If Corpses was a music video, Mandy is a whole doom-metal opera in poisonous Technicolor, with an album cover depicting a landscape of magenta, indigo, and golden-yellow ruins. The film is like that Bell Witch album that only has one ninety-minute-long track. It opens with King Crimson’s “Starless” on the sound track, playing before a clip from a Ronald Reagan speech about “spiritual awakening.” It’s 1983 and Cage, a lumberjack, lives in the woods with his girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough), a weird-fiction fan who works in a tiny country grocery store and speaks like Patti Smith reading the poem at the beginning of “The Revenge of Vera Gemini” — a British person’s version of unaffected Americanness. Riseborough’s slight New Jersey inflection points to where Mandy lets in real life. One of the film’s principle pleasures is that for all its splashy-morose color schemes and arty dissolves, its death cult maintains the feeling of unemployed oafs from Neptune, New Jersey, worshipping Satan in Ramapo Mountain State Forest. The film is pure acid trip with a macaroni-and-cheese commercial thrown in. (TV commercials are the worst thing to see on hallucinogenic drugs.) Cage howls in pain and screams in despair, breaking out in occasional intelligibility only to say things like, “Don’t be negative.” By the end, as a grimy, wounded Cage stands with a chain saw in front of a burning car and still hasn’t avenged his girlfriend or saved anyone else from the drug-addicted demons/private-press recording artists, it becomes obvious what director Panos Cosmatos has delivered here: a parody of “the hero’s journey” on par with Kanye West’s use of that phrase in the Oval Office while describing Donald Trump to himself. Panos Cosmatos knows a lot of things about making movies, including that you show the burning cars. And yet he’s no Lee Chang-dong, who fails to fully reveal a burning Porsche that’s an important plot point in his new film. Lee does show Donald Trump, however, on a TV in the protagonist’s apartment, using the original Cheddar Goblin to add to the sense of unease in this unique serial-killer mystery. And unlike Let the Corpses Tan, Burning raises actual questions about money and its effects on people’s lives. Burning, like Psycho and L’avventura, starts off as a film about a woman, Hae-mi (Jeon Jong-seo), who appears to be its subject and star. While working her job hawking cell phone accessories in a miniskirt, she reconnects with Jong-su (Yoo Ah-in), a poverty-stricken aspiring writer she knew in high school. After they hook up, she leaves for a solo trip to Africa and returns with a new friend, Ben, played by the American actor Steven Yeun in a subtle, nuanced performance that shifts between friendly-classy and “I’m a secret arsonist.” Ben is a young member of Gangnam’s idle class, and neither Hae-mi nor Jong-su fit in there. After Hae-mi begins to date Ben, she disappears again. Jong-su quizzes Ben about her absence and slowly comes to realize something isn’t quite right with this slick, fashionable dude who starts reading Faulkner because Jong-su mentioned him, one of the film’s slyest condemnations of rich-person poaching. Burning refuses to reveal what actually happened to Hae-mi, or what kind of person Ben really is, if he is any type at all, which leaves Jong-su in a terrifying moral limbo. All three of the film’s main characters are dispensed with by Lee in this unsentimental movie that shows human connection as fragile and masked when the friends are unequal. Hae-mi, dismissed from the film the earliest and seemingly with ease, in a way gets off the easiest of these characters, because there’s no way to know what happened to her. She’s kooky and a searcher but also just an innocent victim. But of what? With the men it’s all too clear. Cinephiles in New York have noted the difference between how 2018 began and how it is ending. In January it was possible to see a movie a day in almost any theater for $9.99 a month using MoviePass. It was possible to stream thousands of classic and foreign films at home through FilmStruck for about $8 a month. Now, out of the blue and with little explanation, but as the result of its monopolistic deal with AT&T, Time Warner has shut down FilmStruck. MoviePass still exists, but barely. For a while it managed to do something that seemed impossible: it changed theatrical exhibition for the better. Now it has (more predictably than the shuttering of FilmStruck, it must be said) become some new kind of con in which only the most mediocre and longest-running movies are available to see, and only three a month. Suddenly we are plunged into a world of $16 movies at theaters in a city with no video stores. The cancellation of both services, at this point, seems like the end of the long tail. The blockbuster model has reasserted itself and as usual seeks to muscle everything else out of the way. At the height of corporate capitalism you pay full price for bad movies improperly projected in ugly theaters whose business is selling large sodas at a 1,000 percent markup. If you want to watch a movie at home, there’s Netflix, now mostly a streaming television service, or Amazon. It’s all an insult to cinephiles and to film history. Going mass means living in the moment and throwing away what came before. The moment is crap. To rub it in, the large theatrical chains have implemented reserved seating policies, which, by slowing down ticket buying at the box office, herd filmgoers into making electronic purchases for which they have to pay an additional fee. Reserved seats are antithetical to moviegoing, which traditionally and democratically has been first come, first served. You could move to a different seat if a weirdo (or anybody) was sitting too close. This new nonegalitarian system is fancy and inappropriate. It takes too long and it huddles people together. Let’s just go to the opera at this point, instead of seeing The Girl in the Spider’s Web pinned in place next to someone texting “wyd?” Meanwhile the ads shown before movies have gotten more aggressive about copping to how terrible and disgusting their products are. The one for Diet Coke with Netflix actress Gillian Jacobs is a masterpiece of the passive-aggressive come-on. “Look,” Jacobs begins, like a pundit on a TV news show, “here’s the thing about Diet Coke: life is short.” As well as nasty and brutish. Next she implores people who want to live in yurts to “yurt it up” and “just do you.” Yurt dwellers may not drink Diet Coke, but they still have rights. She concludes with a simple confession: “Diet Coke: because I can.” Has freedom of choice ever seemed less appealing? At least that particular ad wasn’t made by a film student. The worst, most dystopian Coke ads shown in theaters — each one a little nightmare from a society that has gone full Clockwork Orange — are now also promos for higher education. They are contests that inculcate their lucky film-student winners into a world of meta-shilling, where the theatrical experience is reconfigured as an excuse to slurp Coke under dim lights. Doing that is so satisfying that the actors on-screen envy the soda guzzlers in their cushy seats with cup holders and reach out to grab their giant sodas. This kind of audience flattery is a form of permission to use cell phones while the movie is on. If the actors are just dorks like you who need a Coke so bad, there isn’t any need to pay attention to them. When I went to see Crazy Rich Asians my date and I sat next to three other couples in a row with eight seats. The young women in the other couples texted throughout the movie (which was sold as an important cultural event) while their boyfriends, careful not to mess up a date, sat passively and stared at the screen as if their girlfriends were watching the movie with them instead of paying attention to other people who weren’t there. I saw an Ingmar Bergman film at the Museum of Modern Art recently, where I was seated one row over from a family of four. The father texted throughout the first half hour of the movie, impervious to the nearby MoMA regulars hissing at him to stop. When they began turning around, jabbing their fingers in his face, and threatening to take his phone, he stood up, grabbed his children’s hands, and marched out of the theater in a huff, his wife trailing behind. Somehow, he had been wronged. Similarly, at the New York Film Festival screening of Burning, a man seated a couple of rows ahead of me texted on and off for the first twenty minutes of the film until someone got an usher to shine a flashlight in his face and threaten to remove him. I understand why the texters went to see Crazy Rich Asians. I do not understand what they were doing at MoMA and the New York Film Festival. It’s true that excellent new theaters that show good movies have opened, and are opening, in New York City. They sell discount cards, and anyway, there are many different ways to see movies, some of them legal, without FilmStruck and MoviePass. But cash outlays for those discount cards are not small and the prices without them are steep. And when Venom came out last month to universal pans and no human being who liked it could be found anywhere, it still cleaned up at the box office. It’s still playing. I looked just now and it has passed $200 million in ticket sales. It must be a great movie for texting. A journey to the end of the night set in Los Angeles, like Faces, Wobble Palace is an anti-rom-com of debasement. Unlike Faces its characters are petulant, underemployed young whiners instead of confused, middle-class, middle-aged drunks. Times have changed in Los Angeles. No longer Cassavetes’s city of nice houses with big dining rooms, Wobble Palace reveals LA living as downscale and codependent, even in open relationships. Scrolling text messages take up part of the frame sometimes and add to Wobble Palace’s mood of smarmy irritation. One gets used to them on-screen, where they are better than in the audience, but not to the artificial click-click sound of the keys. Put your shit on silent. The Halloween night 2016 setting aids the film, as writer-director-star Eugene Kotlyarenko goes full Herzog’s Nosferatu as his costume choice for the scenes before the final breakup. It’s more flattering than the “fat Skrillex” look he is accused of sporting earlier. Costar and cowriter Dasha Nekrasova also gets to say things like “We’re gonna have our first female president soon” in her distinctive world-weary drone of postironic predisappointment. Like Viva’s bored drawl in the late 1960s Warhol films and in Varda’s LA-set Lions Love, Nekrasova’s voice is the voice of a generation — in tone at least. It is so distinctive I wish she would record the service interruption announcements on the subway so that the true sound of the stalled and waiting would come through the speakers. “No Drama” is posted as rule No. 1 for the servers at the Hootersesque restaurant in strip-mall Texas where Support the Girls takes place. Andrew Bujalski highlights his film’s commitment to that as a concept, even as star Regina Hall, as the restaurant’s manager, admits that banning drama is impossible with her half-dressed staff of twentysomething women. But when they get too provocative, she reminds them, “We are mainstream! We are mainstream!” Drama is mainstream, porn is not. Mumblecore isn’t either, so Bujalski, who is now one of the best directors of actors in American filmmaking, has designed this unique, low-key film as a vehicle for Hall, the excellent actress from the Think Like a Man and Scary Movie movies who was overshadowed by the discovery of Tiffany Haddish in Girls Trip. While the film descends into a bar-top riot and ends with women drinking and screaming in rage and frustration on a roof, it is men who are more likely to violate the “No Drama” rule. The restaurant owner (James Le Gros), for instance, subjects a captive Hall to his pointless fury as they speed in his truck, with boat attached, to pursue another driver who has annoyed him on the road. When Hall and her staff move over to a corporate chain restaurant called Man Cave, an HR manager, played with polished friendliness by Brooklyn Decker, reveals the true drama of our time. “We’ve built this super-well-thought-out culture of respect,” she explains, “and we have a whole team of attorneys who are paid a crazy amount to make sure we lay that out clearly.” Like the manager she plays, Hall is a team player to the end. I’m not sure the ensemble cast doesn’t overshadow her. Lea DeLaria as Bobo, a dyke regular at the bar, steals every scene she’s in. Shayna McHayle, a.k.a. the Brooklyn rapper Junglepussy, draws attention away from everybody else with nothing more than baleful stares and a self-contained sick-of-it-all attitude. If someone put McHayle and Dasha Nekrasova in a movie, they would become a bored, indie Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder, at least for South by Southwest and Bushwick, if not the mainstream. Ron Rice’s last film, unfinished at the time of his too early death, is an essential document of bohemian New York City in 1963 as it was lived and thrashed in cheap apartments and on the streets. Taylor Mead, its star, the ultimate weird boho-hipster of the second half of the 20th century, finished a final cut of The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man in 1981 after having screened other versions around the world for almost two decades. Mead’s version has now been restored by Anthology Film Archives. The film’s black-and-white images demonstrate what the camp/avant-garde nexus meant in the Manhattan of Andy Warhol, Jill Johnston, and Frank O’Hara. The film was shot a year before Sontag’s “Notes on Camp” was published, but Rice’s movie is a living, breathing, leg-humping enactment more amusing, friendly, and connected to daily life than Jack Smith’s Flaming Creatures. Smith, one of Sontag’s inspirations, appears in the movie and almost takes over its second half from the coy, shier Mead and from Winifred Bryan, the implacable, overweight black woman who is the Queen of Sheba to Mead’s Atom Man. The film, having established the bizarre relationship between these two mismatched oddballs, can’t stray too far from them no matter who piles on. The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man should be projected twenty-four hours a day somewhere in Manhattan, so that before we’re all pushed into the sea off Rockaway Beach people can be reminded of the strange form of life that once lived here. It turns out that self-conscious cinematic camp was not exactly invented by Jack Smith in New York. In an unimposing suburban home in Pacific Palisades, California, Jerry Lewis, unbeknownst to the avant-garde, had begun in 1951 to shoot black-and-white movie parodies and pre-Warholian color screen tests during his nights and weekends off from Paramount Pictures, where he and Dean Martin were employed as the nation’s most popular comedy duo. Shown only once to friends at premiere parties at the same house where they were filmed, Lewis’s Gar-Ron productions (named for his sons) remained unseen by anyone else until this past October, when the Lewis estate and the Library of Congress debuted them at the Museum of Modern Art. These films, which combine borscht belt humor and Mad magazine–style parody with vulgar put-downs and gay panic, reveal Lewis as a comic auteur and “total filmmaker” almost ten years before his official directorial debut, The Bellboy. The Gar-Ron movies, like The Queen of Sheba Meets the Atom Man, also document their time and place, which in this case is the sunny Southern California of Hollywood movie stars partying at home. If you had been waiting to hear Dean Martin, Janet Leigh, Tony Curtis, or Shelley Winters utter words like orgasm, cock, shit, and vomit, your wait was over if you made it to MoMA this past fall. The series combined featurettes, shorts, and home movies from this period in which Jerry Lewis and America were both on the rise. Lewis’s well-known neuroticism and aggressiveness are less hidden and more integrated in these productions than in the Freudian constructs Paramount put together for him and Dean, or in the later work for which he was solely responsible. In fact, these movies present a happy Jerry, not the lugubrious interviewee America got to know from his films in the 1960s, after he became an auteur and a philanthropist. One home movie, shot at a 1920s-themed jazz party in the Lewis rec room, is positively giddy, with Lewis and Patti, his wife, and Curtis and Leigh doing the Charleston in boaters, spats, and flapper outfits late into the night. The films themselves present popular movies of the day in “Jewish” versions. Sunset Boulevard becomes Fairfax Avenue, the story of a handsome young delivery boy (Curtis) from a kosher deli forced to write a screenplay for a washed-up star of the silent screen (Leigh, caked in face powder). In Come Back Little Shiksa, Martin is a doctor “struggling to avoid sobriety.” Each is like a Kuchar brothers film with big stars in it, too weird and offensive for TV sketch comedy, an emanation from a hip demimonde that only existed in Lewis’s house when Curtis and Leigh dropped by. The Milton Berle screen test, which poses Uncle Miltie against a bright-red backdrop as it scrutinizes his face so Lewis can pepper him with rude, absurd questions off-screen, is more out-there than any Warhol screen test. I’d say it’s one of the best films of the 1950s, and it clearly demonstrates Lewis’s way with color and his ability to capture stylized discomfort on-screen. In the MoMA lobby between Jerry Lewis screenings, a basketball-stomached older man wearing a large newsboy cap introduced himself to me as Slaps Donovan. He cornered me to tell me he used to be the film critic on Jackie Mason’s radio show. Now he had a Broadway play and a reality TV series he was developing. “Hal Prince,” said Slaps, “has my play on his desk, but he’s booked up for the next three years.” This play, a musical, takes place during the Woodstock rock music festival in 1969, but doesn’t use any of the songs. It’s all new, original music that Slaps has written. His TV show, Celebrity Séance, involves unsuspecting contestants speaking to famous dead people through the medium of Slaps’s voice impressions, which he will provide off-screen. At the very moment Slaps asked me, in the voice of Jerry Lewis, about getting some nookie, I got a text on my phone. A woman I know who works for Netflix was in town for the New York Film Festival. She was inviting me to meet her and two filmmakers for dinner at a fancy restaurant near Lincoln Center. While Slaps imitated Jerry Lewis and I looked at this text on my phone, a Brazilian artist named Romero Britto walked by dressed in a multicolored homemade suit and stopped to pose for photos fans of his wanted to take with him. The clowns had been sent in, and I was among them. I couldn’t go to dinner. There was another Jerry Lewis movie in half an hour that I planned to see, and besides I wasn’t dressed for that kind of thing. If I had gone to meet my friend and two glamorous strangers, I would have become the Slaps of the dinner, explaining how I was a film critic. That night, instead, I had committed myself to the bizarre and the asinine. Slaps exited onto 53rd Street, still doing his Jerry Lewis voice, and I went and sat down in the lobby to wait for the next show. A lady in a burgundy tracksuit sitting across from me pulled a container of macaroni salad out of a crinkly plastic shopping bag, pried off the clear plastic lid, and began eating it with a big metal soup spoon she had brought with her to the museum. At least I wasn’t wearing a funny hat. A truer séance of dubbed voices, forgotten faces, and witchy art, Orson Welles’s The Other Side of the Wind brings a lost work back to life. By the time of his death in 1985, Welles had been working on the film for fifteen years and hadn’t finished it. Now it arrives complete, fully formed, a masterpiece and a shock to the system, courtesy of Netflix and all the money they have to burn. It is not a fragment like Welles’s It’s All True or Don Quixote. It is done. Never has a movie been as overwhelmed by the history of its production as this one, “this circus of scattered souls . . . a desperate venture shared by desperate men.” That doesn’t matter anymore. The desperate men and the scattered souls are now on the screen. Near the beginning of the film, a busload of partygoers on the way to the desert house of the film director Jake Hannaford (John Huston) passes a drive-in theater where the huge marquee advertises two movies: i eat your skin and i drink your blood, fitting titles for this exposé of Hollywood vampirism. It’s filmed alternately like Zabriskie Point, random Eurotrash, Kenneth Anger–ian avant-gardism, 1970s porn, Cassavetes, and cinema verité. Like Faces it is another SoCal journey to the end of the night; like the Jerry Lewis home movies, it inhabits a vulgar-sophisticated world of homosexual panic, here partially masked by lots of naked hippie hetero sex in a steam bath, in a moving car, and on a back lot in Hollywood, abandoned and in ruins. In The Other Side of the Wind, Welles purposefully synthesized every film style that had come along since the late 1950s, in a bid for relevance the film mocks when Hannaford is accused of doing the same. Where Hannaford crashes and burns, Welles succeeds with brilliance, adding to the sense of tragedy surrounding the film. It should have come out in its time. The film swings wildly between tones and tempos, black-and-white and ultravivid color. Michel Legrand’s score and the other music in the film add to this. In the psychedelic film-within-a-film, Blue Cheer dominates the soundtrack like Can tried to at the beginning of Inherent Vice. In the party scenes, we hear the hip jazz pianist Jaki Byard, his music piped in as drunks spill booze on each other and sing “Glow Worm” in a haunting scene lit only by candles. The film was cowritten by Welles’s companion, Oja Kodar, who also costars. She is often nude and plays a mute Native American who is mocked as “Pocahontas” while an underage blonde girl (Cathy Lucas), a nonactor in an archie bunker for president T-shirt, is passed from Peter Bogdanovich, as a director in the flush of success, to Huston’s Hannaford, a director who can’t get his film made in the New Hollywood of the time. It’s a sick, glorious movie that ends at another drive-in, a graveyard of the cinema with a train running past it, where Kodar, projected on the screen, stabs with scissors at these men’s fantasies and dreams. n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year.

"Dec 7, 2018"," Wow! I don’t even know where to start. For a series of films built pre-eminently on incredible action set pieces and a penchant for self-one-upmanship with Tom Cruise at the lead, you know that Mission: Impossible – Fallout was designed from day one to be a wild ride. How effective of one would it be? That was really the only question. It’s corny to say it, but the series already did a couple films ago, so I guess I have permission: “Mission Accomplished!” Defying all conventional Hollywood wisdom, the sixth installment of this series is very well the best one yet, and I say “yet” because, at this rate, I don’t doubt Cruise will muster up the fervor to continue these until he looks like Jim Phelps in his last installment. Why do I believe this? Let’s dig in. As this film functions as a complete extension of the last film (also directed by the series’ first repeat-director, Christopher McQuarrie), we open with an extension of Rogue Nation‘s interesting opening. Just as that film featured the mission briefing delivered to Ethan Hunt (Cruise, advancing the characterization beyond the action-hero cypher of film’s past) through an antiquated method (record player), this film delivers it with the churning and whirring of a gearbox, reminding us of the analog nature of why we love these films. Among the deluge of digital playgrounds that fill cinemas on a weekly basis, there is a respite in knowing that IMF agent Ethan Hunt can always find ways to thrill us with the oomph that can only come from practical stunt work. The Syndicate that has been slowly building and manipulating behind the scenes globally has morphed into a new form: the Apostles, and as the name implies, there is a religious fervor to usurping the world order. While gamers might connect the film’s title to the video game series of Fallout by name alone, that connection does actually work: recovery of plutonium cores that are set to power three nuclear explosives is what gets the incredibly powerful and efficient machine that is this film going. As trailers show, Solomon Lane (played again through chilling whispers by Sean Harris), the villainous mastermind of the Syndicate, is a part of the Apostles’ plans. Hunt and crew find themselves caught in the middle of incredible forces that could very easily destroy life globally and end theirs personally. Divulging much more will unlock the secrets that should only be revealed through viewing. There’s a hypnotic energy to this film’s pacing. The sheer number of impressive action set pieces is incredible, and while everyone will remember Cruise climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol, here, we may very well have one of the best choreographed and edited action films of all time. That film centered around that incredible sequence, but here, we have an almost beginning-to-end steam train of pure movie magic that hits hard and doesn’t stop. Dialogue and plot act as moments to catch our breath, but even in the midst of action sequences, the storytelling continues in creative ways. While I am a lover of Daniel Craig‘s series of James Bond films, Quantum of Solace, in particular, got lost in the editing room with some of its action sequences (thereby leaving audiences dazed and confused). Such things are never an issue here. Yes, the camera finds itself placed in ways that just shouldn’t be possible, but the shots it captures always reinforce the spatial layout of everyone and everything. Even as it was all thrilling, never was I lost in what was going on, and after years of critiques in action filmmaking, hopefully, this film will be a lesson to all other films to come. Punches land here with power, crashes are felt, and, all-in-all, the energy runs high. There are many reasons Henry Cavill was cast here as Agent August Walker, a tag-along assigned to work with Ethan, due to CIA oversight from their new director (Angela Bassett). The primary one being is that he is a beast on-screen. In the expertly crafted “bathroom fight scene” shown heavily in trailers, he seems to reload his arms, and I believed it. The effectiveness of this film as an action film can’t be overstated, and I haven’t even gotten to the twists and turns of the plot. While this film felt less “fun” or “funny” than the last two, it all happens out of necessity. The stakes have never felt higher, and with a larger team of people we genuinely care about, I was fully wrapped up in everything happening to everybody. The plot has always somehow seemed secondary in these series of films, but McQuarrie, in particular, has elevated it to a higher priority in Rogue Nation and now here. In my opinion, he crafts his two films to be a full realization of what the series always could be, even after its inconsistent start with earlier films. As the marketing stills show, colors seem muted here throughout, but I believe it makes the colorful moments in the film like the HALO jump and subsequent nightclub scene look even better as a result. I’ve yet to talk about Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), but she returns with an interesting plot thread. This film delves into the themes of the greater good and personal justice in a multitude of ways, and she is just one of the many ways that’s all unpacked. Ethan Hunt is given the opportunity to hone his moral code here by the situations that come, and as a result, he becomes a far better character overall. The danger dampens the opportunities for humor, as mentioned, but Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) get chuckles right when we need them. Also worth mentioning is how this film finds great ways to incorporate plot elements from the entire series here, a true first in a series that has felt so disjointed. Alongside that, I felt genuine emotion towards the end with character interactions rooted in long-running plot developments from earlier films. That kind of emotion only comes with films connected by plot, and I’m so glad that the series has embraced it. Content-wise, the violence hits hard, but there is nothing gratuitous to me or unnecessary. Everything feels real, and as a result, gore or death isn’t glorified. I was disappointed in the F-Bomb delivered here, and considering who gives it and his other well-known film role, it felt cheap and unnecessary to me. Sexual content is completely a non-factor here, which is interesting in a spy film. The terrorist group being named the Apostles and their planned attacks on the world’s Holy Cities ties the film to the Bible, but it doesn’t explicitly go any deeper than that. I am authoring a Geeks Under Grace Bible Study for the film, and I plan to go into the themes of providence and the sanctity of life; check it out once it is published. Overall, I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It’s satisfying on so many levels. In a summer of Thanos and dinosaurs, it’s quite a testament that of all those films, I think I had the strongest compulsion to re-watch this. If you have even had a passing interest in any of the preceding films in the series at all, you owe it to yourself to catch up to this one and experience the thrill ride it offers. It is a further perfecting of what the series can deliver, and kudos to Cruise to continuing to find new ways to put himself into the ire of insurance companies everywhere, doing things no sane person would attempt. The meticulous direction from McQuarrie has me hoping that he and Cruise work out a deal for him to continue directing this partnership until jumping or hanging from any high point is…well, impossible. With the series being this good this far into itself, long live Ethan Hunt!",POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2018"," It is common knowledge that Tom Cruise broke his ankle while shooting a scene where he jumps from roof top to roof top during a foot chase. The consummate professional, and filled with astounding mental fortitude, Cruise manage to finish the scene as planned despite the injury. The broken ankle would have been the main story of the production for any other film, but Tom Cruise is no ordinary actor and Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no ordinary film. As one observes in the special features of the film’s Blu-ray, the broken ankle was the least of everyone’s concerns. Tom Cruise was literally one wrong move away from serious harm in every single one of the stunts he performed in the film. Making the sense of danger in the final product even more captivating. In this installment Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) find themselves battling the remnants of Solomon Lane’s (Sean Harris) Syndicate, now called the Apostles, as they search for three stolen plutonium cores. The cores are of particular interest to a mysterious individual known as John Lark who intends to use the plutonium to finish the work Lane started. Not trusting that Hunt’s team can complete their mission, the CIA sends one of their top agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill), to ensure that the items are retrieved by any means necessary. Complicating matters further is the fact Hunt needs Lane to find Lark and the plutonium, while former ally Isa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is tasked with ensuring that Lane is silenced once and for all. One of the year’s best films, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is one of those rare sequels that surpasses the films that came before it in the series. It is an edge of your seat thrill ride that manages to top itself with each action sequence without sacrificing the story in the process. Christopher McQuarrie’s direction feels especially assured this time around. Unlike most modern action filmmakers, McQuarrie places the practical stunts at the forefront, and uses special effects to enhance them rather than the other way around. This allows Cruise and the rest of the cast, Henry Cavill is a great addition as the rough around the edges Walker, to raise the stakes in a palpable way. The Blu-ray, which arrives in stores tomorrow as part of a Blu-ray/DVD/Digital combo pack, courtesy of Paramount Home Media Entertainment, is packed with special features that are just as riveting as the film itself. The standout is “Behind the Fallout” which consists of seven featurettes that breakdown how every action sequence was filmed. Take for example “Top of the World” that highlights just how grueling and dangerous it was to create and shoot the Halo jump; or “Rendezvous in Paris” in which the cast and crew discuss how Paris became a key component of several action sequences including the Arc de Triomphe motorcycle chase.",POSITIVE
"Nov 25, 2018"," Mission Impossible: Fallout is the type of film that invites viewers into the action. From an epic skydiving scene to a helicopter chase, the camera focuses in on its main actors — especially Tom Cruise — as they complete incredible stunts right in front of us. Cruise performed many of his character’s stunts himself, proving himself to be an undeniably ambitious action star and showing audiences what great action sequences can look like. This is one of the many things that makes director Christopher McQuarrie’s new film stand out. Despite Fallout serving as the sixth entry in the long-running cinematic franchise, the film feels like a unique feat. For fans of the franchise, many of the key elements of those stories return here. There are plenty of deceptions here — the masks return in a big way —alongside a few smart twists and welcome surprises. But there’s also some great character arcs here as well that raise the emotional stakes. In this installment, a failed mission leads to a horrific predicament. A group of terrorists aligned with the imprisoned Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) steal a shipment of plutonium. Lane, who served as the head of the terrorist organization known as the Syndicate in Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, returns to the forefront here as his allies take on Hunt’s team. In order to recover the plutonium, Hunt’s team must engineer a trade with an enigmatic broker known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). The storyline sets up intricate action sequences pitting Hunt and allies such as CIA operative August Walker (Henry Cavill) against Lane’s criminal network. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns too as an MI6 operative with her own agenda. McQuarrie, who directed and co-wrote Rogue Nation, returns to the helm in this new instalment and serves as the writer and director once again. As Oscar winner for penning the Usual Suspects screenplay, McQuarrie knows how to keep a complicated script tight and does so here. The dialogue is set up nicely, with short early scenes establishing the story quickly without losing the film’s energetic pace. When it comes to the action, McQuarrie keeps his camera focused on the action itself. Instead of pulling the camera back, he leans the camera in — keeping the intensity high while showing the action (and his actors) up close. The script itself offers plenty of strong dialogue with Simon Pegg offering up some great one-liners once again as Benji Dunn and Ving Rhames offering a more subtle turn as Luther Stickell. Beyond that, there’s an emotional importance to the proceedings with a delicate storyline featuring Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan) and Faust. Julia, Hunt’s wife, was absent in the last installment so it’s great to see her return as an important supporting figure here. The status of Hunt’s relationship with her and Hunt’s growing bond with Faust add a depth to these characters and to their overall arcs. It also ties this newest installment nicely together with some of the earlier films. This isn’t a franchise where each of the installments stands alone (unlike many of the James Bond pictures, for instance). The newer films here add layers to the existing characters and build them up in each installment and that’s undeniably the case here. Mission Impossible: Fallout builds on the past storylines but weaves its own unique narrative. It keeps this series going strong with a capable Tom Cruise leading the way — and showing off his incredible skills — and McQuarrie guiding this series forward. Featuring tremendous action sequences, smart dialogue and an emotional depth, this film is one of the best action movies of the year.",POSITIVE
"Nov 16, 2018"," I love the rubber masks, ripped off to reveal someone else entirely underneath, though I was also secretly hoping they would keep ripping mask after mask off each other until all that was left was a collection of tiny pinhead people. The masks also added a Scooby Doo ambience, and faced with a perfectly innocent character at the end I was fully expecting someone to rip off the guy’s face and the revealed villain to declare he would’ve gotten away with it if it wasn’t for those pesky kids. I say kids, the team (Cruise as Ethan Hunt, Ving Rhames as Luther, Simon Pegg as Benji) are all getting on a bit. Cruise is, after all, 56 now. That other American trademark, the Giant Redwood, is only 3444 years older. It would be understandable if he occasionally felt a little creaky jumping out of a window, or let out an involuntary “aaahhh!” or “ooohhh!” as he manauvered his way into the pilot’s seat of an in-flight helicopter, after climbing up a long swinging rope mid-air. But he keeps going, driving the action forward. Mission Impossible: Fallout is relentless, its action scenes going on longer than you think possible while still being knuckle-chewingly exciting. Cruise is its beating heart – amiably taking the piss out of himself while throwing himself into literally death-defying stunts. Ethan Hunt is ageing, physically knackered, and emotionally weary. It’s actually a rather moving portrayal. Even the potential sort-of love triangle between Hunt, Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunt’s ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) doesn’t go beyond the odd intake of breath and sad glance as everyone’s so very nice, and probably a bit tired. Cruise has been around for so long that I’ve adored him, then gone off him, then adored him again about 15 times. I even remember him in Risky Business, the film that sent sales of tooth veneers and London Underground season tickets rocketing (I might as well also admit that to me, Alec Baldwin will always be the blue-eyed sexpot from Knots Landing). Not only is the action believably human (in a truly unbelievable way, obviously), and fallible – it’s also funny. There’s a terrific extended chase sequence with Hunt running across the London skyline – along the tops of buildings, through offices and sliding down tiled roofs – while Benji, directing him left right, left right, in his pursuit from the ground, doesn’t realise he’s up in the air. It’s only when Ethan pauses and Benji questions it – presumably he thought Ethan was waiting for a pelican crossing to turn green – and Ethan barks he’s waiting to jump out of a window, that he twigs. The plot, as far as I could understand before it got too muddy, centres on some missing containers of plutonium, which Hunt previously failed to rescue after choosing the lives of his team instead (and if that’s not on the next philosophy A’Level paper in a discussion of rule utilitarianism then it should be). This idea that Hunt feels himself forced to continue his work because he can is a big theme here and as near as it gets to real thoughtfulness; not so much arrogance as the belief that he’s personally letting down individuals and the world if chooses a quiet life. And despite its many threads, director Christopher McQuarrie has ensured you don’t have to have seen the series to enjoy this one. There’s quite a lot of explanation, even if I didn’t always understand it all. The unremitting action needs no prior knowledge; and the warm relationships among his team, while they may have been built up during previous films, are easy to appreciate and enjoy. The plutonium search takes in first the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) a fake philanthropist and genuine arms dealer; if Hunt can spring imprisoned American agent turned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who is about to be transported across Paris in a prison van, he can then swap him for the plutonium via her contacts. (Or not swap him, as of course he and Lane have History; but get the plutonium back anyway.) Oh and Hunt is pretending to be John Lark, another terrorist, and later he’s framed to make the CIA think he really is Lark, gone rogue. Isla Faust is in Paris too, just to add to the merry reunions. Keeping an eye on Hunt for the CIA is August Walker (Henry Cavill, perfectly cast!). He spends the first half of the film always slightly behind Hunt and the second half slightly in front. He’s ruthless, and extremely snarky (I’ve just checked my cinema notes and I actually wrote “Walker is a cocky bugger” so you can rest assured that was my first impression). He’s funny and fit during that already-famous restroom fight scene between him, Hunt and He Who May Or May Not Be Lark (Liang Yang), as sparkly glass shatters, silver pipes are ripped from walls and the pristine shiny-white cubicles become drenched in blood. There’s a puppyish keenness too. “Hope is not a strategy” Walker says pompously, to which Ilsa replies dryly “you must be new”. (A feature of Fallout is how much of the action is not just seat-of-pants, but made-on-the-hoof, as planning goes out of the window and instinct and ever-reducing options take precedence.) I’m not going to lie, I rather liked Lane (until I discovered he’d gassed whole villages and shot down a passenger plane to kill one person), almost as much as I liked moustachioed Walker in “Victorian gentleman about to challenge one to a duel” mode. Even though the mad-eyed Lane has terrible things planned for us, because “the greater the suffering the greater the peace”. (I do love movie villains with Big Ideas and Big Speeches to match. I know I moan about long films, but don’t cut them if doing so means chopping their narcissistic, impassioned world annihilation-justifying gibberish. Eventually even the most megalomaniacal of them mentions the compromised nature of most governments and I start thinking “Hmm, a stopped clock is right twice a day!”). The terrible things include two nuclear weapons linked together which can only be deffused (wait for it…) once the countdown has started, and which are hidden in a medical outpost at the base of a huge and rocky glacier in Kashmir, by a water source which supplies some of the most populous nations on Earth. And someone has gone off in a helicopter with the detonator which needs to be switched off, but luckily there’s another helicopter just taking off too, and a black-clad hero in pursuit.",POSITIVE

"Nov 3, 2018"," There’s a new installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise on the block, but by now these films might best be referred to by their birth name, Tom Cruise Hangs Off Of Things. You may be aware by now that there will be stunts and Tom Cruise will be risking his life for your enjoyment. Likely in the air somehow. Mission: Impossible - Fallout provides him with plentiful airborne opportunities. This time, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt deals with the immediate ramifications of Rogue Nation’s Syndicate, the global crime organization led by the now captured Solomon Lane. The dismantling has led to The Apostles, an offshoot terrorist organization that Hunt must prevent from stealing plutonium to be used for multiple nuclear weapons set for simultaneous explosion. Returning for the laughs are his cohorts played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, and a new mustachioed face: Henry Cavill as a somewhat unwilling CIA agent assigned to their unit to also keep a close eye on Hunt. Rebecca Ferguson’s British agent Ilsa Faust returns with a mission of her own that may or may not stand in opposition to Hunt’s. What unfolds is a traditional actioner where our hero battles protecting loved ones versus acting towards the greater good. This mission is partly of Hunt’s own making, having bungled obtaining the plutonium in the opening moments in order to save Rhames’ Luther. But the age old “this time it’s personal” cliche plays out in delightfully exaggerated ways, as Fallout’s villains devise umpteen scenarios that constantly put Hunt in those crosshairs. Including revisiting the specter of Hunt’s now-in-hiding former wife played by Michelle Monaghan. As these films begin to blur together, this sequel does get some mileage by shaping its hero as one who cares as much for the individual as the many, who can hold the value of both in equal measure. In that regard, Ethan Hunt has finally begun to escape being defined solely by the aura of the star that plays him. It’s not just more personal, he has more personality - and it helps make this one of the franchise’s more distinct entries, further showing that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has the series' sharpest insights into what makes Hunt a compelling character. Fallout ultimately creates its own kind of neck-bruising extended whiplash by presenting many visceral, awe-inspiring acts of daring that aren’t shot or edited all that well despite their invigorating audacity. By comparison to earlier efforts, any digital tinkering is also far more obvious and slightly dampens the impact. Comparisons to roller coasters are commonplace in summer movie season, but this is a movie that actually beats the shit out of you like the creakiest ride in the amusement park. And yet the film is burdensomely overlong, further dulling its thrill. This sequel presents the very best and the worst about this franchise in one long dose, one that is laborous to take no matter how much fun it generates. Thankfully, Ethan Hunt has gone a little soft to balance the hard blows. Tom Cruise is a cult leader who poisoned his children against their mother and is complicit in crimes and abuse cover-ups. I find him repellent and can't stand the sight of him. I know people love this franchise, but I can't abide. He's so gross and I'd just hate the experience too much (like I was with Kevin Spacey who I hadn't watched anything of for a solid decade until BABY DRIVER, which I again couldn't stand him in). The film stays pretty grounded not just because most of these things were done practically, but also the films shooting style. It has a very unique look for a modern day Hollywood blockbuster with its glowing highlights, and pronounced film grain.",POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2018"," I have a confession to make. There’s this thing that happens to people who review movies on any kind of quasi-professional circuit. A kind of numbing of the enthusiasm gland by proxy of the inability to overlook a film’s shortcomings. The more movies one takes in, the more unavoidable it is to not diagnose lazy writing, poor story structure, bland acting, choppy VFX… The collection of pratfalls these XXL “turn your brain off” tentpole films tend to suffer. When you see 200 movies a year, the bar to dazzle becomes impossibly high. What works for general audiences who catch a movie every few months often feels flat and stale for the critic – just another coat of crisp digital paint lazily slathered on poorly recycled narrative – because we’ve already seen this exact story twice this year.  I’m not trying to be elitist. Quite the opposite in fact. In many ways, us obsessive movie watchers have inoculated ourselves to thrills. We’ve chased the dragon so adamantly that nothing short of cinematic heroin manages to finger the dial. Which is to say that when a movie does manage to dazzle, to amaze, to alarm, to make one’s palms sweat and one’s knuckles cocaine white, to conjure one to stab a fingernail marks into one’s own knees – that is a feat worth standing up and dancing for. Mission Impossible: Fallout is that rare elixir for the criminally underwhelmed. Watching it, I felt like Tuco Salamanca snorting the blue. It kicks like a mule. I expect I’ll be chasing that feeling like a salivating addict for the next few years at the cineplexes. The final guard of a dying age of superstar, Tom Cruise is the last action hero and never has his skill been in sharper focus. If the Mission Impossible franchise has long been a stage for Cruise to display his considerable athleticism and unwavering charisma, Fallout is the movie equivalent of a coup de grâce; the jaw-dangling muscle work of American Ninja Warrior crossbred with the raw magnetism of a Bachelorette contestant. At one point, Cruise snaps his foot like a carrot vaulting over rooftops and limps away to make sure his team gets the shot. That kind of commitment cannot be faked. You can’t digitally create actual pain. You can’t synthesize thrills on this scale. If Fallout is one long cinematic orgasm, it sure ain’t faked. Through single-shot HALO jumps to flipping and spinning in an actual helicopter (CGI be damned), Cruise gives his body and soul over to Ethan Hunt’s death-defying shenanigans, putting himself in the pilot seat on every incredibly dangerous stunt asked of him. And that work shows. Fallout is intensity purified by extension of Cruise’s unadulterated commitment. Like Hunt for his mission, Cruise is quite literally willing to die for these movies. The post-colon Fallout part of the title applies in two ways. On the one hand, this is the first proper sequel for the now 22-year old series, with events, characters, plot-lines and even the villain (the snake-tongued Sean Harris, now with a fiery scraggle of disheveled hair) directly entangled with 2015’s Rogue Nation. Mission Impossible has long been a series built on reinvention – the constant changing of the creative guard is part and parcel of why each entry feels so wildly diverse and born anew. The injection of fresh talent has proved critical lifeblood for the series – and allows for each installment to be so stylistically dissimilar – but in maintaining the same director (Christopher McQuarrie) – a move I was admittedly initially suspect of – Mission Impossible has never reached such impossible heights.  McQuarries takes the  notion of making a direct sequel to a long running franchise – a la 007’s not-so-successful Quantum of Solace –  and uses it to blow everything up to the nth degree. The set pieces are bigger, longer, more fulfilling and always tethered to a pertinent emotional stake. If Brad Bird’s unbelievably entertaining Ghost Protocol felt like a benchmark for high-flying action-circus antics  and MI:3 tied Ethan’s emotional cycles and life outside the job into the proceedings, Mission Impossible: Fallout harangues the whole kit and caboodle into one non-stop rollercoaster of in-your-face set pieces and genuine emotional payoff.  Tipping his hat to earlier franchise watermarks, McQuarrie homages by recreating and perfecting. There’s a bite of nostalgia cheese for every Mission Impossible fan in the audience, casual or hardcore alike, with a spread of sequences that mimic that whence came before. There’s a play on the duplicitous opening interrogation of the first Mission Impossible, a Benji-navigated parkour sprint from MI:3, the high-speed motorcycle races of MI:2 and Rogue Nation. A callback to Max. Even Hunt’s skill for cliff-face free climbing makes an appearance. Fallout plays like an updated greatest hits album whose remixing transcends the original tracks. It’s a goddamn action masterpiece.  On the other side of the spectrum, Fallout is about choice. Specifically, the choice to save one life at the expense of the many. The fallout of an early decision launches the plot of this sixth mission, forcing Hunt and his team to play catch up, always a step behind, relying on hope and chance and willing to risk everything to save not just the world but each other. Ethan Hunt grapples with the idea of sacrifice at many a critical junction and McQuarrie manages to further complicate a once-not-so-well-defined character by asking what he is willing to sacrifice for the greater good. This makes for a darker entry – one super-enhanced by Rob Hardy’s artful, picturesque cinematography and Lorne Balfe’s spectacularly riveting score – one that confidently puts character development and action spectacle on the same footing.  Here, Hunt is joined by IMF mainstays Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) to recover three plutonium cores. In imprisoned anarchist Solomon Lane’s (Harris) absence, the former Syndicate has collapsed and transmogrified into rogue operators calling themselves The Apostles. With the help of recent ally/platonic love interest Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, absolutely killing it again) and under the watchful eye of sinewy handler Walker (Henry Cavill and his sex mustache, both welcome additions), Hunt and his team are tasked with recovering these weapons of mass destruction before the new world order is aggressively dismantled.  As is often the case in these kinds of movies, the plot is secondary. Even Mad Max: Fury Road, rightfully hailed as one of the few great action movies of the generation, was essentially a story about a guy and a girl driving into the desert, and then driving back. What makes an action movie soar is the world-building, the characters, the sense of adventure. And, equally important, balls-to-the-walls practical effects. CGI may have made the impossible possible but stripping that back returns gravity to the proceedings. These punches connect. These falls have weight. The fallout is real. So too is Fallout one of the greatest action movies of the 21st century.

"Nov 1, 2018"," His latest film, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” cements Cruise as the last true Movie Star in capital letters, someone whose talent and charisma transcends box office success, critical acclaim and award season notoriety. Cruise is a generational talent that has defined true stardom, that collaboration between cinema and celebrity people only talk about in past tense terms referencing Marlon Brando, Marilyn Monroe or Humphrey Bogart. There’s nothing revolutionary about the plot, which follows the same basic format as the classic television show of the same name upon which it is based. Ethan Hunt and his team of Impossible Mission Force (IMF) agents must stop a psychopathic arms dealer from obtaining a Macguffin and causing international catastrophes. This time, the Macguffin is a case of three plutonium balls intended for trade to a vigilante dead-set on detonating nuclear weapons for maximum global conflict. There’s about 10 minutes at the outset of the film that orients the audience and establishes the most clear emotional stakes in the history of the franchise. Then writer/director Christopher McQuarrie cranks the dial to 100 and sets Cruise loose for the next two hours in the most dazzling thrill ride you’re likely to see this year. In a world where over-reliance on computer-generated images have made the outrageous seem matter-of-fact, what Cruise does in his sixth turn as Hunt feels almost too possible given how easy movie magicians at a desk could make it look. And yet, “Fallout” sees Tom Cruise, Movie Star, literally jump out of airplanes 25,000 feet in the air and choreograph a mid-air rescue that works like a stunning dance of fear and tension. Cruise spends months learning to fly — and then actually piloting — helicopters in dazzling dogfight sequences. Incredibly, this doesn’t feel authentic in the moment on a first viewing. The cinematic precision and practical stunt work at play in “Fallout” reveal itself in staggering fashion on a second, third or fourth trip to theaters. Because everything audiences see is really happening, the hesitations we see on Cruise’s face are genuine. We can find ourselves churning our minds alongside him during these moments of peril. It certainly doesn’t hurt to have a talented and diverse supporting cast including a stoically serious Ving Rhames, relatable and hilarious Simon Pegg and alluring Rebecca Ferguson to pair with Cruise while Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin provide sizable resistance and gravitas. McQuarrie helps carry the weight by stepping up considerably in the director’s chair, taking lessons learned from his last outing in “Rogue Nation”and pairing it with real stakes moment to moment you’d find in the more grounded Jason Bourne franchise or the recent James Bond films. The thing that truly sets “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” apart from your average action film is its unwavering commitment to relentless, dynamic fun. Cruise and McQuarrie rev the engines from moment one and take off on the cinematic Autobahn. Though a trip down memory lane watching the prior films of the franchise (especially the first, third and fifth) will help inform viewers, you don’t have to know a lot going in to enjoy the heck out of “Fallout.”",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2018"," The great thing about the Mission Impossible series is, well, there’s a lot of great things. The film’s are always pretty whacky and retain a rather glorious silliness that keeps it from ever feeling like a James Bond clone. Tom Cruise is its lead star, a versatile, charismatic, stupidly courageous actor who is willing to go that extra mile (or in Fallout‘s case, an extra three miles in the air for a real-life Halo jump). But its whole motto was that each film would have a different director so every entry felt unique. The very first was strengthened by the precision of Brian De Palma’s directing. John Woo helmed the second, weakest film, extending the running time from around 45 to 120 minutes in slo-mo shots alone. A relative feature film rookie by the name of J.J. Abrams took charge on MI: III, an exhilarating re-charge for the audience which also featured the franchise’s, still, best villain portrayed by the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Master of Iron Giants and all things incredible, Brad Bird, was the lead on Ghost Protocol, which was praised immensely upon release. Then Christopher McQuarrie was brought in for the fifth entry, Rogue Nation, which again was given high praise for the quality of the script and inventiveness of the sequences. But for Fallout, there’s been a change of policy. McQuarrie was brought back, and working alongside Cruise very closely, they wanted to create a follow-up which still felt unique from the rest. What they have done is nothing short of extraordinary. This gloriously crafted sixquel is better pretty much in every way from its predecessors. After a mission gone wrong, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his reliable IMF allies must chase down missing plutonium before the world is destroyed. Hunt’s decisions put him in the warpath of CIA handyman Walker (Henry Cavill), and put him on a course back to an old nemesis, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The stakes are very high indeed here, but unlike the inevitability of success that ran through Rogue Nation, Fallout makes very clear early on that missions don’t always go the IMF’s way. Narratively overall, there’s not a lot of new ground being treaded on. It’s a classic ‘end of the world’ plot typical of the series, but McQuarrie, also returning as writer, infuses more deception, double crosses and twists into the several eventful moments, managing to make a familiar plot feel urgent. Cruise is on fantastically intense form, taking the light and charm you’d typically expect of Ethan Hunt but infusing it with a desperation quite unlike what we’re used to. The opening scene establishes the never-ending worry which possesses his day-to-day struggles, showing us precisely where our leading man is at and how it will affect his actions in the rest of the film. And it definitely shows – there’s a brutality in play here uncommon of the seemingly unbreathable morality of Hunt, killing people in an instant without hesitation or remorse, but with good reason at heart. It also has to be said; Cruise will go down in history as a movie legend, and this could be described as his opus. The bravery and creativity on show here is astonishing, with the Halo jump, a London pursuit and the much-talked about helicopter sequence showcasing his endless skillset.  The full ensemble give their absolute all too, with Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson returning with their full arsenal of skills, employing the heart where it’s required but working together as a magnetic force in the most suspenseful moments. Cavill makes for an intimidating, forceful brute of a villain, a figure who is mostly a match for Cruise’s Hunt. His intentions are a little predictable, removing some of the surprise later on. But the action and script is so well executed that these mild gripes can be forgiven. Sean Harris returns as the nefarious, ghoulish Lane from Rogue Nation, and build upon his creepy personality well in this entry, sensibly not forced upon the audience too much.  Particularly so in Lane’s entrance, the music will strike those goosebumps. Lorne Balfe’s score can be a little heavy on the big-chord indulgence, but there’s definite touches of Zimmer in there, tapping into the pulse-racing capabilities of the film and going that one step further, with much re-listening value.  The direction is simply sublime. McQuarrie’s impressively practical vision makes for some of the most mind-blowingly realised sequences since Mad Max: Fury Road. The afore-mentioned helicopter sequence is a feat of filmmaking to which there isn’t an appropriate word I could use that wouldn’t be classed as professional. The bar has now been set very, very high for practical set-pieces. The competency McQuarrie shows here is magnificent. This is one of the cleanest looking, most polished action movies around, with a slight grainy feel in some moments that give this a classic-in-the-making feel. The camera work is smoothly handled throughout and given a beautiful spark through the cinematography of Rob Hardy, who elevates this entry to a more technically brilliant level.  This is Cruise and McQuarrie’s masterpiece, a breathtaking spectacle and fluid thrill ride that doubles down on the espionage elements sometimes lost in the films, but retains the non-stop velocity required, and then some. The producing pair have aimed for something greater than a passable summer blockbuster here. Simply, it aims for greatness, and attains perfection, even through its imperfection. There’s too much of the old MI trope of “That’s exactly what he wants us to do!” or something along those lines. But the fact there’s still touches of that gleeful silliness present in an otherwise seriously produced blockbuster means the heart and soul of the franchise is very much beating.",POSITIVE

"Oct 30, 2018","The laws of movie gravity aren't supposed to work like this, but here we are. Twenty-two years in, six movies deep, and we have not only a franchise best, but a high-water mark for the entire genre.",POSITIVE
"Oct 29, 2018"," We regret to inform you that James Bond has been official canceled until further notice. The iconic spy that dominated the action genre for 50 years as the height of espionage-inspired spectacle has been lapped by Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, the super-spy of the Mission: Impossible films. It’s been trending this way for a little while. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol brought the series to dazzling new heights only to ramp up further with Rogue Nation. All the while Bond flicks were stuck in a cycle of hit or miss movies. Now with Mission: Impossible – Fallout, it’s undeniable. The spy genre is now owned outright by Tom Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, as Fallout delivers everything one could want from a globetrotting action-packed adventure. The stunts, the scenery, the escalating suspense swell into a stunning spectacle unmatched in modern cinema. Mission: Impossible has been angling to take the mantle of best action franchise and with the all-out insanity of Fallout, it takes that mantle, obliterating all of its competition along the way. Fallout is a rarity in the M:I series as it’s a direct sequel to the events of Rogue Nation. The nefarious Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has been captured but his army of rogue agents across the world carry on his work under the name of The Apostles. The Apostles want to secure plutonium to craft three atomic bombs that they plan to detonate in hopes of destroying the modern world order. Presented with the mission that he chose to accept, Ethan Hunt and his reliable team including Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) venture around the world in search of the highly in demand plutonium. However, one slip up has the CIA not trusting the IMF team, and CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) installs her agent August Walker (Henry Cavil) alongside Hunt on his covert mission in Paris. By the sixth film in the series, Ethan Hunt knows his way around the world of international espionage, meaning that he only truly trusts those who have been longtime members of his team. When the mission has him posing an international to infiltrate a deal brokered by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), Hunt can’t take anyone at their word which makes for some great moments of tension followed by unpredictable action. Thing get even more complicated when Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) joins the picture and her mission is seemingly at odds with Hunt’s. The larger picture of the plot is incredibly simple – bad guys want nukes; good guys want to stop them. It’s the smaller character details and interactions where the film gets more complex but it’s easy to retain a sense of where everyone stands since Ethan Hunt is the film and the series’ moral compass. And did I tell that this movie had action? I mean, Mission: Impossible – Fallout has so many jaw-dropping sequences of holy shit action. Cruise does the incredible HALO jump from upward of 20,000 feet. Then there’s a stunning motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris. McQuarrie presents a keen eye for capturing action and coherently tying the racing images together so that nothing is lost in the high-speed fray. A fight with Cruise and Cavil vs. Liang Yang in a bathroom is absolutely wild, masterfully highlighting the physicality of the actors engaged in battle and McQuarrie’s deft staging of the melee. Cruise employs his trademark sprint through the streets of London at high speed, jumping from rooftops and through windows in another thrilling sequence. All of which culminates in the spectacular finale, a thrilling helicopter chase through the Indian mountains with the fate of the world on the line. The scale is immense, the action insane, and all of it presented with astonishing precision. Cruise continues to go above and beyond the call of duty as an action hero, and his work in Fallout stands as some of his most daring works yet. Jackie Chan is sitting back and watching Tom Cruise’s stunt work and questioning his sanity. Say what you will about Cruise’s personal life choices, the man is immensely dedicated to his craft and takes his work to incredible levels, placing himself at risk to entertain you. That’s a fuckin’ movie star. One thing that makes Fallout so compelling for fans of the Mission: Impossible series is the villainous Solomon Lane, who is basically a funhouse mirror version of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. Sean Harris speaks in this chilling raspy whisper that oozes emotional detachment and moral nihilism. Lane wants to ruin the current world order and is willing to kill millions to achieve that goal. Hunt, on the other hand, is decidedly apolitical – he doesn’t oppose Lane’s plans because of any guiding ideological draw but simply that his plan would cause the death of untold millions. I really think that McQuarrie knows that making the film too overtly political would be dangerous territory and retaining a certain apolitical idealism around Hunt makes it better for the audience to embrace as a hero regardless of their standing on the political spectrum – this, mind you, is more a commentary on the current state of American politics than the work of Tom Cruise, Christopher McQuarrie, or the entire Mission: Impossible series which has really avoided making any strong political stances in the past. Nearly 24 hours after seeing Mission: Impossible – Fallout, I’m still buzzing with a cinematic high thanks to the action-packed work McQuarrie and Cruise. If possible, I would’ve turned right around to watch it again. Many try to make movies on this scale that are so damned captivating but, my god, these Mission: Impossible movies continue to pull off the impossible. A dazzling high-wire act of a movie, Mission Impossible – Fallout is another winner for the series, with Tom Cruise performing some of his most amazing stunts in Christopher McQuarrie’s insanely entertaining sequel. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls.",POSITIVE
"Oct 26, 2018"," The Cruisemeister is back in full action and full sparkly teeth mode in Mission Impossible: Fallout, the latest instalment in the Ethan Hunt saga. Joining him once more is director Christopher McQuarrie – following on from Rogue Nation and past Tom efforts in Jack Reacher and The Edge of Tomorrow amongst other things. After five movies in a decent franchise, what could they do next? To stop a worldwide disaster, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and the IMF team – Luther (Rhames) and Benji (Pegg) – must team up with CIA assassin (Cavill) after an initial effort to reclaim stolen plutonium from terror group The Apostles is botched. With the weapons now missing and in real danger of falling into the wrong hands, Hunt and the gang must track the plutonium down in a race against time before it’s too late. McQuarrie, Cruise, and co. had a mission and, boy, did they choose to accept it. By the time any franchise reaches its sixth installment, there’s always the real fear that things could get a bit stale and/or monotonous. It’s as if McQuarrie realised this, used his loaf and decided to go the other way. By fully incorporating the previous movies into Ethan Hunt’s character and story, things really felt natural and the bigger story was helped by this fact. The story itself is very good, as is the writing, acting and, of course, the action – some of the set pieces and stunts are mind-blowingly good. Do yourselves a favour, see it on the biggest screen possible and be blown away by one of the best action movies in decades. Tom Cruise once more shows that he is a real action star – it’s well known that he performs his own stunts but it’s worth mentioning once more because some of the stunts in Fallout are exceptional. The man shows no signs of slowing down and he’s as good as ever here. Henry Cavill and moustache are big, beefy, handsome and imposing with Pegg, Rhames, Ferguson, and Baldwin all excellent as well. Having Maverick, Nicholas Angel, Superman, The Boss Baby and Diamond Dog on screen together was always going to be ace. Set piece-wise, this movie is sensational. The much-talked-about HALO jump over Paris is breathtaking – combined with stunning imagery – and an exhilarating motorbike chase later in the movie is a fine example of how a city chase should be done. The action is brutal (particularly a toilet battle early in the movie) and I wouldn’t fancy bumping into a pissed off Cavill either. DoP Rob Hardy does a fine job here as well with some beautiful imagery and scenes that further fuel the movie – not to mention Lorne Balfe’s majestic score. What I particularly took joy in was the fact that the movie never felt long or bloated with its 147-minute runtime, the pacing was just right and there’s something in every scene to keep you glued to what’s going on. Were some of the events contrived or maybe even overblown? Sure, but in a movie this good, it’s forgivable. Delivering the best movie in a franchise that’s already five efforts in a marvellous feat from McQuarrie, Cruise et al and Fallout is more than deserving of the acclaim. It’s big, exhilarating, breathtaking and simply just bloody good – accept the mission.",POSITIVE
"Oct 18, 2018"," Directed by Christopher McQuarrieStarring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon PeggRunning time 2 hours 27 minutesMPAA rating: PG-13by Sandy DeVito, Rosalie Kicks, Dan ScullyThe Tommy C. Appreciation Club, or TCAC, solemnly swears to watch and appreciate all theatrical performances by Tom Cruise then recap them, round-table style. In this edition, the Moviejawn crew embarks on a bonkers adventure with our pal Tommy in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Sandy DeVito, The WitchQueen of Darkness: Okay, y'all. TOMMY CLUB REVIVAL NUMBER ONE. I still don't really understand how I missed Tommy C. Club the last time around, but I'm very pleased it’s been revived. I've been watching a lot of Tommy in the past two weeks because I marathon'd all the M:I movies in prep for Fallout (I'd only ever seen the de Palma one before this marathon) and let me tell you, they did NOT disappoint. Rogue Nation is definitely the best one, harnessing all the camp, drama and suspense scattered throughout the previous four. But I digress.Fallout is fucking great for one thing in particular: THE STUNTS ARE FUCKING BANANAS. Tommy jumps out of airplanes at hundreds of thousands of feet. Tommy uses a rope to scale a helicopter mid-flight only to careen it through the air trying to avoid a machine gun and crash it into another helicopter and then both helicopters CRASH DOWN A FUCKING MOUNTAIN and teeter on the precipice of a ravine. Tommy has a fucking incredibly choreographed fight in a bathroom that you frankly must see to believe. Tommy drag races cars down tiny London streets. There isn't one nuclear bomb in this narrative, THERE ARE TWO, and they can't be conventionally disarmed, and I bit my pinky nail off in suspense at that end sequence. And the best thing about all this bonkers action is Tommy did a bunch of his own stunts. Tommy is an animal. But I will say, I find it pretty ironic that McQuarrie switched out one problematic asshole with another. It's also not a great look to state disparaging shit about #MeToo when your next on-screen role is playing a (sort of a spoiler?) horrible villain? Movies like this are escapism, but that's a blending of reality and fantasy I could fucking do without. Dan Scully: Surprising nobody who has ever heard me speak of this series (or really any movie), I absolutely adored Fallout. It may take a second viewing to be sure, but this might be my new favorite M:I entry, a distinction which has always gone to Ghost Protocol. If I may introduce objectivity into a purely subjective matter, I believe this to be the best film in the franchise so far (“best” and “favorite” are distinctions I’m happy to make - fight me).While I know we’re here to shower love upon the smiling face of Tommy C., the person who emerges as the true winner of this production is writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. We often don’t think of him as an auteur so much as a screenwriter who made the jump to filmmaking, but Fallout has all but assured that he will go down as one of the great blockbuster storytellers. He’s certainly made one of the smartest and most exciting blockbusters of the modern era — heck, of all time. In an era where crisp action has been replaced with crispy action — where sequences are assembled in post-production as opposed to being built from the ground up — it’s exciting to see action serve as a narrative device, rather than just punctuation for the sake of adhering to genre form. It’s doubly exciting to see action that has clarity, a notion that has become foreign to so many action flicks. Here, the visuals have a soft edge and a fluidity not often seen at the multiplex, while still packing an unbelievable wallop. Add to that an exciting, game cast with Tommy “I will do literally anything so long as it’s crazy” Cruise at the forefront, and you simply can’t lose. In my humble opinion, Fallout is a masterpiece. Rosalie Kicks, Old Sport: I would not go as far to say it's a masterpiece, however Fallout is a damn fine action movie. Despite the run time being two hours and twenty-seven minutes, I found it to move swiftly. There were moments that I even found my heart racing. This wasn’t just due to Tommy C.'s captivating smile either. Don't fret, Tommy C. charms, but it is the incredibly bonkers action sequences that will leave you talking. Particularly, the motorcycle chase Tommy C has with Rebecca Ferguson. Rebecca, lady, you are freaking rad. Having stopped watching the franchise with the J.J. Abrams, Mission: Impossible III, I am pleased to find that my timing to return is impeccable, as I totally missed the Renner years. It was a pleasant surprise to see Ving Rhames still hanging in there and the Simon Pegg addition. Simon is always a pleasure to spend time with and should be in every major universe franchise thing. The nerdy Benji character he portrays won my heart. I'm still astonished by all the practical effects that were used to make this movie particularly THE MASKS! Thanks to Angela Bassett, I am now able to refer to this as a Halloween movie. Masks are great (unless we are talking the mask of Crispin), and I love that they are such an integral part of this series. A movie like this is the reason that you go to the theater. You need to see it big or not at all. In my eyes, Tommy C. has now completely redeemed himself after that unspeakable ""movie"" in which he attempted to dabble as a Universal Monster. In Fallout, Tommy C. doesn't let you down. His charisma oozes off the screen and it is easy to see that he cares about us and our viewing experience. Tommy C. gives it everything he has. I have never in my life seen him run faster, jump higher or deliver lines smoother. I'm back aboard the Cruise ship and am convinced that no matter what the mission is, with Tommy C. it is always possible. Cuz’ as he so confidently reminds us throughout the flick, ""I'll figure it out."" Sandy DeVito, The WitchQueen of Darkness: You know what I really love about Tommy C.? I love the fact that he clearly loves the audiences who come to see his movies. Some actors and filmmakers, you get the impression they're sick of people, or that they even enjoy mocking the audience or their fans or the press. But Tommy? Tommy loves the people. Tommy's movies are always for ordinary people. He makes movies because he loves to make movies. He loves his audience, and he wants to do whatever he can to make them happy. Tommy's zodiac sign is Cancer, and Cancer people love to make the people they love HAPPY. Every time I watch a Tommy movie (Fallout is no exception), I get a strong feeling he wants to make me happy with his performance. It's clear that Tommy isn't just an actor who loves his job, he's also a fan of movies. And that's everything when you're watching a film; you can feel that radiating out from the screen. He's doing all those crazy stunts for YOU. He's smiling for YOU. He's being intense and professing to be the storm for YOU, dear audience. Tommy is a true movie star. Oh, you know what I don't want though? I don't want Ethan (Tommy) and Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) to be lovers. I don't even want them to be fuck buddies. I just want them to be close friends who really respect each other and would help each other out of any kind of jam, platonically. I just really don't want them to fuck, y'all. Why can't Ilsa just live? Does Ethan really need to be fucking someone on the regular? We've already figured out (via Michella Monaghan's Jules) that any kind of long-term relationship for him is gonna be super difficult due to his (fucking crazy) line of work. Can't he just have wildly romantic flings? Can't Ilsa? I'm glad they avoided making them kiss or some cliche shit like that, and don't get me wrong, I fucking love romance and sex and kissing in movies, but I just don't want that for them. And if he was gonna be with anyone long-term, it should have been Thandie Newton (M:I 2 is fucking great, y'all, fuck off). Also, I said this to Rosalie, but after this, I definitely need a break from the M:I franchise. I marathoned all of them and as enjoyable as they are (very), I need a break from the Batshit Stunt genre for a bit. I have a watchlist that's 900+ films long! I need variety in my life. Also, I would really, really love to see a woman direct the next M:I film. I think that would be fucking awesome. I think that would be totally rad. If anyone can find a way to up the ante after the absolutely insane stunts in Fallout, it's a woman. Dan Scully: In re-watching the entire series, the one thing I wanted to track was how much of a character Ethan Hunt really is. With accusations abound that Tommy C. is only playing himself, I thought it important to try and parse out just how much of Hunt is script and how much is Cruise. I’m pleased to report that Hunt is most definitely a character, but that this character, as evidenced by another repeated phrase in Fallout shares the same core values as the actor: “I won’t let you down.” No sir, you sure as shit have not let us down.  And that really is the magic of a Tommy C. as Sandy said, his goal is to entertain us at all costs, and short of a few poor role choices here and there, he never disappoints. Even in something dumb like The Mummy, he can never be accused of phoning it in, a distinction that few actors can say of their body of work. Tommy C. shows the hell up no matter what, and when paired with a director like McQuarrie, another artist who simply refuses to give less than his all, the results are magic. I must wholeheartedly agree that I wish for no type of sexual relationship to bud between Hunt and Ilsa. It just doesn’t work and is totally unneeded. I think Fallout put an ice cap on Hunt’s dalliance with suburban normalcy, and that’s where it should stay. Ilsa is like 20 years his junior and is way too strong of a character to be pinned down with something so passé and unnecessary. And if there’s one thing Tommy can’t really do, IMO, it’s heteronormative sexiness. I just don’t buy it. Cruise and Hunt read as distinctly asexual to me and that’s kinda how I like it. Something tells me that this will be the last M:I movie, and I think it serves well as a series capper, and really, how can we possibly escalate things further? Send Tommy C. to space? Sure, he’ll do it, but I think I’m good. But if we are to make another one, and we were to hire a woman to direct, I’ll throw my hat in the ring for Michelle MacLaren. And if we really want to continue the series without Tommy C. (which we don’t) I see no reason why Rebecca Ferguson couldn’t carry the series, snapping necks with her thighs through at least two more entries. If the mission was to create a stunning entry in a 22-year old franchise, with an eye toward upping every aspect of it to oblivion, well, mission accomplished. Rosalie Kicks, Old Sport: A Rebecca Ferguson Mission spin off, bring it! That lady is YES and needs to be in more flicks. However, I'd like to believe that this franchise will keep going as long as Tommy is breathing in and out. Seriously, Tommy C. ain't ever biting the dust.  (Ed. note: Thousands of Scientologists will tell you he won't). He has gotta have some kind of plan figured out. He's a prepper. Nothing can stop this guy. Not even a jazzy scooter. Tommy is going to keep running, jumping and donning rubber masks until it is coffin time. Picture it, scooter stunts. Scooter stunts in space! The possibilities are endless and truly nothing is impossible. The Tommy C. Report Card was completed by Sandy DeVito, Rosalie Kicks, Dan Scully and our friends at Cinedelphia, Jill Malcolm & Ryan Silberstein. The final score reflects an average of all report cards completed by TCAC and is taken extremely seriously...which is to be expected.",POSITIVE

"Oct 16, 2018"," Over 20 years ago (!), Tom Cruise brought us the first chapter of a franchise nobody ever expected to last. After a bit of a misstep with the sequel (sorry, I know it has its supporters, but it’s an overbloated mess) and disappointing box office result from the third film, many assumed it may be the last we’d seen of Ethan Hunt. Thankfully, Paramount stuck with this franchise, and thank god they did. With Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sixth film of this saga, they’ve delivered one of the greatest action films of all time and one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the year. Yep. It’s that good. It’s a genuine rarity to see a franchise improve with each chapter, let alone arrive at its high point with its sixth offering. But the Mission: Impossible franchise just gets better and more ridiculously entertaining with age. Just like Cruise, the series has become one of the most reliable properties in Hollywood. Each film has delivered more insane thrills and delicious action than its predecessor, yet never feels overdone or contrite. In bang for your buck terms, this may be the most solid return on your admission price all year. Can you tell I had an outrageously fun time with this film? Normally with action films, the plot is rather superfluous to the action. But one of this franchise’s brilliant calling cards has been its determination to spin a narrative so overloaded with complications and exposition, it makes your head spin. Carrying on from Rogue Nation (it’s not essential to have seen the fifth instalment but it sure helps), Fallout begins with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his trusty sidekick Benji Dunn (a fabulous Simon Pegg) attempting to gain possession of three missing plutonium orbs. The dangerous spheres are in the hands of rogue MI6 agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the former leader of the villainous group known as The Syndicate. After the events of the previous film left The Syndicate in ruins, Solomon now leads the remaining members the organisation, calling them his “Apostles,” who are hell-bent on causing mass-destruction around the globe so a new world order can rise up. During the botched operation, Ethan is forced to choose between saving his perennial wingman Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) or taking ownership of the nuclear material. As has always been his one fatal character flaw, Ethan chooses the life of the ones he loves over the lives of potentially millions. While this decision sits well with IMF boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), it incurs the wrath of new CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett). Seeing Ethan’s actions as wildly uncontrollable, Erica sends her “fixer” August Walker (a scene-stealing Henry Cavill) to accompany Ethan on the mission to locate Solomon alive and recover the stolen orbs. More importantly, August is strictly instructed to keep a close eye on Ethan’s every move, clouding his true intentions and allegiances. Complicating matters is the return of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebeca Ferguson), who has been ordered to eliminate Solomon in order to restore her reputation with the British spy organisation, thus burying the secret of The Syndicate’s existence. Adding to the complicated mix is a mysterious deal-broker named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a wealthy femme fatale with a knack for black market arms dealing and a particular interest in Ethan, who is posing to her as an Apostle named John Lark. As the mission to locate Solomon takes Ethan and his crew around the globe, it becomes increasingly likely not everything is as it seems and someone is potentially playing both sides. But just who is playing who? And who can Ethan really trust when the fate of the world is at stake? If this plot sounds horrendously complex, you’re not wrong. It’s a dizzying maze filled with double-crosses, hidden agendas, and, of course, a swag of those infamous and franchise-staple uber-realistic masks. Sure, its stakes aren’t exactly the most original. The “uh oh, a terrorist group has a bunch of nukes” action movie trope has been done dozens and dozens of times before. But it’s a minor quibble in a film that gets everything else so perfectly right. The zig-zagging narrative continually keeps you guessing, leaving the audience superbly entertained. The misdirections are all perfectly and intelligently executed and they’re only elevated by the film’s utterly jaw-dropping action sequences. With a pace that barely ever stops to take a breath (or allow you to collect yours), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is genuinely one of the best action films there has ever been. Director Christopher McQuarrie’s decision to essentially make the film one giant whirlwind trip around the globe is utterly magic, managing to drop the action into the most dazzling of backdrops. We get a madcap dash across some London rooftops (featuring Cruise’s infamous ankle-breaking leap which is left untouched in the film and genuinely painful to watch), a heart-pounding Ronin-esque car chase through the streets of Paris, a spectacularly brutal hand-to-hand fight inside the pristine white bathroom of a Paris nightclub, a skydiving sequence where Ethan and August literally leap right into the middle of a lightning storm, and the Kasmir-based (well, it’s actually New Zealand) finale featuring a chaotic helicopter showdown and plenty of heart-racing cliff-climbing. McQuarrie proved himself a master of capturing these sensational sequences in the previous film, but he really ups the game here, delivering set pieces unlike any we’ve seen in 2018. This makes anything Marvel has dished up look tame by comparison, particularly with McQuarrie and Cruise’s insistence on using practical stunt work generally performed by the actor himself. Cruise is clearly having an absolute ball filming every single ridiculous scenario, creating moments which feel completely authentic and utterly terrifying. We know Ethan is going to make it through each calamity, but McQuarrie crafts each piece with such nail-biting tension, it’s somehow hard not to expect the worst. With every near-death experience, there were plenty of gasps in my cinema, including a few elicited from yours truly. Every moment in Mission: Impossible – Fallout is entirely earned. By mostly ignoring the use of green screens and digital wizardry, the astonishing physical effects feel entirely human with genuine risk and danger presented for the audience’s entertainment. It’s what made Mad Max: Fury Road such a sublime visceral experience and it’s the same masterstroke of genius on display here. You’ll hear this a lot, but you really do need to seek out the biggest screen possible on which to view this film. It’s an enveloping rollercoaster that you will not want to end, despite it’s rather mammoth running time. McQuarrie keeps the film moving at such a breakneck speed, you will barely notice you’ve been sitting in your chair for over two hours. Backed by an impeccable supporting cast, Cruise shines like always, managing to completely eliminate any trace of that period of time when he became somewhat of a Hollywood pariah. His enthusiasm and energy for this role have not diminished one iota and he’s so completely relaxed in Ethan’s skin. In a career of iconic performances, it’s highly likely this will be the one we remember most fondly. We’ve seen him hurl himself around like this six times now, yet it’s still thrilling to watch him take his intensity to an entirely new level. His camaraderie with Pegg and Rhames is once-again beautifully genuine. His rivalry with Cavill is absolutely delicious. And his chemistry with Ferguson is downright electric. It’s a terrific ensemble treat where every cast member is matching Cruise’s unrelenting commitment. If this is to be his swansong as Ethan Hunt, he’s going out on a high. At a time when sequel and tentpole exhaustion is at an all-time high, it’s decidedly refreshing to find a sequel hitting such an impressive home run. McQuarrie has crafted a follow-up that takes everything that’s great about this franchise and strives to push further. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is everything a giant summer blockbuster should be, and then some. It’s a non-stop thrill ride that entertains like nothing else has this year, thus far. It’s the perfect blend of action and narrative that makes for such joyful cinema. Accept this mission and have an absolute ball.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018"," This far along the M:I track, we should, at least subconsciously, feel like Rogue Nation‘s Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, field status remains questionable): well-aware that the declared impossibility is a ruse. Sure, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, enjoyment apparent and series’ hair rule broken again) can react with the “Dude…” expression and struggle come action time, but we know how things will play out. Fool once, shame you, twice me, et cetera. It’s the sixth turn now. So why do we stay seated? Maybe it’s because, after 2, each installment accomplishes in being finer than the one before, like white-knuckled cheese and high-octane wine. J.J. Abrams’ gusto makes the agent’s domestic life one worth saving. Brad Bird’s realization of Pixar-tinged ingenuity brings glee into the usual doomsday plot. Christopher McQuarrie matures the whole supply with dives into intrigues and consequences. In other words, it’s the directors rather than the characters, the engineers instead of the passengers, who face the can-be-unwinnable trial of raising the bar. Fortunately, victory has never been out of stock, and Fallout turns what it nabs into a feet-off-ground, fireworks-all-around kind of actioner. ­Your mission, the only one, is to be onboard and avoid the bunker at all costs. It helps that McQuarrie is again the helmer and the scribe (franchise’s first!), rendering Fallout both a challenge and a possible upgrade. Or a greater challenge as it can become an upgrade. For those believing that Rogue Nation was sluggish, slightly or wholly, Fallout hears you, and in response it moves with the fast-forward button held down. See the effect right from the start: Only single-digit minutes (four?) have passed and then Ethan is given the briefer, which prior to self-destruction outlines two items — the rising of The Apostles, aka what’s left of in-custody MI6 turncoat Solomon Lane (Sean Harris)’s Syndicate, and their need to snatch three plutonium Poké Balls for an imminent “great suffering.” The usual suspects of close-calls, country-hopping, mask-making, infiltrations and stunts abound. Downright great callbacks to every previous Mission and satisfying payoffs for every department are also in the cargo hold. The latter is why Fallout is the same bullet-train on a different track, one where the only stopping point is at the end of the line. It’s a setting where a radioactive midnight is one minute away — why thanks, Ethan, for losing the bombs! — so such velocity is justified. We might feel like the Road Runner trying to keep up with the proceedings — an arms-dealing scioness (Vanessa Kirby, seductive through diction) knows where the WMDs are, Lane is returning, loyalty again forcing Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, fashionably chilly) to complicate the mission, a frustrated CIA assigning its own deadly angel (Henry Cavill, engaging) for support, and nightmares with Julia (Michelle Monaghan, kindness galore) — but McQuarrie always has us oriented and, amazingly, whiplash-free. With riveting concision in the penning, he guarantees that the prerequisite, adeptly built espionage-y webs won’t entangle us; once the details are communicated it’s all about perfecting the ensuing sensation. An M:I film with an emotional thread that bears as much impact as the explosions? It’s here, and that’s a mighty-fine bonus on top of the franchise’s bread-and-butter aspects that Fallout have either elevated or sharpened. Though everyone’s in a hurry, production designer Peter Wenham doesn’t use that as an excuse to take shortcuts; the conversion of Paris’ Grand Palais into a classy rave at the front and a jazz club in the back is a definite highlight. A new world is yet nigh, though composer Lorne Balfe’s hymnic-then-catastrophic orchestrations, editor Eddie Hamilton’s patient cutting and d.p. Rob Hardy’s steadfast framing suggest it has been the state of things after the production logos. “The impossibility is real,” the trio’s work, combined with McQuarrie’s direction, declared, and you’ll believe it, willingly, too, as Ethan HALO-jumped into Paris, burns rubber on a bike and later a car in something straight out of “Ronin 2.0,” and bends physics while piloting a heli to a cliffside boxing ring at the home stretch. Oof, the adrenaline just rises upon typing this. Still, we shouldn’t ignore that it is in the leading man that M:I finds its existence. There will come a point where Cruise has to refuse the mission, and most of us believed it arrived last August. Intentional or not, narrative purposes or otherwise, for Ethan or his vessel Cruise, the sense of an ending is suffocating in Fallout, allowing sweat beads to mingle with the electricity from big-screen thrills. “I won’t let you down,” IMF’s poster agent uttered at one point, and afterward it’d be wise to believe that you will hear the statement echoing for as long as the team stays in commission.",POSITIVE
"Oct 11, 2018",Without question the best blockbuster of the year. Mission accomplished!,POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2018"," The film franchise that doubles as Tom Cruise’s personal playground and workout center is BACK in Mission: Impossible – Fallout! A direct sequel to the last adventure, Rogue Nation, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt unwittingly facilitates the theft of three balls of plutonium, snatched up by a covert group (aren’t they always?) known only as “The Apostles”. Their mission: to distribute these as dirty bombs and trigger a catastrophic, global event which could reset life as we know it. Ethan’s mission, which he never fails to accept, is to retrieve the plutonium, identify the source known only as John Lark, and prevent untold destruction. The sixth film in a franchise over 20 years old, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is not breaking any new ground in terms of plot or action spectacle. You take your seat, and you know exactly what to expect: dire circumstances, insanely unbelievable rubber masks, flashy stunts, double agents, a handful of gadgets, and a 93% chance Tom Cruise runs like a gazelle at some point before the final credits scroll. Much like writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s script, this isn’t rocket science. Speaking of the story, it IS ludicrous and preposterous, and I honestly couldn’t care less. There are films where plot points and continuity errors can crash a movie like this to its knees, but Mission: Impossible is exempt for me in this regard. In fact, I would have a hard time reciting ANY of the M:I plots outside of the first – and still greatest – film in the series. As with James Bond, Ethan Hunt is a character I want to see either escape or pursue, that is his nature. So if the plot doesn’t matter, what does? Spectacle. Good, old-fashioned eye candy. No, I’m not talking about Henry Cavill and his humongous biceps as CIA assassin August Walker. It’s the visceral thrills contained within this 2-plus hours that will keep audiences on the edge of their seat for the duration. In this film alone, we have a heart-thumping HALO jump, a motorcycle chase through city traffic, the obligatory “RUN, TOM, RUNNNNN!” scene (where Cruise sprints further than that runway in Fast and Furious 6), and the electric finale with helicopters dueling mid-air while traversing a mountain range. Any one of these in another franchise would function as a centerpiece to build a story around. In Fallout, there simply isn’t enough time between set-pieces for a layered narrative, and that’s a perfectly acceptable reasoning. Casting wise, the IMF returns in full (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Alec Baldwin, and a pleasant throwback to a character from previous films), with the primary addition lying with the impressively massive shoulders that belong to Henry Cavill. August Walker is referred to as the “hammer” to Hunt’s “scalpel”, and this analogy simply boggles the mind. I’m exceptionally boggled. While Walker prefers the direct approach of using his lethality to confront issues, it’s not like Hunt is blowing kisses and hugging babies. They both take their problems to pound town, leaving gaggles of random terrorist red-shirts suffering severe musculature damage in their wake. Regardless, even though Cavill emotes as effectively as a random block of wood, his sheer stature posits him as a formidable conflict for Hunt to contend with. That brings me to Ethan Hunt. After 20 years, Tom Cruise has used the magic of his genetic lottery winnings to great advantage as he once again insists on performing most of his own stunts. A lot of media attention is paid to this whiter version of Jackie Chan and his preference to test the limits of insurance payouts by performing in this manner at his age. The truth is, it works. I don’t know about you, but even with the technology we currently have, I can ALWAYS tell when an actor has had a CGI touchup or a stunt man has taken up his slack. You can call Tom Cruise whatever you want, as long as you preface it with “this guy would sever his own pinkie toe to make a movie more stimulating for audiences”. Because he proves it’s true, every single time. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an exciting spy flick that thrives on that summer movie spirit. If you can look past a story you’ve seen countless times and the weird way McQuarrie chooses to shoot Cavill and Cruise at cockeyed angles so “one” of them doesn’t appear to be a hobbit compared to the other; then strap in for one of the most thrilling films of the summer! I’m still not sure what the hell, if anything, really happened. But I do know Tom Cruise looked damn good saving us all.",POSITIVE
"Oct 10, 2018"," Tom Cruise has done it again. I don’t know how this dude always does this, but he seems like he is a non-stop machine for great action movies. The Mission: Impossible franchise has been a great series that survived through some crazy ups and downs. However, its center, Cruise, has always put out enough effort to make these movies feel special in ways other franchises can’t uphold. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is unique in the franchise for being one of the only direct sequels. Lots of characters and ideas from the 5th film, Rogue Nation come back to complete their arcs. Yet at the same time, you can enter the movie and still quickly get the stakes. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) cares about people and his team. They’ll always come before others, and he’ll go out of his way to ensure their safety. It’s a core value to the character that gets pushed to the limits here. The real star of this movie, beyond Cruise, has got to be Christopher McQuarrie. The Oscar-winning screenwriter for The Usual Suspects has now become a Cruise specialty director. In addition to both MI5 and MI6, McQuarrie directed the first Jack Reacher film and wrote Edge of Tomorrow. This guy just gets Cruise and allows him to jump headfirst into these death traps. Yet the way he shoots the action is simply unparalleled. The first hour of the movie is near perfection. You could strip away all the dialogue and easily tell the film through the visual imagery. It’s the closest a movie has come to perfect visual storytelling in the action genre since Mad Max: Fury Road. This is also a film that never really makes you feel it’s runtime, despite a two and half hour runtime. The pacing is extraordinary, and McQuarrie uses set piece after set piece to deliver amazing scenes. You can easily refer to several of those set pieces as instantly iconic. The bathroom. The club inside the museum. The race through Paris. The helicopter chase. Each of these scenes is awesome in its own right, but when tiled together they create a next level action film. The scenes in Paris stick out as some of the best scenes in the franchise. The cat and mouse game between Cruise and Vanessa Kirby is one for the ages. In these movies, it is rare for someone to actually go into a scene with Cruise and take it over. Kirby does it over and over again in limited screen time, which will make you wish she was in the movie a lot more. Henry Cavill does some okay work, but nothing outside of his normal range. He’s big and bulky, a physically formidable member of Hunt’s team. The arm reload has got to be one of the funniest, yet most badass things in an action movie in years. Angela Bassett makes the most of her screen time and continues to showcase why she should just get cast in everything. Sean Harris proves yet again that the Harris bloodline is simply born to act. The son of Jared Harris (Mad Men/ The Crown) and Richard Harris (Harry Potter) is someone who can invoke pure evil when he chooses to. It’s a skill that is very underrated and should serve him well in a long career. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are back again, helping to make a fun team to surround Cruise. You can easily argue that Rhames is overacting a bit here, but he’s serviceable through most of the film. Pegg is very fun again, making you wish they used him more. Rebecca Ferguson steals many scenes in the film and again can physically match up with anyone. It’s very similar to Evangeline Lilly’s ability to take over Ant-Man and the Wasp, but she’s not quite as dynamic. Overall, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is one of the best entries in the franchise. It is both emotionally and visually exciting to experience. While it won’t crack my Top 10 of the year, it’s clear why it will for some. It’s undeniably one of the best of the summer and should be seen on the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE
"Sep 28, 2018","  MI6 fulfills everything the Mission: Impossible franchise has to offer if not much more. Tom Cruise’s frequent directorial collaborator and “Fallout” co-screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie (“Jack Reacher,” “Edge of Tomorrow,” and “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation”) orchestrates the film’s overblown action with meticulous attention to detail, perhaps a little too much.  The car chase sequences, while impressive, don’t come near the unpredictable nature of the one William Friedkin filmed for “To Live and Die in L.A.” Still, there is plenty of splashy gravity defying spectacle to wash over you as you watch a movie that was clearly made with an IMAX screen in mind. The stunts are gut wrenching, and the helicopter stunts are out of this world. You need every inch of that 80’ by 100’ IMAX screen to experience what the filmmakers have in mind, which is to blow yours. Another trip through the editing process would have helped tighten the pace but no one is coming out of this film not feeling like they didn’t get their money’s worth. The politics of the MacGuffin-laden plot are sufficiently bland so that no audience member feels left out or put upon regardless of their political leanings. Even anarchists should feel right at home with this film’s cartoonish narrative design since the villain here is a Ted Kaczynski knock off. Bad guy number one has a crew of “Apostles” helping him destroy world order. Don’t worry, there’s only one bloody scene in the whole movie, and the rest of the violence is strictly of the cartoon variety. Our height-challenged action man Ethan Hunt (Cruise) still receives his mission assignments in the same old-school method of a self-destructing reel-to-reel tape. Considering the franchise landscape at hand, what surprises most are the casting choices that fail. Alec Baldwin’s IMF character Alan Hunley (Ethan’s boss) seems like he walked onto the wrong set on the day he needed to shoot the handful of scenes he’s in. However, Baldwin does deliver one primo piece of acting while performing one of dramaturgy’s most traditional tropes. No plot spoiler here; you’ll know it when you see it. Angela Bassett also falls flat, regardless of her ageless beauty, as CIA director Erica Sloan. Bassett’s tempo and tone don’t match with the movie as a whole. What does work in the character department is the reliable chemistry between Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, and Tom Cruise. Here is an onscreen friendship that feels like an old pair of slip-on house shoes. Michelle Monaghan is as perfect as it gets for onscreen romance. No shortage of mask disguises provides a series of nods to the original “Mission: Impossible” television show, while providing the movie with some nifty plot twists that register with an added amount of humor.

"Sep 27, 2018"," The sixth movie in producer-star Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series is a marvel of American engineering. This exciting, semi-adult cartoon of espionage could have been laid out in an intricate schematic instead of a screenplay. Its savvy amalgamation of gimmickry, glamour, and athletics, on the one hand, and spy games played like mind games, on the other, generates tension and release for a super-swift 147 minutes.  To maintain rooting interest, the film injects a shot of idealism every 20 minutes. Cruise’s Impossible Missions Force (IMF) agent, Ethan Hunt, refuses to sacrifice innocent lives for the greater good. He won’t leave any IMF agent behind. When he goes undercover with corrupt movers and shakers, he strategizes to avoid killing other law enforcers. He even apologizes to a Parisian parking cop wounded in the crossfire.  The writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie, has worked with Cruise for over a decade, writing and co-producing Valkyrie (2008) and writing and directing the previous Mission: Impossible movie, Rogue Nation (2015), as well as Jack Reacher (2012). He’s also done credited or uncredited work on the scripts for The Edge of Tomorrow (2014), The Mummy (2017), and Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011). He cleverly uses Hunt’s moral integrity as a source of suspense. We wonder, “How can he keep his conscience clean and get the job done this time?” He also knows how to keep the drama in his star’s wheelhouse, mostly by keeping him moving. McQuarrie builds extreme action and “give” into each of the film’s acts, enabling Cruise’s Hunt to test his mettle and his metal, whether he’s operating a vintage BMW sedan or a cutting-edge Airbus helicopter. Like Richard Lester’s famous 1959 comedy short, this is a running, jumping, and standing-still film—although the closest Hunt comes to standing still is when stuntman/actor Liang Yang wraps a sink-pipe around Cruise’s neck.  The movie dips into bathetic hero-worship only when it describes the toll it has taken on Hunt to divorce his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) for her protection. (Quelle surprise!) It’s not enough for that brass-tacks agent Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) to rumble Hunt’s praises. We must hear Julia herself, a humanitarian nurse, give her ex-husband credit for pushing her to lead a purposeful life. We briefly fear that the movie will turn into a Trump cabinet meeting lovefest. Will IMF agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) proclaim Ethan “the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I’ve ever known in my life?” Luckily, the filmmakers restrain themselves. The result is a spiffy, crowd-pleasing contraption. Getting a canny writer-director like McQuarrie to take the helm, twice in a row, ensures the continuity of melodrama and spectacle. His films lack the improbable lilt of Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, the hyper-personal paranoia and voyeurism of Brian De Palma’s vision in the first film, or the romanticism of the John Woo–directed, Robert Towne–scripted M:I 2. But they’re a big step up from J.J. Abrams’s typically mechanical M:I 3. For the second time, McQuarrie’s resourcefulness and energy refresh the by-now familiar tale of Hunt beating the clock to foil yet another disillusioned agent turned nihilistic madman. This time the top villain is the mysterious “John Lark,” who aims to shock our decadent global civilization into starting over. He gathers the materials to nuke three holy cities: Rome, Mecca, and, of course, Jerusalem, close to Armageddon’s original location. Lark’s atheistic credo: “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” The lunatic visionary of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), comes back into play, this time as a bargaining chip. A CIA agent named Walker, aka The Hammer (Henry Cavill), has crushed Solomon’s network of embittered ops (“the Syndicate”), making way for Lark’s apostles, who really are called “the Apostles.” Angela Bassett’s Erica Sloan, the new CIA director, orders that Walker be part of Ethan’s mission. Will Walker be competitor, friend, or foe?  The inspiration behind the big-screen M:I series has been to combine the luxurious and/or exotic surfaces of the James Bond movies with a spy vs. spy background as bleak as John le Carré’s. Secret and special services and police and security agencies compete for dominance within each country, and they work at cross-purposes on the global stage. McQuarrie puts these conflicts into sleek comic-strip form. Except for the IMF regulars, everyone’s allegiance is in doubt from the moment they show up on screen. That includes the returning British operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who was Hunt’s match in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.  One character who’s slippery to the end is the chic but lethal arms dealer known as “the White Widow,” who puts on an elegant gala as a British philanthropist in Paris when she isn’t striking dirty deals or wielding a mean butterfly knife. Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in The Crown’s first two seasons) plays her superbly and knowingly, as if in homage to another Vanessa, Redgrave. Indeed, Redgrave played the arms dealer “Max” in the first film, and, in a highly touted Easter egg, the White Widow refers to Max as her mother.  Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation) uses the giant screen to exploit the glittering nocturnal allure of Paris’s Grand Palais and the sun-kissed, sky-scraping grandeur of New Zealand’s Southern Alps (masquerading as Kashmir). He and the rest of McQuarrie’s team provide the wow factor while Cruise supplies the whoa factor, whether he’s performing aero-acrobatics during a HALO jump, hanging from tall buildings and cliff walls, or chasing a heartless enemy through perilous canyons as he tries to avert nuclear disaster. And of course we get the obligatory “See Tom run” scene, highlighting, under duress, his perfect form (tight core, efficient, air-chopping arms). Agee wrote that an ideal gag “would bring the victim up the ladder of laughs by cruelly controlled degrees to the top rung, and would then proceed to wobble, shake, wave and brandish the ladder until he groaned for mercy.” That’s what Mission: Impossible – Fallout does, too. I stayed to the final credit, in case there was a clever tag, but I didn’t feel cheated when there wasn’t one. I needed the time to catch my breath.

"Sep 8, 2018"," A triumph of action movie filmmaking, Mission: Impossible â Fallout builds  upon its well-established formula of first-class entertainment, to make for a  high stakes, high quality, and character rich, sure to be action classic. Since its inception in 1996, the Mission: Impossible film series has gone from strength to strength.  Fuelled by Tom Cruiseâs star power and fearless approach to action performance,  this once faltering franchise found its groove and its popularity after the  excellent Mission: Impossible 3, and with it the addition of JJ Abrams (Star  Wars: The Force Awakens) to the fore. Now the sixth entry, Mission: Impossible â Fallout, has  taken that winning formula of high-grade, high-stakes action scenarios, and  Cruiseâs all-in intensity, to breathtaking new heights. Exactly how Cruise and  company will follow up this one will be an impossible mission in itself.  Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (Jack  Reacher), Mission: Impossible â  Fallout finds IMF agent Etan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team Luther (Ving  Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), on the hunt for missing nuclear weapons that  have fallen in the hands of mysterious terrorist group âThe Apostlesâ, led by  Huntâs arch-nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). To make things complicated,  also on the chase for Lane is Huntâs one-time love interest, MI6 agent Ilsa  Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), and CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill.) An incredibly choreographed fight scene inside a  gentlemanâs bathroom features Cavill at his fist swinging, bone-crunching best,  trading barbs and sharing action beats with Cruise, who no doubt relished  having Superman himself in his franchise. Great too is Rebecca Ferguson, who  continues to bring that scene-stealing mix of disarming beauty and action  performance smarts to a role that very much deserves its own spin-off. McQuarrie has delivered an action movie that is as  serious as a heart attack, yet which knows how to entertain as well. Where the  likes of The Dark Knight, Skyfall and Mad Max: Fury Road have  evolved the genre to new heights, McQuarrie has successfully taken â¦Fallout to the top of the action movie  food-chain. Its action scenes are crisp, clean and incredibly well  choreographed and executed. Motor bikes, helicopters, guns, firsts, nuclear  bombsâ¦McQuarrie brings out all the action goodies for his actors to play with.  Where the whole âfate of the worldâ trump card has been played before, here  McQuarrie makes those sky-high stakes feel palpable. Having Cruise do his maverick, daredevil, action-man  shtick makes it all feel even more palpable. Outside of Jackie Chan, itâs hard  to think of a megastar actor who has placed life and limb on the line with the  same skill and intensity as Cruise. That he is also a fine actor brings more  dimensions to his Ethan Hunt, who since Mission:  Impossible III has been given an arch thatâs evolved from one successive  film to another, and hits pay dirt here. Action films are great eye-candy, this is true. But they  can also emote with the same power as your average Oscar drama. Mission: Impossible â Fallout is  another prime example of that. Here is a film of spectacle and personality,  thrills and feeling, great technical skill and fine storytelling. It just also  may be film of the year. Now that is mission accomplished! ",POSITIVE
"Sep 6, 2018"," Based on Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, Jack Reacher follows the title character (Tom Cruise), a mysterious military investigator, as he reluctantly agrees to look into the murder of several civilians by a skilled sharpshooter. There's little doubt that filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie, working from his own screenplay, does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the proceedings, as the movie kicks off with a spellbinding (and dialogue-free) stretch revolving around the aforementioned sharpshooter's attack and the subsequent initial investigation by the authorities. It's a riveting opening that paves the way for a deliberately-paced yet consistently watchable thriller that benefits substantially from Cruise's engrossing performance, as the actor effortlessly steps into the shoes of an impressively hardened figure with a propensity for random acts of violence and tough-guy posturing (eg in one of the movie's more amusing moments, Reacher tells a foe, ""I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot."") McQuarrie's leisurely modus operandi results in a midsection that does, admittedly, feel somewhat padded-out, with the procedural-like bent of the narrative ensuring that Jack Reacher, at times, resembles the pilot episode of a new cop show on TNT. And although the protracted climax isn't quite as riveting as one might've hoped, Jack Reacher is, in the end, a better-than-average modern-day thriller that hopefully marks the start of a promising new series. The Mission: Impossible series finally runs out of steam with this overlong and often superfluous entry, as writer/director Christopher McQuarrie offers up a rather forgettable narrative that's perpetuated by an atypically bland villain and a surfeit of disappointing action interludes. The needlessly convoluted storyline follows Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt as he  attempts to take down a rogue terrorist organization known as the Syndicate, with Hunt's continuing efforts both helped and hindered by Rebecca Ferguson's mysterious Ilsa Faust. There's little doubt that Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation gets off to an impressively engrossing start, as McQuarrie opens the proceedings with a thrilling sequence that sees Hunt clinging to the outside of an ascending airplane. From there, however, the film morphs into a disappointingly by-the-numbers actioner devoid of compelling attributes - with the been-there-done-that vibe amplified by an almost total absence of interesting, three-dimensional supporting characters. (Ferguson's boring turn as the movie's femme fatale is nothing compared to Sean Harris' almost astonishingly one-note portrayal of villain Solomon Lane.) The lack of momentum reaches a head as Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation limps into its climactic stretch, with the buildup to and execution of the padded-out, unusually tedious  third act ensuring that the film concludes on as underwhelming a note as one could envision - which does confirm the picture's place as a rushed and half-baked entry within an otherwise stellar franchise. A monumental improvement over 2015's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (and indeed a strong candidate for the best of the series), Mission: Impossible - Fallout follows Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt as he and his team set out to stop a diabolical villain from exploding a series of nuclear bombs. Filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie does an absolutely fantastic job of immediately drawing the viewer into the long yet never overlong proceedings, as Mission: Impossible - Fallout kicks off with an engrossing pre-credits stretch that paves the way for a mostly captivating narrative that's rife with thrilling, eye-popping action sequences - including a brutal and absolutely electrifying bathroom brawl, a series of chases through the streets of Paris, and a climactic helicopter chase that's nothing short of jaw-dropping. It's clear, too, that the picture benefits substantially from Cruise's typically charismatic and commanding turn as the series' lead figure, with the actor receiving more-than-able support from a cast of periphery performers that includes Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, and Henry Cavill. (The latter is especially effective as Ethan's combative new partner, while the decision to bring back Sean Harris as the film's central antagonist is, unfortunately, one of McQuarrie's few missteps here.) The movie's storyline is, by the standards of this notoriously convoluted franchise, pretty easy to follow, ultimately, which ensures that the viewer is absolutely invested in the protagonists' hair-raising exploits - with the final result a seriously impressive installment in this continuing series and, in the end, one of the new century's very best action films.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2018"," Even its breathers, which are mostly moments of levity or ingenious exposition, are infused with suspense and tension. It is as if each joke cracked by loyal genius Benji (Simon Pegg) or each emotional reunion with characters from the past take a toll on the success rate of the very impossible mission that Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is recruited to accomplish. The stakes are just too high for the film’s heroes to be afforded humanity. The first setpiece introduces Hunt as the unique operative who will save a comrade even if it would risk the failure of a leg of a mission. In a stand-off between him and a group of nasty plutonium sellers, his successful attempt to rescue his comrade Luther (Ving Rhames) from certain death results in the plutonium which he was supposed to recover falling into the wrong hands, unleashing nuclear explosions in various religious cities around the globe. The point of Fallout is not to introduce Hunt as a hero who can do anything and everything. Those were already done and redone in the previous films in varying degrees of success. The point of this latest installment is to make Hunt’s mission even more impossible.  He has to save the world with his integrity intact, which in this particular episode’s case, is quite difficult. He has to survive a chase through Paris’ busy streets without harming any cops. He has to ensure that August Walker (Henry Cavill), the rather annoying brute the CIA has forced into his mission, is alive after a freak accident while freefalling from a plane. His stunts here are daring. They are outrageous but never to the point of being comical. However, while there is always that sense that this installment of Mission: Impossible is still primarily a vanity project, the film at least also utilizes Cruise’s curious appeal that only reveals itself whenever he is in the losing edge.  A huge part of the pleasure derived from Doug Liman’s extremely entertaining films, The Edge of Tomorrow (2014) and American Made (2017), is seeing Cruise either perishing numerously or being under extreme duress. In Fallout, Cruise is not just truly heroic, he is also very human, susceptible to not just self-doubt but also being outmaneuvered in physical feats. In the splendidly choreographed fist fight set in a Parisian nightclub, Cruise is essentially a limp noodle in the midst of heavy-fisted Cavill and dangerously nimble stuntman Liang Yang.  McQuarrie understands that the current appeal of Cruise isn’t as an unflappable action star but as someone who needs to get tested, bested and beaten up to be truly triumphant. Anything less just wouldn’t work. In providing him a supporting team composed of characters who have their own motivations and baggage, the film grants the actor a semblance of generosity. The film’s final set-piece has Cruise’s air-bound chase share the screen with two other thrilling sequences that put his equally appealing comrades and their brushes with danger in the same spotlight as him. It is a proper climax to close a consistently exhilarating adventure that puts three-way thrills above star-power.  It is an action film where humanity trumps spectacle. Exploding buildings are rare. Destruction is kept to a bare minimum. Everything is comprehensible, following a distinct order that is not only physically probably but more importantly, narratively and emotionally logical.  Francis Joseph Cruz litigates for a living and writes about cinema for fun. The first Filipino movie he saw in the theaters was Carlo J. Caparas’ Tirad Pass.",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2018"," MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is one of the best entries in the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE franchise. Unfortunately, that’s not necessarily saying much, so let’s put it another way. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is actually entertaining. It moves briskly, it has at least one sequence with helicopters that shows us something new, and it puts one over on the audience at least once. One might think this is due to writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Outstanding Original Screenplay Oscar for his 1995 THE USUAL SUSPECTS script. However, McQuarrie also wrote and directed 2015’s MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – ROGUE NATION, FALLOUT’s immediate predecessor, which was not nearly as fun. Maybe something behind the scenes changed, maybe it just took this long to set up the dominoes, maybe it was getting to play with the helicopters. In any event, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is the kind of movie that gives franchises a good name, providing the familiar elements and characters that we like with enough novelty and energy that we’re happy to be back for another go-round. An outstanding first scene shows us that our superspy hero Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, back for his sixth go-round) is feeling understandable and deserved guilt about his marriage to Julia (Michelle Monaghan), a civilian who’s had to go into hiding because of her husband’s enemies. Meanwhile, duty calls. In trying to take down the rest of the terrorist group they tangled with in ROGUE NATION, Ethan and his friends Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) try to get their hands on some plutonium to keep it away from the bad guys. This doesn’t quite work out. Erstwhile government nemesis Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) is now on Ethan’s side, but new CIA boss Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) puts one of her agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill), on the team to ensure that the next operation is by the book. No guesses on how that works out. Old MI-6 frenemy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns, still pursuing her own agenda, and destructive anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is also back as a human maguffin. An arms broker called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is part of the new mix. The action in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT bounces around the world, with major set pieces in France and India, the latter including that extraordinary helicopter sequence. There is a lot of fun to be had in watching the stunts and the staging, but this time around, there’s also a lot more pleasure in watching the characters acknowledge the absurdity of what they’re doing without breaking the fourth wall or the tone. While still exuding the kind of determination that makes him a little scary, even Cruise gets a few lighter moments here. Rhames and Pegg are invaluable support, and Baldwin appears to be enjoying himself when Hunley is allowed into the mix. Ferguson once more seems hyper-capable. Turning to the franchise newcomers, Cavill plays exasperation delightfully. Kirby is fascinating as the up-for-anything Widow. Bassett gives Sloan an attitude that suggests she’d prefer not to get into the muck, but if the agents mess up so badly that she must personally intervene, she will single-handedly knock all of them back into last week. While MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is a direct sequel to ROGUE NATION, there are a few loose ends. With all the bonding and teamwork, it seems odd that there’s not even a mention of Jeremy Renner’s William Brandt, and with all the kerfuffle surrounding another character, it stretches credibility (even by MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE standards) that Ethan would be so totally out of the loop. This said, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is a superior specimen. It doesn’t transcend being part of its formula summer action franchise genre, but it’s certainly one of the better current examples of the breed.",POSITIVE

"Aug 27, 2018"," Tom Cruise's long-running Mission: Impossible franchise is expected to deliver a few things at this point. You'll get insane, hair-raising stunt sequences with Cruise himself doing much of the legwork, Cruise running a lot on foot and flashing his famous smile — though in fairness he does both in every film he's part of — well-choreographed fights, and a bunch of spy gobbledygook that propels the plot twists which string together much of the action. All that laid over the instantly-recognisable Mission: Impossible theme, first composed by Lalo Schifrin and that has since seen renditions delivered by the likes of Hans Zimmer and Michael Giacchino, among others. But the latest instalment — titled Mission: Impossible – Fallout, out July 27 in India — opts for something unexpected: a more sombre tone. It's made evident by the opening scenes of the film, which begins with a nightmare for our protagonist IMF operative Ethan Hunt (Cruise), and then jumps into a failed op that hands three plutonium bomb cores to a faceless enemy, which in turn drives the entirety of the film's plot as Hunt and his team — Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell) — struggle to retrieve them before they are weaponised. The biggest change though isn't visual but auditory, as the M:I theme is subdued and barely registers. It's a curious move on part of writer-director Christopher McQuarrie — the first guy to return at the helm in the franchise's history — given the uptick in critical reception and improved commercial success Mission: Impossible has enjoyed since Pixar virtuoso Brad Bird (Incredibles 2) put his touch on the series with 2011's Ghost Protocol. Here, Cruise's Hunt isn't smiling his way out of missions anymore, with Fallout also toning down Benji's comedy-of-errors in addition to the volume of background music, to really let you feel the impact of the action that's unfolding in front of your eyes. Thanks to the returning McQuarrie, Fallout is also the first direct sequel in the Mission: Impossible franchise — usually seen as a series of standalone adventures — picking up the story being told in 2015's Rogue Nation and bringing back most of the characters involved in it. That's not to say you need to watch the previous chapter, with Fallout delivering the necessary exposition dump — while former MI6 agent turned terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) sits in custody, his cohorts have banded into a new group — as part of a self-destructing tape message. Hunt's failure to secure the aforementioned plutonium invites scrutiny and leads to his team being assigned a supervisor in CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), who tags along everywhere. Their mission turns into a globe-trotting experience, involving Paris, London, and Kashmir^, with New Zealand and Norway standing in for the last of those owing to challenges of filming permissions. Familiar faces and new ones crop up along the way: Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the former MI6 agent who helped Hunt previously shows up out of the blue with her own mission, while The Crown's Vanessa Kirby is introduced as a black-market arms broker known only by her nickname, White Widow. Meanwhile, Fallout probes and examines Hunt as a character, with the film's title seeming to reckon with the legacy of his actions — “the fallout of all your good intentions,” as Lane says at one point — and referencing the ultimate by-product of those plutonium bomb cores. (^ Kashmir is chosen for its political significance, but it's only a superficial connect, as not a single individual of local ethnicity appears on-screen, while all the spoken references to the region have been removed by the CBFC, India's film certification body that also acts as a censor.) Though its new solemn approach and the heavy cloud — three potential nuclear bombs in the wind — that hangs over the film offer a good backdrop to explore those ideas, Fallout doesn't probe too deep into Hunt's necessity and problems or the surrounding geopolitics. This is a Mission: Impossible entry after all and it has where it counts, offering thrilling action set-pieces throughout. With nearly all running into double-digit minutes, the attention to level of detail and the commitment to top what came before is astounding. And thanks to an always-willing partner in Cruise, who insists on doing his own stunts no matter how crazy even at the age of 56 — he broke his ankle during filming and was back in seven weeks — the camera can move in close and stay there without cutting away. Working with Ex Machina and Annihilation cinematographer Rob Hardy, McQuarrie uses that advantage to maximum effect in the new Mission: Impossible, crafting sequences that are both exhilarating and coherent, with the action in full-view and not accentuated by unnecessary use of shaky-cam and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The film also stays away from Hollywood's overuse of quick editing cuts during combat, in lieu of longer shots that let you see the full stunt. And since the background music is kept to a minimum, the audience can feel the weight of each blow, making it more tense, brutal, and captivating. Moreover, much of the action in Fallout is shot during the day outdoors or in well-lit interiors, unlike most action films — including some previous Mission: Impossible films — which prefer night-time, where you can get away with a lot. That provides a clear look at what's happening and understand some well-devised and truly impressive shots, including one of water turning into a formidable wall as a police truck sinks into the river, which drew applause at the Indian premiere for its execution. But it's the sheer variety of sequences on display that makes Fallout so enthralling, including edge-of-the-seat motorcycle and car chases, running on and jumping across rooftops, and an extended dogfight between two non-military helicopters. It's Cruise's dedication to do them himself that turns the excitement-meter up by a few notches, which does mean an unbelievable amount of work for the actor. McQuarrie revealed that Cruise spent 16 hours a day for six weeks to get a license for the helicopters, because they didn't have enough time and he wanted to fly it. And for the first action scene, a crazy long take where Hunt performs a HALO jump and then saves someone during the dive, Cruise and the cameraman jumped out of the plane 106 times — take a moment to let that sink in — because the director and the actor wanted to shoot at dusk, which gave them just three minutes of light each day. It's a stunning sequence that must be seen to be fully appreciated. All together, they contribute towards an entertaining flick — the best action film of this year so far — one that carries a lot of twists and turns in its convoluted narrative without amounting to much. In the end, Mission: Impossible – Fallout reaffirms the need for an individual like Hunt, who's willing to risk his life, doesn't listen when someone tells him to stop, and is unable to compromise. In all those ways, the character is an embodiment of Cruise as an actor. It's impossible to tell how many more instalments we'll get in the series — this is just the sixth entry released in the last 22 years — but if it can keep delivering brilliant action set-pieces as it evolves in such capable hands, there's no reason why it can't keep running, just like Cruise.",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2018"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a testament to the miracle that is Tom Cruise. Cruise is among Hollywood's last surviving superstars. And yet look at what this man is willing to endure to entertain us. In this film, he breaks his ankle – for real, leaps out of a plane at 25,000 feet, hangs from a helicopter and flies it, drives a high-speed motorcycle through Paris, leaps from innumerable terraces and runs so fast and so hard that I got exhausted just looking at him. Did I mention that he is 56? Here Cruise once again partners with Christopher McQuarrie, who is the first director to helm two films in the 22-year-old Mission: Impossible franchise. McQuarrie, who earlier directed Rogue Nation, makes the action set-pieces grander and even more bonkers. He also adds emotional heft. Ethan Hunt's inherent goodness and sincerity become genuinely moving. Strands from Hunt's past are woven into the story – he is vulnerable and in places, even frail. The film acknowledges Cruise's years. Despite the physical prowess, we see him tiring as he fights. We see him get beat up. We see his white stubble. We recognize that he is human. And yet, when Luther says of Hunt, 'He will get it done', we don't doubt it for a second. Because since the first Mission: Impossible in 1996, Hunt has never let us down. That first film was my favorite in the series. None of the subsequent installments were duds but the memory of these films started to blur. I started to identify them by the stunts – so Ghost Protocol was the one in which Cruise climbed the Burj Khalifa and in Rogue Nation, he was hanging from the side of a plane. But Fallout is an absolute knockout.  This film is a staggering action spectacle and easily the best since the first. The story revolves around homicidal terrorists who get their hands on plutonium. These folks want to wreak havoc on the world because they believe that the greater the pain, the greater the peace. But Hunt gets in the way. He is relentless in his pursuit. He is also unfailing in his mission to protect – the film establishes clearly that this man isn't willing to compromise a single life, even for the larger good of humanity. This 'pathetic morality,' can sometimes be a stumbling block. But it is what makes Hunt who he is. McQuarrie, who has also written the screenplay, skillfully alternates the emotion with action. Some of which is so propulsive and insane that it makes you gasp – one jaw-dropping sequence takes place in a pristine white bathroom, which eventually becomes stained with blood. I knew Hunt would come out okay and yet the climax, which involves ticking bombs, helicopters and snowy mountain cliffs, is so suspenseful that I was actually squealing loudly. Incidentally the sequence is supposed to be set in Kashmir but here New Zealand is filling in and we get barely any sense that we are in India.  At two and half hours, Fallout is also a tad too long. Apart from Cruise, the film is bolstered by the usual suspects – Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg playing Hunt's team members. There's also a trio of fabulous women – Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan and Angela Bassett, who plays the CIA director. At one point, she disdainfully declares: IMF is Halloween – a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat. There's also Henry Cavill, showing us that he can do much more than be Superman.",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2018","Much of our enjoyment of the Mission: Impossible series is derived from the fact that filmmakers continue to challenge Cruise's ageing body and our ageing minds - and by extension, the traditional core of action filmmaking.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 27, 2018"," The former leader of a group of rogue agents seeking to unite people against unchecked government oversight—a cause worthy of pause if not for the terrorist acts of genocide utilized to achieve this goal—speaks to the man who caught him with confidence about how he’s worked to ensure the price of that “hero’s” good intentions will soon be paid in full. We wonder how this is possible considering Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was captured by Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) two in-film years ago, spending every second since in custody on an international tour of nations hungry for their pound of flesh. But we hear those words and look around. We see everyone Hunt has loved in close proximity and a nuclear bomb that cannot be disengaged. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has therefore done with Mission: Impossible – Fallout what the team behind James Bond’s Spectre couldn’t. Rather than scramble to retrofit the great mysteries and missions of previous installments to solidify a master villain conveniently pulling all the strings, McQuarrie builds upon them. He looks back at what has defined Hunt’s actions in the past five films, understanding the answer to be humanity. In a profession where death is virtually assured and sacrifices literal prerequisites, this man has done everything in his power to both save the world at-large and protect those closest to him. It began when his parents were leveraged in the first and cemented in the third with the kidnapping of his fiancé. Lane’s vengeance isn’t therefore apocalypse. It’s simply dismantling Hunt’s soul. So in a franchise that’s defined itself by always going bigger with its sprawling casts, insane stunts, and exotic locales, McQuarrie somehow finds a way to retreat within the spectacle. He can afford to do this because he set-up the fact that the toughest enemy we face is ourselves. It’s no coincidence that Rogue Nation and now Fallout prove far and away the best entries in this series. They’ve earned that status by focusing upon villains who aren’t much different than Ethan himself. Lane and his “Syndicate” are all former operatives turned by a cynicism unable to let them see their work as more than government-motivated power plays without true meaning beyond nationalistic superiority. They see their lives as empty, their purpose stolen. They see a world enslaved. Hunt has yet to lose his purpose. While his actions are for the good of many, his real motivation is saving those he loves. Staving off massive annihilation is a means to an end because he cares about the people trapped in the crosshairs. This is why CIA Director Sloan (Angela Bassett) calls him a scalpel rather than hammer (like her best assassin, Henry Cavill‘s August Walker). He still acknowledges the difference between innocents and monsters enough to try his hardest to minimize collateral damage even if it makes his cover impossible to sustain. Some would say it’s a weakness—the only reason the new leader of Lane’s former network (now coined the “Apostles”) has plutonium is because Hunt wouldn’t let his friend die. Others call it strength. This film looks to discover which is true. Is Hunt’s innate desire to hold onto attachments a liability towards completing his missions or a motivation for the tenacity necessary to never stop pushing forward until achieving success? McQuarrie isn’t going to make discovering that answer easy as everything has come back to force Hunt into making decisions he does not want to make. Should he save a man he knows is going to cause trouble in the future? Should he free the worst foe he’s ever defeated in order to get closer to the one currently threatening to destroy everything? Should he trust a former ally whose mission is in direct opposition to his own? What makes Ethan Hunt great is that he weighs these options at all. But those questions are also being manipulated. They’re being thrust upon him in order to see whether he will break. Because think about it: the airtight plans on behalf of the unknown John Lark are poised to defeat Hunt’s body or mind. Either he succumbs to the nuclear blast or he survives to find everyone else dead. Either he dies trying to uphold his code or he confronts the pain it has wrought. So maybe Hunt dies or maybe he becomes the next Solomon Lane. To the latter it’s a victory regardless. And that’s why Ethan must rely on those he’s willing to die for despite wishing they could be anywhere else under a shroud of safety. His feelings are born from his trust in them. This means that Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) have never been more crucial to success both in their duties on the job and their faith in and from their fearless leader. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is going to need to be leaned upon even if she’s also positioned to throw a wrench in their plans because Hunt’s team showed her there’s always more than just the mission. Even IMF Director Hunley (Alec Baldwin) gets involved beyond his desk duties back in America. All hands are literally on deck as pieces are moved out of Hunt’s sightlines by nefarious figures he knows (the CIA’s Sloan and Walker, Vanessa Kirby‘s black market broker “White Widow”) and those he doesn’t (the “Apostles”). And the clock is ticking. The result is a pulse-pounding affair that’s easily the franchise’s tightest. You don’t often say that about a two-and-a-half hour runtime, but it’s true because I can’t think of one second to trim. It also excels in its fallibility—Mission: Impossible as a cinematic entity always has. The infamous bathroom scene pitting Hunt and Walker against Liang Yang‘s formidable opponent is so unforgettable because the former duo gets trounced more often than not. We can feel each punch and kick, wholly cognizant of the labored breathing and chance of failure despite our brains knowing it’s way too early in the film to not have them prevail. The same goes for a glorious automotive chase with imperfect results. Thinking on the fly is key because no plan is flawless. And because we’re really delving into what makes Hunt operate differently than rogue agents who’ve been burned less times than he, McQuarrie is able to share more details about his life and what happened with Julia (Michelle Monaghan) between M:I III and Ghost Protocol. We therefore get to see him at his most vulnerable emotionally as well as physically (no matter how in-shape Cruise remains, age can’t be ignored as a factor). I think it’s that physicality that resonates most because it highlights his perseverance. Where skill got him out of situations in the past, he needs mettle and desperation here. To possess that sense of humanity alongside its slickness in style is why this series has endured and hopefully will continue to do so in the future.",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2018","It is a great continuation to Rogue Nation. While it's not as good as Rogue Nation, I will say that it is definitely Worth Watching.",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2018"," The word wow was created for films like Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the sterling sixth entry in the franchise led by Tom Cruise. It’s thrilling in all the right ways, inventive in many others, and the perfect summer blockbuster film. If you were worried the franchise might be showing its age, let me assuage your fears, it’s fantastic.  Fallout finds Ethan Hunt at his most desperate. He’s captured the leader of the Syndicate but after a mission gone wrong, it seems like that won’t matter. Plutonium that could power three nuclear bombs is in the wind and the IMF (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) have to get it back. Complicating manners are Walker (Henry Cavil), the CIA’s hired man, who has to join the team and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who seems to have a mission of her own. As the clock starts ticking on the mission, the stakes rise and alliances begin to fall apart. When all things are said and done, and we look back on movie history, Tom Cruise will have to be among the pantheon of the stars of the modern era. He is at his Tom Cruise-iest here, giving us epic action but also not skimping on showing us a bit of his range as a dramatic actor (I want him to do a juicy drama so bad, but will have to settle for glimpses for the time being). He’s perhaps able to be so great in this movie because he gets to play off a wonderful supporting cast. The sly charm and physical brutality of Henry Cavil has been used to great effect in many films, and McQuarrie knew what to do with him here. Cavil plays his role with an ease that alludes him in his more famous blockbuster role and almost walks away with the movie. For a franchise that seems all about the men, the women get some ample screen time and great moments, especially Vanessa Kirby, whose broker character seems tailor made for her acting talents. Rebecca Fergusson, the most memorable part of Rogue Nation, brings a surprising amount of heart to the proceedings given her history and still kicks major ass. Every actor got at least one standout moment, yet these never felt like they took away from the momentum because the script of Mission: Impossible – Fallout is so sharp. This movie manages to be logical even as people cross and double cross each other, tight enough to move the set pieces, and is also incredibly funny, with many of the series’ long running gags present and accounted for.  Every element from the acting to the script to the technical aspects are all handled masterfully by Christopher McQuarrie. As the first director to return to the franchise, and the one who directed one of it’s least memorable entries, McQ, as he is called, had a lot riding on this movie. From the first moments, he makes his mark on the franchise and continues to do so throughout the movie. His eye for action might be unmatched and you MUST see this movie on the biggest screen possible to pay witness to the incredible action direction he’s doing (the Imax sequences are breathtaking). There’s nothing more to say about this film other than Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the summer blockbuster we dream about seeing and is worth every penny.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2018"," Mission Impossible is the greatest film franchise in cinematic history. What other series has had the consistent quality? None (well, maybe The Thin Man). Each film, since Tom Cruise‘s Ethan Hunt first graced the screen, has been better than the last. Each film, carries with it a new height of dare-devil exploits. Indeed, the second half of the series, the 4-6 trilogy could vie as one of the best trilogies ever. Much like James Bond, Mission Impossible‘s stories are simple. They rely on the same tropes and themes to get by, but more so than Bond, Mission Impossible has been more capable of twisting our expectations to create can’t miss blockbusters that haven’t worn thin. The opening to Mission Impossible: Fallout is a barrage of exposition. From a projected reel of film hidden, we learn that Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has teamed with a shadowy terrorist with no known identity, except the pseudonym John Lark. They have stolen plutonium and plan to detonate it, thereby causing the collapse of the Old World Order and, in the process, helping a cell of doomsayers known as the Apostles. Hunt’s mission, should he choose to accept it, is to track down the stolen plutonium. The actors, together for their third film, are comfortable in each other’s pockets. Fallout is a true sequel to Rogue Nation, so while you will be able to comfortably view the film, you may need a tiny bit of catch up. Nevertheless, the script plants plenty of clues for you to keep up. Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), and Hunt are a perfect trio, and the film is actually quite funny. The banter between these three provide levity in an action film that brings near non-stop intensity. They’re joined by a CIA operative named August Walker (Henry Cavill). Cavill, as the bulldozer in a suit assigned to Hunt’s team, demonstrates an ice-cold persona and a stylin’ stash. They’re opposed by the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a take the best deal there is femme fatale. Fallout also marks the return of Rebecca Ferguson‘s Ilsa. Fallout, for all of its action, is stylistically immaculate. In fact, it can be a quiet and nearly silent film, with a rapacious and eerie string-laden score accompanying certain sequences. The sound design is technical perfection. These scenes, and the action accompanying, are so well choreographed the results are dizzying. The stunts are pristine and seamless and the fighting choreography is targeted and pinned to the very millisecond. Many of these stunt sequences are going to be “ohh’d” and “aww’d” for sometime, from the building jumping scene, to the skydiving sequence, the helicopter chase, and the bathroom tussle (that phrase sounded better in my head). Fallout is worth it just for these moments, never mind the story. And well, the story is solid. It is your typical Mission Impossible tale, as these spies jet from Belfast, to Berlin, Paris, and London. However, that tale is only the bare bones of the script. The elements are so familiar to us that it’s a genre unto itself. Screenwriter and director Christopher McQuarrie plays on these tropes and elements to surprise us and to question their very existences. Hunt has always operated in a world where he can be burned at any second, where friends can quickly become foes. Nevertheless, those foes have always existed for the benefit of a country. Now, we know of no benefit. Indeed, the villains here: John Lark, the Widow, Solomon Lane and his Apostles work for no country, no government agency. They work for themselves. The entirety of the film becomes a checkmate barrage as double and triple crosses occur to the point of it being an impossibility to keep up. And the concept isn’t foreign (no pun intended, and certainly not a knock against Fallout). We can trace this new trope, soldiers without allegiances within the spy genre, back to Skyfall. Fallout owes much to Skyfall, and not just the word “fall.” There are several scenes that have clearly been reinvented. As stated prior, they continue the war without borders motif. That is, in this digital world we don’t know who our enemies are. And both MI6 in Skyfall and IMF in Fallout are considered outdated for their times. “IMF is a bunch of kids in Halloween masks,” quips Sloan (Angela Bassett), head of the CIA. Fallout even borrows the underground caverns setting, or the Churchill bunker tunnels in Skyfall, through much of the film. They both combine the old with the new. If there’s one difference between Skyfall and Fallout, it’s the cinematography. Skyfall was a brightly lit film, even in the manor scenes. The color and lighting was vivid and crisp. Fallout‘s cinematography is murky and diffused. It follows the same blurred lines as the operatives at its center. And while Hunt is never the forlorn rundown that is Daniel Craig’s Bond, he is damaged. Much like Craig’s Bond, he’s tired of losing, losing those close to him, losing a normal life. However, he’s never able to walk away. Bond usually comes back because he’s a natural born killer. He’s good at it. Hunt returns because he has a Superman complex, a moral complex. Hunt is a modern-day Superman. Yes, that’s an easy comparison considering Cavill’s involvement in the film, but Hunt displays the same traits. Hunt is self-sacrificial, believes the one life to be as important as the million, and leaps tall buildings in a single bound. Seriously! As Hunt chases Lane, he leaps from building-to-building, at times, running faster than a speeding bullet. Nevertheless, he’s a humanistic Superman. He becomes battered and bruised, yet is unrelenting. While Superman is an unachievable goal for mere mortals, made to demonstrate human perfection, Hunt is the mortal equivalence, giving hope for the mere fact of being human. And much like Luther, we implicitly trust that he will succeed. And while watching a 56 year-old Cruise perform harrowing stunt after harrowing stunt, we’re left in amazement. We may even bemuse what may happen when Cruise must walk away (then again Harrison Ford is suiting up as Indiana Jones at 78). Still, Cruise brings a blockbuster stardom that’s rarely seen today. He’s always a 10 kilowatt smile away from a massive hit, even in the Autumn of his career. If you will, his magnetism always points north. The series has seen consistent quality. In fact, many, including myself, would argue that the quality has only increased from film-to-film. Much of that is down to Cruise, who still finds exuberance and passion in a role he’s occupied for 22 years. Indeed, the series has never had a dud, and with Mission Impossible: Fallout, Cruise has carried another new chapter in the greatest film franchise in the history of cinema.",POSITIVE

"Aug 24, 2018"," Now this is a summer action movie. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” knows what it has to do to deliver and does it exceedingly well. The story is a mere vehicle for the astounding action sequences, breathtaking stunts and white-knuckled fights, but it’s never lame. One heart-stopping scene follows another, with a plot that is fine-tuned, and at heart not too implausible. Like the James Bond movies, this is a franchise that endlessly recharges itself by staying imaginative and crafty. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, delivering his second title for the series, has made a thriller combining an old school sensibility with a scope that works best in the IMAX format. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is back and remains haunted by recent events, especially the separation with his wife. He and his IMF team, including Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg), and boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), face a new threat when an underground terrorist group, known as The Apostles, hijack a cache of plutonium. The group is loyal to anarchist revolutionary Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who Hunt captured in the previous movie, “Rogue Nation.” Lane remains imprisoned in France but his acolytes remain loyal to the idea of destroying the current world order. After an attempt at getting the plutonium goes wrong, Hunt and the team devise a new plan to infiltrate Paris, grab Lane and stop The Apostles. With the CIA already suspicious of Hunt, enigmatic agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) is sent to keep tabs, to the annoyance of Hunt of course. The two agents sky dive into France and make contact with a mysterious arranger known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who they will try to con into helping them get to Lane. But not everything is as it seems and what begins as a simple mission turns into a cat and mouse chase where identities can’t be trusted. Complicating matters further is the sudden reappearance of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has a complicated, romantic history with Hunt and who also seeks Lane, to bring him back to the United Kingdom. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” works like a shot of adrenaline that only slows down to let the story breathe and develop. This is the sixth movie in a franchise already running for 22 years, but it knows how to recharge with a genre and setting designed to last long. Unlike the “Fast & The Furious” movies, which have to figure out what to do next with a gang of car thieves, “Mission: Impossible” is all about espionage in an ever changing world. McQuarrie’s script for “Fallout” features all the little details we recognize in this series, including the delivered self-destructing messages, concealed gadgets to knock someone out and the iconic face disguises (watch out for a certain celebrity cameo early on). But everything is revived in new, grand sequences.  The dynamic action scenes McQuarrie has crafted tie the whole film together, one major sequence leading to the next chapter and so on. Great action films leave moments and images imbedded in our minds and “Fallout” has some great ones, where the big stunts are still given some humor. A skydiving scene into Paris has an absorbing, widescreen scope that is just one example of why this is a perfect IMAX movie (many of the action sequences are shot in the screen ratio of the massive format). After sniping at each other on the plane, Hunt and Walker dive into a threatening sky where lightning can zap even an action hero. A bathroom brawl at a French rave has bone-crunching intensity mixed with a laugh or two, especially during one moment where Cruise looks tired when he realizes he needs to tango some more with the villain, because it must be hard to still be taking down terrorists at 56. Indeed, part of this film’s impressiveness comes from how real and big all the stunts are, with Cruise still doing them himself. Can he truly ride a helicopter into a dogfight above rugged mountain peaks, sprint endlessly through windows, ride a motorcycle and dive into a manhole? Like all great action stars, he makes us believe he can. Sean Connery was still breaking into Alcatraz in his late 60s for Michael Bay, so Cruise still has many miles left, at least with this series.  A car and motorcycle chase sequence when Hunt and his team try to grab Lane is one of the year’s great sustained action scenes, building up energy without resorting to bombastic CGI tricks. If “Fallout” is riveting as an action piece, as a thriller it tells its story in the tradition of good spy yarns. In a year of superheroes and intergalactic warlords, here is a robust entertainment with human villains and believable schemes. Fanatics want nuclear weapons to spark global chaos, something not too far-fetched. Suspense comes from those good old tricks of snooping out double identities, figuring out who’s a traitor, and eventually racing against a ticking timer. Cruise is all coolness, while regretting past mistakes, Cavill is less charismatic but is a good addition with his clenched expression, perfect for an assassin. Vanessa Kirby’s White Widow floats with seductive mystery. McQuarrie films these faces and the action surrounding them with a classic look, almost reminiscent of 1970s thrillers. The movie moves fast but isn’t edited like a music video. Cinematographer Rob Hardy, who also shot the recent, hypnotic “Annihilation,” here uses a widescreen canvas to beautiful effect. The score by Lorne Balf avoids electronics, going for a large, symphonic sound.  “Fallout” is about two and a half hours long, but McQarrie is so good at throwing one twist after another, all of it racing ahead with his big sequences, that we hardly notice. It is a reminder of how a big action movie doesn’t always need capes or spaceships, just a good story and real suspense.",POSITIVE

"Aug 24, 2018"," It’s the sixth outing for the Mission: Impossible franchise, yet rather than becoming lazy and stale the exploits of Ethan Hunt are still proving thrilling to fans – perhaps more so than ever. Our resident Mission: Impossible expert Bertie awarded Fallout five stars out of five, dubbing it the year’s “must-see marvel” and declaring director Christoper McQuarrie’s second entry to the franchise not only the best Mission: Impossible movie yet, but the “greatest entry” to the entire genre it represents: “Bond and Bourne – both evoked throughout – no longer have a scratch on Ethan Hunt“. 22 years in, the Mission: Impossible franchise may have reached peak entertainment. The premise is a series standard and therefore delightfully familiar, but the stakes facing Hunt and co. are raised at a breakneck pace, with double-crosses and death-defying chase scenes coming thick and fast. The antics should be ridiculous – somehow they manage to out-do and out-stunt previous installments – but full commitment of cast members old and new(special mention to Simon Pegg and Angela Bassett), and the creative team (helmed by Rogue Nation’s Christopher McQuarrie), keep viewers hooked to the screen with a balance of apocalyptic threat and tongue-in-cheek levity. Fallout defies description. The latest entry in Hollywood’s most competently-made, dependable action franchise, expectations were solid but not buoyant. Going in, a healthy pinch of salt was probably recommended to stave off the early rave reviews. But what unfolds before you over two-plus hours is something truly transcendent and increasingly elusive – true, pure cinematic thrills. With bathroom punch-ups, helicopter chases, Southbank parkour and head-spinning halo jumps, Fallout constantly stretches to one-up itself and consistently succeeds. Coherent plot be damned, the psychotic Cruise and his team of enablers have conspired here to create a true masterpiece. The first director to return to the series, Christopher McQuarrie seems hellbent on outdoing himself. The plot at its centre is fun, holding together each increasingly ambitious set piece with plenty of betrayals and mask shenanigans. Speaking of those set pieces, they’re truly astonishing pieces of work built by people nearly as insane as Cruise. An early sequence, the HALO jump over Paris, was achieved through a single camera operator falling from 20,000 feet. This commitment lends Mission: Impossible – Fallout a tangibility that not many action films can claim, and it feels monumental; the crowning moment of the most consistently great action franchise. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is one hell of a ride. With three movies’ worth of climaxes in one, the film fills pretty much every minute with some death-defying set piece that Tom Cruise has roped Christopher McQuarrie into directing, which he does with a confident hand that builds on what he achieved with Rogue Nation. Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson and Henry Cavill play the standout characters, and work together to provide a truly thrilling experience and, for a franchise you’d expect to be wearing thin by now, a plot that delivers a surprising amount of twists and turns. See it on the biggest screen possible. Hyperbole is the greatest failing of any critic. Thankfully, every drip and drop of praise for Mission: Impossible – Fallout is justified, deserved and factual. Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie have delivered us the film of the summer. Mad Max: Fury Road reset the potential of the blockbuster, with an artistic flair and madness never before seen; M:I 6 can be considered in the same class. A film that will redefine how future movies are made, this is exhilarating, bold, boundary-pushing filmmaking with a star and writer-director giving their everything for us. The bar has just been reset. Your move, everybody else.",POSITIVE
"Aug 23, 2018","A solid entry into the Mission Impossible franchise, with Cruise once again proving that he's still as charismatic as ever in front of the camera. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to buckle in for one hell of an action-packed ride.",POSITIVE

"Aug 22, 2018"," Tom Cruise hangs in there for the sixth installment in the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” where Ethan Hunt and his IMF team have to race against time after a mission gone wrong. Whether you’re an action flick fan or not, Tom Cruise’s newest “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is one impressive film worth seeing not just on the big screen, but in IMAX, if possible. With mind-boggling stunts that Cruise actually performed to just as stunningly acrobatic cinematography, you can forgive the story — and dialogue-light, predictable double-crossing narrative, as well as the very long running time of 2 hours and 27 minutes. This is Cruise’s sixth appearance as the dashingly tough IMF Agent Ethan Hunt. More than 20 years since the original film, Cruise is going stronger than ever, performing death-defying stunts as his character races against time to save the world and his team. Of course, there’s a love story interwoven into the film as his heart will always belong to Julia (Michelle Monaghan). In “Fallout,” Hunt must find all the plutonium spheres that are being traded on the black market to a group of renegades called the Apostles, led by an unfaced man named John Lark who threatens to bring on the apocalypse. After failing to deliver the goods on a botched mission, Hunt is joined by Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), whose methods vary in accomplishing his tasks. With the help of Benji’s (Simon Pegg) extraordinary computer skills and the selflessness of Luther’s (Ving Rhames) persona, their mission just might be possible, but there will be a lot of blood shed. Fans of the television series “Mission: Impossible,” as well as the movie franchise, will be comforted to know many of the elements that make “Mission: Impossible” memorable are still there, never losing the personality of the original show. Humor and irony are expertly placed, always keeping the pace, but providing a bit of levity to the dark and dire circumstances. While the film is an action flick, and it packs a powerful punch with each and every mesmerizing scene, there are certain aspects of the story that have a religious overtone. Use of terms and concepts such as the Apostles, an apocalypse, denial, suffering and redemption, and three holy cities meeting their demise, creates a very basic good versus evil scenario. The cast is outstanding with Pegg providing humor and Rhames giving audiences a dose of love and loyalty in his performance. Even Wolf Blitzer gives us a chuckle as he builds his acting resume. Cavill sheds his superhero cape to become a believable agent, able to fend off any attacker in any location. One of the most impressive fight scenes takes place in a men’s room with shockingly precise acrobatics and the use of drainpipes as weapons. The sheer athleticism in the entire film from each and every actor will leave you awestruck. The standout, not surprisingly, is Cruise. Riding a motorcycle in Paris against traffic at high speeds, jumping from and running along rooftops and dangling from a rope on the runner of a helicopter are just a few examples of the real stunts performed by this talented actor. He even flew the helicopter through the narrow mountain range. Equalling Cruise’s stunts are the camera angles and footage captured, which all create remarkable tension as you hold your breath. The element of reality brings an even greater amount of tension to the film, knowing that death easily could have been the result of any one of the myriad number of stunts Cruise completed. While all of these components create a great cinematic and intense action thriller, the story is filled with a few inexplicable events and preposterous crossings and double-crossings ... but that’s to be expected. And the reactions of women toward Hunt will make your eyes roll, but not to worry, because the next amazing stunt is literally just around the corner. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is a mind-blowing, intense action film filled with the most dangerously impossible stunts performed by Cruise. While the story is simply ludicrous, the sensational camera work and action more than make up for it. See it in the theater for the full effect of the cinematography and locations.",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2018"," “Fallout” makes an ideal title for Christopher McQuarrie's sixth entry in the “Mission: Impossible” series because Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt executes forceful fight scenes and spectacular stunts with such visceral panache that you might just might fall out of your seat. Here, Cruise blows way past James Bond and now earns comparison to the legendary Jackie Chan for sheer athleticism and astonishing, impossible stunts. (Both stars have broken their bones for their martial art.) Granted, Chan performs without green screens or body wires. Still, Cruise's commitment to depriving stunt-doubles of employment pays off with an action experience rivaling the best of the series, Brad Bird's “Ghost Protocol.” Near the start of “Fallout,” McQuarrie's cagey screenplay pays nostalgic homage to Bruce Geller's 1960s TV series by condensing the equivalent of an hourlong episode into a single sequence designed by the IMF (Impossible Missions Force) to crack a phone code. The IMF must recover three stolen plutonium cores that an arms dealer named Lark and a terrorist group called The Apostles intend to use in bombs they'll detonate in the world's holiest of places - The Vatican, Mecca and Jerusalem - to reshape what they consider to be a corrupt world. Hunt and fellow IMF members Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), under the supervision of Alec Baldwin's supportive U.S. Secretary (of what? Suicidal Missions Unapproved by Congress or the President?), chase leads while dealing with an old enemy, Lane (Sean Harris, who tried to wipe out the IMF in McQuarrie's “Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation”). CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) insists Hunt be accompanied by Agent August Walker (emotionally opaque Superman star Henry Cavill), who thinks Hunt has turned against the agency. “Fallout” employs a sparing, self-effacing sense of humor, and delves into Hunt's personal life, even sharing his revealing dreams, such as one in which Hunt exchanges embarrassingly honest wedding vows with Julia (Michelle Monaghan), his ex-wife. Julia becomes the other woman in Hunt's life, along with spunky MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), stuck in the bad position of being ordered to kill Hunt when officials suspect he's gone rogue. Again. You hear the phrase “I'm working on it” uttered several times in “Fallout.” McQuarrie wisely creates a sense of spontaneity in this tightly wound thriller, supplying his characters with occasional moments of uncertainty prompting the need to Indiana-Jones it (i.e. to make it up as he goes along). We've seen stunts involving cars, motorcycles, helicopters, tall buildings and mountain cliffs before, but not quite like these - innovatively framed, sharply edited and attractively composed scenes. Still, McQuarrie stuffs a great 120-minute action film inside a very good 147-minute one that might have benefited from another run through the editing program.",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2018"," First of all, I need to tell you that I’m not a Tom Cruise hater. I actually like the guy, both onscreen and off. He is by no means the reason for my contrary feelings about the film and my departure from critic colleagues in saying that I found Mission: Impossible—Fallout, unimaginative and, frankly, boring. Perhaps I’ve become spoiled by the Mission: Impossible franchise’s thrilling, death defying opening action scenes, with Cruise invariably leaping onto or off of a plane, or maybe scaling a tall building. Fallout opens with a…simple country wedding scene? Please! That segues into a rather entertaining deception bit, but by then, the dull damage has been done. Oh there are plenty of wild and crazy action sequences to make up for it: endless chases on foot, motorcycle, car, and even helicopter (which I admit, was quite original and breathtaking). But we all know how they’re going to end, don’t we? There are only three choices: Cruise will catch, be caught or get away, and many vehicles will be sacrificed in the process. Okay, I admit, there is some entertainment value in watching for the scene where Cruise actually broke his ankle, but other than that, they’re not that compelling. Even the plot is lackluster. Couldn’t writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (The Mummy, Jack Reacher, Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation) have come up with something a little more original than the tired old stolen plutonium schtick? And I’m sorry, but international terrorists wanting to blow up the world and create anarchy has been done to death. Couldn’t McQuarrie have devised a better, more relatable motive? Republicans and Democrats are constantly accusing each other of wanting to create anarchy, and it’s clear that no one understands what that really means. Add in a stilted, disengaging performance from Henry Cavill (Superman), who plays Cruise’s professional nemesis, and there’s more dull screen time, for which the charm of sidekicks Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames cannot compensate. I swear I didn’t chomp a bad kernel of popcorn, or have a fight with my hubby prior to screening the film. I just didn’t like it. But you and everyone else will probably love it. Go. Enjoy. Your assessment was right on– except I am also bored to death by car chase scenes.  Have seen way too many in my life and don’t want to watch another.     The helicopter chase scene was more fun in Outbreak. As I get older I worry I’m losing my connection to the movies. Thanks for being the only one to remind me I’m not crazy. I don’t know what people are seeing anymore. Im flabergasted by how positively recieved this movie was! Im actually a big fan of cruise and most of the mi franchise. I look up to tom, but it looks like even he was losing faith during the filming.process. ive never before seen him have scenes with questionable acting.but he too was annoyed by the pointless action and overly drawn out scenes. There was no point to any of it. The whole movie was setting us up for the big helicopter finale, but i just couldnt care less about it by the time it arrived. I watches this on a plane really looking forward to it, i actually got.bored and annoyed by the overdone intense soundtrack too. Its a junk food film. A bugatti with a honda civic engine. It was a let down. Thanks for being a voice of reason in what looks like a bribed panel of critics. Cheers. Dear Lisa, Once in a while it’s OK to just enjoy a mindless movie…especially a mindless action flick. It’s also good to enjoy a triple chocolate fudge cake topped with dark chocolate ice cream…it’s not good for you, but it sure tastes good while you eat it.

"Aug 21, 2018"," Together, the Mission: Impossible franchise and Tom Cruise have become a rare commodity in Hollywood: with the former spinning tales of espionage and the latter starring in them, they make a reliable pair. The film series has had its lesser moments. Its leading man has as well, both in the now six-film saga and outside of it. More often than not, however, the combination thrills with a blend of energy, intrigue and spectacle – and an eagerness to thrill. Indeed, don’t discount just what can result when a high-profile actor and the movies he’s led for 22 years not only make a concerted effort to wow their audience, but do so in a way that ensures that viewers know just how much of an effort they’re making. It’s that attitude that revitalised the franchise with 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and, while it mightn’t have been as successful in 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, latest chapter Mission: Impossible – Fallout demonstrates the series and star at close to their finest. The nearest thing to a direct sequel that Mission: Impossible has proffered since it made the leap to the big screen back in 1996, Fallout delves into the aftermath of Rogue Nation – though the titular term spins its web beyond the obvious, and beyond the three nuclear devices that Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise, American Made) is charged with stopping. While the villainous Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, Trespass Against Us) remains in custody, terrorism hasn’t taken a holiday in his absence, with a group called the Apostles intent on dismantling the current world order through death, destruction and devastation. Alas, an early attempt to foil the bombing plot fails when Hunt chooses the life of his right-hand men (with Father Figures’ Ving Rhames making his sixth appearance, and Terminal’s Simon Pegg his fourth) over the job at hand. Consequently, CIA hotshot Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett, Black Panther) overrules IMF head Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin, The Boss Baby) and installs CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill, Justice League) in the team, as they hunt down an insider codenamed John Lark and endeavour to avoid the worst-case scenario.  Writing as well as directing — and returning after doing both on Rogue Nation, too — Christopher McQuarrie weaves the requisite twists, turns, double-crosses, developments that are enjoyably obvious and genuine narrative surprises into the above basic premise, finding room for Rebecca Ferguson’s (The Greatest Showman) Ilsa to appear in her second successive Mission: Impossible movie in the process. The details mightn’t be the main attraction, yet Fallout’s script isn’t merely slick and serviceable, connecting plenty of dots in a smart and rousing style, and earning its moments of depth and introspection as well. The smatterings of humour that have infused franchise’s last two instalments are also evident, and even at its protagonist’s and star’s expenses. When it’s noted that Hunt can’t simply sit idly by and enjoy a normal life because there’ll always be a world to save, the line could apply just as firmly to the man who plays him. Cruise may save the world purely when he’s playing a role and solely in the realm of fiction, but it’s easy to believe that he believes in the importance of his work. For the third time this decade, much ado has been made about his determination to complete his various death-defying stunts himself, and his commitment to practical effects pays off to invigorating effect in Fallout. Rob Hardy’s (Annihilation) cinematography doesn’t need to find angles, framing and lighting techniques that mask CGI – which means that Fallout looks like a true spectacle in each of its many action scenes – and Eddie Hamilton’s (Kingsman: The Golden Circle) editing doesn’t need to hide the corresponding seams either. More than that, the stakes actually feel real when Cruise is hurling himself out of a plane for a HALO jump at 25,000 feet, running and leaping across London rooftops with ankle-breaking verve, and piloting a helicopter through mountainous terrain in a climactic face-off. Cumulatively, and with the clear hard work of the film’s stunt choreography crew, the result is a movie filled with the kind of visual and technical mastery that most features are lucky to display in one scene, let alone in set-piece after set-piece after set-piece, all while conjuring an authentic, edge-of-your seat emotional reaction.  It helps that Fallout’s structure, and the Mission: Impossible series’ lengthy nature, ensure that the film can dive almost straight into the action, requiring little in the way of exposition to establish the scenario or main players. It also helps that McQuarrie has an extensive history with Cruise – and mostly of playing to his strengths – whether helming and scripting Jack Reacher, or writing Valkyrie, Edge of Tomorrow and The Mummy. There’s a wow-first mentality at the heart of both the movie’s love of high-octane antics and McQuarrie’s handling of his leading man; however Fallout is also a character and performance-driven effort in a perhaps surprisingly satisfying manner. Cruise makes Hunt seem flesh-and-blood physically and emotionally, even when he also feels superhuman, in what’s become his career-defining role. Ferguson and Harris demonstrate not just why they were the highlights of Rogue Nation, but why they’re back this time around. Bassett and Cavill make fitting additions, the latter holding his own in brutal fight scenes, amid the bait-and-switch plot, and against the franchise’s megastar. Of course, returning to Cruise as the Mission: Impossible films always do, his commitment to anchoring this series in his all-or-nothing fashion gives Hunt and Fallout the gift of hard-worn zest – and, here, it’s infectious.",POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2018"," Like The NeverEnding Story before it, Mission: Impossible continues to dominate the field of inaccurately named movies. Unlike The NeverEnding Story, Mission: Impossible keeps its high quality consistent into the sixth entry of this summer staple.
 This year’s contribution is Mission: Impossible – Fallout. I am incredibly tempted to make a pun about all of the various vehicles that Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) falls out of, but that would be basic of me. The truth is that gravity is nearly a character itself in this fast-paced action flick that succeeds in keeping the audience on its toes. Picking up just where Rogue Nation left off, Hunt is instantly given his next mission, should he choose to accept it. Categorical bad guy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is finally behind bars, and a new branch of criminal underbelly has emerged in this vacuum. This syndicate, known as The Apostles, have the opportunity to get their mitts on three units of plutonium, and Hunt is just the guy to stop them.  Very quickly, however, something goes wrong. During the nuclear handoff, Hunt is given a single instant to choose between his team and the mission. Being the swell guy that he is, he chooses his team, and the plutonium falls into the wrong hands.  This turns out to be the recurring theme of Fallout. What happens when you need to choose between your team and your mission? The new director of IMF (Alec Baldwin) admires Hunt for his loyalty to the team and ability to adapt a plan while completing the mission. His emotions are a strength. But to the CIA (represented by Angela Bassett), his refusal to follow orders at all cost is a liability, and she nominates a babysitter (Henry Cavill) to keep an eye on Hunt. A little internal tension never hurts in an action film, so with this new team assembled they all head to Paris to get that plutonium back.  Hitting its stride early, Mission: Impossible – Fallout then settles into its rhythm of gliding from one action set-piece to the next. Hunt runs and jumps across rooftops. He gets into shootouts and yells a lot. Name nearly any vehicle, and it’s very likely that he has a chase in it, and crashes it. There is nothing that man cannot do.  Beyond the physical demands of the film, Fallout has Hunt as the grand wizard behind the entire world of the film. He’s always two steps ahead of the bad guys and his own bosses. Watching the movie, and having a sense of ease with this maestro in charge, is a way to add some sense of relaxation between all of the incredible car chases and tense standoffs.  You likely already know how the plot will end, but that’s not the point of Mission: Impossible – Fallout. You watch it for the action and for Tom Cruise, and the movie delivers on both fronts. I caught an IMAX showing last night (full-size screen, but with digital projectors). If IMAX is an option, settle for nothing less. The sound mix is astounding and the “full screen” aspect of the various IMAX scenes (shot on digital IMAX cameras) will blow your mind. The clarity and grandeur makes the sequences – especially the chopper chase – truly breathtaking. Instead of juttering back and forth between “full screen” and “wide screen” aspect ratios, it mostly does the slow transition so it doesn’t catch your eyes. (I only saw it because I was looking for it. My daughter didn’t notice.) My only problem with it is that the majority of it looked like warmed over petrified dog shit. And yes, I saw it in IMAX — full size. In fact, I even saw it a second time in a different IMAX — digital — just to see if there was something wrong with the first presentation. With the exception of the helicopter chase, the movie looks terrible. Drab, muted colors, tons of noise, moments of fuzziness, moments that are really soft-looking, etc. It’s a shame. This film definitely won’t make for a good 4K UHD experience. I think McQuarrie prefers this look. I recently watched all 5 M: Is in 4K, and while it’s certainly the best film in the series, Rogue Nation looked the worst out of all of them. The 4K UHD barely looked any better than the standard blu-ray. It has nothing to do with being shot on film. It’s a stylistic choice that doesn’t necessarily suit the franchise. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but many films that were shot on film have bold, gorgeous, beautiful colors! They are razor sharp! They have zero moments of blurriness/fuzziness. They don’t contain any noise (make no mistake about it, what you see in M: I – Fallout is digital noise, from the DI; it’s NOT film grain). I’m a huge advocate of shooting on film. I’ve driven hundreds of miles, in the past few years to see Nolan and Tarantino films in film projection. McQuarrie apparently doesn’t understand how to use shooting on film to his advantage. It’s interesting that the only segment of M: I 6 that looks great, is the one that he shot digitally (the helicopter chase was shot with IMAX digital cameras). McQuarrie has a slightly gritty style, but I didn’t notice any noise during Fallout. I plan on taking Mrs. Hickman to see it on IMAX some time soon, so I’ll keep my eyes peeled for it.",POSITIVE

"Aug 16, 2018"," “How long before a man like that has had enough?” CIA Agent August Walker asks about Ethan Hunt. Well, we’re going on 22 years and counting, so… a while? The sixth film in the absurdly successful Mission: Impossible franchise – itself based on the television series that originally aired in 1966 – proves that these increasingly extravagant and audacious films, like Ethan Hunt and star Tom Cruise, are virtually indestructible. Not that Hunt (Cruise) himself isn’t showing signs of age: his missions and sacrifices are wearing on him; an old foe, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), perseveres; and his almost suicidal stunts are getting harder to endure. It’s refreshing, making Hunt less superhero and more human, and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie builds on the previous films to give us a real insight into Hunt’s character. This new personal touch adds to the stakes of the action, which is breakneck, relentless and astounding. Tasked with retrieving nuclear material before a terrorist organisation known as the Apostles can use them, Hunt embarks on a globetrotting mission, questioning the loyalty of those around him the whole way. The cinematography is spectacular, the camera majestically soaring over Cruise as he scales dizzyingly high cliff-faces, gliding alongside his speedboat as it winds through an underground river, spinning with him as helicopters are knocked off-course, and beautifully framing landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Tate Modern and the Grand Palais. Every time the action seems almost comically exotic and death-defying, McQuarrie ups the ante, often filming over Cruise’s shoulder so we experience every thrill up close. But there are also philosophical questions here, about our comfort with collateral damage, both on and offscreen. Once you leave the cinema and finally catch your breath, they’re worth some thought. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie.
Starring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin.

Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. La franquicia de “Misión: Imposible” es una de las pocas que va mejorando con cada entrega, en vez tornarse más cansada, más tediosa y menos original, como suele pasar con la mayoría de sagas hollywoodenses. La primera entrega, dirigida por Brian DePalma, es una intrigante  (y a veces confusa) historia de espías; la segunda intentó algo totalmente distinto, y nos entregó una aventura enfocada más en la acción (explosiva, exagerada, llena de palomas) que en la intriga y el suspenso; la segunda secuela manejó un mejor balance entre acción y suspenso, gracias a la dirección del talentoso J.J. Abrams; la cuarta parte es para muchos la mejor, gracias a la espectacularidad de sus secuencias de tensión (¡Tom Cruise es escalando el Burj Khalifa de verdad!) y la quinta repitió el plato, esta vez con un nuevo director. Revisando la saga en general, es claro que las películas de “Misión: Imposible” se han ido alejando de los estereotipos inherentes al género, y han ido desarrollado su propia identidad, enfocándose en dos elementos que la convierten en experiencias verdaderamente emocionantes: el trabajo en equipo (es decir, misiones que tienen que ser cumplidas por Ethan Hunt y sus amigos, y no él solo) y las acrobacias locas que Tom Cruise es capaz de hacer en nombre del realismo, desde escalar el edificio más alto del mundo, hasta colgarse de la puerta de un avión en pleno despegue, y subirse a un helicóptero en vuelo. Por ende, cada vez que se estrena una película de estas, uno va al cine haciéndose dos preguntas: “¿cómo avanzará la historia?” y “¿qué locura hará Tom Cruise esta vez?”. Y afortunadamente, “M:I – Repercusión” cumple con ambos requerimientos, respondiendo ambas preguntas de manera satisfactoria. “M:I – Protocolo Fantasma” (la cuarta entrega dirigida por Brad Bird) sigue siendo la cinta más emocionante, más espectacular y más sólida, pero esta última le sigue muy de cerca. Se trata de una de las películas de acción más tensas que haya visto en mucho tiempo, y así como me da gusto cuando una comedia hace reír o cuando una película de terror me aterra, nada me satisface más que un filme que hace que me muerda las uñas de la tensión. Ayuda también que la franquicia haya adquirido un sabor más parecido al de los filmes de James Bond, pero sin tomarse demasiado en serio a sí misma, y con menos contenido sexista. Aquí, las mujeres no son Chicas Bond (¿o Chicas Hunt?) que solo sirven para satisfacer los deseos sexuales del protagonista. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) es igual o más competente que Hunt, una espía internacional cuya lealtad no siempre está del todo clara. Y Julia (Michelle Monaghan), aunque ahora un poco alejada del mundo tan peligroso al que pertenece su ex pareja, está de vuelta para cerrar aquél hilo narrativo, el cual estuvo en stand by durante las dos entregas anteriores. Esta vez, el MacGuffin (el objeto por el que todo el mundo se comienza a matar) es un maletín con tres esferas de plutonio. La IMF (la Impossible Mission Force; sí, en serio) estuvo a punto de obtenerlo, pero Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) tuvo que decidir entre la misión y su mejor amigo, Luther Stickel (Ving Rhames), y eligió al segundo. Para su jefe, Hunley (Alec Baldwin) tomó la decisión correcta, pero la líder de la CIA, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) no está de acuerdo, por lo que manda a uno de sus mejores hombres, August Walker (Henry Cavill, con el mostacho que tanto problema le causó a “La Liga de la Justicia”) para supervisar la recuperación del plutonio.  Dicha acción obligará a Hunt y a su equipo, el cual también incluye al experto en tecnología, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), a enfrentarse a Walker, y a involucrarse con una “corredora” a la que llaman la Viuda Blanca (Vanessa Kirby), así como con un antagonista de la cinta anterior, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Previsiblemente, la narrativa se desarrollará de tal manera que peligre el destino del mundo. Puede que Jeremy Renner (Brant) no esté de vuelta, pero “Repercusión” definitivamente se siente como una película de “Misión: Imposible”. Disfruté bastante de “Rogue Nation”, la cual fue dirigida y escrita también por el talentoso Christopher McQuarrie, pero “Repercusión” es superior en todo sentido. Las actuaciones son más convincentes, la trama es más interesante y está mejor construida, y las secuencias de acción son infinitamente más tensas, culminando, usualmente, en alguna acrobacia que deja molido a Hunt, o que termina por acabar con alguno de sus contrincantes. Tomemos como ejemplo la pelea mano a mano entre Hunt, Walker y un asesino en el interior de un baño de discoteca. Se trata de uno de los combates más impresionantes de la saga, un enfrentamiento perfectamente coreografiado en el que la edición, el sonido, y los movimientos de los actores son aprovechados al máximo para que uno sienta cada golpe en los huesos. Olvídense de las cámaras en mano o la edición hiperactiva; McQuarrie sabe como filmar su acción, para que sea fácil de comprender, y se vea real. O consideren también la secuencia maratónica en donde vemos a Cruise saltar de techo en techo (así fue como se rompió el tobillo en pleno rodaje), o la escena final donde lo vemos colgado (¡de verdad!) de un helicóptero en vuelo. Si “Misión: Imposible – Repercusión” funciona mejor que cualquier cinta de “Rápidos y Furiosos”, es porque cada acrobacia, cada escena de peligro, es verosímil, se ve como algo que fue filmado en cámara y no creado por imágenes computarizadas. Además, cabe recalcar la manera en que McQuarrie va aumentando gradualmente el suspenso de secuencia en secuencia, poniendo a Hunt y su equipo en situaciones cada vez más peligrosas. Hunt no es un superhéroe invencible; le disparan, le pegan y hasta lo golpean con carros, y sale malherido de todos estos encuentros; es fácil sentir que está en peligro, porque no es perfecto. Pero a la vez, es el protagonista ideal gracias a lo implacable que es, siempre decidido a hacer todo lo que pueda por salvar al mundo. Es parte importante de su caracterización, es parte importante del desarrollo de la trama (adivinen por qué Julia lo dejó…) y es la razón, aparte de lo técnico, por la que la acción lo deja a uno al borde del asiento. Si “Misión: Imposible – Repercusión” no funciona tan bien como “Protocolo Fantasma”, más bien, es porque dos horas y media termina siendo demasiado incluso para una película como esta, en la que las secuencias de violencia son frecuentes, los giros en la trama son casi infinitos, y los personajes son muchos. Una que otra escena (especialmente una persecución en Paris) pudo haber sido acortada, y el clímax de la historia, en las montañas de Cachemira, en la India, aunque emocionante, llega a cansar hacia el final (¿qué tanto pueden caer un par de helicópteros?). “Misión: Imposible – Repercusión” me dejó exhausto, y aunque esto es lo mejor que puede causar una película de acción en su público, creo que también se debe a que se extiende demasiado. Hay mucho que aprender del trabajo de McQuarrie en la franquicia de “Misión: Imposible”: en un filme de acción, la tensión y la verosimilitud son de extrema importancia, pero como en cualquier otra cinta, la historia y los personajes son igual de relevantes. Cruise está igual de carismático que siempre, Pegg y Rhames son hilarantes, Henry Cavill es intimidante como Walker (de Superman no tiene nada) y Lane es de los mejores villanos que ha tenido la franquicia. “Misión: Imposible – Repercusión” es un excelente blockbuster de acción, grandioso, intrigante e increíblemente inquietante, y la máxima prueba de que McQuarrie, Abrams (sigue como productor) y Cruise saben como manejar la franquicia. Si mantienen este nivel de calidad, pueden seguir sacando todas las secuelas que quieran.",POSITIVE

"Aug 13, 2018"," I’m curious if Tom Cruise has in his contracts a clause that says he must run in his films.  In early films like “Taps” and “The Outsiders” he ran with others.  He was constantly running to school in “Risky Business.”  “Legend.”  “The Firm.”  He raced Robert Duval at the end of “Days of Thunder.”  Hell, even though he spends most of the film in a wheelchair, he found time to run in “Born on the Fourth of July.”  But none of these films can prepare you for the mileage he covers in his latest adventure as Ethan Hunt: “Mission: Impossible – FALLOUT.” The film begins with Hunt (Cruise) and his Impossible Mission Force (IMF) attempting to retrieve three pieces of hardware needed to outfit nuclear bombs.  However, when one of his force-mate’s life is put in jeopardy, Ethan chooses them over the success of the mission and the hardware is absconded with.  Cue the music! Not only the best of the “Mission: Impossible” films, “FALLOUT” is also one of the best films of the year.  After an introductory scene that would have made the opening moments of most James Bond films seem tame, Hunt and company are soon introduced to CIA Agent August Walker (Cavill, out of his Superman uniform but just as bad-assed), a no-nonsense kind of guy who certainly would have let a member of his team die and not give it a second thought. There are so many twists and turns here that to go into too much detail about the rest of the film would give away some nice plot points.  Suffice it to say that Cruise easily covers a few miles by way of his fleet feet.  Run, Ethan, run.",POSITIVE

"Aug 10, 2018"," Nos puede caer bien o no Tom Cruise, pero lo que no se puede negar es que ha perfeccionado la fÃ³rmula para hacer una gran pelÃ­cula de acciÃ³n. El ejemplo perfecto es su saga de MisiÃ³n imposible, con la cual ha demostrado que un filme de este gÃ©nero no tiene que ser algo sin valor ni inteligencia. Ahora toca el estreno a MisiÃ³n Imposible: RetribuciÃ³n, la sexta entrega y te decimos quÃ© tal estÃ¡. Ethan Hunt debe afrontar su misiÃ³n mÃ¡s difÃ­cil cuando un error humano le cuesta perder un maletÃ­n de plutonio destinado a hacer bombas atÃ³micas. Con la ayuda de su equipo mÃ¡s fiel, deberÃ¡ detener la muerte del 30% de la poblaciÃ³n humana mientras afronta el pasado que parece perseguirlo. Tenemos que comenzar por esas increÃ­bles secuencias de acciÃ³n. Son pocos los momentos en donde no hay algo en apuesta durante la pelÃ­cula y eso la hace muy dinÃ¡mica. Estos ya son personajes que conocemos y, por eso, su destino involucra mÃ¡s a la audiencia. No sÃ³lo eso, la ejecuciÃ³n es sublime y te encontrarÃ¡s al filo del asiento durante toda la funciÃ³n. Otro de los puntos positivos es la presencia de personajes que ya queremos, incluÃ­dos Luther, Ilsa, Benji y Julia. Es algo que la franquicia aprendiÃ³: estÃ¡ bien tener los mismos personajes en varias pelÃ­culas. Por otro lado, la adiciÃ³n de Henry Cavill es interesante y toma rumbos inesperados durante el filme. El guiÃ³n tambiÃ©n es un elemento a resaltar, ya que sabe utilizar los momentos correctos para profundizar al personaje de Ethan Hunt. No sÃ³lo eso, levanta cuestionamientos morales que es difÃ­cil encontrar en este tipo de pelÃ­culas. En realidad el Ãºnico defecto que tiene el filme es la duraciÃ³n. Aunque en ningÃºn momento se siente aburrida, sÃ­ es mucho tiempo para pasar en la sala de cine. Ahora ya lo sabe, la saga de Ethan Hunt sigue teniendo un impacto positivo. La pasarÃ¡n bien y se divertirÃ¡n viendo a Tom Cruise hacer sus propios stunts.",POSITIVE
"Aug 10, 2018"," In 1996, auteur Brian De Palma and superstar Tom Cruise teemed to deliver a franchise-birthing action movie that seems even more ripe, strange, bold and unlikely twenty-two years on. Featuring a screenplay from powerhouses Robert Towne - yes, Chinatown’s Towne - and David Koepp, Mission: Impossible, based on the 1966-1973 TV series, featured idiosyncratic, at times excellent, dialogue; Bond-like Europe-trotting; and superb set-pieces. It was also unmistakably a Brian De Palma joint, featuring many of his themes and obsessions and jam-packed, as is his wont, with cinematic references; indeed, the film’s classic set-piece, the “Langley heist”, was a direct homage to a similar scene in Jules Dassin’s 1954 French heist thriller Rififi. Perhaps it was precisely because the film was such a ‘director’s piece’ that Cruise decided to embark, for the next four instalments, on a bold and admirable experiment. He hired different directors for each, and told them not to make their franchise entries in the style of the first film, but to actively depart from it, to make their episodes in their own styles. This flew radically against the entire history of sequels and franchises; continuity had always ruled in television and film series, so that Irvin Kershner’s Empire Strikes Back felt like George Lucas’ Star Wars and Sylvester Stallone’s Rocky II felt like John G. Avildsen’s Rocky. John Woo’s Mission: Impossible 2 (2000) felt nothing like a Brian De Palma film nor a J.J. Abrams film; he contributed Mission: Impossible 3 in 2006. The Incredibles director Brad Bird’s 2011 entry dropped the numerical tally in the title - it was called Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol, and then in 2015 Christopher McQuarrie, best known and admired for writing The Usual Suspects, kind of re-booted the franchise with Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation. It was the best entry since De Palma’s original, primarily because it introduced a female character, Ilsa Faust, played impeccably by Rebecca Ferguson, who was a rich, intriguing character, vital to the plot and, increasingly, to Cruise’s character Ethan Hunt. The series had always featured high-stakes stunts, but with Faust, we finally got stakes of the heart. The series had a human scale again, and felt fresh. McQuarrie’s success with Rogue Nation has caused Cruise to break his own rule; he gave McQuarrie another go, and the result is Fallout, which continues to utilize Faust - and why wouldn’t you? - as well as its villain, Solomon Lane, played by gaunt, evil-eyed Brit Sean Harris. We’re still stuck with Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, a kind of Statler and Waldorf at this point, along with Alec Baldwin, and there are two major new characters of note, played by Henry Cavill and Vanessa Kirby. They’re both almost supernaturally attractive, and each delivers a one-note, almost comically bad performance; next to Ferguson and Harris, they feel like amateurs, or, worse, models given lines to say. It’s a shame, too, because it is the jovial ensemble of these films that is their primary distinction; that, and great action. And this film has great action. The final act, in particular, is mind-blowing. I long ago gave up letting action sequences make me tense, so why was I clutching my armrest? McQuarrie’s massive tornadoes of bodies, steel and space are visceral, energetic, exhilarating, and at least give the very convincing impression of being entirely ‘practical’ - that is, utilizing stunt work and props rather than digital effects. (Of course, the sequences use both techniques, but the digital effects are so well hidden as to be generally undetectable). As an action movie, it is remarkable, up there with the very best. As a spy movie, it’s lightweight, but very, very fun, and the established ensemble, Ferguson, Baldwin and Harris included, are comfy to be around. Indeed, it’s strange, to me, what a warm and fuzzy feeling this franchise - or at least these last two installments of it - gives me. The humor, delivered entirely by Pegg and Rhames, doesn’t work, but it doesn’t seem to matter; the very fact these two not-very-fit-looking aging codgers are at least trying to crack wise is enough. And they’ve got Cruise, fit as ever (though very puffy of face - Botox?), to gee them up. He isn’t the centre of the vortex, he is the vortex, but he’s generous with screentime, lines and energy. He doesn’t need to prove that he’s the star, because he is is so the star. Rogue Nation’s strongest asset - Ferguson - doesn’t get enough to do; the complexity of Faust’s relationship with Cruise’s Hunt is jettisoned for a similarly complicated one between Hunt and Cavill’s August Walker, which is hindered by Cavill’s unroadworthy performance. Thus that spark of magic - an old-fashioned European untrustworthy romance, in the fine tradition of Casablanca - isn’t present. But action is, and this movie, more than any in the series, maybe more than any in history, is all action. And, like Hunt, like Cruise, it is very good at the single thing it does best. Last year Greta Gerwig’s Lady Bird concluded with the lead character offering her mother two of the most basic, important and simple words we have as a species. The film was known to be semi-autobiographical, and, despite its immense value as easily accessible entertainment, those final words revealed it to be, essentially, incredibly direct. It was the movie equivalent of a personal message from one person to another via social media: simultaneously intimate and completely public. Now, Carla Simón’s Summer 1993 does a similar thing, but this time the story, characters and scenes are acknowledged to be not just ‘semi’ but directly autobiographical, and, therefore, the film lacks Lady Bird’s advantage of dramatic license. The events of Summer 93 are interesting and affecting, but they can’t possibly be as meaningful to anyone as they must be to Simón, nor the stakes as high. Gerwig’s film achieved some general appeal, but Simón’s is inherently specific. In the summer of 1993, following the death of her parents, Simón went to live in the Catalonian countryside with her uncle, his wife, and their daughter, and not for the short term. It was obviously a summer that changed everything for Simón, an elongated reckoning with a cataclysmic event, and her film’s greatest ambition and, to a fair extent, achievement is portraying the unique and fascinating way a six year old deals with grief, loss and change. She has to recall how her young brain processed such heavy materials, interpret it, and present it in a way that we - adults, assumedly - can relate. It’s a tough (self-)assignment, and Simón doesn’t make it any easier on herself by restricting her shooting style to the basic elements of script, cast and location. She barely uses music and completely eschews any flourishes of camera or post-production, limiting herself to handheld coverage of her actors’ naturalistic performances. Luckily, her entire small ensemble are exceptional and, vitally for a film like this, feel completely real. Of course, the whole enterprise rests entirely on Simón’s star, and avatar, Laia Artigas; she’s the director’s only special effect. She’s excellent, but in relying on her so strongly - much of the film is spent in close-up on her small face - Simón perhaps expects too much. There’s only so much interior pain, confusion, suffering and acceptance a little girl can show. This is a slow, quiet film of gentle revelation. It is unutterably sad throughout, and it concludes movingly. You’ll need to be in the right mood for it, and it’s probably best approached as cinema to be appreciated rather than a story to be enjoyed. Come to see the debut feature of a promising filmmaker, armed with patience, a sense of discovery, and, if possible, your own inner child.",POSITIVE
"Aug 9, 2018"," I don’t normally review movies like this, but on the Bladder Scale™, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is pretty punishing, because there is never a moment in the film where you can take a break to go. From frame one, this movie moves at a breakneck pace, but it also knows when to stop and collect itself and give us the bits of character and plot that we need. Then it’s off to the races again, all over the map – Belfast, London, Paris, Kashmir, a few other places.  The action is unrelenting, giving us terrific sequences on a level and scale that we haven’t seen in years. There are a lot of comparisons to Mad Max: Fury Road in quality, and not to sound hyperbolic, but there are moments here that recall great Spielberg action at its best. There is a chase sequence here that seems to last forever (in a good way) that rivals the intensity and excitement of the Truck Chase in Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s an all-timer, and that isn’t even the biggest set piece of the film. This movie is a juggernaut. Is it the best of the series? Time will tell on that  I’m still thinking it over, but I feel like it might be. Right now I’m flipping between this and Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, but what Ghost Protocol has going against it is that its best sequence is right in the middle of the film, and Fallout continues to top itself until its insane finale. The film also has the advantage of giving us, at last, some exploration and depth into the character of Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). Before I get people all riled up, I’ve never really felt that Ethan Hunt was all that great of a character. We rarely see him in stillness. We rarely get an impression of his motivations or what makes him tick. Mission: Impossible 3 addresses this somewhat, but that film may be the weakest one in the series (I have a soft spot for Mission: Impossible 2, which is directed by John Woo like he’s being chased himself, and while the movie is spectacularly dumb, it’s dumb in that Fast and Furious way that makes it enjoyable). Mission: Impossible – Fallout manages to build character while never really stopping except in key moments of exposition. We finally get a look at who Ethan Hunt is under the hood, and it’s long overdue. Tom Cruise leaves it all on film in this movie. He holds nothing back, and by the end of the movie, we’re as exhausted as he seems to be. Doing almost all of his own stunts, Cruise can’t fake the fear and determination in his face as he hangs from the bottom of a helicopter, or jumps from building to building, or commits himself to every physical exertion he can. And yet, we get a sense of what drives Ethan Hunt a little bit, beginning early on when Hunt makes a choice and his choice causes serious problems with world events. The Syndicate still exists, even though leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has been captured, and Hunt, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) are tasked to retrieve nuclear material that could be used by the Syndicate’s splinter group, The Apostles, to wreak devastation on the world. But Hunt and his team lose the material, which causes head of the CIA Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), over the protests of head of the Impossible Mission Force Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), to bring in the big guns in the form of her agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to help secure the plutonium.  Also in play is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), tasked with MI6 with her own mission. Of course, this is a Mission: Impossible movie, which means nothing is as it seems, and no one’s loyalties are clear. Christopher McQuarrie is the first director in this franchise to return, and for those going in, this is a direct sequel to the evens of Rogue Nation. While you don’t have to revisit all of the films in the series to get a bead on this one, there are quite a few callbacks to the previous films (even 2!). If you’re going to revisit any of them, you should watch Rogue Nation beforehand. As an action director, McQuarrie has never been better, and he was already a hell of a writer before this, if you’re at all familiar with the genuine classics in his roster. The craftwork behind Fallout is first-rate, with brilliant cinematography by Rob Hardy and editing by Eddie Hamilton.  The stunt teams involved should get an honorary Oscar on their own (and why we don’t have stunt work Oscars is beyond me, but I’m sure this film would win hands down). All the supporting work is outstanding – Simon Pegg’s Benji may not be the most skilled field agent, but he has a lot of heart. So does Ving Rhames, and there is a wonderful moment where Rhames is surprisingly emotional as he describes his loyalty to his friend Ethan. We also get Rebecca Ferguson returning, and the filmmakers were very wise to bring her back. She was a terrific character in the fifth filme, and she’s just as extraordinary here. Alec Baldwin, Angela Bassett, and Sean Harris play their roles nicely, and I really love the emotion that Baldwin brings to it this time. And then there is Henry Cavill, who feels like the first character in this franchise that gives Ethan Hunt serious competition in capability. Hunt may be older and a little wiser, but physically, Walker has it all over him, which makes for some very intense moments. Watching Cruise and Cavill together is a real treat, and they were wise to cast him. But for me, this series lives and breathes with Ethan Hunt, and I am happy to say that to me we finally get an Ethan Hunt that is truly compelling. I enjoy the Mission: Impossible films, but my chief complaint has always been that Hunt has always been a character that things happen to, rather than one that makes choices. Hunt makes choices here, and those choices are motivated by real emotion, fear, and drive. This makes Ethan Hunt much more heroic this time out – he’s fighting for a purpose, and his love and loyalty to his team and others is paramount to the mission, and that gives him an edge that Cruise makes us feel. I also love that Cruise, perhaps for the first time, lets us know that he’s feeling his age a little bit – his exasperated looks to his team as they happily send him off on another chase are priceless, and during the film’s breathtaking climax, Cruise gives us an Ethan Hunt that may, at last, have reached his physical limits. Indestructible action heroes don’t make for riveting cinema, and Cruise never plays him that way. Yes, Fallout is a bit long, but there isn’t a wasted moment in it, and I certainly couldn’t say how you can lose anything without losing the pace or the intensity. So you may want to rethink that large soda, because once you strap in to Mission: Impossible – Fallout, you’re in for the whole shebang.  This is why we go to summer movies – to be thrilled, moved, and awed. Dollar for dollar, pound for pound, this is the best entertainment of the summer, and I’m hard pressed to think how any sequels will be able to top it. I’m very excited to see them try.",POSITIVE

Tiene el carisma de Sean Connery, la tecnologÃ­a de Roger Moore y la fuerza y habilidad fÃ­sica de Daniel Craig. El personaje interpretado por Tom Cruise desde 1996 estÃ¡ en su mejor momento y esta saga ha alcanzado una cÃºspide insÃ³lita con su sexta pelÃ­cula: âMisiÃ³n: Imposible â RepercusiÃ³nâ (âMission: Impossible â Falloutâ). A tal punto que me atrevo no sÃ³lo a compararlo con el Agente 007, sino a decir que, por este camino, la franquicia bien podrÃ­a convertirse en una saga similar a aquella basada en el personaje de Ian Fleming. Tal vez estoy exagerando, pero todo en la saga de âMisiÃ³n: Imposibleâ es una exageraciÃ³n tras otra, de eso se trata, de impresionar cada vez mÃ¡s y lo han logrado. Si bien la calidad de sus cintas no es necesariamente en orden ascendente, sÃ­ brindan un trabajo consistente, sÃ³lido y preciso, haciendo de su mÃ¡s reciente aventura el mejor filme de acciÃ³n del aÃ±o. Muy directamente relacionada con su entrega anterior (âRogue Nationâ, 2015), en esta ocasiÃ³n Hunt (Cruise) y compaÃ±Ã­a, deberÃ¡n recuperar tres esferas de plutonio, con los que una organizaciÃ³n llamada Los ApÃ³stoles, formada por los exagentes convertidos en terroristas que integraban El Sindicato, pretenden crear devastadoras armas nucleares. Esto involucrara al encarcelado Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) y la misteriosa figura sin rostro de un tal John Lark, el aparente lÃ­der radical de Los ApÃ³stoles. La CIA, ademÃ¡s, desconfiando de la IMF, vigila sus acciones muy de cerca por medio de August Walker (Henry Cavill), un hombre que cumple con misiones imposibles a base de mucha mÃ¡s violencia y muertes. Entre conspiraciones, engaÃ±os y toda clase de secuencias de acciÃ³n de las que parece imposible salir ileso, Hunt y compaÃ±Ã­a deberÃ¡n evitar que muera gran parte de la humanidad con la misma combinaciÃ³n de trabajo, precisiÃ³n y mucha suerte que han aplicado por cinco filmes. Â¿CÃ³mo saldrÃ¡ de esta el buen Cruise? Â¿EscalarÃ¡ el edificio mÃ¡s alto del mundo? Â¿Se colgarÃ¡ de un aviÃ³n en pleno vuelo? No hay nada que no sea capaz de hacer este casi sÃºperhombre. Y digo Cruise y no Hunt, porque es bien sabido que el actor hace sus propias escenas de acciÃ³n, sin emplear dobles de riesgo. Es Ã©l mismo quien estÃ¡ frente a nosotros en todo momento. Un compromiso increÃ­ble en tiempos donde los efectos por computadora son el comÃºn. Esto destaca las pelÃ­culas de âMisiÃ³n: Imposibleâ mÃ¡s allÃ¡ y brinda una clara diferencia con otras sagas de acciÃ³n. Hay un cierto grado de realidad, crudeza y visceralidad que se les imprime. MÃ¡s claramente desde âGhost Protocolâ (2011), la idea de estas aventuras es poner al protagonista en situaciones cada vez mÃ¡s peligrosas o visualmente asombrosas. Pero que se sientan, no nada mÃ¡s es un espectÃ¡culo visual, sino poner al pÃºblico ahÃ­ mismo.  âRepercusiÃ³nâ lo consigue. Desde una pelea cuerpo a cuerpo en un baÃ±o hasta una persecuciÃ³n en helicÃ³pteros, no pierde jamÃ¡s nuestra atenciÃ³n y logra sorprendernos cada vez. Es la magia fÃ­lmica, una combinaciÃ³n de coreografÃ­a, trabajo de cÃ¡mara, ediciÃ³n y quizÃ¡ un mÃ­nimo de efectos por computadora. Por otro lado, no sÃ© bien si podrÃ­a diferenciar quÃ© fue creado de forma digital y quÃ© es real. SÃ© que muchas cosas son reales porque asÃ­ lo dicen, pero la tecnologÃ­a ha avanzado tanto que no sÃ© bien si mis ojos noten la diferencia a tal grado. MÃ¡s bien creo que el gran mÃ©rito es el ritmo y la direcciÃ³n. Un saber quÃ©, cÃ³mo y cuÃ¡ndo mostrar las cosas. CuÃ¡ndo motocicletas, cuÃ¡ndo puÃ±os y patadas, en quÃ© punto exacto de toda la trama poner cada cosa. Es una arquitectura difÃ­cil, pero concisa y exacta, que mantiene el ritmo cardiaco del espectador acelerado cuando debe y relajado para que tome un poco de aire. El resultado es mucho mÃ¡s efectivo que âRogue Nationâ, tambiÃ©n dirigida por Christopher McQuerrie, siendo la primera vez que dos filmes de âMisiÃ³n: Imposibleâ son realizados por un mismo director. Que, por cierto, McQuerrie y Cruise trabajaron juntos en la acciÃ³n por primera vez en âJack Reacherâ (2012). Son una gran combinaciÃ³n para el gÃ©nero y esa es la gran cualidad de âRepercusiÃ³nâ. PodrÃ­amos pensar, entonces, que su debilidad es la historia. Es genÃ©rica, lineal, hay un villano y un hÃ©roe y listo. PodrÃ­a ser, pero creo que su punto mÃ¡s dÃ©bil es que depende mucho de las otras pelÃ­culas, sobre todo de la anterior, para entenderla. Por otro lado, sobrelleva muy bien todo, volviÃ©ndolo tan claro que casi no necesitamos recordar quiÃ©n es quiÃ©n, por ejemplo, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), âel gran amorâ de Hunt, a quien no veÃ­amos desde una muy breve apariciÃ³n en âGhost Protocolâ. Si bien es un obstÃ¡culo, McQuerrie lo sortea tan bien como si formara parte de la IMF. âRepercusiÃ³nâ nos hace ver que esta saga no es ningÃºn juego. Y con todas las conspiraciones, gadgets absurdos y otras exageraciones, y hasta una organizaciÃ³n criminal para vencer, creo que tiene todos los elementos para sustituir a James Bond, en caso de que aquellos filmes, que actualmente suman 24 entregas, algÃºn dÃ­a decaigan. Se entregarÃ­a la antorcha de relevo, como cuando cambian de actor. QuiÃ©n sabe, tal vez en un futuro veremos a otro intÃ©rprete haciendo una nueva versiÃ³n de Ethan Hunt. Porque a diferencia de otras sagas de acciÃ³n vigentes, âMisiÃ³n: Imposibleâ se toma las cosas con seriedad y pone empeÃ±o en casi todos los aspectos. AsÃ­ lo demuestra su mÃ¡s nueva pelÃ­cula y si bien es imposible mantener las expectativas en un lugar tan alto por siempre, lo que tenemos aquÃ­ es un fabuloso logro fÃ­lmico del gÃ©nero.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2018"," Mission: Impossible –  Fallout  opens grungy, with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) sleeping rough in a safehouse, suffering apocalyptic dreams of his wedding, interrupted by a mushroom cloud. From the start,  Fallout  picks Hunt apart, trying to peer inside a character resistant to examination after five movies of mythic labors. James Bond has gone through this introspective impulse before, most recently with Daniel Craig's 007, who exposed the superspy's tuxedoed sophistication as a thin veneer covering a wrecking ball. But where the Bond series has gotten down in the muck, exposing the brutality of its protagonist's methods—MI6 not so much assigning him, as letting him off a leash—Mission: Impossible  has taken the opposite approach, deifying Hunt as mankind's unbreakable savior. At several points,  Fallout presents dark possibilities, alternate scenarios for the consequences of failure. How (not if) Hunt defies fate and rewrites, with sheer will, the world's future, becomes the primary narrative tension—the question not so much whether or not Hunt will triumph, but just how high a scenario can be stacked against him. The plot is flimsy—we're chasing nukes again—but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, returned from  Rogue Nation  (PSA: unlike the rest of the series,  Fallout  is in close-continuity with the previous entry), is by now expert at knotting new complications into straightforward plot points. He stacks body doubles, mask twists, assassination attempts and goons, then resolves them all in the next spectacular action sequence. Fallout  has several signature action stunts, including a HALO jump over Paris and bone-breaking jumps, all helpfully included in the opening credits so you know what you're getting. But it's a fight in a well-lit bathroom that most had me clenching my hands like angry Arthur. Pitting Hunt and a partner against one man, the fight is body-slamming, tile-destroying carnage, with a choreographic intensity rarely seen outside of  The Raid  movies. The action throughout is of a similar caliber.  Mission: Impossible – Fallout  is an unrelentingly consistent action movie, with not a single sequence wasted before the next big stunt. Fallout  may not have a sequence to match Hunt's Burj Khalifa climb in  Ghost Protocol—Cruise kicking off the face of the world's tallest skyscraper into an escape trajectory arc is the signature stunt of this decade at least—but it has substantial advantages over the fourth  Mission: Impossible (often  declared the series' best), most notably its abundance of worthy opponents, including the return of  Rogue Nation's  The Syndicate leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), now sporting a frazzled detainee beard. But more than villains,  Fallout  throws up human obstacles, including kill-first-questions-later CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), still trying to work her way back into the good graces of MI6 after the events of  Rogue Nation, and Sloan's right-hand assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill). Fallout  is downright labyrinthine in its shifting loyalties, with only Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) providing an unswerving core. Even Hunt is called into question, though  Fallout  treats it more like a fun counterfactual than daring to try and trick us. In one satisfying aside, we get a glimpse of a Hunt who's thrown away his moral code and rampages freely. Sometimes  Fallout  can get more confusing than it actually is, especially when it indulges in a taste of the Shakespearean dramas playing out within the household of White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), an enigmatic philanthropist at the center of every deal. But more often, because Hunt is an unstoppable, smiling battering ram, human nuance is outsourced to secondary characters to excellent effect. For much of the movie, Faust exists to disrupt Hunt's plans—even if they seem to share some of the same objectives—popping up at inopportune moments, perhaps with a submachine gun. New character Walker becomes a more immediate foil, his pretty-boy mustache barely covering a brutalizing efficiency. Cavill and Bassett combine to become the perfect embodiment of the CIA, portrayed in  Fallout  as an organization at-odds with IMF and a parody of realpolitik prone to moral compromise, if not outright subversion, in the name of a compromised pragmatism—spywork adrift of Hunt's holy mission. After six entries,  Mission: Impossible  has certainly earned a little introspection, even when Hunt giving up a normal life to save humanity takes on an almost messianic aspect, largely because  Fallout  is open in its ambition. The interplay between Cruise, an actor who will do anything to entertain, and Hunt, who will do anything to save the world, is mingled cannily; the conflation of Hunt and Cruise performed to the extent that it improves the verisimilitude of the stunts, particularly in a climactic helicopter chase with Cruise at the stick. Mission: Impossible –  Fallout  can feel a little more complexity-flavored than nuanced, but there's no questioning its effectiveness as an action movie. Unlike the characterful, family reunion feel of the  Fast and Furious  movies, with their shaggy dog adventures,  Mission: Impossible  is as laser focused as an action movie can get. ""Your mission, should you choose to accept it. I wonder… did you ever choose not to?"" Lane asks. He isn't the only character to prod Hunt with the IMF assignment boilerplate, looking for some motivation behind a man who literally throws himself off buildings to get the job done. But how do you crack the interior life of a character who averts plagues and nuclear wars, whose existence is the single pivot point of world events, over and over? Hunt gives one possible answer early in the movie, when Benji, shaking with nervous energy before a clandestine meeting, asks Hunt if he gets scared. Hunt doesn't answer, just smiles. His indifference would be sociopathic if we didn't know better: Hunt is a human-scale cipher not because there are hidden depths, but because he is wholly defined by action, a figment of IMAX psychology.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018"," The Mission: Impossible franchise has continued, with the same actor in the lead role, more than three times longer than the seven-year run of the Mission: Impossible TV show. The first film in the series came out the week after I graduated from high school, in 1996. I turned 40 the week I saw the new one. The sixth film, Mission: Impossible—Fallout, stars the 56-year-old Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt, the American secret agent who has spent nearly a quarter century engaging in globetrotting intrigue, most of it involving elaborate, impressive stunts. Cruise doesn’t show his age in the slightest, and never seems out of place engaging in fights with men much younger (and taller) than himself, whether they’re hanging from a helicopter, jumping out of a plane or engaging in fisticuffs in a men’s bathroom. While the first five Mission: Impossible films all had different directors, Fallout features a repeater for the first time, with Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed Cruise is the first Jack Reacher movie, the one that was good) returning as writer and director. Fallout feels more like a direct sequel to 2011’s Rogue Nation, directly continuing the plot of that movie and even bringing back one of its main villains, Sean Harris’ Solomon Lane. The plot concerns the efforts of Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his team (now down to just Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) to stop the efforts of a mysterious, nihilistic terrorist, who has written an apocalyptic, Steve Bannon-like manifesto about the necessity of massive destruction. Solomon Lane still figures in the plot as a prisoner who’s a pawn among various governments, while Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett return as rival bureaucrats. The key new edition is Henry Cavill, as an agent at loggerheads with Cruise, and not only does he show more personality than he ever got to as Superman, but we finally see his mustache that was edited out of last year’s Justice League. Also still around is Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the spy who was the breakout of the 2011 film. Fallout’s one huge strength is that the action is consistently riveting. The film leapfrogs from Belfast to Paris to London to the mountains of Kashmir, and throughout we get about seven different major action set pieces, the best of which is a two-part, multi-faceted chase scene through Paris. Other highlights include a well-executed fight in a bathroom, and the final sequence involving a pair of helicopters. The action is all clear and tightly shot, and if you’re fan of Cruise’s climb up that Dubai skyscraper in the best film of the series, Brad Bird’s 2011 Ghost Protocol, you’re in luck—there are a lot more scenes of Cruise climbing. And, as usual with Cruise, he does a lot of running. The film’s also creative with a few well-worn conceits. Everyone’s tired of action movies, especially the ones involving disasters, using CNN footage to commentate on the action. This one has the best subversion of that ever, including a dynamite cameo by Wolf Blitzer. And while the trope of good guys cutting wires on a bomb while a digital clock counts down how much time is left until it blows up has been in about 500 movies before, Fallout changes it up in a couple of ways, including making one of the clocks analog. However, the film’s weak link is one that it shares with Brian De Palma’s original Mission: Impossible from 1996: the plot is convoluted, with betrayal upon betrayal and plot twist upon plot twist, to the point where it’s difficult for anything to have stakes when they keep changing every 10 minutes. The action is impressive enough to mostly keep this problem at bay, and the third act is relatively straightforward and still pretty thrilling. How long can these movies continue? You have to think the series will eventually go the way of James Bond and put another actor in the Ethan Hunt role, or possibly go back to the premise of the original series and make it about a team. But despite the age of the premise—and its leading man—Mission: Impossible remains the best action franchise going.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018"," The artifice on which the “Mission Impossible” movies are based is the wearing of the latex masks. Scan someone’s face—bang—a hyper-realistic mask with perfect hair follicles materializes. Slap a Band-Aid tech thingy over your vocal chords—Shazam!—you sound exactly like whomever the Band-Aid translates your voice to sound like. If you can live with this nonsense (and we all can and do), “Mission” movies provide endless amounts of foolish fun, because the masks are the hair and makeup equivalent of the double-reverse play in football: many fake-out possibilities. Put that together with Energizer-Bunny Tom Cruise, who enjoys doing insane stunts to keep life interesting (outside of his Scientology responsibilities), and you’ve got quite a satisfying summer blockbuster. You must know by now how these things kick off, with Ethan Hunt (Cruise) being presented with the most impossible mission, ever, should he choose to accept it. I’m still waiting for the tape-recorded message that says: “You will be given a bleeding leg wound and must then swim 200 miles in shark-infested waters to an island where you will free-solo climb a vertical, 3-mile high, live volcano and then BASE-jump into it. That’s your mission, should you choose to accept it.” And Hunt says, “I’m not doing that.” Ethan and crew get after that plutonium and follow it to France, where they enlist the help of the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a black market arms broker. Her clients have the plutonium. At this time, CIA higher-up (Angela Bassett) assigns agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) to shadow Hunt and see that he does his job. If he doesn’t, shoot him. Why? She doesn’t trust Hunt. Enter Hunt’s flame from the last movie (with whom he had remarkable chemistry, it must be said) is ex-British MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). She wants the nuke balls too. Late in the game, Hunt crosses paths with his ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan) and her new husband (Wes Bentley), when the team arrives in Kashmir. Operatives like Hunt are better off not married, and so he had cut her loose to have a nice life with a doctor husband, but he finds that his heart still aches a little bit for her, even though it aches quite a bit for Miss MI6, too. They have more in common, after all. It’s a bit sad. Still, these are first-world problems. Hunt could choose to, say, be a farmer and go sky-diving on the weekends to get his adrenaline fix. Keep his woman happier. That said, if you want action, you’ve come to the right place: There are scrabbling, no-rope cliff climbs; fights galore (the best of these is a bathroom brawl utilizing a curvy section of sink pipe); oxygenated HALO jumps (high-altitude, low-opening parachuting); jet-setting to London, Paris, and Kashmir; kidnapping; jumping out of a very, very high window onto concrete; climbing up a rope to an already flying chopper, falling back down, and very, very stubbornly climbing back up again, while being shot at. And of course, Cruise’s favorite thing—fast alley-way and stair-step motorcycling. The only other problem here is that this MI is getting slightly too predictable in that Cruise is the Teflon agent who gets a bit banged up but is never in any danger of dying. The series needs to get that tension and unpredictability back in there. But, Tom Cruise has definitely cornered the market on a stunt-driven franchise where he gets to do exactly what he loves, spending his time mastering things like helicopter flying, motorcycling, and other type-A adrenaline junkie things. All well and good. But stunts are a young man’s game and he’s 56 already. He needs to sleep more between movies.",POSITIVE

"Aug 6, 2018"," Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible—Fallout is a great, unapologetic nose-dive into old-school, free-fall, red-meat action that plays as a stark reminder of why physical presence and real stunts still have the cinematic upper hand over CGI and green screens, no matter how technologically sophisticated and convincing. Helicopters play chicken through tight mountain passes in Kashmir, motorcycles careen through the streets of Paris, and star Tom Cruise hurls himself from a plane 25,000 feet in the air. The movie leaps nimbly and confidently from one massive action setpiece to the next, and each one has its own unique pleasures and tensions that build on the previous; the impossible is always made possible and always just within the realm of the believable, even as you watch in disbelief.  The joy of the Mission: Impossible franchise—which has now entered its third decade and, against all odds, keeps getting better—has always been its gall, its unwavering confidence in setting before us the utterly absurd and getting us to buy right in time and time again (the rubber masks that are often used to disguise a character’s identity being the definitive example). It is perhaps the highest praise I can give the film that one of the best sequences involves nothing more than Tom Cruise running across the rooftops of London—leaping from roof to roof, cutting across narrow ledges, leaping out of windows when necessary—in desperate pursuit of a villain who isn’t even aware that he’s running after him. The sequence works not because of aesthetic verve, but because Cruise and McQuarrie invest it with such absolute conviction. You can literally feel Cruise giving it his all—physically, emotionally—as he sprints across the frame, leaving everything on the screen. We are now six films deep into the franchise, although the first two films, Brian De Palma’s Mission: Impossible (1996) and John Woo’s Mission: Impossible II (2000), now feel like experiments in a different franchise altogether, one in which each entry would be distinctly different from the previous. Starting with J.J. Abrams’s Mission: Impossible III (2006), the series moved in a different direction, launching a long-running narrative arc and set of returning characters that more clearly bound the successive films together. While Abrams has stayed on as a producer, he handed the directorial reigns first to Brad Bird for 2011’s Ghost Protocol and then to McQuarrie for 2015’s Rogue Nation, whose storyline funnels right into Fallout, bringing back several characters introduced in that film, including the nefarious villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), whose years of imprisonment have transformed him from slick and clean-shaven to wild-eyed and bearded, which gives his involvement with a plot hatched to detonate three nuclear weapons at major sites around the world a crusading religious vibe.  Once again standing in his way is Ethan Hunt (Cruise), the aging star of the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) who, while never explicitly articulating it, has clearly grown world-weary, but without losing his moral conviction and commitment to the greater good, which is what keeps him accepting all those impossible missions. The assignment that kicks off Fallout involves Hunt and his IMF colleagues Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) getting ahold of three atomic cores to keep them away from an apocalyptic group known as The Apostles. They mission goes south and they lose the cores mainly because Hunt can’t stand to lose one of his team, which doesn’t sit well with Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), the head of the IMF. It sits even worse with CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), who comes to distrust Hunt enough that she saddles him with one of her own, a tall, steely, musachioed agent named August Walker (Henry Cavill) who does not share Hunt’s distaste for direct violence.  After that, the movie is off and running around the world, with Hunt and Walker skydiving onto the glass roof of the Grand Palais in Paris and facing down a ruthless arms dealer (Liang Yang) in what has to be the world’s brightest, cleanest, whitest, most deserted men’s room. The location provides great backdrop for a vicious three-way brawl that is finally ended by Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the is-she-or-isn’t-she? double-triple-quadruple British spy who first caught Hunt’s eye in Rogue Nation. The romantic chemistry isn’t explicit, but it’s palpable, which makes it all the more difficult that Hunt and Ilsa have competing assignments that they are both willing to pursue with everything they have.  The story, written by McQuarrie, twists and turns all around, with Hunt at one point being framed as the villain before the true baddie emerges. It is punctuated throughout with action sequences that rely heavily on real stunts, real locations, and the convincing illusion that the stars are really in danger. McQuarrie has no qualms about borrowing from the greats, and old-schoolers will immediately recognize the debt owed to The French Connection (1971) in a Paris car chase and the majority of the ’70s James Bond films everywhere else. But, it works because McQuarrie sells it with little fuss and a whole lot of guts; he transforms the familiar and the formulaic into something truly pulse-pounding, especially the grand climax that finds Luther and Benji trying to disarm two nuclear weapons while Hunt pursues the villain (and a crucial key he holds) in a mountainous helicopter chase that culminates in mano-a-mano fisticuffs at the edge of, and then over the edge of, a sheer cliff. The fact that all of this supposedly transpires during a 15-minute countdown is utterly ridiculous, but it works in racheting up the tension so high and leaving you so exhausted that you’re torn between wanting an eighth installment and hoping they end it all here, at this amazing high point. It never hurts to go out on top. Given that the film runs nearly two and a half hours, all of the supplements save the three audio commentaries have been gathered on a separate Blu-ray to maximize bitrate. The audio commentaries give us writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and actor Tom Cruise on one track, McQuarrie and editor Eddie Hamilton on another, and composer Lorne Balfe on a third. We also get an isolated Dolby Digital 5.1-channel track for Balfe’s score. The extras Blu-ray opens with “Behind the Fallout,” a 53-minute, seven-part look at the film’s production that is, not surprisingly, heavy on analyzing all that went into the stuntwork: “Light the Fuse” (11 min.) gives us a general overview; “Top of the World” (11 min.) focuses on the extraordinary HALO jump sequence; “The Big Swing: Deleted Scene Breakdown” (4 min.) looks at the Paris car chase sequence; “The Fall” (6 min.) focuses on Cruise hanging and falling from the underside of a flying helicopter; “The Hunt Is On” (11 min.) gives us more on the helicopter chase and the New Zealand locations where it was filmed; “Cliffside Clash” (4 min.) looks at the climactic cliffside fight; “Foot Chase Musical Breakdown” (5 min.) allows us to listen to the individual musical components in the London foot-chase scene; and “The Ultimate Mission” (3 min.) wraps things up with Cruise talking about what makes the Mission: Impossible series special and why he keeps coming back to it. After that, we get a 4-minute deleted scenes montage with optional commentary with McQuarrie and Hamilton; hand-drawn storyboards for a number of scenes including the London foot-chase and the helicopter climax; and a theatrical trailer.

"Aug 5, 2018"," No, I don’t count the days until the next “Mission: Impossible” movie comes out, as I do with the “Star Wars” franchise and other series. But am I ever glad when the next installment arrives. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is a rollicking adrenaline-rush of a movie that’s well-written and beautifully directed by Christopher McQuarrie. McQuarrie has written a number of Cruise spotlights, including “Valkyrie,” “Edge of Tomorrow,” “Jack Reacher” and “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol.” McQuarrie knows how to shoot and direct Cruise so that the actor is at his best, whether Cruise is running full-speed toward a target, climbing a cliff, becoming involved in a fight in a washroom or shown in closeup as he desperately thinks of a way to escape a situation. Cruise, of course, reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, the spy on the Impossible Missions Force who is trying to save the world from a terrorist attack that involves three spheres of deadly plutonium. Cruise also is joined by the rest of the team including Simon Pegg as Benji, who provides a lot of the comic relief; Ving Rhames as Luther and Alec Baldwin. This time, the proceedings also include Angela Bassett as CIA director Erica Sloane and Henry Cavill as a CIA agent whose is assigned to accompany Hunt. As usual, Hunt is required to perform some death-defying feats. Among them are skydiving into a storm, a motorcycle chase through Paris, running through London (much to my delight, there’s a scene in St. Paul’s) and hanging from a helicopter. My favorite sequence, though, is the bathroom fight that includes the extraordinary Liang Yang, who deserves to have his own movie. This is one of the most entertaining scenes in the film, or in any other film this year. Wait until you see the clever ways the actors attack each other – just as with any other good fight scene, this one truly is a beautifully choreographed struggle. This is the sixth in a franchise that is 22 years old (how can that be?) The reboot of the television series was released in 1996. That means that the movies, like their star himself, just keep getting better with age. Whether you want to avoid the fact that you’ve taken all your vacation days this year, that school is just about to begin again or that not-so-many-weeks from now you’ll see the leaves turn, this is fantastic escapist fare that will help extend the summer just a little bit more.",POSITIVE
"Aug 4, 2018"," Tom Cruise is his maniac self in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the sixth installment in his steady franchise and proof that the actor is spectacularly certifiable. The movie is one “Wow!” moment after another—and proof that the guy shows no signs of slowing down more than half way through his fifth decade. The movie stacks stunt after stunt featuring Cruise doing everything from jumping out of airplanes to scaling cliffs to piloting his own helicopter. It also features Cruise leaping from one rooftop to another and breaking his ankle against a building. That stunt shut down production for weeks but remains in the film in all its bone-breaking glory. Do we really care about the plot when some of the best stunts and action scenes ever put to film are in play? Thankfully, the plot is the sort of fun, twisted story that has become the hallmark of this series, so you’ll be interested even when Cruise isn’t risking his life. Yes, there are a lot of “Hey, haven’t I seen that before?” moments—lots of masks being ripped off—but the labyrinthian hijinks still feel fresh overall. No, I’m not going to do much to explain it. That wouldn’t really do you any good. OK, I’ll tell you a little. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) finds himself on yet another mission to save the world, this time from nuclear terrorists headed by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the baddie from the franchise’s prior installment making a welcomed return. This time, Hunt is saddled with an “observer,” August Walker (Henry Cavill), tasked by CIA director Erica Sloan (a so-so Angela Bassett) with making sure Ethan and the Impossible Missions Force complete their mission with minimal funny stuff. Cruise is sick in the head for a myriad of reasons. Thankfully, one part of his sickness provides for movie stunts like the ones mentioned above. Cruise, in reteaming with frequent Cruise director Christopher McQuarrie, now the only director to have helmed two M:I films, pulls off his most spectacular cinematic feats yet. The skydive sequence, when Hunt works to save an unconscious co-jumper before they go splat, is a thousand strains of unbelievable. There’s a motorcycle chase through Paris streets that demands you see this thing on an IMAX screen. Cavill, whose facial hair has gotten a lot of attention this past year, gets a chance to stretch out and play someone far more interesting than his Kryptonian dud. The guy is a multi-dimensional badass here, especially in a bathroom brawl where Walker and Hunt try to take out a worthy opponent. Cavill shares in the glory of some of the film’s craziest stunts. That’s not him skydiving though. Cruise, also a producer on the film, forced Cavill to watch that sequence from the ground in favor of a stunt double. Alec Baldwin, the original Jack Ryan, takes a break from hosting Match Game to show that he can still throw some big-screen punches as Hunt’s new IMF commander. Vanessa Kirby is sinisterly terrific as White Widow, a sly arms dealer Hunt must confront. In her second go ’round, Rebecca Fergusson’s Ilsa Faust adds many elements of surprise. Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames deliver their usual competent support. And Lorne Balfe’s score deserves a big round of applause for its adrenaline-inducing contributions. Equalizer 2 stimulates that part of your brain that likes to see things go boom while allowing the part of your brain that seeks intellectual depth to go nappy time.",POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2018"," It’s a little mind-boggling to think of it now, but Tom Cruise’s first film role was a small part in the 1981 teen romance Endless Love.

"Aug 3, 2018"," A   estas alturas, después de seis entregas, explicar lo que pasa en Mission:        Impossible-Fallout es francamente innecesario. No importa –y esto aplica para muchas otras cintas– de qué trata la película sino lo que la película es: sus texturas, su ritmo, su esencia. La respuesta no está en desmenuzar los giros de tuerca o entender los muchos cambios de identidades y lealtades que ocurren durante sus casi dos horas y media de duración, sino en observar cómo fluye de una secuencia a otra. La clave, me parece, está en el apellido de un espía secreto que curiosamente nunca tiene un rostro concreto dentro de la cinta. La palabra es repetida hasta el cansancio, en boca de todos los personajes, desde el indestructible Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) y el antipático Walker (Henry Cavill) hasta Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), la femme fatale de la serie. La palabra es lark. Lark. Lark en inglés significa varias cosas, pero todas sus definiciones conjugan con el espíritu lúdico de esta y por lo menos las dos anteriores Mission: Impossible. Lark es una aventura de carácter ligero. Lark implica simpatía, un chiste, una travesura bienintencionada. Finalmente, Lark también se puede referir a una meta fácil de lograr. Ninguna película tan bien hecha e inteligente como Fallout utilizaría esta palabra cada cinco minutos sin saber o comprender la carga de su significado. A través de ella, el guion del también director Christopher McQuarrie nos dice lo que esta secuela es. Fallout sabe que las misiones que Hunt acepta no pueden ser tan imposibles si ya vamos en la sexta entrega. Sabe que su propósito es entretener con acrobacias y espectáculo de primerísimo nivel. Y sabe, sobre todo, que su mayor arma es el humor. No me refiero al humor de chistorete y pastelazo de una comedia de Judd Apatow, sino a la comedia física de Buster Keaton, a secuencias de acción que de tan inverosímiles y emocionantes te hacen gritar y carcajear en la sala. Las amenazas de los villanos carecen de peso, apenas vemos una gota de sangre, la violencia no acarrea ningún peligro, pero nada de esto importa en absoluto. Fallout es la mejor carpa, Cruise el mayor cirquero y el espectáculo que brindan es vibrante, frecuentemente hermoso, y dirigido y editado con una fluidez asombrosa, sin importar qué tan elaborada sea su coreografía. El cine hollywoodense no tiene una serie más ligera, más simpática o mejor hecha. Fallout es, en efecto, una lark. La mejor de todas.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2018"," An oft-relayed and perhaps apocryphal anecdote in entertainment circles involves Tom Cruise possessing the power to make whomever he’s speaking with feel like they’re the most important person in the universe, if only for an ephemeral, shining moment. It’s the kind of charisma that’s kept him improbably high on the star pecking order for decades; at this point he’s less a remnant of another era than a portent of some transcendent, posthuman future that only he can see. On screen, both as a star and producer, he’s lived out that mythically inclusive social skill: scores of performers have been invited to bathe in his star light, but Cruise is always the last man standing. “Why won’t you just die?!” his exasperated co-star, and current movie Superman, Henry Cavill, grumbles at Cruise in the new Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Oh Henry, you’ve so, so much to learn. It’s startling that Cruise could be that last super star standing, of course, given his very public fall in the wake of 2005’s infamous “couch-jumping”, which made him an early Hollywood victim of YouTube’s remorseless viral power. And yet, here we are. (Turns out those zillion early career profile headlines that read “Cruise Control” were onto something.) The Mission: Impossible series serves as a handy marker of his unusual longevity and image determination: his boyish, one-of-the-team charm of 1996’s first instalment pivoted to hubristic, ill-advised action movie heroism in 2000’s sequel, before a clever display of humbler domesticity in 2006’s series-resetting third chapter cleared the way for the all-conquering superhuman machine he piloted, to resounding favour, across 2011’s Ghost Protocol and 2015’s sparkling Rogue Nation. The latter capped a decade of breathtaking image rehabilitation, though the visible, franchise-centric effort came at the expense of anything resembling a riskier acting project. Meanwhile, Cruise’s quest for immortality took him to fascinatingly ludicrous extremes: saving the day by flying into an enormous, cosmic space womb containing multiple Cruise clones in 2013’s Oblivion, and literally being reborn over and over in 2014’s Edge of Tomorrow. If he appears to have settled into his middle-aged heroism since then, it’s not by anything resembling conventional standards. The sixth and latest Mission: Impossible might not be the greatest action movie ever made, as some hyperbolic pundits would have you believe (nor is it close to the series’ peak), but the Hollywood action movie bar remains so low that this energetic, craftsmanlike piece is certainly an antidote to the joyless, CGI-reliant slogs of the American summer’s to-date wan offerings. Directed, again, by Rogue Nation’s Christopher McQuarrie and shot through with a small handful of genuinely exhilarating sequences, Fallout works as hard for your vicarious thrill-seeking dollar as does its tireless star. How many times have the Avengers twisted an ankle leaping off their 10-centimetre green-screen ledges? Cruise would eat the Marvel Cinematic Universe for breakfast. The plot, such that it matters, might as well be transposed from a rustic Bond scenario, or at least every recent 007 adventure that’s attempted to justify its anachronistic existence in a post-Cold War world. Rogue Nation villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) returns with a terror group known as the Apostles, who’re attempting to overthrow world order but are basically just giving anarchists a bad name with their second-rate incel ramblings and a plot, straight out of 1965, to steal nuclear weapons and wreak havoc. The casing of the plutonium in question even calls to mind a juvenile gag from The Naked Gun. This is a good thing. Wouldn’t you know it, the situation puts Cruise’s IMF agent Ethan Hunt once again on the treason suspect list (you’d think he’d find more appreciative employers by this stage), and CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett, who deserves her own action franchise) assigns a him a shadow spy: August Walker (Cavill), an assassin with a moustache and quiff who looks like a combination of dishevelled 1930s swashbuckler and ’70s gay pin-up. You can practically feel the locker-room eroticism of Walker and Hunt’s mano-a-mano game of wits. Threaded throughout are Hunt’s dreams of his former wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), and intimations of his accountability for her disappearance, and the vengeful return of MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (the great Rebecca Ferguson, mostly squandered this time around). The two play a round of tag in Hunt’s emotional landscape, the film’s women, as ever, gathered in weird supplication around Cruise. Fallout lacks some of the personality and elegance of its predecessor, but in the tradition of Brian De Palma’s original, it neatly adheres to Howard Hawks’ maxim that “A good movie is three good scenes and no bad scenes” – and damn are they good ones here. Both the film’s brutal, and hilarious, bathroom fight and an extended, breakneck car chase through the streets of Paris would be highlights of lesser movies, but it’s Fallout’s final stretch that’s really something to behold: between Cruise’s reckless London rooftop acrobatics and a thunderous helicopter joust that’s set among the snowy peaks of Kashmir, McQuarrie and Cruise dazzle less with imagination than sheer force and scale. Throughout, it’s a never-ending source of wonder that Cruise, now 56 and notoriously older than some cast members of Cocoon, continues to freefall, leap, and run that famous run, bolt upright and sprinting like a battery-powered rabbit pursued by some unseen, terrifying adversary. When Bassett’s character dismisses the IMF as “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat”, it’d be easy to find an analogy to ageing action stars, yet something about Cruise’s commitment has reshaped the playing field to his design. While others of his vintage had long vanished into obscurity or, worse, politics, Cruise is wearing his crumpled, tough-guy youthfulness with a degree of credibility; if nothing else, he’s still the aspirational icon for middle-aged men in dubious leather jackets. What he doesn’t do much of is act; one misses the devious charm of that once-ubiquitous megawatt smile, or the complexity he was never given enough credit for in his roles playing the seedier fringes of humanity. Even as Fallout marches to a surprisingly generic ticking-clock-and-explosive climax, the action is energised by Cruise’s wild zeal, whether he’s hanging from a cliff face, turning a helicopter chase inside out, or facing down a foe on a mountain top, the overhead camera one rotation short of ushering in the opening bars of “November Rain”. (It’s fitting that Kashmir looks suspiciously like Middle-earth; New Zealand, in fact, doubles for northern India.) It’s on this grand plateau that Cruise reasserts his own abstracted model of masculinity, standing again as the final boss of Hollywood’s alpha men – despite being anything but a traditional one. A quick survey of Cruise’s career offers a glimpse of those who’ve stepped into his arena and been summarily dispatched: Val Kilmer, demoted to wingman in Top Gun; Brad Pitt, taunted and emasculated in Interview with the Vampire; Emilio Estevez, killed off sans credit in Mission: Impossible; Jeremy Renner, relegated to sidekick status in its sequels; the list goes on. (Non-threatening regulars like Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg get to stick around, affording Cruise the status of munificent team captain, the quarterback who’s friends with the geeks.) True to form, Fallout allows Cruise to put none other than the upstart Superman in his place. “That’s right, prick”, Hunt sneers while taking the upper hand over Cavill mid-chopper duel, sounding both the weary relief of a beleaguered screen hero and an affirmation of middle-aged superstardom. The bravado is even more curious when you consider Cruise’s increasingly asexual screen quality, making his dismissal of the film’s villainous masculinity – and surfeit of moustaches and beards – strangely satisfying. If there’s always been something maniacal about Cruise’s pursuit of perfection, then no one has ostensibly given as much to their audience, either. “The world needs people like you,” Bassett says over Fallout’s closing moments, as the IMF gang both old and new gather around to bathe in Ethan Hunt’s aura, his selflessness, as though an otherworldly prophet walked among them. It’s a bit much, to put it mildly, but when Mission: Impossible is at its best, it’s hard not to feel like we, too, have been graced by Cruise’s presence.

"Aug 3, 2018"," The weather is not the only thing heating up this summer as Noir on the Boulevard continues with the 1946 film ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" James M. Cain’s hard-boiled classic screens Sunday at 1:00 pm at Digital Gym Cinema. Lana Turner and John Garfield star in this tale of lust and murder that the Production Code Administration had at one point deemed ""definitely unsuitable for motion picture production."" Turner and Garfield generated on screen heat despite the restrictions of the Hays Code. The film was remade in 1981 with Jessica Lange and Jack Nicholson. Although the remake could be more sexually explicit, it failed to capture the same tension as the original.  Cain's novel had previously been filmed abroad as ""Le Dernier Tournant (The Last Turning)"" in France in 1939 and as ""Ossessione (Obsession)"" in Italy in 1943. Then on Monday the temperature continues to rise with the contemporary noir ""Body Heat,"" also part of the year-long noir series that I co-host at Digital Gym Cinema. ""Body Heat"" also boasts a very young Mickey Rourke in a key role. Now for something new: the latest entry in the ""Mission Impossible"" franchise, ""Fallout."" If this film only had its bathroom brawl (featuring Liang Yang), it would be worth the price of admission.  I was not a fan of the franchise until Brad Bird (directing the 2011 ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"") and Christopher McQuarrie (writing and directing ""Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation"" in 2015) re-energized it with humor and jaw-dropping action. One of the keys to the success of the franchise after Bird and McQuarrie is that they deflate Tom Cruise’s square-jawed action hero image by constantly beating the crap out of him, which I have to confess I really enjoy since he always seemed too smug on screen. Plot is irrelevant here, and made overly complicated, but what carries it is great fight choreography, chases and pacing and a ridiculous sense of fun. The opening captures the spirit of the original 1960s TV series created by Bruce Geller, and then McQuarrie (returning as writer-director) just keeps things zipping along. In the kick-ass bathroom fight, he uses no music and keeps the camera and editing simple to let the action just impress you.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2018"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a ferocious heart-pounding cardio workout in your cinema sweat. In moment after unrelenting moment Cruise dances with death; I found myself cringing and squirming in my place. Strap yourself in for the most undisputed contender as not only the best Mission movie, but without doubt the best action movie of the year. When Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) chooses the life of a member of his team, he unwittingly hands the Apostles (the remnants of Solomon Lane’s [Sean Harris] ‘Syndicate’ in Rogue Nation – only nastier) enough plutonium to create three devastating nuclear weapons. With the CIA’s August Walker (Henry Cavill) tagging along to keep the IMF in check, their mission is to prevent global atomic catastrophe. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie takes on a more difficult job than his predecessors. Rather than an amnesiac new ‘take’ on the franchise, he pushes Ethan beyond his limit (in more ways than one) and acknowledges everything in the series thus far. McQuarrie relishes the spy genre and the art of drip-feeding information to the audience. We feel like we’ve been given the upper hand, only to find out we’ve been toyed with again. The action is fed by emotion and elevated by a feeling of natural improvisation. The chase sequence through Paris (which goes for about thirty blistering minutes) involves multiple vehicle changes, scores of swarming (never hapless) police and ‘freelance’ spies interjecting. It is gloriously unrelenting. Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Ex Machina, Annihilation) has the formidable task of not only composing the atmospheric ‘underground’ spy genre mood, but steadily appraising each hair-raising stunt with blinding clarity. We see into Cruise’s oxygen mask during the HALO jump; we see Cruise’s foot skidding along the pavement in long turns through traffic; we see the infamous ankle-breaking leap between buildings; we see everything. Editor Eddie Hamilton and music composer Lorne Balfe complement one another, maintaining the film’s cardiac arrest pace. Cruise’s commitment to the physical is gobsmacking for a 56-year-old. He’s also carrying the woe of each raised gamble for the greater good, often allowing his fellow actors the space to shine. Rebecca Ferguson returns as the unforgettable Ilsa Faust. Just when we thought she was out, she’s lured back in – and her presence delivers the same brand of distraction for Ethan. Ving Rhames – big Luther – stretches out of his cynicism to provide some of the most emotionally piercing moments of the movie. Simon Pegg’s Benji’s promotion to nervous field agent makes him all the more lovable, playing a sort of C3PO to Cruise’s Han Solo. New addition Cavill – the battering ram CIA agent Walker – loves toeing the line between friend and foe. Angela Bassett, the CIA’s Erica Sloan, fills that Dame Judi Dench as “M” sized hole in your heart. When Mission: Impossible – Fallout ends, it may as well be shouting: “Are you not entertained?!” When you catch your breath and regain the power of speech, you’ll answer: “YES! AGAIN!”",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2018","Outside of his ambitious sci-fi movies, Cruise knows his Mission: Impossible. 22 years and six films in, he has perfected the art of convoluted international intrigue mixed with over-the-top stunts that he performs himself.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2018"," ""Franchise"" needn't be a dirty word in Hollywood, and the Mission: Impossible movies are shining examples as to why that is. Now in its sixth instalment, this isn't just a franchise done right. It's a franchise that somehow improves with each new chapter – an ongoing escalation of stakes and stunts that never sacrifices the intelligent, honest and light-hearted storytelling that's been so critical to the series' sustained appeal. At the forefront once again is leading man and producer Tom Cruise, whose capacity for performing increasingly complex and outrageously dangerous stunts remains inversely proportionate to his age. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout his IMF agent Ethan Hunt is at it again, weaving cars and motorbikes through the traffic-packed streets of Paris, HALO jumping from 30,000ft and leaping across rickety London rooftops. Cruise even accrued over 2000 hours of helicopter flight time prior to filming, all so that he could personally perform what is arguably the film's most thrilling and death-defying sequence. His love of filmmaking is apparent in every frame he occupies, and its value to the enduring allure of the franchise cannot be overstated. That the Mission Impossible brand could survive beyond Cruise's involvement seems far less assured than, say, James Bond or Batman. Not unlike the two most recent Bond films, Fallout compels its hero to shine a light on his own past deeds, with the movie's title referring not just to the literal threat posed by three nuclear devices but also the consequences of a lifetime spent obediently killing, stealing and undermining at the behest of the US Government. Adding to the emotional stakes, Fallout also repeatedly asks its characters to weigh up the value of a human life, presenting them with multiple scenarios in which they're forced to choose between the one or the many – knowing that either path carries with it irreconcilable guilt and heartache. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie (whose return to the franchise marks the first repeat involvement by a director, with McQuarrie having also written and directed the previous instalment, Rogue Nation), Fallout achieves the rare feat of being an unceasing action movie that always feels more like a drama. There is no superfluity here. Every punch, shot, jump, crash and explosion exists because it must. This is a story-driven international escapade that never stops to sit down and catch its breath. Around Cruise the IMF family assembles once again, with Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin and Rebecca Ferguson packing equal measures of comedy and conflict into every scene they get. Man of Steel's Henry Cavill also joins the action, with his lumbering, muscular CIA assassin representing an appealing counterpoint to Hunt's penchant for the softer, tradecraft touch. He and Hunt are at once rivals and compatriots – two competing assets unwillingly paired together in pursuit of a common goal. Or so it seems. As always, the Mission: Impossible franchise throws up all manner of red herrings, double-crosses and mask-pulling identity swaps, meaning – just like the characters – you're never quite sure who to trust. If the story borders on confusing at points, it's only because the time-honoured tradition of spy movies commands nothing less. Ever since 1996, this series has unapologetically embraced jargon-heavy dialogue and twists upon twists without ever feeling compelled to play it safe or dumb things down (Mission: Impossible 2 being the regretful exception). If most sequels fail because they're rushed into production purely to capitalise on their predecessor's success, Fallout demonstrates the benefit of having the patience and the discipline to say: we will make this film not when, but if a good enough story comes our way. So it is that McQuarrie, Cruise and company deliver a benchmark setter for action movies – a rollicking, tense and captivating piece of cinema that begs to be enjoyed on the big screen.",POSITIVE

"Aug 2, 2018"," With the Resident Evil saga apparently complete and no further Mad Max adventures on the immediate horizon, Mission: Impossible must qualify as the best Hollywood action series now going. Six films in, we don't know much about Ethan Hunt, the dashing super spy played by Tom Cruise. But then we don't know much about Cruise, either. There he is in his mid 50s, still inscrutably ""boyish"", still enthralled by the dream of his own magnetism, still willing to take on any challenge as long as it involves a lot of running. Cruise can fascinate in many contexts, but it's clear he thinks of himself as a physical performer above all, and  his insistence on doing his own stunts isn't an incidental vanity but the essence of the thing. Why bother with action movies if you don't personally get to jump onto a helicopter or claw your way up the side of a cliff? Such physical commitment is an undervalued component of screen acting in general, at least when it occurs outside of heavy drama. Cruise will never win an Oscar for playing Hunt, but what he does in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is surely at least as taxing as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio's role in The Revenant, with the added obligation of making it look like fun. The Mission: Impossible formula balances Cruise's circus daredevilry with the use of digital effects, especially when characters tear off Scooby Doo masks to reveal they were really someone else all along. This magic trick fits with the skill set of series overseer Christopher McQuarrie, whose knack for plot twists has been evident ever since he made his name in the 1990s as the screenwriter of The Usual Suspects. Fallout dispatches Hunt, the show pony of the globetrotting Impossible Mission Force, on a race against time to recover a stolen batch of plutonium. Ving Rhames​ returns as the team's sturdy taskmaster Luther, and Simon Pegg​ as the voice of reason Benji, essentially a cardboard cutout wearing a sign that says ""comedy sidekick"". Others in the support staff include Sean Harris as an intellectual villain railing from captivity, Angela Bassett as a CIA chief making asides about waterboarding, Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan striving to give credibility to the concept of Hunt as a lover, and Vanessa Kirby as a not very fatale femme fatale whose duplicity is played mostly for laughs. As a new team member with an advanced diploma in thuggery, Henry Cavill​ stands around giving Cruise amused, almost flirtatious glances, wearing an absurd moustache seemingly assigned to prevent anyone judging him the better-looking of the two. Disappointingly, Fallout breaks the Mission: Impossible tradition of having a different director tackle each instalment. But it's no mystery why McQuarrie is back, since his approach plays to Cruise's strengths: his idea of a good action sequence involves abrupt shifts of rhythm and constructing chains of events that aim for maximum unlikelihood without actually breaking the laws of physics. The best of these has Hunt racing over the rooftops of London, fearlessly following the instructions he receives from Luther, who plots the course from afar while failing to realise his operative is not positioned at ground level. It's a scenario that Cruise's pal Ben Stiller could have exploited for slapstick, with results that would be different but not entirely: Hunt resembles not only an avatar in a video game, but an actor willing to accept without question any direction he is given. When Hunt is, as usual, ""cut loose"" from his puppet-masters, McQuarrie seems to think he has an opportunity to delve into the character's morally ambiguous side. Cruise being Cruise, this doesn't come to much. Still, folded into his assurance is a degree of vulnerability, allowing Hunt glimmers of recognition that even he might have his limits. Scenes where Hunt attempts to make sense of Fallout's plot incorporate many variants on his patented three-point turn: a beat of hesitation, a grin of disbelief at having momentarily lost his cool, then a look around for confirmation he's not the only one in the dark. ""If even I don't get it,"" the whole display says, ""then it must be pretty damn confusing.""",NEUTRAL

"Aug 2, 2018"," These days when I watch a Tom Cruise film I find myself obsessing over the first few close ups, admiring the way his face continues to defy gravity. At my age I can't help but be impressed and wonder: is it botox, diet, or good genes?  But there's barely a moment for this personal ritual in Mission: Impossible — Fallout, because the opening scene kicks off so quickly, with an explosive cocktail of terrorists and weapons-grade plutonium. The studio behind Fallout claims it's one of the best action films ever made, and more than a few critics are falling into line with the idea. It's certainly got selling points: Cruise flies his own chopper, there's barely any CGI and he even broke his ankle performing one of the stunts. That said, the MI franchise hasn't exactly been limping along all this time. The last instalment, 2015's Rogue Nation — also written and directed by longtime Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie — pulled off some of the most extravagant car chases in recent memory. His nemesis from the last movie, the anarcho-terrorist Solomon Lane (played by Sean Harris), is now behind bars but still appears to be pulling some strings. Harris plays the villain with a softly spoken menace that vaguely recalls Ripley's-era Jack Palance. It's a dumbed-down Hollywood idea of an anarchist, to be sure, but his cartoon nihilism helps bring into focus Ethan's world view, which is defined by fierce loyalty to friends and an ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan). Our hero is no James Bond, in other words. He's a team player, and while various women in the film seem attracted to him — including sexy, lethal MI6 frenemy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson reprising her role) and a mysterious Parisian socialite-slash-arms dealer known as the White Widow (The Crown's Vanessa Kirby) — interactions with the opposite sex are more about foreplay than conquest. His returning ""wingmen"" — a term, fittingly, made popular by Cruise's early hit Top Gun — include a geeky Brit (Simon Pegg), an African American tech expert (Ving Rhames) and a besuited manager who's also a buffer keeping top brass at bay (Alec Baldwin). Unfortunately for Ethan, this top brass have sent someone new to watch him. British actor Henry Cavill — the tall, dark, and least memorable Superman — plays a young CIA hotshot with permission to shoot anyone who goes rogue. Ethan doesn't like this one bit, and senses ulterior motives. The tension between these two characters is one of the film's better power-plays, and it sets up a late payoff of middle-aged vindication that would make Clint Eastwood proud. Cruise is now 56, and he's kept himself in impeccable shape. He still fits into those figure hugging leather jackets, and he runs like he has wads of springy cartilage in those middle-aged knees, with his hands flat, scything through the air. But with each knock, each fall, the body doesn't bounce back like it used to. And the beauty of Cruise's performance is his ability to show physical wear and tear in small gestures. A slight limp, a hunch, a shiver. He's been letting himself get battered on screen for a while, at least as far back as War of the Worlds, and often with a dash of comedy. Cruise is a talented, sympathetic ham, which combines nicely with the some of the franchise's more tongue-in-cheek plot twists (where else will you see a modern-day thriller where rubber face masks are used as a credible disguise?). He's a nuanced emotional actor when he needs to be, but there's not a lot required of him in Fallout — even with an ex-wife who opens the film as a ghostly apparition and returns in the flesh later on, sending shivers. Essentially this is a rollicking action film, with McQuarrie showing off how he can slide the camera around city streets — notably Paris — or through the air as Cruise jumps between buildings. Cruise, who is a producer on the film and would've co-signed off on the insurance risk, not only flies the chopper but hangs from it with his bare hands. Mission Impossible? More like a case of Cruise control.

"Aug 2, 2018"," That’s impressive, considering the various death-defying situations special agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) finds himself in over the two-and-a-half-hour running time. The IMF operative starts out wrangling a suitcase full of plutonium in the atmospheric underbelly of Belfast and ends up ripping across the ice fields of Kashmir in a flaming helicopter. But what makes the sixth and best installment of the M:I franchise more than an obnoxiously loud crash-and-bang popcorn flick is the feeling we’re watching characters who actually care for each other. Cruise performed many of his own stunts, at one point breaking his ankle while jumping from building to building with a nimbleness that makes one forget he’s closing in on 60. But his greatest accomplishment here is making it seem that he’s fixated on more than saving the world from a rogue special-agent splinter group with a couple of nuclear bombs. The people he’s most concerned about protecting are those closest to him, whether it’s wisecracking, in-over-his-head systems analyst Benji (Simon Pegg) or a desperate-to-get-out-of-the-game government assassin (Rebecca Ferguson). The smoking helicopter wrecks and motorcycle mayhem near the Arc de Triomphe are Fallout’s money shots. But as much as it’s one of the greatest action films, well, ever, what makes Fallout the best film in the franchise is that it has a soul. Witness Ferguson’s conflicted (and entirely badass) hit woman, Ilsa Faust, unable to pull the trigger on Hunt at a crucial moment, and Hunt’s repeated flashbacks to the wife (played by Michelle Monaghan) he’s abandoned to ensure her safety. Returning as both screenwriter and director, Christopher McQuarrie packs the space between action sequences with enough twists and turns that you need to pay attention to avoid getting lost. Keeping us engaged is a support cast every bit as dialled in as Cruise, standouts including, but not limited to, Henry Cavill as off-puttingly overconfident CIA operative August Walker, and Vanessa Kirby as a mysterious international-deals broker named White Widow. Smartly, Fallout knows that the best international-espionage thrillers are the ones that throw us into worlds we’ll never normally see, whether it’s a retro-swank cocktail club in the City of Light or a ramshackle wooden hut in the mountains of Kashmir. More importantly, it understands that the greatest backdrops in the world are useless if we don’t care about the people in them. Gord Downie of the Tragically Hip once suggested that he would like to fight Mike Usinger. For which Mike Usinger didn't blame him one bit. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2018"," The 2018 summer release schedule is crammed full of limp, sad, flavorless, nobody-asked-for-this-shit sequels. There are now two The Equalizer movies, three Hotel Transylvania movies and four The Purge movies. A new hope for a Star Wars comeback fades far, far away with each passing release. All Marvel movies remain as insipidly anonymous as ever, no matter who directs. The Harry Potter extended universe is running on the fumes coming off Johnny Depp’s mustache. Ben Affleck is Batman. All of this is to say that while Mission: Impossible has become arguably the best and certainly the most reliable blockbuster movie franchise in circulation, it certainly doesn’t have a lot of competition for the titles. Still, that’s not a knock against Christopher McQuarrie’s vigorously entertaining Fallout, the sixth movie starring Tom Cruise as indestructible superspy Ethan Hunt. It’s as polished, precision-tuned and effective a piece of filmmaking as you’re likely to see all year long. The most impressive thing about the Mission: Impossible movies, especially these last three entries, is that they have settled into a comfortable and familiar formula filled with recurring characters and nostalgic callbacks without lowering the bar. Nothing in Fallout should feel unfamiliar to anyone remotely aware of the Mission: Impossible bag of tropes. Motorcycles race through metropolises, rubber faces get ripped off, bomb timers tick down and Cruise runs and runs and runs. Even Fallout’s plot—Hunt and his team chase a shadowy terrorist organization threatening nuclear destruction, despite getting disavowed by their own governments—feels 100 percent recycled. Yet none of this stops McQuarrie from staging one astounding action sequence after another, from an oxygen-deprived parachute jump over Paris to a helicopter chase through Kashmir. Despite the familiarity, Fallout is one of the freshest films of the year. With Fallout, director and co-writer McQuarrie becomes the first person to helm a second Mission: Impossible movie, even bringing back Rogue Nation bad guy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) to serve as Hunt’s main nemesis. Hunt’s team of wisecracking, crackerjack safecrackers also remains largely intact from the previous films: fan favorites Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg take another lap, while Rebecca Ferguson has been re-upped from Rogue Nation (good call) and Jeremy Renner has been jettisoned (great call). The one major new addition to the cast is Henry Cavill as CIA assassin August Walker. New blood or not, Mission: Impossible remains Cruise’s show. For all the CGI tastefully slathered across Fallout, Cruise remains one of the most believable action heroes in the world, still performing many of his own death-defying stunts at 56 (I’m exactly as old as Cruise was when he made Mission: Impossible III and I hurt my neck last week while sleeping, but that’s beside the point). I don’t know how long Cruise can keep it up, but I’d happily consume a new Mission: Impossible movie every summer. What started out in the TV series—and to a lesser degree in the first movie—as a sort of modern-day “Have Gun, Will Travel” is reduced this time to a simple revenge fantasy.",POSITIVE

Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a franchise, so it's prepackaged. It's patented, not creative. It may be tasty, but it's not fulfilling.
The latest episode of the Franchise is all over the place. The Mission Impossible force plays whack-a-mole. It's a game, distended to 2 1/2 hours.
It's too much, too often. It tries hard to be generic. It chases after its own tale. Audiences seem to favor that.
In many ways Mission: Impossible - Fallout is a paramount example of contemporary film. Stunts overwhelm character. Acting falls far behind motion.
Director/writer Christopher McQuarrie is an appropriate representative of the contemporary filmmaker. McQuarrie started out as a clever, imaginative, unique screenwriter. He won an Oscar for writing the enticing The Usual Suspects (1995).
Even though he's credited with the screenplay for Mission: Impossible - Fallout, he's essentially not a writer anymore.
Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the 4th film McQuarrie has directed. He's controlled by the genre. Words hardly matter. Stunts shove aside language. McQuarrie is now an action director.
Much of the publicity centers on the fact that Tom Cruise did many of his own stunts. But Cruise on a motorcycle is not worth 1,000 words. 1,000 words are worth 1,000 words. But in a lot of films today, they're worth nothing.
Cruise as Ethan Hunt coasts through Mission: Impossible - Fallout. Cruise flies, flops, and flounders. He doesn't do much acting. He could just as well have been wearing one of the rubber masks the Franchise loves.
I've always thought that Tom Cruise is an underrated actor. He has the talent to take more challenges. I hope he will. I think he should.
Cruise may deserve a more challenging director than McQuarrie. Most major actors stay with one director for several films. But Cruise hadn't until he made two films with Steven Spielberg (Minority Report, 2002 and War of the Worlds, 2005).
Now Cruise has made three films directed by McQuarrie: Jack Reacher (2012), Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015), and Mission: Impossible - Fallout. They challenged his body, but not his soul. Actually McQuarrie did recognize Cruise's soul in Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, which makes it more depressing that he ignores it in Mission: Impossible - Fallout.
But there are several directors who have elicited memorable performances from Cruise. Cruise's past directors are a litany of Who's Who among the foremost modern directors. They reached the soul of the actor.
It's a stellar list: Barry Levinson (Rain Man, 1988), Michael Mann (Collateral, 2004), Paul Thomas Anderson (Magnolia, 1999), Oliver Stone (Born on the Fourth of July, 1989), Sydney Pollack (The Firm, 1993), Stanley Kubrick (Eyes Wide Shut, 1999), and Marty Scorsese (The Color of Money, 1986).
In The Color of Money, Cruise helped Paul Newman win his first and only Oscar. May he join him.
The supporting cast backing up Cruise in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is forgettable. Simon Pegg is lively as Benji, and Ving Rhames as Luther has one of the few genuine moments when he explains Hunt to Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson).
But usually cardboard figures would suffice. The villains are hairy and nondescript. The women are attractive.
The action sequences overwhelm character. The film's flights of fancy are helicopter chases, following rote car chases. Where's John Frankenheimer when we need him?
The screenplay offers clichés. Guess how many seconds are left in a countdown when Hunt saves the world? It couldn't be one, could it?
The screenplay does offer one telling line.
At one point, on the run Hunt yells, ""I'm being followed.""
His contact asks, ""CIA or Apostles?""
Hunt responds, ""Does it matter?""
In Mission: Impossible - Fallout, that line says it all.

"Aug 2, 2018"," You can hold his shambolic personal life against him, you can find his connections to Scientology repugnant, but as soon as his face is on that big screen and he turns and flashes that $20 million toothy smile, he’s hooked you.  His charm and screen presence is undeniable and everything else surrounding the off-screen Cruise melts away. And when it comes to the Mission: Impossible franchise, he is peak Tom Cruise.  Which is why after 22 years playing Ethan Hunt, this franchise is still so successful at thrilling audiences with its mad daredevil stunts, heart-thumping action sequences and its promise of a bloody entertaining time. A promise it fulfils and then some because Mission: Impossible — Fallout is the best action movie of 2018 so far. Because how do you argue with a movie that pummels you with insane helicopter chases, intense hand-to-hand combat, a riveting motorcycle chase across Paris and more Tom Cruise running than you’ve ever seen before? You can’t. You just can’t. Set two years after the last instalment, Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, the dastardly Syndicate group has morphed into the Apostles after the capture of its leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). When Ethan (Cruise), Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) receive intel that fundamentalist members of the Apostles plan to detonate three nuclear bombs in crowded religious centres, the team tries to disrupt the sale of the plutonium cores. The mission fails when Ethan chooses to save Luther’s life and the bombs are in the wind. After the latest cock-up, CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) sends her agent August Walker (a moustachioed Henry Cavill) on the next mission with Ethan. The mission puts them in the path of a duplicitous arms dealer named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) who is to serve as an intermediary for the plutonium cores, which Ethan can only get his hands on if he agrees to free Lane.  He also faces off with Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), the MI5 agent who’s determined to kill Lane. Ferguson’s return is a first for the franchise, which usually leaves its female cast members behind, only carrying over the men from one film to the next. Ditto with director Christopher McQuarrie, who previously directed Rogue Nation, becoming the first MI repeat director. Michelle Monaghan, who played Ethan’s wife Julia in the third movie — she has popped up in cameo form once before and also returns in Fallout, which is supposed to be the culmination of all of Ethan’s choices up to this point, coming home to roost.  Mission Impossible has never been super concerned about legacy until now and it’s refreshing to see it devote so much story time and character development to the consequences of Ethan’s decades gallivanting around the world playing hero, which tends to leave a lot of collateral damage. The story progression, as you’d expect from a spy thriller, has many twists and turns, double-triple-quadruple crosses, some of which you see coming from way off and some you don’t, and some of which is really stretching the realm of reality. It’s not the strongest element of the movie but it’ll do — it’s best you don’t think about it too hard. It’s not just that Ethan Hunt HALO jumps out of plane 25,000 feet above the Earth’s surface in a vertigo-inducing sequence, it’s that Tom Cruise HALO jumps out of a plane 25,000 feet above the Earth’s surface. It’s Tom Cruise who learnt to fly a helicopter so he could do a barrel roll flying over New Zealand’s South Island (standing in for Kashmir), it’s Tom Cruise racing through the backstreets behind the Paris Opera on a motorcycle and it’s Tom Cruise who broke his leg leaping across rooftops next to the Thames in London. The franchise’s commitment to practical effects and stunning real-life locations, rather than copiously using CGI and green screen like its contemporaries, isn’t some movie star’s vanity project. It creates a real sense of jeopardy for the audience. You’re constantly catching your breath.  The only thing that lets the movie down (some story issues and one weirdly edited scene aside) is that it starts to drag in the last act. Coming in at almost two-and-a-half hours, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is definitely one action sequence too long, though I’d be pressed to nominate one to omit — a small quibble but one that prevents it from being a perfect action movie. So close. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2018"," Like, it seems, most people on Twitter who watch movies, your film editor undertook the admittedly enjoyable task of revisiting the entire Mission: Impossible film franchise in preparation for the release of its sixth entry, Mission: Impossible â Fallout. Itâs something of a whiplash-inducing experience, as so much of the series to date has flown in the face of continuity; each film was the work of a different director and usually a different writer (or writers), and each film introduced a new villain, new female lead, and new skeptical boss for the seriesâ hero, Ethan Hunt, played by Tom Cruise. In fact, Cruise and co-star Ving Rhames are the only constants in every picture (and even Rhames only makes a cameo in the fourth entry). But around the time of 2015âs Mission: Impossible â Rogue Nation, the films began to settle on something of a house style, via the contributions of third entry director (and producer of each subsequent film) J.J. Abrams, and marking the third appearance of co-star Simon Pegg, and the second of Jeremy Renner. Rennerâs absence from Fallout is a bit of a disappointment, as itâs otherwise the most direct sequel in the series to date â marking the return of not just the previous pictureâs writer/director (Christopher McQuarrie), but its villain (Sean Harris), its bossman (Alec Baldwin) and, best of all, its kinda-sorta romantic interest (Rebecca Ferguson). As usual, the plot is somehow both simple and maddeningly complicated. The Apostles, a splinter cell of The Syndicate (the previous filmâs crew of rogue agents-turned-terrorists), have acquired three stolen plutonium spheres. Ethan and his team are charged with getting them back â but the undercover buy goes sideways, and Ethan has to let them go to save Luther (Rhames). And thus begins an elaborate ruse to acquire them again, which requires Hunt going under deep cover as an international terrorist and coordinating the esape of Solomon Lane (Harris), whom he put away in the last film, and â look, I could fill this entire review with plot machinations and double-crosses (if I even followed all of them, and thatâs a big if) and youâd skim right past them (if you havenât already), because thatâs not what weâre at a Mission: Impossible movie to see. Weâre there for the set pieces, the big action beats in which Tom Cruise risks his life and intricate identity swaps are performed and computers are hacked with split-second specificity, and here is where a word of warning is warranted: Fallout does not move at quite the same accelerated clip as the more recent entries. It runs a heftier-than-usual 147 minutes, and much of that excess comes in the first half-hour, when McQuarrie does a fair amount of table-setting (perhaps a bit more than is necessary, what with the aforementioned continuity to the previous entry). And the action takes a while to ramp up â there are moments, to be sure, like Cruiseâs much-vaunted halo drop above Paris, or the wall-breaking bathroom fight in which Cruise and spook chaperone Henry Cavill try to take down a particularly resilient bad guy (and, more importantly, Mr. Cavill loads his fists). But McQuarrie doesnât really put the pedal to the floor until his big Parisian car/truck/motorcycle chase scene, and even then, the film is closer to the talky-spy-movie-with-action-beats of the first two entries than the (admittedly breathless) tumult-of-set-pieces structure the recent films have strived for. The most important piece of the Paris chase is a quiet, breath-held moment with an unfortunate cop; before it plunges in to the bonkers closing sequence, McQuarrieâs script gives Luther a lovely little explainer about his friend, and love, and loyalty. In those moments, Fallout is acknowledging its heroâs age, and something else thatâs often eluded these movies: a sense of history. Sure, theyâll call back to the Langley heist (usually as a point of comparison to whatever difficult extraction theyâre attempting next), but the new film is full of little shout-outs to the earlier pictures: a character linked to Vanessa Redgraveâs Max from the first film, an ingenious scene that recalls that pictureâs cold open, a key moment in which Ethan must call upon those rock climbing skills from the second entry. And yet, those moments arenât just about this new spirit of continuation, nor are they winking, Marvel-style fan service. They instead make Fallout feel like the ultimate mission, one where our hero must call upon all the skills he knows, and everything he can do.",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2018"," Film franchises may rise and fall in quality, but it now seems Mission Impossible will just keep on going from strength to strength if the thrilling big-screen joyride of this latest adventure is anything to go by. As a loving nod to surviving fans of Bruce Geller’s classic TV series, Mission Impossible: Fallout opens with a nostalgic touch featuring the old self-destructing reel-to-reel tape recorder that kicked off each episode by delivering the team’s mission – should they decide to accept it, of course. Here, the gig it delivers to Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise, as if you didn’t know) and his IMF (Impossible Mission Force, as if you didn’t know) is to track down and secure three big baubles of plutonium and so prevent them from getting into the hands of a particularly nasty villain. Admittedly, it’s a chestnut of a plot that seems designed to acknowledge the franchise’s debt to Bond. From there, buckle up as Fallout catapaults you on a propulsive ride through the white-knuckle rapids of a fast-moving plot that offers a near-perfect blend of old-school cliffhanger movie aesthetics with state of the art filmmaking technology. Studded with some truly extraordinary sequences, Cruise is centre-frame for some truly gasp-inducing sequences, including a stunning footchase across London roof tops that the camera sometimes strains to keep up with. For good measure, there’s also an extended motorcycle chase, a twirling car chase, a throat tightening sky dive and a breathless helicopter finale. These more than make up for one of the mistakes of the previous film, Rogue Nation, where Cruise did his headlining stunt before the opening credits. Though working with the world’s biggest movie star, director Christopher McQuarrie (Jack Reacher; Rogue Nation) is careful to keep the ensemble vibe crackling among the cast, which include regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames along with Alec Baldwin, Sean Harris (great as the bad guy), Michelle Monaghan, Angela Bassett (where has she been?) and Henry Cavill. Best-known for Superman, Cavill is a particular delight as a dubious tower of cartoonish menace. He sports a classic porn-movie moustache and does a fab job as a suss CIA interloper whose job is to watch over how the Mission Impossible crew operates, with his eyes especially trained on Hunt. Amidst all the mandatory mayhem, McQuarrie wisely inserts a few well-judged grace notes to ground the adventure with a touch of humanity, the best being Hunt’s encounter with an anonymous French police officer. It’s a device often used by directors (Quentin Tarantino; John Woo; Ben Affleck; Simon West; Michael Bay) to inject a glint of perspective into an otherwise busy action scene. Though the film maintains the style of the series there is a noticeable Bourne influence with some of the kinetic cinematography; as in previous MI films,  McQuarrie also turns off the orchestra occasionally to let the grinding of machines and the chatter of automatic weapons provide the soundtrack. And given how so much of the MI action is predicated on elaborate set ups that don’t quite work – equipment fails; people get away; jumps don’t quite make it, etc – this just adds to the volumes of tension already there. In all, this is rock-solid, sure-fire entertainment. As far action cinema goes, it joins Bourne, the Fast and the Furious, Transformers and the Dark Knight trilogy as a franchise setting the pace in the 21st century. Without any noticeable shift in his cold-fire demeanour, Denzel Washington calmly saunters back into his no-nonsense role as Robert McCall, the self-appointed angel of justice who rights wrongs with brutal force when not driving his Lyft hire car around the streets of Boston. Thankfully, there’s no messing with the formula that made the 2014 film, based on the classic 1980s Edward Woodward TV series, such a huge hit. Director Antoine Fuqua, who steered Washington to his Best Actor Oscar for Training Day (2001), is back, as is the pungency of righteous revenge that motivates McCall. Sweetening things this time around is his relationship with a local teen called Miles (Ashton Sanders, from Moonlight), a kid wth a good heart who is in danger of getting tied up with the wrong crowd. McCall knows precisely what that crowd is like and so uses it to formulate a memorable life lesson for his young charge. As is Fuqua’s style, the film’s spurts of violence are accompanied with arguably excessive amounts of blood. There is a disturbing vivdness to some scenes, but it is Washington’s compelling presence throughout that makes this such a solid, value-driven action thriller. If there is a main difference from the previous film, it’s the up-dialling of old-school religious values. The magnificently tense finale, which takes place in an evacuated coastal town about to be torn apart by a hurricane – echoes to classic westerns and Phil Noyce’s A Clear and Present Danger abound – has so many religious references it’s hard to keep count. Such symbolism might be there for those looking for them, still they do not distract Washington fans from enjoying the film for the high-end, cathartic thriller it is. More is surely to come. Pryce plays Joe Castleman, an author who embarks on an ego-massaging trip to Sweden when he is told he is to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature. Along for the ride amidst all the sycophancy is his wife Joan (Close). She believes she is the only one who knows the truth beneath all the ceremonial brown-nosing until she encounters keen-as-beans author Nathaniel Bone (Christian Slater) who is doing an unauthorised tell-all biography of Joe. The film, directed with a fine eye for irony by Swedish filmmaker Bjorn Runge, is a marvellous performance showcase for Pryce and Close, two veterans whose around-the-block credentials shine brightest in the film’s quieter moments. Hot on the heels of the lauable Nick Broomfield documentary Can I Be Me comes another very good, very detailed, very depressing feature-length deep dive into the marvellously calculated rise and heart-breaking downfall of singer Whitney Houston. The chief advantage with Kevin Macdonald’s absorbing profile is that the film is “authorised” by Houston’s estate, which allowed him access to private footage and to those who were closest to Houston, including husband Bobby Brown. Embedded in the chronicle is the life and fate of daughter Bobbi Kristina, whose promising life was bound by the combination of global success and substance abuse that came to define Houston’s life. That her tale of potential denied so closely reflects her mother’s makes these sequences especially painful to watch. Whichever way you cut it, the lifestyle Houston lead as a superstar was exceptional, brilliant and tragic, full of human leeches, hangers on and enablers who took advantage of a good-hearted woman whose generosity of spirit might have been her greatest flaw. As well as being a noted feature filmmaker – the Oscar-winning The Last King of Scotland (2006; Forest Whitaker, Best Actor), State of Play (2009) and Black Sea (2014) – Macdonald is a distinguished doco-maker, with a CV that boasts the Oscar-winning One Day in September (1999), Touching the Void (2003), Life in a Day (2011) and Marley (2012). With Whitney he again plumbs into the soul of his subject to reveal fresh perspectives on known events along with revelations long hidden from view, all shaped by his skills as a cinematic storyteller. As far as cautionary tales go, Houston’s joins a long line that includes Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, Amy Whinehouse and Janis Joplin. The film sanguinely  captures the razor’s edge of planetary fame, as well as the long-term consequences of childhood trauma. It’s a must-see for anyone with even a passing interest in the Whitney Houston story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2018"," Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt in the sixth of the series of movies based on the “Mission: Impossible” TV show. Once again audiences get to thrill to the sound of Lalo Schifrin’s musical theme, a true highlight of any “MI” movie. And they get to once more see most of the old gang – Benji (Simon Pegg), Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Other familiar faces from the past pop up in a few scenes. The heart of the film is still Hunt’s love and loyalty to his ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). There are flashbacks early on that show she is still on his mind. He loves her, but he can’t be with her without putting her in jeopardy. Then there is also that romantic feeling he has for Ilsa. Where the movie soars is in the action sequences. Old Tom Cruise (he’s over fifty) is still running, jumping, fighting like a twenty year old. And if the statements issued by the studio are correct he does most, if not all, of his own stunts. You can look as closely as possible and try to find a stuntman’s face but it never happens. Still the action sequences are the best things about the movie and also the worst. The makers of this movie should have remembered you can overplay the hand. If a car chase will rev up the excitement then how about a motorcycle chase to out do that. And, wait for it, if these two chases get the adrenalin going then surely a helicopter chase would blow audiences out of their seats. It is so repetitive it becomes too much of a good thing. This also applies to the plot. Henry Cavil is cast as Walker, a CIA agent assigned to work with the IMF team. Early on you have doubts as to this man’s loyalty so it becomes an is he or isn’t he an opponent of the IMF mission . Then along comes Ilsa and her actions make you wonder if she is true blue too. There are plot twists on top of plot twists so that by the time you get to the end of the movie you don’t really care that there has been a big plot reveal. Cruise certainly has the Ethan Hunt character down pat, and his ability to do so many stunts is an amazing thing to see. Still it wouldn’t have been a “Mission: Impossible” movie if Benji and Luther hadn’t been along for the ride. As soon as either of these two appear on the screen you know you are going to have a good time. If you like action/adventure movies you are going to have a great time. It is all good – but you might be like me and think there can be a little too much of a good thing. He is familiar to people living in the middle Georgia area as the ""entertainment man"" since his entertainment reviews run in newspapers and are shown on television there. ",POSITIVE

"Aug 1, 2018"," The actor refuses to hang it up in the sixth Mission Impossible film – a movie thin in plot but packed with astonishing visuals and thrilling action sequences. A hundred years ago, Louis Aragon invented a new way of seeing films, specifically those “dear old American adventures” that discovered in everyday images of modernity – “the vertiginous, 1,000-eyed facade of the thirty-storey house” – something marvellous, “a novel poetry for minds able to respond to it”. Two-thirds of the way through the sixth Mission: Impossible, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), seen from directly above, runs up the inside of the dome of St Paul’s, runs across its roof, jumps across a series of alleys, runs through offices, jumps on to the roof of Blackfriars Bridge, runs across it – tracked from the side, framed against the city skyline – then to Tate Modern, where he follows his prey, August Walker (Henry Cavill), in a lift to the very top of the chimney – only to see Walker and his confederates fly away in a helicopter. Hunt is shown standing amid the thickets of skyscrapers, almost all of them erected in the years since his first visit to London in 1996, in a dizzying aerial shot. Why is Walker being picked up from the top of Tate Modern, exactly? Because it looks extraordinary. Why, earlier on, do Hunt and Walker, a CIA agent who has been imposed on Hunt’s IMF team, need to parachute into Paris – through a lightning storm moreover – rather than, say, use rubber masks as usual? Well, there is a narrative explanation, but it fools no one: the real reason is that it makes possible some of the most astonishing images of the year – the camera makes the leap first, looking up at the plane as Hunt comes to the edge of the ramp. Another of the most thrilling sequences is a motorcycle chase through the centre of Paris. There is always chatter about the realness of the stunts in a Mission: Impossible movie, but what matters is the IMAX sensation of almost being hit by cars, however it’s achieved. It can’t be a coincidence that this chase passes through the avenue de l’Opéra, one of the roads built by Baron Haussmann in the late 19th century, sweeping away the old arcades evoked by Aragon in Le Passage de l’Opéra, published in 1924. “Future mysteries,” he wrote then, “will arise from the ruins of today’s.” Part of the Mission: Impossible franchise’s charm is that it has never bothered much with continuity. Fallout makes more of an effort than most entries. It has the bad guy from the last instalment, Rogue Nation (2015), and Rebecca Ferguson, that film’s star turn, is back as rogue MI6 agent Ilsa Faust. Reaching further back, it has Vanessa Kirby in a pleasing performance as the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave’s character in the first film. It also has Michelle Monaghan as Hunt’s consciously uncoupled wife – heroine of the third film, but left out of all but one scene since then because Hunt, according to the fourth film, Ghost Protocol (2011), has to be a man without attachments. Except that the mutual attraction between Hunt and Ilsa – Hunt’s deadly equal and sometimes rival – was the mainspring of Rogue Nation. This one ends with the two not dissimilar-looking women in Hunt’s life standing by his field-hospital bed, one whispering a secret we can’t hear into the other’s ear, apparently bonding over their shared affection for a man who – for the good of mankind – cannot return it, much as we assume he would like to. Age is the obvious subtext – Tom Cruise is 56, only a few years younger than Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett, playing his two bosses, both unthinkable as field agents. His gravity-defying refusal to hang it up is another part of the appeal of the series: it was as long ago as 2006, at the start of M:I III, that Hunt was relegated to training duties, but the slate was wiped clean after that. Like other possible replacements before him, Jeremy Renner does not return as Brandt. For all that continuity is generally ignored, however, there is plenty of repetition. The bad guys in this one have exactly the same motivation as the bad guys in Ghost Protocol – nuclear war as purgative, making way for something better – and this is at least the third time that Hunt has been framed as a mole. One tends to go along with the idea that the plot is only there to deliver the next set piece, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie was once responsible for The Usual Suspects, one of the best-constructed screenplays of the 1990s, and proof that plots can be marvellous too. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 31, 2018"," Like a spy with many masks, the Mission: Impossible series, for a while, redefined itself with each adventure. It started with Brian De Palma’s cerebral tale of spying and deception, before flipping tone to the cartoonish gun porn of John Woo. A flashy but insubstantial instalment from JJ Abrams and the high-tech gadgetry of Brad Bird followed. But after 2015’s Rogue Nation, from writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, was praised as the best mission to date, we now have the first M:I movie to see a director return for a second go. Two years after Rogue Nation, the terrorist Syndicate has re-emerged in the form of splinter faction the Apostles, with a motive along the lines of ‘let’s kill a lot of people’ and a plan to set off some large bombs. When an attempt at keeping plutonium out of the wrong hands goes awry, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team set off on a globe-hopping adventure which takes them to Paris, London and Kashmir, and back into conflict with now-imprisoned Syndicate leader Solomon Lane (Harris). Alongside his usual support unit of Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, Hunt’s joined by CIA assassin August Walker (Cavill, plus now-notorious moustache), though Walker distrusts Hunt and has objectives of his own, as does MI6’s magnificently named Ilsa Faust (Ferguson), returning from Rogue Nation. Those who skipped the previous film may be briefly confused by those throwbacks; Fallout does one major thing the M:I series hasn’t done before, in that it’s a full-on sequel. There’s also a guest appearance from Ethan’s ex-wife (Monaghan, last seen in 2011’s Ghost Protocol) and a new character related to Vanessa Redgrave’s villain from the very first movie. Swot up with some Wikipedia plot summary-centred revision beforehand, and this can be very rewarding. The series has settled into a solid continuity rather than having Hunt throw away women and friends after just one fling, and Fallout manages not to make these returnees feel crowbarred in but to properly develop all concerned. But what we’re all here for, let’s admit it, is the grandstanding set pieces, another aspect in which Fallout ups the game. If you’ve seen the much-trailered shot of Hunt clinging onto a cargo rope beneath a helicopter, that’s just the start of a sequence that gets more brilliantly ludicrous as it goes on – wait till you see what happens when the other chopper gets involved. Other highlights include a brutal road chase through Paris and a punch-up in a nightclub toilet which is weirdly clean until Hunt’s finished with it. This balls-through-the-wall action is countered nicely by the cleverer, more deception-based espionage – there’s a great “oh, that’s what they were doing” moment when Hunt’s team get the upper hand on a villain – meaning that the two-and-a-half hour running time actually flies by. And among all this, there’s a thematic thread about Hunt’s devotion to protecting innocent lives, whatever the cost. It’s slight, but that’s kind of the point – this is a series that refuses to be too introspective, and the character development is there to add a bit of depth to the action rather than detract from it. The Daniel Craig Bond movies may have taken Bond from rookie double-O to old-timer whinging about his knobbly knees in just three films, but twenty-two years in, Ethan Hunt shows little sign of ever slowing down. If there’s one word that sums up Fallout, it’s ‘confident’. It has no desire to do anything new or polemical, but it gives us fans what we want – Tom Cruise hanging off of things, the team back together, quick-witted deception antics, and a heavy dose of charm.

"Jul 31, 2018"," With the Resident Evil saga apparently complete and no further Mad Max adventures on the immediate horizon, Mission: Impossible must qualify as the best Hollywood action series now going. Six films in, we don't know much about Ethan Hunt, the dashing super spy played by Tom Cruise. But then we don't know much about Cruise, either. There he is in his mid 50s, still inscrutably ""boyish"", still enthralled by the dream of his own magnetism, still willing to take on any challenge as long as it involves a lot of running. Cruise can fascinate in many contexts, but it's clear he thinks of himself as a physical performer above all, and  his insistence on doing his own stunts isn't an incidental vanity but the essence of the thing. Why bother with action movies if you don't personally get to jump onto a helicopter or claw your way up the side of a cliff? Such physical commitment is an undervalued component of screen acting in general, at least when it occurs outside of heavy drama. Cruise will never win an Oscar for playing Hunt, but what he does in Mission: Impossible - Fallout is surely at least as taxing as, say, Leonardo DiCaprio's role in The Revenant, with the added obligation of making it look like fun. The Mission: Impossible formula balances Cruise's circus daredevilry with the use of digital effects, especially when characters tear off Scooby Doo masks to reveal they were really someone else all along. This magic trick fits with the skill set of series overseer Christopher McQuarrie, whose knack for plot twists has been evident ever since he made his name in the 1990s as the screenwriter of The Usual Suspects. Fallout dispatches Hunt, the show pony of the globetrotting Impossible Mission Force, on a race against time to recover a stolen batch of plutonium. Ving Rhames​ returns as the team's sturdy taskmaster Luther, and Simon Pegg​ as the voice of reason Benji, essentially a cardboard cutout wearing a sign that says ""comedy sidekick"". Others in the support staff include Sean Harris as an intellectual villain railing from captivity, Angela Bassett as a CIA chief making asides about waterboarding, Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan striving to give credibility to the concept of Hunt as a lover, and Vanessa Kirby as a not very fatale femme fatale whose duplicity is played mostly for laughs. As a new team member with an advanced diploma in thuggery, Henry Cavill​ stands around giving Cruise amused, almost flirtatious glances, wearing an absurd moustache seemingly assigned to prevent anyone judging him the better-looking of the two. Disappointingly, Fallout breaks the Mission: Impossible tradition of having a different director tackle each instalment. But it's no mystery why McQuarrie is back, since his approach plays to Cruise's strengths: his idea of a good action sequence involves abrupt shifts of rhythm and constructing chains of events that aim for maximum unlikelihood without actually breaking the laws of physics. The best of these has Hunt racing over the rooftops of London, fearlessly following the instructions he receives from Luther, who plots the course from afar while failing to realise his operative is not positioned at ground level. It's a scenario that Cruise's pal Ben Stiller could have exploited for slapstick, with results that would be different but not entirely: Hunt resembles not only an avatar in a video game, but an actor willing to accept without question any direction he is given. When Hunt is, as usual, ""cut loose"" from his puppet-masters, McQuarrie seems to think he has an opportunity to delve into the character's morally ambiguous side. Cruise being Cruise, this doesn't come to much. Still, folded into his assurance is a degree of vulnerability, allowing Hunt glimmers of recognition that even he might have his limits. Scenes where Hunt attempts to make sense of Fallout's plot incorporate many variants on his patented three-point turn: a beat of hesitation, a grin of disbelief at having momentarily lost his cool, then a look around for confirmation he's not the only one in the dark. ""If even I don't get it,"" the whole display says, ""then it must be pretty damn confusing.""",NEUTRAL

"Jul 31, 2018"," “Julia Roberts not smiling is like Tom Cruise meditating,” cracked the legendary Pauline Kael in one of her more gleefully nasty bon mots. And though I admire both of those actors far more than Kael ever did, the quip crossed my mind somewhere around the second time Cruise’s Ethan Hunt snapped awake from a nightmare during Christopher McQuarrie’s impressive, if unnecessarily laborious Mission: Impossible – Fallout. I’ve enjoyed watching this beautifully performed cipher of a character pull off absurd stunts for the past twenty-two years, but I’m not exactly invested in Ethan’s dreams. According to a dear colleague of mine, “this is the first Mission: Impossible that makes it feel like the other movies have consequences,” which probably explains why I wasn’t all that crazy about it. Cruise’s grand franchise began as a director’s showcase, where the superstar producer allowed looney tune talents like Brian De Palma and John Woo to run wild with his patented persona and the remnants of a barely-remembered television program. (De Palma’s cool, clammy first film killed off the whole crew and spun the show’s hero, Jim Phelps, into the villain. It was a move akin to Captain Kirk murdering everyone on the U.S.S. Enterprise and unthinkable today in a creative climate where artists are obligated to indulge and genuflect before the dull wishes of pathetic “fans” at conventions.) The fun thing about these Mission: Impossible movies was that they all had different directors and blessedly little to do with one another. We could just check in every few years or so to see what sort of ridiculous shit Tom Cruise found to dangle himself from this time, without worrying about world-building or serialized storytelling. (You could even pretend, like I do, that J.J. Abrams’ shockingly shoddy-looking third picture never happened.) I especially enjoyed Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol and McQuarrie’s Rogue Nation because they were essentially comedies — the slapstick adventures of a Nietzschean Superman versus the laws of physics.  As the first direct sequel in the series and the first to be helmed by a returning director, Fallout is primarily concerned with the erm, fallout from Rogue Nation, which from a story standpoint probably isn’t such a hot idea considering how I’ve seen that picture six or seven times and I’m still a little iffy on particulars of the plot.  Anyhow, there’s a deflatingly lame early standoff during which Ethan loses track of three plutonium globes while trying to rescue his team. (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames are back, but Jeremy Renner must be taking a gap year from his franchises as he’s AWOL like in Infinity War.) The rest of the movie sticks Ethan and company under the supervision of Henry Cavill’s surly, magisterially mustachioed CIA agent, running and jumping and punching their way around all sorts of exotic locales trying to get their nuclear balls back. More than any other installment, Fallout is interested in what makes Ethan run. His psychology remains a subject of precious little interest to me, despite the return of Rebecca Ferguson’s mysterious Ilsa, who in Rogue Nation elicited a spark from Cruise that he seldom shares with actresses. Alas, she’s overshadowed here by the smoldering sexual tension between Cruise and Cavill, something McQuarrie slyly kids by setting their first fight scene inside a Eurotrash disco men’s room. This knock-down, drag-out bout is probably the movie’s best set-piece, the grace with which Cavill sheds his sport jacket and cocks his arms like shotguns providing the most iconic moment in a movie strangely short on them. The other action sequences are breathtaking on the level of execution, if not inspiration. Cruise’s face is so clearly visible during the most insane stunts a friend of mine spent the entire movie muttering in awe, “Do you believe this fuckin’ guy?” There’s nobody who works harder to entertain you than Tom Cruise, and he’s gonna make sure every bit of that exertion is up there on the screen. You can’t not appreciate the effort, long may he run. Yet this all makes me feel like a bit of a spoilsport for pointing out the movie is lacking any single image as indelible as its star hanging from the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol’s centerpiece sequence or from the side of that airbus in Rogue Nation’s can-you-top-this opening. (There’s also nothing nearly as left-field funny as the way he got out of that plane.) The film’s final set-piece features callbacks to all the other installments, in keeping with a valedictory emphasis on continuity that includes Vanessa Kirby playing the granddaughter of Vanessa Redgrave’s character from the first film and the return of Michelle Monaghan, who played Cruise’s wife in the third. As has become fashionable in franchise films, Ethan Hunt is weighed down by his history like 007 in Skyfall and Spectre. I also felt a distinctly Nolan-esque ponderousness creeping into the proceedings, with Lorne Balfe’s Hans Zimmer-knockoff score forsaking Lalo Schifrin bongos for Dark Knight droning. At two-and-a-half hours Fallout is a good deal heavier and more imposing than it needed to be, missing the two previous pictures’ sense of play. (These aren’t the kind of films that should be killing off funny characters.) Gone is the tongue-in-cheek glory of Alec Baldwin referring to Hunt as “the living manifestation of destiny,” replaced here by more earnest and pedestrian testimonials, delivered with a frequency suggesting the star-producer may not actually be in on the joke. Sigh, but if only every disappointing genre picture existed on such an impeccable level of craft! In many respects Mission: Impossible – Fallout is what I wish every ordinary action movie would strive to be. I just wish this one wasn’t striving to be such an ordinary action movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2018"," Tom Cruise may be 56 and not look entirely like Tom Cruise any more – don’t worry, Tom, I’m sure it’s just a trick of the lighting – but he can still churn out a cracking action-thriller, as the latest instalment from the apparently endless Mission: Impossible franchise (now 22 years and six films old) shows.  With three spectacular chase sequences – the best and funniest of which takes place in London – and some top-notch female casting, it’s the best Mission: Impossible film since… well, since the last one, because that was very good too. The masterstroke, however, is the belated introduction of some continuity to the series, each instalment of which has hitherto stood pretty much alone. Not only is Mission: Impossible – Fallout effectively a sequel to 2015’s Rogue Nation, but a key character, last seen in 2011, makes an emotional return to leaven the inevitable crash, bang, wallop and increasing silliness of the genuinely cliff-hanging finale. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie, who also made Rogue Nation and Jack Reacher with Cruise, has clearly established a good working relationship with the Hollywood star, who seems to be taking himself just a little less seriously these days. It’s important not to take the plot of these things too seriously either, what with three missing spheres of weapons-grade plutonium, a shadowy group known as Apostles, the even shadowier figure of ‘John Lark’, and a woman known as the ‘White Widow’. Only Ethan Hunt (Cruise), head of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), feels at home in this sort of company.  The action is as peripatetic as ever, beginning in Berlin, where Ethan, Benji (the much improved Simon Pegg) and franchise original Luther (Ving Rhames) manage to lose the plutonium spheres, apparently because Ethan has never considered the famous philosophical dilemma: is it better to sacrifice one life if, in so doing, you save the lives of thousands of others? I’d have thought that was basic international spy stuff. But put on the bullet-splattered spot, Ethan gets the answer wrong, which means he and the team can spend the next two-and-a-quarter hours trying to get them back and generally whizzing around Paris, London and somewhere mountainous on the India/China border. Working out who the baddies and goodies are, however, has rarely been harder. Hunt, it turns out, might just be a baddie; Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), hitherto the IMF’s political nemesis, seems to have become a goodie; and as for the CIA, surely goodies to the core? Well, I don’t trust either head honcho Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) or the big muscly agent (Henry Cavill) she’s insisted comes along to keep the IMF in check. As for Ilsa Faust (the excellent Rebecca Ferguson), the double agent who returns after Rogue Nation and who, in less enlightened times, I once described as ‘the best spy-candy since Eva Green in Casino Royale’, she changes sides more often than Benji changes facial prosthetics. But there’s no mistaking the terrorist and anarchist Solomon Lane, so splendidly played by Sean Harris. He was a villainous baddie in Rogue Nation and he stays a villainous baddie, albeit now in custody, in Fallout. Vanessa Kirby makes an electrifying genre debut as the White Widow, managing to convey in just a few sizzling scenes that she is mad, bad and definitely dangerous to know. Yes, I know it slightly spoils things that she’s got the hots for a character played by an actor (Cruise) a mere 26 years her senior, but these things change slowly in Hollywood. At times, McQuarrie’s plot does get a bit bogged down in the fine detail, but there’s so much to fit in. Rhames, who, along with Cruise is the only survivor from the 1996 original, is rewarded with more to do, a major character bows out and, of course, there’s that emotional return of a familiar face. But it’s the action sequences that franchise fans treasure. A motorbike chase in Paris seems to go on for ever; a rooftop London pursuit (in which Cruise broke an ankle – and, yes, that distinctly painful-looking footage is used) is both terrific and funny; and as for the helicopter chase in the foothills of the Himalayas, it’s got to be the best cinematic cliffhanger since… well, Cliffhanger in 1993. Enjoy!  The Hotel Transylvania franchise has the sort of voice cast that other animated children’s films can only dream of – Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Mel Brooks, Steve Buscemi and, for the latest in the series, Kathryn Hahn – and yet it’s such a difficult franchise to warm to. I found Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation (U) ★★ loud, charmless and not very funny, although the first two films took more than $800 million at the global box office, so it’s clear not everyone agrees. It’s easy to blame the problem on the central voice performance of Sandler as Dracula, who after centuries of evading assorted Van Helsings now runs a hotel in Transylvania and, as the new film begins, is very much in need of a holiday himself. The character Sandler creates, however, is not someone you want to spend a lot of time with, and isn’t a patch on that other great mittel-European voice performance of recent cartoon years – Steve Carell’s Gru in the wonderful Despicable Me series. But there’s another problem too, which is the essential wooliness of the basic idea. A hotel for vampires has a certain logic, and a hotel where other horror-film characters are also welcome (Frankenstein, The Mummy and Vlad the Impaler all feature) might work too. But a hotel where all of the above are joined by a colourful but apparently random selection of spiky/blobby/tentacled monsters plucked from a child’s imagination just seems a bit lazy. It’s as if someone once told director and co-writer Genndy Tartakovsky that if he just makes it ‘zany’ it will work. But that’s not true – too zany and things simply become annoying. Which is what happens here as Dracula, daughter Mavis (Gomez), son-in-law Johnny (Andy Samberg) and the rest of the Drac-pack depart on a monster cruise. The only thing I really warmed to was the visual depiction of the Bermuda Triangle, a vast three-sided hole in the ocean piled high with rusty shipwrecks. Everything else? Disappointing pretty much covers it. The sick young patient in need of the blood transfusion that will save their life – only for it to be revealed that they have been brought up as a Jehovah’s Witness and cannot be given blood – has become something of a staple of television medical dramas such as Casualty. In Daniel Kokotajlo’s debut feature, Apostasy, however, this dreadful scenario gets a more thorough examination, resulting in a British drama that, while undeniably slow and bleakly awkward, is also as interesting as it is disturbing. It also features three knockout performances from the actresses at the centre of events – the superb Siobhan Finneran, who plays the God-fearing and unbending matriarch Ivanna; Molly Wright (so good in TV’s The A Word) as Alex, who received blood as a baby and is therefore considered somehow tainted; and Sacha Parkinson, playing the elder sister whose illegitimate pregnancy will shake the family faith to its core.",POSITIVE

"Jul 30, 2018"," There’s little new or fresh in the latest “Mission: Impossible” chapter, branded way too ominously  for its own good with the term “Fallout” (“Mission: Impossible – Fallout”). Its star, Tom Cruise, isn’t the spry chicken he was in “Risky Business” back in 1982; the television series the film franchise hangs on was a droll, thinking person’s staple back in the 1960s and 1970s; and the stunt work here is mostly old school. These aren’t three strikes, but a gold strike: Blending the three makes for the most exhilarating filmgoing experience of the summer, with Cruise doing most of his own stunts for the painstaking realism – and boy, does it show – and director Christopher McQuarrie choosing to do each crash-bang chase they way they used to when Bill Friedkin was lighting up the screen, eschewing CGI where any “Fast and Furious” helmer would jump in with a dual core processor and a green screen. The plot’s not all that much to bite into – there’s three mobile nukes on the loose in Europe and IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise)  feels particularly responsible because he let the weapons out of his grasp by opting to save one of his own crew (Ving Rhames). Because of said misstep, Hunt’s team is given a watchful CIA presence, a strong-jawed slab by the name of Walker (Henry Cavill, who dons the cape as Superman in a different franchise). In Paris and London there’s a sleek assassin on a motorbike (Rebecca Ferguson) tailing Hunt & Co., as well as a racy arms dealer (Vanessa Kirby, from “The Crown”) in the middle who, without batting an eyelash, whips a stiletto from her garter belt to dispatch an onrushing hitman. Oh yeah, Lane (Sean Harris), the anarchist terrier Hunt put away in his last outing, “Rogue Nation,” factors big into the mix as well. Needless to say, it’s a crowded affair that reaches its crescendo atop sheer precipices in Kashmir, and while that copter-crashing cliffhanger works effectively – if you hate height like me, you may experience a few churns to the gut – it’s not as raw or adrenaline-pumping as Hunt running the rooftops in London to capture quarry, or the smackdown in a Paris men’s room where Hunt and Walker get their asses handed to them by a very able foe. The scenes are so invigorating that when they’re over you need to catch your breath. The film does too, and it’s in these moments that the lines of artifice to get to the next whopper of a stunt show some. You can tell Cruise and McQuarrie, the scribe behind “The Usual Suspects” who’s worked with Cruise on nearly a half-dozen projects, are on the same page – it shows in almost every scene. McQuarrie, an obvious cinephile, layers in a slew of subtle, tongue-in-cheek film references for the enlightened, be it a nod to Rhames’ gimp scene in “Pulp Fiction” or Hunt spouting Cruise’s “crystal” line from “A Few Good Men.” And boy, can he run – and drive, fly and fall. Instead of “Fallout,” the tag for the film should have been “See Tom Run.” Tom Meek is a writer living in Cambridge.

"Jul 30, 2018",It is rare that a movie leaves me so giddy and dumbstruck by the intricacies of its production,POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2018"," 
  WOW. In an age of computer generated imagery, where technology makes anything possible on screen, it would seem truly Mission: Impossible to rouse such a reaction from a jaded reviewer.
 
  Yet Tom Cruise does precisely that in Fallout via the simple means of hurling CGI off the nearest cliff and going back to action movie basics. If there is any dangling from helicopters to be done, tall buildings to leap between, or planes to jump from, the now 56-year-old does it himself. When it comes to movie bangs for your buck, Cruise, bless his crazy cotton socks, delivers an atom bomb’s worth of thrills.
 
  This is the sixth Mission: Impossible with Cruise as special agent Ethan Hunt. The reboot of the Sixties television show leaves enough of a gap between pictures to make each instalment something of an event, a rare trick in this sequel-packed age. That is one reason for M:I’s success. Another, aside from the stunts, is that it keeps things simple. Hunt is given a mission, which he always accepts, to right a terrible wrong. Let the mayhem commence.
 
  This time round, a band of terrorists are trying to get hold of nuclear weapons to start a global war. Hunt, with trusty sidekicks Luther and Benji (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) is on the case, but a rendezvous with an arms dealers goes awry.
 
  CIA chief Erica Sloan (the ever wonderful Angela Bassett) accuses the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) of being a “Halloween” joke of an outfit, complete with masks. To make sure they do not mess up again, she sends her own agent, August Walker (Henry “Superman” Cavill), on the mission with Hunt. A star needs a pretty robust sense of his own worth to line up against an actor who is younger, and let’s face it taller, than he is, but Cruise seems to treat this as just another dare.
 
  Their first daredevil act together is jumping out of a plane from a height so far above the clouds they need oxygen. Spectacular as this parachute drop into Paris is, the film is only just getting started. Among the sequences to follow is a fight between Hunt, Walker and an assailant in what has to be the world’s cleanest nightclub toilet. There are some things even Cruise will not put himself through for a film; being hurled around some lavvy with Trainspotting standards of hygiene is one of them.
 
  Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, helmer of the last M:I, handles the rest of the tale as if to the franchise born. There are lot of parts to slot into place, including the buddy stuff between Hunt and his crew, with Pegg happy to provide the comic relief once more as the team wimp (even if he now has a Hollywood-honed body of his own these days); some romantic interludes; and a spot of spy shenanigans. It is all present and correctly done, with some nice touches of sly humour. Everything, though, must take a back seat to the USP of M:I – the stunts. Any movie can be a secret service caper, but not many, with the exception of the later Bournes, throw themselves into the job with the kind of intensity on display here. From city to city, on motorbikes, in helicopters, up in the air, across the rooftops, Cruise keeps it as real as possible, to adrenaline-pumping effect.
 
  Strange to say, but there is almost too much of this good thing. I would have been happy to say cheerio and thanks for all the thrills after the third or fourth stunt and the upteenth plot twist, but still they kept coming, right up until the end of the two and a half hour mark. Pack sandwiches and set bladders to brace.
 
  Hamill acquits himself well as a counterbalance to Cruise, while Rebecca Ferguson, playing Ilsa Faust, makes a welcome return as an agent who can give as good as she gets. It is Cruise, though, old Top Gun himself, who is at the centre of the M:I world. On the strength of this blistering outing, it looks like he will be defying age, and the odds, for a while yet.

"Jul 30, 2018"," Una vez más, el mundo está bajo una amenaza terrorista, y el equipo de Misión Imposible tendrá que encontrar un plutonio robado para evitar una terrible catástrofe. Estamos ubicados justo después del episodio anterior. Siempre se habla de la Unión en el contexto de la lealtad y la disolución del equipo de IMF (Impossible Mision Force). Nuevamente encontramos a la misteriosa mujer interpretada por Rebecca Ferguson, la actriz sueca que una vez más le da a un encanto muy ambiguo a Ilsa Faust, quien a menudo está en el camino de Ethan; así como al antagonista de la película anterior, Solomon Lane, a quien Sean Harris le da una cara inquietante, incluso aterradora. Agreguemos un recién llegado, Henry Cavill, como August Walker, con quien la CIA obliga a Ethan a trabajar, teniendo un interesante y complejo rol en la trama. Hace más de cincuenta años, que dicha serie del mismo nombre debutó en televisión, inaugurando un concepto que abarcó siete temporadas. La idea y estilo de la serie se mantenían vigentes gracias al pegajoso ritmo de inicio y el eterno romance del público con lo relativo al espionaje, es por eso que 1996 debuta en las salas su primera versión cinematográfica de la mano de Tom Cruise. Varios realizadores se sentarían detrás de la silla del director, como Brian de Palma (1996), John Woo (2000), J. J. Abrams (2006), Brad Bird (2011) y, finalmente, Christopher McQuarrie. Desde el lanzamiento de la saga de Misión Imposible en la gran pantalla, esta es la primera vez que pasa dos veces al mismo director detrás de la cámara para organizar a Ethan Hunt y su equipo. Hasta ahora, Tom Cruise había sido contratado para seleccionar cineastas con estilos marcados y personalidades fuertes para imbuir a cada obra con una atmósfera diferente. Sin embargo, McQuarrie no busca la repetición, y redobla esfuerzos para que Fallout no se vea como Rogue Nation. Él presiona el paso para prescindir de los servicios de su compositor favorito Joe Kramer, dejando a Lorne Balfe a cargo de la banda sonora. Dos protagonistas han estado presentes a lo largo de la franquicia: Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) y Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). Esto en realidad es lo que marca al espectador en el universo Misión Imposible y le da identidad a la película. A partir de ahí, escribir que el resto de los actores importan poco, sería un paso que no me atrevo a mencionar, pero la presencia de Tom Cruise es el símbolo más importante en la saga y se puede decir que evoluciona en sabiduría e inteligencia con cada episodio, amén de sus excelentes habilidades físicas que muchos envidiarían a su edad. Esta sexta misión imposible obviamente busca cultivar una oscuridad y una sensación de tragedia heredada del Batman de Christopher Nolan. Los constantes dilemas de Ethan nos llevan de vuelta a la famosa secuencia de los dos transbordadores en The Dark Knight. ¿Deberíamos pensar en el interés general antes que el de un grupo menor? ¿Deberíamos aceptar sacrificar algunas vidas para salvar a otros? Este motivo aparece desde el principio, durante el cual Hunt, Benji y Luther fallan miserablemente en su misión. Pronto este sentir contamina a toda la película hasta que se convierte en su principal fuerza impulsora. Cada escena de acción se basa en este tema que se repite, hasta un final vertiginoso de carácter casi sobrenatural, con una especie de súper héroe tomando su papel de ángel de la guarda muy en serio, y cuyos super-poderes serían no solo determinación sino también una loca imprudencia al borde de la inconsciencia. El abismo inherente a la entrega de Tom Cruise se ejecuta a toda velocidad. Sabiendo que el actor en realidad realiza una gran parte de las acrobacias, la participación del espectador sigue siendo un punto muy fuerte. En la era de la magia digital, es casi un milagro alcanzar la adrenalina del público como en los días de los primeros  James Bond. Como tal, las innumerables secuencias de Misión Imposible: Fallout superan la audacia de la gran mayoría de las películas de acción de los últimos diez o veinte años. La extraordinaria persecución en auto en medio del tráfico parisino, emula a la inigualable “The French Conection” de William Friedkin, por no mencionar el combate cuerpo a cuerpo extremadamente brutal, la carrera en la azotea, las increíbles caídas libres o una genial persecución en helicóptero que redefinió solo el significado de la palabra ""clímax"". Sin duda, es lamentable que esta ambición en realidad no se refleje en el guión, que a menudo se mueve de situaciones rápidas, intercala secuencias dramáticas que cortan el ritmo, o presenta a personajes que claramente sabíamos el giro que agregarían, sumándole algunos instantes en la banda sonora que utiliza piezas agiles en momentos de diálogos importantes para la continuidad de una escena. Con esta nueva entrega, Christopher McQuarrie empuja el vicio un poco más allá y tiene éxito en su apuesta al embarcarnos en una película extremadamente divertida. El elenco siempre está en su tope y es lo más atractivo, revelando una faceta nueva en Henry Cavill. Misión: Imposible – Fallout debería ser el modelo a seguir de la subsiguientes propuestas de verano. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Jul 30, 2018"," Se estrena ahora la sexta película de la saga de Misión imposible (2018), con el subtítulo innecesario de Repercusión, donde repite el director Christopher McQuarrie, cuyos alardes narrativos pasan por lo que él bien maneja: la espectacularidad visual. Ello nos obliga a ejercer la llamada suspensión de la incredulidad, esto es, a dar por creíble todo los que vemos en pantalla, por más ilógico o irreal que nos parezca: no nos podemos andar con dudas. Ya lo decía Aristóteles: “Más vale un imposible verosímil antes que un posible inverosímil”. Esta frase debe tenerla usted en la cabeza ante la película que ahora les comento y trato de que les sea disfrutable. Lo mejor de esta sexta aventura de Ethan Hunt, el héroe del caso, es que busca redondear distintos aspectos que vienen de otras películas de la saga, sobre todo de la anterior. Por eso, después de tanto barullo, persecuciones, balaceras, peleas, “truénganos” y “fusínganos”, se diseña mejor la personalidad del señor Hunt. El proceso del personaje está marcado por el de sus adrenalínicas aventuras. El filme no parte del diseño del personaje, sino que camina hacia ese diseño: es un viaje cargado de aventuras explosivas para conocer mejor al héroe, pero al final de la película. Como el director Christopher McQuarrie es coguionista con Bruce Geller, mérito se le ha de dar en esa propuesta de Misión imposible: Repercusión. Incluso, se retoma la indefinición de si Ethan Hunt persigue o es perseguido, si es héroe o antihéroe, en fin, concepto que manejó muy bien el director Brian de Palma en la versión de 1996. Como realizador, el problema con Christopher McQuarrie es que tiene dificultades para empalmar las partes entre sí (conformar el todo), por lo que el filme disfraza de complejo lo que solo es complicado en términos narrativos. Es un problema de articulación que no se corrigió en la sala de montaje. En lo que va de esta saga, prefiero la esencia que del cine de acción manejó el director Brad Bird en el cuarto filme, porque mantiene un sugerente sentido de la estética que se pierde en esta ocasión. Ya lo sabemos, el señor Bird prefirió irse a realizar el filme animado Los increíbles 2. Las actuaciones están más descuidadas esta vez: Tom Cruise se preocupa más por sus acrobacias sin doble alguno y descuida el sentido dramático de su personaje. Por otro lado, el secundario Henry Cavill solo atina a manejar dos registros igualmente rígidos: el de malo que finge ser bueno y el de malo que realmente lo es. La música es fundamental. Es como como si tanta y tanta acción corriese por el pentagrama compuesto por Lorne Balfe, sin olvidarse del tema principal que se le debe al argentino Lalo Schifrin desde que esta saga comenzó en 1966 para la televisión.

"Jul 30, 2018"," In his 1846 essay “The Present Age,” Søren Kierkegaard decried the widespread tendency of the time—which he summed up as an age “without passion”—to “transform daring and enthusiasm into a feat of skill.” I’m not sure that these observations apply to the modern public at large, but they certainly account in significant measure for the peculiar critical acclaim that “Mission: Impossible—Fallout,” written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, has been garnering. The film—the sixth in the “Mission: Impossible” series—is intelligently made, but its display of intelligence is an equivocal virtue. Its feat of cinematic engineering invites admiration for its engineering: the infrastructure is on the outside, the seemingly tenuous threads that dangle its dramatic pendants are on view, and the delights that it offers are those of a production video, showcased not in a behind-the-scenes reel but throughout the movie itself. While viewers are having their sensibilities dunned and stunned by infotainment tales of this movie’s “feat of skill,” the critical community rushes to search for continuity between its cinematic spectacle and the classical era of filmmaking. The widely ballyhooed details of Tom Cruise’s  readiness to perform his own dangerous and difficult stunts conjures, to the public, a sense of satisfaction regarding the pains that a fabulously rich and famous person is willing to take for their pleasures; for critics, it evokes an age of artistic heroism harking back to Buster Keaton’s and Harold Lloyd’s self-sacrificing stunts. But the knowledge that Cruise takes the risk of doing his own stunts is insignificant from a cinematic perspective unless he’s filmed in a way that emphasizes his physical commitment—and the production’s dependence on his physical commitment. Instead, there’s little in “Mission: Impossible—Fallout” to suggest that Cruise wasn’t mashed up via C.G.I. with stunt performers onto whose physiques his face and voice were superimposed. To complete the sense of a nostalgia trip for tradition-hungry critics, the movie was shot on 35-mm. film, not digital video. This, too, doesn’t matter at all—there’s hardly a visual sensibility detectible anywhere in the movie, not an image with any resonance or overtone beyond the transparent conveyance of the scripted action. These action scenes aren’t intimate or precise. They are, by and large, smeary—the idea of their cumulative mechanisms, their plotting, the payoff that results, overrides any single image by which they’re realized. Yet at the same time they’re not filmed with any conspicuous cinematic impressionism or subjective fragmentation. They seem intended, rather, to deliver an illusion of thoroughness, of completeness, of spectacular exhaustiveness, that no individual image suggests on its own. There’s a great deal of tumult and thrashing in the action sequences but little sense of dynamic stillness; here, when there’s no onscreen agitation, there’s merely nothing happening. Nowhere in the movie’s gargantuan churn is there a single moment of astonishing grace to rival Cruise’s cable-dangling backflip in the first “Mission: Impossible,” directed by Brian De Palma. The intricate plot of “Mission: Impossible—Fallout” has a miniseries-like surplus of twists that are rooted in elaborate deceptions and false identities. The movie’s MacGuffin is a trio of metallic spheres, about the size of bocce balls, that contain plutonium and are adorned with gizmos to plug them catastrophically into detonators. The terroristic villains who seek it sound more like a couple of British Invasion bands—Solomon Lane and the Apostles, John Lark and the Syndicate—but there’s nothing entertaining about their intentions. With the help of a rogue nuclear scientist, they’re planning to commit mass nuclear murder—and Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his closest associates in the Impossible Missions Force, Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), stage a meeting with the plutonium-ball sellers but are ambushed. To save Luther’s life, Ethan lets the villains get away with the plutonium, and the rest of the movie’s two-and-a-half-hour span is devoted to the group’s effort to get them back or to render them inert before the evildoers can detonate them. But, along the way, Ethan comes under suspicion for having let the villains get away with the plutonium; he’s accused by the group’s civilian director (Alec Baldwin) of being in cahoots with them (or worse, being one of them). Also, the group finds itself confronting arms dealers who appear to be helping the villains acquire their nuclear weaponry, notably the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who’s also equipped with an uncertain identity and elusive allegiances. McQuarrie also injects some romantic melancholy into the plot, doing so midway through the film with a quick but telling mention of Ethan’s wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). That very mention—of a character who has been unseen throughout—threatens the glimmer of his romance with his colleague Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson); when she turns up later, she threatens to distract Ethan from his extravagant and delicate duty. Despite the deft coherence of the plot’s mirror games of alliance and betrayal, which provide the illusion of a developed drama, the movie almost totally deprives its characters of inner life or complex motives. The action sequences that are the “Mission: Impossible” movies’ raisons d’être are at their best, in “Fallout,” when they’re at their simplest—whether in a gory martial-arts-centered battle in a gleaming modern bathroom in Paris’s Grand Palais or in a presto-change-o deceit that’s cribbed from a routine in the first “Mission: Impossible” film. Those scenes, however, are the exceptions. A mighty car chase in Paris is a cold rehash of dozens of similar sequences served up through the decades (a similar scene in the soon-to-be-released comedy “The Spy Who Dumped Me” is much more original and clever); a shoot-out in the shadow of the Paris Métro doesn’t have the clarity to match its rapidity. There’s some quick wit in Ethan’s dash in London’s South Bank toward the Tate Modern, thanks to Benji’s hasty reading of a G.P.S. map, but the action soon devolves into a jumble of picturesque absurdities that exist for the sole purpose of bringing down the curtain on one act and initiating another, the final one. That concluding routine, already somehow celebrated, involving helicopters above the mountains and crags of Kashmir, is a blustering, mechanical anticlimax, in which the ending is foretold. The airborne sequence is set up by and coördinated with events on the ground, a matched set of last-moment maneuvers and escapes that leaves little surprise in its outcome. Since only a moment or two offers anything like a visceral jolt, let alone a sense of actual physical danger, the action offers the sense of viewing a shoot schedule and a work plan developing through the images onscreen. The problem with constructing a movie as one long making-of sequence is that, if it’s a movie as inert as this one, it doesn’t so much answer the question “How was it made?” as pose another one altogether: Why?

"Jul 30, 2018"," by Walter Chaw As the title flatly states, Mission: Impossible: Fallout (hereafter Fallout), the sixth instalment in our very own Jackie Chan’s signature series, will be about Ethan Hunt’s (Tom Cruise) emotional baggage, earned over twenty-plus years of saving the world from threats foreign, domestic, and auteur. The main personal casualty for Hunt is the disintegration of his marriage to Julia (Michelle Monaghan), who must remain a “ghost” so that she doesn’t suffer the, yes, fallout from Ethan’s hero work. She checks in every once in a while, Hunt’s teammate Luther (Ving Rhames) tells Ethan’s new flame, former MI6 agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). It’s what keeps Ethan going. Accordingly, Fallout starts with an apocalyptic dream of Julia in the hands of maddog terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris)–the type of dream James Cameron used so effectively in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, where everyone turns to charcoal and flies apart. It’s important to focus in on all of this because Fallout is about a very specific element of the myth of masculinity, this romanticizing of sacrifice and suffering that men must go through in order to protect the women in their lives. The best part of Martin Campbell’s extremely good Casino Royale is when fatale Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) brings Bond (Daniel Craig) back from the dead and his first sentence is spent asking if she’s okay. There’s a scene like that at the end of Fallout as well when Hunt, back from the dead, apologizes to Julia for everything. It’s the sentiment and the situation that makes men in the audience spring a manly leak. Hunt–even his name is a primordial gender assignation–is the avatar for male expectation, which casts his heroics in an odd light, I think: fantasies of male heroism played against grandiose, extravagant, paranoid delusions. I don’t know now if I’m talking about Cruise or Hunt. Same, same. 
Fallout is focused in on Ethan’s devotion to his ex-wife and to his team. Hunt decides early on to save Luther at the expense of losing three balls of plutonium, thus triggering a recovery mission in which CIA muscle Walker (Henry Cavill) tags along to make sure Ethan behaves. The nuclear threat is the MacGuffin of the piece–a particularly uninteresting one, as it happens. Good thing the action sequences, especially a close-quarters bathroom brawl with ace stuntman and martial artist Yang Liang, are so skilfully-staged. There’s something bracing, too, about the knowledge that Cruise, to the extent possible, has again performed his own stunts. You get the same charge out of Jackie Chan’s pictures during his prime; it’s just better knowing that it’s “real.” I also enjoyed the sequence where a man–Hunt’s other longstanding teammate, Benji (Simon Pegg)–is in terrible peril and the audience has been set up to root for a woman, Ilsa, to free herself in time to help him. Whatever Cruise’s personal proclivities, these last two Mission: Impossible films have been extraordinarily progressive in their treatment of women. Ilsa is a landmark character in American mainstream cinema, as progressive and interesting as Rey. This is not to absolve Cruise of anything, but to say that Ilsa is one of the best things this popular culture has ever produced, and I’m grateful to witness it. If we take that as a given, then, it makes her ultimate capitulation to Hunt’s heroics (he “frees” her from her contract) feel absolutely incongruous to the character and the film, unless it’s read as another of Hunt’s–and, by extension, our–hero projections/fantasies. The major movements of Fallout are introduced by Hunt’s nightmares. He wakes from one in the back of a truck to the curious looks of his friends and enemies. It’s a device that highlights the Impressionism of the piece: this thought that everything that happens in the picture is shifts of light and colour. Indeed, it’s very much like a Debussy to Rogue Nation‘s “Turandot” (the opera a reference to the trials a suitor must undertake in order to ‘win’ an unattainable woman), Impressionism being the representation of motion at odds with structure and narrative. A pity that Fallout still feels beholden to what are now conventions in this universe: the rubber masks and the Rube Goldberg plot, all of betrayals and counter-betrayals. I wonder what it would’ve been like as just movement, stitched together on a beat. Whenever the movie brakes, it’s boring. Whenever it’s moving, it’s nothing short of amazing. Late in the film, just before an already legendary closing sequence that deserves every single inevitable plaudit, Ilsa overhears something that Julia says and mutters, “Oh, I like her.” It made me emotional. I’m not entirely certain why that is. I think it has something to do with the conversation about male fantasies. Not the sexual sort of fantasy, but the empowerment fantasy that young men, prepubescent or right on the cusp, tend to entertain: You’re the knight errant, you brave unimaginable hardships for your lady fair, and as you lie bloodied and dying at her feet, you apologize for not doing more in response to her lamentations. I don’t know that men ever entirely outgrow the desire to be a martyr to their immortal beloveds. It’s the root of all our problems. It speaks volumes to what we are as a species that it’s also so much fun to watch it play out this way in an expertly-crafted action film. I think Ilsa’s approval of–maybe recognition of herself in–Julia hits at the kind of understanding men are looking for from the women they love and want to protect. Ilsa, who absolutely doesn’t need Ethan’s protection, in this moment acknowledges that Julia is like her in some way–that it’s possible for Ethan himself, perhaps, to be saved by a woman who doesn’t need him. There’s a Harlan Ellison story called “The Other Eye of Polyphemus” that ends with its protagonist being offered help for the first time. Fallout is about a broken man with delusions of grandeur who moves away from a woman who sees salvation in him to a woman who doesn’t. This is a good conversation to have.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2018"," (In our Spoiler Reviews, we take a deep dive into a new release and get to the heart of what makes it tick...and every story point is up for discussion. In this entry: Mission: Impossible – Fallout.)""The end you've always feared is coming,"" the villainous Solomon Lane tells Ethan Hunt halfway through Mission: Impossible – Fallout. ""The fallout of all your good intentions."" If the Mission: Impossible franchise has one specific problem, it's this: it took a very long time to tell us who Ethan Hunt was. From the beginning, Hunt, as played by Tom Cruise, was a bit of a cipher.Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation changed that. The previous entry in the Mission franchise took a step back and finally asked, ""Who is Ethan Hunt?"" The answer: he's kind of a crazy jerk. Someone who will risk everyone's life just to come out ahead. This was a fascinating development in Ethan's character trajectory, but perhaps director Christopher McQuarrie – who is the first Mission franchise filmmaker to return for a second time – realized it was a bit too much. That the series couldn't realistically continue if Ethan Hunt remained a borderline sociopath.Which brings us to Fallout, the most breathless, exciting, action-packed installment in the series yet. I don't know if I'm quite ready to call it the best entry in the series – Rogue Nation still holds that distinction, as of now – but I am ready to declare Fallout to be the most thrilling Mission. A film so relentlessly entertaining that it might actually exhaust you. Believe the hype: this really is the best action movie since Mad Max: Fury Road. Beyond the big, jaw-dropping action set pieces, Fallout does something very interesting: it rehabilitates Ethan Hunt. It takes steps back from the brink of his Rogue Nation character description, and goes down another path. Here is a film that finally tells us who Ethan Hunt is: he's someone willing to make a potentially bad choice to help the people he cares about. As IMF Chairman Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) says, Hunt is the type of spy who isn't willing to sacrifice one life to save thousands (or more). He's not a big picture person. He's focused on the smaller picture. Because in Hunt's view, saving one life is the same exact thing as saving thousands.It can get a bit heavy-handed. There are several scenes in Fallout where characters stop and give speeches about what a great guy Ethan Hunt is. It works in the context of the film, but one can't help realize it's all a bit self-serving. Because when you boil it down, Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt. They're one in the same. And if everyone in the movie is giving speeches about what a swell fellow Ethan Hunt is, it's tantamount to the same characters singing the praises of Cruise – who produces this franchise.But can you blame them? Cruise is one of the last genuine movie stars, and the Mission franchise has given him the opportunity to seriously rehabilitate his image. Around the time of the release of War of the Worlds, Cruise's persona (and career) took a nosedive, due to some very questionable public appearances. Ever since then, he's been climbing his way back to the top, one dangerous stunt at a time. Through this series, Cruise has become both actor and stuntman, constantly putting his life in danger for the sake of entertainment. On one hand, it makes for good press – we all want to talk about how entertaining it is to watch Cruise risk certain death for the sake of an action movie. On the other hand, it really is genuinely thrilling. We're rightfully amazed as we watch Cruise leap from planes, or jump between buildings, or dangle from helicopters. All of this stuff could easily be faked with greenscreens and digital trickery. But it's really happening, and Cruise is really doing it, and gosh darn it, that's exciting.Fallout is the first Mission: Impossible film to serve as a direct sequel. And not just to Rogue Nation, either. Sure, all the Mission films exist within the same universe, but up until now, they've all been stand-alone stories. Fallout takes a much different approach. It's an explicit follow-up to the events in Rogue Nation, but more than that, it's a film that references the series as a whole. It's almost as if McQuarrie and Cruise are rewarding the franchise's fans. They're saying ""Thank you"" to everyone who stuck around for six movies, and proving that it was all worth it.Remember arms-dealer Max, from Mission: Impossible? Well, her daughter – who has the super cool nickname the White Widow – is in this film, played by Vanessa Kirby. Remember when Ethan Hunt did some rock climbing in Mission: Impossible 2? He gets to do that again here too. Ethan got hitched to very nice nurse Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan) in Mission: Impossible III, and ever since then, the franchise has been trying to figure out what to do about that. Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol featured a fake-out where the audience was made to believe Julia had been killed, only to have her show up at the end. Rogue Nation didn't mention her at all. Here, McQuarrie's script finally gives Julia her due, and directly involves her in the film's big climax.At the end of Rogue Nation, Ethan Hunt and his team had seemingly foiled the Syndicate, a rogue organization comprised of secret agents from all over the world, fronted by unpleasant weirdo Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Unlike other Mission baddies before, Lane survived the events of Rogue Nation, and ended up in custody. Now, Ethan Hunt is starting to think that might've been a mistake. His haunted by nightmares of Lane, and while the Syndicate has been wounded, it's not dead yet.The remaining members of the Syndicate are now calling themselves the Apostles, and they want to get their hands on some plutonium cores to build nuclear weapons. The Apostles don't just want to set off some bombs, though. They have a diabolical plan to throw the entire world into anarchy and chaos, with what they believe to be a noble goal. The Apostles believe that if everything is chaos, world powers will have no choice but to work together to fix things. It's pretty much the same exact plan that Ozymandias has in Watchmen, minus the giant fake squid-alien. At Fallout's start, Ethan's commitment to caring about one life instead of thousands backfires. While posing as plutonium buyers, Hunt and his team – Ving Rhames as the ever-present Luther Stickell, and Simon Pegg as the nervous Benji Dunn – get made. Luther's life is in danger, and Ethan could just let Luther die in order to keep the plutonium safe and prevent possible nuclear annihilation. Instead, Ethan shoots Luther – who happens to be wearing a bulletproof vest. In the ensuing chaos, the Apostles make-off with the plutonium, and the IMF is once again under some heavy scrutiny from Washington (how this agency, which has been disavowed several times and is constantly being called out for recklessness, continues to operate is one of the film's biggest suspension-of-disbelief elements).Ethan is committed to tracking the plutonium down and stopping the Apostles. How? ""We'll think of something,"" he says – a line that becomes Hunt's mantra in the film. He repeats it several times when pressed for an answer as to how he's going to solve a big problem.This answer isn't good enough for CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), who orders one of her agents – the very handsome, very mustachioed August Walker (Henry Cavill) – accompany Hunt on the mission. Hunt and Hunley don't like this idea, but they're stuck with it.Cavill is a delightful addition to the franchise. It's clear from the start (and from the trailers) that his character is going to turn out to be a villain, but the actor brings charisma mixed with brutality. If Ethan Hunt is a ""scalpel"", as Sloan calls him, Cavill's Walker is a ""hammer."" He barrels through scenes, fists at the ready. Cavill's work here is more proof of how terribly served he's been by the DCEU. After the triple threat of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Justice League, I was actually starting to suspect Cavill was just a poor actor. Instead, he just needs to be in a franchise that understands how to use him. Here, he's holding his own against Tom Freakin' Cruise, and that's saying something.After a thrilling HALO jump sequence, Hunt and Walker end up in Paris, which gives way to a big, brutal, and funny bathroom fight. If this all sounds like a lot of action at once, you haven't seen anything yet. Fallout never lets up, and McQuarrie knows exactly how to keep it all very thrilling. The action is clear and concise – there's never a moment where the camera shakes, or the image blurs, and we're left wondering what is going on. McQuarrie understands that he has to get it all in frame, and make it look real, or else what's the point? He approaches the big action beats like something from a Buster Keaton movie – it's thrilling, it's jaw-dropping, it's surprisingly amusing. This isn't dour brutality for the sake of brutality. There's a playfulness to Fallout's action.Hunt and Walker soon cross paths with Rogue Nation breakout character Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Ilsa was out of the game at the end of Rogue Nation, but as she tells Ethan, she could never really be out. Not as long as Solomon Lane is still alive. Her mission, should she choose to accept it: find Lane and kill him, and then she can finally go home.As fate would have it, Lane ends up playing a big part in the mission Ethan is on. After making contact with the alluring arms dealer the White Widow (a feisty but sadly underused Vanessa Kirby), Ethan, Walker, Luther and Benji get caught up in a scheme to bust Lane out of custody. I won't sugarcoat things here: this entire set-up is maddeningly convoluted, and even hard to keep track of. As wonderful as Fallout is, its plotting is not nearly as tight as it could be – especially compared to the airtight Rogue Nation.Part of the confusion is a deliberate obfuscation on McQuarrie's part. He's keeping things vague to disguise a twist. Several twists, actually. One is that Walker is one of the Apostles. The other is that Lane has practically orchestrated almost everything going on here in order to get revenge on Ethan Hunt. It doesn't even add up – just how has Lane, who has been shuffled around in custody from one government to the next – been able to put this very elaborate plan in action? It's best not to think about it. This is a lot of balls to keep up in the air, and it could've backfired. If just one of these events lagged, or failed to entertain, the result could be a lopsided sequence in which we're cutting from a thrilling moment to a less-than-thrilling one. But McQuarrie keeps it all equally engaging, and tense, and funny. There's something inherently hilarious about watching Tom Cruise fly a helicopter, clearly unsure about what the hell he's doing.It culminates in a crash sequence, and then a fist-fight, and then a moment where Hunt and Walker are both dangling over the side of a cliff. I have to pause here to highlight how brilliantly McQuarrie plays the audience here. The important item in this scene is the detonator, and it keeps getting kicked around, dangerously close to the edge. The audience I saw the film with collectively lost their minds during this sequence, groaning in fear and delight at what was going on. They were hooked, wholly committed to what they were witnessing. It made the scene even better. This is a spoiler review, but you know how this all ends, even if you haven't seen the film. Ethan and his team triumph. Walker dies. Lane inexplicably survives (What's that about? There's no way he's coming back a third time, is he?). The bomb is very close to going off, and Ethan stops it with only seconds to spare. ""How close were we?"" his team asks later. ""The usual,"" he says, exhausted.There's an unexpected catharsis in the conclusion of Mission: Impossible – Fallout. McQuarrie can stage an action set-piece – and then some – but he also understands that he has to focus on character as well. Those action scenes wouldn't work nearly as well if we didn't give a shit about the people taking part in them.Ving Rhames is always a welcome presence – other than Cruise, he's the only actor to stick with the entire franchise – but his Luther Stickell has been a bit sidelined for a good portion of the franchise. He shows up, he cracks a few jokes, he looks at computer screens. Rhames is a pro, so he makes all of that work, but Fallout gives him more. First, he gets a surprisingly emotional moment with Ilsa in which he begs her to walk away, because he knows Ethan cares about her more than he wants to admit. Rhames' acting here – he remains almost inhumanly still, and brings his extremely deep voice down to a whisper – is hypnotic. We hang on his every word. Later, Luther gets to share a moment with Julia as they work together to disarm the bomb. It was a blast seeing Luther doing stuff – not just sitting in a van watching a monitor.And speaking of Julia, how nice it was to have her – and Michelle Monaghan – back. Ethan's marriage to Julia in Mission: Impossible III was never going to work. You can't have Ethan Hunt as a happily married man while he's running around doing dangerous stuff. The franchise could've simply forgotten Julia – killed her off, or never mentioned her again. But McQuarrie's script brings her back, and gives her something to do. She's not a damsel in distress; she's not a victim. She's right there, in the trenches, trying like hell to stop that bomb. The moment is slightly spoiled by a big emotional speech she gives Ethan at the end where she essentially says, ""I'm the woman I am today because of you, Ethan Hunt, most wonderful man on the planet!"" It again seems like producer Cruise is patting himself on the back a bit too much.Monaghan is one of those inherently likable, utterly charming actors, so much so that I still remain shocked she's not a superstar. She's not a complete unknown, of course, but it seems like her career should be bigger for how gifted she is. Nonetheless, she takes a very small part and turns it into something special here.If any team member is short-changed here, it's Pegg's Benji. He remains an indispensable member of the team, and always brings a bit of nervous-yet-funny relief to tense moments. But Benji doesn't have a whole lot to do here – although he does finally get to wear a mask – something he badly wanted to do in Rogue Nation – and he also takes part in a shockingly brutal fight sequence with Solomon Lane. In my extremely wordy retrospective on the franchise as a whole (read it here!), I commented that outside of Philip Seymour Hoffman's spectacularly scary baddie in M:I III, the Impossible franchise hasn't really had memorable villains. Lane came closest in Rogue Nation, and here he surpasses that. Sean Harris' work here isn't quite as good as Hoffman's (let's face – very few actors are as good as Hoffman was) – but the actor really sinks his teeth into the role this time. Lane was a bit aloof in Rogue Nation –  a guy with glasses and a permanent scowl. Here, he's terrifying, boiling with rage at Ethan and his team. The climactic sequence that pits Lane against Ilsa and Benji is so jarringly nasty that it caught me off-guard – we can feel Lane's brutality in the moment, and we so badly want Ilsa to kick his ass and put a stop to all of this.All's well that ends well, though. Ethan saves the day, he and his team share a laugh, Lane is handed over to MI6. All is right. Oh, except for Hunley. He died. It'll be a shame to lose Baldwin – he felt like he was just getting started with the series – but it'll be interesting to see who takes his place. Which brings me to one final question. Mission: Impossible has become the very-best action franchise around right now, and really one of the best franchises of all time. Cruise and company have built a legacy, with one film after another improving on the last. At 56 (I had to double-check to make sure that was right), Cruise shows no signs of slowing-down. Fallout had the biggest box office opening of the franchise to date. A new Mission is inevitable.But what direction will it go? Fallout has put the series in an interesting place. Up until now, one of Mission: Impossible's greatest assets was its ever-changing directors. Each new film brought on a new director, who then brought something new to the series. Fallout is the first film to carry a director over. And while McQuarrie deliberately changed crews from Rogue Nation and Fallout to make it seem different, one can't help but wonder if he'll be coming back for the next entry.A part of me wants someone new and exciting to step in. But McQuarrie has become so good at this – his direction here is astoundingly assured – that it would feel wrong to see him go. On that note, does the next entry follow in the footsteps of this film, and continue to be a direct sequel, or does it start fresh all over again? I sure as hell want more Ilsa Faust (although please, do not make her and Ethan lovers; they work much better as colleagues), and I definitely want more of Kirby's White Widow, which more or less confirms that I want the next film to be more of a direct follow-up.And yet, another big strength of the franchise has been its ability to adapt and do something different each time. For each sequel to stand on its own. Time will tell what happens. In the end, as long as Tom Cruise keeps running, I'll be watching. As long as the missions are there, I'll choose to accept them. But good lord, how do you top the action and excitement Fallout without giving audience members actual heart attacks?",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2018"," “Ethan Hunt is the living manifestation of destiny,” Impossible Missions Force (IMF) Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) says about the legendary undercover agent. While certainly cheesy, the line rings true in a lot of regards. Since 1996, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has always been on the run, whether it be from corrupt crime lords or his own life choices. He’s the “Gary Stu” of action franchises—able to jump from buildings or helicopters and escaping with barely a scratch. Sure, it’s ridiculous, but it’s also damn fun. Cruise has proven that he is one of the last true movie stars, and at 56 years of age, he shows no signs of stopping. Cruise lives to please audiences with his impeccable stunts and unlimited amount of charisma. And even though Cruise is slowly starting to wear down (he broke his ankle jumping across a building), he keeps it together and delivers a delicious can of whoop-ass. After five installments, you would think that a franchise would be way past its prime, but Mission Impossible is one of the rare exceptions. Its sixth title, Fallout could easily be labeled as the franchise’s magnum opus; Director Christopher McQuarrie and his crew (the only director to helm a 2nd Mission Impossible film) creates a visual spectacle which is light on the CGI and heavy on the extreme stunts. Mission Impossible: Fallout brings back Ethan Hunt (Cruise), IMF’s top agent, who’s keeping a low profile two years after catching renowned terrorist, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). However, Lane’s imprisonment is only causing more problems, with a terrorist group called The Apostles  seeking the highly volatile plutonium to plan a nuclear attack. When a showdown has Ethan choose between his old pal, Luther (Ving Rhames) and millions of people, he chooses the former, letting the Apostles run off with the package. Hunt and his gang are on the move, but nothing without some extra baggage. CIA Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) is assigned to follow Hunt’s every move and terminate him if need be. Fallout brings back franchise favorites such as Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), as well as Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who brings a whole new meaning to the romantic phrase, “will they or won’t they?” It also brings in new characters such as White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), the femme-fatale type who brings her own swagger. In terms of development, they don’t hold a candle to Ethan, but their chemistry with the leading man brings a much needed lightness  to the film. The only character able to compete with Cruise’s charm is Cavill’s Agent Walker. His beautiful, seductive mustache was worth the cost of Justice League. It may not have been particularly necessary, but it gave Walker a extra dose of personality to his already mysterious nature. The Mission Impossible franchise has managed to outdo itself in terms of action. Each director has put a bit of their own personality into each fight scene, and McQuarrie is no different. Whether it’s the 25,000 foot Halo Jump or the bare-knuckled fight in the club bathroom, it’s easy to appreciate the tremendous amount of hard work that Mcquarrie and his crew put into each sequence. They make sure that we feel the momentum of every punch, kick, and crash, and it leaves us wanting so much more. It may be impossible (pun intended) to follow Fallout’s plot, but narrative structure isn’t the reason to see this movie. McQuarrie and Cruise create another “balls-to-the wall” adventure that is the true definition of a summer blockbuster. It’s not clear whether Cruise will be up for another secret agent role, but if not, this was the perfect send-off for one of the most iconic action stars.

"Jul 30, 2018"," Complain, if you must, that your local cinema is stuffed with nothing but sequels. Just don’t kid yourself that the stuffing is anything new. As Tom Cruise guns his motorbike around the Arc de Triomphe (against the traffic, naturally), in his latest venture, “—Fallout,” you may tell yourself, “Yeah, nice, but didn’t he ride a similar machine in ‘Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation’?” Indeed he did. And don’t forget the bike-off in “Mission: Impossible 2,” when he and the villain did wheelies at each other, like stags locking antlers in the rutting season. But spare a thought for your great-great-grandparents, off to the pictures, more than a century ago. They, likewise, will have muttered, “Here we go again,” as Helen Holmes—every bit as determined as Cruise, and no less capable of performing her own stunts—mounted a motorbike and hared off in pursuit of a runaway train. That’s what she did in “The Wild Engine,” which was released in 1915. It was the twenty-sixth film in “The Hazards of Helen” series, and Holmes’s last in the leading role, yet the franchise was far from done. There were ninety-three episodes to go. Movies, in short, picked up where serialized fiction left off. The idea that we should be rewarded for our loyalty with the promise of further thrills, or gags, may have been a marketing tool, designed to woo us back into the dark, but it continues to feed a fundamental hunger. We are storyvores, dependent on a diet of narrative, and the words “Coming Soon” are doubly tempting when we have already wolfed down an earlier portion of the product. Hence my appetite for “Mission: Impossible—Fallout.” Given that the franchise is now a sextalogy, or a six-pack, or whatever, it should long since have grown weary, stale, and flat. Yet it has never been unprofitable, and around the halfway mark it began, unaccountably, to improve. The last movie, “Rogue Nation” (2015), was the best to date, with a sequence set at the opera, in Vienna, that I still watch on a quarterly basis. How can “Fallout” compete with that? To an extent, it can’t. There was an unexpected suavity to “Rogue Nation,” thanks to the tuxedos, the snatches of Puccini, and the stride of the plot, which suggested that saving the world might yet be achieved in style. The new film, though longer (it runs for nearly two and a half hours), somehow feels more rushed, while sticking to the belief that, in the search for the right kind of force, you can’t beat brute. Thus, we get Henry Cavill as August Walker, a homicidal slab of meat from the C.I.A. who could slice you open with a single swipe of his mustache. We also get a three-person brawl in a men’s room, which causes irreparable damage to the sanitary ware, and which is clearly indebted to the punch-up at the start of “Casino Royale” (2006)—the scene in which Daniel Craig, fresh to the role of 007, showed his credentials by destroying a toilet cubicle. In more gratifying ways, however, “Fallout” maintains the good spirits of its predecessor. Many of the cast are back for more. Hello again to Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the villain who could use a moral conscience and a bottle of throat linctus; to Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), notionally a British agent, although you can never tell; and to Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), the middleman between the U.S. government and the Impossible Missions Force. Cruise, as usual, plays Ethan Hunt, the sharp end of the I.M.F., with Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) as his fixers. The director of “Rogue Nation,” Christopher McQuarrie, returns for duty, too. The word “fallout” in the title derives not, as you might imagine, from Ethan’s pathological urge to tumble out of aircraft, or high windows, but from three hefty spheres of plutonium. Were they hung, perhaps, outside the shop of a radioactive pawnbroker? Anyway, they go missing, and Hunley suspects a sinister group called the Apostles. They could be the same Apostles who convene at Cambridge in semi-secrecy, for the purposes of intellectual discussion, and whose past members include Tennyson and John Maynard Keynes, but, on balance, I think not. What matters is that, with a nuclear explosion pending, Ethan has seventy-two hours to get those balls back. Intellectual discussion will have to wait. At a certain point in any movie franchise, the self-references become less jaunty and more needling, with characters who jab at one another’s raison d’être. We all know the tape recording to which, at the outset of every tale, Ethan has to listen, complete with its gentlemanly caveat, “Your mission, should you choose to accept it.” On this occasion, that offer is roundly mocked, as Lane says to Ethan, “Your mission, should you choose to accept it. I wonder, Ethan, did you ever choose not to?” An excellent question, and the mood is toughened by Hunley’s boss, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), who describes the I.M.F. as “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat.” The masks have been a proud staple of the “Mission: Impossible” films since 1996, when what appeared to be Jon Voight unpeeled his features to reveal those of Cruise. (Don’t mention the height difference.) Thenceforth, throughout the series, we have been permanently and deliciously unable to decide who, at any moment, is who. “Fallout” is extra confusing in this regard, because Ethan’s former wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), absent since “Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol” (2011), shows up anew and turns out to bear a strange resemblance to Ilsa Faust. One woman, two masks? Two women, one mask? God knows. In terms of female representation, the “Mission: Impossible” saga was woefully slow off the mark. The original movie succeeded in wasting Emmanuelle Béart and Kristin Scott Thomas, and it wasn’t really until Ferguson sallied into film No. 5, toting an assassin’s rifle, that progress began to be made. “Fallout” sustains the momentum, courtesy of Bassett, Monaghan, and Vanessa Kirby, last seen as Princess Margaret in “The Crown,” and now granted the type of part that a yawning royal might dream of—a negotiator known as the White Widow, whose motives are no easier to discern, or to guard against, than the knife that she straps to her thigh. What these women bring to the film is an adult impatience, gilded with sly amusement, at the international antics of the boys. “Please don’t make me go through you,” Ilsa warns Ethan, as if he were made of tissue paper. Helen Holmes would approve. To be fair, you can scoff at the antics and still be swept away. The final quarter of “Mission: Impossible—Fallout” takes place in Kashmir, with a helicopter chase through deep gullies and past snowy peaks. McQuarrie keeps the action crisp and clear, to match the icy air. In essence, and despite the vastness of his budget, he is doing what his forebears did a hundred years ago—seeking out ever more outrageous ways in which to leave an audience dangling. You want a cliffhanger? Simple. Get hold of Tom Cruise and hang him off a cliff. That’s how the second “Mission: Impossible” film began, and it’s how the sixth arrives at a climax. Let’s hope for more vertiginous hoopla of this sort. Coming soon. The heroine of “Puzzle” is Agnes (Kelly Macdonald), a housewife of Hungarian stock. She lives in Bridgeport, Connecticut, with her chunky husband, Louie (David Denman), and their sons, Ziggy (Bubba Weiler) and Gabe (Austin Abrams). Agnes is both consumed and—in her own mind—defined by her domestic duties, reluctant to tread beyond the confines of the kitchen, the laundry room, and the church. In the bedroom, the only sound is the snoring of her mate. Something transformative, we realize, has to land in Agnes’s life, so what will it be? An alien, an angel, a lottery win, a criminal on the run? Nope. A jigsaw. You could watch the first few minutes of “Puzzle,” which is directed by Marc Turtletaub, under the sincere impression that it is set in the nineteen-forties. The colors are muted, the costumes are dowdy, and the air of suburban suppression is close to asphyxiating. “I haven’t been to New York for years,” Agnes admits. It comes as a jolt, then, when she is given an iPhone for her birthday. More to her taste is a new jigsaw, which she completes at dizzying speed. Inspired, she contacts a fellow-devotee, a wealthy sluggard named Robert (Irrfan Khan), who inquires, “How long have you been puzzling?”—a lovely line. By way of a test, he tips out a jigsaw, starts the clock, and stares in awe as, not long afterward, she fits the final piece. “Fuck me!” he says. And she does.

"Jul 30, 2018"," IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and long-time associates Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are on the trail of the Syndicate, a rogue anarchist network of former spies. When their op goes awry, Ethan and his team must race to avert catastrophe. So far, so Mission: Impossible. Yet in this sixth instalment, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie has elevated the formula to its highest possible point. Not only is Fallout the best Mission: Impossible film by a considerable margin, it is also undoubtedly the best action film of the year. The long-running series has generally been received warmly by audiences and critics, but has rarely inspired the high praise or devotion that, say, the best of the Bourne or the Bond franchises inspire. Yet with this entry, McQuarrie has made Mission: Impossible the action series to beat. Although six films in, Fallout is the only one to entice a director to make a second entry – here McQuarrie returning from the last M:I film, Rogue Nation. Each of the prior films brought with them their own directors and visions – the dark Euro-spy intrigue of Brian de Palma’s first entry, or the colourful, cartoony fun of Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, for example. Having directed two films in the franchise, McQuarrie breaks somewhat of a tradition, but also deepens the series’ mythology while polishing the new film’s style to a burnished finish. Mission: Impossible is unlikely to ever be accused of having characters with psychological depth, but several dream sequences do provide Hunt with a modicum of interiority. It certainly goes some way to explaining his (and by proxy, Cruise’s) demented pursuit of exponentially outrageous stunts. And what stunts Cruise gifts us here – easily the most elaborate, lengthy and death-defying of all six films. The HALO jump is worth the admission price alone, made all the more astonishing that it really is Cruise falling through the sky. The camera going in and out of focus is less a stylistic flourish and more a result of the cameraman heroically wrangling with a head-mounted rig as they plummet to the ground. The visuals, even in the film’s more sedate moments, are the best the series has ever seen. Solo’s controversial low lighting is brought to mind with Rob Hardy’s noirish, moody cinematography, yet the darkness perfectly suits this material, introducing a sense of intrigue that has been absent from the series since de Palma’s twisty-turny original. Fallout is, as ever, Cruise’s show, but his supporting cast admirably round the film out, both with affectionate, often humorous turns from Rhames and Pegg, Alec Baldwin’s returning IMF secretary and Angela Bassett’s tough CIA director. Finishing the cast is Henry Cavill’s Agent Walker, a lunk with about as much charm as his infamous moustache, his oaken, Schwarzenegger-esque physicality contrasted with Cruise’s wiry frame. If there are any weak links it is, invariably in the women characters – more or less pushed to the sidelines as tropey femme fatales and plot devices. Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) proves the exception here as the MI6 agent from Rogue Nation with an agenda of her own – though even she feels a little underused. Nevertheless, the whole machine is so finely tuned that these quibbles barely register as flaws. A film like Mission: Impossible will never be considered high cinema, and nor does it need to be. But as the best possible version of itself, Fallout is essentially perfect.",POSITIVE

"Jul 29, 2018"," In the 22 years since the original Mission: Impossible, Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt remains the same, moral compass and handsome, suspiciously unlined face very much intact. Hunt’s slick stunts created a new template for the spy thriller’s action man hero, but what sets him apart from his grittier contemporaries is his American altruism. Bond is misanthropic, Bourne solipsistic, John Wick (though a vigilante hitman, not a hero) spurred by revenge. Hunt, on the other hand, is defined by his “pathetic morality”, a weakness parlayed in this sixth instalment into something worth celebrating. This time, three silvery orbs of plutonium have fallen into the hands of the Apostles, an anarchist group planning to use them to blow up the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca. Willing to trade the explosives for Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), whom Hunt captured in Rogue Nation, Hunt’s hands are tied. He is aided by trusty accomplices Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg, on goofy, enjoyable form), and, to his annoyance, CIA errand boy Agent Walker (Henry Cavill). CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) describes him as a “hammer” to Hunt’s “scalpel”, though an attractively carved block of wood would be more precise. More dynamic is coquettish criminal broker White Widow (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby, who speaks with a fabulous, velvety purr). Cleanly choreographed set pieces see the 56-year-old Cruise bungee-jumping into the eye of a lightning storm, swishing through a Parisian club, swinging through the bowels of London’s Tate Modern and rasping lines such as: “We’ll burn that bridge when we get to it” with a straight face. The charismatic Cruise commands motorcycles, helicopters, ropes and rubber masks, as well as the fluttering hearts of two women from his past (Michelle Monaghan’s Julia and Rebecca Ferguson’s former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust). Genre convention means it’s a foregone conclusion that this mission is not, in fact, “impossible”, but director Christopher McQuarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2018"," Haunted by his past but as determined as ever, IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) accepts his newest mission: the return of three weapons-grade spheres of plutonium before they can be claimed by the remains of the clandestine Rogue Nation, a group rebranding themselves as “The Apostles.” When the deal goes sour and the spheres are stolen, Secretary Hunley (Alec Baldwin) finds his authority over the IMF undermined by Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) who wants her trusted agent-with-mustache installed (Henry Cavill) to keep an eye on Ethan after his questionable failure. With his support team of Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) watching his back along with the apt appearance of an old contact (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethan does what he’s best at — but this time the stakes are not only the world but as personal as they come. Since re-inventing the television series in 1996 for cinema by ripping up the team dynamic, it took J.J. Abrams directing M:I-3 to bring it back, reinstating a physical team to counter the Bond-like antics of Cruise’s Agent Hunt. Brad Bird carried this concept into Ghost Protocol before director Christopher McQuarrie escalated it into Rogue Nation, establishing a SPECTRE-like organization of former spies fed up with the shallow commands of their political masters. As the first actual sequel to a previous installment, Fallout touches on nearly every Cruise-controlled mission before it, but will recapturing the imagination and adventure for summer audiences translate into continued success at the box office?

In a world where it’s become politically incorrect to accuse an entire nation of being “bad guys,” the spy vs. spy dynamic rules the roost, recently illustrated by the success of Charlize Theron’s Atomic Blonde. The game is no longer out-teching the competition — everyone has access to the same — but to use it in the most unpredictable ways that count on misdirection and taking advantage of spy-thought. By combining a complex plot for thinkers, an action-adventure for thrill-seekers, and a buddy-comedy dynamic for those still on the fence, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is prebuilt to accomplish what few can: appeal to just about everyone and sacrifice nothing for it. The Cruise/McQuarrie dynamic is now in its third film, hinting at the shorthand and trust these two have in making a film together. While it’s a valid complaint many sequences in Fallout go on too long — the helicopter and motorcycle chases to name two — they’re not without purpose. The film stuffs a lot of plot into two hours and twenty minutes, to the point where Cavill’s character Walker even hangs a lantern on the thought of how over-complicated it is… and he’s right. The best bits are the double-crosses, showing us what’s right in front of us and then showing us what really happened, a clandestine chess game where having the tech toys isn’t as important as exploiting them to their fullest. Getting in on the espionage act briefly this time, Baldwin’s Hunley admits he gets why the IMF enjoys the work. To the advertising team’s credit, very little is revealed about the actual plot in the trailers, seeding more than a little misdirection with both dream sequences and out-of-order staged stunts, all used to the best effect. If there’s anything bad to be said about the film, it’s predictable in its unpredictability: something always goes wrong and there’s one more unknown variable that pops up at the last moment, so you know nothing goes exactly the way you think it will until the last wire is cut, the bad guy is foiled, and the day is saved. You didn’t buy a movie ticket to watch evil win, did you? That’s what horror films are for.

MOVIE REVIEW – MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT. With Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Rated PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language. 147 minutes.
 The late Albert “Cubby” Broccoli, producer of the James Bond movies, used to say that his rule in creating one of the most successful movie franchises of all time was to “put all the money up on the screen.” In other words, if the audience couldn’t see it, why were they spending money on it? The makers of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT – the sixth film in the series based on the ‘60s television show – have taken that advice to heart. It’s a mixture of suspense, adrenaline-pumping thrills, exotic locations, and just the right touch of humor, making this entry in the franchise the most entertaining one yet. The movie’s convoluted plot takes a while to unfold. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) accept the mission of recovering some stolen plutonium. When things go wrong, the director of the CIA (Angela Bassett) forces the team to take on one of her agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill), over the objections of Hunt’s boss (Alec Baldwin). When Hunt goes to make a deal with a mysterious heiress known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), he learns that British spy/past romantic interest Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is also involved, as is his old nemesis former spy-turned-terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Got all that? It gets even more complicated because several of the people mentioned are double agents or have secret agendas and characters may turn out to be someone else in disguise. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie may be more interested in extended chases and suspense scenes – including no less than three last-second rescues intercut with each other – but he also gives the characters time to be more than stick figures running around and to show that they aren’t quite superheroes. A frequent response to how they’re going to handle a seemingly insurmountable problem is, “We’ll figure it out.” As with the classic Bond films, money has been spent on extensive location shooting, with wild chase sequences in Paris and London. The Paris chase is a film in itself with several twists along the way. The London chase has Cruise – doing his own stuntwork – in hot pursuit while jumping from rooftop to rooftop. It was during this sequence that the actor, who just turned 56 this month, broke his ankle, necessitating a seven-week shutdown of the production. Given what he does on screen, he’s lucky that’s all he broke. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His latest novel is Time on My Hands: My Misadventures in Time Travel. He is the 2018 recipient of the Skylark Award given by the New England Science Fiction Association. He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018"," He broke his ankle making Mission: Impossible – Fallout, but it was all worth it. Tom Cruise’s sixth go-round as IMF leader Ethan Hunt is an unqualified corker of a summer action film, the best in the series that has been going since 1996. As I say in my video review above, the M:I franchise just keeps topping itself, which I didn’t think was a mission possible after the double whammy of the two previous films, 2011’s Ghost Protocol, and especially 2015’s Rogue Nation, but in bringing back writer-director Christopher McQuarrie from the latter film (the first time a director has repeated duties for the series), be assured we are in good hands again. After making $2.8 billion worldwide for the first five films, it is no wonder Paramount and Skydance would want to keep a good thing going, even if its seemingly fearless star is getting close to 60. Of course, that hasn’t stopped the likes of Denzel Washington, Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson from going for all the action marbles, and Cruise is just 56, so on the basis of this one, let’s hope he accepts a couple more missions. What makes the series so great is it relies less on CGI trickery (a la Skyscraper) and more on good old-fashioned stunt work, with a derring-do star who can effortlessly convince the audience it is really him doing these feats. Cruise famously broke an ankle while jumping from one rooftop to another in London (piece of cake, right?) and forced a production shutdown. But he still finished the stunt even in that level of pain, and the results are quite visible on screen without missing a beat. That bit was small potatoes compared to some of the set pieces here, including a thrilling skydiving sequence in which Ethan and rogue CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) must pull off parachuting together 25,000 feet in the sky. There’s also an incredible (no hyperbole) helicopter duel between the pair that comes toward the end of the film that has to be seen to be believed. Of course there are also the de rigueur chases on foot, motorcycle and BMW throughout Paris, just one of many picaresque exotic locations chosen this time that also include Queensland, London and rural mountainous regions of Norway. The title alone indicates that the stakes have to be ratcheted up each time. I am not sure how the 1960s TV series this all came from managed to top itself each week, but that often was with clever disguises donned by the regulars in ingenious sequences. Perhaps that is why I also loved the opening scenes of this film, which are a tip of the hat to what the old series did so well. It’s a heck of a lot to fun. Plot-wise this edition revolves around finding three missing plutonium cores, which are the height of danger in this nuclear age. The main villain from Rogue Nation, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), is now in custody and literally tied up, but he’s still up to no good and you can bet he will do what he can to make matters worse for the IMF in recovering these missing elements. He has never gotten over the fact that Ethan screwed up his life and evil plans and works to keep up the pressure, on land or under water. There also are big complications with Walker, the CIA agent foisted on Hunt by new take-no-prisoners CIA director Ericka Sloan (Angela Bassett) — a guy with a definitely dark view of the world, determined to execute his own agenda. It is a clever bit of casting to have an actor like Cavill to play him, a star mostly known for Superman. He can’t shake his stiff presence onscreen, but the pairing with Cruise actually works. The other new addition to the cast is Vanessa Kirby (The Crown), who plays a mysterious arms dealer named Alana aka the White Widow. Fortunately the franchise regulars all are back including Ving Rhames as Luther (a staple since M:I began); Simon Pegg, more circumspect this time as Benjy; Alec Baldwin as former CIA director Alan Hunley, who now is secretary for IMF; and returning from No. 5 is the alluring assassin Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). A highlight also is the return of Hunt’s wife Julia, who was last seen in M:I-3. Again in the hands of Michelle Monaghan, there is a poignant reunion in store for the pair that brings closure to that time in Hunt’s life. At nearly 2 1/2 hours, you get your money’s worth for this Mission — which not only is the best one yet, it is also the best summer film of the summer and a template for what a great action movie should be. Producers are Cruise, J.J. Abrams, McQuarrie, and Jake Myers. Paramount opens it this Friday.

"Jul 28, 2018"," 
  IT’S pretty remarkable that by the sixth instalment in an action franchise things haven’t become stale. The Mission: Impossible series, powered for more than two decades now by the incomparable Tom Cruise, has always strived to be different, to change things up film to film and push things forward in terms of scale and wow-factor stunts.
 
  What’s even more amazing is that it’s the best one yet, going about its business with clockwork narrative precision, thrillingly achieved action and surprising emotional resonance, fully earning its hefty 147-minute runtime with barely an ounce of fat on it. It’s something of a triumph.
 
  Interestingly, Fallout changes things up by actually keeping things the same. It’s the first to keep the previous film’s director in Christopher McQuarrie, female co-lead in Rebecca Ferguson’s enigmatic British agent Ilsa Faust and villain in Sean Harris’s now-imprisoned but endlessly scheming Solomon Lane.
 
  We catch up with IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) who finds himself in hot water with the US government after a mission to retrieve some stolen plutonium goes awry. Another mission is then sanctioned by his superior, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), for Hunt and his loyal tech-savvy team members Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg, still providing great comic relief) to defuse the imminent nuclear threat for good.
 
  Hunt finds himself clashing with world-class and ruthless Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), who has been sent along on the mission at the behest of cautious CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to make sure it all goes to plan this time.
 
  McQuarrie’s sharply written script gives the cast the chance to really shine in smaller character moments peppered throughout the film, lending it a refreshing emotional clout so often missing from these sorts of gargantuan summer movies. Cruise brings forward the resonance of a character he’s inhabited since the mid-90s in a way that proves satisfying for those who have followed it over the years.
 
  Needless to say he commits to the role 100%, unafraid to show emotional and physical vulnerability as a hero and diving head first (sometimes literally) into the all-important action in a way that few other actors would. That sort of commitment really does make the difference and is part of why the series has endured so well.
 
  There isn’t a single false step or cheap action beat; each one feels grand and exciting and perfectly paced. They almost feel in competition with one another to up the ante, from an utterly brutal hand-to-hand fight in a pristine club bathroom that feels like it’s straight out of The Raid, to a stunning helicopter dogfight that’s as good as anything you’re likely to see in action cinema.
 
  They’re the life-blood pulsing through the veins of an intelligent and intricately plotted spy movie, one that knowingly plays into the tropes of the genre – bomb timers ticking agonisingly close to zero, impossibly high-tech gadgets, double and triple crosses – whilst also subverting those preconceived notions with shrewd plot turns or surprising character reactions layered into against-the-clock chase sequences.
 
  Cruise and McQuarrie continue to make for a great star-director combo, succeeding with flying colours in their accepted mission to outdo themselves. This is how you do an action blockbuster.

"Jul 28, 2018"," Christopher McQuarrie  (“Jack Reacher”/”The Way of the Gun”) directs and writes the sixth MI franchise film installment starring Tom Cruise as a covert super-spy MI agent. It’s filled with action, thrills, fist-fights (topped with a rousing martial arts brawl in a Paris restroom), a few betrayals, world travel (with action scenes in Paris, London and Kashmir), mask disguises, an abduction, parachuting onto the roof of the Grand Palais, jumping off an office building, hanging from an airborne helicopter, climbing a steep rock mountain, a motorcycle chase through the Paris streets, dismantling nuclear bombs in the nick of time and a few other adventures I might have left out from memory exhaustion. It’s hokum, of course, but for Cruise lovers and action pic fans, it makes for an entertaining summer blockbuster pic if you can get over how absurd it all is.  It surrounds Cruise with an admirable ensemble cast and a chance for the 56-year-old star to do his own stunts-no matter how difficult they are physically. The production values are high and the direction is slick, feeding right into its star’s wheelhouse and big ego. While the spy story is complex and enigmatic, it’s only logical in a James Bond movie-like way. It follows the franchise framing device of delivering a disposable tape in an old-fashioned tape recorder crammed into a book to see if agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) accepts this impossible mission to save the world. Hunt accepts and recruits his usual team of tech support, the reliable Luther (Ving Rhames) and the cheeky Benji (Simon Pegg), to help retrieve three stolen balls of plutonium, which a sicko terrorist group known as “The Apostles” plans to make into nuclear bombs and have one of its group nuke the world to serve as a painful lesson for the old world order over their hypocrisy over nukes. In charge of the team is the eager-beaver transfer from the CIA, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). After a botched meeting for Hunt’s team to purchase the nuclear goods, the plutonium is lost and Hunt ventures to Paris. There he tries to get the missing plutonium through the help of a black marketeer arms broker, the sexy White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), whose clients have it. The not to be trusted Hunt is forced by the CIA honcho (Angela Bassett) to take on the mission the shady CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), who is to keep an eye on him. Things get more fuzzy when a rogue former British MI6 operative, Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), shows up on her own secret mission impossible. In the convoluted plot it all boils down to the good-guy team being informed that they must get their hands on imprisoned bad guy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who started the venal Apostle destructive mission, and swap him for the plutonium.  Some mush is delivered when Hunt obsessively pines over his ex-wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), when he shows up in Kashmir. He left his lost love in order for her to be out of harm’s way while married to him. It’s a film that takes its stunts seriously, and should be pleasing to viewers into this kind of disposable action popcorn flick.  At over two-and-a-half hours, my tolerance for the one too many cliff hanger scenes and its humorless dialogue was beginning to wane. But I viewed it under Cruise control and couldn’t resist all its Hollywood gusto and explosions.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018","Not only is it the best movie of the summer, it's also one of the best action films of all time. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018"," The “Mission Impossible” film series launched in 1996 produced by and starring Tom Cruise at age 33 brought Cruise’s action skills to the forefront. In “Fallout,” 2018, the sixth film in the series, Cruise now age 56, continues to astound as an action hero. Age has its advantage here—as you can’t help but commend his perseverance in continuing to not only perform most of his own stunts, (at his age), but he continues to ‘raise the action bar’—regardless of your feelings toward Cruise as an individual his astonishing action skills can’t be ignored. Cruise has also made some smart choices in casting by continuing with screenwriter and director Christopher McQuarrie, of the prior film “Rogue Nation,” as well as expanding the female roles by adding more characters. Actress Rebecca Ferguson (Ilsa Faust), a former MI6 agent who has her own agenda at times shares the lead with Cruise. Bringing back (Michelle Monaghan) Ethan Hunt’s wife and resolving that storyline; gives us Ethan’s soft side, while visually showing us he’s human.
Another brilliant move is the addition of Angela Bassett (Erika Sloane), as the tough as nails CIA Director as she brings a different type of attitude to the character; she is ultra strong in her position with no hesitation in questioning the MIF on their motives and actions. Both female characters Erika Sloane and Ilsa Faust are timely in leveling the action genre playing field by providing intelligent, powerful and strong women roles—I applaud this move. To be frank, adding Jeremy Renner as a side-kick in the prior films was a good move in sharing Cruise’s spotlight, however; “Fallout’s” character changes are decisively a greater mix. Casting a bearded Henry Cavill a CIA Operative Assassin (August Walker) best known as (Superman/Clark Kent 2013, 2016, 2017) ultimately provides a deeper appreciation for Ethan Hunt also works well. Aside from the character changes, the visual effects and stunt work is another reason the film is such a standout. I’ve learned a new acronym HALO (High Altitude Low Opening) referring to helicopter jumping— special military operatives have used it in order to go as secretly as possible into an area. In “Fallout” Tom Cruise completed over 100 HALO jumps to get the right sequence. The stunts are reminiscent of the “Fast and Furious” series at times particularly with the ‘Tokyo drifting’ car chases, and has the nonstop intense action feel of “Mad Max.” It distinctly retains its own identity with it’s star, (Cruise), Ethan Hunt’s hyper speed running, motorcycle stunts and HALO jumps. Most have seen the trailer of the battling helicopters; I can honestly say, “You ain’t seen nothing yet, as the conclusion of that scene alone is worth the price of admission.” Another thrilling adrenaline scene is the rooftop building jumps as in a Mario Bros. video game. Similar in concept, except MIF team partner Benji Dunn (Simon Peg) controls Hunt’s moves via remote communication, as to the direction; right or left turns, leaping straight on from one building to another building or jumping down a few stories. The result creates hysterical banter between the pair all while the audience is clinching deeper into their armrests with intermittent sighs of relief as the moves land. The plot centers on a group called the Apostles with the goal to create chaos employing suffering and death. It appears they’ve been scheming with an insider named John Lark to obtain plutonium to create three dirty bombs. Hunt’s boss Alan Hundley (Alec Baldwin) sends him to Paris to locate John Lark before he’s able to buy the plutonium. He’s also given an unwanted sidekick, August Walker. Here’s where the action starts to ante up, with motorcycle chases, Hunt running full speed, building leaps and plenty of martial arts hand to hand combat fighting. After Paris, the film shifts to London, with the finale in Kashmir Valley in India at the base of the Himalayan Mountains. The ending has three different storylines running simultaneously with razor-sharp precision, all nail-biting till the end. The last 45 minutes contain some of the best action sequences to date. They are thrilling, intense and entertaining. It also appears that filmmakers have a message they’d like you to take away from the film. Here’s a line from the narrative regarding Ethan Hunt, “We need people like you that care about the life of just one as they do millions.” I sense Hunt being called a hero without specifically saying the word; another character said to Hunt, “I sleep soundly at night knowing you’re here.” My take away—I appreciated the addition of the strong female roles, the exhilarating action scenes along with the film’s implication—that all lives matter.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2018"," If Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was like shotgunning a beer and diving off a roof into a pool, then its follow up, Mission: Impossible – Fallout, is like shotgunning TWO beers and back-flipping out of an airplane while making out with the prom king and/or queen. It’s another astounding action spectacle from writer/director Chris McQuarrie and producer-star Tom Cruise, who have perfected the craft of making this kind of movie. Plot? Barely matters! Characters? Cartoonish! Action? F*CKING RAD.  The narrative exists solely to carry you to the next breathless stunt sequence, but at the same time, the movie is plotted well enough that you’re not left wondering what is going on or how things connect. Characters are stripped down to the bare minimum of human behavior, but everyone’s motivation is clear and while Fallout isn’t really invested in mystery, it constructs such a ridiculously Rube Goldberg plot that it becomes a self-perpetuating tension machine. It’s less about who the bad guys are, and more about how the good guys win, and whether or not Tom Cruise will ever stop running. The old M:I gang returns, including Cruise as inscrutable badass Ethan Hunt, Ving Rhames as tough but tender Luther, and Simon Pegg as comic relief nerd Benji. Also back is Rebecca Ferguson as Ilsa Faust, who is still a total scene stealer (if Cruise ever does quit this franchise, Ferguson should inherit it). And new this time out is The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby as a shady lady called the White Widow, and Henry Cavill’s Mustache as CIA assassin Walker. Kirby is obviously relishing her femme fatale role but sadly does not have nearly enough to do—similarly hung out to dry is Angela Bassett as a CIA chief—so I hope she comes back in the inevitable next M:I movie. She barely had one scene with Ferguson and the White Widow and Ilsa Faust REALLY need to be murder frenemies and make my life. Making a surprisingly good showing is Henry Cavill’s Mustache. Like in The Man from U.N.C.L.E., he displays way more charisma here than he does as Superman. He is also obviously enjoying his change-of-pace role, and having a thick and luxuriant lip cape and not a weird gummy digital nightmare mouth. It’s amazing what not having half your face erased does for one’s acting. Also, he is like twice the size of Tom Cruise and the forced perspective to make him and Cruise appear to be the same size is HILARIOUS. Poor Mustache, relegated to the background in so many group shots. At this point the main draw for a Mission movie is the action, and the action in Fallout is bonkers. There is a great car chase, a bathroom smack-down in the style of John Wick, a helicopter chase, and Tom Cruise runs for like ten straight minutes. To an extent I think they’re forever chasing the high-water mark of the vault heist from the first Mission: Impossible, but chasing that gold standard leads to some really fun, thrilling sequences—seriously, the car chase is GREAT. And Henry Cavill’s Mustache is a capable stunt actor, and a good match for Cruise in that regard, which leads to some of the best fisticuffs in this franchise. You’re here for the action, and the action will not let you down.  Mission: Impossible - Fallout is two and a half hours of adrenaline-soaked action and it is here to rock your face off. It’s stands among the best technical blockbuster filmmaking you will see, with no pretensions about its own charms or why you’re there to see it. It might as well start with an epigraph that says Buckle the f*ck up followed by a giant explosion and an air horn. Fallout is like “Carla was the prom queen”,  Johnny Utah firing into the air, and the whole Bullitt chase wrapped into one. ",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018",...the always hyperbolic action scenes are balanced with a few humorous notes that do not seem untimely interferences and with emotional strokes that are maintained several degrees by below sentimental overweight. [Full Review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Tom Cruise has been starring in Mission: Impossible movies for 22 years, and his character, un-killable super-spy Ethan Hunt, has been on the job for about the same length of time. Hunt isn’t an archetype like James Bond, kept forever young(-ish) by recasting the role and disregarding continuity. The things that happened to thirtysomething Ethan Hunt in 1996 (and since) have shaped the fiftysomething man he is now. The deliriously exciting sixth chapter, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the first episode to acknowledge the events of a previous one, but it’s the first to really consider their weight and bring all the chickens home to roost. A direct sequel to Rogue Nation (and again written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the only repeat customer in this franchise), Fallout also has significant references to III and minor references to I and Ghost Protocol. Even II, everyone’s least favorite entry, is represented in the form of rock-climbing. And Ethan? Oh, he’s pluggin’ away, running faster, falling farther, and clinging longer than ever before, as if trying to convince us (or himself) that he’s still got it. But it’s taking its toll. He has guilty nightmares about ruining the life of his one true love, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). When faced with a choice between saving one life and saving millions — which happens to him with alarming frequency — he’s still always unable to make the “correct” choice and save the millions. Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), the former CIA boss now heading the IMF, sees this as one of Ethan’s strengths: a savior of the world who cares about the one as much as the many. The new CIA boss, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), sees it as a weakness. That’s partly why she insists on sending a CIA operative, August Walker (Henry Cavill), with Ethan and his team on the latest mission, which involves recovering plutonium from an anarchist group affiliated with the last movie’s baddie, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who’s in custody getting the crap interrogated out of him. The only reason the anarchists have the plutonium is that Ethan let it out of his sight while saving Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) — and yes, Ethan feels very bad about this, you don’t need to rub it in, ERICA SLOAN. Ethan and Walker go to Paris in search of an enigmatic weapons dealer named John Lark, resulting in a slam-bang two-on-one fight that destroys most of a pristine white nightclub bathroom. Then it’s off to meet with a broker, called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), who lays out her plutonium-possessing clients’ terms: They won’t sell it, but they’ll trade it for Solomon Lane. And you know who else wants Solomon Lane? Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the kickass MI6 agent who was first introduced to us while working undercover for him. So it’s business as usual, plotwise. But from the pre-titles vignette to the cliffside climax, McQuarrie and Cruise are determined to entertain us to within an inch of our lives, or die in the attempt. They pack the film with one adrenaline-charged sequence after another — a terrifying skydiving mission; a breathless motorcycle chase; close-quarters knife fights; abundant running, leaping, and climbing — and none of it ever feels extraneous to the story. McQuarrie favors long, unbroken takes, the better to show off that it’s usually Cruise himself and not a stuntman. In the chase scenes, the camera swoops in and out of Paris traffic in a way that made me fear for the camera operator’s life. While Ethan Hunt’s psychology is at issue, the film isn’t dour or introverted, though it does have fewer lighthearted touches (and cool gadgets) than Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation did. McQuarrie has found a way to bring the elements of the series together — despite each chapter having been conceived separately, with no master plan — and to provide satisfying resolution for the main character without adopting a grave tone. This would be an appropriate finale if the series ended now, but I suspect Cruise (who’s also the producer) has more ideas for how to nearly kill himself for our pleasure. I can’t wait!",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," There is story, of course; characters and conflicts are drawn from previous entries and daubed with droll economy; the banter is wry and sly with exposition and there are Tom Cruise’s customary issues and concerns. (Cruise is the job of work, after all). There is even modest acknowledgement that the long-running, ever-running movie star is a fifty-six-year-old man. What’s impressive and even rollicking about “Fallout” is the satisfaction of a film where the camera is in the right place, information belongs where it belongs, reversals reverse, needling dialogue needles nicely. The boinggggg of the extended pre-credits scene alone more honors the good and diverting moments of earlier implausible missions. “Tom has a very distinct sense of what ‘Mission’ is. He has a very distinct sense of what ‘Mission’ isn’t. And Tom communicates in emotional terms,” McQuarrie told fellow screenwriter John August on the “Scriptnotes” podcast. “He’s not a guy who comes in and says, no, you have to do this in a ‘Mission: Impossible‘ movie. In fact, the only thing you have to do in a ‘Mission: Impossible’ movie is Tom has to get a mission somewhere in the beginning of the movie. That trope is kind of the thing that differentiates ‘Mission: Impossible.’ That’s really his only rule.” Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year.

"Jul 27, 2018"," As the world readies for the release of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, a funny and astonishing bit of trivia is making the rounds online: Tom Cruise is six years older in the new action film than Wilford Brimley was when Brimley starred in the 1985 drama Cocoon. Partly, the meme trades off Brimley’s eternally grandfatherly looks, as the Quaker Oats spokesman was just 49 when cast against the more age-appropriate Jessica Tandy (75) and Don Ameche (76) in Ron Howard’s movie about senior citizens getting into extraterrestrial hijinks. But, mostly, the factually accurate joke underlines how, at age 56 (55 while filming), Tom Cruise is a physical specimen unto himself. When Cruise’s last Mission: Impossible film came out three years ago, I riffed that the actor was a living, breathing manifestation of pure determination. Exhausting himself to the brink in order to charm and seduce, Rogue Nation’s Tom Cruise is the platonic ideal of a movie star. In Fallout, that is still true. But Cruise is also now something of a next-generation human. He runs, jumps, dives and thrusts himself into the action with a delirious and insatiable glee – all while cocking his eyebrow, smirking and asking whether that’s all mortality’s got, huh? During the production of Fallout, Cruise should have died a dozen times over. Relying heavily on practical stunts (no green-screen technology here), the sixth film in the M:I franchise asks Cruise to leap from tall buildings, ride a speeding motorcycle through Paris without a helmet (against traffic), dangle from a helicopter before piloting it into a 360-degree barrel roll, and perform a high-altitude, low-opening 200-miles-per-hour free-fall jump from a moving plane 25,000 feet in the air. (That last feat took 106 takes.) That rave might sound familiar, probably from the last time a M:I film premiered. But Cruise and his death-defying co-conspirators have taken all that is remarkable about their improbable franchise – who would have seen the potential in exploiting a decades-old TV series starring Peter Graves? – and pushed it past any reasonable limit. Not only in style, but those funny things such as narrative and character, too – elements so often forgotten by modern CGI-heavy blow-'em-ups. Previous M:I films essentially started from scratch each time, ignoring any previous installments. Fallout not only acknowledges critical points in the series' history (especially M:I III), but uses the central villain from Rogue Nation to further up the stakes. As this new film opens, raspy anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is again bedeviling Cruise’s super-spy, the increasingly weary Ethan Hunt. The specifics of Lane’s plan aren’t really important – there’s not only one MacGuffin in the form of missing plutonium, but at least two more plot devices that may or may not make 100 per cent sense – but the threat is strong enough to push Hunt and his team (returning players Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Ferguson, plus Henry Cavill’s new CIA bruiser) to breaking points. Mostly, M:I films like to remind you that its heroes are having the time of their lives while saving the world. Here, the characters seem genuinely distressed – a slick reminder on the part of writer-director Christopher McQuarrie that explosions only matter if you’re invested in seeing who makes it out of the fire. McQuarrie, who also directed Rogue Nation and has written a number of Cruise features, is the only filmmaker who’s ever been invited back to helm a M:I sequel. (The series has already cycled through a mind-boggling amount of talent in the form of Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird.) As Fallout unfolds, it is exceedingly easy to see why Cruise and his fellow producers broke tradition. McQuarrie indulges his star’s unprecedented and maddening whims – sure, Tom, why not scale an elevator shaft like a hopped-up monkey, go for it! – but also ensures each middle-finger to Death is captured with extreme visual clarity. Unlike many of his action-cinema contemporaries, McQuarrie excels at creating clear lines of sight for his set pieces, and cutting them together to ensure maximum tension. We’re reasonably sure Hunt (and thus Cruise, though the distinction lessens with every movie) will live to see another day, but nearly all of Fallout’s 147 minutes force us to question that assumption. The action is engineered with such confidence and precision by McQuarrie that it is easy to forgive Fallout’s minor defects. Harris’s villain is more menacing this time around, but Lane still pales in comparison to Philip Seymour Hoffman’s sociopath from M:I III, still the series' high-water mark in terms of evil geniuses. Confounding, too, is how the CIA continues to distrust Hunt’s IMF (that’d stand for, um, “Impossible Mission Force”) team despite five films' worth of globe-saving derring-do. And where, exactly, is Jeremy Renner’s Brant? (Answer: The Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation actor faced a scheduling conflict with his Marvel work – a movie series that, stacked up against Fallout, looks like a sub-par Netflix original.) Any concerns, though, immediately disappear after witnessing Cruise scale a cliff in Norway, or pummel dozens of decades-younger henchmen in Paris, or execute a prisoner-extraction scene that reveals just how visually incomprehensible Christopher Nolan’s attempt at the same was in The Dark Knight. Add in a supporting cast that’s just as eager to match Cruise’s intensity – finally, someone has figured out how to properly exploit Cavill’s smarmy athleticism – and Fallout becomes the perfect summer crowd-pleaser. There is just one problem: What will producers (and possibly, hopefully McQuarrie) deliver for the inevitable follow-up? Just like Tom Cruise’s insurance provider, I’m terrified of the answer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Toward the end of Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, the director of the CIA says the following about superspy Ethan Hunt: “[He] is the living manifestation of destiny.” It is an absurd thing to say, and not just because it makes zero sense. Alec Baldwin plays the CIA director, and his famous delivery (half ironic, half dead- pan) cannot save the line. But if you pause and think for a moment, then the line works as subtext. As the CIA director, Baldwin is not really talking about Ethan Hunt. He is talking about Tom Cruise. Over the past 20 years and change, the Mission: Impossible franchise has shifted its purpose, while preserving the same spy thriller skeleton. The first few films reflected the sensibilities of their directors: the first two were directed by Brian De Palma and John Woo, respectively, and longtime fans could instantly recognize the staples of their work. In recent years, however, the films have favored outright spectacle. As Hunt, Cruise performs mind-boggling stunts, with each film looking more dangerous than the last. This is an actor who internalizes the idea that he is the manifestation of destiny. His films are now about getting the audience to agree with him. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the latest film in the franchise, and reunites Cruise with Christopher McQuarrie, who directed Cruise in Rogue Nation and Jack Reacher. Hunt’s objective—the one he always chooses to accept—is to recover some stolen plutonium from a deadly organization of terrorists. His mission takes him all over Europe, before Hunt and his team head into the Kashmir Mountains. There are the usual faces: Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Rebecca Ferguson, and Alec Baldwin follow the whims of an action star who is pushing 60. Henry Cavill is the most important new face, a mustached brute whose preferred method of overcoming an obstacle is to punch through it. It is strange, and ultimately refreshing, how unimportant the plot is to this film. It amounts to a series of action sequences—chases, fights, shootouts—peppered with breathless dialogue about who betrayed whom, and why. The actors are all convincing and forceful, while individual scenes barely withstand scrutiny: McQuarrie wrote The Usual Suspects, so he understands the specifics of betrayal. All these transitional moments, however, are in service of Tom Cruise’s next stunt. Like North by Northwest, McQuarrie and Cruise know what they want Hunt to do, and construct a movie around it. The first big chase happens in Paris. You may have seen action films like To Live and Die In L.A. or Ronin, where the hero has no choice but to drive into oncoming traffic. Cruise does that in Fallout, except on a motorcycle (without a helmet, naturally), and along the tight avenues of Paris. At every turn, even when Cruise goes the wrong way around the Arc de Triomphe, it’s always clear Cruise is driving. McQuarrie’s style is in service of Cruise, whose desire to thrill and entertain the audience is manic. This is an action film where the action star, not the director, is the true auteur. Cruise produced this film, and while he is not behind the camera, you can bet he approved every cut, every shot, and every transition. All this builds toward the climax in the Kashmir Mountains. It must be seen to be believed, preferably on the largest screen available. Cruise chases down the bad guy, who is escaping on a helicopter, and his only option is to hi-jack a second helicopter (there is a rope dangling beneath it). This means we watch Cruise climb the rope, pull himself into the cockpit, kill the men inside, and then begin the chase. All of this is completely convincing, and apparently Cruise learned how to fly just for this sequence. Combined with a ticking clock and the imposing mountainside, Fallout reaches absurd heights of suspense and entertainment. At a key point in the film, characters gather to heap praise unto Hunt. They say how he makes them feel safe, and how he is a credit to the world because he simultaneously thinks about the masses, as well as the individual. Once again, this fawning admiration is more for Cruise than it is for Hunt. In an age where the facsimile of spectacle can be produced via green screen, Cruise realizes there is no replacement for stunning vistas and genuine danger. You cannot begrudge Cruise for wanting every character to gush about how awesome he is. So many actors have an inflated sense of self-worth. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Tom Cruise is batshit crazy enough to earn it. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Jul 27, 2018"," A breathless, breakneck blast of pure summertime thrills, ""Mission: Impossible-Fallout"" is an action junkie's dream come true. Soak it in like a day at the beach, because big time blockbuster filmmaking is rarely this well executed or more satisfying.  Tom Cruise is back, looking awesome (does he age?) and risking his life for your entertainment as Ethan Hunt, the Impossible Missions Force superspy who's once again trying to save the world from a dastardly terrorist plot. This one involves some plutonium and the annihilation of millions of lives; in other words, it's a normal day at the office for Mr. Hunt. What it's really about is a smattering of masterfully executed action set pieces, and ""Fallout"" has some absolute stunners, meeting or exceeding the already high bar the series has set for itself. (To be fair, the dizzying Burj Khalifa sequence in ""Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol"" still stands as a series high point, but several ""Fallout"" sequences rival it.) Along for the ride are series regulars Ving Rhames (on board since the first ""Mission""), Simon Pegg (who joined the squad in ""3"") and Alec Baldwin (who debuted in ""5""). New to the fold are Angela Basset, who plays CIA director Erica Sloane, and Henry Cavill, the ""Superman"" brick wall who looks like a bulked up Armie Hammer, as CIA muscle whom Sloane assigns to tag along with Hunt. (Jeremy Renner, who was in the last two ""Missions,"" sits this one out, just as he was on the sidelines for ""Avengers: Infinity War."" Someone needs to get on the phone with his agent, just saying.) Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, a Cruise pal since he penned 2008's ""Valkyrie,"" has become Cruise's closest creative partner in recent years, writing the scripts for ""Edge of Tomorrow"" and ""The Mummy,"" and writing and directing ""Jack Reacher"" and 2015's ""Mission: Impossible-Ghost Protocol."" Here, McQuarrie's script delivers some delicious double and triple crosses; remember, this is the guy who won an Oscar for ""The Usual Suspects,"" so he knows a thing or two about pulling one over on an audience. Against the threat of nuclear Armageddon, Hunt skydives in a lightning storm, turns the streets of Paris into his personal motorcycle track, runs through most of London by foot (what would a Tom Cruise vehicle be without a heart-stopping scene of Cruise running?) and winds up in a helicopter chase through the Himalayas. The action is so riveting it excuses a standard issue climactic device involving a ticking bomb countdown, recurring references to something called a ""microwave transponder"" and cheese-dipped dialogue such as, ""the plutonium is still out there!"" Because with Cruise in full go-hard-or-go-home mode — the rooftop stunt where he broke several bones during production is included in the finished product — there's nothing to do but sit back in awe of a movie star going this far to please audiences. Dwayne Johnson, take note.  Since the first ""Mission,"" which Brian De Palma directed the living daylights out of, the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has been the smart moviegoers' popcorn franchise of choice. (The only dud in the series is John Woo's second installment.) ""Fallout"" — the longest ""Mission,"" at just under two and a half hours — not only lives up to its predecessors, it's one of the best action films in years, and it's still only the third best entry in the series (behind ""4"" and ""1,"" respectively). Bless this franchise, we're truly not worthy. ",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," Réquiem se refiere a la tradición de la misa católica, de los cantos, para pedir por el alma de una persona que ha muerto. La sexta película del agente Ethan Hunt bien pudo llamarse Misión Imposible 6: Réquiem y le habría quedado a la perfección. No me refiero en un sentido negativo, o que esta franquicia ya haya muerto. Christopher McQuarrie y Tom Cruise han entregado una película que ya no existe en Hollywood. El entretenimiento actual está lleno de efectos por computadora, villanos de cómic dispuestos a destruir el universo. Y, claro, Dwayne Johnson enfrentándose a la amenaza de la semana. Así sea ésta una bestias enormes, una jungla convertida en videojuego o un gran edificio en llamas. La película Misión Imposible 6 Repercusión es un canto al Hollywood que disfrutamos hasta finales del siglo XX, en donde la acción recaía en figuras como Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger y Silvester Stallone. Sus historias eran sumamente entretenidas y cargadas de acción. Pero siempre pecaban de un guion muy sencillo, plano o inverosímil.  Éste no es el caso de Misión imposible 6 Repercusión, en la que un estudio major (Paramount Pictures) le confió a un director repetir en la silla. Y no sólo eso, sino que es el responsable también de la historia. Ni Brian de Palma, ni John Woo, JJ Abrams o Brad Bird lo lograron, fue Christopher McQuarrie. En Misión Imposible 6 nos encontramos con un Tom Cruise en el punto más alto de su carrera como entretenedor. Está comprometido al 100% para entregar en cada cuadro de la película su rostro. No estamos ante una pantalla verde cuando él pilotea el helicóptero de la secuencia final (recordemos que él es piloto profesional). Sin olvidar el pie que se rompió al brincar de un edificio a otro durante la persecución en las calles de Londres. La película es en sí un réquiem que McQuarrie ofrece a todo ese cine que parece está muriendo. Un cine donde los grandes estudios confían en sus artistas, en sus creadores y les otorgan un gran presupuesto para lograr brillantes y emocionantes resultados. Un cine en el que existen esas superestrellas que atraen al público a ver sus películas. Sin importar la trama, siempre la estrella ofrece algo de una gran calidad.  El director logra coordinar una química en cada uno de los miembros de su reparto. Desde un villano frío y calculador, hasta una Rebecca Ferguson igual de enigmática y fuerte que en Nación Secreta. Además, la excelente dupla de Simon Pegg y Ving Rhames. Ésta sirve para aligerar la trama y una de las mejores interpretaciones de Henry Cavill como la contraparte de Tom Cruise. La película Misión Imposible 6 ofrece momentos de gran cinematografía para el formato IMAX. No sólo tenemos secuencias emocionantes, sino que se aprovecha el formato tal cual lo hacen los comprometidos con el celuloide. Como Quentin Tarantino o Christopher Nolan. El score corre a cargo de Lorne Balfe. A pesar de no contar con un sello propio, distinguible dentro de sus anteriores trabajos, con Repercusión entrega diversas secuencias que coquetean con el tema icónico de la serie de televisión. Pero las notas son alargadas gracias a los instrumentos de cuerdas y desarrollan un suspenso y acción mayores. Mientras hay franquicias que continúan entregando películas y siguen recaudando millones de dólares (Rápidos y Furiosos, Transformers), en cada entrega existe una debilidad argumental o son meramente vehículos de entretenimiento. Y no es que Misión Imposible 6 no sea un vehículo de entretenimiento. Pero el nivel de cuidado que Christopher McQuarrie logra con el guion es loable. Demuestra que es posible que un thriller de espionaje tenga clase y sea atrevido a la vez. Tom Cruise es de los pocos actores (si no es que el único) que se arriesga toma con toma por nuestro entretenimiento, por verlo arrojarse de un paracaídas, colgar del risco de una montaña o cualquier otra locura por lograr que se cumpla la misión. Al final Cruise es Ethan Hunt, a los dos no les importa arriesgar su vida para lograr su objetivo, para lograr la que parece ser una misión imposible.

"Jul 27, 2018"," More than two decades after moviegoers first chose to accept it, the series accomplishes if not the impossible then at least the highly unlikely by delivering more satisfying cinematic spy thrills in its sixth installment, “Fallout.” The follow-up to 2015’s “Rogue Nation,” also written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, finds superspy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his trusty Impossible Missions Force team – humorous techie Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and cool computer specialist Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) -- dealing with the fallout of their takedown of British agent-turned-baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), whose Apostles have scattered and become global terrorists for hire. Ethan and his team are tasked with intercepting three plutonium spheres before the Apostles can turn them into deadly nuclear bombs, but naturally, the mission goes horribly wrong. New CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) doesn’t trust Ethan or his boss, IMF Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), so she agrees to dispatch Ethan to recover the plutonium only if he is accompanied by her CIA bruiser August Walker (Henry Cavill). So, Ethan and Walker literally dive into Paris to meet with an elegant socialite and arms dealer known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Naturally, that also goes horribly wrong, but it reunites Ethan with former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own mission to carry out. She’s also obviously carrying a torch for Ethan, who is still tormented with guilt and fear for his erstwhile wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Per usual for the series, the ensemble is superb, and all of them are patently eager to play the spy game. McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning writer of “The Usual Suspects,” keeps the requisite plot twists, double crosses and complications bounding along, and if not all of them quite stick the landing, the next turn comes so quickly it’s hard to be too bothered. But what makes these missions impossibly exhilarating are the cannily devised and breathlessly executed action sequences, including a motorcycle race through the narrow streets of Paris, a bone-jarring three-man fist fight in a tony men’s room, and for a jaw-dropping finale, a risky helicopter chase through the Himalayas. The lion’s share of the credit for making these movies stalwart box office successes since 1996 goes to Cruise, 56, who not only brings his considerable charisma to the doggedly determined and decent Ethan Hunt but also his hard-won skills at and fortitude for doing his own stunt work. Cruise reportedly trained for a year to pull off the breath-stealing High Altitude, Low Opening skydive, and he broke his ankle jumping from one building to another for one of the many chase scenes and literally tried to walk it off. Also a producer on the series, Cruise, McQuarrie and Co. work hard with “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” to deliver some stunning action sequences that moviegoers have never seen before. Mission accomplished.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," Tom Cruise leaps to conquer yet again in Mission: Impossible Fallout, the third best in the series after the first film made in 1996, and Ghost Protocol, the fourth entry from 2011. Mission: Impossible Fallout is a determinedly old-fashioned action thriller that rarely stops to take a breath for fear that the loose ends of its twisted plot will be exposed. The always-on-the-go quality ensures momentum in a storyline stuffed with double blinds and dead ends. The action is superlative, the stunts justify the incredulity built into the very title, and the knowing banter builds upon the enduring question of whether lead character Ethan Hunt is even human. Played by Tom Cruise with unwavering focus and admirable energy since 1996, Ethan Hunt is both figure of admiration and single-point meme generator for the number of times the special agent has defeated death. Ethan’s other-worldliness, which overlaps with 56-year-old Cruise’s inability to act his age, and the character’s welcome lack of an inner life have rescued the franchise from fatigue and sentimentality ever so often. Every new Mission: Impossible film is a test of Cruise’s ability to push his body and the imagination of stunt designers to the limits. In Fallout, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise adds dangling from a helicopter, climbing a rockface despite grievous injuries, disrupting the traffic in Paris, and running across half of London to his lengthy list of death-defying feats. The helicopter sequence, supposedly set in Kashmir but actually playing out in New Zealand, comes at the end of a breathless but workmanlike hunt for a dirty bomb planted by anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Lane was captured in Rogue Nation (2015), and in Fallout, the sibilant-voiced villain becomes a prized asset to be fought over by Ethan and the other members of his Impossible Missions Force team (including Ving Rhames’s Luther and Simon Pegg’s Benji), Rebecca Ferguson’s British operative Ilsa, Central Intelligence Agency agent Walker (Henry Cavill) and the slinky arms dealer known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). The blank-faced and recently moustachioed Henry Cavill is just the man to gape at Ethan’s latest defiance of the laws of gravity. The busy plot even makes room for Ethan’s ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), whose safety is a recurring source of anxiety for the peripatetic field agent. That appears to be some finality in Julia’s new marital status and the meaningful looks exchanged between Ethan and Isla, but the climax suggests that Ethan Hunt still has a few mountains to scale and rivers to wade through. Onward, then.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Action junkies, rejoice. Mission: Impossible is back with what is arguably the best film in the series so far. Ethan Hunt, played by an older but oh-so-agile Tom Cruise, is still saving the world at 56, and you can look forward to heart-stopping stunts and a ticking-clock countdown that will likely have you clinging to your armrests. …Fallout finds the superspy and his cohorts (Ving Rhames-Simon Pegg) racing to retrieve three plutonium-powered nuclear devices before they destroy the planet. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie — who won an Oscar for the script of The Usual Suspects (1995) — does an incredible job injecting pace and minimising confusion in this sixth installment. His plot is sleek and thrilling.  Rob Hardy’s action-intensive cinematography helps immensely, as does the razor-sharp editing by Eddie Hamilton and the magic worked by stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood. Cruise continues to perform most of his own gravity- and logic-defying stunts and they are beautiful and terrifying to watch. Among the scenes that will have you gasping is a dramatic skirmish in the toilet of a Paris nightclub, a 25,000-ft skydive, and the extended climactic duel involving two airborne helicopters.  Returning characters include the former operative-turned-terrorist (Sean Harris), a beleaguered British agent (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunt’s ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan). New to the mix are Henry Cavill (as a CIA spook with an agenda of his own) and Vanessa Kirby, as a sultry arms dealer. ",POSITIVE

critic's rating: 



3.5/5

   Mission Impossible – Fallout follows the events of the last film, Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. The antagonist from that film, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), is at the centre of things once more. His followers want to bring in a nuclear apocalypse and have acquired rogue plutonium for that. They rig up two small nuclear devices to cause world class havoc. What's more, the bombs are connected to each other by radio so it's next to impossible to disarm them. But then, the word impossible holds a very different meaning for super covert operative Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise). He's assisted in his mission by usual suspects Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) and MI 6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who was shown to be both an ally and a romantic alliance of Hunt in Rogue Nation. He also gets a CIA minder, August Walker (Henry Cavill), who, in the words of CIA boss Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), is the hammer to Hunt's scalpel. Bassett gets another wonderful line in the film describing IMF agents as being,”a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat.” But it's this very clownish appeal that sets this franchise apart from Bond films or the Jason Bourne franchise. Instead of using brawn to bash up the baddies or using computers to spy on all and sundry, walking into the villain's den wearing a mask holds an old world charm. And please note that this time around Hunt doesn't do that but relies instead on his quick wit to stay alive. He's also shown to be hurting -- carrying scars and wounds like a badge of honour. Tom Cruise must be the fittest 56 year old around. He's forever running in the film, and jumping, and dangling off cliffs. Whether it's Paris, London or even Kashmir, every kind of terrain is mastered by his athletic abilities. He's as close to a superhero as he could be, coming close, but not crossing, the lines of implausibility. Tom Cruise has filled Ethan Hunt with vulnerability of late. Hunt does carry emotional scars -- parting ways with his wife at the end of MI:3 hasn't come easy and may be that's why he's blindly taking on increasingly suicidal missions, putting himself at risk at every corner. Hence, the car chases or the bike rides are that much more edgier, the parachute drops bordering on insane and the Parkour sequences getting more and more death defying. Hence, director Christopher McQuarrie cunningly reintroduces Hunt's ex-wife Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan) at a critical juncture in the film, allowing him emotional closure when he needs it most and infusing him with extra motivation in the bargain. The film, which is purely a series of action set pieces, gets much needed gravitas through this device. He also gets to have a guilt-free relationship with the other woman he cares about, MI6 agent Ilsa Faust, thereby paving the way for actress Rebecca Ferguson to act as Hunt's emotional anchor in future films. Henry Cavill may play Superman but has been reduced to playing a glorified extra in a Tom Cruise vehicle. The duo do have the best fight scene in the film, set in a loo, where both are bested in close combat by an enemy agent and are only able to subdue him by joining forces. Ving Rhames, as the reliable demolition expert, and Simon Pegg, as the back office guy trying his best to be a field agent are reliable as ever. The film has been shot well, cinematographer Rob Hardy has somehow put his camera in the middle of the action. Most of the scenes are shot with Ethan's point of view, lending a further involvement of the viewer in the film. The iconic theme music of the film has been given a masterful modern twist by composer Lorne Balfe. The action set pieces carry a whiff of nostalgia. The famous chase sequence from The French Connection has been cheekily set in Paris here and the climax involving the helicopter will remind viewers of the climax from Cliffhanger. “Your mission, should you choose to accept it…” is the catchphrase of the TV series on which the franchise is based on and has been successfully incorporated in the films as well. And till he is physically capable, Tom Cruise will continue to accept such films, be sure of that...

"Jul 27, 2018"," Tom Cruise's biggest competition seems to be himself. In ""Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol"" (2011), he astounded audiences by climbing the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, the tallest structure in the world. In ""Rogue Nation"" (2015), he hung from the side of a plane as it took off and held his breath for several excruciating minutes in an underwater scene. So what is he to do in ""Mission: Impossible — Fallout,"" the sixth installment of what has become the superior action film franchise running today? Unlike the previous movies, ""Fallout"" does not boast a signature stunt for audiences to dissect once the lights come up. That just isn't enough anymore. For this one, Cruise and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie — who also made ""Rogue Nation,"" meaning he is the first director to return to the series — have concocted a series of daredevil escapades, each one more insane than the last. And they're all handsomely filmed, in wider shots and longer takes than we're trained to expect. You can do that when you have a lunatic leading man like Cruise who insists on performing his own stunts. So yes, that's really him jumping out of a plane at 25,000 feet, and that's him on that motorcycle, without a helmet, speeding and zig-zagging through oncoming traffic. He even learned to fly a helicopter for this movie, taking to the air — solo, essentially working as actor, pilot and camera operator all at the same time  — to perform some perilous maneuvers. The adrenalizing quality of ""Fallout"" is unparalleled. You see, there's a sense of danger that simply cannot be replicated with a green screen. As entertaining as the Marvel movies are, it takes an awful lot — like the literal end of half the life in the universe, for example — to make us feel our heroes are in real jeopardy. But here in ""Fallout,"" Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is a flesh and blood man who's running, jumping and climbing on things that exist in our world, that existed on the sets — or in the air in some cases — where the scenes were filmed. At 56, Cruise is no spring chicken anymore, and the toll the constant exertion takes on him and Ethan is almost palpable. It's all in service to a twisty plot full of betrayals and double crosses that takes a hard look at the consequences — the ""fallout,"" if you will — of Ethan's world-saving heroics across the earlier movies and the often thorny relationship he's had with the government he ultimately serves. It's also the first film in the series that plays as a direct sequel to the one preceding it, with MI6 operative Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and the now imprisoned terrorist leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) returning. After Ethan uncharacteristically bungles an operation, there's stolen plutonium available to the highest bidder, and the CIA no longer trusts Ethan and his team — including series regulars Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) — to get the job done alone. Enter August Walker (Henry Cavill, sporting his infamous mustache), the agency's top assassin. Cavill, who's always carried himself on screen like a younger, buffer Cruise, is a perfect foil for the star, giving Ethan his most formidable adversary to date. McQuarrie expertly juggles the large cast, which also includes Angela Bassett as the new director of the CIA, Alec Baldwin as the new IMF head and Vanessa Kirby as a black market arms dealer. (Scheduling conflicts with the ""Avengers: Infinity War"" follow-up prevented Jeremy Renner from returning.) Delving deeper into Ethan's backstory humanizes him more than ever before, upping the emotional impact and investing us more in the action. Clocking in at nearly 2½ hours, ""Fallout"" never drags, never loses momentum. It is a spectacular piece of filmmaking, driven by a fearless star whose will to entertain knows no bounds. In this CGI age, you could say they don't make movies like ""Fallout"" anymore, but they never really did to begin with — not to this extent at least.

"Jul 27, 2018"," Mission Impossible: Fallout finds Ethan Hawke (Tom Cruise) and his team race against time after a mission went awry to stop a global catastrophe from happening.  I must admit, it’s been a while since I watched one of the Mission Impossible movies and, while everyone has told me they are good, I, however, never got around to watching the new incarnations of the film franchise.  Cruise in these films has damn near perfected his portrayal of our protagonist. Which makes sense, since he’s been playing Hawke for 10-plus years. It’s the spectacular cinematography, though, that makes the Mission Impossible movies special and a must-see at the cinema, with director Christopher McQuarrie giving both beautiful scenic scenes, as well as heart-racing action sequences.  This gives the director the ability to give the audience shots that otherwise would not be able to if he had heavily relied upon a stunt double.  The only weak link in the chain is Henry Cavill. Having mostly only seen him in the DCEU as Superman/Clark Kent, I gave Cavill the benefit of the doubt because the current state of things over there at the Warner Bros-owned comic book franchise is a hot mess.  Also in the Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Justice League scripts, they hadn’t given him much to work with in terms of character. However, in Mission Impossible, Cavill has the emotional range of a wax figure. His face barely changes and he gives no clear differentiation between anger, sadness and glee.  Cavill truly is a pretty face with very little range and he didn’t even take off his shirt. What’s the point of having that beautiful specimen of a man in a film, without showing him half naked? This, luckily, is the only negative in the film.  The rest is one fun ride at the cinema. It’s even better watching it at IMax, which really showcases the spectacular way in which this movie was a filmed. If there is an action movie to watch right now, then this is it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," EWTN News, Inc. is the world’s largest Catholic news organization, comprised of television, radio,
                print and digital media outlets, dedicated to reporting the truth in light of the Gospel and the
                Catholic Church. Mission: Impossible — Fallout completes possibly the most improbable cinematic hat trick in Hollywood history: An unpromising series that began with three patchy, uneven entries has now produced three terrifically entertaining ones. Mission: Impossible 4-6 is not the best trilogy ever, but surely no other sequel trilogy has so handily surpassed the original trilogy? I’m not convinced that Fallout, directed by Christopher McQuarrie, is better than its two immediate predecessors, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol or McQuarrie’s own Rogue Nation. Yet it not only feels of a piece with them, it ties them and, in some way, the series as a whole together. It feels both like a final chapter and a springboard for a new beginning. As different as they were, the first three Mission: Impossible films were all marked by three shared problems. First, colleagues came and went, Ving Rhames’ Luther Stickell being the only mainstay, but there was never a sense of an ensemble or a team — an Impossible Missions Force (IMF) — around Tom Cruise’s redoubtable Ethan Hunt. The filmmakers also repeatedly miscalculated how unpleasant or distasteful things could get while still being fun. (M:I II’s misogynistic mistreatment of Thandie Newton might be the low point here.) Finally, each of the first three films ended with Hunt ready to walk away from the IMF. It’s like neither he nor the series knew what they wanted to be when they grew up. If he didn’t care more than that, why should we? The new direction came with Ghost Protocol, which understood the franchise had always been at its best when it was a lark, and adjusted course accordingly. Rogue Nation and now Fallout continue this trajectory (McQuarrie is now the first director of more than one M:I movie). Taking advantage of Simon Pegg’s rising star, Ghost Protocol promoted his Benji Dunn from a minor deskbound role in M:I III to field agent and full-on comic-relief sidekick. Other players have now stuck around for more than one film: Jeremy Renner was in both Ghost Protocol and Rogue Nation, and Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin, introduced in Rogue Nation, are back in Fallout. But the trio of Cruise, Rhames and Pegg define the essential spirit of the new trilogy, of the IMF and hopefully of the series going forward. (Ferguson is a welcome presence, but she isn’t exactly on Ethan’s team, so the IMF still lacks a recurring female member.) Ghost Protocol also allowed Hunt to be more physically vulnerable, missing some of his action marks and occasionally getting knocked for a loop (for example, not quite making the final jump in the Burj Khalifa set piece). Like a stunned Indy sprawled at the feet of a German bruiser in Raiders or a panicky John McClane knocking his head on the underside of a table in Die Hard, Hunt’s susceptibility to a disorienting hit induces both winces and smiles, humanizing the hero and elevating the stakes. This is an easy balance to get wrong: This spring’s Tomb Raider beat up Alicia Vikander’s Lara Croft too much, inducing winces but not smiles. And in Skyscraper Dwayne Johnson theoretically has physical limitations, but he faces every challenge with stoic determination and an occasional quip. Finally, Ghost Protocol coalesced all of Cruise’s laser-like focus and determination into a definitive version of a hero for whom saving the world is not just the most important thing, but the only thing. Yes, Hunt married Michelle Monaghan’s nurse Julia in M:I III, but in retrospect, it seems that was a mistake; they can never be together, both for her sake and for everyone else’s. Like Superman, Hunt can never belong to one woman, because he belongs to the world. McQuarrie understands all this, and in Fallout offers the clearest vision yet of what the big-screen Mission: Impossible is all about. But McQuarrie is also a self-aware filmmaker who slyly critiqued the series in Rogue Nation, indicting Hunt as a “gambler” whose methods are “indistinguishable from chance” and whose successes look “suspiciously like luck.” This indictment was ironically validated in an underwater sequence in which Hunt had to randomly choose between two identical computer components. Then there was the ridiculously overdetermined finale about putting the villain “in a box,” which didn’t look like luck at all, unless you thought about it. Now in Fallout McQuarrie kids the excessive precision of his own finale, putting the IMF in one situation after another where they have no real plan. Like Indy going after the Ark of the Covenant, they’re making it up as they go — or, in Fallout’s signature line, they’re “working on it.” Since former CIA honcho Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), once an IMF Force skeptic, is now an IMF true believer, there’s a new skeptical CIA chief, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), with a new rap against Hunt and the IMF: not that they take too many chances, but that they aren’t cold-blooded enough. Hunley and Sloan agree on one thing: Ethan Hunt cares as much about one life as he does about millions of lives; to sacrifice the one for the sake of the many is all but unthinkable to him. But what Sloan sees as a weakness, Hunley sees as a strength. The issue is raised by an early stumble in which Hunt’s concern for a team member puts countless lives at risk. But it comes into sharp focus in a small aside in which a chance interloper is momentarily a cause of comic consternation before becoming the subject of a brief life-and-death crisis. What is one life in the grand scheme of things? To Hunt, collateral loss of life is never acceptable. Because of Sloan’s misgivings, Hunt is saddled with a CIA partner, a ruthless assassin named August Walker (the Man of Steel himself, Henry Cavill) with a reputation for shooting first and asking questions later. “You use a scalpel,” Sloan tells Hunley. “I prefer a hammer.” (The line implicitly contrasts Hunt with Daniel Craig’s 007, whom Judi Dench’s M likewise called a “blunt instrument” in Casino Royale.) Continuing the trajectory of the last two films, the villains are political radicals who believe a great global upheaval is necessary to usher in a better world. Sean Harris’ terrorist (or post-terrorist) mastermind Solomon Lane, who was just the right kind of creepy in Rogue Nation, is back, with a shadowy association called “The Apostles” in place of the Syndicate. (The name appears to have no deeper significance; there’s a brief but key plot point —mild spoiler warning — involving a scheme to target the most sacred cities of all three Abrahamic faiths.) Shout-outs to all three films of the first trilogy make Fallout a culmination of sorts. Michelle Monaghan’s Julia, briefly glimpsed at the end of Ghost Protocol, has a more substantial role here, and gets more dignity here than in past appearances. She’s also remarried, which I confess I didn’t expect, since I had assumed she and Hunt were still secretly married, even if they couldn’t be together. (Their love, the priest told them in M:I III, “is not to be diminished by difficult circumstances, and it is only to be dissolved by death.” Well, I guess there were good prima facie grounds for an annulment.) Meanwhile, Hunt is jumping out of a Boeing C-17 at 25,000 feet, a spectacular HALO (high-altitude, low-opening) parachute jump with astonishing aerial acrobatics at up to 200 mph, because of course he is. Not to mention climbing sheer cliff faces, speeding on a motorcycle against traffic in Paris, dangling by a rope from a helicopter and then piloting the helicopter in a harrowing chase sequence, and running and jumping across the rooftops of London. The technical challenges and rigors of the HALO jump probably make it the most impressive sequence in any M:I movie, although my favorite action sequence in this film might be a brilliantly choreographed fistfight pitting Hunt and Walker against a surprisingly formidable opponent. The growing rivalry between the two men is subverted as they find themselves battling with unexpected desperation for their lives. Why does it matter that the 56-year-old Cruise does all these stunts himself — and that he’s really hurtling toward the earth at 200 mph and not in a wind tunnel in front of a green screen with a CGI sky behind him? Why do we care that we can see it’s actually Harrison Ford, not an anonymous stunt double, dragging in the dust behind the Nazi truck? (I can’t stop referencing Raiders! This is a good sign.) Why are Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton so electrifying to watch? For that matter, why is Hugh Jackman doing his own singing and dancing more compelling than M:I’s own Rebecca Ferguson as Jenny Lynd lip-synching in The Greatest Showman? We know movies are pretend, but we also know that the imaginary events are built of bits and pieces of reality. A performer’s real talent and real effort in the service of the illusion draw us in. Our emotional connection to the character is strengthened by our awareness on one level or another of how hard the performer is working for our entertainment. Ego and publicity play a role, surely, but Cruise dangling from a helicopter or clinging to the edge of a cliff is also a gift: one I will appreciate as long as he is able to give it.

"Jul 27, 2018"," Your mission — should you choose to accept it — is to believe that a film franchise with a half-dozen movies can continue to depend on the action-packed heroics of a star who is in good standing with AARP. But just as Tom Cruise continues to defy Father Time, so too does “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” defy action-sequel logic that too often means more explosions and forced humor equaling a cash-grab. Cruise, as star and producer, and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (partners on the last film, “Rogue Nation,” as well as the perfection that is “Edge of Tomorrow”) are again in lock-step when it comes to what they want on the screen. Lead character Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his Impossible Missions Force, a super-secret agency of the U.S. government, are once again called upon to save the world, with success expected and failure not an option. As the team races against time to retrieve plutonium that a madman is planning to use to light three nukes — in the name of a “new world order” because the current leadership system is corrupted beyond redemption — that is essentially the entire plot. But while that may seem like small details, this is a big picture, and it depends less than ever on dialogue and more on staging one massive action set-piece after another. There are skydiving mishaps. There is a bathroom brawl that it hurts to watch as fixtures inflict so much pain. Helicopters go at each other like fighter planes. It’s all breathless, and most are staged with natural or architectural beauty in mind. Why stage a motorcycle chase in Paris if you’re not going to employ the Arch de Triomphe’s famous traffic circle? This is incredibly fun stuff but also a bit mindless, and if there’s a complaint, it’s that the series’ characters and stories are barely advanced. There’s a mission, and within it, there is deep cover, double-crosses, frame-ups and bad guys galore, and everybody seems to have an angle to play. Action is the film’s only personality until the final act, which finds a neat way to balance the presence of two Hunt-connected women in those portrayed by Rebecca Ferguson (so brilliant in “Rogue Nation” and with more physicality here) and Michelle Monaghan. As for the addition of Henry Cavill, the current Superman of DC movies with all the personality of a block of wood, you either like the acting style of his mountainous shoulders or you don’t. I’m not a fan. Not Cruise, mind you: He is the driving creative force that keeps this franchise ascending. Now, if we can just keep him in one piece.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," The newest Mission: Impossible movie lives up to its title with action scenes that are so spectacular—and preposterous—that it’s hard to know which ones to take seriously. Two highlights are an extended, white-knuckle car chase on the streets of Paris and much later, a helicopter pursuit. Yet Mission remains a piece of sheer escapism, even turning a lethal terrorist into just another movie bad-guy. With Tom Cruise in the lead and all the moviemaking knowhow on display, how can you go wrong? Here’s how: you can have too much of a good thing. That’s the problem with this fast-and-furious sequel written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie. Tom Cruise is fierce and charming as the occasion demands; he also performs death-defying stunts. And boy, can that guy run. His regular crew is back, with Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames filling their sidekick roles quite nicely. Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan, and Alec Baldwin lend solid support. Baldwin, as the U.S. Secretary of State, even has a fight scene! These characters are built on the shorthand Mission: Impossible has established in earlier installments. There are plenty of twists, but ultimately McQuarrie relies on our familiarity with the series and its central characters to tell his far-fetched story. This is what people refer to as perfect summer entertainment: big, long, splashy, and (overall) fun. Something you should see in a movie theater with the electricity of an audience.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," I can safely say that among the long running action franchises out there, “Mission Impossible” might just be my favorite. Not only has the series managed to re-invent itself time and time again, but Tom Cruise continues to impress and compel as series hero Ethan Hunt. He is a classic hero, a man who is bound to his work, or else the world literally falls apart at the seams. He’s a daring, bold, and clever force of nature, but he’s also one chained forever to the IMF, forced to confront not only terrorist threats, but the fall out of his past enemies that have come back to finally haunt him. Ethan Hunt is given a new mission from the IMF and is forced to work with the CIA and muscle bound assassin August Walker. Played brilliantly by Henry Cavil, Walker is the opposite of everything Hunt is. He’s blunt, big, faster, younger, and prefers to solve his problems with fisticuffs. The pair team up to take down arms dealer John Lark and a terrorist cell known as the Apostles who plan to detonate a nuclear attack on separate crucial locations. When the weapons disappear, Hunt and his team race against time to find them, and go to the edge ensure they’re not detonated, ultimately unleashing their nefarious plans for society. All the while Hunt’s relations with former allies are put in jeopardy when he uses a past foe as a bargaining tool for the Apostles. Christopher McQuarrie’s “Fallout” is the culmination of all the past films, as it combines breakneck balls to the wall action from parts two, three, and four, with the very mind bending twists and mysteries from parts one and five. “Fallout” is the sequel where Hunt has no choice but to rely on his group, even the shady August Walker, as the enemies they’re pitted against always seem to be one step ahead time and time again. “Fallout” feels a lot like a serial, not just chronicling the globe trotting adventures of the IMF, but also calling back a lot of the classic scenes from the previous films. There are so many great nods to the previous movies in the series that you’ll not only recognize them, but enjoy how much purpose they serve to the overall goal of saving the world. McQuarrie’s “Fallout” is one of the only movies in the series to date that feels like an actual sequel, where we get to see how Hunt’s actions and role in the IMF have affected everyone of his allies. McQuarrie embraces a lot of what has appealed to audiences in the past staging mesmerizing sequences like a nearly tragic Halo jump, a battle in a night club, an intense rooftop foot chase, and a mind blowing throw down in a bathroom (that I intend to watch over and over when the film is on Blu-Ray). “Fallout” is very much a spy movie, with a ton of great espionage and out there plot twists that will leave audiences struggling to beat the characters to the punch. As always the cast are on their A game, with Cruise as incredible as ever, while folks like Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, and Rebecca Ferguson are top notch. Henry Cavill is also excellent as Walker, a foil to Hunt, whose allegiances are always ambiguous. “Fallout” is easily the best entry in the “Mission: Impossible” series yet, and while a sequel is pretty much guaranteed, it’ll be a very tough to top this absolutely stellar installment. I haven’t always been on good terms with the “Mission: Impossible” series, but “Fallout” has guaranteed my attendance with future entries.",POSITIVE

Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. As summer franchise movies go, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is near the top of the heap. Pretty much a sequel to the previous movie in the series, “Rogue Nation,” it features Tom Cruise as globehopping Ethan Hunt in full calisthenic mode hanging from helicopters and cliffs, motoring madly through Parisian streets with police in hot pursuit, parachuting onto the roof of the Grand Palais – you name it. Whether Cruise actually does all his own stunts is beside the point. Has any other actor in his mid-50s persisted in this kind of workout, simulated or otherwise? The Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team is back, with Ving Rhames’s Luther and Simon Pegg’s Benji mouthing better-than-average spy movie dialogue as they attempt to track down a trio of plutonium cores before they get into the wrong hands and, you know, blow up the world. This plot, too, is kind of beside the point, which is probably just as well, since it doesn’t always make a lot of sense. The real attraction here are the players: Besides Cruise and the IMF team, there’s Henry Cavill’s appropriately named shady CIA operative August Walker; Ilsa Faust, a former MI6 operative sharply played by Rebecca Ferguson; and, best of all, the slinky black marketeer White Widow, played by Vanessa Kirby. From some angles, she resembles a sylph-like Lady Gaga. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives.

"Jul 27, 2018"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout is unique in several ways: it’s the first time a writer-director has done two consecutive IMF missions; it’s the first time an entry in the series is a direct sequel to the previous one; it’s the first entry in which its star suffered an injury severe enough for the film to take an eight-week hiatus, and it’s the second straight entry to feature a female character – Ilsa Faust – who is as good at her job as Ethan Hunt is at his. Fallout opens with the IMF team attempting to recover three stolen plutonium cores – and fail spectacularly when Ethan (Tom Cruise) and Benji (Simon Pegg) refuse to sacrifice Luther (Ving Rhames). Their mission to retrieve the cores is almost shut down by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) – who insures that her man, August Walker (Henry Cavill), accompanies them – despite the efforts of Secretary of Defense Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). (She prefers to wield a hammer over the IMF’s scalpel, and calls them Halloween, to boot.) For the rest of the movie, the IMF team and Walker attempt to recover the plutonium cores – the first time through a philanthropist/arms dealer known as the White Witch (Vanessa Kirby, The Crown). At odd intervals, Isla (Rebecca Ferguson) pops up to throw a spanner in the works – sometimes for the IMF team; sometimes for the other guys: a group who call themselves The Apostles and formed after Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) was carted away at the end of Rogue Nation. With the possibility of three 5-megaton bombs going off on a few key sites, Hunt and his team – and any other volunteers – has to retrieve them. But what you’ve come to see are the stunts! You want to see your boy Cruise jump across insane lengths to get from one building to another (one such stunt put Cruise in the hospital – and the shot was used in the movie! Every cast master is in top form – especially the returnees from Rogue Nation (Ferguson, still matching Cruise beat for beat and Lane even more despicable). In among all the spies working for the various agencies, John Lark – the right-hand person for handling arms deals and such a trusting individual that no one seems to know who he is. Anyone who’s listened to the Audio Commentary track on Rogue Nation knows that these films aren’t constructed in the usual manner – the screenwriter and the star try to figure out what stunts they haven’t done yet – and what variations they wont play on some of the best of the older gags. Once they have all the stunts planned; know where they’ll take place, and how they help to delineate the characters, then the script gets written.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," La traducción más común de Fallout hace referencia tanto a las consecuencias imprevisibles de cualquier catástrofe, natural o no, como a la corrosiva monotonía de la lluvia radiactiva. Y, en efecto, es exactamente ahí, en ese alboroto polisémico y mutante, donde McQuarrie coloca la segunda entrega con su firma de las seis que ya lleva Cruise como Ethan Hunt. Como en Nación secreta, la anterior, la idea es reconstruir la fiebre que provoca la certeza de lo inaudito, siempre en el límite entre lo muy improbable y lo poco verosímil. Ligada genéticamente con la lejana propuesta de John Woo, lo que importa es la fiebre, el frenesí, la pérdida del equilibrio. Es cine de acción grave a fuerza de negar las leyes más elementales de la gravedad. La idea básicamente consiste en situar a nuestros héroes ante la evidencia de su propia incompetencia. Se trata de que enmienden un error propio de consecuencias no por ajenas poco conocidas. Lo que sigue no es más que una carrera a ninguna parte feliz en la celebración del vacío. A su manera, y como siempre desde aquella primera película de Brian de Palma de 1996, la cinta recupera el rostro sin rostro (sólo máscara) del único héroe contemporáneo posible; un tipo sin identidad en pelea a brazo partido contra un enemigo multiforme, cambiante y tan despoblado de significado como él mismo. El mundo, sea París, Londres o Cachemira, no es más que el escenario de esa nueva y eterna catástrofe tan imprevisible como radiactiva. Y así, Fallout se antoja un refugio nuclear, laberíntico y muy seguro, contra el aburrimiento.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," The final 25 minutes or so of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the sixth movie in the Mission Impossible franchise, is some of the best action cinema ever put to film, full stop. We're talking Truck Chase from Raiders of the Lost Ark-level good. It starts big then just gets bigger until it smashes past all expectations. You don't know whether to gasp or laugh. (Why even choose?) Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt will not only save the world, he'll do it in the most ridiculously dangerous and flamboyant way possible, with a lot of glass flying all over the place. And in the last reel: that's really Tom Cruise! He blazed through 2,000 flight hours to become a licensed helicopter pilot. He was alone in the cockpit, with only the cameras as company. This is a next-level spectacle that doesn't just suspend disbelief -- it expels it. Moreover, M:I - Fallout was ""filmed for IMAX,"" which in this case means noticeable aspect ratio changes for the main action intercut with the B and C action. (Oh yeah, there's three different saving-the-world bits going on here.) Fallout isn't perfect. The lulls in between action set pieces are dangerous, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie wisely peppers them with goofs from Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is back, too, with abundant charisma, and newcomer August Walker (Henry Cavill) looks great in his larger-than-life mustache, despite there being something eerily plastic about Cavill; he never quite clicks. This is about as subjective as takes come, but I just don't buy him when he has to, you know, act. Luckily, much of his screen time is spent leaping from planes or beating the snot out an assassin. (A two-on-one bathroom brawl is undoubtedly the most muscular moment in any of the M:I films, with shattered tile, porcelain, and mirrored glass all vying for top billing.) Cavill's athleticism is nothing on Cruise's, though, and he invites us on two different travelogues. First, through Paris on a motorcycle; second, through London, on foot. (And on rooftops: One of the biggest laughs comes when Benjy realizes he needs to engage the Z-axis on his tracker if he's to follow Ethan Hunt!) So, why all this punching, leaping, zooming, and running? You had to ask, didn't you? As is often the case with M:I films, the plot is an inscrutable mishmash of crosses and double-crosses that probably makes sense if you whip out some graph paper, but who has time for that? (Has there ever been an Impossible Missions Force that wasn't riddled with moles?) I tell you this, in all honestly: it doesn't matter. Some baddies have stolen three nuclear reactors that look like giant Nespresso pods. Ethan Hunt, with the aid of the people he trusts, will get them back. No obstacle like physics or common sense or the natural exhaustion of the human body is going to stop him. In addition to Nespresso-nukes there's some other ridiculous tech. No rubber mask could ever look as good as they do in the Mission: Impossible movies, and those voice changer band-aids on the larynx just don't make sense. And how does a tiny bud buried deep in someone's ear canal pick up someone's voice? These guys can shout ""Watch your six!"" while dodging bullets and sound crystal clear. It's annoying -- at first. And then, you remember, it's a movie. And then you realize, it's actually the best mainstream movie of the summer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," When we first met Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt character, he was a brash young agent, filled with vigor and certainty, even as his world and his team were being murdered around him. Now, five installments later, Hunt seems a little worse for wear: He has nightmares about letting everyone down, especially his ex-wife, and he seems a bit less focused, even blindsided, from time to time. The fights hurt a lot more, as does the jumping out of buildings, which leave him with a temporary limp. Worse, early in this installment, he loses a huge payload of weapons-grade plutonium after choosing to save a team member rather than securing the cargo. He's flawed now, and uncharacteristically self-reflective, having finally lived long enough to realize his infallibility was term-limited. We have arrived at the sixth installment of this respectful franchise -- spread out over 22 years -- and, as with many relationships that continue for that amount of time, you can begin to see some fraying at the edges. Rather than the more standard four to six year lead-time between episodes, writer/director Christopher McQuarrie and his team produced this film in three short years, and one reason you can imagine for the sped-up production window is the age of its principal actors. Not just the venerable Cruise, who is, as ever, leaping off of buildings, climbing up vertical rock faces, and shimmying up a guide rope to an airborne helicopter at the tender age of 56; but also Ving Rhames (59) and Simon Pegg (48), none of whom are getting younger, and the energy of the series largely resides on the three of them -- plus, newly found love interest Rebecca Ferguson -- to carry it. Cruise has proved to be a Hollywood tank, able to keep trudging (or more accurately dead-sprinting) along, but without him and his commitment to the role of Ethan Hunt, the whole franchise collapses. There are other clues to the concept's vulnerability as well: With the exception of the second film, helmed by a seemingly listless and disinterested John Woo -- the M:I series has always gone the extra mile beyond the standard action pic. Not content to pack in a theater and give the crowd less than they were expecting, through various high-flying production teams (previous directors include such luminaries as Brian De Palma, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird), the films have endured because Cruise and Co. have always pushed the envelope, stuntwise, and with thick narrative conceits that somewhat belay their action-flick orientation. That is, until now. This film starts with a mishmash of previously employed plot points -- a group of rogue mercenary assassins stealing weapons-grade plutonium and negotiating the release and extraction of their fearless leader, with the IMF facing imminent dismissal, and Hunt himself the target of a frame-job that suggests he has finally turned against his country -- finds dissatisfying shortcuts to get its heroes to the fiery climax, and generally seems less inspired than the last trio of entries. If this installment lags behind the others, it's certainly not from lack of trying on Cruise's part. Regular readers have seen me harsh on some of Tom's choices, and his refusal to relinquish his grip on the high-concept action movie vehicle, of which he is perhaps the sole survivor, but give credit where it's due here: The man gets movies made, and his pledge to the M:I series, including the incredible practical stunt work he does almost entirely himself, is duly impressive. One of the major ways the series takes its viewers further than most big-budget action fare: It doesn't rely on green-screen magic to make it appear as if their stars are putting themselves at risk. Instead, the series has always put Cruise front and center of their harrowing stunt array.  Here alone, he conducts a high-speed motorcycle chase through the streets of Berlin, leaps from roof to roof over high-rise buildings in Paris, and, heartstoppingly, performs the aforementioned helicopter stunt, a bit that has him seemingly free-fall about 30 feet from the undercarriage of the bird before grabbing the guideline again -- as if to let us know they aren't messing about. (""I find it's best not to look,"" Pegg's character says of one of Hunt's escapades, a prerogative no doubt echoed from the film's producers and underwriter.) McQuarrie's film doesn't let down in the stunts department, but as far as a compelling story to hang all those well-crafted set pieces onto? That's where we run into serious trouble. Early in the film, Hunt is on track to acquire the stolen plutonium before he's forced to make a choice between saving someone from his own team, or letting them slip through his fingers. Choosing the latter, he earns a serious dressing down: IMF is referred to mockingly as ""Halloween,"" a bunch of men in rubber masks trying to fool everyone, by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), on whose authority Ethan is saddled with one of her agents, August Walker (Henry Cavill, replete with goon mustache), a ""hammer"" as she puts it. It's not long on their first mission together that Walker proves a clumsy, unexacting sort of fellow, which does not mix well with Hunt and his team of meticulous spy craftspeople. Nevertheless, Hunt manages to infiltrate the spy ring, making contact with the ""White Widow"" (Vanessa Kirby), who promises to make the connection with her seller, but only if Hunt, posing as an evil mastermind known only as John Lark, can help extract the evil former dictator Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the villain from Rogue Nation, and put him back in contact with his army of true-believers. Eventually, it comes to play that Lane, along with his operatives, have planned not only a massive nuclear upending of human civilization, but also his highly wrought plan to make Hunt almost entirely responsible for it, and the death of everyone he holds dear, as an elaborate revenge plot. Coddling together bits and pieces from M:I 3, and the last two films, McQuarrie has also taken elements from the recent Bond series, specifically Spectre, and come up with fairly thin plot gruel for us to swallow along with all those spectacular stunts. I guess it depends on what your expectations of these films might be: The action is, as always, formidable, but without the same care given to the storyline, the film is a good deal less satisfying than some of the predecessors. The opening and closing credits now play like a straight homage to the film's more humble TV roots -- with cast overlays in action segments, and a staccato cut of thrilling moments from the previous films. If what helped make the series feel special before -- it's event-like grandiosity and stunt-blasting outrageousness -- this feels ratcheted down a few notches, slowly winding down. At this point, Hunt has been exiled, betrayed, disavowed, and targeted for assassination, over and over again, all by his own government. As Walker suggests at one point to his boss, how much longer will Hunt be willing to jump out of planes, free climb impossible heights, and mad sprint through crowded European city streets before finally letting go?

"Jul 27, 2018"," There are eleven actors credited as “rowdy Frenchman” in Mission: Impossible – Fallout, and they all appear in a single bathroom. With abundant Frenchmen, a three-noun-two-punctuation-mark title, two love interests, several double-crosses, and three principal locations, the sixth movie in the Mission: Impossible series is a truly maximalist work of art. The plot is stupid but the stunts are terrifying, the tension vibratory, the muscles rippling. In short, it’s a masterpiece. That isn’t to say that it’s a subtle movie. The first post-title scene is pure exposition. That’s the great thing about those “your mission, should you choose to accept it” messages. They explain the entire premise of a movie, completely out of the blue, and events just play out from there. Three lumps of plutonium have gone missing, the tape message says. An arms dealer named John Lark and his global gang of evil thugs want to use them to bomb the Vatican, Jerusalem, and Mecca. They are equal-opportunity loathers of religion, keen to knock out all the Abrahamic hotspots at once. Our hero Ethan Hunt uncharacteristically bungles an interception of the plutonium lumps, however—and then the fun really begins. We get all the classic ingredients. Hunt has to apologize to mourners as he runs through the funeral of a loved one. He dangles from plunging helicopters. The rubbery masks make a great comeback, for once as part of a genuinely cool switch-up rather than a convenient plot twist.  The cast is a medley of old and new faces. The villain from Rogue Nation Solomon Lane (the eerie Sean Harris) crops up again, still hellbent on his mission to destroy Hunt and all he holds dear. Sidekicks Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) are still around, providing some crucial humor to pad Cruise’s muscle. New-ish love interest Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) gets to meet the old one Julia (Michelle Monaghan). When they stand next to each other it’s very clear that Ethan Hunt has a type. But the brand-new cast members are what distinguish this movie from its forebears. Whichever casting director thought to pair Angela Bassett and Henry Cavill as CIA director and her obedient, musclebound henchman deserves an Oscar. She is elegant and severe, sexy and dominant. He is gorgeous and huge, always wears a beautiful suit, and lives to do her bidding.  Their vaguely D/s relationship sets the tone of the movie, which is the most erotic of the franchise yet. The soundtrack gets a deep and languid treatment. And the much-trailered bathroom scene is one of the hottest things to grace the summer blockbuster screen in a long time. Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, and Liang Yang spend significant time in a bathroom stall together, which is what provokes the gang of Frenchmen. Gay sex, get it? In their time outside the stall, however, the trio just beat each other up in their expensive, well-cut suits. I could watch it for hours. It took a while to realize that Cruise was not only sort of attractive but totally credible as an action hero. He looks younger, if that’s possible, than he did in the last Mission: Impossible film. How is Tom Cruise doing this? His first appearance as Ethan Hunt was in 1996. To clarify, that’s 22 years ago. And here he is at 56 doing all his best moves: free-climbing a terrifying rock face, finessing a motorcycle, running extremely fast in his signature stiff-torso and scything-forearms style. Whatever work he’s had done is masterful. The man is a devotee of a maniacal cult that harms people, but it’s just so easy to forget that when his eyes fill with tears or he yells “I’m jumping out a window!” before jumping out of a window. In between his stunts, it’s hard to tell whether Cruise is really acting. In his defense the script is wobbly. When impersonating an evil terrorist, for example, he has to say “I murdered women and children with smallpox” as a conversational aside. But as I sat watching old Mission: Impossible movies in the office this week, my colleague Alex Shephard made an excellent point. Whenever Tom Cruise is being Tom Cruise, he’s outstanding. He can run and jump and kiss the girl with total plausibility. But when Tom Cruise has to be a regular guy, he comes across like a mannequin puppeteered by Brian De Palma.  The best example of this is the final scene of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol. The job is done and the gang comes together for a drink at a bar. Tom Cruise drinking a beer and saying “Go figure!” is just not something that should ever happen in a movie again. It’s so wooden as to be nearly inhuman. Director Christopher McQuarrie has amped up the hand-to-hand combat, the majestic outdoor scenes, and the gut-churning vertical drops. The movie takes place largely in Paris and London, where Hunt takes the opportunity to stroll the Tuileries and run frantically around the gallery of St. Paul’s Cathedral. But the final set piece plays out in Kashmir. I won’t spoil the way that cliffs and helicopters interact in that climactic section, but it’s very, very tense. I came out of the cinema with a gnawed notebook and weak knees. If there’s a politics to this movie, I couldn’t catch my breath long enough to figure it out. The terrorists are the bad guys, enemies of the “world order.” There’s something almost comforting about that lazy device. This isn’t the Cold War or a clash of civilizations. It’s a good guys-versus-bad guys punch-up. That’s not the way our world is threatened now: American foreign policy is a mess, and all the old geopolitical narratives are scattering into a chaos of late night tweets from the president. It feels good for things to make sense for an hour or two, to step out of the hot garbage summer into a cool, dark space that reminds us of 1996. It feels good to watch the world get saved, the old-fashioned way.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018",This is how Cruise returns to Zeus-level stardom. He gives his fans no stuntmen in masks and costumes. No green screen. Its him and he's spectacular.,POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," When a movie is as predictable as ""Mission: Impossible -- Fallout"" — or, for that matter, any other installment in the ""Mission: Impossible"" film series — perhaps the best way to review it is to break it down by the elements. As with the James Bond or Jason Bourne series, the entries in the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise are practically interchangeable, which perhaps contributes to the franchise's longevity. (Tom Cruise has played series protagonist Ethan Hunt since 1996, an impressive feat.) That also requires each individual film to be self-consciously formulaic in the process. Say what you will about ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" but at least its story took risks. ""Fallout"" offers a highly predictable form of fun -- although it's still fun. This ""Mission: Impossible"" story, like all ""Mission: Impossible"" stories, is simple at its core but contains enough twists and turns to be regarded as clever, although this narrative ingenuity is strictly limited to its storytelling mechanics. ""Fallout"" was written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who appears to be Cruise's thriller auteur of choice at the moment, having previously helmed ""Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation"" in 2015 and ""Jack Reacher"" in 2012. This time around, Cruise's Ethan Hunt must stop an unknown terrorist leader who goes by the pseudonym John Lark from wreaking havoc on the world, a mission our protagonist performs with the help of his loyal team members Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benjamin ""Benji"" Dunn (Simon Pegg), his boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) and a new team member named August Walker (Henry Cavill). In the process he encounters various characters from his past (i.e., previous ""Mission: Impossible"" films) including his wife Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan), former partner Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and emerging arch-nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). There is a lot to like about this plot, which unfolds in a way that makes our journey feel uncertain even if its destination is never in doubt. Most notable, of course, is the craftsmanship of the action sequences and stunts, with special props belonging to Cruise himself here. If you're a connoisseur of the action genre, you won't get better bang for your buck, whether from something as seemingly simple as a foot chase (for anyone who loves poking fun at how Cruise always seems to run in his movies, you'll have ample material here) or as elaborately choreographed as a deadly in-flight battle between two helicopters. Cruise's supporting cast is as charming as always, especially Rhames and Pegg, and they manage to transcend McQuarrie's dialogue, which is often more concerned with moving the plot machinery forward than with adding any distinctive flair to it. This movie is also entirely accessible, with a story you can easily follow whether you've seen every previous ""Mission: Impossible"" movie or have never heard of the franchise before. That is particularly refreshing in our pop-culture era, where half the fare playing at any given cineplex requires audiences to hold dissertation-level expertise in the convoluted mythology of some established or emerging cinematic universe. Perhaps the most intriguing dimension of ""Fallout"" is the moral dilemma it weaves throughout its story. When it comes to recent franchise pictures that focus on posing supposedly complex ethical or philosophical challenges for its heroes, ""Fallout"" falls somewhere between the high of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and the low of ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi."" It's interesting to see Hunt wrestle with the consequences (or, yes, fallout) of repeatedly refusing to sacrifice the lives of individuals in the name of the greater good. Whether it's beloved characters from previous movies or random civilians he encounters in this one, Hunt is the antithesis of Cavill's Superman from ""Man of Steel"" in that, instead of being shocking indifferent to death tolls, he cares too much about each human life. As the villain from ""Mission: Impossible II"" memorably put it, ""he'll no doubt engage in some acrobatic insanity before he'll risk harming a hair on a security guard's head."" The good thing about ""Fallout"" is that it explores this theme in a relatively intelligent way, unlike ""The Last Jedi""; on the other hand, there is never any doubt that things will work out in the end for Hunt, which is why it ranks slightly below a truly terrific pop film like ""Civil War."" This brings us to the biggest problem with ""Fallout,"" which is how doggone generic it is. Not only does this doom us to knowing from the get-go that Hunt will prevail and all potentially negative outcomes will be averted — a reality that drains every Tom Cruise movie of the suspense needed to prevent it from being boring — but it makes the other more routine aspects of the movie stand out even more. Worst among them are the villains: While critics have accurately pointed out that Thanos' evil Cosmo-Malthusian ideology in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" makes no sense, at least it was fueled by an idea more interesting than ""there cannot be peace without, first, a great suffering."" That's the kind of by-the-numbers villain rhetoric that is bland and forgettable except in the hands of truly iconic villains like Heath Ledger's Joker in ""The Dark Knight."" ""Fallout"" also suffers from the fact that too much of its plot depends upon contrivance. ""Mission: Impossible"" fans may say that's an irreplaceable feature of the series, rather than a bug. But can anyone really suspend disbelief when random character(s) arrive to save the day at just the right moment -- not once, not twice, but over and over again? Or when a grappling hook manages to land exactly where it needs to in order to prevent our hero's death, as if guided by the hand of God? Or when characters don't realize they've been had until the exact second they need to recognize that fact — not one second sooner or later — so that the next set of events can proceed as the three-act screenplay structure demands? I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention my discomfort in the fact that the ""Mission: Impossible"" series has, as one of its own primary missions, the goal of continuing the celebrity career of a man who spends his downtime helping to promote an extremely dubious religion. I'm not going to delve into all the ways the Church of Scientology is a disturbing organization, or why it's troubling that Cruise has not been held accountable for his work with Scientology even as other celebrities have fallen after the exposure of their various malevolent acts. Movie critics are supposed to leave such observations at the door when reviewing blockbuster entertainment; as long as the movie itself doesn't advance some nefarious agenda, we are meant to dismiss Cruise's presence in it as benign and harmless. But I'm not sure if any franchise that reinforces Cruise's status as a major Hollywood macher can be truly harmless, so I will just note that I feel personally uncomfortable about the guy, and believe I am not alone. I've referred several times to this year's biggest blockbuster, ""Avengers: Infinity War,"" and it's worth noting one other parallel between the two films. (Alert! Spoilers for both follow.) While ""Infinity War"" deserves credit for killing off a bunch of major characters in the end, that bold decision is undercut by our certain knowledge that several of those characters have pre-scheduled sequels which make it obvious that they won't stay dead. While ""Mission: Impossible -- Fallout"" doesn't have the surprises of an ""Infinity War,"" it also doesn't get bogged down in its pretensions, as so many cinematic-universe movies do these days. If you're a fan of this franchise, ""Fallout"" is a worthy addition. If you just want to see a fun action movie on a summer night, this will more than suffice.

"Jul 27, 2018"," The sixth film in the series opens with so much exposition you’ll think Tom Cruise’s stand-in wrote it on his iPad. A terrorist group dubbed The Apostles craves uranium to blast the world’s most vital religious sites to smithereens. Shake the planet like an Etch-a-Sketch and start all over again. And a baddie from the last “M:I” outing, Solomon Kane (Sean Harris), is helping make this nightmare a reality. Enter the IMF team – Ethan Hunt (Cruise), Luther (Ving Rhames), Benji (Simon Pegg) and their crusty boss (Alec Baldwin). They nearly grab a passel of uranium only to be thwarted at the last second. We soon meet old friends and new, from a towering fellow agent (Henry Cavill) to Hunt’s frenemy from “Rogue Nation,” Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa. Her unexplained connection to the chase is just one of several puzzles waiting to be solved. This is standard spy movie material, delivered with a high sheen thanks to writer/director Christopher McQuarrie. He’s in full charge of the franchise at this point, and his resources are impressive. Cruise’s Hunt is ageless, much like the 56-year-old actor in question. Cruise’s easy bond with his co-horts slices some of the simmering tension. It’s almost medicinal given the stakes at play. It’s all building toward the finale, a combo pack of set pieces showing movie magic at its finest. Sure, Cruise suffered a broken ankle doing some of his own stunts. That still can’t explain how his character dangles from helicopters, mountain sides and more. You’ll watch, and blink your eyes, and swear it’s Cruise doing all of the above. Modern FX are staggering in their authenticity. “Fallout” may be the finest example of just how far studios have come in this regard. Cavill is no one’s idea of a top-flight thespian. Still, his stoic nature is a snug fit for this franchise. And while no one is thinking the latest “M:I” affair is Oscar bait, the screenplay squeezes in enough dramatic elements to make us wholly invested in that runaway finale. “Teen Titans GO! To the Movies” offers more of the same. Joke after joke after joke, a good two-thirds requiring audiences grasp geek culture with both hands. If you’re on Team Nerd you’ll be in Nirvana for much of the film’s running time. Only by the third act will you exhale and wish the story had its screws tightened a few turns. Robin (Scott Menville) is green with envy, not a good look for a young crime fighter. He wants to be the star of his own blockbuster film like Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. Robin’s quest for big screen fame lights the fuse for a furious array of gags both big and tiny. Most land squarely, assuming you spent your teen years watching movies instead of double dating. Fans of the Cartoon Network series won’t be shocked by anything on the screen. The animation is similar enough to be familiar. The yuks come at us with that winning, wink-wink formula. And the inside jokes are lethal in their precision – perhaps mostly for the adults in the crowd. And yes, it’s exhausting all the same. The script hits variations on the same themes in the third act. We won’t spoil them here, but it’s hardly earth-shattering material. It’s clear the modest running time could have used a trim or two.

"Jul 27, 2018"," Fallout is not only (easily) the best pure action movie of Summer 2018, it's also the perfect culmination of the Mission: Impossible films thus far.  Mission: Impossible is the rare Hollywood franchise that seems to get better with every passing installment, in no small part thanks to star Tom Cruise's relentless willingness to place himself in mortal danger in new and inventive ways. That upward trend continues with Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the sixth entry in the series overall and the second written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie after 2015's Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. Fallout doesn't aspire to re-invent the wheel so much as it takes every trick in the Mission: Impossible playbook and combines them in a manner that feels creative and fresh. The results are a near-runaway success that delivers everything one expects from the Mission: Impossible brand, yet breaks its mold at the same time. Fallout is not only (easily) the best pure action movie of Summer 2018, it's also the perfect culmination of the Mission: Impossible films thus far.   Fallout picks up two years after the events of Rogue Nation. Former MI6 agent-turned criminal mastermind Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) is still imprisoned since being captured by Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team, yet The Syndicate - the global crime network that Lane founded - remains active and a radical faction of its members have rebranded themselves The Apostles. The group has set a terrible plan in motion that involves them acquiring three missing spheres of plutonium and using them to create nuclear bombs, in order to usher in a ""great suffering"". Thus, the IMF sends Ethan and his associates to buy the plutonium from a black market arms dealer, before The Apostles can get their hands on it.   However, when the mission goes sideways, Ethan is forced to make a hard choice and loses the plutonium in the process. IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) then sends Ethan and his crew to collect the plutonium from a more infamous dealer - known as The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) - but not before CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) intervenes and insists that her top assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) join Hunt's team on their operation. If that wasn't enough, Ethan must also contend with his former ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who's caught up in all this for her own mysterious reasons. With the clock ticking, it's up to Hunt and those whom he can trust to prevent The Apostles from carrying out their horrifying plans.   With Rogue Nation and several non-Mission: Impossible films starring Cruise under his belt, Fallout suggests McQuarrie now has a firm grip on how to blend crackling dialogue and labyrinth plots with high-octane thrills to create great action movie storytelling. At the same time, Fallout doesn't merely rehash Rogue Nation's approach from a screenwriting perspective and, because of that, ends up being the least episodic Mission: Impossible adventure yet (though it still largely works as a standalone movie). Fallout, as its subtitle indicates, instead addresses the consequences of Hunt's actions during not only Rogue Nation, but also earlier installments in the series - most notably, his decision to marry Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan) and briefly retire from the IMF in Mission: Impossible III. As such, Fallout has some proper thematic substance to go with the zig-zagging storyline and crazy action sequences that audiences have come to expect from the Mission: Impossible film series.   Speaking of which: Fallout does indeed have some of the most genuinely exhilarating set pieces and terrifying action scenes featured in a modern studio release, including several white-knuckle moments where viewers may find themselves genuinely worried that Cruise is going to die onscreen. Because the actor performs most of his own stunts, this makes it easier for cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation) and editor Eddie Hamilton (back from Rogue Nation) to shoot and construct the film's spectacle in a cohesive fashion that isn't hamstrung by jagged camerawork and hyperkinetic editing meant to disguise when it's an actor handling the action and when it's a stunt performer. No two sequences are shot the same way either; which, in combination with the beautifully photographed backdrops from around the world (the UK, Paris, Norway, United Arab Emirates) and an exciting score by Lorne Balfe (Pacific Rim Uprising), further allows Fallout to deliver the goods simply as a globe-hopping thrill ride.   It helps that Fallout makes nice use of its ensemble and gives most everyone in the cast something worthwhile to do, as far as the story is concerned. Cruise and Monaghan are both afforded some welcome dramatic moments here, as are Baldwin, Harris, and (in a pleasant surprise) even Ving Rhames, back again as Ethan's tech guru, Luther Stickwell. Fallout is similarly effective in the way its uses Simon Pegg's Benji Dunn as both comedic relief and capable IMF field agent - giving him room to further evolve in his fourth movie appearance - and provides Ferguson as Ilsa with a real arc, allowing her to both kick butt and develop as a character. Likewise, Bassett and Kirby are equally charismatic in their smaller roles here as two very different, yet ruthless and smart people who know how to play their cloak-and-dagger games well. And last, but not least, Cavill's Agent Walker is a strong foil to Cruise's Ethan Hunt that lets the actor (and, yes, his mustache) riff on his image as Superman in the DC Films franchise.   Interestingly enough, Fallout is also the first Mission: Impossible movie that really has something to say about the state of things in the world today. The film quietly, yet firmly, rejects the cynicism and nihilism that Lane and The Apostles subscribe to, and instead champions Hunt and his team for valuing every individual life and having faith in others, no matter how terrible the world gets around them. Admittedly, this does make some of the movie's bigger twists easier to predict, yet Fallout actually uses that to its advantage (rather than trying to present the twists as being major rug pulls). This, in turn, gives the film some real heart and a sense of purpose, and makes it more than just an excuse for Cruise to jump out of planes, fly helicopters, or whatever else strikes his fancy.   The short of it? Mission: Impossible - Fallout lives up to the early hype of being the best action movie of this summer and may yet become many fans' favorite Mission: Impossible film overall. It further delivers as a blockbuster experience - one that should definitely be enjoyed in IMAX if possible - for casual fans of the series and offers some fun payoffs for those who have closely followed the franchise over the past 22 years (see also: the subtle connection between a certain supporting character featured here and the villain in the first Mission: Impossible film). Be this your sixth Mission or maybe even your first, you should definitely accept it.   Mission: Impossible - Fallout is now playing in U.S. theaters nationwide. It is 147 minutes long and is rated PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language.  The LEGO Group has released five new Star Wars sets for March 1st, celebrating the toy company's 25th anniversary with the galaxy far, far away. The Bikeriders is already similar to a 16-year-old TV show, but after a new trailer, this TV show might have already spoiled the movie's ending. The Matrix is rightly considered one of the most influential sci-fi action movies of all time, but some aspects of the film haven't held up.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," It started with a NOC list. Back in 1996, under the direction of Brian De Palma, Tom Cruise assumed the role of shadowy spy Ethan Hunt. Then Hunt became the de facto leader of the comically named Impossible Missions Force (the “IMF”), a fictional espionage agency that does things other organizations wouldn’t think possible. And when his boss, Jim Phelps (Jon Voight), and most of his team are killed in a shocking opening sequence, Hunt goes rogue. Of course, students of the franchise, know the formula, and going rogue is just part of the playbook, in which people rarely stay dead in the “Impossible” universe. Flash forward 22 years later, Hunt is firmly in charge of the IMF, an on again/off again savior of the free world. And the concept of NOC, or agents under non-official cover, is in full-force and effect. I guess Hunt and his team don’t draw government paychecks and can’t count on Social Security as they grow older. In fact, at 56 years old, the age of Cruise the actor and the approximate age of his character, Hunt should probably start thinking about putting a little away, because his salad days are long gone. But before Hunt leaves the employ of the IMF, he’s got another mission to accomplish, and, yes, it’s a darned impossible one. After taking delivery of a self-destructing video, in which we learn that a new villainous organization is in the market for nuclear materials in order to build three bombs, the IMF team is assembled to stop them. The stripped down team consists of Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and, of course, Hunt. When the threesome lose the nuclear material in a deal gone bad, they have to hatch an impossibly complex plan to infiltrate this new doomsday organization that’s hell-bent on exploding nukes to reshape the world. But the US Government isn’t sold on the IMF, and CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) embeds the beefy August Walker (Henry Cavill) into the team over the objections of IMF’s administrator Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). There’s a lot more plot after that: Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) drives back into the picture; a new alluring black marketeer named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) is introduced; and Hunt must battle inner demons while having to deal with killer/terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). The story is dense and we get loads of fast-paced exposition that almost matches the action that eventually takes over. I’d call the narrative complete nonsense, but even after watching the film closely, I have no complete grasp of it all. There’s a lot of story, back-story, relationships, characters, and entanglements that are thrown at the viewer at a dizzying pace. Credit goes to writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, who really goes flat-out here both in writing the spy material and building convincing action sequences. For example, there’s a fight scene in a bathroom that is alone worth your money. It rivals the bathhouse sequence in Cronenberg’s “Eastern Promises,” while reminding us of the tongue-in-cheek fun that pushed Cameron’s “True Lies” gleefully forward. McQuarrie and Cruise, who have worked together for years now, know how to bring it, but aren’t averse to injecting humor when it matters. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is a propulsive viewing experience, captured at a true break-neck pace, even if the story is impossibly foolish. Cruise gets a lot of the credit as he reportedly does most of his own stunts, many of the best ones take place on a motorcycle. The action seems very authentic and even intimate, as the camera is so tightly connected to Cruise, precisely because he is actually on the bike. And the film never really gives you a breather, as the closing sequence is a real stunner.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Ethan Hunt never makes things look easy. Whether he's dangling in a hardness from a cord, catching his beads of sweat, leaping across skyscraper tops or jump-kicking his way through helicopter windows, he tends to take the tougher route whenever possible. Like a wide receiver who stutter-steps just so he can dive to catch a pass or a baserunner who unnecessarily dives into a base, the iconic agent played countless times by Tom Cruise would rather make things look good than easy. Cruise certainly puts the ""fall"" into ""Mission: Impossible Fallout,"" tumbling through the overly complicated globe-skipping action flick as though he's collecting punches on the Break A Bone On Every Continent Rewards Card. Outrageous, dumb and silly at every turn, it's just the breezy summer romp that fans of this sort of stuff desire. What's most important is that Cruise and his fellow castmembers seem to be having fun, even though the stuff that they're dealing with is purportedly serious.  Sure, Ethan, his reluctant partner, Superman With a Mustache (Henry Cavill) and sidekicks played by Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are tenaciously trying to stop terrorists from nuking Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca, but they go at it with the joyful vigor of buddies working a shopping mall escape room.  As they shout at one another, tear off latex masks, shoot faceless baddies and track down stolen equipment, they eye one another with the understanding that afterward they will go pick up a lemonade and Cinnabon. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who has become Cruise's go-to director over the period of two films each in the ""Mission: Impossible"" and ""Jack Reacher"" franchises, orders his actors and effects maestros around with the whimsy of an 8-year-old playing Legos. No moment is dull, neither is one comprehensible.  The point is not to solve the problems the characters face, but to add more and more excuses for them to race around in exotic locales and punch enemies through bathroom walls. Comparing the new movie to the others in the ""Mission: Impossible"" oeuvre is impossible, because they are collectively such a blur that the truly impossible mission is to remember who did what in which film. That's just as well, because the formula remains static.  Ethan is always double-crossed by his bosses and those he considers allies, but always smarter and tougher enough than those who wrong them so he can end up with the upper hand. You get the feeling that if Ethan wasn't betrayed, he would sulk in the corner, disappointed that he has nothing to do other than play Candy Crush. Like agents who cash paychecks from both the black and white hats, ""Mission: Impossible Fallout"" works double duty. Those who take it deadly serious will flinch and lean forward when called upon to do so. Those who want to laugh at the absurdity of it all will go with friends and chuckle their way through.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to keep going to these things until Cruise gets tired of making them. Judging from the exuberance in this outing, that day isn't coming any time soon. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Is the technology overused in modern blockbusters? Oh, heck yeah. But with Hollywood relying on computer-generated imagery to create everything from locations to costumes, it’s almost silly for Cruise to keep finding new and more elaborate ways of risking his life, hundreds of times per film, simply to provide thrills that many moviegoers assume were faked anyway.  For “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” alone, Cruise sped around Paris’ Arc de Triomphe on a motorcycle, against traffic, without a helmet. He learned to fly a helicopter at low altitudes and make it perform spirals for a chase scene. Then there was the absurdly complicated parachute jump from 25,000 feet that he told attendees of April’s CinemaCon at Caesars Palace he completed 106 times, following a year of preparation, for just three usable takes. Anyway, “Fallout” is the first direct sequel in the franchise. Think of it as the “Quantum of Solace” to “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation’s” “Casino Royale.” The major difference being “Fallout” never feels like a letdown. In the years since Hunt and the Impossible Missions Force captured “Rogue Nation” baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), his former operatives have regrouped as The Apostles and are in the process of acquiring enough stolen plutonium to arm three nuclear warheads with the intent of unleashing them in the most destructive ways possible.  In addition to Lane, “Fallout” marks a return for Ethan’s allies Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and new IMF boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin). Enigmatic former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is back as well, as is Ethan’s wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Following “Avengers: Infinity War,” this is the summer’s second blockbuster to completely forget about Jeremy Renner. But the IMF’s reliance on masks and trickery causes new CIA Director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) to intervene. Having no patience for their Halloween-style high jinks, Sloane insists her best assassin, August Walker (Henry Cavill), stick to Ethan until the plutonium is recovered. Wherever Ethan goes, Walker goes. And wherever Walker goes, The Mustache That Helped Ruin “Justice League” goes. (For the uninitiated, Cavill was needed for “Justice League” reshoots while filming “Fallout.” When he was forbidden to shave his Walker mustache, the facial fuzz had to be digitally removed, often distractingly, in ways that gave Cavill’s Superman a goofy-looking upper lip.) That ’stache is far from the only eye-catching scenery in “Fallout,” which bounces from Belfast to Berlin to the streets of Paris. Honestly, the way the action scenes are presented by returning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, I’d be up for two hours of nothing more than Cruise tearing through the streets of the City of Lights on a motorcycle, accompanied by “Fallout’s” blaring score, squealing tires and the revving engine that sounds as though there’s a microphone affixed to the crankshaft. Those scenes are just a part of the spectacle of “Fallout,” which manages to make moviegoers feel as though they’re inside the movie — right down to the motion sickness — in ways even those moving seats rarely can. Along those lines, if you’re ever given just 15 minutes to live, pray for the countdown clock used here. You could accomplish a lifetime of thrills based on that time table. Not to mention several lifetime’s worth of death-defying stunts. Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be in place for the start of the rollout on Tuesday, a day that British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II. Construction of the new Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall is 95 percent complete and on track for a Dec. 14 completion with workers doing finishing work now. Stocks dropped suddenly on Wall Street Tuesday afternoon after President Donald Trump ordered a stop to negotiations with Democrats over another round of stimulus for the economy. Even if you’re lucky enough to still have your mother, and have a good relationship with her, there’s a very real probability you won’t see her this year. Smart & Final, 99 Ranch Market and Costco are requiring face coverings for employees and customers, and limiting the number of people in a party.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," In the “Mission: Impossible” movies, “We’re working on it” has become a recurring joke the way “I’ve got a bad feeling about this” has in the “Star Wars” movies. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his team are constantly flying (or, more often, falling) by the seat of their pants, improvising and scheming their way out of one dire situation after another at the last second. Which is ironic, because every “Mission: Impossible” movie bears the marks of high-level precision and planning, with incredible stunts, gorgeous filmmaking and delightfully knotty plots that double cross the audience as much as the characters. You can feel the care and craftsmanship in every scene, like when you eat a fancy meal or drive an expensive car. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is the crowning achievement of the franchise, a relentlessly inventive and entertaining action movie. It’s a little darker thematically than the last two films, “Rogue Nation” and “Ghost Protocol,” with a little less of that fun “let’s pull off a caper” energy that was a hallmark of the original TV show. Lalo Schifrin’s iconic theme song even sounds a little more somber here. But the film is nonstop exhilaration, a fluid, fast-moving series of chases and escapes and showdowns, all executed near flawlessly. And Cruise put himself in harm’s way so often while making the movie (he broke his ankle during production jumping from one roof to another) that it seems almost rude not to enjoy it. For a film that’s so much fun, “Fallout” gets off to a moody start. Hunt has the weight of the world on his shoulders, plagued by nightmares in which he’s unable to protect his ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) from the villains of the world, like his old “Rogue Nation” nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). His fears prove to be founded. In the next scene, Hunt and his sidekicks Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) botch an attempt to buy black-market plutonium that a terrorist group called The Apostles want to get their hands on. The Apostles are rogue secret agents who were members of The Syndicate, the organization led by Lane in “Rogue Nation.” Hunt lost the plutonium because he wasn’t willing to sacrifice Luther and Benji to get it, which makes him a softie in the eyes of CIA chief Sloan (Angela Bassett) and her top man, the ruthless Agent Walker (Henry Cavill). They’d rather just kill everybody and sort it out later. With Walker as a unwilling partner, Hunt goes after the plutonium. That he’s trying to rectify a past mistake gives this mission a poignant urgency. Casting the imposing Cavill, a literal Superman, turns Cruise into an unlikely underdog by comparison, with Hunt looking older and wearier next to the newer model, and we root for him. I don’t think I’ve ever identified more with a Tom Cruise character than when Hunt takes a nap in the middle of one mission. We feel every punch Hunt takes, and when he jumps off of the side of a building, we go over with him. And he jumps a lot. There are so many action scenes in the movie that Buzzfeed ought to do a “Which Fallout Action Scene Are You?” quiz. From a stomach-churning parachute drop over Paris to a wild vehicle chase through its streets, from a kinetic foot chase over London rooftops to a helicopter battle over Kashmir, “Fallout” never lets up. The sequences are masterful, beautifully shot by cinematographer Rob Hardy (it's worth the IMAX surcharge) and edited by Eddie Hamilton, with director Christopher McQuarrie always making sure the viewer knows what’s going on moment to moment. The supporting cast, including Rebecca Ferguson as MI6 agent Ilsa Faust and Alec Baldwin as the IMF chief Hunley, each get their moments to shine (although Jeremy Renner's absence is never explained). I especially enjoyed a couple of tender moments by the burly Rhames, and the film convincingly conveys that Hunt cares for this superspy family and is devoted to protecting them. And, if you're a ""M:I"" fan who lives for those moments when a character takes off a rubber mask to reveal their real identity, you won't be disappointed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," In the opening moments of the 2.5-hour Mission: Impossible — Fallout, producer/stuntman/star Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt shares a tender moment with Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan), the woman for whom he tried to retire from the impossible mission business 12 years and three movies ago, and who's rated only a silent cameo since. Our Man Hunt's reverie is swiftly ended with the arrival of yet another soon-to-self-destruct assignment. This one comes in a hollowed-out book concealing an antique reel-to-reel tape recorder. With those two elements, the the most enrapturing plainclothes action flick since the previous Mission: Impossible three years ago is calling its shot. They promise that Fallout shall 1) attend to the continuity of the six-film series in a way its predecessors seldom have, and 2) honor the longstanding Mission tradition of achieving its stunts and giving us our kicks the hard way. The analog way. The more dangerous and exponentially more exciting way.  Digital animation will almost certainly advance to a point where it becomes indistinguishable from photography of physical performance in the physical world — or in the case of the grandest of Fallout's half-dozen Olympian set pieces, 25,000 feet above the Earth. (This high-altitude, low-opening parachute dive into Paris is easily the most vertiginous movie stunt ever, requiring more than 100 twilight dives to capture.) When that day comes, we'll have bigger problems than that our popcorn movies will be less exciting. But it's not here yet, and the way Fallout's sky-high thrill quotient obliterates that of all competitors makes you grateful that action cinema is still something of a meritocracy. There are viewers to whom it will not matter that Cruise — who turned 55 while Fallout was shooting — did his own motorcycle racing and building-leaping (you can see him shatter his ankle for real in this movie, you sicko) and HALO jumping and helicopter flying (!!!). Look, I am not especially troubled that Marni Nixon overdubbed Audrey Hepburn's singing in My Fair Lady. (Nixon should've been credited, though.) It's certainly odd that a three-time Academy-Award-nominee who's worked with the likes of Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola and Oliver Stone and Stanley Kubrick and Paul Thomas Anderson waited until his mid-40s to become virtually a full-time DIY action star, as much athlete as an actor. But to dismiss his seeming death wish is to undervalue a Buster Keaton/Gene Kelly/Jackie Chan-level entertainer. Who cares if we no longer buy him as an ordinary human being? We've got plenty of those.  This series, which began in 1996 with a Brian De Palma-directed entry that more resembled the paranoid thrillers of the 1970s than it did contemporaneous blockbusters like Twister and Independence Day, has always relied at least as much on Cruise's taste as a producer and cinephile as on his star power. Once audiences began to signal that weren't interested in him as a romantic lead, Cruise responded by quietly accepting this verdict and then tapping Brad Bird, who'd never made a live action film, to renew the series with 2011's Ghost Protocol. That became the new template for the series, bringing a new commitment to verisimilitude and spectacle — Cruise's shot-in-IMAX outdoor walkabout to the 130th floor of the Burj Khalifa stands as one of the all-time great movie stunts — and a greater emphasis on the rotating co-stars, particularly Simon Pegg's IT-guy-turned-field agent Benji Dunn. Late-period Cruise does the opposite of what most actors do: He outsources the ""relatability"" skillset but handles the life-threatening stuff himself. Fallout is the dizzy culmination of all that. In venerable spy franchise terms, it's the movie Spectre wanted to be: A direct follow-up in a series more known for one-and-dones, and a self-aware legacy-quel that tips its hat to the past while trying to enrich its oft-inscrutable hero's inner life.  Frankly, I always liked that Ethan Hunt was something of a unknowable zealot, defined only by pursuit. (The only lasting benefit John Woo's M:I-2 brought to the franchise was showing us that this nut's idea of a vacation was to climb a mountain sans rope.) I was never going to care about his marriage the way I want the rocky partnership of John McClane and Holly Gennaro to work out. The latter installments showed Hunt increasingly succumbing to the sort of bug-eyed mania audiences had begun to ascribe to Cruise in real life, and to approach his feats of derring-do with more trepidation than cockiness. These tweaks improved the films substantially. Christopher McQuarrie, the first director to return for a second Mission, has grown as a visual storyteller since he made the terrific Rogue Nation, but he's still a writer first, the guy who won an Oscar for the screenplay of The Usual Suspects, and who made uncredited rewrites on Ghost Protocol and Edge of Tomorrow, both first-rate Cruises. Even when all he's doing is stitching the set pieces together into a occasionally befuddling web of counter-betrayals and mask-reveals, he's adding value. I wish he could've cut down the Cruiseplaining just a little, but maybe that's the cost of doing business. The setup this time is that Hunt's squad lets three plutonium cores fall into the hands of black marketeers, who also want to secure the release of the terrorist mastermind I keep wanting to call Nathan Lane. (His name is Solomon Lane.) He's the guy the IMF trapped in a box at the end of Rogue Nation. He's played by Sean Harris, who looks like a hybrid of Cruise and Pegg, a resemblance Fallout occasionally uses to its advantage. Even better, Rebecca Ferguson has returned for M:I-6 as MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust. She lives up to her name.  Because it was Hunt's sentimental refusal to sacrifice Ving Rhames's Luther Strickwell, the series' longest-serving second banana, that lost the plutonium to begin with, new C.I.A. director Angela Bassett orders legbreaker Henry Cavill, who turns out is at least a good a bad guy as he is a super-good guy, to accompany Hunt's team. Walker doesn't share Hunt's quaint commitment to minimizing the body count. Their dynamic is established in the one-two of the aforementioned para-jump, immediately followed by a showstopping melee in a nightclub washroom. Cavill is basically the Casino Royale-era Daniel Craig 007 here, a ""blunt instrument"" who prefers force to finesse. (That's a nice Easter egg for fans of this genre, who may know that a very young Cavill was one of the finalists under consideration when Craig was cast as Bond.) This most intimate of the film's many set pieces shows us in miniature what the Mission series possesses that others do not. There's world-class fight choreography, sure, and topnotch physical performances from Cruise and Cavill and, in that epic bathroom dust-up, Liang Yang. But, between them, there are rests. There are changes in tempo. There are opportunities for the audience to catch its breath before the action resumes. McQuarrie never forgets the stakes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," So let's hear it for Christopher McQuarrie, writer-director of the latest Mission: Impossible film, who has finessed the fresh-plot problem by basically laughing in its face. Oh, there's lots going on in this movie – and there are lots of places that it's going on in (London, Paris and Berlin, of course—but Kashmir, too!). However, keeping track of all the narrative permutations—the double crosses, the triple crosses, the face swaps and the falling-outs—would be exhausting. Fortunately, the plot is just a rickety armature upon which the director has hung a one-damn-thing-after-another string of blazing action sequences. There's nothing to think about. You just set your mouth to AGAPE and lean back. The mission that Ethan Hunt chooses to accept this time out involves foiling a nuclear plot that's been cooked up by a mysterious villain called John Lark, leader of a group of international reprobates called the Apostles. Lark is about to score a suitcase full of plutonium from a flirty English arms trader called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, of The Crown), so Ethan and his usual team, Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), fly to Paris to disrupt the deal. Things are complicated, back in the States, by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), who dispatches her top assassin, August Walker (Hanry Cavill), to keep an eye on Ethan, who Sloan thinks has gotten soft in a job that requires maximum hard. Maybe she's right. When Ethan and Walker encounter a snarling Chinese killer (veteran stunt coordinator Liang Yang) in a dance-club men's room, the spectacular mayhem that results isn't going entirely our guy's way before shadowy MI-6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns from the last Mission movie to help out. Also on hand again from that film is homicidal anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who used to lead a terror org called the Syndicate, and I think still does; well maybe. (In tangentially related news, CNN news guy Wolf Blitzer is also in this movie—in a pretty clever fake-out scene involving a recalcitrant Norwegian rocket scientist.) Sorting out the various thugs scowling through this picture isn't easy—they all appear to buy their snug little suits from the same high-end tailor. But who has time to worry about that sort of thing when there's so much mad activity to contemplate—all the racing around from the Tate Modern in London to the Grand Palais in Paris, and then down to the bottom of the Seine for an ultra-queasy scene of subaquatic claustrophobia. There's the usual complement of squealing motorcycle action, of course—some of it going the wrong way against Parisian traffic—and there's a slam-bang elevator battle between Ethan and Walker that will give all future slam-bang elevator battles a new standard to shoot for. The movie ends in orgasmic spasms of action—a stunning helicopter chase high up in the clouds above Kashmir, a desperate struggle among Ilsa, Benji and Lane down below, and then a frantic two-man battle atop a towering stone mesa, with Ethan and Walker pounding away at each other while the traditional red digits of a bomb detonator click down relentlessly toward doomsday. A shameless cliché of course—this is not a movie of many surprises, genre-wise. But it's big expensive fun, and more power to it. Start your day with Reason.

"Jul 27, 2018"," Swallow this, old person. The time that has elapsed since the first Mission: Impossible film is – give or take a few months –the same as the gap between that project and the cancellation of the source television series. By this stage in the Bond franchise, Roger Moore was venerably pursuing Grace Jones up the Eiffel Tower. Those 22 years have passed without the series quite deciding what it's about. The original show was essentially a collection of sophisticated confidence tricks, but, since JJ Abrams took over in the 12th century, the flim-flam has become mere decoration. There's a bit of that in the opening section of this palatable sixth film. It is just there, however, to propel us towards a McGuffin of weighty proportions: a quantity of plutonium has been stolen and Ethan Hunt must track it down before nutters bring on the apocalypse. There's nothing much distinctive about Hunt to set the sequence apart from your Jack Ryan or your James Bond or your Jason Bourne. He has been a family man. He's not entirely ruthless. Yes, the not-quite-ageless Tom Cruise does play Hunt, but Tom Cruise played Jack Reacher and we've already forgotten that series ever existed. Maybe the moral quandary at the heart of Fallout – save the world or the person in front of you? – gives it an intellectual heft uncharacteristic of the modern action film. Maybe it really, really doesn’t. Okay, it's not quite a USP, but the standard and the nature of the action sequences do distinguish more recent Mission: Impossible episodes. Mission: Impossible – Fallout fairly froths with terrific, clattering violence that – staged with as little CGI as possible – makes competing summer flicks such as Skyscraper feel like clouds of generic software. The tile-crunching fight in a Parisian bathroom is better even than the loo bust-up in the opening section of Casino Royale. There's a bumpy, geographically sound car chase through the French capital that somehow maintains coherence despite the hysterical cutting. Best of all is a duel between helicopters that – requiring one to drop cargo on the other – comes across like an excellent smartphone game (I honestly mean that as a compliment). Oh, and Ethan gets to drive a lorry. Fallout also features smart casting in its wider margins. Henry Cavill, not the most flexible of actors, fits neatly as a CIA operative assigned as official minder to Hunt and his team from the Impossible Missions Force; nobody is better suited to the role of a mountainous agent who takes his styling tips from 1950s cigarette commercials. Rebecca Ferguson is still suave as the hilariously named Ilsa Faust. Angela Bassett coasts as Secretary of State at the Department for Narrative Exposition. The real stand out here is, however, the increasingly busy Vanessa Kirby. I'm sure Chris McQuarrie didn't actually ask her to play the cynical arms dealer as Princess Margaret – her role in The Crown – but the hint of regal disapproval adds enormous zest to the scowling White Widow. You can smell the gin from here. Cruise himself remains an odd, odd commodity. You sense the great man – born before the release of the Beatles first LP – straining to seem credible as an agent in the field. You sense him straining to seem credible as a human being. Shot in kindly light, he still looks remarkable, but every now and then folds of cheek suggest the middle-aged man bursting to break free from the well-tailored carapace. It may happen someday. What else does Mission: Impossible have to sell us? Well, it works hard to obey Alfred Hitchcock's rule about highlighting significant landmarks when visiting a glamorous locale. So, we get an excellent parachute descent on to the roof of Grand Palais in Paris (though I missed why they couldn't just take the Metro). There's a fine chase through Tate Modern in London. We must, however, lodge an objection against the decision to begin in Belfast without featuring an ascent of the Albert Clock or a pursuit along Goliath in Harland & Wolff.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 27, 2018"," Mission: Impossible — Fallout is, like every other entry in the M:I series, a well-paced action-thriller providing ample fodder for its ageless star, Tom Cruise, to wow us with virtuosic stunt work wrapped up in a modestly complicated plot. Unlike every other entry in the M:I series, Fallout is a direct sequel, taking place after the events of 2015's Rogue Nation and bringing back familiar villains. While the last few films in the series have featured callbacks to Ethan Hunt's (Cruise) ill-conceived marriage to Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan) in the third entry in the series, Fallout is a bit different in that its villain is more concerned with personal revenge than world-ending destruction, more interested in making Hunt pay than making the world a worse place. Maybe this shift in focus would feel less abrupt if the plot weren't entirely predictable from the get-go. Hunt is trying to track down a batch of plutonium that will be used as nuclear bombs by the remnants of the group of ticked-off undercover agents from Rogue Nation. When Hunt and his team are unable to obtain the nuclear material, they are forced to make a trade: the bomb cores for the release of spy-turned-terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the baddie from the previous film. Hunt is paired up with stone-fisted spook August Walker (Henry Cavill), who promptly suggests that Hunt is actually an undercover mastermind criminal siphoning secrets out of the American intelligence community in order to pursue his evil plans. The CIA, you see, has been aware of a mole for some time and Walker, the new guy on the scene, is dead set on pinning it all on Hunt and well if you can't see where all this is headed then bully for you but boy howdy is the resolution to all this kind of obvious. So obvious, in fact, that I almost wonder if the lack of a twist isn't a twist in and of itself. I don't generally have a ton of patience for the ""well this was so predictable"" critique—no one cares that you guessed what was coming, sparky—but in a spy thriller there should be some element of mystery, something that makes you go ""huh."" I mentioned this complaint to a critic friend, who replied that I was missing the point: The M:I movies don't really exist to make you go ""huh"" so much as ""whoa."" The plots, such as they are, exist solely in service of the stunts, the action, and the set pieces. Judged solely on that level, Fallout is a success, and a rousing one at that: Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie delivers a fantastic fistfight, a superb car chase, and a vertigo-inducing helicopter pursuit while intermingling scenes of cunning espionage work of the mask-pulling sort. McQuarrie's development into a sure-and-steady action filmmaker is one of the more pleasant surprises of the last six years: even when the pace is frenetic his camera is never unfocused and he rarely resorts to jittery motion as a stand-in for excitement. I was, frankly, nervous while watching Cruise wrestle on the edge of a mountain cliff: the danger felt immediate, the scale of the IMAX screen onto which it was projected crushing. And yet, despite the charm of the cast and skill of the stunts, I can't shake the feeling that dismissing the plot as beside the point—or suggesting it exists only to serve as an excuse for action, a reason to get Tom Cruise on top the Burj Khalifa or suspended from the floor of a touch-sensitive vault—renders the M:I flicks a more critically palatable version of the Transformers series, a stitched-together collection of set pieces that feel a bit hollow after the fact. Then again, there's nothing wrong with a more coherent, more competent, more charming iteration of the Transformers movies. You could ask for much worse from your end-of-summer entertainment.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," Ethan, Benji and Luther arrive at the meeting point - a dingy alleyway in the dead of night. This is how Mission: Impossible - Fallout begins. Benji can’t help but notice that there are no clean escape routes. He’s nervous. Beside him, Ethan is surveying the area, and their options. If they hit a roadblock, they’d be dead in minutes. If the enemy makes a move, they’d be dead in seconds. It’s a hairy situation, but they’ve been there before. They’ve survived worse before. Together - and Ethan knows this better than anyone - they can do the impossible. So he looks Benji right in his worried eyes, puts on a brave face and says, as earnestly as he can, “I won’t let anything happen to you, Benji.” And Benji believes him, because he has no reason not to - even though he’s trapped in an alley with no way out, and even though the future of the world is at stake. Over the years, Ethan has always been there for him, and for his team. He has never let them down. His enemies call it the ‘fundamental flaw’ in his character - he values life, he values people, and he will risk everything to protect them. It is this loyalty that plunges Ethan and the his crew into their next adventure in Mission: Impossible - Fallout, the sixth film in the increasingly exhilarating franchise. To me, the series has always been defined by individual moments rather than larger arcs. For example - and you can corroborate this - we all remember highlights from the previous films - the Burj Khalifa sequence, Owen Davian’s threats, the ingenious Scooby Doo-esque unmaskings - but very few of you would remember the finer details of the plots. They invariably involve international arms dealers and turncoat handlers, shady organisations and a complete and utter lack of faith in Ethan and his IMF crew. In that regard, Fallout is classic Mission Impossible. It is also perhaps the first film in the series that feels very much like a direct sequel to its immediate predecessor - 2015’s Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation. The most obvious connective tissue, besides director Christopher McQuarrie of course, is the villain, Solomon Lane.  I was somewhat underwhelmed by Lane in Rogue Nation, mostly because casting Sean Harris had initially seemed like such a brilliant idea, until his character turned out to be a cousin to Javier Bardem’s Silva from Skyfall, and ended up having way too little screen time to truly establish his presence. Fallout doesn’t quite solve the Solomon Lane problem, despite taking the Dark Knight approach to his character, but it does make better use of his anarchist ideologies, and retroactively reconciles some of Rogue Nation’s issues. The stakes, as always, are global. But since Ethan and Lane have a history together, there’s a personal element to their relationship, which the series has been sorely missing since Mission: Impossible III - my personal favourite. Mission: Impossible - Fallout hits many of the same beats as the previous films - there are double crosses and triple crosses and there is the obligatory scene in which Ethan’s disregard for the rules prompts the chiefs to put him on a leash. So they assign a chaperone for him, a disarmingly named beefcake called Walker, played by Henry Cavill - who receives second billing after Tom Cruise in the delightfully retro opening credits incidentally, and positively oozes machismo. Walker’s allegiances, of course, are spotty - and Cavill plays him less like a lunkhead than he could have, which is always a good thing. But he is vital to the proceedings, especially towards the third act. At the risk of cutting to the chase - and conveniently ignoring the espionage elements of the story - let’s just skip to the ending. You’ve seen bits of it in the trailers, and you’ve perhaps heard that it’s set in Kashmir - it’s true, although our esteemed censor board has ensured that the word ‘Kashmir’ is never spoken in the film - but you’re simply unprepared for the sheer intensity of the sequence. For his latest magic trick, Tom Cruise learned to not only fly a helicopter, but to also singlehandedly perform stunts in it. It’s a testament to his maniacal ambition that despite performing a pointless HALO jump in the film, by the time the incredible finale rolls around, the sight of Cruise jumping out of a plane is all but forgotten. There is a rhythmic ecstasy to Mission: Impossible - Fallout’s action scenes, a melodic glory that is not only rare, but almost unheard of on this scale. And it’s silent, all of it - which is unusual for McQuarrie, an Oscar winner known for his quick dialogue and strong grasp of genre tropes. So when the action happens - and a lot of this film’s plot is just an excuse to arrive at the next crazy stunt sequence - it’s breathtaking staged, with sound design that rattles the chairs on which you sit, and buttery editing that makes it all seem like a dance.  On two occasions, the screen explodes into the IMAX ratio, which fans of Christopher Nolan’s films would know is one of the purest, most joyous moments one can experience inside a movie theatre. And the IMAX wasn’t the only time I was reminded of Nolan during Mission: Impossible - Fallout . A Paris breakout sequence - by far my favourite chunk of the film - almost plays out like a remake of the Joker ambush scene from The Dark Knight, complete with a Hans Zimmer-inspired score (by one of his former Remote Control Productions minions, Lorne Balfe), practical effects and visual ingenuity. And in virtually every frame, grounding the often cartoonish narrative in realism and emotional heft, is Tom Cruise. I have nothing worthwhile to add to the conversation around him, other than to say that he will surprise you in this film - he will do his trademark karate chop run, because that’s what you want; he will risk his life leaping from buildings and out of planes, because he respects you too much to sell you a shoddy product. But he will surprise you. Because that’s what we want, don’t we, after six movies? We want to learn more about Ethan Hunt, about what motivates him - and Cruise - to risk his life everyday. With James Bond, it was Queen and country; with Jason Bourne it was a personal quest, but with Ethan Hunt it has always been about his friends, his team, and the relationships he has built over the years, despite knowing that being emotional can only get him into more trouble.  But he’s older now. He understands life and death better than anyone. It’s all worth it, these guys - Benji and Luther and Brandt and Ilsa and Julia. They’re all worth fighting for. The fuse has already been lit. He just has to make sure it doesn’t go out.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," There’s Harry Potter and, arguably, Fast and Furious. But you’d be hard-pushed to find one that ups its game and keeps offering as much bang for your buck as Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series. We’re back for the sixth episode of Ethan Hunt’s continued battle against the bad guys and, bloody hell, if it hasn’t just gone and delivered the best action film of the year so far . . . We begin in Belfast, where Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is having a nightmare about his wife and sworn enemy Solomon Lane, the ­brilliantly evil Sean Harris who, if you remember, is the anarchist now in custody after the previous escapade in Rogue Nation. Solomon’s Syndicate is now using some stolen ­plutonium for nefarious purposes and the Impossible ­Missions Force are in charge of thwarting an exchange, which doesn’t go particularly well. The chase is then on, taking them around the world where they bump into some friendly — and many not-so-friendly — faces. Among them is August Walker (Henry Cavill), the CIA operative in charge of keeping his eye on Hunt. We meet a group called The Apostles, the White Witch broker who, truth told, don’t add much except as bullet fodder and glamour. But it’s all about the moral dilemma and race against time here, folks. We even get the phrase, “I murder women and children with smallpox . . . I have no line,” uttered with such a straight face, you gasp and clutch your pearls rather than chuckle at the absurdity. Its honesty, and the complete investment from the actors, are what makes this such a good film — it completely believes in itself. It’s also confident enough not to rely so much on Cruise’s big setpieces, although they are still the highlights. Instead, it offers a pretty expansive gang movie where characters such as Benji (Simon Pegg) and Lisa (Rebecca Ferguson) add more to the plot than your usual romance and comedy sidekicks. There’s freefalling from planes, motorbikes going like the clappers through Paris, helicopters defying physics and the piece de resistance — Cruise bombing across the ­Millennium Bridge.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Nobody runs like Tom Cruise in a Mission: Impossible movie. The man is like a steam train at full speed, his rigid arms and legs pumping like pistons as he tears down back alleys, tears after moving vehicles or tears across rooftops, seldom pausing before leaping between hideously high buildings. Along with self-destructing analogue messages, goofy rubber masks and real-world stunts performed by the Cruiser himself, his running style has become emblematic of this now 22-year-old franchise, oddly symbolic of its durability as an ongoing blockbuster concern in an age of superhero movies. Judging from Misson: Impossible - Fallout, there’s certainly no danger of the films or Cruise running out of puff anytime soon. Indeed, this sixth outing for Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his disaster averting/disaster causing Impossible Missions Force is up there with JJ Abrams’s Mission: Impossible III as a contender for the best of the bunch. Once again written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, the new film loops back to that third outing to tie off a storyline that began with Hunt’s marriage to Michelle Monaghan’s Julia while also simultaneously picking up where the previous film, Rogue Nation left off. That does mean that the first half hour forces you to play catch-up with an overarching mythology that’s never been all that memorable. But if it’s become one of the unintentional jokes of the series that following the plots of these films can be an impossible mission in its own right, McQuarrie steps things up by transforming Fallout into an exercise in pure blockbuster cinema.  As Hunt finds himself traversing the globe on a mission to retrieve some stolen plutonium – plutonium that is now in the hands of an arms dealer because Hunt refused to sacrifice his team on an earlier mission to get it out of circulation – McQuarrie uses the expansive (and expensive) set-pieces not to distract us from the absence of great dialogue or a more nuanced narrative, but to engage us with the characters and their dilemmas. Letting the beautifully executed action dictate the story, he delights in the rug-pulling reveals the series affords him and offsets any trickery with action choreography that respects both the spatial geography of the scenes and the actual geography of the cities in which those scenes are set. That negates the need to cut the action to ribbons in the editing room or blow things up for the sake of it. There’s a purpose to every foot or car or motorbike chase and it’s a joy to see scenes set across busy parts of London or Paris unfurl in ways that seem plausible. The action is pretty meaty too. A dust-up in a pristine Parisian nightclub toilet involving Cruise, the Chinese actor Liang Yang and Henry Cavill – cast here as a CIA assassin assigned to keep tabs on Hunt – is brutal in its proficiency and it’s a smart move to bring back Rebecca Ferguson as the British version of Hunt: she saves his bacon on more than one occasion and has an agenda of her own that adds additional intrigue to a story that flirts with the notion that all this secret undercover world-saving work might have taken its psychological toll on Hunt.  On the downside, it’s still mission impossible to watch Simon Pegg’s schtick and not groan a little, but even he’s not as annoying as he used to be (he’s effectively become the C-3PO of the series, which is a step up from being its Jar Jar Binks). What’s really surprising, though, is that the relentless spectacle never gets tiring. McQuarrie and Cruise save the best for last with a visually jaw-dropping finale set in Kashmir. Replete with nuclear bombs, a literal ticking clock and Cruise hanging off the side of a rock face, it brings the whole ludicrous race-against-time plot to a head in suitably breathless fashion. It’s the blockbuster of the summer.  The debut feature from British director Daniel Kokotajlo, Apostasy draws on Kokotajlo’s own experiences as a former Jehovah’s Witness to lend a harrowing sense of authenticity to this story about a devout mother and her teenage daughters’ conflicted relationship with their faith. Set in Oldham, the film is initially told from the perspective of youngest daughter Alex (Molly Wright), whose guilt over receiving a life-saving blood transfusion as a child has made her more committed to Jehovah than her more headstrong sister Louisa, who is at college and has already started seriously questioning their upbringing when she falls pregnant to a non-believer, a situation that results in her being “disfellowshipped”.  Little by little the film, which Kokotajlo strips free of melodrama, zeroes in on their mother, Ivanna (Siobhan Finneran), whose unwavering commitment to her own beliefs are severely tested when further tragedy strikes and she finds herself increasingly isolated within the order’s patriarchal structure. Respectful yet sharply critical, the film’s specificity about a world rarely seen on screen is gripping, but it’s the silent pain of Finneran’s performance as the fissures start to appear in Ivanna’s life that linger longest.  Nothing lingers after watching Hotel Transylvania 3: Monster Vacation. Once again featuring the vocal stylings of Adam Sandler as Dracula, this one sees him going on a summer cruise with his family and falling for the great-granddaughter of age-old vampire hunter Van Helsing. There are better ways for your kids to pass the time over the school holidays.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2018"," Trying to stop genocidal baddies getting their evil hands on globes of plutonium so they can wreak nuclear havoc on humanity might not be the most original plot of a blockbuster action movie.  But who cares when such a plot is packaged as slickly as this, with some of the most exhilarating fight and chase scenes ever choreographed for the silver screen?  Danny Boyle, the director of the next Bond film, might have to raise his and 007’s game. Even the bladder-bursting 147-minute running time of Mission: Impossible – Fallout can be forgiven, given the number of thrilling action sequences it facilitates. Their last Mission: Impossible collaboration brought us 2015’s highly enjoyable Rogue Nation, but this is a notch or two better, with Cruise, now 56, still maddeningly plausible running, jumping, punching and hanging onto helicopters while dodging bullets.  Cruise is, of course, Impossible Missions Force agent Ethan Hunt, whose challenge this time — much like every other time — is to thwart ‘a syndicate of rogue covert operatives’ bent on all sorts of murder and mayhem. Setting aside the distraction of John Lark And The Apostles sounding like the support act for Echo And The Bunnymen, Hunt makes his singular way to Paris by sky-diving from 25,000 ft on to the glass roof of the Grand Palais during an electrical storm. The Eurostar and a taxi from the Gare du Nord would have done the same job, but presumably, Impossible Missions operatives aren’t allowed to take the easy option. The Channel Tunnel must be for their weedy counterparts over at Feasible Missions. By now, Hunt not only has his usual accomplices in tow, in the form of wise-cracking Benji (Simon Pegg) and stolidly loyal Luther (Ving Rhames), but also a shady CIA man called Walker (played by Henry ‘Superman’ Cavill). Walker has been assigned by his own boss (Angela Bassett) to follow Hunt’s every move, which doesn’t go down too well with Hunt’s boss (Alec Baldwin). In any case, it’s easier said than done once our hero is whizzing through the streets of Paris in pursuit of rogue British agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who emerged in Rogue Nation as an anarchist determined to destroy the old world order.  However, the White Widow needs him as collateral in a deal for the plutonium, so Hunt, the man who caught him, now has to spring him. It is further complicated by the presence of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), introduced in the last film as an agent whose motivation, good or bad, seemed to have even the screenwriters stumped. It’s still not entirely clear which side she’s on, but she and Hunt don’t half fancy each other, which can only be good news for humankind. Eventually, by way of some more thrilling chase scenes in London, taking in St Paul’s Cathedral and the Tate Modern just as the excitement in Paris incorporated the Grand Palais, the Eiffel Tower, the Opera and the Arc de Triomphe (I sometimes think film-makers must get their location ideas from tea towels), the action moves to Kashmir on the border of China, India and Pakistan. You really don’t need to know why, but suffice to say that the climactic chase scene there, initially in a pair of helicopters, is one of the most spectacular I have ever seen. Cruise is reputed to do most of his own stunts. Indeed, this was the film on which he smashed his ankle while leaping between London rooftops.  Actually, I won’t mind, either. On behalf of all men in their mid-50s, let me say that it’s about time he started acting his age. At any rate, a third one in the Hotel Transylvania series seems excessive and even the under-tens might recognise its comic premise as a little strained. As before, Adam Sandler provides the voice of Dracula, or Drac, who, at the start of the film, in a flashback to 1897, is busy outsmarting his nemesis, the committed vampire-hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan). Drac and his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez), along with pals including Frankenstein (Kevin James) and a werewolf called Wayne (Steve Buscemi), then wind up on a modern-day cruise ship, captained by the comely Ericka (Kathryn Hahn). Drac and the gang are unaware that her great-grandfather — still knocking about even though most parts of his body have fallen off in the intervening century — is none other than Van Helsing. He needs Ericka’s help to destroy Drac and the other monsters once and for all, with a key hidden deep in the Lost City of Atlantis.  Meanwhile, Drac is miserable because he hasn’t had a date for 100 years and is resigned to never again experiencing the ‘zing’ — the monster word for love at first sight. That’s the basic plot, but director Genndy Tartakovsky — who also brought us the two previous Hotel Transylvania films — conspicuously fails to give it much substance. By the time Atlantis hoves into view — as a sub-oceanic Las Vegas — Drac and his pals are little more than a pain in the neck.  Siobhan Finneran is not a household name, but she might be familiar to you from some very good TV dramas in which she usually plays second fiddle — to Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley and to Sheridan Smith in The Moorside. Well, here, she is very much first violin and quite brilliant as Ivanna, a single mother who has brought up her two daughters, Luisa and Alex, as devout Jehovah’s Witnesses.  This is a superbly acted film, which chronicles the contrasting paths of the two girls. Luisa (Parkinson) gets pregnant by a non-believer and is ‘disfellowshipped’ by the elders, who decree that her mother and sister must have no contact with her.  Alex (Wright), who is being courted by a newly-arrived elder (Robert Emms), is unwavering in her adherence to the faith, despite an illness that requires medical attention the Witnesses will not sanction. It is a piercingly well-observed and heartbreakingly sad drama, but above all, impressively restrained, even when the small, stressed family unit is struck by tragedy. ‘Imagine when Jesus comes back at Armageddon to destroy this world . . . how’s he going to feel when you’re at college?’ says Ivanna, who is worried — rightly, as it turns out — by the worldly influences to which Luisa is being exposed. It is a line that looks ridiculous written down, but Kokotajlo’s skill, and Finneran’s, is to make us understand how she must feel and the pain she suffers as she strives to fit her responsibilities and emotions as a mother within the noose-like constraints of religious dogma.  This stodgy, but enlightening, documentary (directed by Peter Stephan Jungk, her great-nephew) explains that she was born Edith Suschitzky in 1908 and later married an English doctor, Alexander Tudor-Hart. By the early Thirties, Edith was living in Britain, working for Soviet Intelligence, and helped to recruit the so-called Cambridge Five, who each did untold damage to Britain over many years.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2018"," There will always be new leading men in Hollywood. But Cruise seems determined to prove that none of them will ever work as hard as he does. Tom Cruise is a runner. Other movie stars have honed a look, a lean, a strut, but Cruise runs. If you have 18 minutes to spare, you can watch a supercut someone made of all the times Cruise has picked up the pace onscreen over the years — hauling ass through downtown Memphis with his briefcase bouncing at his side in 1993's The Firm, sprinting panicked through a deserted Times Square in 2001's Vanilla Sky, and galloping across a battlefield in an exosuit in 2014's Edge of Tomorrow. When Cruise runs, he pushes his chest out, pumps his arms wildly, grimaces with exertion. The uncoolness of it all is key to the appeal. Other actors can serve up a performance of running, but Cruise, never one to give less than his all, wants to make it clear that he is genuinely going as fast as he can. The best and the most running Cruise has done has been in service of the Mission: Impossible movie franchise, now 22 years strong and counting: He's raced through tunnels and hails of bullets, up buildings and down them, and along a crowded Shanghai waterfront, yelling at people to make way in broken Mandarin. In the new Mission: Impossible — Fallout, he runs so far and so hard that you have to laugh. Simon Pegg's character, Benji, yells into his earpiece for him to go faster as he bounds across rooftops, through a busy office, and out a window. He's more wind-up toy than man in the movie's final act, going and going and going through a combination chase and fight that's teased out to such exhilaratingly absurd ends that it's more like extreme slapstick on which the fate of millions depends. There may be leading men with fresher faces out there in Hollywood, but Cruise seems determined to prove with every second of screentime that none of them will ever work as hard as he does. Trying has become Cruise's reason for being, or at least his reason for remaining famous. Movie stardom is not what it was when Cruise starred in the first Mission: Impossible back in 1996. Back then, when Brian De Palma adapted an old TV show into a movie that twined a barely comprehensible plot around astonishing sequences of Cruise dangling from cables and clinging to a high-speed train, action was just one of the things Cruise got to play at, just one of the things that made him one of the biggest stars in the world. He was a multipurpose A-lister who hopped easily onward to a romance that same year (Jerry Maguire) and then to working with Stanley Kubrick (in 1999's Eyes Wide Shut). Now that it's franchises more than famous names that bring people to theaters, so many of those in-between movies — ones that could be big deals without being blockbusters, ones that might nab you an occasional Oscar nomination — have gone away. But Cruise has not. Cruise has held fast, devoting himself to action (like Jack Reacher and the maybe-kaput Dark Universe cinematic, er, universe) when that seemed to be what the studios wanted to make. When it comes to recent cultural shifts that ask for ever more authenticity (real or simulated) from celebrities, on the other hand, he's steered clear. Nothing about Cruise is authentic. He is always tirelessly on, always happy to glad-hand with fans, always a pro, his social media accounts painstakingly promotional and impersonal. Whatever political feelings he might have, he keeps to himself. The unfathomable alienness of Cruise's life as someone who's been extremely famous for decades and swaddled in Scientology like a precious ornament for almost as long has been hinted at only in miscalculations (like Oprah's couch) and accidents (like that leaked Scientology video). At this point in his career, it is entirely possible that no one actually wants to know about the real Tom Cruise, and he doesn't seem like he's about to finally start offering up details. What he is willing to offer up is pure effort, in defiance of current trends and the terrible march of time. Cruise leaves everything on the field in his movies, especially the Mission: Impossible ones, and because of that, they're immensely fun to watch — even as you think, Wow, he might die from this someday. Cruise is 56, though he doesn't look it. He doesn't look 53 either, the age we know his Mission: Impossible character Ethan Hunt is (this is thanks to someone in the first film, never imagining how long this series would stretch, tethering the secret agent to an actual date of birth: 08/18/64). Cruise doesn't come across as looking younger than he is so much as he comes across as someone who has managed to remove himself from the standard human timeline. In Fallout, his too-busy-saving-the-day stubble is gray, while his hair is lustrously brown. When he is placed in deliberate contrast, at different points, with 35-year-old Henry Cavill as a brawny, destructive colleague from the CIA and with 39-year-old Wes Bentley as a rival on a more personal level, the movie displays not the tiniest flicker of awareness of either as a younger man. The Mission: Impossible universe does not acknowledge the possibility that Ethan might someday need to slow down or not be around, or that such a thought has ever occurred to him. And at the same time, Cruise's mortality underlies so much of the marketing around how the movies are made, how he continues to do most of the increasingly outrageous stunts himself, and how the results are so much better — and they really are so much better — for it. Cruise has hung off airplanes, cliffs, and the tallest skyscraper in the world. He has, the promotional material assures us, learned to hold his breath underwater for six minutes and to fly a helicopter. In Fallout, he does a military-style parachute jump, the camera preceding him out of the plane and holding on his apprehensive face as he plummets through the air, and part of what makes the set piece so spectacular is that there's no need to cheat the shot or cut around a double. He also broke his ankle leaping off a building, footage of which was then played in multiple angles when the cast appeared on The Graham Norton Show, including a slow-motion variation in which you can see his foot bend at an agonizingly unnatural angle. He nevertheless clambered up the building and past the cameras to complete the shot. It's in the finished movie. Fallout is thrilling in a way that is out of sync with blockbuster fashions. It doesn't try for any sort of present-day political resonance, and while it's a more direct sequel than any of the past installments, there's still nothing you really need to know in advance if you go in without having seen any of them, no larger arc being worked toward. Instead of making use of computer-generated effects, the film relies on those Cruise-enabled practical action sequences that are impeccably envisioned by Christopher McQuarrie, who also directed the previous installment, Rogue Nation. This movie offers a straightforward sort of joy, and any streak of perverseness that might also be part of the spectacle really only comes to mind later. As Pegg quips, when he closes out a Fallout promo video that documents the five big stunts Cruise did for the film, ""They're genuinely risking their lives to entertain people, which is incredibly valiant and... daft."" His tone is admiring, but he's capturing a particular truth: Cruise's seeming deep need to give this much, to constantly up the stakes and try harder, is what mediates the suspicion that these movies will one day reduce him to a smear on the tarmac.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," Helicopter battles. Skydiving hijinks. Hair-raising parkour. These are just some of the daredevil stunts Tom Cruise pulls off as he returns as IMF super operative Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible — Fallout, the sixth instalment in the franchise. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie (he also helmed Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation and is the only director to return to the franchise for a second go), Fallout takes Cruise’s affinity for putting his life in danger over and over again and marries it to some engaging character development. The result is a memorable action movie the likes of which you probably haven’t seen in the recent past. The story, for a change, seems to pick up very soon after the events of Rogue Nation. Hunt, along with his IMF teammates Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), are on the search for a terrorist named John Lark, and his 12 minions ominously called the Apostles, who are supposedly on a mission to blow up big cities across the world with nuclear bombs. Hunt’s mission (“should he choose to accept”) is to intercept the mysterious Lark before he can buy the nuclear material. Some new faces have joined the crew. Alec Baldwin is Alan Hunley, who is overseeing Hunt’s mission. Kryptonian Henry Cavill sheds the cape and picks up a gun to play CIA assassin August Walker, who is shadowing Hunt to make sure no mistakes are made on the orders of Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), whom we’ve met in previous instalments, is back and is up to no good. Terrorist/former IMF agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) makes a comeback also after Hunt locked him up in Rogue Nation. But great casting aside, the true strength of Fallout is its ability to make full use of the franchise’s backstory to raise the stakes, both personal and in terms of the action. The movie is full of heart (maybe too much heart because the line between the ambitious and the asinine can be very, very thin) and once again pokes at the moral conundrum: is it okay to sacrifice the life of one to save many? Cavill’s cavalier Walker will say yes. Hunt is at a firm no. And this is where Fallout gets most exciting. It’s a joy to watch the two get used to being around each other and some of the best scenes in the movie are built around the chemistry between them. And while we may never understand all the hype behind Cavill’s moustache, or how it could have in any way contributed to Fallout’s larger storyline, it needs to be said that Cavill makes bad boys look oh-so-good. Where the film starts to lose its vice-like grip on the audiences’ attention span is when it ditches the action to add more twists and turns in the already loopy and exposition-filled plot, so much so that at one point I honestly had no idea what was happening in the movie. A plot line involving The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby, although entertaining for a while, stretches far beyond anyone’s comfort level. Tight editing and an even tighter script would have greatly benefitted this movie that currently has a run time of a whopping 150 minutes. Watch Mission: Impossible — Fallout to experience old-fashioned action cinema at its best. Just be prepared to be strapped in for longer than you’re used to. But when thrilling set pieces, heart-poundingly glorious fight sequences, campy dialogues from Cruise and Cavill’s big guns are involved, it might just be worth it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2018","Astounding, gripping, heart-pounding set pieces.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," What is there to say about Mission: Impossible—Fallout? It stars Tom Cruise, who is about 93 but runs like he’s 16. It is maybe the sixth film in the franchise? I have no idea what “Fallout” refers to. Yes, there are plutonium orbs, a shadowy cabal of anarchists threatening nuclear Armageddon, but—spoiler—Cruise stops them! This takes something just south of two and a half hours. There are car chases, sky dives, underwater rescues, helicopter duels, London, Paris, Kashmir. Alec Baldwin is a thoroughly implausible CIA director. This is a deeply, spiritually, existentially silly movie. It is also essential. I’m not kidding! Look around. So much is terrible: Trump, deadly wildfires, tick-borne diseases. Kanye got canceled. Scorpion is too long. Pete Davidson is right: Social media is awful. There are how many days left in the summer? Don’t even tell me. This movie vanquishes all that. It is probably a bad film, but I can’t think of anything bad to say about it. Okay, the title sequence is the cheesiest thing I’ve seen since . . . since the last Mission: Impossible movie’s title sequence. The dialogue seems like it was written by a team of fifth graders. But the movie delivers, the way Hollywood summer movies used to, an entirely physical sensation of delight. Your brain plays no role; your brain sort of disappears from your head. Cruise did them all himself and broke his ankle, blah blah blah. You don’t care. You don’t care that he taught himself to fly a helicopter and jumped out of a plane 106 times at 25,000 feet to get this one single sequence right. If you have to hear one more heroic anecdote about Cruise’s commitment to his art you will puke. But here’s the thing: The relative lack of CGI, the way bodies run and leap and climb and slam into things in this movie makes you catch your breath. That sequence where Cruise does jump out of a high-altitude plane is impeccably shot and excruciatingly exciting—and a slap in the face to Marvel movies past, present, and future (you know what’s more exciting than superpowers? Gravity). Another sequence where he races a motorcycle through Paris, against heavy traffic, around the Arc de Triomphe, with gendarmes in hot pursuit, is only slightly more thrilling than one in which he does the same thing in a charmingly compact BMW. And I won’t even tell you about the cliffside duel in Kashmir. There are two actresses who elevate Fallout from the silly to the sublime. Kirby is the first. You know her from The Crown, and it’s not much of a leap from Princess Margaret to a London crime boss named the White Widow. Obviously, Kirby is gorgeous when she appears in an ivory sheath dress at a preposterous rave in Paris, but she’s also an entirely natural action heroine, matching that mischievous twinkle in Cruise’s eye with one flirtatious glance after another. And when she flips a butterfly knife out of her garter belt and starts swinging at the bad guys, you think: spin-off. There are plenty of movie stars in Fallout—Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg; Henry Cavill and Angela Bassett—but I’m not sure there’s another actor on the screen like Ferguson. The Swedish-British stunner plays MI6 assassin Ilsa Faust, just like she did in the last movie, which I cannot remember anything about, except Ferguson in a bikini by a pool in, I think, Morocco? She and Cruise’s character, Ethan Hunt, have a thing. They almost ran away together, and now they’re both trying to stop the anarchists—but by different methods. Ferguson actually looks mournful, soulful, and genuinely serious as she tells Cruise, lovingly, “Please, don’t make me go through you.” Give her an Oscar. And more roles, please. I will watch her in anything. This takes place at the Grand Palais in Paris and involves Cruise, Cavill (a CIA-affiliated killer), and a Chinese stunt actor named Liang Yang. It’s a punch-fest with bodies smashing walls and splashing through mirrors, and you’ve seen it all before, but this one is so well-choreographed and visceral and the actors grunt and shout and the bathroom is so impeccably white and weirdly spacious. The sequence is a kind of kinetic poetry. (Avoid the trailer; most of it’s there, alas.) By my count, this is two good Cruise movies in a row, after a string of big-budget disasters. Is the Cruise-aissance upon us? Three would make it so, and Cruise’s next movie is the Top Gun reboot, which cannot be good. But what if it is? Fallout gives me hope.

"Jul 26, 2018",Fallout may be the most viscerally satisfying blockbuster sequel since James Cameron changed the whole game with Terminator 2.,POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," Outside of gifting the world one iconic heist scene of Tom Cruise, spread-eagle, zipping down from the ceiling, Brian De Palma’s 1996 summer hit Mission: Impossible left two lasting impressions: that the plot was infernally circuitous and that Cruise had found his franchise. Five sequels and four presidents later, Cruise shows in Mission: Impossible – Fallout (★★★½) that he still cuts it as Ethan Hunt, lead spy of the super-secret, spectacularly well-equipped Impossible Mission Force. Hunt’s method of intense planning, running, and gritting it out to solve the world’s certain-doom problems suits Cruise’s nimble but no-nonsense approach to the character, to moviemaking, and to everything his audience sees him do in public. He’s obviously done a heroic job maintaining a stake in assuring that these pictures are as fast-paced and exciting as their top-dollar budgets will allow. Part of the strategy has been to not try to fix what isn’t broken, like the famous Lalo Schifrin theme music. The flip side of that strategy has been the producers’ decision to hand the keys of each new M:I vehicle to a different director. But Cruise and company throw in a curveball for this summer’s outing, bringing back the series’ first repeat filmmaker, Christopher McQuarrie, who directed predecessor Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Accordingly, McQuarrie, an Oscar-winner for writing The Usual Suspects, picks up several threads left dangling in Rogue Nation. Providing the most direct story continuation of any of the sequels, Fallout resumes Hunt’s dalliance with British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). Dalliance, which isn’t that strong a word, might still be too strong a word to describe the romance between Hunt and Ilsa. That they “care” for each other is explicitly stated, but only vaguely rendered. We’ll take their words for it, as they rescue each other one minute, and attempt to run Bimmers and motorbikes over each other a few scenes later. The two square-shooting spies can’t define their relationship any more than we can. And they don’t know — or aren’t revealing to one another all they know — about a plot to kill another Rogue Nation returnee, the nefarious ex-agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). In the earlier film and in this one, Harris adds potent menace. The sheer creepiness of this unrepentant anarchist, fueled by random movie-villain rage against the system, helps balance cartoonish conceits like the IMF’s signature life-like rubber masks. The high-tech, deadly world Ethan Hunt inhabits wouldn’t be very scary or a lick as credible without a villain who seems like they’d actually wipe out a metropolis, and not just monologue about it. But the movie has another evil mastermind up its sleeve, known only by the secret identity John Lark, who’s in the hunt for a cache of plutonium. Remaining offscreen, Lark might be any of the film’s cast of heavy hitters, including Simon Pegg’s returning sidekick, Benji Dunn, or spy chiefs played by Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin. Hunt’s friendly foil most of the running time is surly agent August Walker, portrayed by DC’s current Superman, Henry Cavill. The style and size difference between Hunt and Walker is shot for maximum contrast by cinematographer Rob Hardy. There’s also lens flare for days, and a percussive precision to the stunts and action, whether Hunt’s brawling in a nightclub men’s room, hanging off the side of a building, or dangling from a speeding helicopter. Cruise’s inexhaustible appetite for creating wow-worthy stunts and action-packed set-pieces doesn’t disappoint. Running with Ethan Hunt straight out of the cargo bay of a soaring C-17 into the night sky delivers breathtaking visual impact. McQuarrie has prospered in the Tom Cruise business of late, directing and writing for the actor’s Jack Reacher films, among other projects. The filmmaking duo concocts an intriguing direction for Ethan Hunt here, by having the licensed killer attempt to hold himself to a higher standard when weighing the cost of any life he might take or sacrifice. That doesn’t stop the bullets from flying willy-nilly, but it adds a pound of meaning. Supplying gravitas is in the job description for Ving Rhames, returning for his sixth appearance as IMF agent Luther Stickell. It’s warm comfort to see Rhames back, but unfortunate that Luther spends so much screen time just talking about how capable Ethan is, or telling people how Ethan’s doing. Half a dozen movies in, Luther should have more of his own thing going. Alas, Fallout and its characters, even the resolutely independent Ilsa, revolve around Ethan Hunt. Cruise, no surprise, pulls off Hunt’s derring-do with aplomb, but, for some viewers, the screen Maverick might be upstaged by Cavill’s epic pornstache. The whiskers contribute to the characterization, as pummel-first, ask-questions-later Agent Walker looks and carries himself exactly as he’s described, like the hammer to Hunt’s scalpel. Written and played as being not terribly swift, Walker’s blunt, bruising physicality might be his most memorable trait, if it weren’t for the Magnum ‘stache.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Mission: Impossible—Fallout, the sixth installment of the action-movie series that started 22 years ago, offers a definitive verdict on the franchise’s place as vital Hollywood entertainment. It does so, in part, by once more tapping tried-and-true hero, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the agent who represents the best America has to offer. Hunt refuses to accept any premise that sometimes he must sacrifice one team member in order to save the lives of many. Hunt always, no matter what odds, attempts to save everyone. Hunt exemplifies never-say-die courage. Hunt achieves the seemingly impossible. Along with Hunt, this film returns writer-director Christopher McQuarrie—the first repeat director in the series’ history. Just as McQuarrie did in 2015 with his superb M:I—Rogue Nation, here, he spins a knotty tale of intrigue, innuendo, and infinite double-crosses. And this story props up some of the most exciting large-scale action scenes ever filmed. I could nitpick the plot to death. I also could quibble that an equally compelling character—MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson)—isn’t as crucial to this story as she was in the last film, and that M:I–Fallout’s conclusion features possibly the longest 15-minute timer in cinema history. But it’s easy to let all of that slide, partially because the movie has a sense of humor about itself, and also because the cause-and-effect of each action sequence is laid out so plainly and urgently. Much of this comes from what I’m calling “The John Wick Effect” making a noticeable difference here. The action film John Wick was directed by two former stuntmen, and their commitment to performing live, on-camera stunts rather than relying on CGI to piece together action scenes, makes the film feel real and visceral, rather than like a videogame. Using that aesthetic, and bolstered by a $178 million budget for exotic on-location shooting, as well as by a fluid editing style that allows the viewer to understand everything that is happening (rather than a Bourne-style shaky-cam that imitates urgency), McQuarrie brings Cruise (who just turned 56) into gritty, tense encounters where he is bested in certain fights and grows visibly tired, just like Keanu Reeves in John Wick. There is always a danger that the audience, too, will tire from this franchise. It’s a difficult task to keep viewers connected to a sprawling series and to put together two and a half hours of solid thrills and surprises with a good level of emotional investment in the main character.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," At some point midway through Mission: Impossible – Fallout—the sixth entry in the franchise and director Christopher McQuarrie’s unprecedented second go at helming one of these beasts—CIA brute Austin Walker (Henry Cavill) asks his superior, CIA Director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett), how many times she thinks Übermensch Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) will put up with his country screwing him over before he snaps. Walker’s question is rhetorical, intended to convince Sloane that Hunt is actually John Lark, the alias of a shadowy conspirator planning to buy stolen plutonium whom he and Hunt also happen to be chasing, but the question is better put before Cruise, the film’s bright, shining star. It’s a question that hangs over this dependably mind-blowing action flick more obviously than any installment to come before: How long can 56-year-old Cruise keep doing this before he, truly and irrevocably, snaps? Fallout never offers an answer, most likely because Cruise won’t have one until his body just completely gives out, answering for him by default. Fallout shows no real signs of that happening any time soon. What it does show is a kind of blockbuster intuition for what makes our enormous action brands—from Fast and the Furious to the MCU—thrive, behind only Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol as the best of the now 22-year endeavor. Where Bird leaned into the franchise as a literalization of its title, redefining the series by balancing the absurdity of what Cruise was impossibly doing (the Burj Khalifa scene is one of the greatest action sequences ever) with the awe of bearing witness to what a human person could accomplish if devoid of all Thetans, McQuarrie considers the two pretty much the same thing. The only reaction worthy of such absurdity is awe—and the only American tentpole films worth our awe anymore are those deemed Mission: Impossible. Due of course to Tom Cruise, probably a terrible man but definitely a cinematic treasure, giving his all, flesh and bones and functional social relationships and reasonable belief systems, to whatever movie he’s making. His goal is nothing less than transcendence, and isn’t that what going to see a movie like this is all about? Throughout Fallout, McQuarrie’s script characterizes the often chameleonic Ethan Hunt as an idealist, a person who considers one life as important as 1,000, a pure protector of all that is good and right in the world. “I won’t let anything happen to you,” he tells both Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), his closest allies/best friends, seemingly every day. Ethan Hunt is himself an ideal, declaring more than twice that he’ll “figure it out” as he confronts one belligerently hairy situation after another. McQuarrie may be the first M: I director to get Tom Cruise because he bends his M: I films to cater completely to Tom Cruise’s quest for perfection. There is no flawless plan to follow, there is only the corpus of one man keenly aligned with the hidden machinations of this complex universe. He’s like Domino (Zazie Beetz) from Deadpool 2, were luck to deign it necessary for her to be able to hold her breath for six minutes under water.  As has been the case in the previous five films, Fallout’s plot—while unsurprisingly coherent if you pay the least amount of attention (seriously, it’s not that bad; god forbid a script not feed the audience endless exposition)—has little bearing on pushing us from one spectacle to the next. Still, McQuarrie has alloyed J.J. Abrams’ need to too-thoroughly explore Ethan Hunt’s backstory with Bird’s reliance on Hunt as a vessel for action as opposed to a real human being. He’s done this in Fallout (as he did to a lesser degree in Rogue Nation, which in retrospect feels like a stage-setting) by aiming the film’s climactic action sequence solely at Ethan Hunt. Our hero is not just saving millions of lives, he’s (perhaps more importantly) saving the lives of the only people he loves. It’s such a pure distillation of blockbuster moviemaking that one might miss it: The action is both in service of itself, for its own sake, and in service to the development of this character, Ethan Hunt, who is really just Tom Cruise’s idealized version of himself, which means that all we need to know to care about him is that all he cares about is protecting the people he loves. For Ethan Hunt, that’s Benji, Luther, his ex-love Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and his maybe-new love, MI6 agent Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson). For Tom Cruise, the only people he loves are his audience. He protects us by giving himself whole cloth to his art, which at this point in his career is full physical sacrifice. He faces death so that we may glimpse what comes after. So that we may behold a small man soar through lightning-streaked clouds. The plot of Fallout involves three very movie-friendly spheres of plutonium, traded amongst terrorists to the eventual service of building two nuclear bombs under the world-shaking purview of previous villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), all while the CIA still warily oversees Ethan Hunt’s exploits. Though Jeremy Renner’s out of the picture, the ever-invasive governmental watchdogging provides the opportunity to introduce Agent Walker and his prodigious biceps, the perfect foil(s) to Ethan Hunt’s good guy persona. An early fight scene in a men’s bathroom in a Parisian club, bereft of music and scored only by the thuds and cracks of fists and plaster, contrasts the two characters with balletic precision: Walker punches his way out of any situation, while Hunt prefers to be less blunt with his spycraft and/or government-sanctioned murder. Double-teaming a man they believe to be the aforementioned John Lark, the two navigate a geography McQuarrie lays out almost effortlessly. Our initial impressions of Walker—that he solves everything through force and carries no sense of loyalty with him on his missions—resolve predictably, but satisfactorily, because everything we need to know we can gather from the way he “thanks” Hunt for saving his life, or the way he “reloads” his arms before socking ersatz John Lark in the ribs. To his credit, Cavill relishes the violent, moral ambiguity of Walker, his mustache and the menacing face shadowed by it worth every ludicrous dollar Paramount made Warner Bros pay to have it digitally removed. So it goes with every action scene in the film, from the immediately proceeding motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris to the final helicopter battle (which is exactly as that sounds). McQuarrie’s sense of building a scene on the barest of elements, communicating the most empirical of information, is so breathlessly impeccable, the plot barely seems to matter aside from creating easily understood stakes and giving Ethan Hunt a reason to keep, in the parlance of the film, figuring it out.  But how long can this last? The most protracted of the Mission: Impossible movies by something like 20 minutes, Fallout does bear the weight of time, and the audience can begin to feel it. “The end you always feared is coming. And the blood will be on your hands. The fallout of all your good intentions,” Lane creepily warns Hunt. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt as Tom Cruise has no words to suffice, no real way to answer. He can only work harder, push his body further, shatter his ankle but keep going, keep trying to figure out how to live forever, if only to keep protecting his audience from the desperation and sadness of this real world. By giving them something to believe in. It’s all so goddamned beautiful. I love these movies.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","  Tom Cruise might be 56 years old but he shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, with the Mission: Impossible franchise, the Hollywood legend is actively going out his way to test his own boundaries with death-defying stunts.  In Ghost Protocol, he climbed the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. In Rogue Nation, he clung on to the outside of a plane as it took off. Now, as Ethan Hunt returns with IMF members Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), it becomes the deadliest and most thrilling mission yet, complete with jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring stunt work. It’s two years after the exploits of Rogue Nation and Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has been captured. Coinciding with this is the rise of the Apostles, a group of anarchists wanting to bring down the current world order using nuclear bombs. After a job goes awry and plutonium ends up in the hands of the enemy, Hunt and his team must try to broker a deal that involves the mysterious White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) using Lane as collateral in return for the plutonium. When a familiar face in the shape of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) gets involved, the mission to save a third of the world’s population becomes a twisting, thrilling, double-crossing race against time. Hunt’s job is made all the more difficult with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) being enlisted as “a hammer” to solve any problems.  Fallout’s first success is in being a direct sequel to Rogue Nation . We spent enough time in the preceding film to become invested in the characters, that we now get a chance to see how they all fare in the aftermath of that close call. Harris as Solomon Lane is a quietly sinister villain whose plotting involves getting revenge on Hunt. There’s personal stakes involved this time, giving a new dimension to the dynamics.  The films have always been entertaining when it’s IMF trying to stop someone doing something catastrophic. But it has rarely felt like there were real stakes involved. In fact, the last time we felt anything personal in the M:I films was when Hunt had to say his goodbyes to wife Julia(Michelle Monaghan). That all changes in Fallout. Director Chris McQuarrie understands that an action film requires more than a simple A-to-B plot line. It needs a hook upon which our investment will hang. In this case, Hunt’s past haunts him as he suffers numerous nightmares involving Lane and Julia. These ghosts play a larger part in Hunt’s overall arc as the film barrels head first into the finale. But the less audiences know about that, the better.  What film fans turn up to see in Mission: Impossible films are the action sequences. It’s a trip to experience Cruise’s latest practical stunts. They’ve become an intrinsic part of the franchise. In Fallout, he outdoes himself with some genuinely breathtaking moments. We have his HALO jump from 25,000ft into Paris, there’s also the high-speed helicopter chase through a mountain range. And there’s even a car, bike and foot chase that’ll leave you breathless.  The on-screen action is executed to perfection. The film barely pauses for breath during the near 150-minute run time. We barrel headfirst into the thick of it and McQuarrie understands such a film requires peaks and troughs for it all to be effective. Thankfully, when we do get a chance to pause for breath, it’s filled with unexpected emotional beats that get to heart of Hunt’s psyche. We discover what drives him beyond “saving the many”. In fact, as we approach the big finale, there’s a moment that will cause a sharp intake of breath. It’s a small moment but it has big implications for where we end up going. Cruise, as ever, gives it everything as he throws Hunt into the centre of a globe-spanning conspiracy theory. The fact he’s actually given some emotional moments is a welcome change of pace. We see, beyond the action man, that he’s doing things to help those closest to him. It’s also great to see the rest of the cast being given something more to do than simply being helpers for Hunt. Pegg’s Benji gets more than his fair share of screen time, Rhames brings some much-needed heart to proceedings and Ferguson as Ilsa is the mysterious badass who we all fell in love with in Rogue Nation. Cavill’s introduction as Walker is superb. He’s in beast mode for most of the film, most evident during an epic bathroom brawl. There’s a calm menace brought to the role that makes Walker more than just the muscle. And Harris’s Lane is the best villain since Philip Seymour Hoffman in M:I3. McQuarrie has helped the Mission: Impossible franchise flourish and grow beyond being standalone films. His understanding of what makes a good action film is front and centre throughout. However, what he has crafted with Fallout is nothing short of spectacular. This is a propulsive, heart-pounding masterpiece. It’s a rare beast for a Hollywood blockbuster to leave me speechless. Mission: Impossible - Fallout did exactly that. And more. It’s a non-stop rollercoaster and a towering achievement for McQuarrie and his cast and crew. Do not miss it!",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," Tom Cruise has at least done the improbable. With the release of Mission: Impossible - Fallout on Friday, the aging movie star will have played the same action role for 22 years. No reboots, no decade-long gaps; Mission: Impossible has a revolving door of secret-agent team members, but Tom Cruise and Ving Rhames have both appeared in every installment in what's now today's longest-running, same-continuity film series. Cruise even survived the brief moment when 2011's Ghost Protocol looked like an opportunity for him to hand the reins to Jeremy Renner. But you can't outlast Cruise. Renner appeared in the fifth film, Rogue Nation, but is absent from Mission: Impossible – Fallout, the new sixth entry. Much of the rest of the Rogue Nation cast is back — as is director Christopher McQuarrie, the first Mission director to re-up in what had been a seemingly intentionally ever-switching franchise. As talented as McQuarrie is, his return to the series doesn't make it his baby. Mostly it reaffirms the power of Tom Cruise, now somehow 56 years old. Cruise is not the movie star he was from his astonishing 20-year run, that period from 1986 through 2006 where he could do very little wrong at the box office, and worked with some of the industry's most talented filmmakers. Ironically, it was Mission: Impossible III that first dented his box-office armor, as that movie underperformed in the aftermath of his couch-jumping press tour the previous summer. Since then, he has, to some degree, retreated into his star persona, making far more genre films than he did in his prime. Some of the movies aren't as big, but he's made the Mission: Impossible series the centerpiece of this strategy. After working on some of Cruise's best later-period movies (co-writing Edge of Tomorrow; directing Jack Reacher), McQuarrie's loyalty has been rewarded with two Mission: Impossible pictures in a row, helping Cruise work out new ways to endanger his life on a film set. That's not to say that Fallout is ghost-directed by Cruise (though McQuarrie will tell stories of a helicopter sequence where logistics led to Cruise operating both the helicopter and the camera that's filming him). McQuarrie has his own style, giving his Missions a more shadowy, European texture than the pop of Brad Bird or the paranoid angles of Brian De Palma. Fallout goes even darker, with strategic bursts of color or brightness courtesy of new cinematographer Rob Hardy, who also shot Ex Machina and Annihilation. But with its resurgence, the series has also gradually become more serialized. Fallout reunites Cruise with his standard sidekicks Rhames and Simon Pegg, alongside wild card Rebecca Ferguson and even past bad guy Sean Harris; the only major addition to the field team is Henry Cavill, a welcome presence whose role nonetheless feels slightly utilitarian. To a far greater degree than normal, storylines from several previous installments are continued and (vaguely) resolved; the movie even revives the third movie's attempt to give Cruise's super-agent Ethan Hunt some inner emotional life. This is the first Mission: Impossible movie that features dream sequences. It is not, of course, the first Mission: Impossible movie to trade on Cruise's willingness to do anything for an impressive stunt, though that was not part of the original sell back in 1996. As the movies have become more frequent and serialized, they've also turned Cruise's stunts into a major attraction, his own impossible missions that the movies are constructed around. Here, he drops from an airplane, pilots and dangles from a helicopter, motorcycles through the streets (again), free-climbs (again), and, as ever, runs. This is not a complaint. McQuarrie stages these chases, fights, and literal cliffhangers with enough dazzling skill to put this summer's other live-action set-pieces to shame (the animated exception being series alum Brad Bird, dazzling in his own way throughout Incredibles 2), and Cruise commits to them with gusto. Even better, the movie is not wall-to-wall sensory overload; McQuarrie has the confidence to step back and let some scenes, like a meeting between Cruise and Ferguson or a pause before a hasty getaway, play out deliberately and carefully. For that matter, many of the action sequences have an ebb and flow, even in their excesses. Though long at two-and-a-half hours, the movie is beautifully orchestrated. If there's ever any muddle to Fallout, it comes not from the twistiness of the plot or the sometimes shadowy photography but rather the sense that Cruise is grasping for something his rapt audience can feel beyond the simple awe of watching eye-popping action scenes. It's to his credit as a movie star — as well as to the fine work of Ferguson, Rhames, and Pegg — that the movie even comes close to locating any humanity underneath the latex masks and espionage plotting. But it's not a strong point of the series. Cruise's Ethan Hunt remains relatively opaque, no matter how much he's supposed to love his ex-wife. His vulnerability comes not from a love story but the fact that he's a human dangling from a helicopter or jumping from rooftop to rooftop. Ultimately, the Mission: Impossible movies are not emotional experiences, but a visceral expression of Cruise's dogged desire to remain an action star. Even with top-notch filmmakers at the helm, he's become the true auteur of this series, a living monument to what he will do for his audience. It sounds arrogant on paper. But one of the movies' sharpest tricks is making the perpetual-motion machine of stardom so crazy exciting. Jesse Hassenger's film and culture criticism has appeared in The Onion's A.V.

"Jul 26, 2018"," “Fallout” reverberates with references dating back to the initial movie in the series, as Hunt and his Impossible Mission Force team battle adversaries old and new. This sixth “M.I.” plays like a feature on steroids. It gallops from set piece to set piece, from chase to chase and from stunt to stunt with hardly a let up. Forget the preposterous plot or the outlandish, over-the-top action and fight sequences; thanks to Cruise, director Christopher McQuarrie and their army of stunt personnel, “Fallout” is an adrenaline rush that, at times, keeps you on the edge of your seat. The plot is the tried-and-true IMF staple: a race against time to secure a deadly device, smash a terrorist organization and unmask the secretive leader of the gang. Honestly, though, it’s not the plot, but the infectious manner in which the cast and the filmmakers simply speed along not really worrying if any of it makes sense or is logical. Cruise, now closer to 60 than 50, has matured in the role. His boyish charm and looks are beginning to weather slightly, which gives him a more mature and masterful air of authority. And, bless him, Cruise should be an inspiration for any AARP member. He is the best runner in movies. When he begins to sprint, you are impressed by the clenched jaw, the legs churning like pistons and the arms propelling him forward. I am a member of the Indiana Film Journalists Association.

"Jul 26, 2018"," While
watching Mission:
Impossible  Fallout, it's inevitable
that you'll find yourself asking, ""How did they do that?"" Well, as
with the majority of the stunts and action sequences in this series, the answer
is more than likely that they actually did whatever you're watching. Yes,
this means that Tom Cruise actually performed a HALO (High Altitude, Low Open)
jump at about 30,000 feet. Yes, this means that Cruise leapt across rooftops for
a clever chase sequence (and, rather notably, broke his ankle during one
jumpthe effects of which we can see when he climbs the building and limps out
of frame). Yes, that's Cruise riding a motorcycle through the streets of Paris
at high speeds, and indeed, that's Cruise flying a helicopter through the
valleys and mountains of Kashmir. The
series, which shows little to no signs of slowing down by the end of this sixth
installment, came into its own with the fourth film, when it really started
pushing the limits of practical stunt work involving one of the most
recognizable movie stars in the world. As you might recall, Cruise climbed up
and ran down the Burj Khalifa, the tallest skyscraper in the world, in that one,
which seemed like the most dangerous thing that a movie star would be allowed to
do during a Hollywood production. Then
he hung on to the side of a plane as it took off in the fifth one, and we had to
be thinking that stunt would be limit. Here, we're pretty much assured that
Cruise and whatever filmmaker takes the reins of a given entry in this series
have no limits. Writer/director
Christopher McQuarrie makes no excuses for what he's doing here. The plot is,
perhaps, the most perfunctory of the series thus fara race against time to
stop a group of terrorists from detonating a pair of nuclear bombs. The
characters exist to explain and re-explain why they're going from one place to
the next in order to stop those terrorists and defuse those bombs. There are
some apparent betrayals and revelations of double agents here, because that's
what we expect in a spy story. Even those twists are so predictable that the
secret central villain might as well be wearing a sign that says, ""I'm the
bad guy,"" from his first appearance. It's
the first time in a while that one could say that an installment in this series
is routine and, at times, bordering on dull. We've seen the particulars of this
plot so many timeseven within the course of this franchisethat it'd be
tempting to say that McQuarrie isn't even trying. Then we get one of the film's
action sequences, and all of the routine, all of the familiar spy craft, all of
the redundant exposition, and all of the film's obvious shortcomings fade away. That's
the entire point, and in a way, this entry, while nowhere near the best of the
series, might serve as the perfect distillation of what we expect from a Mission: Impossible movie. McQuarrie basically has cobbled together
a greatest-hits compilation of familiar themesfrom an elaborate game of
tricking a bad guy into giving up key information to the constant feeling that
nobody can be trustedand action beats. We've seen the car chase and the
footrace and the shootout and Cruise's super-spy Ethan Hunt hanging from
assorted things too many times to recall in this series. Even though it was over
two decades ago, one might remember that Hunt went up against a helicopter in
the first film. The
plot and the characters are merely an excuse to get us to the spectacle. That
has been the case for this series for the past, now, three films, so we're used
to it. The excuse seems flimsier than ever in this entry, but to counterbalance
that fact, the spectacle is, perhaps, the best the series has cooked up so far.
We've seen it all before, but we haven't seen it done on this level, at this
scale, and with such obvious peril for everyone involved. The
plot itself has Hunt, as well as his team of Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji
(Simon Pegg), going after a trio of enriched plutonium cores. This eventually
means an elaborate plan to buy them off the black market. There are a couple of
returning charactersRebecca Ferguson's British spy of uncertain allegiance
Ilsa, Alec Baldwin as the head of the Impossible Missions Force, and Sean Harris
as the vengeance-seeking villain Laneand a few new facesHenry Cavill as
the brutish CIA agent Walker, Angela Bassett as the head of that agency, and
Vanessa Kirby as the black market broker. To
detail how they all fit into this story would be pointless, although Cavill,
whose character's tendencies toward torture and murder serve as an intriguing
juxtaposition to Hunt's smarter, often improvised means (""I'll figure it
out,"" he says repeatedly). There's a brutal fistfight in a public restroom
that destroys the place with some precise throws and vicious tackles, but for
the most part, the action has Hunt running, driving, jumping, climbing, and
flying his way toward stopping a nuclear catastrophe. To
give away the particulars of the action would be unfair and, also, difficult,
because McQuarrie fills these sequences with a lot of smaller stunts (relatively
speaking, of course) and visual gags. There are beats within the beats of each
and every action sequence. It's almost too much, but then again, since McQuarrie
ensures that we're only here for the action, it's just enough for Mission:
Impossible 
Fallout  to work.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," So it’s business as usual with Fallout,  the sixth installment in the ossified franchise series that seems more like the sixtieth, but despite the fact that after the night I saw it I failed to remember anything in it by breakfast the following morning, I am forced to (a) confess I had a good time watching it while it lasted, and (b) give Tom Cruise credit where it’s due. At 56, the ubiquitous superstar looks ageless. He produces his own pictures and doctors his own scripts, guaranteeing his fans that he will leap from rooftops and dangle from helicopters with his picket-fence teeth white as porcelain and his IMAX grin unmatched by anyone except Julia Roberts. Most remarkably, Cruise does most of his own stunts, including the film’s most thrilling sequence, when he jumps out of a plane at 25,000 feet with a real-life broken ankle. There is plenty to marvel at, and there you have it: the primary reason to sit through nearly 2 and ½ hours of Fallout without a Band-Aid in sight. MISSION : IMPOSSIBLE—FALLOUT  ★★★ 
(3/4 stars)
Directed by: Christopher McQuarrie
Written by: Christopher McQuarrie
Starring: Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Henry Cavill
Running time: 147 mins. Returning as implacable, indestructible, danger-seeking IMF (Impossible Mission Force) leader Ethan Hunt, Cruise is again joined by some of his old fellow agents (Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) and once again directed by Christopher McQuarrie, who called the shots on the top-grossing Rogue Nation. What passes for a plot leapfrogs from convoluted to preposterous, without making a word of logical sense. It’s full of red herrings, twists and false endings, with agents wearing Wolf Blitzer masks and villains like “The Widow”, a rich philanthropist whose charities camouflage her talent for money laundering. But what holds interest more than anything else are the helicopters, motorcycles, electric cars, and special effects. Anything resembling real people is accidental. What Ethan Hunt & Co. are tracking here is a syndicate of international terrorists called “The Apostles”, dedicated to destroying the world with plutonium bombs. The goal of the IMF is to find the nuclear weapons before they wipe out Jerusalem, Mecca, and the Vatican. To that end, the Mission Impossible gang is joined by a CIA agent to make their impossible mission more possible. If you don’t know this unwelcome watchdog, played by Henry Cavill, might turn out to be the Apostles’ star assassin, then you haven’t been paying attention. Cavill is actually more handsome than Cruise—calendar material, close-up ready, and charismatic enough to have already played Superman. But he’s no match for the eternally youthful star with good hair, taut workout abs, tight T-shirts and all the best camera angles, busily dispensing endless intensity without ever breaking a sweat or learning how to act. When Cavill finally confronts Cruise face-to-face with the snarling line “Why won’t you die?” the audience laughter at the critics’ screening I attended was entirely understandable. In the traffic explosions and car crashes, with the star behind the wheel, there is never so much as a stripped gear or a flat tire, and every tap on the shoulder with a briefcase sounds like a building collapse. From a dozen chases and pileups that wreak carnage on Belfast, Berlin, London and the boulevards of Paris, to a smallpox epidemic in the snowy mountains of Kashmir, Mission : Impossible—Fallout knocks itself out to keep you awake and entertained. The result is a film that won’t make a dent in cinema history but, with an ebullient gusto, it is impossible to resist. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Cuando Bruce Geller creó la serie televisiva Misión Imposible no podría haber imaginado que, más allá de su éxito catódico, su artefacto acabaría convertido en la saga de acción que mejor define el cine de atracciones del siglo XXI, porque, ¿qué es si no la franquicia protagonizada por el temerario Tom Cruise? El relato de espías que renació en 1999 con Brian de Palma como director de orquesta ha ido eliminando máscaras y a la vez creciendo en números de acción, redobles acrobáticos y desafíos a la muerte en una suerte de tour de force que es mejor no probar en casa. ¿Y qué podemos esperar de Misión: Imposible - Fallout, la ya sexta entrega de la serie fílmica, con un Cruise sobrepasando la cincuentena y con un ejercicio anterior, Nación secreta, rozando la perfección? Parecía imposible –valga la redundancia–, pero Christopher McQuarrie y Cruise han vuelto a superarse a sí mismos, porque Fallout es un divertidísimo circo acrobático (o una montaña rusa, según el gusto) pensado para aquellos que entienden el cine como una experiencia que corta la respiración.  No sólo el tándem formado por el cineasta y la estrella funciona a la perfección, sino que el entendimiento del actor con el resto de compañeros y compañeras le da un lustre único a este último episodio de la saga, a pesar de que su historia sea más una extensión narrativa del anterior filme que un relato propio. Los espectadores y las espectadoras que disfrutaron con Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) y Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) están de enhorabuena, porque ambos personajes regresan aquí para tratar de dar respuesta a algunas cuestiones que parece que no se concluyeron en el pasado. A estos regresos se les suma el genial personaje interpretado por Henry Cavill (y su cacareado bigote), además de los compañeros del FMI Benji (Simon Pegg) y Luther (Ving Rhames), más geniales (también) que nunca. No es algo baladí, porque el hecho de que los personajes tengan un arco y una entidad propia ayudan a que Ethan Hunt/ Cruise brille aún más. Suyos son los mejores sets de acción (no podía ser de otro modo) y, como viene siendo marca de la casa, los más arriesgados y siempre a pelo. Es literalmente un gustazo ver lo mucho que se expone Cruise en Fallout, quien en una suerte de émulo contemporáneo de Buster Keaton no tiene miedo a entregar su cuerpo al completo en pro del espectáculo.  Las concomitancias con el creador de El maquinista de la general (1925) no acaban ahí, y si hay que buscar un referente sin lugar a dudas lo más recomendable es mirar hacia el cine mudo de hace un siglo. Ver a Cruise derrapar en moto en París, perseguido por no-sé-cuantos vehículos policiales (sin ánimo de hacer spoiler, ese set piece parisino es de lo mejor de Misión: Imposible - Fallout), es sentir el impactante vértigo que podrían haber sentido en su día aquellos espectadores del alocado cine de los orígenes. Eso sí, a diferencia de los filmes de cine silente, Fallout es un triple salto mortal en la era de la imagen digital y del blockbuster CGI, algo que le da, si cabe, más envergadura y valor. Seguramente, estamos ante la película más superlativa de la saga.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt.  He and his team, a menagerie now reduced to Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), must exchange a rogue agent for stolen plutonium to prevent its use by a terrorist group known as The Apostles. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE sequels now arrive with such regularity (every 4-5 years) that I can’t recall what number this one is.  Like THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, it’s become a very expensive serial.  Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt.  He and his team, a menagerie now reduced to Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), must exchange a rogue agent for stolen plutonium to prevent its use by a terrorist group known as The Apostles. Brian De Palma’s 1996 screen take on Bruce Geller’s television series followed closely in the footsteps of Phil Alden Robinson’s sleeper hit, SNEAKERS—a light-footed spy thriller with touches of intrigue and comedy.  The genre shifted away from the cold-war sensibilities of Clancy/Le Carré in post-Schwarzenegger Hollywood, leaning more heavily on action and save-the-world plots.  Enter John Woo and an A-list of other action directors for the M:I sequels. The film achieves most of its near-intrigue by including elements recycled from De Palma’s smarter, inaugural entry in the franchise—conflicting priorities with a CIA agent (Henry Cavill as August Walker, the funniest cover name since Fat Bastard), an alluring, rich-as-shit broker played by a Vanessa—Kirby, in this case; the character is the grand-niece of the other Vanessa’s (Redgrave) Max.  The film contains every staple of every contemporary action film in the spy genre: the Deal Gone Bad, the Brokered Negotiation, the Nightclub Scene With Lasers, the Double-Cross and the Double-Double Cross. And who thought it would be a good idea to cast Tom Cruise against Henry Cavill?  Two black holes of charisma for the price of one!  Cavill is unbelievably handsome, but that just adds to the placidity of his acting.  The film tries, desperately, to testosteronify Cruise’s Hunt—casting him betwixt Kirby’s White Widow and Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust.   But it doesn’t really work.  All the sexual tension could have been squared between Cavill and Cruise, but two black holes don’t make a shining star. By contrast, what Christian Bale once described as Cruise’s “intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes” played well in De Palma’s M:I and Michael Mann’s COLLATERAL.  In both films, the story capitalized on Mr. Mapother’s soulless stare in characters appropriately lacking a moral center.  Watch the HBO documentary MANHUNT, about the CIA team that located Bin Laden, led by Marty Martin who was reportedly ejected from the Agency for, among other things, embezzling $6 million.  It’s a dirty job…  Ethan Hunt is played as an incorruptible man with an unwavering moral compass, when he should be less like Captain America and more like Vincent in Mann’s film. Cruise tries his damnedest to make sense of his macho brand in the 21st century against the more affable personalities in Luther and Benji, the exhaustion of keeping up the façade now visible in his 56-year old face.  I’m not arguing here that he’s old, but that the brand he’s built around himself is an anachronism… an anachronism that worked for his character arc in Doug Liman’s EDGE OF TOMORROW, because he had a competing personality against whom to push (a no-bullshit Emily Blunt). Aside from the familiar scaffolding, the film holds up well as an action piece, but the intrigue dissolves when we step outside the theater and read about the clandestine way 12 Russian military intelligence officers were caught in the act intefering in the 2016 U.S. Elections.  Truth isn’t just stranger than fiction, it’s also more terrifying and exhilarating… For the past year, it’s been the biggest show on Earth.  How do you compete with that?",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," But the exception to this seems to be Tom Cruise’s Mission: Impossible series. With each successive instalment (we’re now up to six), Cruise’s Ethan Hunt, who leads the secretive Impossible Missions Force (IMF) team, runs, jumps, dangles, flies and literally does whatever it takes to save the world from the latest baddie threatening to snuff us all out.  The stunts, which have grown increasingly more daring, have seen Cruise scaling tall buildings (M:I 4), holding his breath underwater for over three minutes (M:I 5), hanging on to the side of an A400 plane (M:I 5), climbing up the side of rocky cliffs (M:I 2), leaping off skyscrapers (M:I 3) and much more. The latest instalment — Fallout — opens today and it features the actor (now 56) engaging in some of the most spectacular action sequences ever to appear on a movie screen. The screenplay, penned by M:I 5 writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who won an Oscar for the Usual Suspects and is back in the director’s chair once again), is pretty standard. A group of evildoers known as the Apostles who are associates of the last movie’s villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), have stolen plutonium in order to build nukes that will bring death and destruction to some of the world’s holiest cities. Hunt manages to secure the plutonium at the beginning, but loses it saving one of his IMF teammates, which include the acerbic Luther (Ving Rhames) and the squirrelly Benji (Simon Pegg).  It’s now back to square one, and IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) and CIA head Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) force Hunt to add a new member, Walker (Henry Cavill), to his rescue operation. From there, Hunt’s reunited with former MI6 ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and the mysterious White Widow (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby) as he traverses some of Europe’s most stunning locales (you’ll immediately want to book a trip to Paris as soon as you walk out of the theatre) trying to stop the missing plutonium from getting into the wrong hands. Threading this all together is a series of stunts that deserve to be seen on the biggest screen possible. I’ve said that in other reviews, but if there’s one movie that I think requires you to splurge a little extra for Imax or something similar, it’s this one. First up, the much-talked about HALO (high altitude low opening) jump (that Cruise perfected over a hundred tries) that shows Hunt leaping out of a plane and skydiving his way onto the roof of Paris’ Grand Palais. That’s followed by a brutal bathroom fight alongside Walker. If you’re squeamish at the sight of blood, now might be a good time to look away. While in the City of Love, Hunt also tears up the streets in an expertly shot motorcycle chase that zips by some of Paris’ most famous landmarks. Then we’re in London (that’s another trip booked), where Hunt runs across rooftops. Cruise famously broke his ankle filming one of these scenes, and in an interview with the Sun, McQuarrie said that much of the actor’s sprint after that point was completed following his injury. The film’s climax takes place in Kashmir, with New Zealand and Norway’s Pulpit Rock standing in. Here, Cruise pilots a helicopter (yes, that’s him at the controls, no trickery here) and grasps perilously to the side of a mountain. We won’t spoil it, or even hint at what it is. But we get to see a rare moment of emotion from our steely hero, and McQuarrie and Cruise give some real insight into what has motivated Hunt these past 22 years and six movies.  In our interview with McQuarrie, he said that Cruise is already talking about making another Mission movie.“‘We can do better,’” he recounted the actor telling him after the premiere. But the boyish, superhuman star is now faced with perhaps his most impossible mission ever — topping the superb Mission: Impossible — Fallout.

"Jul 26, 2018"," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  Mission Impossible: Fallout does the improbable, maintaining its high level of action, suspense and casting in a sinewy plot that will get the pulse racing, writes Bruce DeMara. Mission Impossible: Fallout does the improbable, maintaining its high level of action, suspense and casting in a sinewy plot that will get the pulse racing, writes Bruce DeMara. Mission: Impossible — Fallout, the sixth instalment in the series, performs a highly improbable mission: maintaining a high level of quality in terms of inventive, well-executed action scenes, solid casting and down-to-the-wire suspense that will keep fans glued to their seats, even if the plotting is a bit more intricate than necessary. Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Usual Suspects (1995), finds himself back in the director’s chair after helming the last instalment, Rogue Nation, doing dual duty this time as screenwriter. It explains why the plot is so closely linked to M:I5 like so much unfinished business. In fact, there’s quite a lot of unfinished business here, including a love interest from M:I3 — but don’t worry, the movie does a decent job of catching up viewers who have understandably forgotten or skipped those earlier films. This time out, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his truncated IMF team of Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are tasked with recovering three plutonium cores stolen by a mysterious terrorist group called The Apostles, led by the unknown John Lark. Solomon Lane, a rogue spy and chief villain who was captured in the previous film, is still actively involved in a plot to wreak maximum nuclear havoc on the world. Complicating matters is the return of Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), Ethan’s love interest from Rogue Nation whose loyalties are divided, and the assignment of a CIA agent (Man of Steel’s Henry Cavill) to monitor the IMF team who makes no secret of his disdain for Hunt. Yes, it’s all rather complicated and requires a fair degree of attention to weave all the plot threads. Few big-name Hollywood actors carry the kind of baggage Cruise does but no one can doubt his commitment to the series, both as an actor and quasi-stunt man — breaking an ankle while filming a rooftop jump this time around. Cruise plays Ethan with a carefully calibrated intensity that works. There’s a fine camaraderie amongst old buddies Luther and Benji, and Pegg also gets to do a bit more action here than his usual computer gymnastics. Both have grown rather lovable in their roles. There’s a solid supporting cast across the board, including Ferguson as the fierce but enigmatic Ilsa, and Sean Harris, reprising his role as Solomon Lane, projects a twinkly eyed fanaticism that’s effectively creepy. The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby does a fine kittenish femme fatale as an arms dealer named the White Widow, and Cavill, as Walker, provides a brawny alpha male counterpart to Hunt. But much of the movie’s appeal comes down to the ever-spectacular chase sequences, and there’s plenty of them this — Fallout clocks in at more than two hours — although it’s a bit disappointing to see the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and London’s St. Paul’s Cathedral used as backdrops for the action, after being treated to considerably more exotic locales in earlier outings. The final showdown, set in the remote Himalayan region of Kashmir (although filmed in New Zealand), is excruciating suspenseful, providing a satisfying climax to a film that manages to score a place as one of the best M:I outings yet.

"Jul 26, 2018"," And so, fellow moviegoers: Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what Tom Cruise can — and will — do for you. The answer is anything. The man will do anything to entertain you. At age 56, when the rest of us are making chiropractor appointments and upping our corrective lenses, Cruise will jump out of a plane for you, into a lightning storm. He’ll learn to fly a helicopter for you, all for one nausea-inducing helicopter piloting stunt — yep, he’s piloting AND acting — that sends him into a death spiral in “Mission: Impossible - Fallout .” It should go without saying that Cruise will hang off a sheer cliff for you. Oh, also: he will dangle off a rope from a helicopter, then bungee jump off it for you. And finally, Mr. Cruise will shatter his ankle jumping from one building to another for you — and then sprint like hell on that broken ankle. Because, what’s an MI film without a Cruise sprint? One day, if this continues, it will surely seem silly. One day, people will chuckle sympathetically at the exploits of this well-meaning but wrinkled movie star, perhaps in his 80s then, putting his life in danger to please his fans. Now, though, is not that day. With his partner, returning director-writer Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise delivers all the above in the ridiculously entertaining “Fallout,” his sixth outing as Ethan Hunt. As for the plot, well, you may chuckle in confusion. It gets unnecessarily complicated. For most movies, this would be a much bigger problem. But because “Fallout” moves so quickly from one crazy stunt to another, it doesn’t matter. You’ll think, “Hmm, what?” But then, “Whoa! Is Tom about to jump off that building?” We begin, as always, with a new mission — this time, it arrives in a hollowed-out copy of Homer’s “Odyssey,” perhaps a reference to Hunt’s own journey. We’ll try to boil it down: The evildoers are the Apostles, terrorists who aim to nuke the world’s top religious sites — the Vatican, Jerusalem and Mecca — and bring on an apocalypse. They’re in league with Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the criminal mastermind from the last film, who stayed alive and now wants revenge against Hunt, not to mention the global destruction thing. Hunt must get his hands on three missing plutonium cores. He actually manages this, for a second — but has to give them up to save a cherished team member. Thus is launched an overarching dilemma of this installment: Should Hunt save one life that is dear to him over millions of others? We don’t get much time to ponder. Hunt has to start from scratch. His IMF team includes, as always, loyal Luther (Ving Rhames), and tech whiz Benji (the wonderful Simon Pegg), who provides needed levity. It’s safe to say that never before has Benji’s life hung so precariously in the balance. IMF secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) is back, clashing with Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett), certainly the most stylish person ever to head the CIA, onscreen or off. Sloane forcibly injects her own agent, the very handsome but shady Walker (Henry Cavill), into Hunt’s operation, causing all sorts of complications. Crucially, we also have former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson, who made such an impression in the last film). She’s back, but working for whom, exactly? Regardless, it’s fun to watch her take down a succession of brutish men. A welcome newcomer is Vanessa Kirby (“The Crown”) as the mysterious White Widow. Of course, it’s the stunts that really matter. And the scenery. Paris has always been beautiful, but there’s a certain frisson you get when arriving with Cruise by way of a plummet from a plane onto the roof of the Grand Palais. And that motorcycle chase around the Arc de Triomphe? Let’s just say that getting through that traffic circle alive on a real-life day is a Mission: Impossible. Then we’re off to London, where Cruise shattered his ankle bone filming a rooftop chase. At a recent screening, McQuarrie explained that most of what we see the actor doing here, including that sprint, was done after the injury. Feel free to consider that as you watch. The most dramatic stunts were filmed in New Zealand, standing in for Kashmir. Many people go bungee-jumping there; probably relatively few do it from a moving helicopter. We also see Cruise piloting another helicopter into a seemingly irreversible plunge. A climactic physical fight was shot in Norway, on a cliff that drops into a fjord. And Cruise’s 25,000-foot jump from a plane was filmed in Abu Dhabi.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Itâs amazing to think that this is the sixth installment of the Mission: Impossible film franchise. The first movie, originally released in 1996, was a singular attempt to adapt the original series, which at that point had been off the air for 23 years. But audiences gravitated to the series and now, 22 years after the premiere of the first film weâve got Mission: Impossible â Fallout. The first direct sequel in the franchise â connecting to 2015âs M:I film, Rogue NationÂ âÂ Fallout adheres to everything audiences have come to expect from the series: Tom Cruise continues to do impossible stunts, characters allegiances are tested, and the plot is so twisted itâs starting to fuse on itself. But, like Cruiseâs Ethan Hunt, we choose to accept the mission, leading to some breathtaking cinematography and an experience thatâs pure popcorn fare. Acclaimed IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is tasked with tracking down missing plutonium set to be obtained by a group of extremists known as the Apostles. Because the leader of the Apostles is a rogue agent, Hunt must masquerade as the man, only to be implicated in the plot himself. With time short, Hunt and his team must root out the mole, obtain the plutonium, and save the world. Just writing down that plot was a lesson in paying attention. Like several of the last few Mission: Impossible movies, Fallout insists on dumping a mountain of plot information in one go before boiling it down to one key McGuffin. In this case, the audience is inundated with buzzwords like âSyndicate,â âApostlesâ and âJohn Larkâ in a narrative that includes everything from mad doctors to splinter cells. But whatâs relevant is that plutonium is involved and Ethan Hunt needs to get it. Thus kicks off a two-and-a-half chase to dismantle a bomb that, thankfully, is suspenseful enough to keep things flowing. At 56-years-old thereâs no stopping Tom Cruise. Literally, the man runs, climbs, drives, and motorcycles as hard as a man 30 years his junior. Much of what propels Fallout are the action set-pieces that showcase Cruiseâs machismo and agility. This go-round Hunt is teamed up with August Wilson (Henry Cavill plus mustache), a physically intimidating specimen of a man tasked with keeping an eye on Hunt.Â The movie doesnât make a point of stating Cavill is more physically brutal than Hunt, but thatâs a subplot of the feature. Wilson sees the Impossible Missions Force as a fairy tale about âmen in masksâ who see hope as a strategy when it isnât. As Angela Bassettâs Erica Sloan says of him, Wilson is âthe hammerâ and boy is he. Itâs evident early on what his role in the filmâs endgame is, and itâs hard to buy overall, but Cavill proves he can be a compelling character when given good material. If anything, Fallout sees to draw inspiration from one of Cavillâs own movies, the underrated Man From U.N.C.L.E, itself a flashy remake of a â60s television series. The trailers have done a great job of hyping the filmâs first major set-up, involving Cavill and Cruise in a bathroom. The trailer does a fantastic job of whetting the appetite without giving anything away. Make no mistake, this scene is brutal and is a high-octane moment where you feel every wall throw and sink punch. Kudos to the sound mix for emphasizing the impact here, though this is a movie where death has little meaning. Case in point, the third act involves a game of chicken with helicopters that plays like the worst game of Mouse Trap. Suffice it to say, youâll have a hard time believing Tom Cruise isnât a zombie. And Cruise certainly does well here, though considering this is his sixth outing with the character, heâs not required to do too much. The majority of his screentime sees him engaging in action, so itâs hard to say he gives much of a performance. If anything you honor his commitment to his craft. Cruise has been vocal about doing his own stunts in this series, and unlike other action movies where a stunt double is evident, itâs obvious Cruise is the one riding the motorcycle or jumping onto roofs (breaking his foot in the process). He does have a moment of tenderness with his former wife, Julia (played by Michelle Monaghan) towards the end. Hunt is a man who, like James Bond, has had a new woman in every film and this is the first time the movie has made a point of mentioning the characterâs love for a woman long-term. Julia, who was missing from the previous film, returns to leave Hunt wondering what might have been, and what could be with MI-6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). The movie doesnât weigh down the already heavy plot with a love triangle, instead placing it on the fringes. Julia and Ilsa meet and converse, but thereâs never any sense of competition or animosity. Fergusonâs character, especially, holds her own in the gunplay and other action that happens around her. Sheâs complemented by Vanessa Kirbyâs evil, White Widow whoâs as beautiful as she is remorseless. âThe world needs the IMFâ but it remains to be seen how the IMF can keep up in this world for a seventh feature that seems all but inevitable. As it stands now, Mission: ImpossibleÂ â Fallout is the most emblematic of the entire series. If youâve watched this one, odds are youâve watched all the previous ones. At times this feels like the most formulaic, but it is entertaining and keeps you enthralled with the magnificent set pieces. Just donât anticipate being able to distinguish this from Rogue Nation.

"Jul 26, 2018"," The IMF's quarry is a mysterious anarchist calling himself ""John Lark,"" a nuclear terrorist who has wrought a long, tedious manifesto about the importance of purging the Earth through suffering. By contrast Mission: Impossible—Fallout gives one nothing to suffer over except for the winching of nerves during one of its expert fight sequences, it's rousing soundtrack by Lorne Balfe and it's soaring mountain and cityscapes. This time Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must retrieve three plutonium spheres from what's left of the Syndicate of Solomon Lane (the Eli Wallach-like Sean Harris). Hunt is forcibly saddled with Walker (Henry Cavill) a hard-on from the CIA. Betrayal is in the wings as both Langley and MI-6 interfere with the game. Hunt is on more rooftops than Spider-Man, crawling around the dome of St. Paul's, the tower of the former Bankside Power Station, and the glass-roofed Grand Palais in Paris. Nothing takes the ennui out of what critic Edmund Wilson called ""Europe strutting its same old stuff"" like unleashing the spies on these monuments. The motorcycle and car chases are at a new level of brilliantly orchestrated chaos—a motorcycle donuting around a five sided Parisian square and seeing hoards of cops barricading every street emptying into it; the sky shell-pink and ravishing as every cop in France chases the IMF. And the stunts! Consider 15 seconds of this: a biker T-boning the side of a large truck and somersaulting to the pavement. Watch and remember the renowned stuntman, Dar Robinson, who died doing such a seemingly simple flip.  Hunt's IMF contains, as always, Ving Rhames dripping with humanity, and expert comedy relief from Simon Pegg, getting the jitters before yet another dangerous impostiture. The finale, a helicopter chase through the Himalayas with every warning button flashing, ends with a cliffhanger worthy of the term. You could say that Mission: Impossible—Fallout has everything you'd want from a spy movie, but it wouldn't be correct. What's missing, probably in the name of realism, is the elegance of the Bonds—the luxury side, the pauses for dinner. Vanessa Kirby, a stunner, turns up as some sort of wealthy but unsavory financier with a knife in her garter belt. And then she's gone. Shuttled off to the side, she has to give Hunt a weird quick goodbye kiss instead of the proper wining, dining and quip-trading she could have expected from 007.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2018"," Watching Mission: Impossible — Fallout made me feel like I was seeing a 56-year-old man’s midlife crisis dialing 911. I can’t be the only one who feels this way, can I? The sixth film in the spy series features numerous shots that make it clear that Tom Cruise really is scaling a rock face 2,000 feet in the air and driving a motorcycle at high speed against traffic around the Arc de Triomphe. Unseemly as it all might be, it doesn’t lessen my admiration for him, nor my awareness that most men half his age couldn’t hope to duplicate his physical feats. Yet for all that, having it unfold before your eyes is like having your uncle roll up in a new Ferrari with new hair transplants. It’s like, Dude, you’d be cooler if you didn’t try so damn hard. The story picks up where Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation left off, for those of you who care about continuity in this series. (And if you do, who are you?) With their leader Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) in prison, his terrorist network has become a mercenary army, and Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF team screw up a job that results in the organization gaining control of a plutonium shipment capable of unleashing a nuclear holocaust. Getting it back from a shadowy arms dealer named John Lark involves making pawns of both Lane and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the MI6 agent who’s still considered a threat by her own government and who shoots at Ethan an awful lot for someone who’s supposed to be on his side. Meanwhile, the captive Lane is running his own plot to exact revenge on Ethan and everyone he cares about, and one of the other villains asks Lane, “Why’d you have to make it so fucking complicated?” My feelings exactly. (Also, didn’t Lane see the first movie back in 1996? Ethan has already been made to watch helplessly while all his friends were killed. He got over it.) Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie is on his second tour with the series, and he’s strongest on the most important aspect of these films, which is the stuntwork. Early on, there’s a one-take shot with Ethan and a CIA tagalong named Walker (Henry Cavill) jumping out of a plane and encountering difficulties because they’re dumb enough to execute a parachute jump in the middle of a lightning storm. I like the fight choreography in a men’s room when Ethan and Walker try to apprehend Lark (Liang Yang), and the short-statured businessman kicks both their asses pretty good before a fourth party intervenes. This series isn’t much more than its action set pieces at this point, but unlike the Fast and the Furious franchise, the stunts feel somewhat rooted in reality, partly because you know it’s Cruise actually doing many of them. In addition to his stunts, Cavill, who hasn’t shown much star charisma in his lead roles, seems much more comfortable here as the good guy who’s such a douche that he might actually be a bad guy. Fellow Brit Vanessa Kirby (from TV’s The Crown) is a nice pickup for the series, too, as a billionaire philanthropist who’s handy with a switchblade. Forget the oh-so-convenient flaw in Lane’s nuclear bomb mechanics or the climactic struggle where the detonator keeps getting kicked to a place where Ethan can reach it. Where the movie falls down is the parts when McQuarrie tries to connect emotionally, as Ethan finds his ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan) in danger from Lane and his cohorts. The character development that follows makes sense on an intellectual level, but it doesn’t land, and neither McQuarrie nor the Mission: Impossible movies were put here to tug at our heartstrings. From the beginning, this series has been at its best when it abandons logic and just suspends Tom Cruise on a wire a couple of inches above the floor or has him rappel down the side of the Burj Khalifa or lets him battle three assassins backstage at the Wiener Staatsoper. To the large extent that Mission: Impossible — Fallout delivers on that, it’s a success. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," PLOT:  To prevent three nuclear warheads from being detonated by a rogue faction called The Apostles, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) must use arch-enemy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) as a bargaining chip, putting him into conflict with former ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). REVIEW:  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE is the rare film series where, without exception, the latest film always improves upon its predecessor in terms of action and spectacle. People thought MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE was too slow? Enter MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II with motorcycles, doves and John Woo. Was that too silly? Enter MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE: III with constant pulse-pounding cliffhangers. Was that too low-key? Cue GHOST PROTOCOL, with huge IMAX set pieces. Was that too gimmicky? Enter the lo-fi, grounded ROGUE NATION. Now, with ROGUE NATION’s Christopher McQuarrie the only director ever to return for a second film (although III’s J.J Abrams has remained on-board as a producer), MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT improves on all the other entries to such a degree that to follow-it-up just might be impossible. I had the same feeling watching FALLOUT that I did watching MAD MAX: FURY ROAD. Everything conceivable had been put on-screen in a go-for-broke effort. Star Tom Cruise throws himself into this one like it’s going to be the last action film he ever makes, and that “I’ll thrill you or die trying” attitude makes this one of the most perfectly conceived blockbusters in recent memory. Unlike some of the others, FALLOUT is a direct sequel to ROGUE NATION, with Hunt still plagued by nightmares about his encounter with Kane, including premonitions of his beloved ex-wife Julia (a returning Michelle Monaghan) dying in an apocalyptic blast. From there we’re off to the races, with a plutonium handover gone wrong leading to a series of ingenious fake-outs and face mask gags that seem plucked right from the TV show that inspired the franchise in the first place. In a smart move, the action scenes don’t kick in right away as in previous installments. Instead, McQuarrie gives the audience a moment to take a breath before kicking things off with a Halo jump over Paris that ends with an amazing hand-to-hand fight in a men’s room where Cruise and Cavill tangle with an insanely skilled opponent – an action beat that rivals anything in THE RAID. My issue with GHOST PROTOCOL and ROGUE NATION was that the first two-thirds were always so chockfull of action that by the time the climax hit, there was no way they could possibly top what came before. FALLOUT contains just as much, if not more, action leading to the climax, but the most insane, over the top action scene is wisely left to just before the credits roll, being the crazy helicopter chase teased by the IMAX posters. Before that, we get a harrowing motorcycle chase (on part with the one in ROGUE NATION) and dangerous looking rooftop stunts, in which Cruise actually injured himself badly enough to cause a several month production shutdown (meaning a CGI’d de-mustached Cavill in JUSTICE LEAGUE). McQuarrie’s action craft has been good from the start, even as far back as THE WAY OF THE GUN, but he outdoes himself here. The wide-lens cinematography (with changing IMAX aspect ratios) by Rob Hardy and the score by Lorne Balfe give this a Christopher Nolan vibe, albeit with the grounded action that’s becoming McQuarrie’s staple. Pretty much every other film in the franchise gets a nod (even the first – with Vanessa Kirby’s White Widow tied to Vanessa Redgrave’s arms-dealer, Max), with Simon Pegg back as sidekick Benji Dunn, while Ving Rhames has his biggest part since the third film, being out in the field with Hunt throughout. Even Alec Baldwin gets in on the action a bit (although Jeremy Renner sits this one out). ROGUE NATION’s breakout star, Rebecca Ferguson is back as Ilsa, with the film doing a good job of further exploring their relationship and flirtation, with her the only close colleague he’s been involved with that doesn’t need protecting. Michelle Monaghan makes a welcome return as Julie, in a smallish part (although bigger than in GHOST PROTOCOL), while Henry Cavill stacks up well opposite Cruise as the newest member of the team, whose loyalties are never clear. For the first time ever, Cruise has a semi-opponent that seems like a legitimate threat to him on a physical level, another thing that gives this an edge over the rest of the series. In many ways, FALLOUT feels like the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE movie Cruise has been building towards since 1996. Always one of the most entertaining franchises, FALLOUT is a textbook example of big-budget filmmaking where the creators have clearly perfected a formula and decided to go all-out. It’s one of those perfect modern blockbusters like THE DARK KNIGHT, CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER, SKYFALL, and MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, which perfectly illustrates just how good a movie like this could be. You’ll be eager for another MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE as soon as credits roll, but if Cruise and company were to call it a day, you couldn’t blame them. This will be near impossible to top – although if anyone can manage Cruise can. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," En una época saturada de secuelas, precuelas, spin-offs y remakes es un raro placer dar con la sexta entrega de una franquicia que no ha perdido la energía de la original. Quizás se debe a la versatilidad de la serie iniciada con Misión Imposible (Mission Impossible, 1996). Comparando las primeras tres películas, cada una ha sido estética y estilísticamente moldeada por su director: el suspense hitchcockiano de Brian De Palma, la desmesurada idolatría de John Woo, la economía televisiva de J.J. Abrams. La maleabilidad de la serie ha sido uno de sus mayores fuertes porque la ha mantenido fresca al contar, una y otra vez, la misma historia. Misión Imposible: Repercusión es lo más parecido que la serie ha tenido a una secuela directa, importando al villano de la película anterior (Sean Harris), varios personajes recurrentes a modo de relevo cómico cosechados a lo largo de toda la serie (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Alec Baldwin) y no menos de dos intereses románticos (Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Monaghan), todos organizados entorno a la figura del súper espía Ethan Hunt (Cruise) en clave idólatra. Buenos y malos concuerdan en diálogos que pecan de autocomplacientes y rozan la parodia: Hunt es lo mejor que les ha pasado en la vida. Si Ethan Hunt merece la simpatía del público es porque Cruise no tiene problema tanto en desafiar como humillar las limitaciones físicas de su personaje. Quizás este intento de homogeneizar la franquicia barajando personajes y subtramas recurrentes es en respuesta a la popularidad de los “universos cinematográficos” del día de hoy. En algunos casos el proceso se nota forzado, como la repentina inclusión del personaje de Monaghan que insiste en saldar deudas emocionales que, de acuerdo a las últimas dos películas, no tiene. En otros casos son productos geniales, como el fantástico homenaje a Vanessa Redgrave (la vil Max de la primera película) que compone Vanessa Kirby. La realidad es que el ridículo es parte de la gracia de estas películas, que son tanto una celebración a sí mismas como a un género de cine en particular. Escrita y dirigida nuevamente por Christopher McQuarrie, las escenas de acción son realizadas con el tipo de claridad y creatividad espacial típicamente reservadas para el reino de la animación. La producción es elegante, la cámara tajante, el montaje intenso. La acción ha decrecido en escala (como claramente anuncia la hazaña introductoria) pero las escenas poseen una forma fluida de conectarse entre sí, de transformarse viñeta a viñeta en tono y forma de acuerdo a las necesidades de la trama. Mad Max: Furia en el camino (Mad Max: Fury Road, 2015) es una buena comparación en términos de ritmo y visceralidad. Misión Imposible: Repercusión no es particularmente ambiciosa ni muy diferente a las últimas dos películas de la serie. Una séptima entrega probablemente necesite sacudir las cosas de nuevo. Pero fue fácil decirlo cuando se estrenó Mad Max: Furia en el camino y “Repercusión” lo hace igual de fácil: he aquí la mejor película de acción del año.",POSITIVE

 Tick, tick, tick, tick … but wait! Bombs in the digital age don’t make that sound as they count down. Luckily, they still have wires to clip — is it the red one or the blue one? Otherwise “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” would be ever so boring. Who am I kidding? “Fallout” couldn’t be boring if it tried. This mission, should you choose to accept it — c’mon, I had to go there — will keep you on the edge of your seat, sometimes with a hand clamped over your eyes, as gunbattle after chase sequence after fight sequence rains down. Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in the sixth outing of the movie based on the 1960s TV show. Hunt, an agent of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF), is after plutonium. The goal is to keep it out of the hands of a terrorist group known as the Apostles, but something goes wrong and the plutonium is snatched away. Hunt and his team regroup and go after it — with mayhem close behind. Along the way, Hunt partners, unwillingly, with August Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA operative, and a few important people from Hunt’s past show up, most notably Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson reprising her role in 2015’s “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation). There are crosses and double-crosses and twists and turns galore. Hunt’s occasional go-it-alone attitude is a little cheesy, as is some of the dialogue and the White Widow’s (Vanessa Kirby, most recently as Princess Margaret in “The Crown”) need to change into lingerie right after nearly being killed at a party and right before taking a meeting with Hunt and her henchmen. But the cheese went down just fine, the little morsels welcome downtime between action sequences. The action is virtually nonstop. Just when you think there can’t possibly be more crazy stunts, more crazy stunts arrive. Motorcycles, helicopters, chases across the tops of buildings, skydiving, a battle in a men’s restroom — it builds and builds until the end finally arrives. Then you wish it would start all over again. Related Articles

Bringing in Superman was a great casting idea. Cavill nicely sidesteps the superhero’s shadow and provides interesting contrast — physically and otherwise — to Cruise. And he’s good with the aside. When Hunt says he hopes a particular plan will work, Walker replies, “Hope is not a strategy.” But Ilsa Faust gets the last laugh when she says, “You must be new here.” Hunt has his team — Ferguson, Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn, Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell  — who provide much of the humor, but really, all of this rides on Cruise’s shoulders. Yes, he’s probably getting a wee bit long in the tooth for this kind of flick, but he pulls it off — and then some. Where he gets the energy is a mystery, but he’s all in, an unstoppable force.

"Jul 26, 2018"," “Hi! Tom Cruise is five years older in ‘Mission: Impossible — Fallout’ than Wilford Brimley was in ‘Cocoon’! I don’t know what to do with this information, and now, neither do you.” – Tweet from Tim Carvell, executive producer of “Last Week Tonight.” We are 22 years and six movies into the “Mission: Impossible” movies. “Fallout” just might be the best of the franchise, and what a rare thing that is for a long-running series. The “Mission: Impossible” TV show (which ran from 1966-1973), created by Bruce Geller, and to a small extent the first movie in 1996 focused on the Impossible Missions Force (IMF). But a Tom Cruise action movie is always gonna be a TOM CRUISE action movie, and though Cruise shares screen time with a dozen terrific actors and Ethan Hunt still works with a team and ostensibly takes orders from the IMF secretary (Alec Baldwin), one can’t resist drawing comparisons between “Fallout” and the latter-day James Bond films — and Cruise is up to the task, turning in a big-time movie star performance as a man who goes through life carrying an explosive mix of physicality, world-weary cynicism, loyalty to those loyal to him and an almost suicidal willingness to do anything to defeat evil.’ If the American Ethan Hunt ran into the Brit James Bond in some dive bar in the middle of nowhere, they could drink the night away sharing stories about Life on the Rogue. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (who directed “Rogue Nation”) is a talented storyteller with an Oscar on his shelf for his screenplay for “The Usual Suspects.” No surprise “Fallout” is packed with a dizzying array of twists and turns and double- and triple-crosses, some of them genuinely surprising and some you can see coming right down the aisle of your multiplex. (An early “Aha!” moment is loads of fun, but is set up in way that makes it nearly impossible, so to speak, for it NOT to play out the way it plays out.) This time around, Hunt is tasked with stopping the mysterious anarchist/arms dealer “John Lark” and his team of terrorists, known as the Apostles, before they get their hands on three nuclear devices. Whether it’s superhero movies or “real-world” international thrillers, there’s always some megalomaniacal villain who believes blowing things up will somehow lead to a new and better world. Come on, villains. Think it through! Cruise’s Hunt is rarely off-screen, and the non-action moments are primarily about Ethan’s haunting dreams of his beloved Julia (Michelle Monaghan), but “Fallout” does benefit from a deep and talented cast of supporting players. Sean Harris returns as the former IMF agent turned anarchist with a thirst for revenge against Ethan. Rebecca Ferguson is back as the assassin Ilsa Faust, who still has feelings for Ethan but is on her own mission that could result in a tragic confrontation. Ving Rhames adds heart and Simon Pegg provides comic relief as Ethan’s ever-loyal sidekicks. The great Angela Bassett is stuck with a thankless role as the director of the CIA, who apparently hasn’t seen the first five “Mission: Impossible” movies and is deeply suspicious of Hunt. Vanessa Kirby from “The Crown” is dangerous and sexy as “The White Widow,” a high-society arms broker who’s deadly with a butterfly knife. And then there’s Henry “Superman” Cavill as August Walker, a robotically efficient CIA assassin who becomes Ethan’s partner of sorts, much to their mutual chagrin. Cavill isn’t the most demonstrative of actors, but I found his style perfectly suited to the role of Walker, who is so utterly and completely able to compartmentalize any trace of humanity, he’s like a deadpan Terminator with a ‘stache. (The moment when Walker “reloads” his arms before re-entering a close-quarters fight is priceless, and has become an Internet meme.) At times it’s a real challenge to keep track of all the players and their motivations over the two-hour-27-minute running time; even the movie seems to forget about certain characters and plot points that were given prominent play early on. But there’s nary a dull moment as Hunt’s mission has him racing through the streets of Paris on a BMW motorcycle; jumping from building to building in London in a mad dash that winds up at the top of the Tate Modern; entering a helicopter mid-air (don’t ask) and engaging in an insane dogfight with another copter pilot, and getting mixed up in all manner of close-combat confrontations. Of course there’s a generous helping of impressive CGI along the way, but kudos to director McQuarrie, the stunt coordinators and stunt players and the adventurous cast for the numerous “practical effects,” which make even the most outlandish sequences more involving and more exciting. (Cruise famously broke his ankle in the London chase sequence, resulting in a two-month production shutdown). Paramount Pictures presents a film directed by Christopher McQuarrie and written by McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman. Rated PG-13 (for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language). Running time: 147 minutes. Opens Friday at local theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," 
The popular espionage/action franchise has once again lit that iconic fuse on one the best entries into the series (and Cruise just broke his ankle this time, hopping across Parisian buildings, which to any normal person is equivalent to the occupational hazard of a co-worker swiping the last breakfast taco because you didnât get there in time: an annoying inconvenience).
 
Writer/director McQuarrieâs second foray at the helm picks up directly after 2015âs Rogue Nation, and while most of these films operate on their own, this is a direct sequel (go ahead and count the mediocre Ghost Protocol, I dare you). Hunt and his team are after the Apostles, a terrorist group that formed in the vacuum of the capture of British spy-turned-anarchist Solomon Lane (Harris). The group is trying to get their hands on three plutonium cores to fashion nuclear bombs, targeting the religious holy sites of the Vatican City, Mecca, and Jerusalem. They strive for a new world order, but one wonders what that exactly looks like insofar as, you know, the day to day. Itâs not really explained, mostly described with this bon mot that âthe greater the suffering, the greater the peace,â or something along those lines (I just want to know my anarchic health care options). A deal gone wrong concerning said plutonium cores opens the film, with Hunt having to decide between securing the radioactive element or saving trusty team member Luther (Rhames). He chooses the latter, which becomes one of the main through lines in the film, a theme involving the hard choice of saving one life over many, and much discussion, albeit all incredibly opaque, as to what is the better course of action, ensues. You better believe the film has it both ways. Joining Hunt, Luther, now-seasoned field agent Benji Dunn (Pegg, comic relief revealing itself in its final form), and Ilsa Faust (Ferguson, in a very welcome reprisal to her MI6 agent), is CIA agent August Walker (Cavill), assigned into the team as a watchdog, and to make sure things donât go sideways. Well, they do: They go sideways in Paris, they go sideways in London, and they go sideways basically every 20 minutes or so. McQuarrie distills those overbearing plot machinations down as much as he can to good effect, but it is greatly assisted by Rob Hardyâs fluid and kinetic cinematography. There are set-pieces in this film, especially the last 30 minutes, that set the bar for big-budget, rich-people-entertaining-you-with-their-own-stunts spectacle. Add to that the fact that no one in the film menacingly asked âWhereâs the disk?â and you have a winner here.

"Jul 26, 2018"," By now you know what to expect from Mission: Impossible movies. Daredevil action scenes. Breakneck speeds. Cunning espionage. Inventive direction. Top production quality. Spot-on performances. Mission: Impossible — Fallen doesn’t reinvent the wheel.  It just ups the ante, intensifies all the elements and makes everything look bigger—like you’re looking at life through a microscope. And that closeup perspective gets blown out of proportion if you watch this 2h 27 min action/adventure/thriller in an IMAX theater. Do that and you’ll need to chug a bottle of Dramamine. Tom Cruise is wise to stick to this franchise. He’s had dubious success in other recent ventures (The Mummy, American Made). MI is his security blanket. He shines in them. He likes to perform outlandish action stunts that would make extreme sports athletes piss their pants. He’s equally deft at displaying that humble but dare-me air that is so integral to his covert operative persona. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is on the outs with the head of the CIA, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Hunt and his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) crew, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), have fumbled a very important task: Retrieve nuke devices and save the world. He’s out to control the damage, save his rep and do the right thing.  It won’t be easy. Sloan has taken a tough stance, she slams the famous agent and enlists a new operative, August Walker (Henry Cavill, aka Superman). “This is the CIA’s mission,” she says furiously. “If he had held on to the plutonium, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.” Sloan sends Walker as an emissary on Hunt’s new quest. Ethan doesn’t trust the dude. He shouldn’t. The plot by writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation) uses elements from former MIs, yet this script is also a self-contained entity. It takes its participants to Paris, London and Kashmir among other places. The exquisite locales, from bustling cities to picturesque mountain ranges, provide a varied playground for car chases, helicopter battles, perilous parachute jumps, rock climbing, fist fights and shootouts. Then there’s the occasional smooch on the lips by strikingly beautiful women (Rebecca Ferguson as an MI6 assassin, and a former wife played by Michelle Monaghan) and femme fatales (Vanessa Kirby as the arms dealer White Widow). McQuarrie’s action scenes rival the best ever created, choreographed and rendered in any action film including the entire James Bond series. Yes, he has Cruise as a formidable muse, but someone has to think up this crazy stuff: A three-way fight in a white-marble toilet stall; less green-screen magic and more real stunts; setting trap after trap and letting the IMF  execute daring escapes. Once the film ends, the storyline, intriguing as it is, will not be what you remember. Instead you will never forget the innovative stunts that are strung together with uncanny precision (editor Eddie Hamilton, MI – Rogue Nation, Kingsman: The Secret Service), intensified by a blaring emotionally-charged bass/violin-driven musical sound track (composer Lorne Balfe, Pacific Rim: Uprising) and enhanced by picture-perfect photography (cinematographer Rob Hardy, Ex Machina) that prefers attention-grabbing, you-are-there closeup shots. It’s refreshing to see Angela Bassett in a role that is equal to her ferocious power. It’s surprising to watch Cavill, who is so innocent in the Superman series, play against type and behave like a real dick. Juggling their comic lines with real states of fear and courage makes Pegg and Rhames the quintessential sidekicks. The entire supporting cast, including Sean Harris (Prometheus) as a diabolical mass murderer who is out to kill everyone Hunt loves, defers to Cruise and a character he has made indelible.Whatever he was paid to resurrect Ethan Hunt for the 6th MI was not enough. He’s the series lifeblood. Even at age 56, he can dodge a bullet with the best of ‘em.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018","In terms of pure action cinema, Fallout absolutely sings.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," It wasn’t until the ‘90s that the studios learned how to cut a decent trailer. Here, look at the trailer for “The Princess Bride.” That is one of my all-time favorite movies, rendered unwatchable by a shit trailer. By the end of the ‘90s, the trailer editing had gotten so good that they were able to make “Wild Wild West” look amazing. No, really. They did run in to one teensy problem, though. As the CGI improved, more and more money shots wound up going into the trailer. By the time a film hit theaters, moviegoers who were enticed by the killer trailer felt duped, because the full-length film had nothing more to offer. The trailer became the film, and the film became a bloated, Criterion Edition director’s cut of the film. Thankfully, this problem has been corrected over time. Marvel, for one, has gotten ridiculously good at filling their trailers with wow moments while saving plenty more for those who pay to see the film. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is a bit of a throwback to those ‘90s days in that the first official trailer gave away so many of the film’s best moments that they included scenes that didn’t make the final cut. As hard as it is to believe, there is arguably more action in the trailer than there is in the film it’s meant to promote. That’s an exaggeration, but you get the point; Paramount overplayed what it has here, which is a shame, because it’s one of the better “M:I” films to date. Why they felt the need to go full frontal in the trailer is anyone’s guess. Goodness knows, they didn’t need to. IMF Agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) receives a new mission, two years after the events of “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation.” A group of former Syndicate agents have rebranded themselves the Apostles and are hell-bent on creating a new world order on the ashes of the existing world order. Ethan’s group is assigned to buy three plutonium cells that the Apostles intend to use in a massive strike, but the exchange is hijacked and Ethan, forced to choose between securing the plutonium and saving the life of longtime partner Luther (Ving Rhames), chooses Luther and loses the plutonium. The CIA is understandably unhappy about this and, given Ethan’s tendencies for doing the rogue thing, new CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) assigns August Walker (Henry Cavill) as a ride-along in Ethan’s attempts to reacquire the plutonium. The original plan involves assuming the identity of Apostles leader John Lark, a man whose identity is so secret that there isn’t a single intelligence agency in the world with a photo of him. Surely, nothing can go wrong here. Writer/director Christopher McQuarrie knows a thing or two about setting up a big reveal, but it’s a bit shocking to see how quickly he gives it all away here. My 11-year-old son picked up on a shot that lingered just a little too long. That’s right, Mr. “Usual Suspects” couldn’t even fool a tween this time around. That’s gotta hurt, but then again, he was the director as well; he could have shot it differently. He basically owned himself here. As Father Time tries in vain to catch up with Cruise (since, as we all know, no one can outrun Tom Cruise), the actor goes to extra lengths to prove that he still belongs in the action game. This is easily the most visceral “M:I” film to date, with the bathroom fight scene serving as the peak butt-kicking in a movie where Cruise more or less gets his ass handed to him for two and a half hours straight. When he isn’t fighting, Cruise is diving out of a cargo plane at 10,000 feet (a truly stunning sequence), flying a helicopter like he’s at a demolition derby, cycling the streets of Paris at top speed (and unless it’s CGI, it appears Cruise did most of his own riding), and, of course, running — for two straight minutes, at a full sprint, without losing a step. That last bit borders on self-parody but at the same time is pretty awesome. The final climax is, well, odd. It’s shot in such a manner that the audience gets a sense of what it feels like to be Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg, doing his finest work in the “M:I” ‘verse to date), wondering if Ethan will be able to complete the mission but not really knowing, and that feels like a frightening, exhausting place. At the same time, it carries the faint whiff of a reshoot (or at least a re-edit) considering the trailer footage that was clearly from the final scene didn’t make the final cut. A more satisfying ending was within their grasp with only a couple extra shots, which makes the decision to end the film this way a curious one. The “Mission: Impossible” series is one of the few to defy the rule of sequels and deliver the goods 22 years after its first installment debuted. “Fallout” suffers slightly by comparison to most of its predecessors, but to be fair, the previous three installments (“Mission: Impossible 3,” “Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol” and “Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation”) were the best of the bunch. “Fallout” is good, but it could have been the best of them all if it had done a better job of keeping its cover.

"Jul 26, 2018"," La meilleure décision cinéphilique que j'ai prise cet été est de faire un marathon Mission: Impossible en revoyant les cinq premiers épisodes (chacun desquels renferme de bons éléments, certains plus que d'autres) avant la sortie du nouveau film, qui s'avère être de loin le meilleur de la série, car ce dernier ne tire pas sa supériorité d'une distanciation de ce qui est venu précédemment, mais bien d'une construction qui offre une synthèse et un perfectionnement de tout ce qui a distingué la franchise jusqu'à maintenant. Le scénariste et réalisateur Christopher McQuarrie, qui était déjà à la barre de Rogue Nation, semble lui-même avoir revu tous les films afin d'apprendre des réussites et des erreurs survenues ici et là, d'une part, mais aussi de distiller l'essence du personnage d’Ethan Hunt et de lui faire vivre son ultime aventure. Les premiers échos en ligne mentionnaient notamment que Mission: Impossible: Fallout était comparable à The Dark Knight, et c'est très juste. Voici un récit épique aux enjeux très personnels, avec des méchants qui recherchent l'anarchie et le chaos, et des héros qui doivent redoubler d'ardeur pour arriver à leurs fins sans corrompre leurs principes. J'avais envie de dire qu'on retrouve un sens du suspense et du rebondissement digne de Nolan, mais en tant que scénariste oscarisé de The Usual Suspects, McQuarrie est en fait un précurseur de ce type de thriller complexe et ingénieux. Qui plus est, il est devenu au fil des années un des meilleurs réalisateurs d'action de Hollywood, et son plus récent long métrage n’est rien de moins qu'un chef-d’œuvre du genre. Du début à la fin, Mission: Impossible - Fallout est rempli de séquences aussi inventives que brillamment mises en scène, un feu roulant de gags et de cascades incroyables qui excite, surprend et divertit comme bien peu de films y parviennent. Dès le premier acte, on a droit à des scènes d'action géniales (le saut en parachute, la bagarre aux toilettes) qui seraient les moments forts d'un autre film, mais qui ne sont ici que des amuse-bouches. On est par la suite dans une intense succession de poursuites à moto, en voiture, à pied (c'est toujours bien avisé de faire courir Tom Cruise!) et même, lors du jouissif climax, à une poursuite d'hélicoptères! À travers le tout, McQuarrie s'amuse avec tous les clichés de Mission: Impossible

 : les masques, les trahisons, les figures d'autorité qui abandonnent constamment Ethan, les décomptes mortels… Heureusement, Hunt peut compter sur ses deux plus fidèles acolytes, Luther (Ving Rhames, qui est là depuis le premier épisode) et Benji (Simon Pegg, qui est arrivé dans le III lorsque J.J. Abrams est devenu producteur de la franchise), en plus de renouer avec le meilleur personnage féminin de la série, Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), introduite par McQuarrie dans Rogue Nation. Enfin, l’équipe est ici complétée par le nouveau venu Walker, incarné par le mythique Henry Cavill moustachu! Si vous aimez le moindrement les sensations fortes au grand écran, courez voir 
Mission: Impossible - Fallout dès que possible. Je ne peux pas imaginer qu’on voit une meilleure mégaproduction cette année.  Votre mission, si vous l'acceptez, est d’aller voir l’excellent Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation de Christopher McQuarrie, à égalité ou presque avec Ghost Protocol comme le meilleur film de la série. Bien entouré par Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner et Ving Rhames, l’éternellement jeune et fringant Tom Cruise se lance avec intensité dans une succession de cascades, de poursuites, de bagarres et de fusillades, en plus bien sûr d’une des emblématiques scènes d’infiltration de la série. Confession : n’ayant jamais été un admirateur de Chevy Chase, je n’ai même pas vu National Lampoon’s Vacation… Mais je trouve que cette suite mettant en vedette Ed Helms a l’air plutôt drôle. Pas assez pour courir le voir en salle, mais sûrement pour lui donner une chance sur Netflix, malgré les critiques négatives. Je suis curieux d’aller voir Tangerine, qui sort discrètement en salle à Montréal après avoir été présenté à Fantasia. Cette comédie de Sean Baker mettant en vedette une prostituée transsexuelle a été bien reçue à Sundance, mais ceci peut mener à une déception (Me and Earl and the Dying Girl) comme à une formidable surprise (Dope). Aussi en salle cette semaine : Bikes vs Cars de Fredrik Gertten, Cartel Land de Matthew Heineman, La Prochaine fois je viserai le coeur de Cédric Anger. Voici les premières images du cinquième film de la série de films d’action mettant en vedette Tom Cruise dans le rôle du super agent Ethan Hunt. J’avais déjà très hâte de voir le film, mais là, je suis encore plus coinvaincu! Désolé pour le blabla d’Entertainment Tonight, mais pour l’instant, ça semble être le seul endroit où les premières images de Jack Reacher: Never Go Back sont disponibles. Il s’agit bien sûr de la suite du film très badass de Tom Cruise adapté des romans de Lee Child. Christopher McQuarrie est ici remplacé par Edward Zwick à la réalisation, et Cobie Smulders partage la vedette avec cruise. Mission: Impossible est une série de films assez unique dans le paysage hollywoodien. Jusqu’à maintenant, chaque film avait amené un nouveau réalisateur et une approche distinctive.  Inspiré de la télésérie culte (1966-1973), le premier long métrage, signé Brian De Palma, était un film d’espionnage relativement classique, avec quelques scènes où le suspense était à son paroxysme.  Réalisé par John Woo, Mission: Impossible II est un quasi remake de Notorious de Hitchcock où le réalisateur hongkongais fait dans l’excès de style, se parodiant presque lui-même (j’ai quand même plutôt aimé). Le 3e film par J.J. Abrams prend pratiquement la forme d’un long épisode d’Alias, une de mes téléséries préférées à l’époque. M:I-3 demeure néanmoins le chapitre que j’aime le moins de la franchise.  

Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol de Brad Bird a élevé la série à un tout autre niveau, avec des cascades absiolument spectaculaires et beaucoup d’humour. Qu’en serait-il du 5e Mission: Impossible, écrit et mis en scène par Christopher McQuarrie, le scénariste oscarisé de The Usual Suspects, qui a aussi réalisé le film culte The Way of the Gun en plus de diriger Tom Cruise dans l’étonnant Jack Reacher? J’avais bien hâte de le découvrir lorsque j’ai virtuellement assisté à la première canadienne de Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation ce lundi soir; la première avait lieu à Toronto en présence de Cruise et McQuarrie, mais le film et le Q&A avec le réalisateur et l’acteur étaient aussi présentés dans une douzaine d’autres cinémas Cineplex à travers le pays, dont au Banque Scotia Montréal.  Comme tous les Mission: Impossible, Rogue Nation déploie une intrigue alambiqué à grands coups d’exposition. Mais comme dans Ghost Protocol, le tout est allégé par une foule de gags hilarants et la chimie opère entre les personnages, particulièrement entre Ethan et Benji. Et que dire des scènes d’action! Outre celle de l’avion, on a droit à des bagarres brutales (incluant quelques combats au couteau) et à des fusillades excitantes; à une captivante séquence où nos héros tentent d’empêcher un attentat lors d’une représentation de Turandot à l’Opéra de Vienne; 

à une autre des scènes d'infiltration qui ont fait la réputation de la série, cette fois-ci jusqu’à un serveur informatique sous-marin; 

à une incroyable poursuite à Casablanca où Hunt conduit une BMW, puis prend place sur une moto; et ainsi de suite. Sans être aussi stylisée que celle de Brian De Palma ou de John Woo, la réalisation de Christopher McQuarrie est néanmoins parfaitement efficace, comparable au travail de Brad Bird sur le film précédent. De fait, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation est à mon avis plus ou moins à égalité avec Ghost Protocol en tant que meilleur film de la série. Pas mal pour un cinquième épisode!  Mettant en vedette Ben Affleck en Batman, Henry Cavill en Superman et Gal Gadot en Wonder Woman, le film de Zack Snyder prendra l’affiche le 25 mars 2016. Mais dans un Hollywood où les véritables stars de cinéma semblent en voie de disparition, il représente un vestige d’une autre époque, un acteur foncièrement “populaire” (même si ses films ont moins de succès aujourd’hui que par le passé), avec une énergie et une personnalité uniques… Un Monsieur Charisme qui a néanmoins souvent laissé des cinéastes déconstruire quelque peu son image trop parfaite. Et comme je le mentionne dans ma critique de Rogue Nation, chaque épisode de la série Mission: Impossible est signé par un talentueux réalisateur différent, qu’on suppose que Cruise, qui produit ces films, a choisi personnellement : Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird, Christopher McQuarrie. On dira ce qu’on voudra, il y a relativement peu d’acteurs hollywoodiens
contemporains qui ont autant de charisme que Thomas Cruise Mapother IV. On
achète un billet pour un film comme American
Made avant tout pour le plaisir de voir une vraie bonne performance de « movie
star », livrée par le seul et unique Tom
Cruise. Ce dernier incarne
Barry Seal, un pilote commercial qui, en 1978, est recruté par la CIA pour
aller prendre des photos aériennes en Amérique Centrale. Au fil d’évènements
souvent abracadabrants, il se retrouve à interagir avec le Général Noriega à
Panama, le cartel de Medellín en Colombie, et les Contras au Nicaragua. Et ce n’est
que le commencement! Racontant de façon dynamique et inventive un récit incroyable, mais
apparemment vrai à propos d’un fascinant antihéros, American
Made est manifestement influencé par les épopées criminelles de
Scorsese (Goodfellas, Casino, The Wolf of Wall
Street). Sans être aussi maîtrisé, le film de Doug
Liman — qui retrouve Cruise après le génial Edge
of Tomorrow — captive et divertit constamment, grâce à une caméra nerveuse qui
cadre souvent les personnages de très près et à un montage serré qui nous
mitraille d’information visuelle. Mention spéciale aux nombreuses scènes d’avion,
toutes très intenses. Reste que, répétons-le, les meilleurs effets spéciaux du film sont le
sourire, le regard et le langage corporel de Tom Cruise, qui décuple l’urgence
de chaque séquence, s’y investissant toujours entièrement. Sarah
Wright, Domhnall Gleeson, Caleb Landry Jones et d’autres se
démarquent à l’écran, mais il n’y a aucun doute qu’American
Made repose sur les épaules de Cruise, en grande forme. Juste à temps pour le Comic-Con, voici la une d’Entertainment Weekly avec Ben Affleck en Batman, Gal Gadot en Wonder Woman et Henry Cavill en Superman, tels qu’ils apparaîtront dans Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice. Ce remake plus ou moins fidèle du film culte de 1989 recycle certains éléments du scénario original dans un contexte assez différent. Mais les grandes lignes sont là : Dalton, un type ayant la réputation de savoir se servir de ses poings, est recruté pour venir faire le ménage dans un bar routier envahi par la racaille; il développe une relation avec une infirmière du coin; un malveillant homme riche contrôle presque tout dans les environs.Le Road House de 2024 diffère notamment de son inspiration par le fait que Elwood Dalton (plutôt que James Dalton) est un ancien combattant de UFC déchu, qui mène une existence de vagabond vivant dans sa voiture lorsqu’on le rencontre, et que le bar routier qui l’engage se trouve dans les Keys de Floride plutôt qu’au Missouri. Là où le bât blesse, c’est que notre protagoniste est incarné par un Jake Gyllenhaal correct, mais loin d’être aussi iconique et badass que Patrick Swayze. De même, le méchant joué par Billy Magnussen n’arrive pas à la cheville du parfaitement détestable Ben Gazzara. Et les créateurs de cette nouvelle version n’ont même pas tenté de remplacer le vieux pote interprété par Sam Elliott! Mentionnons également qu’au lieu du Jeff Healey Band, on doit se contenter d’une succession de groupes anonymes jouant au bar alors que les bouteilles de bière volent de toute part. Bref, il s’agit indéniablement d’une pâle copie du long-métrage de Rowdy Herrington, qui n’est toutefois pas sans qualités. Malgré trop de longueurs, le remake inclut quand même plusieurs scènes d’action assez percutantes. Et à la mi-parcours, l’introduction du coloré psychopathe Knox, un rôle défendu avec enthousiasme par le véritable champion d’arts martiaux mixtes Conor McGregor, dynamise considérablement le récit. Il y a aussi une trame narrative intéressante impliquant une jeune fille (Hannah Love Lanier) travaillant dans une librairie qui compare la situation dans laquelle se retrouve Dalton à un roman western, ce qui n’est pas sans rappeler une certaine scène de Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. En janvier, le réalisateur Doug Liman a annoncé qu’il boycotterait la première de Road House (2024) à SXSW à cause de la décision d’Amazon MGM de lancer son film directement sur la plateforme Prime Video. Ironiquement, alors qu’il aurait été difficile de recommander d’aller le voir en salle, c’est le genre de vue qui mérite quand même qu’on lui jette un coup d’œil dans le confort de chez soi, sans trop d’attentes.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has made a costly mistake. Now he's being knowingly manipulated while having to choose whether to save those closest to him or side with the greater good in ""Mission Impossible - Fallout."" Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has made a costly mistake. Now he's being knowingly manipulated while having to choose whether to save those closest to him or side with the greater good in ""Mission Impossible - Fallout."" For his sixth outing of the franchise, star Cruise has brought back ""Rogue Nation's"" writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, the first filmmaker to return to the series, and ""Fallout"" suggests he made have finalized a filmmaking partner. ""Mission Impossible - Fallout,"" while not perfect, is hands down the best of the six films, a continually twisting exercise in double and triple crossing, non-stop action, insane stunts and, most importantly, emotional resonance. Never before have we cared about these characters as much as we do here, the return of Hunt's wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), last seen briefly in ""Ghost Protocol,"" giving the climax additional weight.
The film begins with a few wobbles. After learning that his capture of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has resulted in a global group of Apostles rising up to continue his plans, Hunt's IMF team, now led by former CIA Director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) must retrieve plutonium in their possession. With the suitcase in his possession, Hunt's attention is diverted by Luther (Ving Rhames) held at gunpoint and it is lost, even with Benji (Simon Pegg) backing him up. The mistake plays like amateur hour for the highly trained agent. They learn the plans for the next transfer by fooling nuclear expert Nils Debruuk (Kristoffer Joner, ""The Wave"") with a gambit that's readily apparent to anyone who's seen one of these films before, then head to Paris where a man named Lark (Liang Yang) is to meet with the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) under cover of her charity event.
But there is a catch. New Director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) insists that the mission include one of her own, CIA Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), and he proves a serious thorn in Hunt's side when he loses consciousness after jumping out of a plane at 25,000 feet into a lightning storm, the first of Cruise's increasingly mind blowing stunts. Things get worse when Lark is tipped off to their presence, the two men saved by the surprise appearance of MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). With Lark dead, Hunt must now hope the Widow is unaware of his appearance and play the part. But the Widow, who is obviously attracted to Hunt, doesn't have the plutonium. What she has is a deal to receive it by delivering Lane in a plot that includes murdering French authorities transporting him.
McQuarrie has devised ingenious ways for Hunt to thwart impossible situations, but again, a mysterious motorcycle riding assassin trying to kill Lane is obviously who we think it is. Once over that hurdle, though, ""Fallout"" really takes off, Cruise driving helmetless against Parisian traffic on a motorcycle, driving cars over stairs, climbing a rope dangling from a helicopter, ramming a helicopter in midair and scaling cliff faces (ironically it was a London rooftop jump that shattered the star's ankle in a scene that was used in the film). The film's climax even makes the old 'cut the red wire' bomb defusing cliche fresh, intercutting among three locations (one of which includes Julia). McQuarrie and his actors shred our nerves, piling on more and more obstacles as the minutes count down.
Cruise's stunts here are jaw dropping, but it is the relationships among the characters that really make this one so powerful. Hunt is faced with putting every member of his team and the two women in his life in serious danger. Hunt's reunion with Julia in Kashmir, where she is working to control a smallpox outbreak with her husband Patrick (Wes Bentley), is stunning, Cruise and Monaghan expressing a myriad of emotions nonverbally. Ilsa's presence is beautifully handled, Ferguson acknowledging the depth of Hunt's prior relationship in what amounts to a romantic succession. The complexity of all of these crossed wires almost makes the film's villain redundant, Harris incapacitated for most of the movie's running time, but while he's still alive at ""Fallout's"" conclusion, it is the White Widow I suspect we may see more of, Kirby applying a delicious amorality spiked with sauce.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Before internet cat videos, before flip phones, before Beyoncé could talk–let alone sing–there was Tom Cruise. A nuclear blast might kill him, but don’t be so sure. He’s as enduring as the pyramids, if not nearly as impressive. Yet even people who don’t care for Cruise often have a weakness for the Mission: Impossible movies, and that’s as it should be. Their outlandish plots and over-the-cliff stunts are the most suitable delivery systems for his energy and undimmable wattage: he just makes sense in them. Mission: Impossible—Fallout may be the best Mission: Impossible movie since the first, made in the dawn of the cat-Internet age, 1996, by Brian De Palma. Or perhaps it’s just the one with the mostest: even by the franchise’s extravagant standards, Fallout throws off Hope-diamond levels of grandeur. If your recollection of the last entry in the series, the 2015 Rogue Nation, self-destructed five seconds after viewing, don’t worry. All you need to know about this one is that Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and friends–played once again by the eminently appealing Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg, both of whom make Cruise seem more human just by proximity–need to foil the plot of MI6 operative turned anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who hopes to mend the world by sowing chaos. Now there’s some logic for you. The plot involves the usual rubber face masks, as well as plenty of double- and triple-crossing and the stealing of plutonium. Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust, introduced in Rogue Nation, returns: she was a foxy-smart presence in that movie, as she is here. One of Fallout‘s standouts is a fabulously choreographed fight sequence in a mirrored, all-white Parisian men’s room involving, among others, Hunt and a CIA tagalong played by the almost obnoxiously elegant Henry Cavill. Their grunts, their high kicks, their showy, arm-swinging punches become design elements. The results are horrible and beautiful at once. They also represent the great care writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and editor Eddie Hamilton have taken with every action scene here: they’re all constructed with brain-surgery precision, not just fed through the usual fast-cutting wood chipper. That means you can follow the movement of a car, a motorcycle, a helicopter or a human body for long, languorous stretches, which should be the point of an action scene, after all. It’s typical for Cruise to run a lot in the Mission: Impossible pictures, and this one doesn’t disappoint. He runs–and runs and runs and runs. No one else runs like this. Cruise is an unhinged stickman, outrunning the devil, the aging process, time itself. He will outrun us all. The most impossible mission is the one that ticks inside him.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," I just don’t get it. How can almost every element in a movie be something we’ve seen before — over and over, since practically the dawn of the movies — and still convince audiences they’re experiencing it for the first time? The rubber masks. The frenzied global datelines. Mad motorized scrambles through the capitals of Europe, the lack of knocked-over fruit carts the only visible sign we’re not watching this in 1946 or 1972. And of course a bomb or two that needs defusing, a countdown clock, and a red wire — or is it a green wire? — that needs cutting at just the right last second. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” has bits so old you practically have to scrape the moss off them, but that’s what writer-director Christopher McQuarrie has done. The sixth installment in the now-venerable movie series — it began way back in 1996, lifting off from the beloved 1960s TV show — is not just one of the best but, at
 its best, an exercise in pure action-movie propulsion and an essay in how to get from Point A to Point B in the most ingenious and exhausting way imaginable. One of the series’ better jokes by now is that secret agent Ethan Hunt is finally showing some wear and tear, as is the man who plays him. Tom Cruise has been cast as Teflon Tom for so long that it’s cheering to see him get the worst of it in a fist fight or end a chase scene looking as though he has to vomit. “Fallout” saddles Hunt with a tagalong in the form of August Walker (Henry Cavill), a strutting (and, honestly, pretty dull) CIA operative for whom every interaction with his rival is a game of “Quien es mas macho?” In the movie’s various shoot-outs and dust-ups, Walker proves better than Hunt at the short game, and the question becomes whether our hero can even last to see the long game. Of course he can. You know how these movies work, and larger narrative surprise is not their concern. Instead, McQuarrie understands that a “Mission Impossible” movie is made of pearls on a string — that their disposable pleasure lies in putting in Hunt and his fellow agents in a box with no exits and then watching them get out. Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the mad genius from “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation” (2015), is in custody, but his evil minions, the Apostles, are still out there wanting to bring down Western Civ, and they’re abetted by an anonymous mastermind code-named John Lark, who’s angling for three stolen croquet balls of plutonium so he can fulfill Lane’s dark vision of nuclear disaster on the cheap. Too much plot? I entirely agree, and so, I think, does McQuarrie. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” will give us a bit of dialogue to orient the movie in the next required direction and then uncork an action sequence that relies equally on fluid camerawork (Rob Hardy), smart editing (Eddie Hamilton), scrupulous stunt choreography (Wade Eastwood), the judicious application of digital effects, game actors and stunt players, and a guiding directorial intelligence that allows audiences to hold the larger picture in its head while quietly goggling at the individual moments of mayhem and giggling at thematic variations. The sequence in a gleaming white men’s room, seemingly designed as a fight club, in which Hunt, Walker, and an extremely capable subsidiary villain (Liang Yang) try to dispatch each other using only a detached P-trap from a bathroom sink. The long, multi-leveled chase scene that unfolds across Paris as Hunt and company pretend to want to free Lane from an armored vehicle while simultaneously enacting a complicated 3-D high-speed chess game that involves cars, trucks, motorcycles, and other lovingly deployed vehicles going the wrong way around the Arc de Triomphe. A desperate yet quite funny dash across the rooftops of London — and through the upper stories of office buildings — during which Cruise apparently fractured an ankle and you can practically hear the snap. A climax that takes place amid the high snowy wastes of Kashmir (as played by New Zealand) that includes a delicate pas de deux of mangled helicopters, some hand-to-chair combat, a near-hanging, a few surprise appearances, an actual emotional payoff or two, and a cliffhanger so preposterous and so literal that you either willingly hand the filmmakers your disbelief or swear off action movies forever. I know which side I’m on. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” manages to make an antiquated property and an aging star look up-to-date by insisting on the adrenaline of the Right Now. It don’t mean a thing, but it sure has that zing.",POSITIVE

"Jul 26, 2018"," Tom Cruise has a death wish. That’s already been established multiple times over both inside the Mission: Impossible franchise and outside of it. Clearly, the actor’s most memorable action hero, IMF agent Ethan Hunt also has one, and not just because it’s evident that he will go to any lengths to save anyone he considers a friend. The opening sequence of Mission: Impossible – Fallout sees Ethan Hunt and his team (Simon Pegg’s comedic relief presence Benji, Ving Rhames’ relaxed communications man Luther, and although not present for this scene, the first-ever returning female in the series, Rebecca Ferguson as British intelligence agent Ilsa Faust who is once again forced into playing different sides of the equation, all led by Alec Baldwin’s Hunley) undercover brokering a deal to acquire some plutonium in order to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. Things go south, and for once the mission actually does become impossible; Ethan is forced to choose between going after the weapons or saving a friend. In other words, it’s a choice between saving one life or potentially millions considering the proposed nuclear weapons have the threatening capabilities to cause a great deal of suffering on one-third of the planet. Weighing the consequences of either decision as best as someone possibly can within a three-second countdown, Ethan opts for the route grounded in morality and loyalty. His death wish is putting his own life into further danger (along with the rest of the world) for the safety of his closest allies, and it’s a dynamic that consistently pops up during every shady situation, especially as the operative unintentionally assumes the identity of a key weapons buyer and gradually mixes himself into the underbelly of the black market. Not to make this too much about politics, but given current events, it’s actually a pleasant message to have in a nonstop action spectacle; every life matters and empathy is the greatest human trait of all. Whereas most espionage films tend to use doublecrosses and betrayals as a cliché, every character’s decision here usually feels grounded in real emotions; agents often find themselves on the same side but with opposite objectives, injecting much unpredictability as to how certain events will play out. There’s genuine care for one another in a crisis where the outcome has drastically different pros and cons for varying protagonists. On top of that, there are multiple wonderful small twists that will assuredly always catch viewers off guard; two, in particular, are downright clever and also yield laughter. Although, one more important swerve is fairly predictable and probably should have been revealed a little sooner. Speaking of the writing, the script and overall direction from Christopher McQuarrie (he also helmed the previous installment Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation marking himself the first director to return for seconds) is masterful in its ability to tell a winding story about spies and terrorists with different motives while also presenting things with clarity. Far too often in similar experiences one forgets who works for who and just what certain figures are actually trying to accomplish, mostly because they come across as plot devices rather than personalities. Both of McQuarrie’s installments don’t contain this shortcoming one bit; give the talented editing team just as much credit. It’s also not afraid to place major characters in life-threatening situations, going as far as killing one off (as long as the inevitable sequel sticks with the decision). Of course, Tom Cruise is granted ample opportunity to pull off death-defying stunts that range from HALO jumps to motorcycle chases to a helicopter chase that is an all-timer in terms of both thrilling action and crisp direction (the crash landing is followed sometimes from the inside of the cockpit, among other chaotic sights surrounded by snowy mountains and stunning Eastern European landscapes). To be fair, the entire film is an all-timer for the action genre. There is also lots and lots of running as to be expected (does Cruise ever run out of stamina? Good Lord, some of the sprinting tracking shots across towering city buildings are breathtaking). However, the difference maker again separating this and other franchises come from its insistence on utilizing practical effects as much as humanly possible and Tom Cruise’s own extreme, throwing caution to the wind, dedication to every set-piece. One of the first major highlights involves Ethan and his new partner August Walker (Henry Cavill) leaping out of a plane parachuting into Paris; in an uninterrupted take, we see Henry Cavill with his back turned in the background of the shot taking the plunge. We know it’s not really him but actually, some stunt performer that deserves acknowledgment and credit that is unfortunately rarely given. In the same shot, Tom Cruise runs toward the camera, face crashing into the screen letting us know that yes, this is him, performing the same jump. Admittedly, some of it is surrounded by a lightning storm and special effects, but that doesn’t change the fact that much of it is very real, and because of it, what ensues is one of the most intense segments I’ve ever seen in anything. And unlike this film’s predecessor which chose to explosively start with its biggest and best action sequence, Mission: Impossible – Fallout continuously gets more insane. Trust me, the trailer doesn’t show everything, and in some ways actually misdirects the audience with unused footage in place of far crazier moments. Very briefly, I should also state that not everything is about the 50+-year-old fountain of youth that is Tom Cruise. As previously mentioned, Henry Cavill is here and puts that downbeat seriousness of his Superman persona to good use as a focused government agent keen on aiding Ethan Hunt; he’s on a short leash after already messing up the mission once. Vanessa Kirby also plays a blonde bombshell black market dealer of sorts wanted dead by apparently many people and is not always dependent on her henchmen or brother to look out for her. They are both welcome additions and contribute to a few fantastic fight scenes boasted by clear cinematography; the bathroom encounter is just plain awesome, as is thwarting off hitmen at a ritzy Paris rave-like party. There are a few more new and returning characters, and while I just don’t have the time to get into everyone, it should be mentioned that they all fit tightly into the narrative. It’s a rarity when a film has plenty of characters but also doesn’t feel overstuffed; McQuarrie splits up the screen time fairly and knows how to give everyone a memorable moment or line without causing a distraction or feeling superfluous. Truthfully, there is nothing that sticks out worth faulting Mission: Impossible – Fallout over. Sure, it falls into a few tropes with preventing bombs going off by cutting the right wires and continues to play off nostalgia with the facemasks, but these are minor quibbles. I suppose John Lark is a pretty lame name for a villain, but now I’m really reaching at scraps. The plot isn’t some incredible masterpiece of layered themes, but it does surprisingly have more on its mind than concocting new ways to potentially murder Tom Cruise. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find a legitimate flaw with Mission: Impossible – Fallout and report back to me. One last note, see this movie on the bigger screen possible even if it means driving hours.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," Only about 30 rocket-paced minutes have whizzed by before Mission: Impossible­—Fallout first flirts with truly impossible odds. Ethan Hunt, the human missile of American intelligence that Tom Cruise has been popping back in to play for more than 20 years now, is masquerading as a mysterious terrorist, the perfectly named John Lark, to buy back some plutonium he’s lost to a cabal of doomsday extremists. The bad guys, alas, will accept only one form of payment: the sneering anarchist supervillain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who Hunt put away in the last Mission: Impossible and is now forced to bust out of police custody to avert nuclear catastrophe. Forget, for a moment, the risk that our hero will unleash the world’s most dangerous man back on the world. How, exactly, can Hunt free his nemesis without either killing a lot of innocent cops or blowing his cover as an agent of chaos who wouldn’t think twice about leaving a trail of bodies in his wake? These kind of extreme dilemmas are all over the superior sixth entry in Hollywood’s most reliably entertaining ongoing franchise. Moving like the lit fuse that blazes brilliantly across the opening credits of both the original Mission: Impossible television series and its first big-screen adaptation, Fallout turns out to be a breathlessly exciting action spectacular: the blockbuster spy thriller as sustained endorphin rush. Escalation is the film’s nuclear energy source. It’s there, of course, in the downright lunatic stunts performed by Cruise, again defying good sense and his own advancing years to top his previous feats of reckless self-endangerment. But it’s also crucial to the perpetual motion machine of a story, to the way writer-director Christopher McQuarrie keeps raising the stakes, dropping new obstacles, bringing these weary espionage specialists ever closer to the event horizon implied by the title. The plots of Mission: Impossible movies tend to be convoluted but negligible, really only there to provide connective tissue between jaw-dropping set pieces. Fallout is no exception; tracking who has the weapons-grade MacGuffin when can feel like an exercise in futility. But part of the movie’s nonstop fun is the way McQuarrie taps back into the genre’s (and this series’) games of subterfuge, misdirection, and indeterminate loyalties, beginning with the fiendishly clever rug-pull of its worst-case-scenario prologue and epitomized by the goofily irresistible sight of characters dramatically ripping off lifelike rubber masks. (One is reminded that the writer-director made his name through the big-twist architecture of The Usual Suspects.) For a while, the biggest question mark of allegiance is August Walker (Henry Cavill, subverting his man-of-steel screen presence), the brutish CIA tagalong feeding his superiors the theory that Hunt may really be going rogue after years of being left out in the cold by his handlers. Using the amusingly unreliable support of IMF as a plot point counts as one of the script’s most self-aware choices. Up until now, Cruise has passed the reins of each new M:I installment to a different auteur, resulting in the rare mega-budget series to operate in a constant, thrilling state of stylistic reinvention. (Call it the polar opposite of the Marvel house style.) But any disappointment about the rehiring of McQuarrie, who previously assembled the stirring greatest-hits package Rogue Nation, goes up in smoke like a self-destructing message the minute his return engagement kicks into gear. Like Brad Bird’s playfully virtuosic Ghost Protocol, the high point of this franchise in more ways than one, Fallout creates an endless daisy chain of spectacle, so that one stunning display of acrobatic nerve is barely over before another begins. McQuarrie’s globetrotting action—the Nolanesque demolition-derby of an extraction scene; a foot chase that unfolds across rooftops and through buildings; an aggressive fist fight in a pristine-white restroom—is robustly physical, privileging vantages that make the nerve-racking practicality of its execution obvious. While Rogue Nation nodded to Casablanca, here McQuarrie pays tribute to the subterranean scramble of The Third Man, another European-set thriller of reversals and betrayals and cracked moral worldviews. Often, the filmmaker just seems to be attempting to put every 007 and Jason Bourne adventure to shame. He comes damn close. Of course, the constant of this series—and arguably its anchor of artistic personality—is Cruise’s horizontal and vertical plunge into the fray, his habit of playing chicken with the laws of gravity and the realities of aging. In Fallout, the star leaps headfirst out of an airplane, steers a motorcycle into the famously deadly oncoming traffic of the Arc De Triomphe roundabout, and eventually pilots an actual helicopter during the movie’s most elaborate high-altitude highlight. (The various on-set injuries are likely badges of honor for a showman so unconcerned with his own safety.) Converting all his vanity, mania, and pathological need to amaze into kinetic energy, Cruise makes Hunt not just a remarkable force of pure determination but also a kind of slapstick comic figure. What are sidekicks Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) really around for but to provide straight-man reactions to his willingness to leap through whatever flaming hoop the universe puts in front of him? Naturally, Fallout also plays to Cruise’s waning appeal as a romantic leading man, supplying him with no less than three potential love interests. It’s no accident that the biggest sparks fly with Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson), the MI6 double agent enthrallingly introduced in Rogue Nation. Their attraction is basically an extension of their sensation-junkie workaholism: When mission objectives are at odds, even romance becomes a high-wire risk. But who is Hunt, really? The best answer has always been a cipher in motion, the flesh-and-blood means to Mission: Impossible’s show-stopping ends. McQuarrie hands the secret-agent man the standard superhero anxiety about getting his friends and loved ones caught in the crossfire of his can’t-stop-won’t-stop exploits. But if Fallout has real dramatic stakes beyond minute-by-minute survival—its precarious balancing act on the edge of life and death—they come down to the looming threat of tough moral choices, the same kind of lives-trading compromises The Avengers couldn’t force themselves to make earlier this summer. One might wish that McQuarrie pushed that predicament further, that he really forced Hunt—playing bad to ensnare the really bad—to inch up to the edges of his ethical limits for the sake of the greater good. But Fallout’s almost inexhaustible supply of sticky situations provides suspense aplenty: This may be the closest this peerless series has ever come to making us believe that the mission may actually be impossible.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," 
Reliability. Of all the qualities one could ascribe to the Mission: Impossible movies, that one is
the most cogent. This has especially been true since writer/director
Christopher McQuarrie (who seems to be Tom Cruise’s personal screenwriter) took
over for the last two films. Combined together, Rogue Nation and Fallout
represent the best the series has had to offer, with the latter building on
plot threads introduced in the former. This latest movie, the sixth in the
series, offers everything its predecessors have done, except amped up to almost
Fast and Furious levels. It’s a
strong, engaging spy thriller with plenty of action and a convoluted storyline.
Like most refrigerator movies, the holes become apparent upon reflection but
the pacing is so relentless that they don’t interfere while in the theater.
Although perhaps a little too long and not as tightly plotted as Rogue Nation, Fallout offers everything a viewer could reasonably expect from a Mission: Impossible production. It’s
reliable. McQuarrie has brought a slightly more Bond-influenced flavor
to Mission: Impossible, giving Cruise
his own version of 007, albeit without the bevvy of gorgeous women. There are
however, oodles of gadgets, an “M” figure of sorts (played by Alec Baldwin),
and a Blofeld-inspired bad guy, the inscrutable and devious Solomon Lane (Sean
Harris). The series continues to retain certain elements of its TV forebear,
including the iconic theme music and the tape-recorded mission message. (“Your
mission, should you choose to accept it…”) 
Many familiar faces have returned as well. Despite hinting that he might
retire after the fourth movie, Cruise hasn’t yet bowed out, coming back for his
sixth outing as Ethan Hunt. Joining him once again are Simon Pegg as Benji Dunn
and Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa moves closer to
earning the label of a “genuine love interest.” To this end, Michelle Monaghan
makes a return as Julia to provide Ethan with closure where she’s concerned.
Newcomers include Angela Bassett as Erica Sloan, the CIA director (not entirely
unlike the role she played in Olympus Has Fallen and its sequel); Vanessa Kirby as “White Widow;” and Henry Cavill as
the chief antagonist, Sloan’s “fixer” August Walker. You’d never guess he
moonlights as Superman. (In the missing-in-action category, Jeremy Renner, who
played Brant in Rogue Nation and Brad
Bird’s Ghost Protocol, is never mentioned.) This movie’s Macguffin is a suitcase containing three globes
of plutonium that Ethan loses early in the proceedings when faced with the
decision to either save one of his friends or protect the nuclear material.
According to director Hunley (Baldwin), he chooses wisely. Sloan, however,
doesn’t agree and sends Walker on Ethan’s next mission to ensure that the job
gets done. The plutonium is wanted by The Apostles, who are the remnants of The
Syndicate, which was effectively dismantled at the end of Rogue Nation. Ethan finds a “broker” named White Widow who is
willing to obtain the plutonium for a price: captured Syndicate mastermind
Lane, who is currently in custody. Ethan has to arrange his escape without
killing too many people. Things get complicated, of course, because Ilsa has
been recruited by MI6 to kill Lane in order to regain her standing with
Britain’s spy agency. This brings her back into contact with Ethan and Lane. McQuarrie’s vision of the Mission: Impossible movies is that, in addition to the heavy Bond
influence, they should include over-the-top action sequences reminiscent of the
Fast/Furious films and cat-and-mouse
caper movie elements that provide surprise twists. Fallout does a good job of melding the heavy lifting of narrative
exposition with at least a half-dozen high-octane action scenes, one of which features
a lengthy rooftop chase and another that’s focused on a helicopter showdown.
There are also the obligatory shoot-outs, fist fights, and car chases. The
romance is understated, not even featuring a kiss, but there’s palpable
chemistry between Cruise and Ferguson.  One minor problem with the film is its nearly 2.5-hour
length. For a movie that delights in draining its audience, the epic length can
be exhausting. There a sense that certain scenes could have been shortened and
some things could have been tightened up a little. This is by far the longest
of the Mission: Impossible movies,
with the previous installments tracking between 120 and 132 minutes (except the first, which ran 110 minutes). Cut 15-20 minutes off the length of Fallout and it might have been the best
entry of the series. As it is, it’s not far off the mark.  Like Bond, Mission:
Impossible proves that this kind of adrenaline-fueled spy thriller isn’t
dead – it just needs a strong leading man and an accomplished director to bring
it to the screen with the power and profile necessary to gain audience
investment. Whether Fallout will
bring the series to new box office heights remains to be seen but it delivers
as expected and there’s no reason why there shouldn’t be more installments.
Cruise isn’t yet too old to credibly play Ethan (although he may want to cut
back on doing his own stunts) and there are additional stories to tell. Having
weathered the choppy waters of its early sequels, Mission: Impossible has hit a groove and if the fallout from this latest
movie is another one, I don’t think many people will complain.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," “My name is Christopher McQuarrie. I am the writer, director, and co-producer of ‘Mission: Impossible - Fallout.’ The biggest challenge of this sequence is constantly maintaining a connection with Tom Cruise, knowing that Tom Cruise is going to jump out of a plane at 25,000 feet, and that the camera is going to stay with him. When Tom and I discussed this idea, right away the challenge became making it the most subjective sequence we possibly could, putting the audience with the character of Ethan Hunt. And that means that everything that Tom does, as he’s jumping out of his plane, the camera operator has to do with him in reverse. So of course, this shot right here, once this starts, we were determined to have no cuts from this moment until Tom reaches the ground. Just prior to this clip starting, he’d had a conflict with Henry Cavill, and Henry Cavill has disconnected his air hose as a way of getting Ethan Hunt out of his way, so he can jump out of the plane. So Craig O’Brien, our camera operator, is jumping backwards out of the plane, and Tom has to come towards him and come within three feet of the camera to remain in focus. Which means Tom has to stop himself, and he has a three inch margin of error because of the light at that time of day. It’s very difficult to maintain focus, and we had exactly three minutes of light everyday to gather these shots, and if you didn’t get the shot, it meant you came back the next day.” “What’s the matter, Hunt, afraid of a little lightning?” “The decision here to have all of the sound drop out was a practical decision to maintain that subjective reality, put you in Tom’s experience, and Tom is now coordinating all of his movements with Craig O’Brien. They’re actually doing a dance, so that we can maintain all of the storytelling without ever cutting, and so you’ll notice that the other actor is falling in the background there. His movements had to be coordinated with Tom, and then of course, the real danger in the sequence was a mid-air impact in which everyone could have collided — Tom, the camera operator, and the actor.” “Walker!” There’s a whole lot of everything in the “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” an entertainment machine par excellence that skitters around the world and has something to do with nuclear bombs, mysterious threats and dangerous beauties. Mostly, it has to do with that hyper-human Tom Cruise, who runs, drives, dives, shoots, flies, falls and repeatedly teeters on the edge of disaster, clinging to one after another cliffhanger. As usual, he works hard for our dollars and eyeballs in a movie that spins the oldies (a blonde with a knife in her garter) while pushing to greater spectacle-cinema extremes. Once again, Mr. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, who leads a crypto government unit called Impossible Missions Force that is as preposterous, politically dubious and near-magical as it was in the mid-1960s when the TV show first hit, latex masks and all. More than a half-century later, this impossible team’s leader is still receiving operational details via a self-destructing recording (should he choose to accept) and leaping unto the breach with his second bananas. Their numbers have shrunk over time, so now it’s a lonely guys’ club that includes the gruff Luther (Ving Rhames), who’s some kind of tech guy, and the rabbity Benji (Simon Pegg), another tech guy with more, faster patter. This is the sixth installment in this long-running series, and while I’ve seen all the movies at least once, the only entry that left a lasting visual imprint on me is the 1996 kickoff directed by Brian De Palma. That one of course features the series-defining image of Mr. Cruise suspended just inches above the floor. Since then, directors have come and gone, but only the latest, Christopher McQuarrie, has returned for repeat duty. Mr. Cruise’s affable, relaxed performance here suggests why. Mr. McQuarrie understands that the looser his star, often the looser (and better) the performance. “Fallout” has plenty of serious interludes, but its overall tone is borderline breezy, with bullets. The movie is propelled by action scenes that transmit a little something about the characters while nudging the story forward, much like the song-and-dance numbers in a musical. Fairly early, Ethan meets a slinky entrepreneur-operative called the White Widow (the charismatic Vanessa Kirby, who played Princess Margaret in the Netflix series “The Crown”). She’s the one with the shiv in her garter. Before she slides it out, Ethan and an unwelcome new partner, Walker (a fine Henry Cavill), ambush a villain (Liang Yang) in a men’s bathroom. The setting and Mr. Cavill’s pornstache and strapping masculinity invest the scene with titillating possibility: Is this an operation or a hookup? Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Jul 26, 2018"," Tom Cruise is our most earnest movie star – it's almost conceivable that he fractured his ankle on the set of Mission: Impossible – Fallout because somebody said, ""Hey, Tom, break a leg."" Well, it was for a good cause — he makes the movie fun to watch with his age-defying eagerness and death-defying stunts that bring a reasonably human scale back to blockbuster action, benumbed of late by the low-stakes digital fakery of special-effects movies. Cruise knows a good franchise when he's in one, and he's in one. This is his sixth Mission: Impossible caper,  his second with Christopher McQuarrie, also the scripter for The Usual Suspects, and a guy who likes to pull the rug out from under his audience. Fallout is two-and-a-half hours, that's a lot of rugs. His plot doubles down on double-crosses, and of course there is the reliable Million: Impossible gimmick of the synthetic face impersonations, so we're never really sure who we're looking at. All part of the fun in Fallout, which finds Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his colleagues (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) trying to locate weapons-grade plutonium before it can fall into the hands of freelance terrorist weirdos with an apocalyptic agenda. Complications arise, and a mistrustful CIA (embodied by Angela Bassett) forces Ethan to work with a brawny government thug named Walker (Henry Cavill), who tags along to monitor the mission and keep an eye on Ethan. It's a fun change of pace for Superman Cavill, who wears a 1970s Greg Morris tribute mustache, and looms like Victor McLaglen in a John Ford movie. When Hunt and Walker confront a martial arts whiz in a Paris bathroom (one of several first-rate action bits), Walker actually puts up his dukes. One is the White Widow (Elizabeth Kirby, vamping enthusiastically between episodes of The Crown), who's called the White Widow because McQuarrie likes alliteration. She's a broker in the plutonium deal, which turns out to be tied to the fate of Ethan's old nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), wearing a Hannibal Lecter straight jacket and taunting Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. The dream-sequence prologue reminds us that she was Ethan's wife (Michelle Monaghan), last seen in Ghost Protocol being given a new identity and separated from Ethan for her own protection. So, you see, it's because he loves her so much that he pretends she doesn't exist, and engages in ongoing flirtation with Rebecca Ferguson, returning as leather-clad super-agent Ilsa.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2018"," In the opening scene of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, Tom Cruise became the first actor to pull off a HALO (high altitude, low opening) jump, parachuting out the back of a C-17 military plane. That meant an extended free fall at over 7,600 metres, his five-foot-seven body flying through the air at 320 kilometres per hour with only an oxygen mask to protect him. Cruise and the production team trained for and strategized over how to perform the two-minute stunt for more than a year, with the action star jumping a total of 106 times to get the three takes he and director Christopher McQuarrie wanted, and for which there were only three minutes of available light to shoot per day, giving them a single daily opportunity to get the shot. But the high-flying stunt-work that the Mission: Impossible franchise — and Cruise, as Ethan Hunt — has become known for doesn’t end after the opening sequence. The HALO jump is followed by, in no particular order, grisly bathroom fisticuffs, a heart-pounding and relentless Paris motorcycle chase and a London rooftop jump (in which Cruise infamously broke his ankle leaping from one building to another, making for a rare Cruise injury but a winning take that made the cut). The film climaxes with its most epic yet (if you happen to believe anything can top Ghost Protocol’s Burj Khalifa climb or the original’s silent heist), featuring Cruise hanging off a helicopter above a mountain range in New Zealand (acting as Kashmir), which had the cast certain he was killed mid-stunt. It’s a long and visually sprawling sequence, with blink-or-you’ll-miss-it deathly swerves. For each unbelievable save throughout the film, there’s multiple precarious consequences that add up in just this one chain of events. Simply laying witness to it will have you burning calories in suspense. That should be incentive enough to see Fallout. The plot is secondary to the action – and that’s just fine. The storyline has the expected entanglements of double-crosses, close calls and mini twists as we follow Hunt and the IMF team join forces with the CIA to steal a set of plutonium cores that have fallen into the wrong hands: a terrorist group that goes by the name of The Apostles. The baddies intend to set off a nuclear attack in the Middle East. Needless to say, there’s a tight clock on the mission. It may all sound cliché, as action-movie plots often do, but it’s masterfully handled by McQuarrie, who is the first director to captain more than one M:I film (his last being Rogue Nation). He stays true to the ethos of the original, but raises the momentum. After all, M:I is an action franchise that has managed to reign supreme due to its classic structure, from its opening credits and iconic theme song to its seemingly miraculous ability to remain free of plot-holes.  At 147 minutes, Fallout is the longest film in the series, but it manages to feel like the swiftest ride. That’s no easy feat, but the high-octane action moves along quickly thanks to a cast that features the ever-charming Simon Pegg, Ving Rhames, Alec Baldwin and Angela Bassett. This instalment also marks the return of Rebecca Ferguson as the beguiling Ilsa Faust, who more than holds her own against a slightly more reckless Hunt. It also features The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby, Hunt’s saucy new foe, and Superman Henry Cavill as CIA assassin August Walker, who serves equal parts body and moustache, his sheer musculature an impressive action set-piece itself. Physically, he makes for a very worthy teammate for Hunt; fortunately, he’s spared much dialogue.  Nonetheless, the success or failure of the M:I movies always comes back to the 56-year-old Cruise. It’s a strange relationship audiences have to the actor and character in which both seem to merge together. Watching Hunt race against Paris traffic and circle a roundabout on a motorcycle without a helmet is exhilarating – partly, because it’s a great action sequence, but also because you know that’s the real Cruise under there, his cheeks gently puffing, his leg kicking out to steady himself. And while we know he will always make it out alive, there’s a degree of breathless disbelief that hangs in the air thanks to the wonderful confusion between actor and character instilled in us. At April’s CinemaCon, Pegg said, quite seriously, “It’s a daily stress going to work with Cruise. You don’t know if you’ll see him tomorrow.” Until the day comes that we won’t, which is, let’s face it, impossible, Tom Cruise reigns.

"Jul 25, 2018"," Let’s start with the good. A bedtime story for adrenaline junkies, a Jack-In-The-Box of predictable surprises, the latest Mission Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible - Fallout, rattles through its two-and-a-half hour running time like a runaway train. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s ensemble of action sequences, coupled together by bits of plot, is all momentum, putting star Tom Cruise, in an accelerating spiral of death-defying, if always escapable, predicaments. These include: Simon Pegg as jittery tech expert Benji, Ving Rhames as loyal computer hacker Luther, Ethan’s former wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and Ethan’s boss, Alec Baldwin. Returning from the fifth film, Mission: Impossible Rogue Nation, we have Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and the Rasputin-bearded bearded anarchist  Solomon Lane (Sean Harris).  Added to the mix are Angela Bassett as a CIA director of uncertain loyalties, Henry Cavill as a CIA mole, and Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in Netflix series, The Crown) as a slinky duplicitous arms-dealer/philanthropist known as White Widow.  Kirby is a lot of fun (a kind of Lady Gaga villainess) but the performances are mostly deliberated, delivered in shots of exposition-heavy dialogue or panicky shouts. There’s a plot that’s almost as baffling as the punctuation of the movie’s title. It has something to do with the acquisition of three blobs of plutonium by a cult of apocalypse-minded villains called The Apostles. But there are so many double-crosses, disguises and dream sequences, the story is a collapsing frame for the fight-and-chase set-pieces and timely stabs of the Lalo Schifrin musical theme.  Given all the on-screen risk-taking, Mission: Impossible - Fallout plays it pretty safe. What you get is essentially an action movies greatest hits package. The most impressive sequence is a fight, involving Chinese martial artist, Liang Yang, Cruise and Cavill, that sees the destruction of a bright white men’s washroom. It’s not especially original: Bathroom fights are such a staple of action movies that you can find “bathroom fights” scenes ranked on the internet.  Also familiar are the chase across rooftops, the escape from a woman assassin in a form-fitting suit, the battle in a helicopter cockpit, the late-opening parachute dive and the battle on a mountainous precipice. In the moment, the scenes are impressive but as the train of stunt sequences rolls on, the machine-tooled “escapism” feels increasingly predictable. Mission: Impossible plays at being risky while playing it safe. Each time Ethan Hunt (Cruise) drives, runs, speed-boats or helicopters around London, Paris or central Asia to save someone, tumble into a boat, or elude an enemy at precisely the right instant, you feel the fix is in. The character’s improvisational skills and improbable luck always prevail; the gears crunch and the cuckoo pops up from the clock at the right moment. In a comic-book hero age, Ethan Hunt is not supposed to  have super-powers, though his  achievements are consistently super-heroic.  What are his powers? They’re certainly not cerebral. Though Ethan can memorize massive amounts of instructions quickly, he rarely has a plan - to the humorous dismay of Simon Pegg’s ever-nervous Benji. Nor, is he a dandyish alpha-male showman like James Bond. Ethan/Tom, in this episode, is monastic. Though there are three women circling around him in the movie, romance must be held at arm’s length. There’s a long speech near the film’s end, by Ethan’s devoted sidekick, Luther, who explains that Ethan can’t have a successful relationship with a woman because he’s too committed to saving the world - which, frankly, sounds like a bit of an excuse. I don’t mean to confuse the actor with the role, though it’s clear the film’s creators (Cruise is also a producer) would like me to. Every Mission: Impossible advance story nowadays mentions Cruise’s dedication, his age-defying athleticism and enthusiasm (he just turned 56) and that he does his own stunt work. There’s a perverse highlight in the movie when he leaps between two Paris buildings and cracks his leg against a wall, pulls himself up and hobbles onward, because we know, in real life, Cruise broke his ankle on that stunt, putting the movie on hiatus and driving up the budget until he recovered.  Like the wrestler, Mick “Mankind” Foley, Ethan/Tom suffers for our pleasure.  Or, perhaps, since the audience is expected to go through vicarious agonies while he gets well-paid, we suffer for his pleasure. In either case, I wish the character were a little less sincere and self-sacrificing and a little more complex.  Also, for once, could the Mission: Impossible squad please defuse a bomb with more than a few seconds to spare? I’m beginning to suspect they’re dawdling on purpose. Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie.  Starring Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Michelle Monaghan and Alec Baldwin. Mission Impossible: Fallout shows at the Cineplex Varsity, Cineplex Yorkdale, Cineplex Yonge-Eglinton and Cineplex Yonge-Dundas.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," While continuing to make a steady stream of stand-alone movies—most of them pretty solid, if not outstanding—Tom Cruise has also been busy trying to build franchises, with less success.  The “Jack Reacher” series limped its way to a second installment, but both movies were mediocre at best.  And “The Mummy” was so atrocious that it seems single-handedly to have doomed Universal’s proposed Dark Universe project. By this time, however, CIA head Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) has grown tired of the IMF’s slapdash methods—and especially with Hunt’s reluctance to use methods that will involve the sacrifice of team members or widespread collateral damage in fulfilling its aims—and so saddles them with one of her own, ruthless agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), who has no such compunction. The White Widow’s opaque plans, however, require the now-quartet to liberate Lane from the permanent custody in which he’s being kept, passed from nation to nation for interrogation.  They succeed, but at that point the hitherto unidentified villain is unmasked (masks that allow characters to assume the identities of others remain, of course, a deliciously campy aspect of the M:I formula, and it comes into play here in a twisty turn of events).  Also entering the action at this juncture is MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who developed a romantic link with Hunt in “Nation,” and whose motives are here decidedly enigmatic. The big finale will take the crew from Europe to Asia, where they finally face off against both the freed Lane and the mysterious Lark—and deal with a digital meter clicking off the seconds to destruction. And yet the screenplay also takes the time to add links to previous movies in the series—not only Lane and Faust, but a last-act surprise that takes us back to the first trilogy, in a satisfying way.   (Just check the cast listing for clues.)  On a more basic level one can also appreciate McQuarrie’s recognition of a modicum of intelligence in viewers by not captioning the locales—“Paris, France,” “London, England”—as they change, as most multi-national action pictures do nowadays.  By simply dropping the places into conversation (as well as adding tongue-in-cheek, winking moments), it treats viewers as something other than drooling idiots. The result is the increasingly rare summer popcorn movie that actually makes it worthwhile to go to the concession stand and buy some.  Since it runs nearly two-and-a-half-hours, you’ll need the giant-sized tub, but you won’t have to run out for refills. That would be unfortunate, since the movie is tightly constructed, and you won’t want to miss anything. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," If America has a James Bond, it is Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), the persistently bouncy hero of the Mission: Impossible franchise, whose sixth entry, Fallout, hits theaters this week. Bond was framed as a paragon of British upper-class smoothness, a tuxedo-clad man’s man who felt most at home at a Monégasque casino, ordering martinis and killing bad guys with equal suaveness. Hunt is none of these things. He throws his whole body into every problem he encounters, crashing against walls and diving out of the sky with lunatic aplomb. His biggest strength is his brash confidence—his utter inability to conceive of failure even as it stares him in the face. As his boss Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) put it in 2015’s Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, Hunt is “the literal manifestation of destiny.” He’s a walking and talking copy of The Secret, who accomplishes tasks almost by magic, simply because they need to be accomplished. At a moment’s notice, he’ll scale the tallest skyscraper, drive his car off a cliff, or commit pages of bank-account numbers to memory, since the alternative is always the end of the world. As these films have gone on, they’ve become more and more fascinated with Hunt’s essential ludicrousness. Mission: Impossible—Fallout decrees him elemental—a crucial, indefinable component keeping the very fabric of humanity knitted together. The film is so dizzyingly fun that, at least while you’re watching, it seems like a sound conclusion. Since 1996, the Mission: Impossible franchise has been passed around from auteur to auteur, with Cruise as its constant. There was Brian De Palma, then John Woo, J. J. Abrams, Brad Bird, and Christopher McQuarrie. Fallout upsets that pattern by bringing McQuarrie back, though it’s hard to object given his first-rate work on Rogue Nation. This film is thus a more direct sequel, bringing back several characters: Hunley; Hunt’s loyal team of Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames); the villainous Solomon Lane (Sean Harris); and the steely MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who so impressively matched wits with Hunt last time around. Fallout also brings back the tried-and-tested narrative of Hunt’s incompatibility with his American-intelligence overseers, who again and again reject his go-for-broke derring-do as too risky and impetuous, and become convinced that he’s dangerous, crazy, evil, or a mix of all three. This time, the skeptical party is Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), a cool-headed CIA chief who assigns her top assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) to be Hunt’s shadow as they investigate the ongoing crimes of the Syndicate, a global terrorist cell made up of former secret agents. To Walker, Hunt and his crew are charlatans, merry clowns “playing Halloween” and risking lives with their death-defying stunts and fondness for elaborate mask-wearing identity scams. Why have all that fun, Walker figures, when you could just mow everyone down with machine guns? As it winds through each elaborate action set piece, Mission: Impossible—Fallout doubles as a manifesto for the ridiculous spy thriller, pitting Hunt’s boundless optimism against Walker’s cold-blooded realism. Early on in the film, Hunt lets a bad guy steal a briefcase of plutonium to save the life of a fellow agent. To Hunt, lost plutonium is something he can always get back, but a lost life is impossible to stomach; to the CIA, his empathy is his weakness. As such, this is a slyly political film at moments, with McQuarrie casting a pessimistic eye at the ruthlessness of America’s approach to espionage. Hunt and his fictional “Impossible Mission Force” are throwbacks, mascots for a kinder, increasingly imaginary-feeling United States. His deep love for his team is posited as a unique strength, something Walker just can’t grasp. Cruise, eternally energetic at the age of 56, leans into Hunt’s maniacal intensity, buttressed by each of McQuarrie’s incredibly staged action sequences (whether a soaring helicopter chase in the Himalayas or a cheekily intimate fight in a nightclub bathroom). Cavill plays Walker as a living wall, a menacingly strong clod with a head as thick as his biceps (and his admittedly lustrous mustache). At 147 minutes, Fallout is the longest and loopiest of the Mission: Impossibles, building on the plot intricacies of Rogue Nation (which is worth a rewatch if you’ve forgotten the details of Solomon Lane and his Syndicate). Past movies like Ghost Protocol largely dispensed with storytelling sophistication in favor of globe-trotting action. But in Fallout, McQuarrie insists on weaving it all together, calling back to most of the franchise’s previous entries at one point or another, adding to his grand notion that Hunt is more than just a glorified stuntman. Either way, by the time Hunt is dangling off his umpteenth cliff and trying, once again, to save the world before a ticking clock hits zero, it’s hard not to salute his persistence in the name of giddy entertainment value.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," ¿Qué es lo que nos atrae, lo que más nos lleva a esperar una Misión: Imposible tras otra? Y eso que la primera, dirigida por Brian De Palma, fue, lejos, pero lejos, la más floja de las seis que desde hace 22 años protagoniza Tom Cruise. Quien, dicho sea de paso, no parece tener 56 años. Se sabe: el actor de Rain Man y Top Gun hace las tomas de riesgo sin aceptar que lo doblen. ¿Vieron en el backstage cómo se lastimó el tobillo saltando de una terraza a otra en Londres? Si lo vieron, vieron también los cables de los que cuelga y que luego digitalmente se borran. ¿Será eso, ver a un actor saltar edificios en Londres, correr endemoniadamente, ir a alta velocidad en moto por las callecitas de París, o pilotear un helicóptero por Asia? Porque esa verosimilitud que Cruise le da al agente Ethan Hunt no está en la trama de sus películas, en las increíbles secuencias de acción, peleas o persecuciones. Ahí hay que dejarse llevar por lo que se siente, cierta adrenalina, y olvidar las reglas del relato convencional del cine. Y en Repercusión –como en Nación secreta, dirigida también por Christopher McQuarrie: caramba, ganador del Oscar por el guión de Los sospechosos de siempre, y nuevo gran amigo de Cruise, y quien escribió muchos de los guiones de sus últimas películas- la trama es lo de menos. Para los ansiosos: hay tres esferas de plutonio que se han “extraviado”, y que están por llegar a las manos de un ahora terrorista y anarquista - Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), villano de la quinta MI-. Y si Hunt no las consigue -una se la perdió por defender la integridad física de uno de sus asistentes-, otra vez, el mundo estará en peligro. A los rostros conocidos de Misión: Imposible –Simon Pegg, el wizard de la tecnología; Ving Rhames, experto en bombas ambos compañeros de Hunt en FMI (por Fuerza Misión Imposible, nada que ver con el Fondo Monetario) y Alec Baldwin (su jefe), se suman otras caras femeninas asiduas, como la Ilsa Faust que compone Rebecca Ferguson, y el amor de la vida de Hunt (Michelle Monaghan). Agreguen a Vanessa Kirby (la princesas Margaret en The Crown) como la Viuda Blanca, una femme fatale, y un agente de la CIA al que adosan en la misión a Hunt, que compone Henry Cavill, el último Superman. Lo dicho: no pidan verosimilitud, porque Repercusión es, más que las anteriores, una suma de escenas de acción, eso sí, magníficamente rodadas y presentadas. Que tienen eso, acción, pero también humor y sorpresa. Las vueltas de tuerca son una marca registrada en las MI, así que a disfrutar sin temer sentirse engañado, porque total, aquí se engaña a cualquiera.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018",This is sure-handed filmmaking that fires on every conceivable cylinder.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," As if climbing up the Burj Khalifa and hanging off an airborne plane were not enough, Cruise offers at least four white-knuckle segments in Fallout. Barely 15 minutes into the direct sequel to 2015's Rogue Nation, Cruise makes history by becoming the first actor to execute the Halo (high altitude low opening) jump from the height of 25,000 feet (7,620m). The most spectacular sequence is the high-stakes helicopter chase, where Cruise has to be a pilot, an actor and a camera operator at the same time. Then again, that is the hallmark of a Mission: Impossible film. It is all about practical stunts, practical action and real locations, and Cruise delivers them 100 per cent. While Cruise is always at the forefront in the series, his castmates get bigger play this time. Rebecca Ferguson's British agent Ilsa is a welcome return and Henry Cavill's CIA assassin Walker also contributes to make this actioner so gripping. THE SKINNY: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team must protect the world from a nuclear threat. CIA agent Walker (Cavill) is sent to be his babysitter and Ilsa’s (Ferguson) reappearance throws a
spanner in the works.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Towards the end of the rip-roaring new Mission: Impossible  film, Julia (Michelle Monaghan) asks how her husband (from whom she has long been separated) is getting on. “Same old Ethan,” comes the reply. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), she learns, is still as busy as ever saving the world. On his latest assignment, with three nuclear weapons potentially set to explode within 72 hours, he doesn’t have much time to spare for his loved ones. In a hostage situation, Ethan will always try to protect the life of the individual captive even if that means putting the rest of humanity at risk. On occasion, he can appear very sentimental indeed but the women in his life have long ago realised that, no, he is not going to bring them breakfast in bed. Tom Cruise doesn’t wear a top hat or look like Fred Astaire, but the pleasure in the Mission: Impossible franchise is very similar to that given by the best Astaire musicals. “Either the camera dances or I do,” Astaire famously proclaimed. He refused to rely on clever editing to drive his routines. Cruise’s Ethan has a similar down and dirty approach. The Mission: Impossible films don’t skimp on the special effects but one of their defining and most exhilarating traits is that they seem rooted in realism. If Cruise jumps off a plane, we will see him doing so in full frame and the sequence will be filmed in a single shot. If he is wrestling his main antagonist on top of a cliff, the camera will pull back so we can see for ourselves that there isn’t any scaffolding or soft landing area, just a vertiginous drop below him. Almost all the stunts and action sequences here are superbly choreographed. They need to be because the storyline is even flimsier here than in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s previous feature, Rogue Nation. Under scrutiny, the plot structure is just as likely to collapse as the make-believe chamber here in which Ethan and his IMF (Impossible Missions Force) colleagues conduct an interrogation of a rogue scientist, somehow convincing him that he is in a real army hospital. Ethan can’t stay put in one country for long. For no discernible reason, he is in Belfast when he receives a hollowed-out copy of Homer’s The Odyssey containing a secret recording offering his next mission… should he care to take it. Terrorist group The Apostles have been busy spreading smallpox in Kashmir and now its demented anarchist members have an even more fiendish plan involving stolen plutonium. Inspired by their imprisoned leader, Solomon Lane (the still sneering and gimlet-eyed Sean Harris), they work on the basis that global peace can only be achieved through “great suffering”. By blowing up large tracts of the globe or exposing it to pestilence, they hope to bring humanity together in its wretchedness and to put in place a new world order (or something like that). Henry Cavill is used to being the leading man. He has played Clark Kent several times and generally takes top billing. Here, however, he is strictly second fiddle to Cruise. In this double act, he is the straight man. Cruise gets the best lines, while Cavill is left to scowl and plot mischief in the passenger seat or to lurk in the background. He plays an American assassin who works for CIA boss Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett). She has instructed him to take over Ethan’s mission. Ethan’s own boss Hunley (Alec Baldwin) is in a power struggle with Sloane. This is one of those films in which heroes and villains are continually blurred. We are never sure who is trying to kill Ethan, who is trying to help him and who is simply there for the money. The only two people he can completely trust are his faithful sidekicks Luther (Ving Rhames, who has been in the series since the start) and the hypochondriacal Brit, Benji (Simon Pegg, who again gets many of the film’s best comic scenes). Rebecca Ferguson reappears as secret agent Ilsa Faust. It’s not clear at first whether she is there as his love interest or as his nemesis, or whether she is on a completely different mission of her own. New to the cast is the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), a very glamorous and untrustworthy socialite who combines hosting charity dinners with arms dealing. She is the dishonest broker between the security forces, the scientists and the terrorists.  After escaping an attack by what he claims was a 70-foot shark, Jonas Taylor must confront his fears to save those trapped in a sunken submersible.   FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader Will Sawyer is framed for setting fire to the tallest building in the world and must rescue his family who are trapped inside - at the top.   When the puppet cast of an '80s children's TV show begins to get murdered one by one, a disgraced LAPD detective-turned-private eye puppet takes on the case.   The film, produced by Get Out's Jordan Peele, is set in the early 70s and follows Washington's Ron Stallworth who, after becoming the first African-American detective on the Colorado Springs Police Department, sets out to infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan while posing as a racist extremist.   An elite American intelligence officer, aided by a top-secret tactical command unit, tries to smuggle a mysterious police officer with sensitive information out of the country.   The film tells the story of American hero and former LAPD detective, Russell Poole as he works the 1997 murder cases of rappers Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G.   A rare thriller from Bridesmaids director following a mummy vlogger who seeks to uncover the truth behind her best friend Emily's sudden disappearance from their small town.   A former wrestler and his family make a living performing at small venues around the country while his kids dream of joining World Wrestling Entertainment.   A young orphan named Lewis Barnavelt aids his magical uncle in locating a clock with the power to bring about the end of the world.   Seven strangers, each with a secret to bury, meet at Lake Tahoe's El Royale, a rundown hotel with a dark past. Over the course of one fateful night, everyone will have a last shot at redemption - before everything goes to hell.   A look at the life of the astronaut, Neil Armstrong, and the legendary space mission that led him to become the first man to walk on the Moon on July 20, 1969.   A human child raised by wolves must face off against a menacing tiger named Shere Khan, as well as his own origins in this live-action adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's novel.   The story of two American soldiers behind enemy lines on D Day that may or may not be another film set in JJ Abrams’ Cloverfield world.   Set in contemporary Chicago, amidst a time of turmoil, four women with nothing in common except a debt left behind by their dead husbands' criminal activities, take fate into their own hands, and conspire to forge a future on their own terms.  The story of teenager Richard Wershe Jr., who became an undercover informant for the FBI during the 1980s and was ultimately arrested for drug-trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.   Many years after the ""Sixty Minute War,"" cities survive a now desolate Earth by moving around on giant wheels attacking and devouring smaller towns to replenish their resources.  The plotting is a bit of an afterthought. What matters is the action. Highlights here include a stand-off in an underground car park, a brutal fight sequence in the gents, a riveting car and motorbike chase through the maze-like streets of Paris that puts old Steve McQueen movies to shame, a harum-scarum foot chase that takes Cruise across rooftops and bridges from St Paul’s Cathedral to Tate Modern (and reportedly resulted in him breaking his ankle), the obligatory parachute and skydiving scenes, a helicopter battle and a clifftop climax.  Cruise, Hollywood’s most durable star, has had a couple of recent screen disappointments, among them the half-baked horror movie The Mummy and the surprisingly dour Jack Reacher: Never Go Back. However, Mission: Impossible – Fallout reinforces his credentials as the Peter Pan-like action man who never seems to age or to stay still. He tackles his role with such relish that he leaves everyone else trailing in his wake. As soon as that familiar music is heard on the soundtrack, he is off like a whirling dervish set loose. From the film’s opening to its end credits, he hardly stops moving for an instant. The film takes its breakneck tempo from him. That is why it makes such invigorating but exhausting viewing.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Just as James Brown was once known as the hardest working man in show business, Mission Impossible: Fallout, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, feels like the hardest working blockbuster in Hollywood. It’s simply the most. It has the biggest stunts, the most extravagant sets, the most glamorous movie stars, and the twistiest twists; you really feel like you’re getting your money’s worth. If Tom Cruise ever dies (yes, “if”), you imagine it would be on set, in the middle of some stunt atop the Petronas Towers, his lil’ heart finally unable to match his lil’ legs’ commitment. Giving his life to this franchise would be the only fitting end to his career. Cruise is the perfect star for this film, a guy whose battles with alien spirits in his mind seem to give him the confidence to dangle from helicopters in real life. You kind of have to hand it to him. Likewise, Fallout is so perfectly “blockbuster” that you can’t help but chuckle in admiration. Based on sheer laugh volume, it might be the best comedy of the Summer. It’s not that you’re laughing at the movie, in fact it’s almost the opposite. You go in with a fairly accurate pre-conceived notion of what it’s going to be like, and it turns out to be so perfectly that that it’s somehow surprising. You’re not giggling because it breaks character, you’re giggling because it’s so insanely in character. Cruise plays agent Ethan Hunt of the IMF (Impossible Missions Force). Hunt keeps having flashbacks of his wedding to his estranged wife (Michelle Monaghan) in some preposterously picturesque lake in the Alps, that quickly turn into nightmares about the global anarchist (!) he put away (“Solomon Lane,” played by Sean Harris, the gay assassin from The Borgias) who apparently wants to kill her. But Hunt had better stay focused on the present, because he’s also trying to stop Lane’s group of anarchists, The Apostles, from acquiring plutonium cores from a shadowy broker named “John Lark,” who, with the help of a sexy arms merchant named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), are going to spring Lane, employ a rogue Norwegian rocket scientist, infiltrate global governments, and blow things up with nuclear weapons or something. Phew! In order to stop this, Ethan Hunt has to jump out of a plane; drive a motorcycle, a BMW, a European moving truck, a boat, and a helicopter; and run, jump, fall, shoot, tumble, climb, and parkour, all while bantering with his sidekicks (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg), fending off a rival agent (a burly CIA man played by hunky Henry Cavill) and being the love ideal of three different beautiful women (Monaghan, Kirby, and MI 6 agent Ilsa Faust, played by Rebecca Ferguson). Is that a lot for one movie? Oh God yes. Does it take too long to resolve it all? Indubitably. But you don’t really need to understand who everyone is or why they’re double-crossing each other (or triple, or quadruple), because it’s excess itself that’s the point. Fallout doesn’t have a coherent story so much as an impeccable sense of comedic timing. Just when you think the action is the most death-defying it could possibly be, in the most exotic locale, it goes three levels more. There’s a Kashmir-set helicopter duel sequence near the end that’s basically the Baba Booey of action sequences. It’s funny, then it’s silly, then it’s dumb, and then it comes all the way back to being amazing again. You kind of have to hand it to them. Of course, none of this would work nearly so well if the action wasn’t well-staged, and Fallout is legitimately one of the best combinations of choreography, stunts, FX, and cinematography I’ve ever seen. There’s a fight in a bathroom that had me giggling so hard I had to cover my mouth. Not because it was silly, but because it was so over-the-top brutal. Everything looked like it would really hurt, and not because it was “gritty,” or even especially realistic. My rational brain knows porcelain doesn’t really shatter like that, but the point isn’t literal realism. McQuarrie’s action isn’t the best because it’s the fastest or the thumpiest (though it’s certainly fast and thumpy), it’s the best because he never forgets he’s telling a story. The actors always have a motivation, as clear in a cacophonous fight as it is in a quiet love scene. Likewise, it’s not all excess and great hair that make Fallout work (though everyone’s hair does looks incredible). It also has a genuine moral center. In the midst of a nearly incomprehensibly convoluted plot, it drives home one idea above all: that Ethan Hunt is the hero because he cares about collateral damage. He’s the hero because he refuses to sacrifice one or two lives for the good of the many. I know, it’s not exactly a revolutionary thought, that a hero should care about every life. In a different time and place it would already be hopelessly cliché. But for a long time the trend has gone in the opposite direction. Towards heroes who were “tough” because they had precisely the emotional detachment that could allow lesser people to die for a greater good. Starting in the Bush years, this was an aspect of almost every action protagonist, from Jack Bauer in 24 to superheroes who threw each other through buildings without apparent thought as to who was inside. Josh Brolin’s character in Sicario 2 kills a “terrorist’s” entire family in one of the first scenes — though in that case the filmmakers’ defense would surely be that they weren’t trying to glorify his character (which I don’t believe for a second). Pop culture is more a reflection of political trends than a driver, but it’s never fun to watch the most unexamined aspects of the zeitgeist simply regurgitated with flashy effects. And this trend in television and movies mirrors policy. A recent piece in Rolling Stone notes that US drones killed 1,147 people while targeting 41 terrorists. In other attacks on 14 men, they killed 142 children. That civilian casualties are acceptable in the service of killing “bad guys” is something so take for granted, both onscreen and in life, that it hardly warrants debate anymore. Just two days ago the LAPD killed an innocent bystander firing into a crowd. These ideas are far from the only thing that matter, but they do matter. Ethan Hunt caring about killing a cop or a kid isn’t going to change any of that, but it’s nice to see art that offers hope, that doesn’t treat indiscriminate murder with a shrug. And the palpable earnestness of this sentiment is a nice complement to a big, ridiculous, hilarious bubblegum action movie. We always want the “good guy” to win, but it’s refreshing when someone puts a little thought into what being a good guy actually means. Mission Impossible: Fallout is not a triumph of literal realism, orderly plotting, or restraint, but it’s proof that thoughtful execution, comedic timing, and a true moral center count for much more.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout (25 July) proves that it isn’t the Bourne series that James Bond has to compete with any more, but this running-and-shooting-and-leaping-off-buildings secret agent franchise. In the hands of the writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, it has become everything that recent Bond films have failed to be: fun but not dumb, serious but not glum, frantic yet always lucid, and with an array of dynamic roles for women including Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan and Angela Bassett. As elite operative Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise is still hurling himself from rooftops at an age (56) when he should only really be up there if he’s replacing tiles. This time he’s facing off against John Lark and the Apostles, a volatile cadre of terrorists-for-hire rather than the ropy pub band that their name suggests. Sean Harris is back as the villain from the last film, hissing and mumbling like a cut-price Mark Rylance, and the MacGuffin is looking a bit tired. Stolen plutonium, really? Did Doc Brown from Back to the Future get shot by the Libyans for nothing? But all that is offset by Cruise’s sweetly incredulous performance and some ambitious set pieces: a balletic martial arts dust-up in the men’s bathroom and a climax featuring duelling, slaloming helicopters high above Kashmir. A shame that Cruise’s co-star, Henry Cavill, has let the side down with his ill-considered remarks about pursuing women in the #MeToo era. That will remove for some viewers the narrative ambiguity about whether he is playing hero or villain, though perhaps his porn-star moustache would’ve had that effect already. If your fancy remains untickled, there are other summer viewing options. Try the new cross-platform, global-branding synergy hub – sorry, I mean “movie” – from Marvel Studios: Ant-Man and the Wasp (3 August). With this miniature superhero, every day can be Flying Ant Day. The previous Ant-Man featured a nice Cure gag – this one name-drops Morrissey, but surely misses a trick in not making him the villain. For those who prefer sequels featuring Abba rather than ants, there’s Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again (out now) reuniting Meryl Streep and Cher 35 years after Silkwood. The writer-director Ol Parker told me that he used The Godfather Part II as one of his inspirations. In which case, I can’t wait to hear the line: “I know it was you, Fernando.” For my money, though, the hit of the summer was already decided a month ago: it’s the cinema air-conditioning systems, of course. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," For the last week or so, Ive watched people react ecstatically to Mission: Impossible  Fallout. The sixth film in Tom Cruises bespoke action franchise  reshaped around its producer/star in 1996 from the bones of a beloved but barely-remembered 60s television series  has been received by critics and celebrity Twitter users alike as the reinvention of the action movie, a celebration of physical risk and practical stunt work. And if thats all that Fallout was, theyd be justified in their praise. But writer/director Christopher McQuarries follow-up to his own Rogue Nation is really two movies. One of them is indeed an incredibly satisfying, preposterously outsized celebration of old-school action  and, perhaps, Cruises perpetual death wish. But the other is an overlong, indifferently written franchise instalment that suggests the Mission: Impossible series  after six features and 22 years  should maybe just wrap things up. Rogue Nation played as a sly greatest-hits collection while introducing Rebecca Fergusons British operative agent Ilsa Faust, who was not just the equal of Cruises Ethan Hunt but of his entire team it was lean, it was smart and it was a great deal of fun. Fallout finds McQuarrie working overtime to craft a direct sequel that somehow places the previous films captured villain, the sneering Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), at the centre of a weaponized-plutonium crisis that threatens global stability. Theres also a new threat, a mysterious string-puller called John Lark bent on remaking the world through mass murder, scaling up the activities of Lanes malevolent Syndicate to their logical end point. Really, though, its all just an excuse for Cruise and company to race through a series of elaborate set pieces in exotic locations, defying death (and physics) while clocks tick, trackers are planted and composer Lorne Balfe finds new ways to riff on Lalo Schifrins earworm theme music. And while those set pieces  including a frantic two-stage vehicular chase through the streets of Paris, a foot race across London office buildings and a freaking helicopter duel in the mountains of Kashmir  are executed brilliantly, and photographed with striking clarity and invention by cinematographer Rob Hardy, the movie still feels like less than the sum of its parts  a machine built on the same startling betrayals and unexpected reversals that these movies always deploy to keep us off balance. You can enjoy the moments (and clearly, audiences are doing exactly that), but on balance its not as interesting or engaging a Mission: Impossible movie as the last three. Maybe the supporting cast has grown too large to comfortably juggle maybe Cruise, at 56, is just too old to play the role of the perpetual underdog, especially when hes trading close-quarter blows with the likes of Ferguson, Henry Cavill and Yang Liang. Maybe the Mission: Impossible franchise has no place in the current political moment, where the threat of coordinated nuclear terrorism seems almost comforting as a worst-case scenario. (At no point does the IMF have to radically rethink their strategy in light of a cranky presidential tweet, for example.)",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2018"," CLEVELAND, Ohio - The truly impossible mission in ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is surprising the audience with something new after six movies. But somehow the movie succeeds. The MI franchise has already made billions for the studio, largely due to Tom Cruise as the outrageously resourceful Ethan Hunt. Co-stars Simon Pegg (as Benji Dunn) and Ving Rhames (as Luther Stickell) are almost as vital as comic relief, with Pegg and Rhames as all-around conscience, best buddy and technical genius. Henry Cavill, the guy who played Superman in recent flicks, has a pivotal role in the film where his overall straight-laced attitude fits. Rebecca Ferguson plays the role of confused girlfriend/rival secret agent perfectly, but Vanessa Kirby steals her thunder as the villainous White Widow. ""Mission: Impossible"" movies are synonymous with action, special effects and insane stunt work wrapped around convoluted plots that defy logic and science. ""Fallout"" is more of the same, ratcheted up a notch or two. To be honest, the nonstop action is exhausting, as Cruise and friends battle the bad guys (and maybe good guys; hard to tell) in the sewers of Paris, atop the buildings of London and in the sky over Norway (disguised as Kashmir). The basic plot, which gets twisted beyond recognition as good guys become bad guys and all variations in between, is that there are three plutonium cores the size of cantaloupes on the black market. Cruise is asked to get them back; if he fails, it's the end of the world. In other words, a pretty typical ""Mission: Impossible"" scenario. If the audience got a bit confused by the plot with the characters and their twisting loyalties, they didn't express it. There were shouts, applause and occasional inappropriate laughter at the press screening. Turns out it was not just good acting; Cruise actually broke his ankle during that stunt. The injury held up production for a while, but Cruise resumed his risky stunts once he was healed. ""Fallout"" isn't Shakespeare; it's high-voltage action and adrenaline. Sure, it's light on science and just about anything resembling reality and physics, but fans are not looking for realism. They want mind-numbing action, special effects and a good story.

"Jul 25, 2018"," There’s probably a film to be made (or a Saturday Night Live sketch) in which super-spy Ethan Hunt chooses not to accept his mission and elects, instead, to spend the weekend eating pizza and watching golf in his underwear. Who could blame him? Now six films into a Mission: Impossible franchise that shows no signs of losing steam, Hunt (played with notoriously reckless abandon by Tom Cruise) has saved the world enough to earn a lifetime of couch surfing. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns for Mission: Impossible – Fallout and delivers the strongest installment of the series. There’s a lot of hyperbole in the critical community claiming this might be the best action movie ever made. While that’s undoubtedly a stretch, there’s no denying the film’s excellence. More specifically, its concluding sequence – a spectacular multi-stranded sequence at the foot of a glacier in Kashmir – sets a new standard for over-the-top action set pieces. By now, the Mission: Impossible formula should be familiar. Something steep and unclimbable is climbed. There are aerial shenanigans that usually involve something crashing. Intricate car chases, usually involving at least one motorcycle, careening through major metropolitan areas. There are double-crosses, uncanny masks, and reversals of fortune. The conclusion involves the execution of a plan so complicated that even the characters involved seem confused. Oh, and there are fears that Ethan Hunt has ‘gone rogue’ from the shadowy spy organization, IMF. Here, the ‘fallout’ of Mission: Impossible – Fallout refers to the consequences of Ethan Hunt’s good intentions. As his IMF boss (Alec Baldwin) observes, Hunt has never been willing to sacrifice a single life, even with the promise of sparing millions in return. When forced to choose between three weapons-grade plutonium cores and the lives of his team (Ving Rhames as Luther ‘the man in the van’ Stickell and Simon Pegg as techno-nerd Benji), Hunt immediately sets about rescuing his pals. The loss of those plutonium cores fuels the globetrotting plot, which screams from Berlin to Paris to London like a high-speed locomotive. Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) returns as the primary baddie, still raw and vengeful after his capture at the end of 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation. Everyone in the intelligence community wants a piece of Lane, including a tough CIA director (Angela Bassett) and her trigger-happy henchman (Henry Cavill as ‘Walker’), as well as MI-6, which dispatches Hunt’s English counterpart and pseudo-girlfriend Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) to put a bullet in Lane’s noggin. It’s all absurdly complicated, with allegiances changing faster than the bandages on Tom Cruise’s knees. McQuarrie, Cruise’s scribe of choice, knows that clarity is a relative term in the Mission: Impossible universe. He need only explain enough to keep the audience oriented as the action barrels forward. Unlike most action directors, who occasionally bring things to a screeching halt to re-orient the viewer, McQuarrie resets our bearings in the middle of the action. It’s a fruitful approach that keeps things moving while testing each character’s mettle under duress. The results are not only thrilling, but surprisingly emotional, as we come to appreciate how much Hunt and Ilsa have to lose if the mission goes sideways. McQuarrie excels at imparting each scene with a propulsive momentum, partly through meticulously choreographed action scenes and the commitment of Cruise to perform his own stunts. You may have grown understandably tired of the accolades heaped upon Cruise for his daring-do, but it unquestionably impacts the pacing of the film, and for the better. Instead of being forced to cut his scenes rapidly – intercutting segments of the real Cruise with his stunt double – McQuarrie has the luxury of letting his scenes unfold through longer shots. We stay fixed on the action, giving the sense of one continuous scene rather than random bits cobbled together in an editing room. In other words, this shit is really happening. The formula of Mission: Impossible now solidified, the filmmakers can focus on making everything bigger and more spectacular. Mission: Impossible – Fallout wildly exceeds expectations on this front, often staging the action at teeth-chattering heights. The fisticuffs rival anything you might find in Chad Stahelski and David Leitch’s John Wick (2014) sometimes confined to tight quarters while other times sprawling across entire rooms. If you find the action in Mission: Impossible – Fallout to be pedestrian, it probably means you’re a disgruntled James Bond fan. Finding blemishes with McQuarrie’s creation is a challenge, as it ruthlessly provides about everything you could expect from a Hollywood actioner. Perhaps it might benefit from more humor (Simon Pegg is under-utilized in his comic relief role), but this is a decidedly straightforward affair that doesn’t have much time to wink at the camera. It could also use a bit more of the delightfully wicked Harris, who sounds like he just drank Tom Waits’ gravelly voice through a jagged straw. The cast is solid with the notable exception of Cavill who, though a commanding physical specimen, struggles to establish his presence on the screen. His wooden delivery and lack of comic timing stick out from the remaining ensemble cast, who play freely off one another with relative ease. But these are minor gripes with a first-rate action film. Though it lacks the gritty humanity of something like George Miller’s Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), Mission: Impossible – Fallout is no less impressive in its dedication to character-driven action and practical special effects. It’s a dazzling, non-stop thriller that’s sure to become an instant action classic. Ethan Hunt isn’t even close to letting go.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Chan made his reputation in Hong Kong, and later in Hollywood, for doing his own death-defying stunts. Once, he nearly did die, filming “The Armour of God,” when he jumped to a tree branch, which broke and sent him falling 40 feet onto his head. With the “Mission: Impossible” franchise — this one’s the sixth since the series started in 1996 — Cruise keeps raising the bar for outlandish stunts that are captured in a way that shows he’s the one doing them. Even in an age of computer-generated effects, where anything can be fudged or faked, Cruise’s dedication to keep it real is admirable, if a little bit insane. But it’s all to the good, if it means white-knuckle entertainment like this latest installment, possibly the best of the lot, and certainly the one that captures the team dynamic and smart pacing of the original TV series. The mission Cruise’s Ethan Hunt accepts at the start of “Fallout” is a continuation of the one that ended the last movie, “Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.” That movie’s baddie, anarchist mastermind Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), is in custody, thanks to Ethan — and being bounced from country to country for interrogation. But his followers, who call themselves The Apostles, are working around the world, and have gotten hold of three spherical canisters of plutonium, with which they aim to carry out Lane’s master plan to build nuclear weapons. Early on, Ethan gets his hands on the plutonium, but loses it — because he opted to save the life of his IMF teammate, Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames). His boss, The Secretary, Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), wants to give Ethan and his team another chance to retrieve the plutonium. But the CIA director, Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), will only approve if Ethan takes along her top assassin, August Walker (Henry Cavill), a mustachioed brute with a reputation for killing first and asking questions later. Ethan, Luther and tech genius Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) are pursuing the never-seen controller of the Apostles, known only as John Lark, first in Paris and later in London. The Paris sequence is dominated by a hellacious vehicle chase through the streets of Paris, which reunites Ethan with Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the seductive MI-6 agent from “Rogue Nation,” who wants Lane for her own reasons. Throughout it all, Ethan is plagued by demons. At night he dreams of his ex-wife, Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan), dying because Ethan couldn’t protect her. And Walker is becoming convinced that years of being disavowed by his government has made Ethan snap, and that Ethan is the mysterious John Lark, in league with Lane. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who directed “Rogue Nation” and Cruise’s first “Jack Reacher” movie, keeps the movie humming at peak performance. The plot delivers plenty of twists and turns, which come at the viewer at a rapid pace. The movie clocks in at just under 2-1/2 hours, but never feels stretched. Of course, the fun of a “MIssion: Impossible” movie is the action sequences, and McQuarrie sets up some doozies, Cruise throws himself into the stunt work, trading punches with Cavill, jumping between rooftops, performing his own high-altitude skydiving, and learning to fly a helicopter for a hell-for-leather aerial chase scene. (Cruise broke his ankle during one of the rooftop jumps, and the shot's still in the film.) The realism of Cruise’s stunt work — that gasp when you realize he’s doing these things himself — is what makes “Mission: Impossible - Fallout” so invigorating. It’s great to see a performer of Cruise’s stature risk life and limb for our enjoyment, and he seems to get a kick out of doing it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018","Look, I'm not made of stone: Pretty much everything in Mission: Impossible-Fallout is fun.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Great action movies develop a rhythm like no other genre. Think of the way the stunts in “Mad Max: Fury Road” become a part of the storytelling. Think of how “Die Hard” flows so smoothly from scene to scene, making us feel like we’re right there with John McClane. Think of the dazzling editing of “Baby Driver” and the way it incorporates sound design, music, and action into a seamless fabric that’s toe-tapping. It’s obviously incredible praise to say that “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” reminds me of these films. It’s got that finely-tuned, perfect blend of every technical element that it takes to make a great action film, all in service of a fantastic script and anchored by great action performances to not just work within the genre but to transcend it. This is one of the best movies of the year. And, man, does “Fallout” go. Roughly seven of the ten best action sequences of the year will be from this film. There’s a wonderful diversity in action styles too from a skydiving nightmare to a car chase to, of course, a “Run Tom!” scene to the already-famous helicopter sequence. All of them feature an intensity of movement that we hardly see in action movies anymore. Critics have already compared the film to “Fury Road” and I think that’s why—the fluidity of motion that you see in both films. The great cinematographer Rob Hardy (“Annihilation”) and editor Eddie Hamilton (who did the last movie as well) have refined the action here with McQuarrie in such a perfect way. We rarely lose the geography of scenes—which is so common in bad action—and often feel like we’re falling, speeding, or running with Hunt. The audience I saw it with was gasping and nervously laughing with each heart-racing sequence. See this one with a crowd. And as big as you can (some of the footage was shot in IMAX, and it’s worth the upcharge). It’s easy to get cynical at the movies. With eight sequels in the top ten last week, more and more people see the Hollywood machine as just that, something that spits out product instead of art or even entertainment. Perhaps the best thing I can say about “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is that it destroys cynicism. It truly does what so many people have looked for in entertainment for over a century—a chance for real-world worries to take a back seat for a couple hours. You’ll be too busy worrying how Ethan Hunt is going to get out of this one to care about anything outside the theater. It's a rare action movie that can do that so well that you not only escape but walk out kind of invigorated and ready to take on the world. “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” is one of those movies.

"Jul 25, 2018"," Like any of the five previous installments in Tom Cruise’s astonishingly popular Mission: Impossible franchise, knowing as little as possible about Mission: Impossible – Fallout before stepping into the theatre the more likely the viewer is going to have one heck of a terrific night out at the movies. Not because the plot is overly intricate and filled with unexpected twists and turns, (in all honesty figuring out where this latest installment is headed is fairly easy), but more because you’ll have less of an idea the crackerjack practical stunts the filmmakers have devised for their international superstar actor to try and survive this time around. In this entry of the series it’s more motorcycle action, a halo jump, bathroom fisticuffs and a crackerjack helicopter chase where Cruise actually pilots the darned thing himself (but not before hanging off the side of it for a good two or three minutes before taking the controls). It’s all as crazy as it sounds. Better, it’s even more entertaining. As good as this series has been and as much as 2011’a Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol has towered above them all for some time now, this sixth entry is the new high water mark for the franchise. Returning Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation writer/director Christopher McQuarrie has raised the stakes to such an extent I’m almost flabbergasted by what it is he has achieved. The first direct sequel, it’s almost as if he used that 2015 hit as a dry run for all he was going to attempt this time around. There is a fluidity and a cohesiveness to the storytelling that’s spectacular. Couple that with the type of action the likes of which Howard Hawks, John Frankenheimer and William Friedkin would stand up and cheer and we have all the makings of a sensation that ranks right up there with some of the finest the genre has produced during the 21st century. With the capture of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the Syndicate is in shambles. But a number of their operatives are still at-large, and considering how dangerous they are it’s no wonder putting them behind bars and spoiling their various terrorist plots has become the Impossible Mission Force’s (IMF) number one priority. After an attempt to stop the group, now calling themselves The Apostles, from obtaining three plutonium cores goes off the rails, under order from the President Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his team now find their every move shadowed by the C.I.A. Remorseless killer August Walker (Henry Cavill) isn’t just an observer, he’s also around to make sure no one deviates from their mission to locate the plutonium before the Apostles can manufacture and detonate a trio of nuclear bombs. If they do, he’s got orders from his boss Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to use whatever force he deems necessary, including lethal, to get them back on track. There are complications, not the least of which is the fact Hunt and Walker unsurprisingly don’t trust one another. But former MI6 agent Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) is also hanging around for some reason, while a secretive arms dealer known as The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) with link’s to Hunt’s past holds vital information that will hopefully lead the IMF agents to the plutonium. Additionally, there’s a mystery man calling himself “John Lark” who appears to be orchestrating events in ways that defy rational belief, The Apostles apparently looking to him as their new leader with Lane incarcerated. As much as Hunt is loath to admit it, the key to solving this mystery might just be contained in the head of the one man who came the closest to ruining his life and murdering all he held dear not so long ago: the aforementioned Solomon Lane, the former head of the Syndicate. Pulling from a variety of sources for inspiration (most notably John le Carré’s spy novels, James Bond, John Boorman’s Point Blank and Jackie Chan’s Police Story series), McQuarrie magically balances a myriad of varying characters and subplots without losing sight of the bigger picture. Interspersed between bouts of cleverly crafted pieces of exposition the director stages astonishing sequences of mayhem that get bigger, bolder and more impressive as events catapult their way to a conclusion. T the director also plants a number of witty callbacks to all five of the previous Mission: Impossible installments and does so in a way that feels authentically organic to this story and not placed there just as some hackneyed piece of misbegotten fan service. Instead, these moments all help push the plot forward, and whether it be remembering the circumstances in which “Job” met “Max” or recollecting that Hunt enjoys taking vacations free-climbing walls of jagged rock, McQuarrie freely pulls from his hero’s past in order to make his and his team’s future prospects feel even more in jeopardy. But it is the orgiastic nature of the action sequences that are undeniably the true draw here. The bare-knuckles bathroom showdown which shows Hunt and Walker barely able to fend off an unknown mystery assailant. A spellbinding sprint over the rooftops of London featuring a breakneck leap that resulted in Cruise breaking an ankle (which also happens to be the take used in the movie). A motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris that’s a full-throttle, viscerally intense spine-tingler that puts near-perfect similar sequences in both Mission: Impossible II and Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation to absolute shame. A mountaintop face-off between predator and prey that culminates with some of the more jaw-dropping cliff dangling this side of 1993’s Cliffhanger. A high-altitude aerial duel between a pair of helicopters with, as already mentioned, Cruise piloting one of the whirlybirds himself. McQuarrie stages it all magnificently. With gigantic assists from cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation), editor Eddie Hamilton (Kingsman: The Golden Circle) and composer Lorne Balfe (The Florida Project), the director achieves a primeval elegance that’s heart-stopping. As much as I enjoyed many of his previous endeavors behind the camera, most notably his first Cruise collaboration Jack Reacher, never has McQuarrie showcased the level of craftsmanship, care and attention to every minute detail as he does here. I loved the way that the script ties up some of the loose ends left dangling from previous installments, most notably ones concerning Hunt’s feelings for his in-hiding ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and how she in turn continues to feel for him. I also adored how the director gave Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) new things to do while at the same time exploring just how important their friendship with their IMF team leader has somehow managed to become over the past two decades. Most of all, he allows the viewer insight into the toll these 22 years of government service have exacted upon our hero, and even if Hunt doesn’t look like he has any intent to slow down anytime soon, it’s equally clear that no matter how good the mask the battle scars of his various ordeals can no longer be hidden quite like they used to be. It’s easy to think, especially after Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and its exhilarating Burj Khalifa climbing sequence and Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation and its dangling from the exterior door of an Airbus A400M Atlas during takeoff pre-credits prologue, that the only reason this series continues to fascinate audiences around the globe is the sight of a now 56-year-old Cruise laying his life on the line to do almost all of these stunts himself. As astonishing as that might be, and it’s admittedly something else and I don’t think we’ve seen its like since Jackie Chan during his Police Story III: Supercop heyday, I think the reason that these films continue to resonate has more to do with the fact they put character and story first before the action, that component the key ingredient that I believe keeps bringing people back to see more. While some installments are certainly more successful than others, at its absolute worst every entry in this series has still been a good one worthy of multiple watches. The same cannot be said about James Bond. It cannot be said about Jack Ryan. It cannot be said about Jason Bourne. Heck, it can’t even be said about other long-running, big budget Hollywood sci-fi fare like Star Trek, the Marvel Cinematic Universe or even Star Wars. So when I say Mission: Impossible – Fallout isn’t just the best film of the series but one of the great action epics of our time know that I mean it, McQuarrie lighting the fuse on a piece of high-octane summertime entertainment we’re going to be excitedly talking about for a quite awhile to come.

"Jul 25, 2018"," There he is, one of the most successful actors in cinema history, a very wealthy man, an extremely popular guy - and apparently a rather decent chap, too. And here he is, risking life and limb once again in this latest Mission: Impossible blockbuster. Between jumping out of planes, hanging out of helicopters, driving a motorbike at high speed against traffic in Paris, or leaping between buildings in London, the Cruiser is up to his old tricks (and then some) with a series of death-defying stunts as IMF action man Ethan Hunt. At one stage watching the film, I instinctively reached for a safety belt to clip into as I feared for my safety. Being acrophobic and watching Tom Cruise bouncing around on a ridiculously high cliff-edge is not a good mix. But this, the sixth Mission: Impossible movie and probably the best, is far more than the impressive/obsessive Cruise stunts. For starters, Rogue Nation director/writer Christopher McQuarrie is the first helmer to be asked back, and - remarkably - he's taken the template to an even higher level than his dynamic 2015 debut. The conflict between personal loyalties and the common good is at the centre of it all, with Henry Cavill joining regulars such as Cruise, Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg as August Winter, a CIA assassin who is embedded with the IMF as they endeavour to retrieve some stolen plutonium and, y'know, save the world. Rebecca Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan reprise their roles as former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust and Ethan Hunt's ex-wife Julia, while Angela Bassett and Vanessa Kirby swell the impressive female presence as CIA director Erika Sloane and the duplicitous Alana AKA The White Widow. © RTÉ 2024.

"Jul 25, 2018"," I have no idea what actually went into the making of “Mission: Impossible - Fallout,” but I like to think that the process went something like this: Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie set up a, well, impossible scenario for Tom Cruise to work his way out of and then, once it was resolved, said, ""Let’s make the next one even more impossible."" “Fallout” plays like a kind of “Mission: Impossible” greatest-hits album. If you like the franchise, you’ll love it. If you don’t ... well, you still might. It has the requisite plot twists, identity changes, pulse-pounding action sequences and absolutely insane Cruise stunts that make the films so much fun. The plot is at once simple and so insanely convoluted that it doesn’t really matter. Here’s the short(ish) version: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) gets another mission, should he decide to accept it, that involves fallout from previous missions. Bad guys have the ingredients to make three nuclear bombs. Ethan has to prevent this, along with Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg, underused). Ethan shows a hint of conscience, which complicates matters. So does the arrival of August Walker (Henry Cavill, really fun), an agent who does not share that conscience. There is the usual globetrotting and mask-wearing and craziness. But what REALLY throws a wrench into the works is the arrival of Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), whom Ethan thought was out of the game but, of course, is not. Best for you to find out for yourself how she fits into the story; suffice it to say that she is equally adept at being both the object of Ethan’s affection and the burr under his saddle. She’s really good, and one of the strengths of the movie is the strength of her character. Again, without saying too much, she’s not anything close to the damsel in distress. In fact, she is as adept at bailing people out as she is at causing a little distress of her own. That’s one of the few things that will capture your attention between the action scenes. And she’s involved in a lot of them. This is not to say that McQuarrie didn’t pay attention to the details of the story. He did — more than you are likely to. That pays off in important ways. Of course, the most important element of these films is Cruise. People dislike him personally for various reasons, but there is no denying that he is a movie star, maybe the last of them. What’s good about him is that he doesn’t sell that aspect of his talents short — mostly that consists of looking like he’s still 30 while romping around in dangerous ways — but he’s still an underrated actor. That combination means that when he’s on-screen, which is most of the time, you’re paying attention. It helps to have Cavill and Ferguson playing opposite him, and Alec Baldwin is a welcome presence in a glorified cameo. We also see characters from previous films return that make it seems as if it would be OK if this were the last movie in the franchise. It won’t be, of course. It’ll make a ton of money, and Cruise will decide he needs to be flattened by a concrete roller or something. But whether it’s the next in a long line or a summation of a fun series, “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is a movie that all but defines escapism at its finest.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," It was a movie that, for a few moments last year, we may never have got this summer. One day, in the heat of London’s sunshine months, Tom Cruise was racing across rooftops for his latest stunt when he landed awkwardly and broke his ankle. Six months out the doctors told him – weeks later, undeterred and more determined, he was back running around the capital, racing to finish the sixth installment in time for its July release. And thank god he did – because Mission: Impossible – Fallout is absolutely spectacular, and arguably the best IMF outing thus far. Fallout follows on a couple of years after the events of Rogue Nation when Ethan Hunt and his crew had successfully eradicated The Syndicate and its leader Soloman Lane (Sean Harris). However, just as they have cut off one head, another sprouts up in its place and the IMF are soon faced with The Disciples, a new group of international terrorists that  hope to break Lane out of prison and utilise stolen weapons of mass destruction around the globe. To add to the IMF’s problems is continuous probes from the CIA who seem the group’s actions as suspect and assign agent August Walker (Cavill) to them to oversee their plans to apprehend the Disciples. Uniquely, Fallout has gone against in precedent for hiring new filmmakers for each film by retaining writer/director Christopher McQuarrie after his brilliant previous entry, and his working relationship with Cruise has gone from strength to strength over recent years and upon seeing the finished product, you wonder who could have done a better job. As thrilling as Rogue Nation but with a narrative that’s as compelling as it is ludicrous, Fallout is the series’ shining success (well, they’re all great) and owes debts to the thrillers of the 1970s as its does such modern filmmakers as Chris Nolan and Michael Mann. It feels more expansive in scope but also in real-world setting and consequence and it’s the richer for it. Cruise, always the series’ ringleader, is his usual mix of energy and charm (there really isn’t anyone like him, is there?) and his passion for the series is as infectious as it ever has been. He, and I’m sure McQuarrie, know that if a seventh film is to happen (of course it will), it will be quite the challenge to top this one but if they keep Pegg, Rhames and Ferguson as part of the package, there’s always a chance. Meanwhile, Cavill adds a new dimension to proceedings and, after his short shrift during his stint as the Man of Steel, he showcases his immense talents in a darker role than we have seen from him. For sheer exhilaration, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an easy recommendation but it’s so much more than that: a rich, dark and thoughtful thriller, this is a different beast entirely and McQuarrie and Cruise have pulled off the, well, impossible in besting not just Bond or Bourne, but many of the most excellent of comic-book films of recent years. For action and smarts, there hasn’t been anything like this for a long time, and we demand more immediately. Phenomenal.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018",Cruise once again shows that being 56-years-old is no barrier to being an action hero while the movie itself proves that being a summer blockbuster cash cow that doesn't veer wildly from the unexpected doesn't have to be uninspired.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Twenty-two years since Tom Cruise first played super spy Ethan Hunt, the actor is back for a sixth outing which could well be the best of the series. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is full of outrageous stunts, exotic locales, an engrossing plot and nerve-shredding tension, with writer-director Christopher McQuarrie serving up an old-fashioned action movie that draws from earlier episodes and, somehow, puts a new spin on familiar tropes. Searching for three missing plutonium spheres, Hunt is joined by his IMF teammates Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), as well as a CIA brute, August Walker (Henry Cavill), who is there to oversee the mission. Also in the frame is a British broker named The White Widow (The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby) and terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), Hunt’s nemesis from the previous instalment Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation . There’s even time for familiar female faces – fellow spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunt’s lost love Julia (Michelle Monaghan) – to reappear in a story that carefully balances global peril with personal high stakes. The first director to return for a second Mission movie, McQuarrie moves the story along from the streets of Paris to the rooftops of London to the mountains of Kashmir with ruthless efficiency. It’s a blueprint for high-adrenaline cinema. While the plot does, somewhat conventionally, come down to a couple of bombs needing to be defused, it’s how the film gets us there that counts. Factor in much-needed comic relief from Pegg and some sheer nuttiness from Sean Harris as the prophet-like terrorist mastermind, and Mission: Impossible – Fallout is a gargantuan blockbuster, the best movie so far this the summer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018",The problem here lies in a script full of head-scratching plot points that depends on an audience not overthinking it.,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," In “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” the sixth installment of the espionage-action franchise, Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt receives his latest instructions by way of an old-fashioned tape recorder nestled inside an edition of Homer’s Odyssey. It’s a quaint nod to the 1960s TV show on which the Mission: Impossible movies are based — movies that have become so expansively scaled, preposterously plotted and implausibly choreographed that they merit renaming. Presumably, “Mission: Irrational,” “Mission: Did He Really Just Do That?” and “Mission: Okay Now You’re Just Messing With Us On Purpose” were taken. Let it be stipulated that “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is often ridiculous. It’s too long by at least 20 minutes. The plot is laughably convoluted; the action — propulsive, percussive, brutally pulverizing — is exhausting. These are mere cavils, which reminds me of another minus (see below). Still, even its most irritating parts don’t fatally damage a whole that works amazingly well, despite its own excesses. It’s an efficient, attractive delivery system for the kind of spectacle we’ve come to expect from midcareer Cruise, who famously insists on doing his own stunts and most likely has a motorcycle chase permanently written into every contract. The fact that the one in “Fallout” occurs on Paris streets that are suspiciously unclogged is characteristic of the world Ethan Hunt occupies: a superhero universe that isn’t exactly mythical, but can still only be described as reality-adjacent. As “Fallout” opens, Ethan is marking time in Dublin, waiting for his next assignment from the Impossible Mission Force and fighting the guilt that’s been troubling him since his separation from his wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan). But the brooding thoughts are banished soon enough, when Ethan is tasked with tracking down some errant plutonium, and bringing to heel his arch-nemesis Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the leader of a freelance terrorist network. It would all be easy-peasy if it weren’t for Ethan’s pesky moral conscience, which leads him to lose said plutonium, an error that leads Angela Bassett’s gimlet-eyed CIA chief to assign Ethan a minder, a ramrod-straight operative named Walker. Portrayed by Henry Cavill in a handsomely wooden performance, the mustachioed, perfectly tousled Walker makes an amusing foil both for Ethan’s competitive instincts and his altruism, which in the first hour of “Fallout” are played for laughs, but also thrills in the form of a daring midair parachute rescue. But that bit of business soon pales as bloody gun battles, car chases, a rooftop foot race, a helicopter chicken-fight and a literal cliffhanger ensue, all accompanied by bass-heavy “womps” that sound like outtakes from “Inception” at its most deafening. The stunts, staged with vigor and a sharp eye for spatial balance by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, grow wilder as “Fallout” goes on. And, admittedly, they’re a hoot. But, as with all the M:I movies, the heart of the film lies with Cruise, who at 56 refuses to obey the laws of aging, logic or simple gravity. With just a bit of facial pouchiness suggesting he’s not hiding a portrait in an attic somewhere, he exhibits the same all-out commitment in “Fallout” that he does in every film he’s in, whether it’s a slick blockbuster or idiosyncratic semi-indie (check out “American Made” sometime). As a superspy with an irritating messiah complex, Cruise brings a work ethic as solid as the movie’s narrative ethic is hectic, generously and subtly conducting an outstanding supporting cast that includes M:I veterans Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. Some of “Fallout’s” most delicious scenes, though, feature Cruise and Vanessa Kirby, leaving behind her Princess Margaret persona from “The Crown” to play a fascinatingly saucy minx of indistinct motivation. What makes “Mission: Impossible” beloved — and what has allowed it to supplant the James Bond brand as a destination for action-with-a-little-fun — is its playfulness; there are at least two amusing set pieces of misdirection that give “Fallout” extra fizz, even if they’re as clunkily obvious as who the real villain is. Set against some magnificent locales in Paris, London and Kashmir, this is a great-looking example of Hollywood cheese at its most voluptuous and toothsome. Yes, “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is big, brash and completely nonsensical. But, as someone once sang, that’s entertainment.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2018"," Here, Cruise leaps, parkour-like, across London rooftops. He jumps out of a plane at 25,000 feet. He pilots a helicopter through the mountains. When the 57-year-old Roger Moore starred in “A View to a Kill,” he spent most of that movie in front of a green screen pretending to snowboard. The actor’s complete willingness to treat his body like a crash-test dummy is part of what makes “Mission: Impossible” the best ongoing action series out there. The other is its simple, high-stakes setups. Hunt’s mission, which he chooses to accept, is to recover three plutonium cores for sale on the black market. The IMF, his intelligence agency, has learned they’ll be used by a boneheaded scientist to build weapons to forge a new world order. “The greater the suffering, the greater the peace,” the madman says in his wacko manifesto. Hunt’s geek squad (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) tracks the plutonium to Paris, where it’s to be sold by a broker called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby). Also around is cranky Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA operative sent along by an agency head (Angela Bassett) who has little faith in Hunt’s abilities. Spies have office politics too! The access the filmmakers get to certain international locations is jaw-dropping. There is a destructive motorcycle chase through Paris that passes through the Champs-Élysées and around the Arc de Triomphe. Later, Hunt runs on foot through St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. Less glam is a helicopter chase through Kashmir, but it’s the film’s most gripping sequence. Beyond the action, which makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe look cute, the thrills of “Fallout” come from its double-crosses and sinister motives. While some characters are blatantly treasonous jerks, there are a few genuinely shocking revelations. It’s Cruise’s performance that makes those moments land. Although physically formidable, the guy’s character is naive. He believes in the world at its best, even though he sees its worst. So, whenever Hunt’s betrayed, he acts like a little boy who thought he was going to the pool only to discover he’s actually on the way to the dentist. Writer and director Christopher McQuarrie borrows just the right amount of familiar spy tropes in his second “M:I” outing, and his film, while intelligent and witty, never becomes too self-serious or chatty. It’s the best night out at the movies so far this summer. Still, the “Mission: Impossible” franchise would be nothing without Cruise. While younger, more generic action stars pop up every year in paint-by-numbers, explosion-heavy drudgery, it’s Cruise who remains top gun.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018",One of the best action films to come along in years.,POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," The job of a good franchise movie is to bring us exactly what we expect, and then some. Last week, for example, “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” brought us a boatload of ABBA songs, plus Cher (an extremely on-point move, though you wonder who they’re going to trot out for the third one). “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” a movie so coolly badass it even has Angela Bassett in it, offers stunts, and more stunts, and ohmygoddidhereallyjustdothat stunts — so much so that by the end I wished Tom Cruise’s insurance company would come out and take a bow. (As should the many, many reckless souls of this film’s stunt department. Thrillmakers, all of them.) Director Christopher McQuarrie, who made lively fun from the previous “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” returns for “Fallout,” and he makes two-and-a-half hours zip by like Cruise on a motorcycle. The plot, which doesn’t matter in the slightest, involves the usual “M: I” drill: Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his Impossible Missions Force team face crisis after a mission gone wrong. The usual faces — agents Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) — are joined by recent additions such as slinky spy Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and smooth-voiced former CIA director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), and brand-new faces including Bassett’s CIA director Erika Sloane, malevolent-looking CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) and an elegant arms dealer known as the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, of “The Crown”). There’s also a familiar villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) from “Rogue Nation,” and a haunting face from Ethan’s past (whose identity, if you haven’t yet heard it, is best kept a surprise). It’s a pretty terrific ensemble, which has always been a strength of the “M: I” movies (remember Kristin Scott Thomas and Vanessa Redgrave in the first film, and Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third?) — this franchise works so well because you’re not just waiting for the next stunt, but engaged with the characters. But oh, those stunts. Enhanced by an elegant sound design (sometimes, you only hear the sound of engines whirring), each is breathtaking; there isn’t one key action sequence, but a series of them, set in dazzling international locations. In Paris, we zoom on Ethan’s motorcycle around the Arc de Triomphe, ride in a BMW down a too-tight street and a flight of stairs; and parachute with him onto the rooftop of the Grand Palais (with, but of course, an elegant outfit on under his jumpsuit). In New Zealand, he’s dangling from a helicopter; in London, he races across rooftops; and in a sequence near the end that I’m quite sure caused me to stop breathing, he hangs from a rocky crag on an imposing mountain, a drop of certain death beneath him. All this, plus Lalo Schifrin’s trademark theme music (guaranteed to get your pulse racing), Jeffrey Kurland’s delicious costumes (I particularly liked the White Widow’s spider brooch), Eddie Hamilton’s taut editing and even a few laughs. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is definitely everything we expected, and more. You might need to go lie down afterward, in a good way. ★★★½ “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” with Tom Cruise, Henry Cavill, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Angela Bassett, Vanessa Kirby, Michelle Monaghan, Alec Baldwin, Wes Bentley, Frederick Schmidt. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, from a screenplay by McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman. 147 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action, and for brief strong language. Opens July 27 at multiple theaters.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2018"," Movies have come a long way since an audience for “The Great Train Robbery” ducked under the seats as the railroad train headed toward them in that historic six-minute film screened in 1903.  Just imagine what the audience, perhaps seeing their first film at the turn of the 20th century, would think if they saw “Mission: Impossible—Fallout”! They wouldn’t be ducking under their seats. They would be shouting and running for the exits, thinking that the end of the world was finally here.  If they stayed for most of the almost two and one-half picture, though, they would not think the world was ending. They would be certain, because the bad guys, who include August Walker (Henry Cavill) as a rogue agent actually tasked with eliminating the good guys, and especially Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), an anarchist with, of course, a full beard, plan to blow up a good part of the world knocking out 1/3 of our population to start. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, in his métier having directed “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back” in 2016 (a homicide inspector looks into the case of a sniper who shot five random victims) and is the only one who directed two “Mission Impossible” actions.  At the screening I attended he spoke to the vast audience at AMC Lincoln Square’s IMAX theater, making sure that we all appreciate that Tom Cruise, who does some of his own stunts, injured his ankle during a drop from one roof to another in London, yet without waiting for his foot completely to heal continued to show up for work.  (Work?  This is pure fun.  We all should have jobs like his.) Other stunts involves jumping from roof toe roof, climbing and hanging on to a rope which Hunt holds onto for dear life as a helicopter takes off,.  All comes to a smashing conclusion in Kashmir (filmed in Norway and New Zealand) as the team of good guys try to defuse a series of bombs set to go off in 15 minutes thereby destroying most of India, Pakistan, Kashmir and presumably the happiest country, Bhutan. Each episode tops the one before, the movie owning nothing to the James Bond series since every gadget owned by 007 has been largely surpassed by today’s technology.  So: plot is familiar, action is incredible.  The picture deserves to be seen in 2-D on the largest screen available in your area, IMAX if you can get it, but given the length of the film and the annoyance of wearing those pesky glasses I would recommend skipping the 3-D.

"Jul 24, 2018"," The Mission: Impossible movies have become something akin to mid-tier Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals. All it takes are a few stunning dance sequences to elevate a film that might otherwise be marked by thin characterization or perfunctory plot. For the record, Fred and Ginger also managed a straight-out masterpiece with Swing Time. While some are hailing Mission: Impossible — Fallout as something truly special, I wouldn’t go quite that far. It does, however, offer as many thrilling dance numbers—I mean, action sequences—as any of the other installments. These include a stomach-churning parachuting scene, a bathroom fight that plays like three bulls in a china shop, and a climactic chase in which Tom Cruise scales a rope and breathtakingly shimmies onto the landing gear of a flying helicopter. (Watching it, you’ll wonder if you can ever respect CGI-assisted stunt work again.) Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie returns from the very good Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation, and while he’s brought Rebecca Ferguson back with him, her part is a bit too hapless this time around. An entirely new foil arrives in the form of Henry Cavill (Superman to those of you who have braved the recent run of DC films). As a shady CIA operative, Cavill is a slab of granite in the dialogue scenes; Cruise’s quips bounce off him with hardly a hint of recognition. But he’s perfect as an action figure—an immovable object against which Cruise can project his unstoppable force. A final showdown between them appropriately takes place against a rocky cliff, and it’s exactly Cruise’s use of perpetual motion that ultimately prevails over Cavill’s stolid strength. Personally, the comic strains of Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg have worn out their welcome (like Fred and Ginger, it might be time for Cruise to shake up the supporting cast). But I’m still a sucker for the soundtrack’s sly variations on Lalo Schifrin’s original Mission: Impossible theme (this time, the interpreter is composer Lorne Balfe). Tweaked just enough for the needs of certain scenes, such musical riffing is one of the movie’s minor delights. So far, I haven’t tired of watching Tom Cruise dance to it. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," You can always count on the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise to deliver much-needed thrills during the summer movie season. It helps that Tom Cruise, playing IMF agent Ethan Hunt, does his own stunts, which brings an authentic feel to the set pieces that most summer blockbusters would lack due to overreliance with CGI. ""Ghost Protocol"" had Tom Cruise hanging on for dear life on the Burj Khalifa skyscraper. In ""Rogue Nation,"" the Vienna State Opera House sequence, a blend of nastily rendered Hitchcockian suspense, stunned us with its risk-taking acrobatics.   Stunts, stunts, stunts, and more stunts. That's how the series has been reinvented for the 21st century. These last three films are very much their own breed, a trilogy of action moviemaking that represents peak after peak of stunning practical effects. I dread even explaining the overly complicated plot for this latest endeavor because, well, it's really just an excuse for Tom Cruise to showcase his fearless acrobatics. At 56, Cruise is back as IMF undercover agent Ethan Hunt – and what he does here is a damn-near franchise peak of physical prowess. Hell, production of ""Fallout"" even had to be suspended after Cruise broke his ankle on a failed stunt. That's practical effects for you. Barely any computers, or CGI were used in the making of this summer blockbuster. A cause for celebration? More like a damn-near miracle. Directed by Christopher McQuarrie, ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" is the sixth film of the series, and, quite possibly, the best. Maybe only rivaled by Brad Bird's miraculous “Ghost Protocol"" from 2015. Nah, you know what, I think we have a new champ in the series. ""Fallout"" is THAT good. My advice is to forget about McQuarrie’s script, which is filled with plot twist after plot twist and just revel in the action. Just know that three spheres of plutonium are missing, if they get into the hands of baddie John Lark then the world is toast. Isn't that what's at stake in most of these films?  Lark believes that only real suffering can rebuild a new world order and bring lasting peace. Lark is quickly revealed as a pawn for psychopath Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the villain from ""Rogue Nation."" Hunt’s IMF boss (Alec Baldwin) and the head of the CIA (Angela Bassett) want Solomon captured immediately. All of this as Rebecca Ferguson’s mysterious Ilsa Faust, Hunt's old flame, lurks around, like an assassin waiting for the kill. Should she be trusted? At least Hunt has his old crew back, Benji (comedic relief courtesy of Simon Pegg) and bomb specialist Luther (Ving Rhames in a more expanded role than usual) are back for the cause. However, trouble comes in the form of Henry Cavill's CIA agent Walker, who is tasked by Bassett's CIA chief to watch over Hunt and make sure he stays with the game plan, especially when the crew has to meet Vanessa Kirby's White Widow, a lethal and dangerous middle-woman.  Got that? Probably not. Who cares, right?  The film, a thorough blast of suspense and action, tries to cram in as much as possible. Cruise, one of the last true movie stars left, gives it his all here. It's as if he and McQuarrie went for broke with this film because, well, Cruise isn't getting any younger and will be close to 60 if another movie does happen in the near future.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," I deliberately didn’t watch a single one of the Mission: Impossible movies before seeing Fallout, the sixth movie in the Tom Cruise franchise, partially because I didn’t want to start playing that game of comparing and ranking the movies. The latest and hopefully not last (although this one will be hard to top) has taken the ‘60s television show to the point where each movie could be taken as an episode on a show, each with their own director, tone and look. Long-time Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie took over the reins for 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, and maybe he bit off more than he could chew, because I was not a fan of it at all. (In fact, you can still read my review of that movie, if you so choose.) To avoid spoilers, I’m going to tell you about the story in the simplest and least detailed way possible, but this is essentially a direct sequel to the 2015 movie taking place two years later. Although Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and the IMF have stopped Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and his Syndicate of world spies, a new enemy presents itself in the mysterious John Lang and his Apostles, a splinter group that’s going to take Lane’s plans even further by detonating three nuclear bombs in key locales. To stop them, Ethan, Benjie (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) must stop the sale of a large quantity of Plutonium and basically take it off the market. Their mission fails and the Plutonium is stolen, but it turns back up when a broker known as White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) makes plans to sell it to Lang in a rendezvous in Paris. Except the CIA isn’t going to let the IMF screw up again, and CIA head Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) sends her agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) along to keep Hunt in line. Got all that? Well, enjoy it because by an hour and a half into a movie, everything you thought you knew about where everyone stands is going to be turned on its head in one of the dizzying series of twists that constantly leaves you wondering if anything you’re watching is real or false. One of my biggest complaints with Rogue Nation was that I felt it was far too derivative of other spy action-thrillers and maybe it didn’t help that it was literally the fourth or fifth spy movie of that year. I also was perplexed by the amount of exposition that it ended up bogging down the film’s pace. Fallout doesn’t have that problem, because it’s almost as if McQuarrie decided to leave all the exposition for the opening and then let the action do the rest.  Again, I can’t go into too much further detail about why the story works so much better, but much of it comes down to the tapestry of twists that McQuarrie weaves together, so that every time you think you’ve figured out the magic trick, he pulls the rug from under you. This isn’t just about Ethan Hunt going rogue again either – don’t worry, he does – but it also introduces the idea of the CIA and MI6 having to work for and sometimes against the IMF in order to stay one-up on the bad guys. This last bit is what contributes most to a twisty movie that requires you to pay attention similar to an intricate science fiction film. McQuarrie has always been a great writer, but I think he found a better mix of humor and tension in this one than he did with the previous film. I’ve always liked Cruise as Ethan Hunt and with six movies under his belt, he’s really gotten so comfortable with the character that it’s not just Tom Cruise being Tom Cruise… or else maybe we’ve seen him play Hunt so much that we’ve forgotten what the real Tom Cruise looks/sounds like when not playing him? Pegg and Rhames as his IMF partners continue to bring smiles and laughs, and even Alec Baldwin seems to be bringing something new to his character introduced in the last movie. Henry Cavill also brings a lot to the mix as CIA agent Walker, who is introduced as the hammer to Hunt’s scalpel, something that’s hard to believe if you remember some of the violent action from the previous movie. Rebecca Ferguson also returns as MI5 agent Ilsa Faust, who is once again every bit the match for Hunt in terms of getting physical both in the fight sequences and on a motorbike in the film’s big chase through Paris.  Sean Harris is much better as Solomon Lane in this one, maybe because he’s far more vulnerable, spending much of his time in custody ala Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.  The nicest surprise for me though has to be Vanessa Kirby as the White Widow, as she has some wonderful moments with Cruise that could make her a great recurring character for the series. (And I really, really, really must watch The Crown soon, considering how much I liked her in this and Claire Foy in Soderbergh’s Unsane earlier this year.)You also don’t need to see Ferguson and Michelle Monaghan on screen together to realize that Hunt definitely has a type. So basically, McQuarrie has taken the already enjoyable cast and added Kirby, Cavill and Bassett, who all bring their A-game to help sell the raised stakes and the situations in this movie. This is the very reason why you go to watch these movies, at least going back to the second movie when director John Woo pushed the envelope from Brian De Palma’s original, and Cruise and McQuarrie have really upped the ante this time around. Sure, there’s a car chase through Paris, but that’s unlike any of the car chases we’ve seen before. Same with Tom Cruise’s obligatory running sequence. The skydiving sequence ups the ante from Cruise hanging onto a plane in the last movie, and it’s even more amazing when you realize what Cruise went through to be able to do it all in one shot. (McQuarrie introduced my screening and explained what Cruise went through in terms of training to fly an Airbus, how he broke his ankle before the running scene and what was involved with filming the skydiving scene, which just made all of the action that much more impressive.) I highly recommend seeing Fallout in IMAX or the biggest screen possible because McQuarrie and his DP really take advantage of the larger settings, whether it’s Paris or London or the mountain location of the final climax which also ups the ante on Cruise’s mountain-climbing bit in Mission: Impossible II and the skyscraper climb in Ghost Protocol.  Let’s just say that if you’ve liked the franchise before, Fallout won’t disappoint. In fact, it might impress you by how far the stakes have been raised both in the action scenes and the suspense, as well as the twists and turns that make this the Inception of the franchise, if you remember how intricate and complex an action movie that was.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," The sixth outing for IMF (that’s the Impossible Missions Force, of course) agent Ethan Hunt and his team, this is not only the best Mission: Impossible movie of the series so far, but also one of the best action movies of the decade. While we have come to expect Tom Cruise (as Hunt) to hang off buildings, planes and cliffs, race cars and bikes through streets, battle bad guys and scurry across rooftops for this franchise, in this movie he does all of that and more, with his most impressive feat being the ability to grab the audience so tightly you can’t breathe and not let go for two and a half hours. After an IMF mission goes wrong, Ethan and his team (including Rhames’ Luther and Pegg’s Benji) are facing a nuclear threat that involves Rogue Nation’s baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). To complicate matters, CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) insists to Ethan’s boss Hunley (Alec Baldwin) that a mission can only go ahead if one of her men – August Walker (Cavill) – goes along, and while they are bashing heads and hunting bad guys they also cross paths with former MI6 agent Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) who has her own agenda. Wittily written and extremely clever, this works on every level. There’s humour, plot twists, and terrific performances from the star-heavy, perfectly chosen cast. Everyone gives it their all, and none more than Cruise himself (you’ll be able to spot the roof-leaping scene in which he broke his ankle in real life… and carried on filming) who often looks believably battered, beaten, bruised and completely knackered as he tries to save the day. Thanks to Christopher McQuarrie’s tight, heart-thumping direction, this quickly shakes off a slow start and builds to an almost frantic pace as eye-widening set piece follows set piece. There’s a stunning Paris car chase, an edge of the seat helicopter battle, Tom’s athletic London rooftop antics and even an impressive fight in a men’s nightclub toilet, plus Cruise’s HALO jump scene from a plane (that you can watch here). It’s breathtaking stuff that not only demands a second viewing (and a follow up) but also confirms Tom Cruise as the true Hollywood action star that he deserves to be. As with the previous Mission: Impossible movies, there are numerous tense scenes involving fist fights, shoot outs, and car chases but little time is spent dwelling on the bloodshed.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," “Know when you’re beat.” This advice to Tom Cruise’s superspy character Ethan Hunt goes unheeded (of course) in Mission: Impossible—Fallout, the sixth in a series of action extravaganzas based on the 1960s TV show. Hunt’s can-do spirit in the face of seemingly impossible odds becomes a prominent motif this time out, his improvisations—and those of the team he leads by example—underscored by lines like “I’ll figure it out” and “I’m working on it.” It’s also part of the design by writer-director Christopher McQuarrie to let Mission: Impossible be Mission: Impossible in an old-school sense, with elaborate long cons perpetrated on clueless bad guys (with the occasional wrench in the works) and, in the new-school sense, with bad guys pulling the rug out from under our heroes. Fallout proves deliberately dizzying, not just with its oft-vertiginous action, but in its outrageous plotting, its deliriously absurd entanglements of double agents, double crosses, and just plain doubles (wearing those masks that, this time, earn the Impossible Missions Force a derisive comparison to Halloween). Because those twists drive the picture, it wouldn’t be fair to spoil them. Suffice it to say that McQuarrie also wrote and directed the previous entry, Mission: Impossible—Rogue Nation, and Fallout follows directly from it, retaining most of that film’s key characters, including Rebecca Ferguson’s British spy Ilsa Faust, Sean Harris’ anarchist antagonist Solomon Lane, and Alec Baldwin’s IMF boss-man Alan Hunley. This unusual continuity underscores the happy oddity of McQuarrie being the only director to return to the job; previously, a new helmer put his stamp on the franchise every time, from Brian De Palma to Brad Bird. (While unnecessary, a knowledge of the previous films, going all the way back to the first, enhances the experience of Fallout.) McQuarrie and Cruise are obviously simpatico in planning and executing these giant-scale action films, which finally cracked the code of the hugely successful James Bond franchise. Hunt is the American Bond, a little more cocky than cool, a little more flappable than not. Fallout considers, once again, the risks and the costs of what Hunt does, but it also lionizes him as a man who cares as much about one life as about hundreds of millions. Like Star Trek’s Captain James T. Kirk, Hunt recklessly refuses to believe in the no-win scenario, which makes him just the man to accept “impossible” missions—while also serving as a more appealing hero than those who kill first, ask questions later. A la the Bond films, Fallout travels the world, maximizing fabulous locations (this is a production with the clout to shut down major thoroughfares in Paris) and staging astonishing stunt sequences: hand-to-hand pummelings, shootouts, vehicular mayhem, and the sky-high thrills that literalize the title. Franchises this big swiftly become their own worst enemy as they scratch holes in their proverbial heads trying to figure out how to top what's come before. McQuarrie gives it all he's got, and he has enough talent (and, perhaps more importantly, budget) behind him to get audiences to swallow scenarios that are, at their core, as familiar as our first cup of coffee in the morning: the cliffhanger, the car chase, the bathroom brawl, the ticking-time-bomb climax. Seen-it-all audiences will still marvel at the clever staging, the startlingly effective execution. The whole cast commits (from core team members Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames to newcomers Henry Cavill, Vanessa Kirby, and Angela Bassett), but none more so than Cruise, worth every penny he earns as star and producer in his audience-pleasing instincts and his willingness to push his body to its limits. It’s anyone’s guess if Cruise himself will know when he’s beat, but when he’s truly in the driver’s seat, we’re in no hurry to find out.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," Six “Mission: Impossible” movies in, Tom Cruise’s various globe-trotting, death-defying antics – hanging from a helicopter in Kashmir, sprinting across the tops of buildings in Paris – seem like missions pretty possible. What’s more impossible about ""Mission: Impossible – Fallout"" (★★★ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters nationwide Friday), and what gives the franchise more depth than the usual nonstop action of similar fare, are the moral quandaries faced by secret agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his crew. They have to wrestle with what is the greater good and whether  a friend’s safety is worth potential nuclear annihilation.  The rare direct sequel (at least in this series) to 2015’s “Rogue Nation,” “Fallout” brings back the bad-guy Syndicate but with a more extremist terrorist splinter group that wants to nab three spheres of plutonium, ostensibly bringing the world to its knees. Ethan and his core IMF (Impossible Mission Force) team – cool hack master Luther (Ving Rhames) and high-strung tech specialist Benji (Simon Pegg) – are tasked with getting the plutonium themselves, but when Ethan literally takes his eyes off the ball to help a pal, the villains run off with radioactive treasure. The CIA has some serious trust issues with the IMF, so they send in mustached brute August Walker (Henry Cavill) to join the team as Ethan goes undercover to recover the nuclear material and figure out the big bad at the center of it all. Ethan wheels and deals with a black-market arms dealer named the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), former MI6 operative/love interest Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) gets embroiled in the affair, and there’s also a return appearance by “Rogue Nation” antagonist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). While the movie on the whole isn’t quite the caliber of the last two missions (“Ghost Protocol” and “Rogue Nation”), director Christopher McQuarrie’s action-packed “Fallout” set pieces are outstanding, finding great character moments in the middle of the explosiveness. Two early situations with Ethan and Walker, from a machismo-laden parachute jump into a French nightclub to a wall-breaking row in the men’s bathroom, do wonders to evolve the relationship between two frenemies. Double- and triple-crosses convolute the spy narrative, and Ethan’s ex Julia (Michelle Monaghan) returns under all-too-convenient circumstances. Otherwise, McQuarrie’s female contingent is top notch: Angela Bassett’s CIA chief Erika Sloane is an enjoyably shifty sort, Kirby’s White Widow is a femme fatale with a great look and not nearly enough screen time, and Ilsa remains a hypnotic, leather-clad cross between Boba Fett and Wonder Woman who's arguably the best character in the franchise.  Not that Cruise doesn’t own these movies. Akin to a human rubber ball, the A-lister runs like the wind, careens off walls, takes many spills but bounces back to do some other crazy thing most 56-year-olds would balk at. What’s interesting in “Fallout” is the good-hearted grounding he gives Ethan. There are no innocent casualties if he can help it, and there's real moral consideration behind every rogue act and deadly encounter.  With its combination of spycraft, intrigue and insane physicality, “Fallout” again proves “Mission: Impossible” is the gold standard for international action-adventure and that Cruise is this generation's James Bond. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," To some, Tom Cruise is a god, and really, these Mission: Impossible movies only add fuel to that fire. For over 20 years, and through six straight films, the would-be Messiah of Scientology has defied all sorts of logic and science. He’s conquered canyons, scaled the world’s tallest buildings, become a temporary mermaid, redefined the way one collects SkyMiles, flung himself out of every vehicle imaginable, and sprinted through cities without a single pair of Nikes. In Mission: Impossible – Fallout, he literally falls from space down to Earth, a visual metaphor that is hardly coincidental, because if there’s one takeaway to be had from this chapter in the franchise, it’s that Cruise, or rather Ethan Hunt, is human after all. Kind of. For the first time ever, it feels like Hunt doesn’t have all the answers, namely because he admits he doesn’t. “I’ll figure it out,” he says multiple times to his bewildered colleagues, which, for this mission, includes Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benjamin “Benji” Dunn (Simon Pegg), Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), and Kryptonian CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill). Granted, it’s an admission that’s mostly played for laughs — and one that will certainly have cinephiles recalling Lucasfilm’s most popular archaeologist — but it also speaks to the existential dilemma that this series has instilled in Hunt since J.J. Abrams’ recalibration of the franchise: 2006’s Mission: Impossible III. If you recall, it was that film which added real-world stakes to Hunt’s globetrotting, instilling some sense of mortality in the guy with the loss of his protege Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) and hinting at a future outside of the IMF with his engagement to Julia Meade (Michelle Monaghan). By the end, the film suggested he might not need the spy life, that he could be something more than a man on a wire, and while that clearly didn’t pan out, the arc at least proved that Hunt is more than just impossible stunts. Of course, “impossible stunts” are exactly what the series capitalized on with its two followups — 2011’s Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol and 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation — but not without that beating heart. In some ways, the Mission: Impossible franchise has paralleled the trajectory of Universal’s Fast and Furious brand, capitalizing on ridiculous action that’s made possible by its charming ensemble chemistry. Looking back, it’s actually kind of funny: Whereas Brian De Palma brazenly killed off his on-screen team (technically twice) in the 1996 original, Abrams and his Bad Robot boys have exhaustively spent four films building their team and keeping them alive — and it’s worked wonders. Because unlike Daniel Craig’s remorseless interpretation of James Bond, which has become needlessly maudlin over the past three entries, Mission: Impossible knows exactly what it needs to be: a fun and chummy thrill ride that’s always self-aware. Fallout follows that agenda, while also revisiting its more severe roots. It’s a sequel in every sense of the word, reintroducing not only familiar faces, but styles, themes, and motifs of past films. There’s the complex narratives of De Palma’s first installment, the boisterous machismo of John Woo’s second, the sentimentality of Abrams’ third, and the breakneck speed of Brad Bird’s fourth. Once again, director Christopher McQuarrie, who breaks tradition by becoming the first director in the franchise to helm two films, adds a humorous wash to the proceedings. Unlike Rogue Nation, however, there’s this palpable notion that everyone’s feeling their stuff, particularly Hunt, who hardly gets through a single mission without limping away. But that’s what makes Fallout so compelling … and also incredibly honest. Let’s not forget, Cruise is 56 years old, which is five years older than Wilford Brimley was in Cocoo — oh whatever, you’ve seen the goddamn meme. In the past, that was something this series could easily ignore, especially when Cruise started defying everyone’s expectations (including Paramount’s) by doing every imaginable stunt, but it’s also something this series was always going to have to contend with at some point in time. What Fallout does is acknowledge that age, while also suggesting it’s mostly bullshit, ultimately conceding that these middle-aged heroes are in for the ride so long as the ride will have them — and it will. For how long, though, is hard to say. Seeing how Cruise suffered a major injury on this film, stalling production for an extended period of time, it won’t be long before the studio (and any self-respecting insurance company) finally puts the kibosh on his real-life heroics. Even worse, it won’t be long before Hunt not only sounds like Indiana Jones, but starts looking like him too, as in Kingdom of the Crystal Skull-era Dr. Jones, at which point the joke really won’t be funny anymore. Rest assured, we’re a ways off from that point, but that narrative is certainly set in motion, and it’s admittedly comforting. With Hunt being more fallible, the stakes are richly nuanced, making the missions that much more intriguing. Now, there’s a scrappiness to his actions that’s supremely human, even if what he’s doing is still out of this world. The conclusion, for instance, is as boisterous and insane as the series gets, though it feels grounded because Hunt is clearly jerry-rigging his way through the situation. That’s a recurring element in Fallout, and one that’s rather paramount to the film’s overall tension. Not only does it considerably elevate each action sequence, but it also adds weight to the series’ ensuing supporting cast. We saw this last time around with Ferguson’s athletic Faust, and we see it once again here with Cavill’s seemingly imperfect Walker, whose wide frame and skyscraper height dwarfs Hunt to hilarious results. Even so, Hunt always finds a way to come out on top, and to its credit, Fallout acknowledges this, leaning hard on Hallmark-esque monologues that do some heavy lifting to emphasize the guy’s slavish dedication to the job, the sacrifices he’s made over the years, and his enduring track record. They’re a tad treacly, but they also fit the film’s balmy themes of commitment and teamwork, the likes of which fall in line with everything Abrams drilled into the series 12 years ago. Having said that, they also feel like spiritual statements for Cruise, whose messianic image should only be further embellished by these eternally gratifying moments, especially when they’re being beamed off screen through omniscient voiceovers. Some may scoff, some may roll their eyes, but some may actually tear up. Like last year’s Logan with Hugh Jackman, it’s very rare to see a hero who’s lived this long on screen, and there’s something to be said about seeing Cruise front and center after all this time. These are strange days in Hollywood, an era when stars are riding shotgun to IP, but here’s the thing: Cruise is the brand. Without him, Mission: Impossible is any other spy series, which explains why both Jeremy Renner’s William Brandt and Ferguson’s Faust have both remained sidekicks. Say what you will about the guy — hell, call him Xenu even — but these missions would cease to exist if he didn’t accept them. The only question now is whether he wants to do more.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2018"," “There cannot be peace without first a great suffering.” Rogue MI6 agent and returning harbinger of death Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) has a message for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), one that resonates beyond its immediate narrative context. It could be that this grandiose doomsday prophecy is a sly allusion to the current state of Western politics. But no. Far more pertinently, this line rings true in relation to the recent fortunes of the man who has been at the centre of the Mission: Impossible franchise since its inception over 20 years ago. That Tom Cruise – 56 at the time of writing – is still able to open a $150m summer blockbuster is testament to his remarkable durability as a modern Hollywood icon. Yet it’s fair to say that mid-career Cruise has so far been characterised more by misses than hits – while both Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol were considerable box office successes, attempts by studios and filmmakers alike to replicate their winning formula (cf Jack Reacher, The Mummy) have blotted the actor’s copybook to varying degrees. Cruise has always seemed undeterred by this, reassuringly steadfast in his willingness to push himself to the limit again and again for the sake of his art (not to mention a hefty pay cheque). Increasingly, however, his tireless running, running, running has started to resemble something other than a means to an end, almost as though he’s caught in a holding pattern of high-energy stasis. This is the essential fallacy of Cruiseness: that moving very quickly, in all manner of ways and in every conceivable direction, is a mark of progression. All of which is a roundabout way of explaining that Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an absolutely top-drawer action flick – perhaps not quite on a par with Brian De Palma’s 1996 original, but comfortably the best addition to the franchise to date. This is a rare bird in contemporary blockbuster cinema, a star vehicle that adds up to more than the sum of its high-gloss, precision-tooled parts. Where the franchise has tended to lean too heavily on Cruise in the past, the sixth instalment feels like a genuine team effort. Once again the IMF’s top odds-thwarting field agent thrusts himself into the heart of the action with trademark devil-may-care swagger, but his associates Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) get stuck in too, using their various specialist skills to Hunt’s best advantage. Yes, the gang is well and truly back together, and crucially everyone makes a valuable contribution to the cause. New to the series but no less important is Henry Cavill’s covert CIA operative August Walker, whose thick, immaculately-groomed moustache adds a layer of ambiguity and masculinity that makes him the perfect foil for Cruise/Hunt. It’s a small but vital character detail, a cunning subversion of the Superman actor’s clean-cut image. You may recall that this seemingly innocuous piece of facial foliage was a point of fierce contention in movieland last year. Well, even Justice League’s beleaguered VFX team would be hard-pressed to deny that it was worth all the fuzz. The mission itself is relatively straightforward: intercept arms deal; recover stolen plutonium; avert nuclear crisis. Lane’s shady international crime network, known as The Syndicate, have other plans though, and so Hunt and co soon find themselves hot-footing it around Paris and London, nimbly dodging bullets and red herrings while leaving a trail of their own. A rooftop sprint between Blackfriars Station and Tate Modern, which resulted in filming being put on hold for eight weeks as Cruise recovered from a fractured ankle, is particularly thrilling, as are a zig-zagging helicopter chase and a skydiving sequence for which Cruise performed a HALO (high altitude, low opening) jump at 25,000 feet. The months of preparation and meticulous stunt co-ordination that go into pulling off a set-piece like this ultimately don’t count for much (aside from the obvious publicity they generate) if the end product as a whole is sub-awesome. The Burj Khalifa bit in 2011’s Ghost Protocol, for instance, is arguably the sole standout moment in an otherwise flat and largely forgettable blockbuster. Maybe not the only scene in the entire film to set your pulse racing, but probably the only one you actually remember. This is where Fallout eclipses its predecessors. For the first time in a long time, we have a Mission: Impossible film in which story and character are prized as highly as high-wire pyrotechnics. McQuarrie has now directed three Cruise films (the first Jack Reacher, Rogue Nation, Fallout) and written a further three (Valkyrie, Edge of Tomorrow, The Mummy). Objectively speaking, that’s a pretty mixed bag, but the wider point is that sometimes achieving greatness takes more than hard work, determination and a truckload of cash. Clearly the pair have established a strong, mostly fruitful working relationship. Long may it continue. Though, if for whatever reason the franchise does end here, with Cruise sucking in a lungful of crisp glacier air after yet another last-gasp save, it will have been one heck of a send off. It’s taken two decades, five sequels and countless voided insurance policies, but Cruise’s unwavering commitment has paid off in a big way. The suffering is over now. Finally, he has found peace.

Just as Hunt and his team, including Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and technical field agent Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), make their way to Paris, CIA director Erica Sloane (Angela Bassett) has other plans.  Sloane assigns August Walker (Henry Cavill), a member of the Special Activities Division.  Waiting for them in Paris is the black market broker White Widow (Vanessa Kirby).  Also waiting in Paris is former MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).  She keeps coming to the rescue when Ethan least expects it but with her own agenda. The whole climactic third act will have audiences on the edge of their seats.  It’s up to the team to stop a pair of bombs.  It’s easier said than done and requires a team effort, including massive stunt work in the snow-capped mountains of Kashmir.  Honestly, the entire film is so fast-paced that there’s not even a great moment to sneak off to the bathroom. At times, Baldwin gives off a comedic vibe as Hunley.  Whether it’s intentional or not, there’s a little bit of Jack Donaghy in Baldwin’s performance.  Meanwhile, CNN’s Wolf Blitzer makes the best use of his cameo.  He should seriously quite while he’s ahead.

"Jul 24, 2018"," Someday, when Tom Cruise is using a walker or in a wheelchair thanks to the running, leaping motorcycle-crashing stunts he’s hurled himself into in these “Mission: Impossible” movies, you’re going to regret not giving the man his props when he was laying it all out there for your movie-going thrills. Someday, just not today. Because “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” is, right now, everything a summer action pic should be — a delirious procession of stunning stunts, epic brawls, state-of-the-art car chases and ticking clock countdowns. Throw a bunch of top drawer actors at a plot that’s as topical as the latest meltdowns in Washington, London and a world going mad and this is what you get — high tension, higher stakes, witty banter, pathos, pulse-pounding action beats and more “How in the HELL did they do THAT?” moments than you can count. It’s a robust blast of bullet-and-bloody-fisted machismo, delivered with a healthy dose of lens flare. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is summoned to retrieve missing plutonium and trade it for a nemesis (Sean Harris) he captured, but who still haunts his dreams. He and his team (Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg) dash from Paris to London and BFE Pakistan, keeping a testy CIA chief (Angela Bassett) at bay, their Impossible Mission Force boss (Alec Baldwin) on tenterhooks, an arms dealer named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) on the line and assorted Apostles — anarchists bent on global destruction — on their heels. There’s a CIA sidekick (Henry Cavill) who might be a great ally or a deadly foe, an MI6 black widow (Rebecca Ferguson) who has “history” with Hunt, and some of the tastiest action film one-liners and exchanges you will ever hear. Sure, we get lots of “I’m WORKing on it,” and “Just so I’ve got this clear,” “We’re going to have to go it alone” and “I need you to TRUST me.” Hitchcock always said “Great villains make great thrillers,” and writer-director Christopher McQuarrie of the last “Impossible” mission movie and “Jack Reacher,” found a lulu in Sean Harris. A ginger-haired staple of British films like “’71,” “24 Hour Party People” and “Harry Brown,” he makes a brooding monster of your nightmares. His Solomon Lane is a messianic fanatic, sparing with his words, hissing his apocalyptic threats and pronouncements. Hunt isn’t the only one whose dreams he’ll haunt. And Cavill, two-fisted, droll and revealing a sadistic side that his “Man of Steel” never shows, remakes his career with this turn. He’s one bad mutha-hushyourmouth. I never cease to be amazed by how consistently amazing these movies and their durable star are. Directors change, storylines bend, and yet the dazzle shows up again, every couple of years. James Bond doesn’t have an M:I batting average. McQuarrie re-connects the films with the action-packed, gadget-riddled 1960s-and-70s TV series this all came from, “Your mission, should you choose to accept it,” the works. Hell’s bells, we were going to Paris this fall, but we may have to change our plans. Tom Cruise and McQuarrie have gone and torn the place apart. And seriously, who could have guessed that Lalo Schifrin’s jazzy, Latin-flavored heart-thumping theme song would endure and delight in a movie 45 years after the TV show was canceled? “Fallout” earns its pathos from the female leads and its stakes from the sense of mortality Cruise & Co. give it. They –he — let us know they can’t keep doing this forever. But before he gets too expensive to ensure and too crippled to late-middle-age sprint as if his life — and the world — depends on him, you’d better show some love to Cruise. The man puts on an action hero clinic every time he dons Ethan Hunt’s shades of black, and you can only hope everybody else who takes a shot at the genre is taking notes.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2018"," Exactly a decade on from the monumental success of Mamma Mia!, Here We Go Again! is a sequel that is mostly prequel and one which does manage to mine the same vein of magic that appealed to so many people. And that is key, if Abba songs, singing, dancing, romance on a Greek island, no-one taking themselves seriously or needing therapy for potentially traumatising events is your thing, the sequel will delight. If it isn't, run as far as you did from the first film. A small, but necessary spoiler alert, Donna (Meryl Streep) has been dead for a year and her daughter Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is reopening Donna's taverna on Kalokairi as a tribute. The project is a mission that has caused a rift with her NY-based husband Sky (Dominic Cooper). She has a brooding Mexican manager to help (Andy Garcia) one of her three fathers, Sam (Pierce Brosnan) nearby and is expecting her mother's best friends Tanya and Rosie (Christine Baranski and Julie Walters) to the opening gala. But they're grieving and the tone of the present is a little more melancholy than that of the past, laid out during the long flashbacks to how Donna first got to Kalokairi. Lily James plays young Donna with an ebullience I seem to be alone in finding annoying (it also irked me that her eyes, like those of the young Rosie, are the wrong colour for their adult selves, so maybe it was just a cranky day). The Abba men sneak in, the original cast reappears and is bolstered most notably by Queen Cher who makes the most of her late arrival. Technically better than the first film, it's light, camp, musical fun with, hanky alert, a final scene that packs a surprisingly emotional punch. Stay for the finale. If incredibly choreographed and shot action scenes, ridiculous gadgets and solutions, and lots of running aren't your thing, it's not for you, but if they are this will make you very happy. Christopher McQuarrie once again delivers a platinum action blockbuster, with huge energy and momentum throughout and a fabulous third act. With so much action the plot is almost irrelevant but Cruise (who is 56, and deserves an Oscar just for his running) delivers Ethan Hunt as always. He is rejoined by Rebecca Ferguson, Simon Pegg and Vick Rhames, and following a failed mission they have to undo the damage and save the world. It's five years since we've seen Jodie Foster in her big screen natural habitat (the 2013 sci-fi Elysium) and for this reason - and perhaps this reason alone - Hotel Artemis is noteworthy. In Drew Pearce's noirish crime carnival, Foster is the epicentre, not only given her character's shuffling reign over the titular hotel where bad types go to get patched up, but also in the unforgettable register of her performance. She plays The Nurse, who with imposing assistant Everest (Dave Bautista) runs the mob-owned medical facility for the meanest LA criminals. Yet another dystopia rages outside. Finding themselves at the Artemis after a bank-job goes awry is Waikiki (Sterling K Brown) and his injured brother. They mingle uneasily with fellow residents Nice (Sofia Boutella) and Acapulco (Charlie Day). It would have been easy for Lauren Greenfield to serve up a freakshow of the ways developed societies worship at the altar of capitalism in the form of an addendum to her 2012 Sundance-winning doc The Queen of Versailles. Admirably, however, here the US photographer and director weaves herself into the frame in order to try to bring context to a subject that can seem to have no end. That said, much of Generation Wealth is gob-smacking (and at times stomach-turning) and will make you want to flee Planet Kardashian and grow vegetables on Inishbofin. Celebrity fetishising, Wall Street evils, eating disorders, plastic surgery addiction, porn culture and child beauty pageants are just some of the extremes Greenfield, by her own admission, uses to understand the mainstream.",POSITIVE

A las constantes de la velocidad, de la verticalidad, del desafío a la gravedad en clave de elogio a la caída libre y de la lúdica, recurrente reversibilidad de la trama, que encuentra su metonimia fotogénica en las máscaras digitales que transforman a los personajes en sus némesis, se añade la expansión hiperbólica del montaje de tramas paralelas y el juego con la dilatación del tiempo que, desde Edwin S. Porter hasta D.W. Griffith, articularon el cine de atracciones más popular de la etapa muda. En cierto modo, “Misión: Imposible – Fallout” lleva tan lejos su exploración de ese recurso que llega un momento en que la película parece olvidarse del relato, alambicado fuego cruzado entre espías, agentes dobles, terroristas y anarquistas, para abrazar un régimen múltiple de rescates, peleas, persecuciones y derrumbes simultáneos que electrifica la mirada del espectador más pasivo.   Los que piensan que la sofisticada poética del simulacro del episodio inicial es insuperable no van a cambiar de opinión. Ni siquiera los fans del capítulo dirigido por J.J. Abrams reescribirán su top 3, aunque la segunda incursión de McQuarrie en el universo de “M:I” sea un compendio monumental de excelentes secuencias de acción que remiten y amplifican otros momentos de la saga, y confirme a Ethan Hunt como hermano gemelo del Bond más trágico, un héroe moral que, en su sexta aventura, puede vanagloriarse de tener una biografía a sus espaldas, o lo que es lo mismo, de haberse ganado a pulso su dimensión serial. Al filme tal vez le falte un villano que esté a la altura de aquel perturbador Philip Seymour Hoffman, o quizás abuse demasiado de las escenas de transición para explicar con diálogos los avances del relato, pero trabaja con tino sus distintas tramas románticas -incluso cuando el deseo está envenenado de azules, como es el caso de la sexy Viuda Blanca-, demuestra que el carisma de Tom Cruise está lejos de estrellarse contra el muro de las viejas glorias, se beneficia de la estólida aparición de un Henry Cavill con más tinieblas que superpoderes, y de la extraordinaria puesta en escena, tan diáfana como cartesiana, de varias ‘set pieces’ -atención a la del Grand Palais, la de la persecución parisina y la del clímax final, con un par de helicópteros embutidos en un precipicio- que parecen reformulaciones hiperrealistas del cine-espectáculo de los setenta, alérgicas a la borrosa cámara en mano y el montaje atomizado de la saga Bourne.

"Jul 23, 2018"," The 56-year-old Tom Cruise continues to defy time and gravity. There's a batteringly physical rooftop chase in London where Cruise's Ethan Hunt has to make his way from the top of St Paul’s cathedral to the pinnacle of the tower of Tate Modern. Cruise broke his foot while filming a leap between high ledges – the shot stayed in the movie – which is perhaps why the sense of a driven man dicing with death communicates itself so vividly. As the story progresses, car chases, banzai escapades on motorbikes and an astounding helicopter duel guarantee that this is one movie even the most jaded armchair critic will find it impossible to snooze through. Plot-wise, it’s a characteristic impossible-missions spiderweb of doomsday conspiracies and confusing multiple identities, played out by characters whose true motives remain unknown until (and perhaps beyond) the final reel. However, making a comeback is the morbid villain Solomon Lane, played with funereal wheeziness by Sean Harris, cloaked behind a beard that looks as if it blew in off a nearby garbage tip. Hunt and his regular sidekicks Luther Stickell and Benji Dunn (Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg) are on the trail of some stolen plutonium with which Lane’s criminal cronies propose to perpetrate thermonuclear mayhem, in accordance with Lane’s apocalyptic thesis that only the maximum amount of suffering will drive the greatest desire for peace. Hunt’s first attempt to acquire the plutonium is scuppered when he’s forced to choose between it and Stickell’s life, which prompts some speculation about moral choice and the greater good. The theme of the personal cost of saving the world is reprised in a reappearance of Hunt’s wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), from whom he has separated to spare her from the repercussions of his ultra-hazardous career. However, the film wears such brow-furrowing concerns lightly, and lifts the mood with frequent flashes of wit both visual and verbal. Pegg’s Benji is a frequent source of obtuse, nerdish one-liners, while Alec Baldwin brings an undertone of ironic mischief to Hunt’s boss Alan Hunley. By contrast, a fight scene between Hunt, his CIA ally August Walker (Henry Cavill) and a sinister Chinaman in the gents lavatory of Paris’s Grand Palais triggers a kind of disbelieving hilarity through a berserk escalation of violence which reduces most of the building to rubble. Cavill, incidentally, is far more interesting as the taciturn Walker than he is as Superman. Back from last time is MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), a super-cool super-spy who’s especially deadly in black motorcycle leathers (pictured below). New girl on the block is the White Widow, a glamorous socialite and arms broker. She’s played with a kind of skittish ruthlessness by Vanessa Kirby (pictured top left), recalling something of her magnetic performance as Princess Margaret in The Crown. There’s enough meat in the characterisations to sustain some genuine human interest, which lends additional light and shade to the action sequences, but it’s the latter which really stick in the mind, whether it’s a thunderous Heat-style armoured car ambush beside the Seine or Hunt on a motorbike, hurtling the wrong way through the seething traffic around the Arc de Triomphe. The narrative eventually propels the team to Kashmir, where doomsday can only be averted by Hunt’s helicopter pursuit of the baddies, a scintillatingly-shot sequence in which the two aircraft swoop and plummet above steepling crags and fields of ice. The denouement threatens adrenalin-meltdown as the clock ticks down and the fate of the world hangs by a thread. If they had a competition for the all-time all-action blockbuster, Fallout would be in with a very plausible shout. Suck it up, James Bond.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2018"," “Why don’t you just die?!!!” The exasperated bad guy that shouts this question to Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible — Fallout deserves the gruesome fate awaiting him. Silly rabbit should know that our indefatigable hero is now in his 22nd year of executing dizzying, dazzling stunts. He’s not even close to slowing down. And the highly enjoyable new chapter of the saga is the preeminent popcorn movie of the summer. Yup, Cruise is still at the top of his game — not to mention the top a Paris skyscraper. You need to see it, preferably in IMAX, to truly believe it. Thought Cruise hit his adrenaline peak when he dangled from a moving plane in the opening moments of 2015’s Rogue Nation? Rookie move. Now he can use a flying helicopter as a weaponized baseball bat, crash it, then still have enough fuel in his tank to combat his enemy while dangling off the cliff of a snow-capped mountain. That’s just one white-knuckled set piece in a movie flush with ‘em. By the way, the prologue in this installment is a twisty old-school comical delight. Think of it as a crackerjack before that familiar fuse is lit. For all the death-defying thrills in Fallout, there’s a freshness to the story in that it’s the first one to build on the plot of its predecessor. Remember Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the sneering British renegade agent from Rogue Nation? Probably not, which is fine. Though he’s now in the custody of the government, he’s still a power player in the crime syndicate. This time the group is hell-bent on using plutonium to set off massive global bombs. Hunt chooses to accept a mission that involves nabbing the plutonium — and, no, the Libyans from Back to the Future don’t have it. This is no solo operation. Hunt has the help of his regular posse of experts — played by the likeably brusque Ving Rhames, comic maestro Simon Pegg and nostril-flaring Alec Baldwin. And because the IMF’s rogue brand of espionage has never appealed to the suits in Washington D.C., a new CIA chief (Angela Bassett) sticks her own guy (Henry Cavill) with the crew. The mustached Cavill is more comfortable tearing into the biggest movie star of the past 35 years than he is donning Superman’s Man of Steel cape. Meanwhile, former foe Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) has her own agenda with Lane. The fierce femme fatale every bit as, er, steely as her male counterparts. The group skips from Berlin to Paris to London to the country of Kashmir, leaving a bloody trail and mucho destruction in their wake. Yet the violence is slick enough to warrant a paltry PG-13 rating. All the more applause-worthy given that writer/director Christopher McQuarrie (who wrote Edge of Tomorrow and the Usual Suspects) packs so much in here that he essentially delivers M:I 7, M:I 8 and M:I 9 as well. When it seems like the big narrative arc might be winding down — the audience in my screening room literally burst in applause at a certain discovery — it’s really just a jumping-off point for the climactic Act III. Truth is, if you’ve seen one Mission: Impossible movie since 1996, you’ve seen ‘em all. But that adage only means that you’re once again in store for a breathless, comically tinged actionpalooza. A fight scene in a gleaming nightclub bathroom is more choreographed than the finale of a Broadway musical. Audiences flock to these M:I movies to see these hallmarks such globe-trotting adventures, high-tech toys, illogical high-stakes plots and the rubber masks designed to fool you in all sorts of fun ways. BTW, I don’t know how the IMG gets the budget to make those perfectly sculpted masks but they get me every time. Patented live-wire craziness can be immensely satisfying. As can watching a bona fine action star give his all. Cruise, who turned 56 on July 3, is finally starting to show some wear and tear. He shattered his ankle jumping off one building; there is something slight off with his face (not judging, just observing.) But he never fails to disappoint in this role. And he is the No. 1 reason this franchise remains robust. It is possible he might soon retire from the gig. Let’s make it our mission to ensure that he doesn’t.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2018"," The new Mission: Impossible opens with two scenes that, put together, constitute a clinic in how to handle exposition in a dumb, fun action spectacle. The first is a flashback-cum-dream vision in which we see the wedding of super-agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) to his long-suffering ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan). A priest (who also happens to be Solomon Lane, the villain from the last movie — don’t ask too many questions, it’s a dream) delivers the wedding vows, which gradually segue into a gruesome litany of the troubles Ethan has caused Julia over the course of this series. Just then, an ominous, explosive flash of light wakes up our hero. Now, we see that he’s all alone, in a dark, dank room somewhere in Belfast. A message arrives. It contains the details of his next mission, which involves a maze-like network of international arms dealers and nuclear scientists and nutty Year Zero anarchists, each betraying and counter-betraying the other. It’s such a dense, extravagant cascade of gobbledygook that I actually giggled in the theater as I tossed aside my notepad and pen. A cinematic centrifuge of acrobatic stunt work, breakneck chases, and immersive action, Mission: Impossible — Fallout is a perfectly calibrated piece of filmmaking that plays the viewer like a drum right from the start. Here’s a goofy dream vision to catch you up on the important emotional stakes. Got that? Good. Now, here’s some impenetrable blather to let you know that, yeah, it’s OK just to sit back and enjoy the ride. It’s not unlike what Whit Stillman achieves with the opening credits of his Jane Austen adaptation Love & Friendship, in which a hilarious rapid-fire procession of character descriptions and connections conveys the surreal intricacy of class and family loyalties in Georgian England while also relieving us of having to fuss over the cumbersome details. After that opening blast of sweet confusion, what we actually get is little more than a series of excuses to get from Shootout A to Fight B to Chase C. Some plutonium is gone missing, a terror network with a mystery leader has it, there are bombs, and secret agent Hunt and CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill) have to pretend to work with one set of bad guys to stop the other set of bad guys. That results in increasingly delirious sequences in which the duo snipe at each other while ganging up on nemeses. Meanwhile, Rebecca Ferguson, reprising her scene-stealing role from the last film as British agent Ilsa Faust, appears regularly to save our heroes’ asses. Along the way, there’s some rather predictable sexual tension between Ferguson and Cruise’s characters — and, to their credit, both actors sell it well, despite the rather chasmic age difference. But I’d argue that there’s a more compelling tension between Cavill and Cruise: They spend so much of the movie bickering and undercutting each other that their characters’ trajectory feels almost like it should be romantic. (Spoiler alert: It’s not.) And you cannot tell me that the filmmakers aren’t a little aware of this. The physical combat — in particular a spectacular three-way fight-fest in a nightclub men’s room that at one point has the participants going at it in a bathroom stall, where they are then briefly hounded by a group of eager, turned-on men who want to join in on whatever shenanigans are happening in there — boasts a vigorous, athletic grace. Everybody always seems so damned enthused to mix it up in this movie. If dancing is merely the vertical expression of a horizontal desire, then the fighting in Mission: Impossible — Fallout could be the vertical, horizontal, diagonal, spinning, up-is-down, gravity-defying expression of, well, vertical, horizontal, diagonal, spinning, up-is-down, gravity-defying desires. Beyond the playful double entendres and compromising positions, however, Mission: Impossible — Fallout represents a breakthrough for director Christopher McQuarrie, who also helmed the previous entry in the series, Rogue Nation. It’s the first time the franchise has allowed one of its auteurs a second shot behind the camera. Originally a screenwriter known for his sparkling dialogue, deft humor, and twisty plotting (he won an Oscar for The Usual Suspects), McQuarrie brought to Rogue Nation hefty doses of understated wit and lightning-fast sweep. But he’s become an even better director in the meantime, building on the earlier film’s accomplishments. He puts together the action in Fallout with a storyteller’s eye, making sure every face-off has some kind of shape, mini-narratives within narratives. The fights develop in unusual ways; the chases take unexpected turns; the camera keys in on an offhand detail or a subtle spatial relationship that later turns out to mean the world. The dispersal of information, be it through a shot, a movement or a line of dialogue, is one of the less heralded but more crucial tasks of mainstream filmmaking, and McQuarrie handles it exceptionally well. The story itself may be dumb, but the movie knows exactly what it’s doing when it comes to action and spectacle. The Mission: Impossible films were once a bit conflicted on this matter. The first one went into production as a series of elaborate set pieces with little proper narrative logic to connect them. That reportedly caused some strife during production, and the finished film — as exciting and brilliantly directed as it was — dissatisfied many fans of the original TV show, who had expected clever spycraft and selfless teamwork, not Tom Cruise killing helicopters. Since then, the best entries have worked the spectacle and the stunts. So much so that Cruise’s death-defying antics — hanging onto real jet airplanes, scaling real skyscrapers — have become a regular promotion tactic for these pictures. Cruise’s insistence on doing his own stunts, and publicizing them, once seemed like a shallow movie star indulgence, but it’s now a welcome throwback in an age of animated heroes and bloodless, computerized menace. The actor has more of those publicity-friendly antics in this one, naturally. The biggest involves climbing a rope attached to a helicopter flying over the mountains of Kashmir. But perhaps the most impressive stunt here is how he and director McQuarrie, even after all the knocks that the star’s image and career have taken over the past decade or so, have fashioned something so resoundingly exciting, so charmingly confident in its use of the star’s irrepressible charisma. I’ve enjoyed much of Cruise’s recent work, but here he does something more: He makes you believe in movie stars again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2018"," Whatever the origins of Tom Cruise’s insatiable life force — a billion-odd years of purging extraterrestrial Thetans or 50-odd years of purging terrestrial self-doubt — it shows no signs of slackening, not even after several big flops (one deserving, The Mummy, and one very much undeserving, American Made) and the Mission: Impossible-worthy escape of his third wife, Katie Holmes. His sixth Mission: Impossible movie, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, isn’t the best of the bunch (that would be number four, Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol), but it’s easily the second-best and certainly the Cruise-iest, meaning it’s nearly as entertaining as it is strenuous. Which is a mighty high bar! The writer-director Christopher McQuarrie is now Cruise’s house writer-director, and he’s a smart man. I’m not sure how much natural talent he has for action, but with Cruise lighting a fire under him, he’s learning. For the big-deal fights and chases in Fallout, he has obviously worked with great storyboard artists and a crackerjack editor (Eddie Hamilton). A fight in a blindingly light men’s room (featuring Liang Yang) is smashingly well done — a riot of broken mirrors, burst stalls, and blood on white tile. Even when Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson on a motorcycle, and assorted stunt drivers posing as bad guys smash through Paris’s Arc de Triomphe traffic circle while Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames in a high-techie boat sail beneath them, we never lose our bearings, though the number of variables approaches the exponential. (Having just returned from a vacation in Paris, I can report that the driving here is only moderately more insane than in life.) McQuarrie needs that whiplash action — and that incomparable Lalo Schifrin theme, which gives the illusion of momentum even when nothing much is happening — because the script is Mission: Impossible to Follow. Gobs of exposition pour from the mouth of Alec Baldwin as Cruises’s superior and what registers is yak-yak-McGuffin-yak-Apostles-yak-plutonium-McGuffin-the Widow-yak-yak-McGuffin. The thing to hold onto is the baddies, the Apostles, aren’t terrorists but apocalypsists — they want to destroy the world and rebuild — and that the twisty-faced Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), mysteriously left breathing at the close of the last film, is bent on blowing everything to hell. Cruise’s Ethan Hunt has to spring the hated Lane to trade for the plutonium he let slip from his grasp because he couldn’t sacrifice Luther (Rhames), so he has to dodge not just Apostles, but Angela Bassett from the CIA, her smug agent (Henry Cavill), a deadly mole whose identity isn’t much of a surprise, and Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust, who loves Ethan but has MI-6 on her ass. No, I couldn’t diagram it. But all you really need to know is that it comes down to a ticking clock; many amplified kicks and punches; and a bunch of actors grimacing at multicolored wires along with numbered dials approaching the single digits. Cruise and McQuarrie have another agenda: to make the cocky, generally unlovable star into a figure of poignancy. Rhames’s Luther repays Hunt for saving his life by delivering a speech to Ilsa along the lines of, the man loves you but the man has been through so much with his ex-wife and saving the world and he’s alone and he’s hurting so be kind, be kind … Marcellus Wallace, R.I.P. The gist is that poor Ethan — and, by implication, poor Cruise — has suffered for us and will suffer still more, which I’m happy to report that he does, with bells on, heaving himself up the face of a cliff after a helicopter crash that would have killed a lesser-paid actor. We’re also sympathetic to Cruise because Cavill is so much prettier than he is and flaunts it. Cruise doesn’t do love scenes, but as his nominal soul mate, Ferguson is as sleek and wittily self-contained as in Rogue Nation, which made her a star. She upstages everyone in the movie, possibly in the universe. Also a treat is Vanessa Kirby as the enigmatic but plainly fun-loving Widow. Cruise’s name might be high above the others in the credits, but he has the smarts to surround himself with actors we want to see and to drive his colleagues and crew to a finale that’s positively nuclear. Though not an especially attractive character, he leaves you no doubt as to why he’s a star.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2018"," Plenty of the usual spy-movie betrayals and killings, but the good guys are consistently willing to sacrifice themselves to save others. Also a theme of valuing not only many lives, but also individual ones -- and not hurting others unless you absolutely have to. Ethan Hunt operates in a world of violence and destruction but always tries to do the right thing, is brave and self-sacrificing. He cares about his team. The female characters are highly capable and brave; Erika Sloane is in a position of significant power (deputy director of the CIA), and Ilsa is core to the story. Many intense action-movie stunts with unrealistic outcomes (for example, a character is thrown from a motorcycle at high speed without a helmet, rolls a few times, and is OK). The action is stepped up from previous chapters in the already famously stunt-heavy franchise, with more intense hand-to-hand combat and vehicle chases (cars, motorcycles, helicopters, etc.). Blood is rare, but a character does get a disfiguring burn/wound. Shootings, knife fights, frequent peril. Deaths. A confusing bathroom situation could come across as a potential incident of violent gay-bashing that's thankfully nipped in the bud. Parents need to know that Mission: Impossible -- Fallout is the sixth movie in Tom Cruise's hit spy action franchise -- and the most intense. It steps up the action from previous entries in the series, which is quite a feat. The vehicle chases are much more intense than in previous episodes, and the fighting feels more visceral; blows look like they actually hurt. There are also shootings, knife fights, and deaths, but blood is rare (typical for these movies). And there's still humor; the movie doesn't feel slow or heavy, despite its nearly two-and-a-half-hour running time. Expect a bit of strong language (""s--t,"" ""bitch,"" etc., plus one use of ""f---ing""), but there's not much in the way of sex or substance use content to worry about. Main character Ethan Hunt (Cruise) remains a stand-up guy in a world full of betrayal; in general, the good guys are consistently willing to sacrifice themselves to save others. Henry Cavill and Rebecca Ferguson co-star. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE -- FALLOUT is a direct sequel to its predecessor, Mission: Impossible -- Rogue Nation. The villain from that movie, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), looms large over this one as superspy Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) races against the clock to stop Lane's followers from acquiring and detonating nuclear weapons. Hunt is helped/hindered by CIA bruiser August Walker (Henry Cavill) and enigmatic British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who also appeared in Rogue Nation. This may well be the best Mission: Impossible movie yet. Mission: Impossible -- Fallout steps up the action -- as impossible a mission as that might sound -- and the stakes, with the personal screws tightened on Hunt and horrible consequences for failure. Though spy-movie watchers will expect the requisite twists, betrayals, and MacGuffins, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie's compelling filmmaking grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Fallout delivers the death-defying stunts the series demands. The execution of, for example, the series' best car chase -- really, a car/motorcycle chase -- is so expertly done that you're less aware of the slickness than the jeopardy. Fallout also has the best fight of the series thus far (hint: it takes place in a bathroom). It's exciting and visceral, with real emotional impact. Cruise's performance is lean and focused, and hopefully Ferguson is now a fixture in the series; she can act and fight. It's also fun to see Superman (Cavill) brawling like an utter brute. Rob Hardy's (Ex Machina) cinematography captures everything we need to track the action while also conveying different atmospheres, moods, and textures. Each of the film's locations -- exotic, dingy, or otherwise -- is well-served. Eddie Hamilton's editing is superb; he's amassing a spectacular resume (X-Men: First Class, Kingsman: The Secret Service). Lorne Balfe's versatile score builds on previous entries while recalling Hans Zimmer's Bat-music and Jóhann Jóhannson's nerve-rattling Sicario. Fight coordinator Wolfgang Stegemann and stunt coordinator Wade Eastwood pull rabbits out of their hats. So does featured fight performer Liang Yang; let's see more of that guy! Given the deeply ingrained habits of this genre, it's hard to surprise veteran fans. But McQuarrie and company get fresh reactions with the effective and thrilling Fallout by involving us in the dilemmas, making us feel the atmosphere and ticking clock, and hitting every action beat, dead center. Families can talk about the violence in Mission: Impossible -- Fallout. Does it seem more intense than in previous M:I movies? Was there any difference in its emotional impact as a result? Is it what you expect from this type of movie? Did the stakes seem different to you here than in other M:I movies? If so, why? Did the way the filmmakers treat Ethan's personal relationships have an effect on the stakes? Ethan and his team are technically operating outside of the law. Are they still ""good guys""? Where are the lines that separate them from their enemies? Do you consider Ethan a role model? Talk about Ilsa. How often is a woman shown holding her own against a formidable male lead in an action film? What message does it send that Ilsa does that here?

"Jul 18, 2018",The Mission: Impossible series reconfirms its status as one of the all-time great action franchises with one jaw-dropping thrill sequence after another.,POSITIVE
"Jul 18, 2018"," THERE’S a term given to football players when they’ve given their all during a match: leaving it on the field. And likewise, there’s a scene at the end of Mission: Impossible – Fallout, which sees an exhausted Tom Cruise lying flat on his back, in which he looks as though he has literally done just that. Few modern movie stars throw themselves into stunt-work with as much gusto as Cruise. But therein lies one of the great joys of watching this sixth instalment in the seemingly indefatigable Mission: Impossible series unfold… the stunts are breathtakingly brilliant. Christopher McQuarrie, the returning writer-director of fifth entry Rogue Nation, has upped the ante considerably for this breakneck adventure, combining thrilling action with high stakes personal investment and a plot shot through with deception and betrayal. Fallout rates among the best in a series that isn’t short on highlights. It’s fast moving, even at a couple of minutes shy of two and a half hours, but it’s also engrossing. And it’s sly enough to compensate for some of its shortcomings. The plot, this time, finds Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF colleagues once more scrambling to save the world from a nuclear threat after a mission has gone wrong. In doing so, they must reluctantly take on board new member Walker (Henry Cavill), a CIA operative sent to observe and possibly usurp them, while putting aside personal feelings for former villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, still orchestrating the mayhem he created in Rogue Nation) and MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), once more throwing a spanner in the works with her conflicting loyalties. McQuarrie has a track record for penning slick dialogue and twisting storylines (he wrote The Usual Suspects and The Way of The Gun after all), and is given free reign to go as convoluted as needs be here. But he also drops in the odd knowing wink to the storyline’s absurdity, whether in the facial expressions of his leading players as they’re faced with the next impossible scenario, or in some of the more OTT dialogue exchanges (as exemplified by Alec Baldwin’s IMF chief). By doing so, he also gets away with some of the film’s weaker elements. For while Fallout is undoubtedly gripping and clever, it’s not as surprising as it perhaps could have been (coming from a writer of McQuarrie’s calibre). A couple of the ‘reveals’ are a little too obvious, while the screenplay does eventually drop in some clunky emotional exchanges relating to Cruise’s character. That being said, Fallout really delivers where it matters most: in spectacle. The action sequences genuinely do astound, by virtue of their chutzpah, magnitude and ability to exhilarate. What’s more, there are so many of them. A three-way fight in a men’s toilet in Paris is brilliant for the way in which it combines bone-crunching choreography with sublime humour; a motorcycle chase also in Paris is breathlessly exciting; a foot chase across the rooftops of London is supremely well staged (and wince-inducing come the now notorious ankle breaking leap), and the climactic helicopter pursuit over fjords and mountains just mind-blowing in terms of ambition and scale. The film delivers time and time again. Cruise, as previously mentioned, gives everything for the cause. He’s a whirlwind of energy and enthusiasm, and yet prone to moments of vulnerability and self-deprecation. It’s a nicely judged performance that endears Hunt as a character even more. But there’s strong support from the likes of Ferguson (once again striking a blow for the feminist movement), Harris (suitably creepy as Lane), Cavill (muscular and no-nonsense) and Simon Pegg (once more providing the humour to offset some of the more serious elements). If Mission: Impossible – Fallout turns out to be the last hurrah for this particular franchise, then it’s a mighty high on which to end on. But such is the energy and enjoyment of the film that the prospect of a seventh entry still excites, so long as Cruise’s body can live up to the challenge!",POSITIVE

Tom Cruise is 56 years old. Fifty. Six. And he’s been making ‘Mission: Impossible’ movies for 22 of those 56 years. By all rights, ‘Fallout’, his sixth high-flying mission, should be to ‘M:I’ what ‘A View to a Kill’ was to Roger Moore’s Bond (Moore being only a year older than Cruise is when he made his final 007): tired, creaky and a bit embarrassing.Astonishingly, however, the opposite is true. This is easily the best, slickest and most daring ‘Mission: Impossible’ instalment. Not only that, it’s the finest action movie of the year so far. The bait-and-switching, double-crossing plot twists and twists again, with Hunt still haunted by his now-incarcerated ‘Rogue Nation’ nemesis Solomon Lane (a superbly creepy Sean Harris) and dealing with the global terrorist power vacuum left by Lane’s capture, but you won’t care with all the sinew-straining spectacle on show.This is thanks largely to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie. Being the first director to return for a second go at the franchise, he brings a sense of continuity hitherto lacking. ‘Fallout’ is a direct sequel to ‘Rogue Nation’, bringing back most of the key players and upping the stakes from the most knowing of perspectives. McQuarrie also builds on the last film’s self-aware level of wit and, most importantly, its set-piece-crafting sophistication.No action sequence is allowed to peter out, or be chopped to ribbons in the edit, or lean on the crutch of CG augmentation. From a frantic Parisian chase to a brutal brawl in a loo to the climactic mountain-skimming helicopter fight, it’s fantastically executed throughout. And it pays just enough attention to physics to make you feel like it all could really be happening. Then, of course, you have Cruise at the heart of the maelstrom. Like, really there. If there are switches to doubles, they are ingeniously hidden. This guy commits to an insane degree, and in mainstream entertainment terms, ‘Fallout’ is up there with his best work. If he keeps McQuarrie on board, we’d happily see him do six more missions. We’re sure he could hack it.

"Jul 18, 2018"," The terrorists’ manifesto in the spiffy new “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” hinges its action plan for global slaughter on the phrase “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” So cruel. And yet so applicable to the ways of the action franchise! In his sixth round as Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt, certified movie star Tom Cruise, 56 but fully in Dorian Gray mode, has never suffered more grievous bodily harm. Nor has he risked his neck more flagrantly than in the trademark death-defiance on view here. Some of it’s pleasingly old school in its reliance on formidable stunt work. Enough of it, though, gets a digital effects assist for the amazements to scale the heights of plausibility and then leap, like a gazelle, to the adjacent mountain of sublime ridiculousness. Helicopters play chicken inside a snowy ravine in Kashmir. In Paris, Cruise motorcycles the wrong way (which, in movie terms, is very much the right way) around the Arc de Triomphe while dozens of stunt drivers duck and dodge. In London, Cruise sprints after his prey along a hazardous rooftop route near the Tate museum, and it’s like the fastest-ever walking tour of a major world capital, requiring the most number of insurance waivers. FYI, the movie’s really good. The technical finesse, sleek assurance and reassuring grooves of director Christopher McQuarrie’s second “M:I” assignment, following “Rogue Nation,” come with just enough twists in the narrative to justify 147 minutes of summer movie. McQuarrie wrote the script as well as directed it. Three plutonium cores have gone missing, and if they end up in the hands of the rogue terrorism cadre known as the Apostles, bad news. The glaring anarchist from “Rogue Nation,” played by Sean Harris, remains Hunt’s chief adversary. Other key figures in the previous McQuarrie “M:I” film return, notably Hunt’s sometime sort-of lover, assassin Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson).  The IMF team leader is again played, with droll inscrutability, by Alec Baldwin. Ving Rhames and his hat are back; like Cruise, they’ve been there since the first movie, the one directed by Brian De Palma back in 1996. (Bruce Geller’s hit TV series, debuting in 1966, started it all.) The film’s gratifyingly paced opening finds Hunt under fire, and juggling ruses, with Luther (Rhames, always in the van, that guy) and techno-wonk Benji (Simon Pegg, more subdued this time out). In the first shootout Hunt makes a crucial decision revealing his vulnerability. From there “Fallout” keeps falling out or, rather, hurtling forward, rolling in new characters. Angela Bassett is the CIA director, ready to hang Hunt out to dry at a moment’s notice. Her pet assassin is played by Henry Cavill, the movies’ current Superman. He’s not what you’d call an enlivener; Cavill’s a block of wood, actually, unable to make a single line of dialogue sound either enjoyably fake or plausibly human. Yet as the movie twists and turns, the tetchy relationship established between Cavill’s gun-for-hire and Cruise’s Hunt lends “Fallout” a secondary source of tension. These competitive fellows HALO-jump out of a plane; they battle a deft antagonist (Liang Yang) inside a men’s room stall (!) , and then outside of it, in the Paris Palais. Also, Michelle Monaghan returns as Hunt’s eternal beloved, reminding him what it’s all for. McQuarrie piles on the mayhem like a boss. His “M:I” films exude class, intelligent expense and giddy expansiveness in equal measure. He makes the mistake, I think, of amping up the violence in the final round (the box office will likely disagree). The stunts really are enough without the cranes to the cranium and that sort of thing. On balance I prefer “Rogue Nation,” but this one’s a walloping success on its own. And there are tasty details, such as Kristoffer Joner (as a mad Norwegian scientist) cackling in close-up, or “The Crown’s”Vanessa Kirby slinking around as the “White Widow,” an arms broker with an exceptional sense of style.",POSITIVE
"Jul 18, 2018"," This is not only the so-ridiculous-that-it’s-actually-brilliant statement Alec Baldwin delivers to the UK Prime Minister with a straight face in Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation (M:I-5). It’s also a fitting summary for the entirety of Hollywood’s greatest running action franchise, as well as its near-flawless latest installment, Mission: Impossible – Fallout (M:I-6), starring one of Planet Earth’s few remaining mega movie stars: Tom Cruise. When his relentless ‘Impossible Mission Force’ (IMF) agent Ethan Hunt is near any trouble of catastrophic proportions—either within a jumping distance from the rooftop across or the helicopter above—you know things are destined to work out in the end and the universe’s most villainous enemies are going to fall to their eventual demise. Even if it means the morally principled Hunt has to put his own life at fatal risk to save those he loves, damn it. Lucky for him (and for the rest of us, adrenaline addicts, desperately craving our M:I fix every few years), Hunt has managed to successfully complete all his 6-films-worth-of-missions he chose to accept with “only” a severely broken ankle. And to clarify, when I say Hunt, I actually mean Cruise, who’s been steering the M:I ship ever since director Brian de Palma lit the fuse for the first film, adapted from the beloved TV series of impressive face masks and retro gadgets. Famously doing his own mind-blowing stunts with as little green screen as possible (remember that Burj Khalifa skyscraper climb in Ghost Protocol?), Cruise apparently came very close to facing his own destiny during the filming of Fallout (by the returning writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, the series’ only repeat filmmaker), and lived to tell the tale with a shattered limb. The logic-defying London building jump that caused his injury is actually a scene in the film. As Graham Norton puts it here upon viewing the footage from various angles, “this is why Tom Cruise gets paid the big bucks,” folks. For further context, take a look at the star’s Twitter profile: “Running in movies since 1981,” his bio simply says. Rest assured, that’s exactly what Tom Cruise, the runner, continues to do in the terrific and terrifying Fallout, including directly after the stunt-in-question. “What about his broken ankle,” you might rightfully ask. Well, who has time to waste with that minor detail when the planet’s future hangs in balance and Henry Cavill’s shady, disagreeably mustached CIA agent August Walker is on the loose? Tom Cruise, we appreciate your sacrifice. Returning as Ilsa Faust, a marvelously Lauren Bacall-esque character first introduced in Rogue Nation, Rebecca Ferguson refers to the task in Fallout as “a suicide mission“. On an incompatible mission of her own, Faust is far from wrong. In this world, there are twists within twists (who is better at gotcha than McQuarrie, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Usual Suspects), friends within fiends and nothing is what it seems. But the team’s rough purpose simply boils down to securing three identical nuclear weapons from a terrorist group called “The Apostles”; a collective who wants to destroy today’s dysfunctional world order and start things from scratch, under the leadership of a mysterious figure called John Lark. To stop him, Hunt (as usual) is joined by his IMF counterparts Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg), receives the support of the newly minted IMF head Alan Hunley (Baldwin), and hindered by the CIA yet again. After Hunley’s switch to the IMF in the previous film, the contrastingly by-the-book intelligence agency finds a new leader in the no-nonsense Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett), who puts Cavill’s Walker to task to tail the IMF. Also in the mix are Hunt’s ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and a brand-new femme fatale named White Widow (Vanessa Kirby, absolutely breathtaking in every sense of the word), a coldly iniquitous dealer. Yes, it’s a crowded field of players and you need to pay attention to connect all the dots. Since this is a direct sequel to Rogue Nation, I’d strongly recommend that you watch it before diving into Fallout, if for no other reason than basking in the seductiveness of the Hunt-Faust chemistry. Their tense byplay comes with a glorious back-story of equals, which at once feels both old-fashioned and hopelessly romantic. And this combo is why the M:I franchise continues to work. Its muscle is always backed with strong morals (evident in every turn in Fallout) and its heart, beneath its injured body, is perennially light with memorable humor. Here’s another, equally important reason why the series has managed to maintain and even up its appeal with every chapter: its utmost dedication to avoiding mind-numbing action. If you want to munch your popcorn while stuff aimlessly gets blown up in frustratingly incoherent action scenes, you might want to consider taking your motorbike elsewhere. Despite being the biggest, boldest and loudest M:I movie to date, every single Fallout action sequence, may it be a high-speed pursuit or a HALO jump, remains impeccably constructed and tightly edited to maximum heart-stopping impact, thanks to both the cinematographer Rob Hardy and editor Eddie Hamilton. If you can dare to breathe during its superbly orchestrated finale (set in Kashmir, actually shot in New Zealand), in which Cruise dangles from a helicopter and swings on the sharp edges of rocky mountains with a precarious hook and his bare hands, you’re made of stronger stuff than I am. Full disclosure: after seeing Fallout, I restlessly paced my apartment like a maniac and reached for hard liquor to calm the f* down. When I finally achieved a relaxed state, I began noticing I missed a crucial thing in this otherwise superb movie: a quiet and contained centerpiece, akin to De Palma’s masterful Langley sequence in the first M:I, Brad Bird’s aforementioned Burj Khalifa scene in Ghost Protocol, and the underwater mission in McQuarrie’s own Rogue Nation. While McQuarrie certainly nods to his predecessors with Fallout—there is even a superbly pulled off, martial-arts-y bathroom fight scene reminiscent of the John Woo directed fist battles of M:I-2—he takes the signature heart-pound of the series several steps further. The set pieces feel longer (nothing will prepare you for the hysterical opening involving a Wolf Blitzer cameo), the motorcycle chases seem crazier (McQuarrie admits to honoring Claude Lelouch’s short Rendezvous with the insane Paris-set pursuit they filmed with a helmet-less Cruise) and the whole package ticks like a bomb with personal and global stakes higher than ever before. While that missing centerpiece mission with a controlled scope is an unfortunate neglect, the stunning finale that measures up to the finest set pieces of Dunkirk and Mad Max: Fury Road considerably lessens the pain of its absence. After two hours and twenty-seven minutes of non-stop Cruise’ing, it won’t be exhaustion you’ll feel, but a hunger for more. Keep running, keep dreaming, keep surviving, Tom Cruise. We sure as hell can use an unbeatable flesh-and-blood screen hero with real, breakable muscles these days; one who peels himself off the ground when he falls and sprints forward despite the odds.",POSITIVE
"Jul 18, 2018"," In an era of sloppy and forgettable action flicks on the one hand and overly serious “gritty” franchises on the other, the Mission: Impossible movies strike a pleasing balance between memorable action sequences and smaller-scale character intrigue. They’re whatever the opposite of “self-important” is. And of course, like all the other movies in the series, a new Mission: Impossible entry brings another opportunity to see what kind of ridiculous stunts Tom Cruise, age 56, will put himself through for our viewing pleasure. The sixth installment, Mission: Impossible — Fallout, brings all that to the table once again, and it just may be the best blockbuster of the summer. Suitably goofy, with the requisite masks and high-stakes stunts that mark the series, Fallout also pins its story on a lightly considered version of the always-relevant trolley problem: Is it better to save one person from destruction at the cost of many other lives, or to choose to destroy one person to save the lives of many? Let me be clear: Even though it does put a spin on one of pop culture’s favorite philosophical questions — The Good Place had an entire episode titled “The Trolley Problem” — Fallout is not a “brainy” blockbuster. It does not really have anything to say about, for instance, human nature, or geopolitics, or much of anything else. That’s a shame in some respects. For instance, the movie raises but then almost immediately drops an intriguing thread about a terrorist targeting all of the world’s major religions.  But in truth, in all but the steadiest hands, too much heady stuff tends to gum up the works in films that are mainly meant to showcase cool stunts and improbable plot twists, which this film has in spades.  The plot, which is pleasantly murky, moves along at a good clip. Super-agent Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF buddies Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) are on the trail of a terrorist going by the name of John Lark, who is purportedly working with a group of 12 people called “the Apostles” to blow up the world. Lark is pursuing some nuclear material to finish the bombs, and Ethan is sent to stop him.  In this, he’s being overseen by Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), who made a lateral move into the IMF, and working in concert with a CIA agent named August Walker (Henry Cavill), in a mission directed by Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett). Fallout also brings back some familiar faces: terrorist/former IMF agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), who’s been languishing in custody since Ethan put him away in Rogue Nation, and British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who’s got a complicated mission of her own. The plot twists loopily for a great deal of the film’s nearly two-and-a-half-hour runtime until it settles into its final trajectory, but that’s part of the fun. Christopher McQuarrie, who directed and co-wrote Rogue Nation, returns as solo writer and director on Fallout; he’s nailed the series’ impish, ambitious voice and also injected it with a bit of heart. There are several fun action set pieces that don’t disappoint, and the final sequence, which takes place over the Kashmir mountains, is a bit of a heart-stopper. (It’s probably worth the cost of an IMAX ticket for that scene alone.) Aside from the pyrotechnics and high-speed, high-elevation chases, Fallout does contain an interesting kernel of moral inquiry, and it’s worth noting. It comes back to the trolley problem. Early on, it becomes clear that for those within Ethan’s world of high-stakes, world-saving spy games, there are two fundamentally different ways to approach their jobs. For some, it’s better for an operative, an asset, or even just a bystander to lose his or her life if it means that a large number of people’s lives may be saved. It is, put simply, a numbers game.  For others, though — including Ethan — the idea of sacrificing the life of someone you love, like a dear friend and colleague, is unthinkable, even if it may mean handing over the means of destruction to a foe. Your outlook may also dictate how you do your job. Agent Walker, for instance, wouldn’t blink an eye at the idea of having to kill a dozen police officers to make off with a potentially dangerous terrorist in their custody. His reputation precedes him, and he’s known for his gun-happy tactics. Ethan, on the other hand, is a little more improvisational, and is forever trying to find ways around killing anyone, even if it means executing a somewhat preposterous and possibly slapdash plan to do so. Ethan’s way happens to make for thrilling cinema, but it also unearths a hole that shows up in a lot of action movies. Fallout features a badass, brilliant action hero who also never kills anyone without looking them straight in the eye first and visibly weighing the moral choice before him.  These decisions happen several times in the film — sometimes with clear enemies, sometimes in situations that are much blurrier — and aren’t always resolved; sometimes another person ends up stepping in and doing the killing on Ethan’s behalf. Still, it’s an interesting contrast with, say, Skyscraper, in which the obviously morally upright family man at its center seems not to even pause for thought about taking lives.  That just makes for a more interesting character. Ethan Hunt is, all told, dull from a character standpoint; he pines for his lost love, and he doesn’t really follow rules very well. But highlighting this added dimension to his character helps round him out a little. The moral dilemmas round out Fallout’s worldview as well. In several conversations and statements, a point of view emerges: Actually, there may not be a “right” answer to the trolley problem. Keeping the world safe may actually require people with both perspectives to cooperate. Someone who has to keep the big picture in mind may need to be able to disconnect from individuals a bit to keep an eye on the big-scale repercussions. But it’s just as important for operatives on the ground to act according to heart, gut, and conscience, instead of abstract, machine-like reasoning. Inevitably, dramatic tension arises from that conflict — and that makes for a better movie. In addition to the absurd stunts and convoluted plot machinations, what makes the Mission: Impossible movies work in general, and Fallout in particular, is that they let their characters be characters, driven by a number of complex factors, even when they’re chasing an enemy or trying to get out of a scrape. I don’t know how much longer this franchise will last — surely Cruise has to slow down eventually — but as long as there are Mission: Impossible movies like this, we’ll be guaranteed a good time at the movies.

"Jul 16, 2018"," If impossibly fabulous  stunts are all that you want out a summer movie, Mission: Impossible – Fallout would be a dream come true for action junkies. Hell, it still is, despite a convoluted plot that makes this mission virtually impossible to follow. At 56, and so not looking it, Tom Cruise is back as IMF (Impossible Mission Force) undercover agent Ethan Hunt – and in the running, jumping, climbing, diving, flipping, fighting shape of his life. And as the last few M:I movies, that’s Cruise putting his ass on the line; witness the YouTube footage of his well-publicized ankle break he suffered while rooftop leaping. The practical effects, meaning the real stuff the computer never touched, make all the difference when you’re asking audiences to see the characters as human instead pawns in a digital game. Fallout is the sixth chapter in the series and the second (after 2015’s Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation) to be directed by  Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for his screenplay for The Usual Suspects. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to stop thinking about the plot as soon as possible. Faced with a parade of life-or-death challenges, Hunt likes to say, “I’ll figure it out.” He does. You may not be so lucky with McQuarrie’s script, however. The basic setup: Three spheres of plutonium are missing, which means the end of the world – it always does – if the contraband gets into the wrong hands. A mystery psycho who calls himself John Lark believes that only real suffering can save what’s left of the real world. His ally in obliterating the globe is anarchist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the villain from the last M:I movie; he’s now sporting a beard and a fixed stare that gives him that chic nutso-Unabomber look. Hunt’s IMF chief (Alec Baldwin) wants Solomon captured, as does the head of the CIA, played by Angela Bassett. And there’s Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust nosing around again. No one seems trustworthy, except for Ethan’s crew: tech wiz Benji (the invaluable Simon Pegg) and bomb specialist Luther (a rock-steady Ving Rhames). It’s the latter who almost blows the operation, since our hero opts to rescue him instead of the plutonium. We now have a theme: Is saving one life more important than saving the lives of millions? Also: There’s fresh blood on the scene. Henry Cavill, on leave from puffing up as the DCEU’s stalwart Superman, brings unexpected twists to the role of Walker, a CIA agent assigned to watch Ethan’s every move. And best of all, there’s Vanessa Kirby (just Emmy nominated for playing Princess Margaret on The Crown) as the White Widow, a knife-wielding femme fatale with a gift for arms dealing and an eye for Ethan. Except he’s still hung up on his ex-wife (Michelle Monaghan), who’s fighting a smallpox plague in Kashmir. Got that? Of course you don’t. There’s really no excuse for padding a two-and-a-half hour film with so much needless exposition. But you bear with it, because the set pieces are so off-the-charts spectacular. There’s Cruise, clearly having the time of his life, leaping over those London rooftops, putting pedal to the metal through the death-curves of Paris streets, duking it out with goons in a nightclub bathroom, skydiving out of transport plane at 25,000 feet in a lightning storm or piloting a chopper out of a death spiral that makes IMAX the preferred way to see this movie. There’s a rumor that Fallout may be the last big-screen Mission: Impossible we get. If so, then at least Cruise – who started this series of super-sized, adrenaline-fueled blockbusters 22 years ago – is going out in a blaze of glory.",POSITIVE
"Jul 15, 2018"," Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Luther (Ving Rhames) are back and once again must work together to stop Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) from destroying the world. When Ethan’s latest IMF mission doesn’t go as planned, Solomon Lane escapes from Belfast with some plutonium. However, Solomon isn’t the only threat this time around as the mysterious John Lark runs a radical terrorist group (The Apostles) and wants nothing more than to blow the world into a million pieces. After failing to protect the plutonium, Ethan’s loyalty to the CIA is quickly questioned. Ethan is forced, once again, to go rogue to stop Lark and Solomon from setting off a series of nuclear bombs. Christopher McQuarrie returns to the Mission Impossible franchise. However, this time around, McQuarrie is not only directing but has taken on full writing responsibility. In 2015, McQuarrie directed Rogue Nation, which critics and audiences praised for its high octane action and I do consider Rogue Nation the best film in the series so far. I think it goes without saying that McQuarrie set the bar very high and with him coming back for seconds, I was very excited to see what he had in store for audiences that were anxiously awaiting Mission Impossible: Fallout. Mission: Impossible Fallout is another great sequel in what has become one of the best action film franchises of all time.  Tom Cruise continues to prove that nobody, and I mean nobody does action the way he does. I feel like the older Cruise is, the more he pushes himself. There is something to be said about an actor that truly commits to his craft. Cruise isn’t afraid of pushing the limits. I feel like every single Mission Impossible film becomes more and more intense with stunts that have to be seen to be believed. Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt has always been a terrific casting choice. The level of authenticity that Cruise brings to this role is second to none. He is Ethan Hunt and has been the driving force of this franchise since it started back in 1996. Watching Cruise in Fallout honestly makes you question how the heck he is still alive. When watching Cruise run and jump off buildings there is something special about seeing that happen without stuntmen involved. It honestly makes you wonder why more actors aren’t like Tom Cruise.  He is seriously one of the only action superstars in the world that isn’t afraid of cheating death to create exhilarating action sequences. What stands out the most about this franchise is that there is little to no CGI or green-screen being used. I watch a ton of action movies, and even the great superhero films from Marvel and DC use a ton of CGI and visual effects. What you see happening on-screen in Fallout is brought to life by McQuarrie and Cruise. The car chase scenes are shot in such a way where you feel as though you are part of the action. There is also a helicopter scene during the climax of the film that will blow your freaking mind. Between the action in Rogue Nation and Fallout, I think McQuarrie has rightfully become the master of action movies. Apart from the action, this franchise continues to impress with casting. I have already talked about how Tom Cruise owns this franchise but the supporting cast is all around terrific. Simon Pegg’s Benji and Ving Rhames’ Luther are the perfect sidekicks to play alongside Ethan Hunt. Each of these actors brings something to Fallout by adding humor, intelligence, and heart to the story.  One can even argue that Benji and Luther are just as important to this franchise as Ethan Hunt is. I honestly couldn’t picture this franchise without them being part of it. There are a lot of characters in Fallout and while most of them work some of them leave more to be desired. I found Sean Harris’ performance this time around to be rather bland. Solomon felt like a very generic action movie villain, and I guess I expected more from him considering how well he brought Solomon to life in Rogue Nation. My feelings towards Henry Cavill as August Walker are mixed. I am a fan of Cavill and think he is a terrific Superman, but something about this role didn’t always work for me. It is sort of hard to explain but sometimes I felt like Cavill’s performance was too cheesy or wooden. It’s weird because, at other times during the film, I felt like he was great especially during the bathroom fight scene. The women in Fallout bring a lot to the table. I can’t tell you how happy I was when I read that Rebecca Ferguson was returning to the franchise. Ferguson’s IIsa Faust is such a badass character that owns the screen every second that she is on it. Ferguson gets a lot of screentime, and her character plays a major role as to how Ethan’s story unfolds. I don’t want to give anything away, but fans of IIsa Faust will be happy with how the story uses her in this entry. Vanessa Kirby, who is terrific on The Crown, is an excellent addition to the cast. Since I am not too familiar with her work, I was pleasantly surprised to see how her character Alana aka The White Widow was used in the film. While Kirby is probably only in the film for about 15 to 20 minutes, I do believe that her character will show up once again in future installments. Michelle Monaghan returns in Fallout and has just as much screen-time as Kirby. Monaghan’s role is rather small but is essential to the progression of the story. Again, don’t want to ruin anything but there is sort of a passing of the torch at the end of this film. For the most part, the script is excellent. Fallout is one of those films where a lot is going on and could be hard to follow if you aren’t paying close attention. McQuarrie’s script contains a lot of twists and turns that generated quite the reaction during my screening. I do think that while a lot of the surprises deliver, there are a few that I found to be a tad too predictable for their good. I should also mention that Fallout is the longest Mission Impossible film to date. I bring this up because I do think the film felt a little long at times. I do think that 10-15 minutes could have easily been shaved off of the runtime and would have created a smoother paced film. Fallout proves once again Mission Impossible is one of the best action movie franchises of all time. McQuarrie and Cruise are a match made in cinematic heaven and have created pure action movie magic together. Fallout confirms that lightning can strike twice and that it will be nearly impossible that any other action film this year will be able to top it. The Mission Impossible Franchise is a like a fine wine; it continues to get better with age. As someone who always complains about the lack of originality in Hollywood, I would happily sit through a new Mission Impossible every year or two as long as they keep raising the bar as the new action movie standard.",POSITIVE
"Jul 14, 2018"," This latest installment of the Mission Impossible franchise is unmitigated fun with its deliciously overwrought motorcycle chases, hellish helicopter skirmishes, frenzied fisticuffs, plus rooftop jumpings galore. My favorite is the restroom decimation. Most beneficial to our joy is that Mr. Tom Cruise has stopped making gossip headlines in the last year or so. He’s only garnered press for injuring himself during an MI stunt. There’s no added Oprahesque/religious/marital baggage to distract us from sitting back and being totally enveloped in this “global cultural icon’s”* portrayal of the troubled Tom Hunt as he puts aside his own personal problems to safeguard the world from three plutonium bombs that have fallen into the hands of those who plan to trade them to terrorists. The plot itself is much too complex to try to introduce to you here. (Something about a bonkers anarchist (Sean Harris) and his group, the Apostles, and their desire to overthrow world order.) And, yes, there are moments when you are about to say, “Huh!” But before you can scratch your head in bewilderment, the film hurtles forth at such a great speed from Belfast to Paris to London to Kashmir that you’ve forgotten that it might not at all make sense. It sort of does though in retrospect. Aiding Mr. Cruise are his regular sidekicks: Simon Pegg as Benji and Ving Rhames as Luther. Both add much needed humor to the proceedings. Rebecca Ferguson also appears again as Ilsa Faust, the ass-kicking, sharp shooter who has won over Hunt’s heart. And if the Oscars come up with an award for best cameo, Wolf Blitzer will definitely get a nomination for his solid comic turn here. As for writer/director Christopher McQuarrie’s helming, although he lacks Paul (Bourne Ultimatum) Greengrass’s artfulness, his sensibility is a perfect complement to a large popcorn and a Coke. The man, who won an Oscar for The Usual Suspects screenplay in 1996, tries to pull out all the stops here, and he pretty much succeeds. The result will be a huge hit, or is one already, which means get ready for Missions Impossible 7, 8, and 9—and at least another two decades of the personable Mr. Cruise doing what he does best.",POSITIVE

"Jul 13, 2018"," ""Why did you have to make it so fucking complicated?"" Henry Cavill bellows somewhere around the two-hour mark of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, a sentiment I shared while watching the franchise's latest instalment, which is replete with truly outstanding action sequences but marred by the most convoluted M:I plot to date. When an IMF mission goes seriously awry (and I mean seriously, Ethan probably should have retired on the spot given the apocalyptic repercussions) Hunt sets about cleaning up his mess, attempting to thwart a terrorist group while - as is M:I tradition - his bosses assume he's gone rogue. Double-crossing and heists-within-heists are trademarks of the franchise and partly what make it so fun, but here characters outmanoeuvre each other so flippantly and incessantly that after a while you just stop caring. This, however, is the secret to getting the most out of Fallout, which is best enjoyed not as a narrative but a festoon of set-pieces. Tom Cruise's insistence on doing his own stunts is now such a big part of the series that I'm not sure it could carry on if he suddenly decides he no longer wants to risk dying in a ball of fire and helicopter propeller blades on a remote mountain. This real-world peril has become the central appeal of the films as we wonder just how far directors, insurers and on-set health and safety reps will let the Cruiser go before saying enough is enough.  Clearly, they're not at that point yet. Cruise outdoes himself with Fallout, parkour-ing over London rooftops, carving through traffic around the Arc de Triomphe on a motorbike and clinging from helicopters and cliff faces in Kashmir. A particularly sensational stunt revolves around a HALO (high altitude, low open) skydive, which during filming saw Cruise jump out of a plane many thousands of feet in the air and not open his parachute until he was close enough to the ground that larger canidae could be made out and various fauna identified. He emphasis the danger of the manoeuvre in the film, succinctly telling a fellow skydiver to be careful to deploy the chute in time or ""the last thing that goes through your mind will be your knees."" Cruise is an iconic and eminently meme-able sprinter, and sprints like never before here across multiple continents. That Tom Cruise will one day be too old to sprint for our pleasure makes me profoundly sad. Every ounce of credit I can summon goes to Cruise and his fellow stuntmen and coordinators and choreographers, then, who have undoubtedly managed the franchise's (and possible the genre's) most thrilling action sequences to date without relying on VFX. It's only a shame that other elements of the production let them down. The supporting cast of Fallout are dreadful. Henry Cavill is barely sentient as CIA agent August Walker, while Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust manages to be not only devoid of a discernible personality but completely superfluous to the plot. Simon Pegg continues to provide unnecessary and perfunctory comic relief as computer whizz Benji, while Ving Rhames is underused, as always, back in his role of fixer Luther Stickell. Then there's the villains, who are of vague and inscrutable evilness, beardy Brits with very thin and inexplicable plans for world destruction. In fairness, Alec Baldwin's IMF Secretary invigorates the few scenes he is in, and Vanessa Kirby's broker character White Widow deserved a bigger piece of the action, but the general impression is of charisma machine Tom Cruise carrying everyone through this breathtaking and yet somehow wearying 147 minutes. Fallout has an unexpectedly beautiful score, is pleasingly assembled - with washed-out pink/cream hue - and has a hulking overall tone to it that is a departure for the series and falls somewhere in-between Heat and Sicario. That's not a bad area to be in, but while its action chops outstrip both, in terms of narrative and character Fallout lags behind. The IMF team's historic predilection for rubber face masks, night-at-the-opera hijinks and a generally theatrical approach to sleuthing is mocked by the new guard at the CIA in the film as archaic and whimsical, but I for one miss it.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 13, 2018"," ★★★★☆A long-running and often erratic spy franchise, once in danger of dwindling into wearisome repetition, soars back to stratospheric heights in this sixth and most satisfying instalment yet. The writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and indefatigable leading man Tom Cruise deliver two and a half hours of cake-and-eat-it mayhem, a globetrotting blockbuster that’s ironic and bombastic, predictable and ingenious, and a vehicle for a 56-year-old star who makes a virtue out of his tendency to transform the entire movie into a showcase for ever more perilous stunts.",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," Mission: Impossible - Fallout shatters every bone in the body, crashes aircraft in blazes of glory, smashes pristine porcelain sinks to jagged bits, singes Henry Cavill’s mustache hairs, rips French infrastructure in two and defies the laws of physics with the glee of the Jackass crew.  What the sixth installment of Tom Cruise’s stunt-heavy spy franchise doesn’t break are the rules: Executed by Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, Fallout uses film conventions, page-turner dialogue and precision action to write an IMAX-sized textbook on how to have a hell of a good time at the movies. Past Mission: Impossible sequels have looked to aspects of the TV show and modern spy thrillers to find ways to subvert expectations. McQuarrie adapts the series’ lit-fuse title treatment into a two-hour movie, and every second thrills. Previously, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt has dealt with the pressure of life-or-death missions and the government’s constant scrutiny of the IMF, his off-the-books intelligence organization. In Fallout, Hunt deals with hang-ups normally reserved for Superman: Is it more important to save one person or a million people? Must a hero always say yes to the job? What if it means putting people you love in the line of fire? McQuarrie leans harder into the franchise’s history than ever before — marathon M:I one through five if you have time — to ask big questions about the spy’s role on this planet.  True to the movie’s style, the filmmaker also finds a clever way to blurt out the thesis. Hunt’s arch-nemesis Solomon Lane — bearded, bruised, and bound in straps — gets under the spy’s skin with a simple question: “‘Your mission, if you choose to accept it’ ... have you ever said no?” As we learn courtesy of an 8 mm film reel tucked inside a copy of The Odyssey, Hunt’s latest task is to eliminate “John Lark,” the code-named leader of a terrorist group known as The Apostles, who intend to annihilate humanity and spawn a New World Order. Unfortunately for Earth, The Apostles are in possession of three loads of weapons-grade plutonium, which Hunt lost in a botched deal intended to sniff out Lark. With a cloud of failure hovering over his head, the CIA intervenes and pairs the IMF veteran with bruiser assassin August Walker (Cavill), who prefers punching baddies’ heads over interrogating them for answers.  Aided by Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames), and later Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust, who returns from Rogue Nation with unfinished business, Fallout follows the Mission: Impossible beats as Hunt’s IMF squad delves deeper and deeper into the criminal underbelly — and rips off plenty of face masks in the process — to uncover the answers it needs before the clock ticks its final tock.  McQuarrie engineers the franchise’s simplest plot with the most complicated heist plans. The movie’s keystone sequence, a prisoner extraction set in the streets of Paris, involves a foot-soldier ambush, car-smashing stunts, multiple motorcycle chases and an unexpected coda of unnerving, close-proximity gunplay. Fear is the backbone of Fallout, summoned in the grand possibilities of nuclear holocaust and the gushing blood of an untreatable wound. It’s a movie that knows just how to turn the dramatic knife to maximize pain. I don’t want to make Fallout sound too delicate. While the movie treats espionage as a tango, McQuarrie rivals Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol’s layered, large-scale visuals, with Cruise as the Wile E. Coyote answer to James Bond. A simple HALO-jump-to-the-landing-point operation becomes aerial hell as an electrical storm comes barreling through Ethan and August’s trajectory. The much-touted helicopter duel — which the trailers have obfuscated and preserved through trick editing, and which I certainly won’t spoil the beats of here — is shot in IMAX, which creates distance, momentum and diesel-laced sweat that practically splashes off the screen. And while every M:I movie gives Cruise the chance to run, Fallout takes the athleticism to new heights. Specifically, to high-rise rooftops, where the star bursts across the London horizon like a T-1000 playing QWOP. McQuarrie beats the living shit out of Cruise because Cruise can take it. Though Fallout is one gasp-worthy stunt after the next, McQuarrie treats Ethan Hunt more like a rag doll than a superhero action figure, letting his face turn tomato-red and his blood vessels pop as he screams “NONONONO!” during every close call. The brutality is crucial to the movie’s meta success. Cruise is our most complicated movie star. Each time he throws himself into a new project — literally, in the case of the Mission: Impossible sequels — we’re forced to weigh his relentless commitment and charisma against a history of troubling off-screen behavior. McQuarrie’s relentless pace vacuum seals the experience of watching Fallout, as does the self-deprecating performance Cruise has been honing since Edge of Tomorrow (a movie McQuarrie rewrote for him). Mission: Impossible - Fallout has its flaws: It’s slow to ascend, flimsy in more dramatic moments that hope we’re invested in long-term relationships, and a little too “Nolan-esque” for its own good (the worst offense: Lorne Balfe’s Hans Zimmer-lite score). But McQuarrie’s movie also seems aware, confident that minor sacrifices are what it takes to make set pieces pop, clever gags suspend our disbelief, and end this six-episode series with a bang. While it’s not official, Mission: Impossible - Fallout feels like the grand finale of a mission that started in 1996 — complete with references to Brian de Palma’s original. Ethan Hunt is old. Tom Cruise is old! How many more times can the singular persona evade machine gun fire, crash a motorcycle, get up, then save the world? Fallout feels like the answer, and yet, Ethan Hunt can’t say no. Neither can we. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," Apologetically plonked at the end of the September release schedule like a $100m afterthought, Gareth Edwards' The Creator is a movie that does a lot with a little, although that should be no surprise to anyone familiar with the director's prudent knack of making movies that look twice as expensive as they actually are. His first movie since Star Wars spin-off Rogue One - that rare Disney-era Star Wars feature that is universally beloved - Edwards finds himself back on imperious form, crafting a zeitgeisty tale about the dangers of A.I. that couldn't be more timely if it were written by ChatGPT itself. You may have noticed that film reviews, or indeed content of any kind, has been few and far between on the ridiculous pages of this site recently, but every now and then a film comes along that is so powerful, so commanding of the cultural zeitgeist, that it just simply can’t be ignored. This is that film. Jackass Forever is a movie that provides the relief we so desperately need following two years of global hardship. It’s a solution for the general societal malaise from which we’re all suffering. It might even hold the cure for the coronavirus itself. And all it took was a lot of dicks and balls getting hit, bitten, stung and punched. People sure like to bitch about Marvel movies, huh? You've got the usual Film Twitter snobs, writing them off as ""films for children"". You've got the hard nerd right, who never met a female character they couldn't belittle. You've got the cinema purists, claiming they represent everything wrong with cinema and that Disney are sounding the death knell for the industry. We are now, what, 24 movies into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I'm not checking, I refuse to check) and it's never been easier to write a review of a Marvel movie - just reapply the same argument you did on the previous 23 films, file copy, commence smugness. People like to say the Marvel production line creates ""cookie-cutter"" movies, like that's somehow a bad thing. What, you don't like fucking cookies now? Enjoy your gluten-free artisanal crackers you tedious bores, because Black Widow is a triple-chocolate chunk cookie of a movie and it goes down real easy. Is there any point in bothering to review a film like Fast & Furious 9? Its very existence is a middle finger to anyone who genuinely considers themselves to be a 'film critic' - even its title feels like the sort of cute background gag you'd see in Back To The Future II, a sly crack at Hollywood's over-reliance on familiar formula. Let me rephrase my original question: is there any point in me bothering to review a film like Fast & Furious 9? The answer is yes, thank you very much, because I haven't reviewed a film since 2019 and I couldn't imagine booking an easier comeback gig. It's a big stupid target for someone like me to take cheap potshots at and at the same time feel good about myself for ultimately giving it a positive review, as per the will of the people. Everybody wins! Except the criminals. Coming right in the final throes of a horribly unheroic year, the long-awaited sequel of the best reviewed film of the DCEU - and the only true superhero movie to be released in 2020 - should be a slam dunk. Tenet aside, the year has been utterly devoid of blockbuster spectacle and we haven’t been able to measure our cinematic expectations in major franchise instalments like we normally would, resorting instead to counting Netflix hits and misses. So, whether it’s being watched at an IMAX or on an iPad, Wonder Woman 1984 really couldn’t have hoped for a more receptive audience. Sadly, any assumptions that this would guarantee a great movie experience is purely wishful thinking.  How do you lift the veil from someone who doesn't care what people think of them? This is the challenge facing Sacha Baron Cohen as he resurrects his Borat character, 14 years after the first film, in an attempt to snare the big figures of American politics prior to the upcoming election. The knowingly flimsy premise for this return is a meta plot in which Borat has now become so famous he has to continue his interview series in disguise - a process he's putting himself through in order to deliver a gift to U S. Vice President Michael Pence, otherwise he faces execution back home. Although you'd be mistaken for thinking Borat had turned up dead already. Here are a couple of film facts you can use to impress your TikTok audience: Die Hard is a Christmas movie, and John Carpenter's The Thing is a remake. Wait, one of the most awesome movies ever is a copy of another film? Well no, not exactly: Carpenter took an old story and improved it, adding his own ideas and explosions, and generally raising everything up a notch. Okay, so what's your point? That it is possible to create legitimate new art from old art. Oh right, is it worth obsessing over? Not really. Are you going to anyway? Yes, after this dab. I was reading some comments under the Lily James gossip stuff recently, and someone said they couldn't tell the difference between James, Emma Roberts and Lily Allen. Lily Allen? But she's a singer, not an actress. And then I realised the person was an American and only knew her from films, not Top of the Pops. And then it got me thinking about initial impressions of people, and how I could work that into this review, before realising it's actually Lily Collins in the film and not Lily James. So my point is there are too many women. It was cruel, really - to give us a glimpse of an oft-quoted character from Adam Sandler's greatest creation, Happy Gilmore, and then to undo any hint a comedy of that calibre would be in store mere seconds later when the funny voices and scat humour kicked in. And this is a film obsessed with scat: farts, poo, piss, it's got it all. Which is apt, because I've never seen anything go to shit as quickly as Hubie Halloween. English people sound one of three ways in Hollywood films: grubby urchin begging for a crumb of bread, Hugh Grant being wanked off by a malfunctioning robot, and Sherlock Holmes. Having been an English person for nearly forty years and travelled most of the country, I have never met a single person who sounds like any of them. Obviously I'm not tossing off enough floppy toffs. But just because we don't sound that way doesn't mean we don't think like it - which I'm about to handily prove by adopting my finest Sherlock big posho internal monologue for a review of Enola Holmes, what what!",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018","With impeccable stuntwork and crisp direction, Fallout delivers intense and thrilling set pieces that pack a punch with a weight and realism that few other blockbusters can match.",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," Tom Cruise, who has proven to be an accomplished and interesting actor in the right parts, uses the IMF agent Ethan Hunt to remind us he is also a super big movie star. As charming and charismatic as ever, Cruise, now just a bit wider in his mid-50’s, is also as fully committed.  Still performing his own stunts (you’d think producer Cruise would have a talk with lemme-at-it Cruise), we spend half the film not just marveling at his physical ability but also wondering how in the hell he does all that. Of course, an on set accident, which happened while Cruise was leaping a tall building, made international headlines. Pro tip: keep your eyes peeled. The scene is actually in the movie and you and your friends can make a wager on who’s going to catch it first. Speaking of leaping tall buildings, Superman Henry Cavill joins the returning gang, which includes Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg, Rebecca Ferguson and Alec Baldwin. No spoilers, but suffice it to say that Cavill’s initially stiff performance heats up after he gets to throw some quite impressive punches. There are tons of punches. And chases. And a spectacular helicopter pas de deux that defies both gravity and logic. Much of the story here does, too. Hunt’s mission, which, of course, he accepts, has something to do with saving the world from a madman threatening global nuclear destruction. Unfortunate as the timing on that conceit is, bringing just a touch of today’s headlines into the mix, the rest of the film glides along merrily, taking us on a don’t-ask-too-many-questions, gleefully dizzy, breathtakingly entertaining and terrifically crafted escapist ride. See it on the biggest screen you can. The scenery, stunts and effects don’t just fill every corner, but even after nearly two and half hours, leave us revved up and ready for more.",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," The key word for this franchise is not “impossible”. Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his team always find a way. It’s “mission” because these films are all about the job. Ethan Hunt barely ever pauses to let his love life interfere with his work, nor does he take time to swot up on his wine knowledge or choose a new bespoke suit. But each time he chooses a mission, what follows steadily are adrenalin-triggering exploits, loosely strung together by double-crosses and chicanery. And at the heart of it is the biggest movie star on the planet, still, a man who risks life and limb each time he steps up, to accomplish stunts we’ve never seen. Tom Cruise probably climbs the Cliffs Of Insanity before breakfast and rappels back down using his own discarded M hair. He’s sort of breathtaking. The plot sees Hunt face a terrifying nuclear threat from the acolytes of imprisoned anarchist baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris, still on supremely creepy form). Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust crosses his path again, on a conflicting mission of her own, while CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill, with moustache) is foisted on Hunt as a minder. He’s a hammer to Hunt’s scalpel, as CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) puts it, and despite the effectiveness of their partnership the two immediately clash. But while the cast are superb and writer/director Christopher McQuarrie’s character scenes quick but effective — Hunt’s personal life gets perhaps ten minutes in total here, though that packs a punch — the film comes alive in its jaw-droppingly effective action. There are car chases, fist fights, rooftop races and a helicopter pursuit against stunning scenery. But such descriptions don’t do them justice: this Paris set-piece is a car chase in the same way that Mad Max: Fury Road is basically a car chase. A bathroom brawl becomes a visceral, bruising struggle to the death. McQuarrie and Cruise push each scene a little further than you think they can, adding an unexpected flourish or upping the stakes in a way that feels fresh, so that you can never quite predict Hunt’s limits. If the first hour seems a little slow in retrospect, that’s only in comparison to a virtually flawless finale. It’s also really clever. The villainous plot to use the nukes, and Hunt’s response, more-or-less makes sense, as with any of these films. But what’s deeply satisfying is the way that McQuarrie layers character moments in the unlikeliest ways: bonding over bomb defusion, or an expression of purest trust when faced with the highest stakes imaginable. Even an escape by boat becomes a moment of delightful ingenuity, and a celebration of Hunt’s ability to plan his way past the creaking limits of his own endurance (and Cruise isn’t scared to show physical and emotional vulnerability here, even as he pushes himself back to his feet and goes after his target for the umpteenth time). Every Mission: Impossible film and TV episode poses its hero the same offer: “Your mission, should you choose to accept it…” is as close as the series comes to having a catchphrase. Here, McQuarrie finally asks what sort of man keeps accepting those missions; what drives someone to put their life on the line again and again? For Hunt, the answer is simple. He can save people, and therefore he has a responsibility to act. For Cruise — and McQuarrie — it’s an eternal quest to outdo the last effort. They’re only making the next one difficult by succeeding this hard.",POSITIVE

"Jul 13, 2018"," Why you can trust GamesRadar+ 


Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. There have been five previous Mission: Impossible movies, each fashioned by a different director who’s been actively encouraged to bring his signature style to the franchise (hiring a female filmmaker seems to be the most impossible mission of all). Fallout breaks from this admirable quest for freshness, with Christopher McQuarrie, the director of fifth installment Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation, returning to the chair, perhaps indicating that producer/star Tom Cruise is this time ready to play it safe. No chance. The trick here is that McQuarrie – “McQ” to his leading man, whom he also directed in Jack Reacher – has no interest in repeating the elegant storytelling and suspenseful set-pieces that brought such old-school sophistication to Rogue Nation. Fallout, as the title suggests, is a more sprawling, robust, chaotic affair, crashing from Belfast to Berlin to Paris to London to Kashmir in a flurry of visceral action sequences that punctuate a narrative so twisty it doesn’t so much spin heads as snap necks. The plot, should you choose to try and keep up, involves our IMF hero Ethan Hunt (Cruise) being given 72 measly hours to grab three nuclear cores that are on their way to The Apostles, a splinter cell of terrorists set up by Rogue Nation baddie Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Hunt and his trusted teammates Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg, who this time gets to fire machine guns, scuba dive and more) botch the job with terrible consequences: nukes go off in Rome, Jerusalem and Mecca. And so Hunt goes into action again, this time accompanied by CIA watchdog Walker (Henry Cavill, all muscles, malignancy and moustache), who's presumably named after Point Blank’s similarly implacable antihero played by Lee Marvin. Hunt’s first task is to cosy up to arms dealer White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), and then… well, best you take the corkscrew journey for yourselves to discover how the dizzying plot accommodates players old (Harris’ anarchist Lane, Rebecca Ferguson’s MI6 agent Elsa, Alec Baldwin’s government honcho Alan Hunley) and new (Angela Basset’s CIA chief Erica Sloan, Liang Yang’s fist-flinging terrorist, Kristoffer Joner’s nuclear-weapons expert Nils Debruuk). There are double, triple, quadruple crosses… Whenever Ethan mutters “I’ll figure it out,” he’s referring to the perilous stunts he has to tackle on the fly (literally, in a couple of cases), but viewers might wish to apply his amusing catchphrase to the thrillingly clever story. But we mentioned stunts and… wow, just wow. Impossibly dangerous set-pieces have always been this franchise’s mission, with M:I’s chopper-in-the-Chunnel collision, M:I - 2’s cliff-face dangle, M:1 - 3’s bridge battle, M:I - 4’s Burj Khalifa climb and M:I - 5’s plane-clinging takeoff raising the bar for action cinema. Well, M:I - 6 serves up belter after corker, from a stomach-knotting HALO jump to knuckle-whitening motorbike and car chases to Cruise, the greatest sprinter in the movies, pumping those arms and legs to propel himself up, around and over St. Paul’s Cathedral, then past Tower Bridge and up to the very summit of the Tate Modern. Hollywood's leading man does it all himself, naturally, even breaking an ankle during one full-pelt leap between rooftops, and he also – madly, unbelievably – stunt-pilots a chopper in a truly kamikaze pursuit. Add in a fair amount of humour and some exploratory emotion as Hunt, hitherto a cipher, gets to exhibit a little soul beneath the superspy, and you have, improbably, the finest Mission yet. You’d be crazy not to accept it. Jamie Graham is the Editor-at-Large of Total Film magazine.

"Jul 13, 2018"," More like Mission: Impressive. It will be hard for any other action movie this year to top the superb staging, extraordinary stunt work and sheer exhilaration marshalled by writer/director Christopher McQuarrie in the sixth astonishing instalment of the Tom Cruise-fronted franchise. Uniquely the only director to return to the fold (after Rogue Nation in 2015), McQuarrie steers the testosterone-drenched, explosive espionage extravaganza into unusually stately recesses, further electrified by a ramping up of narrative depth, absorbing character gravitas and awe-inspiring ambition. Perhaps the only IMF escapade where you do really need to know your Ethan Hunt history because many past story threads interconnect with major impact on Fallout’s main frame, it’s no accident that the iconic self-destruct tape that usually initiates Hunt’s assignments is here contained within a copy of Homer’s The Odyssey. In an extended pre-credits scene-setter, Hunt (Cruise) and his buddy operatives – laconic Luther (Ving Rhames) and ever-panicky Benji (Simon Pegg) – mess up an undercover purchase of illegal plutonium, putting it back out on the covert market. As Hunt refused to put his friends’ lives at risk during the recovery mission, CIA head honcho Erica Stone (Angela Bassett) insists her agent, August Walker (Henry Cavill), babysits all future operations, which includes Hunt posing as mysterious international terrorist John Lark to buy the plutonium back before a doomsday scenario erupts. But the new owners of the stolen nuclear material are the Apostles and they don’t want money, just the return of their incarcerated leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). He’s the psycho MI6 agent who migrated to the dark side in Rogue Nation and joined the Syndicate’s crusade to cause global catastrophe and trigger a new world order. So, Hunt must intercept Lane’s armoured car journey before desperate superpowers get to interrogate him and then broker a swap through socialite arms dealer, the White Widow (played by The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby). Add in double-cross, MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) with her own lethal agenda, double-double-cross, IMF champion Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), judicious use of rubber mask disguises, Hunt’s ex-wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) hiding in plain sight, a ticking time-bomb countdown on suspense steroids, and you have another twisty, epic helping of strikingly stylish daredevil delights. While there are no prizes for guessing exactly who John Lark really is, there’s still a lot going on in McQuarrie’s densely plotted race against time so it’s sometimes hard to keep up with all the myriad assassins and former allies jostling for attention. No matter. What people want to see is Cruise giving his personal insurers yet more heart attacks by throwing himself off buildings, dangling from helicopters and plunging into mountain ravines. Here, the incredibly fit Cruise Halo-jumps through a lightning storm, masterminds a fender-level car chase through congested Paris and a breakneck motorcycle chicken run anti-clockwise around the Arc de Triomphe, super-sprints through St Paul’s Cathedral via Blackfriars Station to the Tate Modern in London and ends the whole kamikaze craziness with what must be one of the most spectacular cliffhanger stunts ever filmed, a sensational helicopter battle over snowy mountainous terrain ratcheting up the nail-biting tension to new stratospheric heights. Clearly raising the bar for action cinema in the same way as Mad Max: Fury Road, the movie’s eyes-on-stalks amazement is palpable. Nor must one forget the stunning martial arts fight in a gents toilet that proves visceral innovation isn’t only confined to the more grandiose moments. Cruise is exceptional in the derring-do department, of course, going for broke in ways few 56-year-olds would try and now fits his role like a well-worn glove. He did actually end up in hospital with a fractured ankle thanks to one stunt escapade, another example of the total dedication to his craft that earns him kudos few stars of his stature ever receive. There’s a decent amount of backstory to get to grips with, too, especially in the romantic areas where the similarity between Ilsa and Julia becomes ever-more evident. Not only has Cruise become better with each successive instalment, the actual movies have matched him all the way by pushing their pop culture durability and extreme escapism boundaries with polish and élan. Long may that topping-the-one-before, enthralling knuckle-whitening tradition continue. For now, this fast-moving, engrossing and gripping mega-thrill ride, despite being the longest to date, lays claim to being the best in the series and a transcendent kinetic pleasure you will simply be powerless to resist.",POSITIVE

"Jul 13, 2018"," Yes, it is that time again, time for Tom Cruise to become tireless secret agent Ethan Hunt, a man whose mission, should he choose to accept it (as if he had a choice) is to be the implacable enemy of all things evil in the world, our last line of defense against the apocalypse. “Mission Impossible — Fallout” is the sixth “MI” adventure for Cruise since the film was first spun off from the Bruce Geller-created TV series in 1996. And this latest entertaining iteration, written and directed by Christopher McQuarrie, returning from the previous “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” is shrewd enough to take advantage of that longevity, and not just by replaying the celebrated Lalo Schifrin theme at key moments. McQuarrie has brought back numerous familiar characters from the entire range of previous films, including Ving Rhames, sidekick Luther since the 1996 original, wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) from “Mission: Impossible III” and more recent “Rogue Nation” additions such as fellow secret agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and implacable anarchist threat Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Though it seems like an odd analogy for such an action-heavy film, these familiar faces, and the emotional connections we’ve formed with their characters over the years, make “Mission Impossible — Fallout” the thriller version of comfort film. It’s something we can return to with complete confidence in what we’re getting into. However, as McQuarrie, Cruise and veteran stunt coordinator and second unit director Wade Eastwood well know, it is the action set pieces even more than the familiar faces that keep fans returning to the franchise, and the desire to always one-up the previous installment has clearly been on everyone’s mind. In fact, as Cruise ages (he turned 56 on July 3), his ability to continue to do all his own stunts becomes remarkable, even if it leads to mishaps such as a production-stopping broken foot while “Fallout” was being filmed. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” does have a plot, and such a complex one that the film’s running time is a hefty two hours and 27 minutes. This is a film that wants you to live in the moment, to enjoy what is on screen when it is there in front of you and not worry how it fits into a plot that can be confusing but clears up in time for the inevitably rousing conclusion. “Fallout” opens with Hunt receiving the usual self-destructing message, this time warning of a shadowy group called the Apostles, a syndicate of rogue anarchists who want to get hold of a trio of stolen plutonium cores so they can blow up a chunk of the globe and cause as much chaos as possible. Hunt and his posse of Luther and Benji (Simon Pegg) try to get their hands on said plutonium, but a choice he makes doesn’t end well. It’s the fallout from that, as well as the nuclear kind, that gives the film its title. Getting involved in a variety of ways are Hunt’s boss Alan Hunley (Alex Baldwin), CIA director Erika Sloane (Angela Bassett) and her assassin of choice, August Walker (Henry Cavill) — a hammer, she says, to Hunt’s scalpel. And lest we forget, there’s the beautiful but deadly Ilsa, and a new character, the evocatively named but amoral White Widow, engagingly played by Vanessa Kirby, fresh from being Princess Margaret on “The Crown.” Though the Apostles get a lot of early ink, “Fallout’s” bad guys turn out to be the returning Lane and the mysterious John Lark, who wrote a nihilistic manifesto paradoxically insisting, “the greater the suffering, the greater the peace.” All this end-of-the-world talk is somehow soothing if we know Ethan Hunt is around to keep the peace, and we well understand the frustration of a bad guy who hisses at him, “Why won’t you just die.” He just won’t, that’s why, and 2018’s summer movie season is the better for it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," Some things are synonymous with action, and two of them are part of this movie: Mission Impossible and Tom Cruise. His career has spanned decades, and he continues to impress with his acting ability and insistence upon doing his stunts for his films. The latest Mission Impossible film, Mission Impossible: Fallout finds Ethan Hunt working to save the world once again. A group of radicals called the Apostles, who is determined to destroy the world and restore peace. While working to stop these maniacs, he is forced to work with CIA agent, August Walker (Henry Cavill) on the orders of Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett), director of the CIA. While pursuing this group, they come in contact with Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and Ethan is put in a very interesting position. As part of the mission to take down this organization and stop a worldwide attack, he has to work with The White Widow (Vanessa Kirby), an arms dealer and broker who hides behind her philanthropic endeavors. By working with her, he can hopefully prevent a catastrophic event and save the world once again.  Most of the Mission Impossible films are incredibly entertaining and full of action. Tom Cruise is easily the most significant action star of all-time and continues to showcase his talents with these films. The action in the film was incredibly tense and fascinating to watch. Christopher McQuarrie does fantastically working to create some amazing action scenes with stellar visuals.  Tom Cruise, as usual, is wonderful to watch and epitomizes what an action star is. Having Henry Cavill join the film was interesting. I think that their characters were different enough that it was enjoyable, but I don’t know how much they let Henry act. I feel like a lot of the performance was less than his best, but maybe it was because of the character he was given. We get a glimpse of the fight scene in the bathroom in the trailer of the film, and it certainly doesn’t disappoint in the film. Their chemistry together was pretty decent, but it still felt a bit off somehow. Simon Pegg, as usual, kills in this role. I don’t know what it is, but this role just suits him so well. Ving Rhames gives a solid performance and has excellent chemistry with Pegg. The two standout performances for me were Rebecca Ferguson and Vanessa Kirby. Their characters were compelling and multifaceted. It was drastically different than seeing Vanessa Kirby in The Crown or Rebecca Ferguson in The Greatest Showman, but I appreciate seeing them in radically different roles.  Where the problems arise for me is right from the beginning of the film. While the opening scene set a very high standard, I felt that it was very slow to get into what the crux of the story is. With the overabundance of characters, which you need to follow, and jumping from place to place, it all feels a little jumbled at the beginning of the film resulting in the audience being unable to enjoy it thoroughly. Another issue that arises is that the story is relatively predictable. You see a lot of the twists coming, and it lessens the impact of the story.  In combination with the predictability of the story, the middle of the film starts to drag, and you begin to feel that two-hour and twenty-seven-minute runtime very heavily. Despite these issues, the final 45 minutes of the film are phenomenal and entirely make up for the rest of the film. The atmosphere is very tense and nail-biting as we watch a helicopter chase, many different physical altercations, and a race to beat the clock and save the world. Even with its faults, Mission Impossible: Fallout delights the audience with the over-the-top excitement and armrest gripping action. The cheese factor rears its head just enough to get the audience the laughs it needs to round out the film and make it a truly enjoyable experience. Mission Impossible: Fallout is a solid addition to an already superb franchise and continues to solidify Tom Cruise as the biggest action star of the century.",POSITIVE
"Jul 13, 2018"," Mission: Impossible - Fallout’s set-pieces still pack plenty of punch and give the viewer their money’s worth, but the film seems to acknowledge that we’ve all been down this road many times before. It never quite improves upon or distinguishes itself from previous entries in the decades-old franchise, but seeing Tom Cruise perform the Impossible still entertains.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","  Mission: Impossible - Fallout is going to blow audiences out of their chairs. The sixth installment of the franchise is an action juggernaut. Christopher Mcquarrie (The Way of the Gun, Jack Reacher), who also wrote and directed Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation, returns with rocket fuel in his veins. He raises his own bar with a beautifully shot, absolutely epic adventure. McQuarrie threads the films together, bringing back bygone characters to a new narrative. His story adds feeling to the bullets and beatdowns. Tom Cruise chose the right man to helm the Mission Impossible ship.   Two years after Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), a splinter faction of his Syndicate emerges. The Apostles are anarchists bent on nuclear terrorism. Led by a shadowy figure, they have seemingly infiltrated the US intelligence apparatus. When stolen, weapons grade plutonium hits the black market; the IMF must get to it before the Apostles. But they are hardly the only players in this deadly game. The CIA demands to take part in the operation. Hunt is forced to bring along August Walker (Henry Cavill). Where Ethan Hunt is a scalpel, August Walker is a sledgehammer. The men must overcome their differences before the Apostles catastrophic plan comes to fruition.   Mission Impossible: Fallout wastes no time. The first ten minutes has more exposition than most movies. McQuarrie establishes the characters, their objectives, and takes off without ever looking back. The overall storyline of the plutonium has multiple subplots. There's mystery, espionage, and numerous characters engaging in subterfuge. McQuarrie places trust in Hunt's unshakeable allies. Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) have a lot of screen time. At this point, the IMF regulars are known commodities. McQuarrie uses the team dynamic wisely. They provide the emotional backbone when characters we haven't seen for a while return to the story.   The action scenes are stupefyingly awesome. Mission Impossible: Fallout is a near overdose for the action junkie. McQuarrie takes a cinematic eye to his approach. The dialogue scenes have a grainy texture indicative of the murky villains. The action however is crisp, vibrant, brilliantly filmed and staged. Cinematographer Rob Hardy (Ex Machina, Annihilation) does an incredible job, truly Oscar worthy. The helicopter climax, and I write this without hyperbole, is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed. It was shot for IMAX and looks freaking spectacular in that format. Jaw dropping is an understatement.   The mystery surrounding the leader of the Apostles is overblown. The characters jump through a whole lot of hoops and double crosses to find the villain. The baddie is fairly obvious, but that's not a deal killer for the plot. The antagonist is not the only surprise. McQuarrie does a great job sprinkling reveals throughout. It makes the sixth go round more lucid and meaningful than the previous missions. I've pretty much liked the entire franchise, but Rogue Nation and Fallout are bookends to a fantastic story. The two films together elevate Mission Impossible and truly sets the stage for quality sequels.   From Paramount Pictures, Mission Impossible: Fallout is a must see. Tom Cruise and the IMF are better than ever. Christopher McQuarrie has delivered action greatness. I cannot wait for a second viewing. Shell out for the IMAX if you can. The helicopter scene is worth the price of admission by itself.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. The MMA fighter will make his acting debut in the reimagining for Prime Video, but Hollywood was courting him long before Doug Liman came along.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","Two and a half hours of non-stop insanely well shot, choreographed and performed action sequences. Christopher McQuarrie continues to solidify Mission: Impossible as one of the best action franchises out there.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," The MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE franchise is a rare bird: It’s actually getting better as it gets older. Though the initial installments were commercial successes, they were on shaky ground in terms of critical appeal. But the studio nurtured it with time and money, and now we have fantastic tentpole movies that deliver on more than their initial promise. Writer-Director Christopher McQuarrie’s MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT has everything you’d want in a summer movie (or any movie, for that matter): Big cinematic spectacle, meaningful character stakes, edge-of-your-seat action sequences and a badass ensemble on both sides of the camera. It’s awe-inducing, flawless workmanship, a technical triumph, and quite possibly a masterpiece – and not just in terms of the spy-thriller genre. McQuarrie crafts a solid narrative that deals with something we don’t often see sneaking up on our beloved heroes: consequences. It’s been two years since the events of ROGUE NATION, and IMF agent extraordinaire Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his skilled squad – Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) – haven’t been resting on their laurels. The disciples of the crime syndicate leader Ethan captured, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), have formed an extremist cell plotting to destroy the current world order. But when Ethan botches the mission to prevent plutonium from falling into the wrong hands, he and his team are forced into an even higher-stakes undercover game of cat-and-mouse. His task is made more complicated by CIA assassin August Walker (Henry Cavill), who’s been assigned by CIA Director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to essentially babysit Ethan. Also, ex-flame/ ex-MI-6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) shows up – and she’s got a different directive. The auteur makes sure to weave the theme tightly into the film’s fabric. Whether it be narratively, audibly or visually, the aftereffects of Ethan’s split-second, occasionally careless decisions are evident in every element of the picture. The protagonist’s inner turmoil is fueled by guilt and grief over previous failures, and McQuarrie fully explores this conflict through the house of cards being built. He’s forced to question the ramification of his actions time and time again. We see nuanced glints of this weighing on an emotionally-compromised, doubting hero within the facets of Cruise’s performance – which is his best in the series. The characters’ emotional drive remains at the forefront of all the pulsating, riveting action sequences. The indelible HALO jump and the midair helicopter rope climb are astounding sights, but an even more breathtaking sequence is the knock-down, drag-out fight in the Palais’ men’s room, where Hunt and Walker tussle with a suspected baddie. Here, Jeffrey Kurland’s costume design, Rob Hardy’s cinematography, Peter Wenham’s production design, Eddie Hamilton’s editing, and the work of the fight choreographers and sound designers all sing in glorious harmony. Hunt and Walker’s charcoal grey and black suits clash beautifully against the stark, bright white luminosity of the walls and floors. The suspect’s grey suit hints at his ambiguous nature. McQuarrie and Hardy employ angles and Steadicam movement that show off the tight quarters in and out of a stall. Setting the scene without the use of a traditional score – letting the sound design of punches, grunts, broken mirrors and hits taken through walls eclipse the audience –heightens the atmospheric tension. It’s a thing of beauty. That said, the pièce de résistance is McQuarrie’s outstanding finale. It’s imperative that other creatives take notes on how he keeps several plates spinning for a sustained period of time. The ticking clock scenario will leave you buzzing with excitement. He sections it off into four big parts and splinters them into smaller, even more pressing pieces, whilst making it all feel urgent and immediate. This is also where the women of this world are given standout moments to shine, demonstrating their mental and physical acumen. Aesthetically and sonically, McQuarrie, Hardy, Wenham and composer Lorne Balfe vividly deconstruct what aftermath looks and sounds like. Circles are a prevalent motif, accentuating Ethan’s ongoing “full circle” experience. It’s peppered in subtly, seen in the roundabout in Paris, the church in London, and more. Alongside the polished, brightly lit sequences, Hardy turns in breathtaking low-light work in “The White Widow” Alana’s (Vanessa Kirby) office and club, and in the London underground cellar. He and McQuarrie occasionally will favor capturing the corollary minutes of  “Golden Hour” lighting in the “Blue Hour.” Balfe’s score delights the senses. The heartrending, melancholic notes of the string section during Ethan’s introspection hit like a wallop. Later, its percussive tones set the foundation for the climax, emphasizing the building dramatics. McQuarrie finds plenty of moments to favor the symphonic poetry of Balfe’s work over the rat-a-tat-tat of gunfire, enveloping the audience on another level. Perhaps the greatest magic trick McQuarrie pulls off – with stylish panache and substantial gusto – is the least evident. Each MISSION has an unspoken, yet distinguishable checklist: We know Ethan’s gonna go rogue and that his boss isn’t going to trust him. We know there will be double-crosses along the way. We know the team will be tested. The brilliance is McQuarrie makes sure to dazzle us, cloaking the expected in the unexpected, thus birthing a welcomed evolution.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","Thrilling and action packed, Tom Cruise and Christopher McQuarrie have set the platinum standard by which every action film that comes after Fallout will be measured.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","All of their derring-do is choreographed, shot, and acted in a way that looks real, in a way that puts most of this summer's other action-adventure blockbusters to shame.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," The Mission: Impossible franchise has gone from strength to strength in its last couple of entries, with the fifth entry Rogue Nation taking proceedings to sometimes ludicrous but also slick and stylish levels of cinematic escapism (the opera scene in particular springs to mind). The plot is suitably bombastic and ludicrous and exactly the sort of fare we’d expect - nuclear warheads, double cross upon double cross, underground organisations - and of course Cruise’s Ethan Hunt is right there in the centre of it, bringing Cruise’s trademark physicality and charisma. Hunt’s sheer likability always rested on Cruise’s soldiers, this isn’t a deep character piece, but he is the anchor of the spectacle and the hero that is so easy to root for. Franchise regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames bring their usual humour, but in a non-overbearing manner. In Rhames’ case, he gets to showcase some real heart too. Alec Baldwin is underused but when he is, he offers satisfying scenes. The women of the film are some real standouts though. Rebecca Ferguson’s breakout role from the last film - the enigmatic and brilliantly named Ilsa Faust - continues to play a suitably unpredictable role in proceedings. Angela Bassett brings her trademark sass, while The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby impresses as a terrifically sultry arms dealer known as The White Widow. Sean Harris’ subtly satanic Solomon Lane from the previous film is back to wreak havoc, promising to take from Hunt all that he cares about - allowing a return for Michelle Monaghan who actually gets more to do than be the damsel in distress. Once again the stakes are global, the car chases furious, the stunts jaw-dropping, and the fight scenes perfectly choreographed. It’s a non-stop rollercoaster ride of suspense and tension, that takes itself seriously to the extent it’s hard not to get swept up in it, but self-aware enough that the corniest lines and moments never feel too silly. The Man of Steel himself, Henry Cavill, will likely be a big talking point of the film as Agent Walker, as a partner in crime for Hunt who has a particular skill set of his own. Rest assured though, while perhaps having the hardest role, Cavill provided more meaty scenes than he has ever been allowed to do as Superman.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Tom Cruise continues to defy Father Time in this electrifying installment of the ‘Mission: Impossible’ franchise, one of the greatest action films of the decade. Tom Cruise takes the title of his Mission: Impossible franchise as a literal challenge. With each successive installment, Cruise attempts to demonstrate that no classic set piece can’t be topped and that, no matter his advancing age (56), he can keep ignoring (if not outright fighting) Father Time to pull off ever-greater acts of stuntman insanity, at crazy risk to his personal safety. That’s never more true than with Fallout, his sixth outing as covert agent Ethan Hunt, which reconfirms that his inspired-by-TV endeavor is still the greatest blockbuster saga around, and that he’s Hollywood’s premiere action-adventure Peter Pan, an actor who—regardless of his spottier track record as of late—is right at home in this world of spies, masks and self-destructing messages. Determined to perpetually raise the bar for both the series and himself, Cruise again proves, with his latest, that both of those seemingly impossible feats is possible. Fallout is the best action film since Mad Max: Fury Road, and it’s unique in the big-screen history of Mission: Impossible, in that it’s the first episode to be helmed by a return director—Christopher McQuarrie, who spearheaded 2015’s stellar Rogue Nation. For an undertaking once defined by its shifting personality—thanks to each entry being a stand-alone effort from a distinctive auteur (Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird)—the decision to reenlist McQuarrie signifies that Cruise has settled on a signature voice for his series. Not only does McQuarrie deliver the same style of grand, vigorous mayhem that he did before, but working as sole screenwriter, he also turns Fallout into a legitimate sequel to its immediate predecessor, continuing the story he began three years ago—while additionally, in one key respect, referencing Abrams’ Mission: Impossible III. The decision to go back to McQuarrie does negate the thrill of discovering a new aesthetic and tone, which up until now has been a Mission: Impossible hallmark. Nonetheless, what’s gained is far greater—a refinement of McQuarrie’s superb action form. Fallout features more astounding set pieces than can be found in the rest of 2018’s summer crop combined, all of which escalate with such mounting electricity that it’s hard to catch one’s breath. The director’s stunning widescreen visuals (even more impressive in IMAX, whose outsized format is repeatedly exploited) enhance the magnificence of his scripting and staging, in which initially straightforward scenarios become complicated by a raft of unforeseen events, until the tension is almost too much to bear. In terms of providing a pure adrenalized rush, almost no contemporaries are in its league. That Cruise’s Hunt routinely responds to surprising situations with “I’ll figure it out” only amplifies the anxious anticipation of Fallout’s big moments, of which there are many. During a two-against-one bathroom brawl, one half-expects the screen to tear apart from all the muscularity on display. A motorcycle and car chase through the streets of Paris is marked by McQuarrie and cinematographer Rob Hardy’s up-close-and-personal shots of Hunt and Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust speeding through oncoming traffic, the camera zooming in and around their faces at death-defying speeds. Those urban vehicular sequences are arguably the finest committed to film since John Frankenheimer’s 1998 Ronin, and would be the standout passages in any other studio tentpole. Yet saving the best for last (another series first!), McQuarrie outdoes them with his finale, in which Cruise climbs a rope dangling from the bottom of an airborne helicopter, climbs inside and takes control of the craft, and then pursues another chopper—which he tries to ram, mid-air. Fallout’s climactic aerial showdown is one for the ages, a master class in brawny ticking-time-bomb suspense that benefits from the fact that Cruise is, you know, actually dangling from that helicopter! The star’s commitment to putting his own health on the line to achieve such stunts is mad—and, unsurprisingly, resulted in a production-halting broken ankle during one rooftop leap that’s included in the film. It’s also part of what distinguishes the Mission: Impossibles, and Cruise himself, from the rest of the genre pack. Using every high-tech trick in the book to realize its remarkable spectacles, and yet also recognizing that nothing feels more real than something that’s really done by real humans, McQuarrie and Cruise’s third collaboration (they also did 2012’s Jack Reacher) is a superior marriage of the old and new school. As for its globe-trotting plot, Fallout begins with Hunt trying to obtain a trio of plutonium cores that are also sought by The Apostles, an offshoot of The Syndicate, the terrorist outfit run by Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) that Hunt felled in Rogue Nation. When a maiden attempt to procure those assets fails, Hunt is forced by CIA bigwig Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) to partner with August Walker (Henry Cavill), a government assassin who’s supposed to kill Hunt should he step out of line. That premise is the jumping-off point for a thoroughly tangled espionage tale involving familiar players—Simon Pegg’s Benji, Ving Rhames’ Luther, Alec Baldwin’s IMF chief Alan Hunley—as well as both a friendly and nefarious face from the past. True to form, each of these characters is given ample time to shine by McQuarrie, who makes sure to develop (or at least reinforce) their personalities and relationships through sharp comedic asides—the funniest of which involves a silent back-and-forth about body types between Rhames and Pegg, who at this point share such fantastic chemistry, they just about deserve their own spin-off. Clocking in at a hefty 147 minutes, Fallout is a breakneck blast, never letting up as it barrels, plummets and crashes its way from one jaw-dropper to the next. Through it all, the massive Cavill is an excellent battering-ram foil for both the stout-and-resilient Cruise and the lithe-and-precise Ferguson. And Hunt, an individual who values innocent human life (be it one or millions) above all else, remains a captivating moral compass for McQuarrie’s apocalyptic adventures. Though the headliner does a lot of what we’ve seen him do before—free-climb vertical mountain faces; race motorcycles; run and run and run some more—he does it with a magnetism that, three-plus decades into his superstar career, has few equals. Like his incomparable franchise—continuing to hit impossible peak after impossible peak—he’s as dynamic as he is durable.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," ""Mission: Impossible - Fallout"" marks the sixth time Tom Cruise has played the IMF agent Ethan Hunt, and I know it's hard to believe, but this may be his most action-packed adventure yet. It almost boggles the mind that Cruise, at 55 (when he shot the movie), is doing things in ""Fallout"" that actors in their 20s wouldn't dream of. But one of the main draws to the franchise now is seeing which death-defying stunt Cruise can pull off, as he is determined not to disappoint. And in ""Fallout"" there are as many as five that will leave you in disbelief. In the movie, Hunt and his team — played by Ving Rhames, who has been in all the movies in the franchise alongside Cruise, and Simon Pegg, who has been on since ""M:I III"" — are once again up against insurmountable odds. I mean, should I even go on? Do you even remember the plot of the most recent movie? I don't. OK, let's get to the good stuff. The action director Christopher McQuarrie (who also directed 2015's ""Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation"") has masterfully crafted I promise you will not be topped the rest of the year. Hunt does an insane skydive, a blitzing motorcycle ride through Paris (including driving the wrong way on the Arc de Triomphe), and a helicopter chase in Kashmir, and then hangs off a cliff when his helicopter crashes … into another helicopter. And it wouldn't be a Tom Cruise movie if there weren't lots and lots of running. ""Fallout"" really has no connective tissue. As much as McQuarrie tries, when there's a break in the action it's more just to catch your breath than to pay attention to what the characters are doing. We've really veered far away from Brian De Palma's first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie back in 1996 (yes, that’s how long Cruise has been doing these darn movies), when it made a little sense for the story why Hunt would do a crazy stunt. Now the basic reply Hunt gives when he's about to do something insane is simply, ""I'll figure it out."" That is literally said about three times in ""Fallout."" This makes it all the more puzzling why the run time for this movie is 2 1/2 hours. There's not a lot to explore. Still, the lengthy action sequences and buildup are done so well you definitely won't feel as if you got shortchanged. Rebecca Ferguson returns as Ilsa Faust, who was the scene stealer in ""Rogue Nation."" She once again gives a great performance, but the standout this time is a newbie to the franchise, Henry Cavill, as a CIA operative who joins Hunt's team. He's big, tough, and sporting that now-infamous mustache. There are moments between the action in this movie that make you sit back and applaud McQuarrie for doing something a little creative with the story, specifically some flashback scenes and dream sequences (that's right, there are dream sequences in this movie). But who am I kidding — the stunts, man! We see Tom Cruise jump out of a plane, get struck by lightning, save a man in free fall, and do it all in one single shot.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Over the past two decades, the Mission: Impossible film franchise has become the reliable, comforting home that’s always ready to shelter Tom Cruise. No matter what turns his career takes, there’s always Ethan Hunt: the dogged Impossible Missions Force operative who always gives 110 percent, perpetually putting himself at risk to secure other people’s safety. In a different era, Hunt would serve as a sort of Platonic action-hero ideal, and there wouldn’t be any need to dig past the archetype itself. But there’s been an interesting wrinkle in the franchise, starting with Brad Bird’s 2011 take, Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol. Hunt has had to face the notion of consequences — and not just the usual ones, where if he fails, some madman might blow up the world. Now, Hunt is facing personal consequences for his actions, as he has to leave behind his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) because he can’t sustain a relationship while perpetually globetrotting to save the world. Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible - Fallout builds that core idea into an entire film. Or at least it builds that core idea into a frame for jaw-dropping setpieces and brain-numbing plot twists. The result doesn’t just feel like the sixth installment in a long-running series, it feels like an authentic sequel to 2015’s Rogue Nation, bringing back many of the key characters and storylines to explore whether the ideals of a character like Ethan Hunt even make sense in the modern world. And it explores those ideas while telling an audacious, exhilarating story. Fallout begins with a new IMF mission: after Hunt captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) in Rogue Nation, Lane’s criminal cohorts have reorganized under the name The Apostles, and are trying to obtain some missing plutonium. They hope to create order from the chaos of the world by inflicting massive harm through a series of attacks, and forcing countries to work together as the old world order falls. Hunt puts together a mission to buy the plutonium before The Apostles can get their hands on it, enlisting his usual cohorts: Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames, still the master of deadpan reactions) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg). When things go awry, Hunt suddenly faces a choice: save Stickell, or protect the plutonium. The conflict clearly lays out the central conundrum in Hunt’s character, but IMF director Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) spells it out for the audience anyway: Hunt’s inability to prioritize the greater good over a single life may make people see him as a hero, but can also lead to the world becoming much more dangerous. With the CIA no longer confident in Hunt’s abilities, agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) is assigned to team up with Hunt to get the plutonium back. That sounds like a lot of setup, but it isn’t even Fallout’s first act. The movie is packed with plot reversals, and new characters arrive at every turn. The Crown’s Vanessa Kirby shows up as the White Widow, an arms broker who can help Hunt procure the missing plutonium. Angela Bassett plays no-nonsense CIA head Erica Sloan. Harris’ Solomon Lane returns as a key figure, and so does Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), the MI6 agent who infiltrated Lane’s network in Rogue Nation. All of this is a lot for audiences to keep track of, and at a certain point, there are so many plot micro-turns that it becomes easier to stop trying to make sense of it all, and let the story wash by on the way to the next action sequence. That’s where the film really makes a statement, because Mission: Impossible - Fallout merges the franchise’s big-budget spectacle with an utterly ferocious style of action filmmaking that far surpasses what McQuarrie executed in either Rogue Nation or Jack Reacher. It’s filled with gasp-inducing motorcycle chases, kinetic car sequences, and bruising, brutal combat. When called into action, Cavill’s Walker is so savage a fighter that he’s hard to watch at times, whether he’s landing pummeling body blows or bashing his opponents into a bathroom sink. Many of the action beats just feel meaner than the industry standard, whether it’s Hunt taking a bruising tumble across pavement after being thrown from his motorcycle, or the relentless, violent gunplay that peppers so many scenes. It sometimes feels like Fallout is more action reel than movie. The fight sequences are arresting, but they stretch out at such length that they can’t always maintain energy. What makes them constantly watchable, however, is the sheer variety — McQuarrie stages so many different kinds of action sequences in so many different locales that Fallout begins to feel like a James Bond film. The gorgeous IMAX visuals help as well. McQuarrie and cinematographer Rob Hardy pop into the immersive, 1.90:1 IMAX aspect ratio throughout the film, and the footage they capture with the IMAX cameras is stunning, particularly during a climactic helicopter chase above the snowy mountains of Kashmir. Those IMAX cameras are particularly effective in capturing the sheer audacity of Cruise’s stunts. He’s made a personal trademark out of performing his own film stunts as often as possible, especially in the Mission: Impossible series. The actor famously broke his ankle during the filming of Fallout, and yes, the shot where he sustained the injury is in the finished film. (The Graham Norton Show featured a more gruesome breakdown earlier in 2018.) Cruise’s dedication is surprising, but his commitment to the role makes him almost too grounded of a character, which causes a sense of discordance in the later scenes, where the movie pushes into nearly comical levels of spectacle. But no matter how ridiculous the action sequences become, the dedication to that core idea ultimately elevates the film. At one point, Lane warns Hunt that eventually evil will triumph, and the bloodshed that follows will be a result of Hunt’s inability to modulate his worldview — “the fallout of all your good intentions.” Other action films have similarly explored the idea that holding onto an ethos isn’t expedient for a hero — perhaps most notably in Daniel Craig’s take on James Bond. But reframing an American action hero, particularly one played by Cruise, as too heroic to be effective gives the idea a different sense of weight. As a performer, Cruise is known for his steadfast dedication to his work projects. With the more controversial aspects of his public persona, he’s known for his intense devotion to his personal religious beliefs. And as an actor, he’s built a career largely on the idea of being the all-American action star. Fallout channels all of that, using both his performance and everything audiences think they know about Tom Cruise to its benefit. It builds a portrait of a man who’s so resolute in his own beliefs that he pushes people away — even the ones he loves most. But Fallout is still a Tom Cruise movie, so while the movie shockingly follows through with the implications of its main theme, it nevertheless tees up events so that by the end, all feels right with the world. The door is left wide open for another entry in the series, should everyone involved (plus Cruise’s ankle) think they’re up for another go-round. But should this end up as the series’ final entry, it’s hard to imagine a better, more fitting end than Mission: Impossible - Fallout. It’s hilarious and thrilling. It acknowledges that single-minded devotion is what lets characters like Hunt do what they do, while also admitting it would make them incapable of adapting to any kind of normal life. And it’s the ultimate on-screen expression of Cruise’s own personal dedication to stunstmanship at all costs. In many ways, Fallout feels like a movie about Tom Cruise himself, with a clear message to bring across: he’s a complicated celebrity figure, but he’s still a pretty damn good movie star.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," When Tom Cruise jumping out of an airplane, getting hit by lightning, and saving Henry Cavill as they plummet towards Paris is maybe the least exciting thing in your movie, that movie is pretty special. Such is the case with Mission: Impossible - Fallout which is, in a word, incredible. Written and directed by Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects), this sixth entry into the popular Mission: Impossible franchise is a relentless piece of action filmmaking. There’s no bullshit here. Two minutes into the movie, the entire plot is laid out—and then, for the next two and a half hours, that plot unfolds at a breakneck pace. Barely a scene is wasted as things twist and turn with obstacles upon obstacles being furiously placed in front of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) and his IMF crew (once again including Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames). Nothing is ever easy for the characters. Ever. So while this installment is a little lighter on the high tech gadgets most people associate with Mission: Impossible, McQuarrie evolves it by making the missions actually impossible. The story picks up two years after the last film, Rogue Nation, and is more or less a straight continuation. The villain from that movie, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), is back, as is Ilsa Faust, played by Rebecca Ferguson. Ferguson was such a standout in the last movie, it almost feels like McQuarrie developed his layered, intricate script just as an excuse to bring her back. The complex connection she has to Hunt, left over from the last film, elevates the movie as the two constantly tangle throughout. Superman himself, Henry Cavill, is a new addition to the franchise, playing a CIA assassin assigned to keep an eye on the IMF team as they execute their mission. It’s a great character for Cavill, one with very mysterious motives, and his charming yet brutish take is a nice juxtaposition to the more humorous IMF team. Angela Bassett plays his boss, a stern CIA executive, and Vanessa Kirby is a devious, intriguing new character named the White Widow (not, to be confused with this one). Alec Baldwin returns from the last Mission and Michelle Monaghan, who played Cruise’s wife in Mission: Impossible III, is back too. It’s her first starring appearance since that installment, which is just another hint of how deep the rabbit hole goes. With all those characters and all those relationships, it goes without saying that Mission: Impossible - Fallout is very plot heavy. There is no problem filling its admittedly long runtime, thanks to the kinds of double-crosses and major reveals we’ve come to expect from the franchise (and the spy-fi genre as a whole). But seeing as how this is Mission: Impossible, all of that mostly exists to motivate big action pieces which, wow, does Fallout deliver and then some. Things start, as we said, with the incredible jump out of a plane into Paris and move along from there, each scene building on the next. There’s hand-to-hand combat, motorcycle chases, car chases, foot chases, helicopter chases, chases on rooftops, chases on the street, and chases through mountains, just to name a few. And as the action scenes get more impressive, so too do the visuals. There are sequences in Fallout that actually may make you laugh, not because they are funny, but because you cannot believe what you are seeing and laughter is the only human response. Along the way, McQuarrie always makes things difficult for Ethan and his team. Little speed bumps are continually placed in their paths—like a cop being in the wrong place at the right time, or a man going to the wrong sink in the bathroom—each meant to exacerbate what was already going to be a near-impossible situation. Then, as a result, everything has to change and adapt, making each action scene not just intense, but almost a puzzle for the audience and characters to put together. One of the nice things about that approach is McQuarrie doesn’t placate the audience. He’s big on dramatic irony, letting us in on twists early so we can watch the film from a perspective different than the characters. He’s also not afraid to completely pull the rug out from under us to surprise with a big reveal. In fact, the script sometimes feels like the mega-budget version of The Usual Suspects, as Ethan and his team try to figure out who is on their side, who isn’t, and if they can win the day. The difference being, that film featured a lot of people talking, and this one is filled with gorgeous, IMAX-filmed action through Paris, London, and more. Really, if there’s anything bad to say about Mission: Impossible - Fallout it’s that watching it feels like doing 50 miles on a treadmill. You’ll leave the theater delightfully exhausted after spending almost the entire length of the frantically piecing together the plot, feeling your adrenaline pumping during the action scenes, and gripping the seat from constant tension. This is what action movies are all about.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Back in 1996 the ‘60s spy TV show got its big screen treatment with a dark and twist-filled spy thriller from Cruise and director Brian De Palma. Well that’s certainly not the case with this franchise, which in recent years has gone from strength to strength and has now provided the best entry to date in Mission Impossible – Fallout. ""As Ethan Hunt takes it upon himself to fulfill his original briefing, the CIA begins to question his loyalty and his motives. Hunt finds himself in a race against time, hunted by assassins and former allies while trying to prevent a global catastrophe."" Without giving away anything else, the best way of describing Mission Impossible – Fallout is that it beautifully balances the different tones and story-telling techniques from the last five films; learning from past mistakes and bringing together all the great aspects enjoyed by fans over the last two decades. Firstly the action is brutal and gut-punching, the pacing heart-pumping and the stakes so high it's gasp-inducing at times. Meanwhile Cruise gives his all when it comes to those stunts again which we won't spoil, but do watch out for the real one that went wrong, delaying shooting for months. In terms of humour, this is also the funniest film of franchise, even topping the almost cartoony and stupendously fun Ghost Protocol, with most of the laughs provided by series regulars Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames. But all the while the laughs aren't comic relief that overshadows the serious, darker aspects of the plot. And this is also the most personal film for Cruise's Hunt, who is shown at his most vulnerable. From the beginning he's met his match with Cavill's younger, almost more competent agent, all the while wrestling with his past demons which adds a more three-dimensional element to the character in some very emotional tear-jerker scenes. In fact Cruise's dynamic with Cavill is one of the film's highlights, making you think this is The Man From U.N.C.L.E. movie that should have been made. After all Cruise pulled out of playing Napoleon Solo in Guy Richie's adaptation, while Cavill was set to play the Russian spy. But when Cruise pulled out, the Superman star took up his role opposite Armie Hammer instead, producing a pretty average flick; something Fallout is definitely not. But all in all Mission Impossible – Fallout is an improvement on all the previous films' failings, drawing together all the best aspects of them; simultaneously giving off that classic vibe of the original while never being afraid to continually evolve.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," How much spectacle is too much? The question comes to mind often during the 147-minute sixth entry in the Mission: Impossible series, subtitled Fallout and starring, as ever, Xenu’s favorite son, Tom Cruise, as unflappable and mostly unbreakable I.M.F. (Impossible Missions Force) secret agent Ethan Hunt. Behind-the-scenes devotees will know that Cruise fractured his ankle while performing a between-buildings leap during the film’s production. Though it might have made more sense if he tore his Achilles’ tendon, given that writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, overseer of the prior Rogue Nation, begins this arduous blockbuster with the “mission…should you choose to accept it” tape hidden in a copy of Homer’s Odyssey. “No man aforetime was more blessed, nor shall ever be hereafter” is how Odysseus, the wandering protagonist of that ancient Greek epic, describes Achilles, confined to the underworld after his fateful demise by arrow on the Trojan battlefield. Fallout follows through on at least the first part of Odysseus’s sentiment, missing no opportunity to prop up Cruise’s indomitable earthly ego while his character runs, jumps, falls, fist-fights, sky-dives, and clambers up rope and cliff in service of…what exactly? McQuarrie’s screenplay posits Hunt as a selfless warrior who believes one innocent person killed is too many. It’s this staunch dogma that leads the secret agent, in Fallout’s pre-credits action sequence, to choose the life of loyal partner Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) over the suitcase of plutonium that a shadowy cabal of terrorists and their shadowier, Dr. Mabuse-like leader require for a nuclear attack on the holy cities of Rome, Jerusalem, and Mecca. At least, that’s the initial objective. The particulars of the big, bad master plan begin to shift after a certain cable news anchor makes a clever cameo and a false report. The outcome of this ruse sends the I.M.F. team, which also includes tech nerd Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and gruff, ostensibly by-the-book C.I.A. operative August Walker (Henry Cavill), on a nations-traversing expedition to keep the threatened mushroom clouds at bay. Much of the film’s action, though, is confined to France and England, all the better to allow Cruise to drive the wrong way through traffic around the Arc de Triomphe or to ascend, monkey-like, the tower of the Tate Modern so he can strike a power pose against the London skyline. “I’ll figure it out” is Hunt’s oft-repeated mantra in the face of all the purportedly impossible odds. To which the members of his I.M.F. team can only throw up their arms and heave weary sighs as if submissively muttering under their collective breaths, “That’s our Ethan!” A little of this reverent compliance goes a very long way in Fallout, but it gets especially irritating in a late scene in which Stickell delivers a fawning monologue about how unimpeachably wonderful his partner is, as if any doubts to the contrary were equivalent to blasphemy. Stickell is speaking, at that particular moment, to MI6 operative Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who has her own parallel mission to I.M.F. involving the previous film’s villain, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Faust was an indelible foil for Hunt in Rogue Nation, with her sensuously steely demeanor and gravity-flouting legs of doom. Yet here she’s demoted to a neutered cheerleader for his—and, by extension, Cruise’s—reckless abandon. Yet unlike do-their-own-stunt exemplars such as Buster Keaton and Jackie Chan, there’s nothing generous or uplifting about Cruise’s jaw-dropping exploits. Beneath each potentially bone-crunching feat you sense desperation, a need to prove his physical and mental agility so as to keep doubt, a dimming star, and death at bay. It’s an unseemly display, and it’s why Cruise tends to work best in films like War of the Worlds and Eyes Wide Shut, where his vanity is utilized against him, where he exists primarily to be put through a torturous wringer, where he effectively becomes the unwitting butt of a seemingly infinite cosmic joke. You catch a glimmer of that frailty in a close-quarters, bathroom-set fight scene in which Hunt and Walker face off against a roundhouse-kicking, karate-chopping antagonist (Liang Yang). Every time Cruise gets knocked to the floor or through a white-tiled wall, he stumbles to his feet and shoots a what-the-hell-am-I-doing? glance to the ether—or maybe the stunt coordinator. It’s the only time the actor betrays anything close to human fallibility, perhaps because the poker-faced Cavill, cocking his super-sized biceps like a pair of double-barreled shotguns, is a stilted cyborg by comparison. As in Rogue Nation, Fallout’s action scenes are cleanly composed and easy to follow, and so abundant as to become monotonous. There’s barely a second to breathe in between the HALO jumping, the motorcycle crashing, the helicopter ramming, and, in the tedious countdown-clock climax, the frenetic frame-toggling between widescreen 2.39 and IMAX 1.90 aspect ratios. (What Christopher Nolan hath wrought.) It would help if there was a single character worth caring about, though an unintended effect of reducing everyone on screen to a dewy-eyed Tom Cruise booster is that it no longer leaves poor Michelle Monaghan, returning as the incognito Mrs. Ethan Hunt, in the lone thankless role. The real fallout here is that everyone’s a zero. Keith Uhlich's writing has been published in The Hollywood Reporter, BBC, and Reverse Shot, among other publications.

"Jul 12, 2018"," As in every other “Mission: Impossible” film, “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” features terrific set piece after terrific set piece, surrounded by dialogue, characters and plot that vanish from memory at the speed of Tom Cruise‘s arm-pumping sprints. Individually, they’re the kind of action scenes that any other franchise would be proud to build their entire movie around and call it a day, but they never quite reach the heights of the series best, like “Rogue Nation‘s” plane sequence or the jaw-dropping skyscraper spectacle of “Ghost Protocol.” That is, until its climax. The cinematic equivalent of multiple orgasms, ‘Fallout’s final act features wave after wave of breathless action with callouts to previous films in the franchise and utterly batshit crazy moments, cutting between our heroes in various locations as they try to stop the villains, repeatedly upping the ante and the ridiculousness. But the latest film, a direct sequel to the last one, isn’t all action. ‘Fallout’ bests its predecessors in actually creating a coherent plot, albeit not entirely original (not that that’s what we’re here for). And its McGuffin isn’t even really a McGuffin – it’s plutonium. Anyone who follows the news (and isn’t making it via Twitter rants) immediately understands the real-life dangers inherent in villains having access to nuclear weapons; this isn’t some object whose implications are unclear or is just made up to serve the plot of a spy movie. Ethan Hunt (Cruise) jets across the globe, going from Paris to London and beyond in the attempt to secure the plutonium and keep it out of the hands of a group of terrorists who call themselves The Apostles, disciples of Solomon Lane (Sean Harris playing the antagonist from ‘Rogue Nation‘) and his now-splintered Syndicate. With each film prior to “Fallout,” the “Mission: Impossible” series has offered a new director’s take on Hunt and the IMF, but the sixth outing is the first to repeat both a director – Christopher McQuarrie – and the aforementioned villain. He’s in league with The Apostles, and it’ll require all of Hunt’s talents to save the world from destruction, along with help from forced-upon-him CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg). Elsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and Hunley (Alec Baldwin) return, though it’s initially unclear what their part will be in Hunt’s mission. Cruise’s Hunt has at once never been more human and more superhuman. ‘Fallout’ revolves around his fallibility, with a choice he makes early on that puts the entire world on the line and smaller moments where he’s getting beaten up, falling or simply failing. There’s also even more of an emphasis by McQuarrie’s script on Hunt’s personal and professional relationships and how they affect what he does for a living, but it’s admittedly relative texture. But Hunt (and Cruise) still has seemingly unending stamina, performing feats of strength and speed that are just silly. Even though we can’t possibly believe what he’s doing, whether it’s free climbing a rock face (again) or speeding past landmarks on a motorcycle (again), it’s all a blast for the audience. There’s a delirious joy in watching this much action, this well executed at every level, from Cruise and the cast (and their stunt doubles) to McQuarrie. To mix things up visually from ‘Rogue Nation,’ the director switches his director of photography from Robert Elswit to Rob Hardy for this go-round. Hardy has previously worked with Alex Garland on “Annihilation” and “Ex Machina,” and while ‘Fallout’ isn’t as gorgeous as those films, he ably captures the scope and scale, whether he’s careening through Parisian alleys or tumbling over remote mountains. Though McQuarrie initially gained fame as the Oscar-winning screenwriter of “The Usual Suspects,” the dialogue is the weak point of the film. It’s easy to overlook, sandwiched between car chases and said by talented actors (particularly Cavill, his mustache and the underused Angela Bassett), but it thuds on screen with far less grace than the athletic stars who are saddled with it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Why does the handsome man with the twinkle in his eye run so hard? (Was that all of London’s rooftops?) Is he chasing, or being chased? In Tom Cruise’s case, it’s both, as this evergreen movie star with the daredevil heart of a stuntman puts every ounce of effort he can into the long, hard work of maintaining a blockbuster franchise. For the creative minds behind these endeavors, it’s forever a case of keeping ahead of audience expectations, but also running down fans quick to throw their love behind the ever-increasing army of the masked and super-powered. In the shootout phase of international action franchise competition, then, “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” has decidedly zinged one past all caped defenders with a rousing, silly-serious, old-fashioned humdinger that could make a whole audience of veteran action stars nod slowly, wide-eyed, and say, “I remember those days, but I never worked that hard.” At nearly two and a half hours, it’s designed to test your patience for the things that matter in these movies — violent confrontation, deception, jokey camaraderie, and over-the-top action — but it does so with a remarkably re-engaged fluidity of purpose. The only filmmaker to return to the franchise for a second go-round, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie (“M:I — Rogue Nation”) may not have the cloak-and-dagger artfulness of Brian DePalma (“Mission: Impossible”) or the giggle-while-you-gasp rollercoaster sensibility of Brad Bird (the series-reviving “Ghost Protocol” entry). But he’s proven to be a sharp and dedicated keeper of the flame, from first drawn gun to last cliffside stunt. Case in point: even the climactic rehash-the-plot/re-examine-the-loyalties dialogue confrontation between the good guys and bad guys has that pinging sense of stakes-raising excitement. Then again, those crazy pull-off disguise masks are involved, and after six movies, the fact that this latex flavoring can still be surprising, funny, and well-timed for plot-shifting effect is all the proof one needs that this may be the sturdiest, most enjoyable popcorn franchise out there. McQuarrie and gang must have high-fived themselves over that “Fallout” title, with its tripled resonance to the story. It starts with a flubbed mission for Ethan Hunt (Cruise), in which his loyalty to his team — returning players Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames, always welcome — is tested in an undercover deal gone sour. The fallout for the IMF gang’s mistake is, well, fallout, since a mysterious anarchist in cahoots with a terrorist sect known as The Apostles plans to detonate nuclear bombs around the world. Thirdly, though, there’s the definition of the title that action fans care most about: literally tumbling out of a plane at 25,000 feet (which Cruise does for a mission with new franchise member Henry Cavill as a churlish CIA agent) and later from a helicopter in a gonzo climactic setpiece against the Kashmir mountains. Much of the movie, which sees Hunt re-engaging with Rebecca Ferguson’s principled assassin Ilsa and Sean Harris’ bearded psycho Solomon from the last film, takes place in those espionage stalwarts Paris and London. The former offers its narrow streets, roundabouts, and colonnades for thrillingly conceived high-speed vehicle pursuits, and the latter its rooftops for the on-foot kind. These sequences – thrillingly conceived and only mildly digital in execution — give this particular installment the semi-nostalgic feel of a Frankenheimer-esque, Friedkin-tinged European spy thriller from the genre’s heyday. There’s also an effort to enrich the personal story of Ethan Hunt, most notably in the return of Michelle Monaghan as the love that got away, and whose appearance adds the right amount of extra concern – and not in some outmoded damsel way — to the conclusion’s escalating peril. A suitably officious Alec Baldwin is also back as newly committed IMF head Hunley, but the addition of Angela Bassett as a scheming CIA head isn’t as fizzily fun as it should be. Cavill, meanwhile, as Bassett’s charge, does his best to make his performance distract from his physical stature and mustache, but that isn’t always possible. As for the absence of Jeremy Renner, there’s simply too much going on to notice, which is another indication of the series’ durability. And Cruise? Whose faith in extending “M:I” beyond its laughable second and ho-hum third entries has paid massive dividends? As one of the world’s last remaining old-school action stars, he’s obviously loath to show his middle-agedness, as the sheer amount of derring-do suggests. (The building-hopping stunt in which Cruise broke his ankle is there in all its ouch-y glory, which would be when the ghost of Burt Lancaster winks in appreciation.) And yet, as a solidly dependable actor, he also knows the comic value of an exasperated reaction in a fantastically bruising bathroom brawl, and the importance of grounding a globetrotting adventure brand in the occasional nod to heroic integrity. When Hunt stops to apologize to a bystander caught in crossfire, it’s both ludicrous and appealing, the right touch of humanity in the middle of the chaos we love.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an anomaly.  It’s the sixth installment of a decades-old franchise that has hit full steam. This is stranger still when considering its origins during the ‘60s-TV-adaptation boom of the late ‘90s and early aughts. What should have been a passing trend burgeoned into an auteur’s playground of action and intrigue, a feat that becomes doubly impressive when viewed alongside the plasticity of contemporary summer fare. Now add to all that an aging star (Tom Cruise) and his safe choice for director (Christopher McQuarrie)–the only one to return to the fold–rather than a fresh recruit. In theory, this film is out of its depth, doomed to be put out to pasture by something younger and sleeker, making it that much more exhilarating to see Fallout pummel its way into being one of the decade’s best action films. McQuarrie performs a fascinating bit of tonal gymnastics in his reprise as writer-director. Reteaming with Cruise came with the caveat that he be allowed to direct the film differently — a condition that not only reveres the series’ open arms toward visionary filmmaking, but allows him to come into his own as a maestro of tensely wrought setpieces. If Rogue Nation was a formalist entry in the spirit of a gilded, breezy Hollywood caper, then Fallout is a heavy, ice-cold rebuke. It less akin to Hitchcock and instead taps into a combination of John Frankenheimer, Michael Mann, and Christopher Nolan. That hard edge more befits what some would have expected the director behind The Way of the Gun and Jack Reacher to make the first time around. Thankfully, however, McQuarrie’s been afforded the rare chance to mature into a mega-budget craftsman across this ostensible two-parter. His second spin with the IMF yields some emotional and cerebral (for this franchise, anyway) flourish, now that he’s in full command of the explosive faculties that give these movies their mileage. What’s more, he miraculously finds a way to churn out the same basic franchise plot points (weapons of mass destruction, disavowal and double crosses) with enough raw nerve to make it stand out. Although his script spends so much time excelling at the stone-cold that it occasionally forgets to be warm, the pace it manages to deliver both across its runtime. Corralling some of the best shot, edited, and scored sequences in recent summer action fare, while navigating a script that conjures giggles and gasps within seconds of each other, is a tightwire act few can pull off as effortlessly as McQuarrie does in Fallout’s peak moments. As is the case with each Mission, the center of gravity on that tightwire is Cruise, but one wonders for how much longer. Fallout brings he and Ethan alike to the seeming culmination of all past endeavors, and, at 56, he is aged and exhausted. Wear and tear is on display with every sprint, tumble, and daredevil leap. While the actor may not intend this, the film certainly does. We’re given a deep dive into Hunt’s inner clockwork to find a man who’s potentially lost a step whether he’d like to admit it or not. In that respect, Cruise’s weathering rings true in what’s arguably his best dramatic turn as the character. For a series that bounced back from a PR kerfuffle by turning its lead into a pliable action figure, leaning head on into a character study is a bold risk. It pays off. This Buster Keaton physicality is punching up against the public perception of him–sending him out of planes, off motorcycles, and over cliff faces–and dammit if it isn’t viscerally engaging every time. Hunt’s odyssey is bolstered in no small part by the film’s ensemble, old and new. Henry Cavill gamely follows in lock step with Cruise as CIA operative August Walker, in what amounts to a career-best performance. Brimming at the mustache with snide charm and brutality, he’s the perfect physically imposing foil these films too often lack. He’s dog-leashed by a wonderfully steely Angela Bassett, whose appearances are unfortunately few and far between. Her absence, coupled with the notably short scenes for Vanessa Kirby’s wily black-market broker, reveal the unfortunate lack of prominent roles for women across this franchise, despite best efforts. This is offset, at least, by the welcome return of Rebecca Ferguson. She’s electric when she gets her due, which is relatively often, as McQuarrie tries to work in a little something for everyone here. There’s even time for a teary Ving Rhames (with the most screen presence he’s had in 3 movies) and Simon Pegg mugging in multiple masks. Against all odds, Fallout continues Mission: Impossible’s ongoing streak of extremely rewarding returns. Though it’s anybody’s guess where a seventh installment would skyrocket Ethan Hunt et al, the series could just as easily call it here and remain equally satisfying. McQuarrie has proven himself such a keen purveyor of large-scale cinema that not only solidifies Fallout as a benchmark for the franchise, but a bona fide manifesto for breathtaking, high-stakes action–a mission that the genre as a whole would do well to accept.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Mission: Impossible Fallout opens July 27, and the hope is that it’ll end Paramount/Viacom Inc.’s summer on a high note. After a near-total drought since late 2015 to late 2017 (essentially from Daddy’s Home to Daddy’s Home 2), the beleaguered studio has mounted something of a minor comeback. A Quiet Place is the year’s biggest wholly original Hollywood release, earning more money in North America ($187 million) than any original live-action flick since Chris Nolan’s Interstellar ($189m) in late 2014. Book Club has earned $67m domestic from a $13.6m debut on a $10m acquisition fee, and apparently the Transformers prequel Bumblebee is testing well. There is a brutal irony in Tom Cruise, 12 years after not having his production deal renewed by Summer Redstone after Cruise earned too much of Mission: Impossible 3’s too little profits, becoming something of a savior for the studio. Between Mission: Impossible 6 and next summer’s Top Gun 2, Cruise is anchoring two of Paramount’s most surefire offerings over the next two years. And if M:I 6 makes anywhere near the last two films’ over/under $200 million domestic and under-$700m worldwide totals, Paramount has a shot of having a true-blue winning year. Fallout is the first movie in the franchise with a returning writer and director, with Rogue Nation’s Christopher McQuarrie giving it a second go-around. The hope is that this buzzy and (review spoiler) dynamite action sequel will capitalize both on its own quality and the long-running popularity of the franchise, to say nothing of how much folks liked the last two movies. Whether or not this plays like (relatively speaking) the Skyfall of the M:I franchise (part three following a soft, continuity-centric reboot) and sails over prior franchise milestones (it’ll be the first one in 3D), I’d be shocked if this one didn’t end up being the summer’s last mega-hit. Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible Fallout is as relentless and intense an action movie as you’ve seen since Mad Max: Fury Road. The action sequences, character confrontations and plot turns pile on-top of each other from beginning to end, with barely moment to breathe in between. The set pieces are as gloriously gonzo (and refreshingly believable) as you’d hope, with Tom Cruise again indulging his inner Jackie Chan for our amusement. But the pacing, which occasionally puts this spy adventure on par with The Dark Knight, comes at a cost. The drama is slight compared to Rogue Nation or even the melodramatic Mission: Impossible 2, and the non-stop action only offers so much time for contemplation, subtext or story. While this is not a direct quality comparison, McQuarrie’s last two Mission: Impossible movies almost feel like a Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace-type two-part play. If the last film was (comparatively) more small-scale, introspective and character-driven, then this second act is pure action and big-scale organized chaos. And yes, there is a small attempt to tie in the last four installments together, although it’s not nearly as obnoxious or self-defeating as what we saw in Spectre. The connective tissue all-but-retcons poor, under-loved Mission: Impossible 2 out of existence (#Justice4Doves). Moreover, this larger-than-life blow-out does occasionally resemble a conventional “more, bigger, faster” than the smaller-scale previous three films. The movie starts with Ethan and his team (Simon Pegg and Ving Rhames) botching an arms exchange, putting the world in nuclear peril. Attempts to retrieve illicit plutonium puts Ethan in the crosshairs of the CIA (embodied by Angela Bassett and Henry Cavill), into the potential clutches of a broker known as the White Widow (a glorious Vanessa Kirby) and into the crosshairs of good-old Isla Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). What they all want with each other and what it has to do with the previously captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) I will leave for you to discover, but the story is relatively streamlined. The thin narrative is merely a clothesline for a near-non-stop barrage of fights, chases and showdowns of the hard PG-13 variety. This installment feels less autobiographical than the last few. At least some of the “Nobody believes Ethan!” schtick feels like a repeat of Rogue Nation’s thematics. Fallout emphasizes what has long been a defining characteristic for this American superspy. Yes, Hunt remains a kamikaze daredevil in pursuit of saving the day, but he also does his best to fight the bad guys without becoming a bad guy. His unwillingness to “trade lives” or sacrifice bystanders for the greater good adds tension and suspense to the proceedings while suggesting that he and Steve Rogers would get along. The bad guys’ whole “always trying to save the world, but never trying to change it” motif sounds a lot like Ultron. The Apostles, offshoots of Lane’s Syndicate, are essentially trying to pull a Watchmen, with a catastrophic attack that will unite the world in a kind of panicked peace. With the world being what it is right now, the baddies don’t sound crazy when they discuss whether Ethan ever thought about not accepting a mission that would merely reassert the status quo. The whole “What were we spying for?” thing has been a running theme since Jim Phelps sold out his team for retirement money. That Tom Cruise is nearly the same age that Jon Voight was in the first Mission: Impossible adds a potency to the proceedings, even if Hunt still acts like a 35-year old. For those who just came for the fireworks, you’re in for a hell of a ride. Christopher McQuarrie directs the hell out of this one, offering sleek, polished, huge-scale (and always comprehensible) action sequences that quicken the pulse and occasionally tickle the funny bone. It’s a more straightforward actioner than Brad Bird’s near-farcical Ghost Protocol, and the stakes eventually become so high that we lose a little bit of the “Will Ethan win?” tension. Considering the running gag of these superspies essentially knowing every possible skill, it’s a kick to see Ethan trying to fly a helicopter for the first time. At least he doesn’t accidentally fly it into a tunnel toward an oncoming train. Ferguson is (again) great fun, as the movie gives Ilsa her own agenda that prevents her from turning into a tag-along girl. She and Hunt are clearly into each other, but the movie keeps it platonic even as you realize that she and Benji would make a cute couple. Henry Cavill’s mustache nearly steals the show as a blunt-instrument CIA agent. Man from U.N.C.L.E. was Cavill playing a Roger Moore-type 007, but Fallout lets him play in the Daniel Craig sandbox. He's the sort of tall, built-like-a-brick secret agent who would rather kill their way to victory versus dropping from the ceiling by a yo-yo. Pegg and Rhames are there for the ride, but they remain (or have become) every bit as essential to the franchise as Tom Cruise. They have come to represent his conscious and a representation of why he fights, as well as existing as potential casualties that are comparatively more expendable than Hunt or even Ilsa at this point. Even Alec Baldwin gets some find father-figure moments when it counts. There is a lot of character shorthand, which A) is okay since this is a sequel and B) is important considering that the movie barely stops moving for 147-minutes. Fair or not, the plot and character work nearly stop after the second act, with the set-up and execution of the big action finale (comparatively bigger than any M:I climax since Cruise and Scott jousted on motorcycles) taking up the majority of the third act. Only an “unexpected” reunion (not a spoiler since it’s foreshadowed in the opening scene) offers a diversion from the visceral action thrills.  No spoilers, but it works as intended and ends on a surprisingly moving note. More so than even Rogue Nation, Fallout feels like a true-blue sequel and ends on what amounts to a finale to the franchise’s second act. I missed the character work from the last two movies, but this is a solid, solid action movie. Mission: Impossible Fallout has the relentless pacing of Mad Max: Fury Road, an occasional hair-trigger intensity (and IMAX-enhanced scale) that will remind you of The Dark Knight and plenty of the unique flavoring that has turned this franchise from “Tom Cruise: Generic Action Man” into the most exciting, inventive and just-plain best action franchise around. It stands alongside Skyfall as a fine pay-off chapter to a soft reboot of a long-running spy franchise. It suffers only in comparison to itself. McQuarrie already made the best movie in the mostly great franchise last time out. He may not top himself this time, but it’s a hell of a thing watching him try.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Tom Cruise will never play James Bond, but there’s a parallel universe in which he’s basically Felix Leiter, 007’s CIA buddy, and now six films deep into his own increasingly Bond-like franchise. Never yet known to decline one of his optional missions — a script gag there for the taking, though a possibly less thrilling night out — IMF agent Ethan Hunt is constitutionally unable to meet a tall vertical structure without flapping from it by his fingernails a reel or two later. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the first of these films to re-use a director, reneging on the initial plan of their producer and star to get a fresh auteur behind the camera each time. If we had to pick one name to return, it’s not likely anyone’s top choice would have been Christopher McQuarrie, whose fifth instalment, Rogue Nation, was the wooliest and least memorable to date — blurring, in my own head at least, with the dingy-basement intrigue and hoarse machismo of the Jack Reacher films. What a turnout for the books, then, that McQuarrie has got it so right on his second try. Fallout doesn’t stint on the state-of-the-art set pieces that have long been a series staple, ever since Cruise dangled above that motion-sensitive vault floor with Brian De Palma holding the strings. Beyond these highlights, which get more and more spectacular as the film goes on, it has tricks in its story you don’t see coming, and even the several scenes in, yep, dingy basements — McQuarrie is the most subterranean schemer in the business — pay off with nifty reversals that justify every beat of their seemingly drab exposition. Take the killer opening, which feels awfully sombre and fun-free — nuclear attacks in holy cities?? — until you figure out the game Cruise and McQuarrie are playing. It’s not the last rug-pull tucked away in a pleasingly sinuous plot, about smallpox outbreaks, extremist splinter cells and bartered plutonium, which snakes its way from Belfast, via lengthy stops in Paris and London, to culminate with helicopter chases that dance with serene majesty above Kashmir’s Himalayas. This finale has got to rank among the most eye-poppingly gorgeous action sequences ever shot: huge hat-tip to the generally amazing British cinematographer Rob Hardy (Annihilation) for saving such lavish visual treats for dessert. Rogue Nation, perhaps, could be looked upon as just a dry run, a mere drawing board for all the feints and ruses developed this time, snagging Hunt and his dependable mainstays Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) in a spider-web of shifting affiliations. Not one of the agents played by Angela Bassett, Alec Baldwin or Rebecca Ferguson is consistently on their side. A surviving villain, Sean Harris’s wild-eyed doomsayer Solomon Lane, becomes a negotiating tool whom the IMF brigade are forced into the ironic position of rescuing, during a sterling vehicular heist sequence along Paris’s riverbanks. This bit does everything in, to and around the Seine you can realistically imagine, short of drinking it dry or teleporting it to Pluto. The score, by Lorne Balfe, is another asset, taking the famous three-note motif from that theme tune and stretching it out with plenty of muscular variation. Speaking of muscles, there’s Henry Cavill, too, who gets a kind of extended guest spot as a surly CIA assassin called Walker, looking so much like a Tom of Finland sketch, complete with porny moustache, that they can only be styling him that way on purpose. Perhaps his role might have been better written — he does a lot of standing around looking shifty, as if waiting for a fluffer to show up — but the instant animus between him and Cruise tenses things up quite handily. On the scrawnier end of the cast list, you get Pegg and Harris not only swapping faces — great workouts for that wonderfully naff gimmick this time — but also punching the living daylights out of each other. Finding space for lively nuggets of McQuarrie dialogue (“we’ll burn that bridge when we come to it”), and even a sonic quotation from The Godfather, the stonking sound mix makes this almost as much fun to listen to as it is to watch. And while not everything works out perfectly — through no fault of her own, Vanessa Kirby’s part as a glamorous underworld broker feels like a Bond-girl role too far, and Wes Bentley has a weirdly pointless walk-on as Michelle Monaghan’s new husband — it’s hard not to surrender to the sheer practical chutzpah of McQuarrie’s aims this time. When Cruise is clambering around St Paul’s, over the top of Blackfriars Bridge and right the way to the summit of the Tate Modern, it’s oddly beautiful to watch London geography being so crisply respected, even while it’s being used as a giant and ludicrous plaything. OK, McQuarrie may not have De Palma’s sweat-drop precision, John Woo’s craziness or the impish wit of Brad Bird, but his mastery of logistics here is easily sufficient to make it the blockbuster of the summer.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Man oh man, what a ride. If there’s a way to have more pure, exhilarating fun in a movie theater, I am not aware of it. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the type of movie where you leave the theater with so much adrenaline pumping through your veins that you just don’t know what to do with yourself after. Who is Ethan Hunt anyway? As we head into this sixth chapter of the Mission: Impossible franchise (it’s so weird to think the first film came out 22 years ago and was directed by Brian De Palma), we still know so little about Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. In the third film, Ethan is all of a sudden engaged to Michelle Monaghan’s Julia and telling party stories about how traffic works. I suppose this was a way to give Ethan a personal story, but it still came off as a bit phony. Like it was just another one of Ethan’s schemes because that guy is always up to something! But, in the end, we still didn’t learn much about Ethan himself. Before watching Fallout, I rewatched the first Mission: Impossible, which I still love for being unapologetically confusing. It doesn’t have the Big Tom Cruise Stunt like these later movies have, but the scene of Cruise hanging inches above the floor at CIA headquarters still tops all that would come later on the “iconic” scale. But it’s funny, now, how synonymous Cruise is with Mission: Impossible and to remember, then, that this first movie was controversial because of the way it treated Jim Phelps (played by Jon Voight in the film, Peter Graves played him in the television series) – anyway, no one talks about Jim Phelps anymore. Over the course of the first five movies, one installment had little to do with the next one, to the point that when something is referenced from a prior movie it was almost shocking. The only constant over these films has been Cruise and, to varying degrees, Ving Rhames (thankfully the most recent installments use Rhames quite a bit). And up until now each installment had a different director, which ends with Fallout as Rogue Nation director Christopher McQuarrie returns, making Fallout the first true direct sequel in this series so far. Fallout is the only installment where you do kind of have to watch the previous film to know what’s going on here. Sean Harris even returns as the villain, Solomon Lane. It’s kind of a (welcome) shock to the system how much this ties in with Rogue Nation. And we finally learn a lot more about Ethan Hunt and what his relationships are with both Julia and Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust. We learn more about Ethan in this movie than we did the previous five movies combined. This is the Skyfall of Mission: Impossible movies. Ethan Hunt is having nightmares about his ex-wife, Julia, because she is now living in hiding because of her prior relationship with Ethan. He’s also having nightmares about Solomon Lane blowing up the world. As Fallout opens, Ethan Hunt and his team botch a purchase of rogue plutonium, meaning it’s now out there on the open market. After this failure, a bigwig at the CIA, Erica Stone (Angela Bassett), forces one of her agents onto the IMF team, Henry Cavill’s infamously mustachioed August Walker. With Walker at his side for every move, Ethan now has to pose as an international terrorist in an effort to try to buy the plutonium back before the worst happens. The people who have the plutonium don’t want money, they want the return of Solomon Lane. So now Ethan’s job is to bust Solomon Lane out of prison. And there’s another catch — Ilsa Faust is also after Solomon Lane, but she wants to kill him, which would really mess up Ethan’s plan to get the plutonium back. But the draw of these latest Mission: Impossible movies are the Tom Cruise stunts. Cruise has become the Evel Knievel of movie actors. Our human brains are a strange thing: they can watch something like Skyscraper and shout, “Fake, fake, fake!” but we try to ignore them because we want to have a good time. Conversely, our brains watch Mission: Impossible – Fallout and they give us a huge adrenaline rush because they know what we are watching is real. It looks amazing. Yes, that’s Tom Cruise actually doing a HALO jump! Yes, that’s Tom Cruise actually hanging onto a rope under a helicopter! Yes, that’s actually Tom Cruise flying a helicopter by himself! (Cruise reportedly went on a crash course helicopter flying training program so he could get his license and be the only one in the helicopter.) It’s impossible not to be swept away by how real and intense everything looks and feels. (I should note that the screening I attended was at an IMAX theater and I can’t recommend seeing it that way enough.) There was a time when I thought I wanted Tom Cruise to go back to making dramatic movies and really act. I have changed my mind. I just want Cruise to keep making Mission: Impossible movies. When Cruise is 85, I want the plot to be “to save Earth, Ethan Hunt has to go get Elon Musk’s space car because a remote detonator is inside, and drive it back to Earth,” and then Cruise actually gets in a spaceship and goes and gets it. I’m in! Sign me up for six more of these movies. Simply put, Mission: Impossible – Fallout is the best action movie you will see this year. You’ll probably leave the theater overcome with an urge to go jumping from building to building.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","Fallout is a solid summer blockbuster that delivers on thrills, smiles and exuberant facial hair. Mission accomplished.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," There is nothing quite like the Mission: Impossible franchise in Hollywood. Sure, some series have been around longer, but most have recast and retooled as time has gone by. Mission: Impossible, by contrast, has continually upped its game while keeping Tom Cruise's Ethan Hunt front and center in the story. We're now on installment number six with Mission: Impossible - Fallout, and while conventional wisdom would dictate that a 22-year-old franchise fronted by a 56-year-old action star would have flagged by now, but the new film has shockingly improved upon the series in almost every conceivable way. It's not only one of the best installments in the M:I canon, but one of the best action movies of the century so far. Set two years after the events of Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Fallout catches up with Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his IMF team on the trail of three nuclear weapons. However, when the IMF loses the warheads during a botched operation (due to Ethan making a moral judgement call) the team is forced to ally with CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill) as they go on a journey to track down the elusive John Lark - an anarchist who wants to use the nukes to create a new world order. Along the way, demons from Ethan's past surface as he finds himself face to face with endlessly-enigmatic Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and the maniacal Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Let's get one thing out of the way up front: action franchises shouldn't maintain this level of high quality with this degree of consistency. What Tom Cruise has managed to do with the Mission: Impossible franchise is nothing less than amazing, as Mission: Impossible -Fallout continues the series' impeccable track record of delivering nonstop action defined by the specific artistic fingerprint of the director behind the camera. In this particular go-around, Chris McQuarrie (the first director to double up in the series) has pretty much perfected his craft as a Mission: Impossible director. The fights are brutal, stunts are kinetic, and the chases are as pulse-pounding as they get. McQuarrie has honed a lot of the traits that showed up in films like Jack Reacher and Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation to deliver a movie that, at least from an action perspective, tops anything that you're going to see this summer. Yes, movies like Avengers: Infinity War and Deadpool 2 offered up some delightful set pieces with the help of strong special effects, but Mission: Impossible - Fallout is the type of movie that will endure because of the sheer level of practical authenticity apparent in each shot. Even after the Burj Khalifa sequence from Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol or the airplane stunt from Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, there are moments in Fallout that are unlike anything we have ever seen. Of course, a considerable portion of the credit goes to Tom Cruise, who continues to double down on his status as an action icon. Honestly, after audiences get a chance to see Fallout, it will be hard to argue against the notion that he's the genre's most powerful and enduring figure. Between a single take HALO jump, a white-knuckle motorcycle chase, and a death-defying helicopter dogfight (to name a few set pieces), Fallout stands out as one of the most thoroughly-impressive physical performances that Cruise has ever delivered. Tom Cruise's stunt prowess seems aided by the fact that the seasoned actor arguably delivers his best performance as Ethan Hunt in Mission: Impossible - Fallout. There's a healthy balance of physical and emotional pain lurking behind Ethan in this movie that wasn't apparent in many of the other films, with Cruise effectively conveying the character's perpetual exhaustion through his daring exploits. Move over, James Bond, because Ethan Hunt is the action world's defining spy these days. The rest of Fallout's cast rises to the challenge of matching Cruise's intensity, as well. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg remain reliable as Luther and Benji, Ethan's most trusted confidants, while Rebecca Ferguson's return as Ilsa Faust helps to complicate the story and add more layers of the distrust that were apparent in Rogue Nation. With all of that said, it's Henry Cavill who rises to the top of the supporting cast as CIA agent August Walker. A ""hammer"" to Ethan Hunt's ""scalpel,"" Walker is a brutally-efficient character who gets some jaw-dropping action beats (particularly one fantastic bathroom fight scene) alongside Mr. Hunt. All of this feels bolstered by a strong sense of tone, a beautiful visual style, and a booming score by Lorne Balfe that evolves the legendary Mission: Impossible theme in almost every way. Some audience members might feel somewhat jarred by the aspect ratio changes that occur throughout the movie as some scenes swap back and forth between the IMAX and standard formats, but other than that, Mission: Impossible - Fallout remains one of the most beautiful-looking blockbusters that we have seen so far this year. It should be noted that for everything Mission: Impossible - Fallout does right, it's not a completely airtight story. Fallout is arguably the most continuity-driven entry in the franchise to date, with some deep cut references to other entries in the series (particularly as they relate to Vanessa Kirby's White Widow character) that newcomers might not pick up on at first. It's not enough to break the movie's story by any means, but when compared to the relatively lean storytelling of past films, it can make Fallout feel a bit busy at times. Nevertheless, this is a minor quibble in the grand scheme of things, as Fallout generally feels expertly-executed from start to finish. Mission: Impossible - Fallout is one of the most confident and capable action movies of the century. The franchise only seems to gain momentum with each passing installment, and the sixth entry in the series leaves us hoping that Ethan Hunt and the agents of the IMF will continue to accept these missions for years to come. See this movie as soon as possible, and on the biggest screen possible. Originally from Connecticut, Conner grew up in San Diego and graduated from Chapman University in 2014. He now lives in Los Angeles working in and around the entertainment industry and can mostly be found binging horror movies and chugging coffee.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," REVIEW: After watching Tom Cruise climb the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, it is hard to imagine he could possibly top that incredible stunt. Well, that was way back in 2011 with the exceptional MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL. And now, after taking on the latest in the franchise, you almost have to wonder if there is anything that the man wouldn’t do. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is a massively entertaining new chapter in the series, one that brings Cruise’s Ethan Hunt and his team a new villain with even deadlier intentions. Christopher McQuarrie once again takes on directorial duties and places Mr. Cruise in some of the most jaw-dropping scenarios you’ve witnessed on-screen. In fact, the last hour or so is a relentlessly-paced adventure that will more than satisfy fans of this consistently entertaining franchise. After making a choice to save his team, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) loses a briefcase loaded with plutonium. Thus, Ethan, Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) find themselves working to recover it. However, they are forced to bring along CIA Agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), who instantly clashes with Hunt. The team is led to a mysterious woman known only as the “White Widow” (Vanessa Kirby) who claims she can return the missing items. However, her only price is that they help recover a valuable asset; Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Hunt soon finds that he is not the only one looking for Lane, when Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) returns, seemingly with an entirely different agenda. It all leads to an epic finale that somehow manages to top the previous entires. The MI franchise continues to soar to new heights and I mean that both figuratively and literally. When it comes to action, the level of suspense and thrills here is astounding, as incredible as what has come before, yet on an even grander scale. If you can find even a couple of fantastic action sequences in a feature film, most audiences will be more than satisfied. FALLOUT is loaded with them. This includes a brilliant fist fight that breaks out in a restroom. If memory serves it may be one of the most brutal in the series as well. Watching Cavill and Cruise duke it out with Liang Yang is impressive enough. If you add a little humor, it is easily one of the best in a movie filled with intense action sequences. Another one of the most impressive moments in the film happens after a recovery attempt gone wrong. We’ve certainly seen Tom Cruise on a motorcycle a number of times, but this particular chase scene in Paris is one for the books. While it is certainly risky for the actor to handle his own stunts, he continues to raise the bar. Watching him take on all the stunt work brings real jeopardy to the series. In fact, I’m shocked that he only broke his ankle during filming what was, ironically, one of the more simple stunts in the film. Of course that exact shot is the one the used in the film, and you can certainly see – and perhaps even feel – the moment it breaks. The masterpiece of FALLOUT, of course, is the last hour or so, when all secrets are revealed and the final battle plays out. From an awe-inspiring helicopter chase to scaling a massive cliff, McQuarrie has gone all out with creating what may be the best in the franchise. However, I may have to revisit GHOST PROTOCOL before that is official. Either way, McQuarrie and Cruise appear to have perfected this incredible series. The stunt work is beyond exceptional and it’s always welcome to see Cruise, Rhames and Pegg working together. And then you have Rebecca Ferguson, who once again steals nearly every scene she is in. The chemistry between her and Cruise is simply fantastic. Seeing this is IMAX as I did, you may just have a perfect movie-going experience.Technically speaking, FALLOUT is a visually stunning work thanks to cinematographer Rob Hardy and McQuarrie. Certainly, the action set pieces are some of the best we’ve seen in the franchise, yet even the quieter moments shine. When Hunt realizes that Faust is following him, it is a beautiful sequence that represents some of the best romanticized stalk and follow sequences this side of Hitchcock. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE – FALLOUT is a monumental success in an already impressive franchise. This latest chapter has everything that makes MI work, yet it feels as though they have gone even farther with the wondrous action sequences. Aside from the previously mentioned obvious twist, the screenplay by McQuarrie is top notch as are his directorial duties. Once again, you'll find that this is a terrific cast on a whirlwind adventure, one that rarely lets up. There is much to admire about FALLOUT, but you may be exhausted when the end credits roll. And of course, Tom Cruise once again brings Ethan Hunt to life. This isn’t just a great action flick, it is likely the most thrillingly exciting film of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," The sixth Mission Impossible arrives, and with it the implausibly well-preserved and pneumatic Tom Cruise as IMF special agent Ethan Hunt – still choosing to accept missions, still on frontline duty while other action stars have long since lapsed into older roles or intermittent political careers. The Cruise is back and breaking out his signature moves: he’s doing the stiff-handed run, the face-rippling no-helmet motorbike racing, car chasing, free climbing on very high rocks – and he simply can’t see an aircraft of any sort taking off without wanting to board by swinging on it from a rope. It has to be admitted, this MI – the second from Christopher McQuarrie – is quite as silly and convoluted as any of the others, but the genre thrills are entertaining. There are colossal action scenes in Paris, London and finally a barking mad helicopter chase sequence in Kashmir, topped off with some outrageously vertiginous hanging-by-a-thread scenes which for me pleasingly brought back memories of Roger Moore-era Bond. And of course there is the traditional high-jinks with rubber masks, an essentially comic part of the IMF armoury entrusted to the cheeky Benji, played by Simon Pegg. It is why certain glowering people in the state department have ungraciously called Ethan’s team “a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick-or-treat”. As well as the familiar team – including the stoic Luther (Ving Rhames) – more faces from the past have been brought back. Top security honcho Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) returns to shepherd the crew’s latest adventure and sleek British agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) reappears to exchange glances of muted chemistry with our hero who is in any case uxoriously obsessed with his lost love: Julia (Michelle Monaghan). Now the deal is that a sinister and shadowy figure called John Lark wishes to blow the world to pieces with three globes of nuclear material that he has managed to steal and in this he is in league with a creepy and bearded archcriminal from the previous film: Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), still impassively in Dr Lecter-ish custody. Ethan has to get this nuclear material back, and must work with a mysterious, glamorous criminal “broker” who has the supervillainesque name of White Widow, played by Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret from Netflix’s The Crown). But the authorities, in the form of Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) don’t trust maverick Hunt to do the job his own way so they make him work with big, smug, super-trained tough guy August Walker, in which limited role Henry Cavill is actually rather well cast. August and Ethan endure the reverse of bromance. The approach of McQuarrie – and of course producer-star Cruise – shows how far this franchise has come from the rather cerebral and gadgety world of the 60s TV show and even, to some degree, the first couple of movies, when there was some emphasis on simply outsmarting the bad guys. There are huge amounts of plot entanglements, disentanglements and re-entanglements here, but that is not the point. This is all about action and spectacle and viewed on an IMAX screen these certainly deliver. There is also a terrific bit of close-quarter martial arts in a French men’s room where Cavill, Cruise and Chinese actor Liang Yang beat the living jeepers out of each other while shattering all the vitreous china thereabouts. Over two-and-a-half hours, you get a lot of deafening bangs for your buck, and the tourist location stunts are impressive – but there isn’t as much humour in the dialogue as before. In fact, when Ethan Hunt’s not kicking ass he’s not joking – but rather tearing up, remembering his lost love. And Tom does a couple of very ripe waking-up-from-a-nightmare bits of acting. But crashes and petrolhead spills are what this franchise is reasonably expected to deliver. And this is what it cheerfully does. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 12, 2018","Here is Cruise, 56, performing some of the most impressive feats of derring-do ever captured on screen.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Ageless, riveting and seemingly unstoppable, Tom Cruise remains a force of nature — at least when he’s attached to his equally arresting Mission: Impossible franchise. The sixth film in the series is among the most outstanding, delivering a near-exhausting amount of stupendous action sequences paired with deft character drama and the requisite life-or-death stakes. Fallout is a testament to writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, who gives the proceedings a witty, sophisticated grandeur, and yet the film belongs to Cruise and his seemingly limitless passion for putting himself and his audience through the wringer. Hitting UK theatres July 25 and US screens two days later, this Paramount release looks to top the grosses of 2011’s Ghost Protocol ($695m worldwide) and 2015’s Rogue Nation ($683m), bringing back much of the franchise’s ensemble, notably Rebecca Ferguson and Simon Pegg, while introducing Henry Cavill to the mix. Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, the leader of the Impossible Missions Force (IMF) working alongside his redoubtable cohorts Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames). After an operation to apprehend black-market nuclear weapons backfires, Hunt’s team must go undercover to determine their whereabouts — but they’re assigned a watchdog CIA agent, August Walker (Cavill), to accompany them to ensure they don’t fail again. McQuarrie, who also directed Rogue Nation, fashions Fallout as a continuation of sorts. Hunt remains a divisive figure in the American intelligence community whose loyalty and methods are questioned by superiors, and again his mission puts him in conflict with Ilsa (Ferguson), a beautiful former MI6 agent who can’t reveal why she is shadowing Hunt. Fallout sports a number of clever twists without getting too convoluted, and McQuarrie does fine work juggling a sizable amount of characters, including Alec Baldwin’s IMF liaison Alan and Sean Harris’ icily evil terrorist Solomon Lane, who was Rogue Nation’s chief nemesis and returns to further torment Hunt. But this sequel is more than confident narrative sleight-of-hand. To explain precisely how Fallout explores and enriches character dynamics and emotional themes from earlier instalments would spoil the surprises, but McQuarrie illustrates the sacrifices his main character has made to live the life he’s chosen — and what the toll has been on Hunt and those around him. Not surprisingly, then, a sense of melancholy tempers Fallout’s many thrilling action sequences. In Hunt’s chase scenes, he commandeers motorcycles and helicopters — and because this is a Cruise vehicle, of course the actor engages in a lengthy, electrifying sprint at one point — but McQuarrie’s preference for practical stunts ensures the action has real weight and gravity to it. Like most blockbusters, Fallout puts its protagonist in harrowing sequences that would kill most people several times over, but whether it’s the unrequited feelings between Hunt and Ilsa or the moral choices the character sometimes faces, the filmmaker crafts an urgent, flesh-and-blood realism that underpins all the fantastic escapism. Ferguson isn’t quite as striking as she was in Rogue Nation, but she remains a formidable presence — not to mention bringing out Cruise’s vulnerable side. As an agent critical of Hunt’s techniques, Cavill projects a clean-cut menace that makes it hard to know if his character has ulterior motives for tagging along. And Harris provides Fallout with the same sort of controlled chaos with which he imbued the previous movie. At nearly two-and-a-half hours, Fallout has ambitions as vast as its running time. McQuarrie weaves elements of tragedy and political commentary into the mix, envisioning his story as an epic crime thriller with many players — some of whom will switch allegiances or lose their lives. Additionally, McQuarrie must contend with the logistical framework of franchise maintenance, which requires reintroducing or resolving past plot points in order to extend the series for future editions. That’s its own kind of impossible mission, but like Ethan Hunt, the writer-director displays an impressive resourcefulness, managing to make so many disparate components cohere into an exciting whole. Cruise turned 56 earlier this month, and while he’s had his commercial slipups, such as last year’s The Mummy, the Mission: Impossible movies remain a stirring illustration of what a sterling action star he is. Doing many of his own stunts, he loves to challenge himself physically — and because Fallout is so masterfully constructed, his devotion to putting on a show is entrancing rather than self-aggrandising. Someday, Hunt will have to leave the spycraft to someone younger, but Cruise shows no signs of slowing down. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Jul 12, 2018","Works as the zippiest and most satisfying blockbuster you're certain to see this summer. What it misses in plot, it lands in character and spirit.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","  Much like its ageless star, the Mission: Impossible series shows no signs of running out of either breath or gas (laughing or high-octane) six movies in. As a professional tribe, we critics are supposed to hold our cards close to our vests. But I’d be lying if I didn’t cop to the fact that Fallout was the blockbuster I was most looking forward to this summer. Now, after seeing it, I can say that I’m not even remotely disappointed. It delivers. More than that, it’s proof that this has become the rare franchise that seems to just get better, twistier, and more deliriously fun with each installment.
  By now, we’ve become accustomed to the M:I films’ signature million-dollar money shots — that one hairy, show-stopping sequence in each movie where Tom Cruise risks life and limb for our unquenchable appetite and armchair amusement. 2012’s Ghost Protocol had Cruise’s Ethan Hunt scaling the tallest skyscraper in the world, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, with nothing more than a pair of glitchy adhesive gloves. In 2015, Rogue Nation had the star fearlessly hanging by his fingernails from a Russian cargo plane as it sped down the runway and took flight. Fallout has a half dozen of those scenes. At 56, Cruise won’t be satisfied until the audience cries “Uncle” or he winds up in traction — or worse. He’s still Hollywood’s hungriest movie star.
  Of course, what makes the M:I movies so wildly entertaining is that they offer more than just daredevil, without-a-net thrills. They’re as narratively ambitious and clever as Cruise’s death-defying stunts (his broken ankle might disagree), loaded with a cerebral workout’s worth of double- and triple-crosses. Twenty-two years after he first reinvigorated the hokey TV espionage series, these movies still fit the actor like a glove, defining him in a way that the Jack Reacher ones can’t and the Top Gun ones probably won’t. It’s time to at least start the conversation whether the M:I films have now eclipsed the Bond movies. It’s not as heretical an idea as it may seem.
  Speaking of 007, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie’s Fallout is the closest the series has come to Ethan Hunt’s own Skyfall or On Her Majesty’s Secret Service — the sequel that fills in the IMF agent’s personal backstory and the emotional sacrifices he’s made chasing the lunatic villains of the world. It’s a film with not just action, but stakes. Hunt’s rubber mask drops long enough to give us a glimpse of the humanity underneath. McQuarrie, who also helmed Rogue Nation, has an innate feel for the franchise and the character that matches Cruise’s while also tapping into the sort of Byzantine plot switchbacks he first showed off in his script for The Usual Suspects at the dawn of his career.
  Briskly hopscotching from Belfast to Berlin and Paris to London as well as points East, Fallout pairs an uber-creepy old foe, Rogue Nation’s half-mad anarchist Solomon Lane, with a brand new threat. Played by Sean Harris with a shaggy Unabomber beard, a maniacal sadist twinkle in his eyes, and an insinuatingly weaselly Peter Lorre rasp of a voice, Lane literally haunts Hunt in his dreams. In a torrent of overly thickety exposition provided by Hunt’s boss (Alec Baldwin), we learn that Lane has hooked up with an anonymous terror zealot named John Lark. Lark plans to get his hands on a cache of plutonium and detonate a nuclear attack on the world with the help of a syndicate of doomsday operatives called The Apostles. Why would he do this? Well, why not since he already unleashed a plague of smallpox in Kashmir. Hunt’s mission — should he choose to accept it — is to stop Lark with the help of his trusty sidekicks Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg).
  I realize that this set-up may sound fairly pedestrian. What, another psycho wants to nuke the Earth’s population? Again? But there’s so many terrifically smart gotcha fake-outs along the way and the pacing is so relentless, there’s no time to stop and parse any of it long enough to raise an eyebrow or an objection. Plus, you’re too busy trying to figure out the new characters’ angles and allegiances to care very much. One of them is Henry Cavill’s Walker (replete with non-CG mustache!) — an ice cool brute CIA operative whose been assigned to tag along with the IMF posse. Another is Vanessa Kirby’s White Widow, a shadowy femme fatale who’s as deft with a butterfly knife as she is mysteriously motivated. And then there’s Rebecca Ferguson’s returning Ilsa, who may or may not have switched sides.

"Jul 12, 2018"," Tom Cruise may be the greatest cinematic runner of all time, but the secret of the Mission: Impossible series is that he never really gets anywhere. In 1996’s Mission: Impossible, Cruise’s Ethan Hunt has to combat forces within his own government to uncover the identity of a rogue agent known only by a pseudonym, outwitting the CIA and forging an uneasy alliance with a female black-market dealer as he sacrifices what few personal relationships he has in pursuit of the truth. In 2018’s Mission: Impossible—Fallout, he does … pretty much the same thing, this time chasing down a shadowy anarchist known as John Lark who’s convinced the way to foment world peace is to set off a bunch of nuclear bombs. (The details are a little fuzzy.) Lark is aided by the traitorous former IMF agent Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), despite the fact that Ethan captured him at the end of the previous installment, 2015’s Rogue Nation. Governments come and go, but in the world of stateless actors that Ethan and the IMF inhabit, the players never really change, and all victories are provisional at best. Fortunately, so are the defeats. The key to Cruise’s run, and of the action set pieces for which the M:I movies have become famous, is that he doesn’t make them look too easy. He wants us to see him sweat, to the extent that the first movie’s Langley infiltration—still the series’ highlight, despite some formidable competition—is nearly foiled by an errant drop of perspiration. What distinguishes Ethan, what keeps him alive, isn’t super-spy suaveness or elaborate counter-counterplots (although the series has plenty of both) so much as it is his brute determination to succeed. 2011’s Ghost Protocol, which revitalized the series after two scattered sequels, made a running gag out of Ethan being deserted by the nifty gadgets that had been the franchise’s stock in trade; and in Fallout, his mantra, uttered as he’s rushing into some half-formulated plan, is “I’ll figure it out.” Although it’s the first film in the series to be credited to a single writer-director—Christopher McQuarrie, returning from Rogue Nation—Fallout often feels as if it’s being made up as it goes along. Provocative ideas, like the indication that the film’s villains are “fiercely antireligious” and slobber at the prospect of nukes being simultaneously triggered in the world’s holiest cities, are raised and apparently forgotten about, although a chase across London’s rooftops takes him on a brief detour through St. Paul’s Cathedral, followed by a scramble up the Tate Modern’s tower. The movie sets up in its first scenes a tension between saving individuals and saving the world, a choice Ethan tacitly makes when he lets three spheres full of plutonium slip away rather than sacrifice a teammate’s life. But that action-movie gloss on the trolley problem too slips away, even when Ethan is pitted against a CIA operative, played by Henry Cavill, who’s much more inclined to leave a trail of corpses behind him. McQuarrie leans heavily on the relationships established in previous movies, especially Ethan’s bond with his ex-wife, Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and his smoldering but unresolved sexual tension with Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust, such a badass she very nearly lives up to her name. (Even the best the M:I movies largely function as delivery systems for action sequences, so following the plot is, in Fallout as always, optional, but at least a passing familiarity with Rogue Nation is recommended if you want to keep this one straight.) Perhaps there are people carrying around residual feelings for these characters beyond how fetching they look aiming sniper rifles and dangling over cliffs, and perhaps they’ll derive some pleasure from Fallout’s tangled middle section, a knot of misdirections and double crosses that eventually deposits us exactly where we thought we’d end up. You can’t help but feel for the character who spits, “Why do you have to make this so fucking complicated?” Where it counts, though, Fallout is fiendishly simple. Although the series started out as a haven for visual stylists like Brian De Palma and John Woo, the films have become more solidly satisfying as they’ve passed into the hands of tempered technicians like McQuarrie and Brad Bird. The M:I films share with the Fast and the Furious series a preference for practically based stunts over computer-generated spectacle, and Fallout’s are consistently among the series’ best. There’s nothing here as ingenious as the Langley heist or as visually impressive as Ghost Protocol’s Burj Khalifa climb, and its thrilling three-part climax is tainted slightly when one of its strands ends by photocopying the best part of The Lost World. But for a massive summer tentpole, Fallout’s pleasures are gratifyingly straightforward, direct without being dumbed-down. It’s a meat-and-potatoes banquet, one that doesn’t need to be interesting to be satisfying.",POSITIVE

Some will see the light during the first act HALO jump, when Tom Cruise caps off an exhilarating long-take by leaping out of a C-17 at 25,000 feet, aerial photographer Craig O’Brien capturing the stunt through the IMAX lens strapped to his head (your move, Christopher Nolan). Others might cotton to the film’s brilliance during the bareknuckle fight scene that follows in the bathroom of a Parisian nightclub. Henry Cavill packs so much firepower into each punch that he literally has to reload his arms, and director Christopher McQuarrie — invoking the best of James Bond as he shoots the brawl without any music on the soundtrack — makes sure that we absorb every bodyblow and wince at each piece of busted tile. And if anyone is still on the fence after that, there’s a pretty good chance they’ll be convinced by what comes next: A symphonic, character-driven rescue operation/motorcycle chase/underground getaway sequence that speeds across the City of Lights along a breathless riptide of raw spectacle. Not since “Fury Road” have such viscerally practical effects been put to better use by such deliriously impractical people. And they’re only just getting started. Tom Cruise hasn’t even broken his ankle, yet. But the true genius of the latest (and possibly last) chapter in the long-running “Mission: Impossible” saga isn’t found in one of the film’s death-defying set pieces, or in the elegant way that McQuarrie strings them together like perfect little pearls of violence, or even in the moment when Angela Bassett deadpans some ridiculous line about stolen plutonium with a stoic fury worthy of King Lear. “Fallout” wouldn’t be the near-flawless experience that it is without any one of those things, but they aren’t what makes it great. No, “Fallout” is great because it fulfills a promise that its star made to moviegoers back in the last millennium, and — with only a handful of exceptions — hasn’t reneged on since. It’s a promise that’s made him the last movie star of his kind, a one-man supernova who’s yet to burn out a time when audiences only seem to care about brands. And it’s a promise that Tom Cruise finally voices out loud in the sixth installment of the series that he’s sustained for 22 years, and has sustained him in return for at least the last seven: “I won’t let you down.” Technically, the “Mission: Impossible” movie franchise has been around since 1996, when Tom Cruise partnered with Brian De Palma to reinvent TV super-spy Ethan Hunt. In reality, however, the “Mission: Impossible” movie franchise as we know it today didn’t take shape until J.J. Abrams took the reins a decade later and made Hunt domestic, grounding the secret agent with a wife named Julia (Michelle Monaghan) and a little pocket of suburban paradise. Cruise first inhabited the character as a more intense and team-oriented version of 007, but “Mission: Impossible — III” suddenly inflicted Ethan with something to lose — it made him into a real boy. It softened his heart into an Achilles’ heel. And in the film’s very first scene, when villainous arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) held a gun to Julia’s head and forced Ethan to choose between her and the rest of the human race, he couldn’t do it in time to save them both. Ever since, Ethan Hunt’s empathy has been easy to exploit. And even when Julia was pushed to the periphery of “Ghost Protocol,” or entirely absent from “Rogue Nation,” it was clear that Ethan was more interested in saving the world than stopping the bad guy — it’s always personal for him, but only because of the people he’s trying to protect. A direct sequel in a franchise built from standalone adventures, “Fallout” refocuses on Ethan’s core dilemma with a moral urgency more befitting a prestige drama like “Bridge of Spies” than a late summer blockbuster that opens with a five-minute exposition dump and an extended cameo from Wolf Blitzer (two unexpectedly perfect choices). From the moment it starts, this movie has one question on its mind: Is it possible that Ethan Hunt’s concern for other people isn’t just his greatest weakness, but also his greatest strength? The setup is beautifully succinct, and no, you don’t need to have seen “Rogue Nation” to follow it. A handy little dossier spells everything out before the opening credits: A shady group of anarchists called “The Apostles” have stolen three plutonium orbs that can be weaponized into atom bombs within 72 hours; their intention is to capitalize on the current weakness of the world order (Trump isn’t mentioned by name), razing it to the ground in order to start over from scratch. It’s not a terrible idea, to be perfectly honest, but Ethan takes issue with the means of making it happen. “The greater the pain, the greater the peace” just isn’t a philosophy our boy can get behind. Alas, it’s Ethan who gives the Apostles what they need: When a standoff forces him to choose between nabbing the plutonium, or saving his old pal Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), he inevitably prioritizes one man he knows over millions he doesn’t, and the bad guys run away with the ingredients they need to cook up an international catastrophe.

"Jul 12, 2018"," Right around the time the first trailers for a new Mission: Impossible movie start showing, I always have the same internal conversation. I see Tom Cruise running like Prefontaine through various exotic locations while explosions and things happen around him, and I think “Oh, gosh, do we need another one of these?” Mission: Impossible movies have remained fresh since they began in 1996 by almost fully regenerating based on who’s at the helm. Certain constants remain: Tom Cruise’s stalwart, nigh-pacifistic spy Ethan Hunt; infiltration using high-tech gadgets and perfect impersonation; a team of operatives with special skills needed for said mission; usually some death-defying stunt sequences; twisted plots that are hard to follow some of the time; and so, so, so much running. Within those constraints, the series has varied wildly, and been a direct reflection of the director in look, style, tone, and even execution. This, for some, was reason to fret since the excellent Rogue Nation’s writer-director Christopher McQuarrie was returning for Fallout. I was therefore even more impressed that Fallout feels like it could have been directed by a completely different person. The plot is typical M:I, but it gets way less bogged down in the details, instead offering up a logical progression for Hunt and his IMF crew, again forced to go rogue. Hunt and his usual go-to operatives Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) are on the trail of some stolen plutonium believed to be in the hands of a dangerous the-old-world-must-die cult. Following a botch, the IMF and its new secretary, the laterally moved Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin), are forced to take a CIA blunt instrument named Walker (Henry Cavill) on a mission to correct their mistake. Naturally, nothing goes particularly smoothly and Ethan once again crosses paths with his old enemy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) and his old ally Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) as he traverses the globe and gets in and out of various scrapes. You know, an action movie. There’s a timeless quality to the action in Mission: Impossible – Fallout; you feel every punch of every fist fight and every high speed turn of every chase scene. The impressive and much-touted sky diving sequence is certainly impressive, made to look like a single take, but that’s by no means the height of the movie’s amazing sequences, which include cars and motorcycles through the streets of Paris, a breathless foot chase over rooftops of London, and an astounding helicopter showdown over the Himalayas. Just like the lit fuse that begins the old 1960s TV series, Fallout burns along toward the inevitable explosive climax as the films have always done. However, Fallout also deepens the character relationships built through the other films, which is definitely new for this series. In fact, each of the previous five movies is referenced in some way, some in minor nods, and others in much larger ways. They aren’t so steeped in lore as to make it impossible (pun) to watch the movie if you haven’t seen the previous entries, but it makes for fun Easter eggs to people who’ve stuck with the franchise for 22 years. And what’s more, these references are a reminder that the Mission: Impossible movies have always been incredibly solid, but, to my earlier point, seem to get forgotten in between outings. Only John Woo’s Mission: Impossible II would I consider a true misstep, but even that one has entertaining bits. It shows the malleability of Cruise as an action star, that Ethan Hunt can be so consistent and yet still age with the actor, from a brash and harried young agent in Brian De Palma’s original, to cool guy in Woo’s, to would-be family man in J.J. Abrams’ III, to mission-accomplishing machine in Brad Bird’s Ghost Protocol, and finally to slightly outmoded but effective do-gooder in the two McQuarrie films. The character grows, and the action has grown with him, but nothing has been outgrown and the movies are still freaking fantastic. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is an absolute blast and easily my favorite movie of the summer. It’s a reminder that stunt work and characters still hold more weight than CGI and quips. The plot is slightly more predictable than I’d have liked, but the execution and the fantastic performances of all the actors are still amazingly fun to watch. I can’t wait for the next one!",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," 
	Six movies in, Tom Cruise's category-best action franchise shrewdly pays off elements established over the previous films to deliver the series' most exciting installment yet. For a moment there, the “Mission: Impossible” franchise appeared to be getting a little long in the tooth. This was perhaps a decade ago, between the third and fourth films, when audiences weren’t sure whether they were dealing with a trilogy or an open-ended series. Its star, Tom Cruise, was being a little too emphatic about his Scientology convictions in public. He had made a brilliant, self-effacing cameo in “Tropic Thunder,” showing up in a fat suit and a bald cap, then retreated in the other direction in real life via a series of unconvincing age-defying procedures, as if refusing to let go of his image as an eternal twentysomething. All signs pointed to it being time for Impossible Mission Force operative Ethan Hunt to gracefully retire. How lucky for us that he didn’t. Not only have the films gotten better since, with each one surpassing the last as the most exciting and ambitious of the lot, but Hunt himself has acquired a gravitas along the way that distinguishes the series from its most obvious inspiration, the James Bond movies of the 1960s, back when Sean Connery was that franchise’s first and only star. Now playing to an audience that’s forgotten (if it ever realized) that these films were inspired by a knockoff TV series from the same era, “Mission: Impossible — Fallout” isn’t just another stunt-driven save-the-world bonanza. Of course, it is that, offering a whirlwind tour of Paris, London, and Kashmir this time around, but writer-director Christopher McQuarrie, on board for more, after making slick work of the previous movie, “Rogue Nation,” smartly ties this sixth installment back into what has come before. This time, it really is personal. Ethan Hunt looks his age, even if that makes him the fittest 55-year-old on Earth, sporting distinguished little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes that subtly underscore he’s no hot-shot rookie, and this isn’t his first rodeo. If anything, that’s what sets “Fallout” apart: It’s aware of Hunt’s previous experience and incorporates that into the narrative. The villain is someone we’ve seen before (Sean Harris’ Lane, who made it his mission to eliminate the IMF in “Rogue Nation”). There’s a veiled reference to Vanessa Redgrave’s character from the first movie, a poignant coda to the romance with Michelle Monaghan from “M:i:III,” and an extension of that sexy spy-who-loved-me dynamic with MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) from the last movie. And the masks are back in a big way — a silly, credibility-straining contrivance in the 1996 movie, in which any character could rip off his face at any time to reveal someone else underneath. Now, they function as a kind of nostalgia. When CIA director Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) snipes, “IMF is Halloween — a bunch of grown men in rubber masks playing trick or treat,” she’s not wrong, and yet, that cheeky ability to impersonate anyone is basically the thing that sets “Mission: Impossible” apart. These are movies that dare you to believe your eyes, doubling down by insisting on doing many of the risky maneuvers practically, in camera. Maybe you thought you’d seen it all. Hunt has climbed sheer rock faces, driven high-speed motorcycles, and dodged exploding helicopters. But the scenery has never been more spectacular, whether he’s standing atop the chimney of the Tate Modern with all of London laid out before him or parachuting onto the glass roof of Paris’ Grand Palais — whose pristine white bathrooms supply the more memorable scene. The latter provides a strangely homoerotic encounter between Hunt and CIA assassin August Walker (“Man of Steel” star Henry Cavill, looking chiseled, if not terribly charismatic) as they attempt to corner a nefarious arms dealer named John Lark in the cruisey men’s room. In “Fallout,” the mission is clear: Recover three plutonium cores before Lark and a terrorist organization known as the Apostles can use them to target the Vatican, Jerusalem, and Mecca in a single coordinated attack. But McQuarrie makes things complicated quick, allowing the payload to go missing and putting Hunt and his team — Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) — in a desperate race to recover the nuclear devices before they can be used. The trick is to steer the action through scenic locations, orchestrating outdoor chases whenever possible (there’s one through Paris that rivals the breakneck pursuit of the elevated train in “The French Connection,” this time on French soil) while finding creative ways to keep the stakes grounded in relationships that have been firmly established in the previous films. Although Cruise’s character never comes right out and says the words, “I’m getting too old for this shit,” the film demonstrates why he simply can’t stop accepting impossible missions, going as far as to explain why his marriage to Michelle Monaghan’s character from the third movie couldn’t last (during their brief period of bliss, she was left to wonder, “Who’s watching the world while he’s watching me?”). Hunt may be almost maniacally suicidal in his stunts — leaping off rooftops without looking, rushing through intersections at top speed, dangling from heights where the slightest miscalculation would mean certain death — but as long as she’s alive (and that now goes for Ilsa as well), he’ll risk it all to protect them. Just when you thought you knew who Ethan Hunt was, McQuarrie goes and redefines what makes him tick. And ticking is what the “Mission: Impossible” movies are all about, after all, from those self-destructing assignment messages to the series’ signature, pulse-quickening score (reinvented here in brilliant ways by composer Lorne Balfe, with completely surprising instruments and orchestrations that barely allow a moment’s calm) to the 15-minute countdown clock on a pair of nuclear devices that comprises the film’s finale. Compared with Cruise’s other franchise antihero, the thoroughly grizzled and relatively nihilistic Jack Reacher, Hunt is a regular Boy Scout, a clean-cut, against-all-odds action star who hesitates when forced to decide between sparing one life or saving millions. As far as Hunt’s IMF boss (Alec Baldwin) is concerned, that’s an asset. But it also fits with Cruise’s image as a moralistic matinee idol, a figure whose unrelenting perfectionism ensures that he’ll save the day, even with one second to spare. We elect movie stars the way we do world leaders, buying tickets instead of casting ballots, and the reason Cruise has remained on top for more consecutive terms than Vladimir Putin is that he represents a kind of best-case American: homecoming-king hunky, a hero with a conscience, unwavering in his convictions. Here, the villain is cynicism itself — not just Lane but the mysterious Lark, who has written a manifesto that insists the world has become so corrupt, it must face an act of great tragedy in order to bring about newfound peace. There are those within the government who agree with him, including rival/partner Walker, who clearly holds less regard for human life than Hunt does. They are an exciting pair, each tasked with recovering the plutonium, yet plenty distrustful of one another — Walker belongs to the “Make America great again” school, while Hunt may as well be asking, “Who said it’s not great as it is?” — and that creates a sense of anticipation as we brace ourselves for the moment in which these two uneasy comrades will ultimately have to face off in a fight that’s every bit as philosophical as it is physical. McQuarrie and “Annihilation” DP Rob Hardy mesh well together, establishing the least intrusive technique the franchise has seen so far. McQuarrie has the confidence to let the material speak for itself instead of imposing his style the way someone like John Woo did. A decade ago, around the same time the “Mission: Impossible” series was starting to feel tired, director Paul Greengrass pioneered an aggressive, almost disorienting handheld template for the Jason Bourne movies that threatened to render classical action obsolete. But McQuarrie believes in creating coherent set-pieces: His combat scenes are tense, muscular, and clean, shot and edited in such a way that the spatial geography makes sense. He places audiences just over Cruise’s shoulder, or staring into the actor’s face as he grimaces with exertion. Ethan Hunt has never met an impossible mission, and yet, for the thrill to work, audiences need to believe that this one could get away from him. Here, with everything that he’s ever cared about on the line, Hunt proves why he’s summer’s most valuable action hero.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018",The action here represents the mainstream cinema's version of extreme sports and these guys have staked their claim at the summit.,POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," That energy sustains almost the entirety of Fallout. Directed by Rogue Nation's Christopher McQuarrie, Fallout does nothing if not cement Mission: Impossible as the greatest franchise we currently have, and manages it by leaning fully into the near-demented earnestness given tangible shape in Cruise's running. It hurtles along at such a breakneck speed that it might as well combust, and that even talking about it almost feels like spoiling it, as the temptation is to name every insane set piece in simple awe. Granted, that pacing isn't entirely consistent — following a prologue that pretty neatly encapsulates just how crazy (and great) the franchise is, the film has to pause to set every piece of the game into play. But even then, it's fun, in part due to the easy chemistry of the core team. There's Hunt, and then Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) to round out the crew. The wrench in the works this time around is CIA agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), who's been sent along to ensure that Hunt doesn't once again go rogue. Walker isn't given quite as much to do as the last film's straight man, William Brandt (Jeremy Renner, sitting this one out), which is less a reflection on Cavill, who acquits himself well, and more a symptom of the way that Ethan Hunt has become a force of nature rather than just a man. The Mission: Impossible films aren't superhero movies by the conventional definition of the genre, but they might as well be for how unstoppable Hunt seems to be, and for the way that Hunt's place in the world has gone from ""the living manifestation of destiny,"" as per Rogue Nation, to pretty much the one man keeping the entire world from falling apart. It's a ridiculous notion, but delivered in such a heartfelt fashion that it's difficult to laugh at it, especially given how Hunt does indeed seem to accomplish the impossible as he pursues the terrorist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). And Harris, for his part, is a fitting counterpart to Cruise, as his intensity as an actor is perhaps the only thing in the film to match Cruise's energy. Unfortunately, he's kept mostly on the sidelines, which is equal parts a result of the plot, the expanding cast, and way that the franchise has essentially set Ethan Hunt up as something of a cosmic entity. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing — I'm under the faint impression that Hunt would probably win in a fight against the sun should he so wish to, but Cruise somehow manages to keep him grounded. Hunt takes a few tumbles; 22 years have passed since the first Mission: Impossible hit theaters, and it's not a stretch of time that the franchise has forgotten about. The key is that he keeps going. That's become part of the magic of the franchise. Mission: Impossible isn't Game of Thrones, i.e. Ethan Hunt isn't about to be killed off (or is he?), but watching him attempt the impossible is still heart-stopping. There's no other series of films that's been as consistently able to provoke a physical reaction from its audience — as Fallout ramped up, I not only heard laughs, gasps, and cheers, but saw people recoil, jump, and cover their eyes as Hunt's antics grew more and more extreme. It's a complete, delirious delight. Though, by the end, Fallout is verging on complete fantasy and/or Cruise-centered magical realism, it doesn't require suspension of disbelief as much as it bakes it into the experience. Buying a ticket for a Mission: Impossible movie means surrendering to its specific brand of charm — the same charm to watching Cruise run so fast that it seems he might just take flight.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Pretty much everything is terrible right now, but at least there’s some wild, bravura blockbuster filmmaking either clueless or sly enough to try and make us forget that. Mission: Impossible — Fallout (opening July 27) is about anarchists trying to fix the world by destroying it, and yet these dark questions about civilization’s survival are met with bright and cracking wit. Writer-director Christopher McQuarrie ratchets his movie—and the M:I franchise—up to a mad pitch, then revels in a whirling, controlled-chaos unraveling. In ragged times, the sophisticated derring-do of Fallout is a welcome gift, a slick and studio-polished adventure that nonetheless has the undermining wink of transgression. The movie’s nerve and moxie successfully make us forget its corporate overlords, and all those other oligarchs grinding millions of American lives into nothing. Whew! That got a little dark. Which conversations about Fallout shouldn’t, really. The movie is a full-tilt blast, a direct sequel to 2015’s Rogue Nation that rewards a familiarity with that film but also knows that its plot’s chief function is to deliver grand set pieces. Which isn’t to say the movie is without narrative weight. It’s just that whatever details from the last one you’ve forgotten or never knew to begin with are quickly smoothed away. True to the medium, the movie almost never stops, well, moving—and in that aerodynamic charge a coherent enough plot takes shape, one that has Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) examining the nature of his commitment to all this world-saving, while pretty much everyone around him regards him as the lunatic he is. But what a dependable lunatic. Who could have guessed that the Mission: Impossible franchise, of all the franchises, would have such staying power, somehow getting better as it aged. In expanding its scope beyond the original film’s gizmo tradecraft, the series surely should have become too similar to every other bloated, idea-less action spectacular. And yet through canny choices in directors—J.J. Abrams, Brad Bird, now McQuarrie—the franchise has found a surprising creative groove, toying with physics in an amiable game of one-upmanship that has yielded dazzling results. In Fallout, Cruise—whose devotion to stunt work is as crucial to these films as anything else—jumps out of a high-altitude plane and hangs from a helicopter as it whips over the mountains of Kashmir, daring us to consider that his work on these films might only be finished when one of them actually kills him. (This one nearly did.) Cruise’s crazy gusto dovetails neatly with Ethan Hunt’s, and Fallout runs swiftly, as the franchise has, on those twin engines of intensity. The trailers for Fallout have largely showcased the helicopter stuff, which is a beguiling and ludicrous bit of action filmmaking. But I’m even more enamored of what comes before, particularly an extended sequence set in sunny, springtime Paris, a long kidnapping and pursuit that is remarkable for how deceptively lo-fi and simple it is. McQuarrie doesn’t introduce anything new to the chase scene, exactly, but he stages one with tireless verve, pushing the scene past its seemingly natural ending and then again past that. We’re giddy and exhausted by the time the thing has concluded, only to be swept up in the movie’s next exhilarating clause, which is nothing more or less exciting than Tom Cruise running across the rooftops of London. He’s the best runner in movies, and Fallout is wise to give his tight little stride its proper due. There’s a sense of Christopher Nolan’s macro dramatics at work in Fallout. McQuarrie films with a gliding insistence similar to much of The Dark Knight’s looming urban warfare, and Lorne Balfe’s score swells and thrums and booms in similarly epic proportions. He’s an acolyte of Nolan familiar Hans Zimmer, a fact you can hear in every chord that approaches “bwaaamp.” But Balfe does his own thing too, particularly in his use of percussion, snares and bongos that create a jaunty staccato momentum. And McQuarrie keeps his film lighter than Nolan has ever been able to (or interested in). I like the occasional heaviness of Fallout, its moody reveries. But the film is not too steeped in that seriousness, either. It’s a movie with stakes, but compartmentalized ones, as if the end of society and the corrosion of personal ethics were merely manageable parts of a problem, rather than all we’ve been freaking out about for the last 18 months. Which is a nice, if deluding, idea. I’m not that eager to try to pick apart what constitutes politics in Fallout, because I’m not sure what I’d find beyond a kind of recursive Möbius strip, referencing its own spy logic to justify all its spy action. I’m sure one could draw parallels between Fallout’s world saviorism and, say, the Avengers’ version of the same—but could we maybe just enjoy this one thing on its more visceral merits for a bit? I realize that’s a lazy, problematic ask these days. But Fallout is such bracing entertainment that I’d like to linger in its gleeful rattle a little longer before context comes crashing in. That seems to be how Cruise most successfully operates these days, when he’s relegated himself to the trusted stuff that works, far away from whatever we do or don’t know about his personal life. He’s aces in the film, half cocked and half confident, letting us see some sweat and desperation to offset—and complement, really—his ropey competence. He’s supported ably by Henry Cavill in arch-hunk mode and series mainstay Ving Rhames, who gets to do some genuine emoting in a pair of scenes that have a poignant charge. (Fallout finds an emotional core underneath its sleek shell, one just gooey enough—when underscored by Balfe’s surging strings—to prove sincerely affecting.) Rebecca Ferguson returns as British assassin Ilsa Faust, getting a little less to do this go-around, but still acting as a sturdy foil for Cruise. He’s also paired with a slinking Vanessa Kirby, as an upscale arms broker, in a few crackling scenes. One hopes Kirby will be asked back for the next outing. For surely there will be a next outing. Though Fallout has some definitive conclusions, it leaves Ethan’s world open enough to invite in whatever other new criminal catastrophe might await. If the antics are as dizzyingly high-grade as Fallout’s, I eagerly welcome the next installment. McQuarrie’s film is the most fun you’re likely to have at the movies this season, a riot mounted with precision, a melee in which every punch and crunch is considered. I worry for Cruise’s safety should he continue to make these films, but he at least seems to be in the best possible hands. What a thrill to watch our old movie-star hero tossed around willy-nilly—but carefully. And all in service of showing us a good time! That generosity is more than appreciated.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018","Fallout is a worthy addition to the franchise and a fast pace thrill-ride. McQuarrie manages to keep the story, stunts, and structure fresh, which makes me wonder if he has another one in him.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," The Mission: Impossible movies have been on a steady rise since at least the third movie. Just when you think Rogue Nation may have been too tough an act to follow, Fallout takes it to yet another level. Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise)’s latest mission is to retrieve enough plutonium to make three nuclear bombs. The CIA saddles him with babysitter Agent Walker (Henry Cavill), and his rendezvous with the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) reveals a plan involving Rogue Nation femme fatale Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) and villain Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). By six movies in, it must be hard to find impossible things to challenge Ethan Hunt. So it’s rather clever to give him a fire he has to put out in Walker.  Ethan would have the perfect solution to this plan, but Walker sabotages it by trying to help. He doesn’t even get it when Ethan saves him. Another great new motivation for Ethan the sixth time out is that situations continue to force him to choose between lives. Ethan can’t bear to sacrifice any innocent lives to stop the villains. So he finds new ways to save them all. It’s a profound philosophical take in a genre that could easily be shoot ‘em up carnage. Those are fun too, but Mission: Impossible – Fallout shows that you can achieve greater good if you work as hard at it as Ethan Hunt. Ethan agrees to these Sophie’s Choice missions before he even has a plan, because he knows he’ll figure it out. And that’s really philosophically how it works. Decide you’re going to save everybody, then the solution presents itself. Doubt yourself and it won’t. But man oh man, when Ethan starts running, that’s just the YAS moment. Everybody loves to watch Tom Cruise run, so they make it an enormous rooftop chase over London. The climax is a helicopter chase like I’ve never seen before. It really builds the tension so that just when you think it’s reached the tautest, they pull the rug out a little more.  The final chase begins with Cruise climbing a rope dangling from a helicopter. I’m impressed by anybody who can climb a rope on land, let alone in mid-air. It only gets crazier from there. The helicopter portion fills the full IMAX frame, including shots from inside the helicopter as they’re flipping around and around. It’s hard to film with IMAX cameras outside. How did they get them IN the helicopters??? Without spoiling the twists and turns of the plot, I hope the above makes a strong case for seeing Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Just imagine, there’s all that and a rousing caper with Benji (Simon Pegg) and Luther (Ving Rhames) too!",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," The summer is supposedly the time of year for “dumb action movies.” Some films these days even seem to wear that description as a badge of honor. “This stuff’s not supposed to make you think! Just turn your brain off and enjoy!” Not the Mission: Impossibles. They stand out in a crowded summer marketplace because they are smart action movies: Cleverly plotted and ingeniously constructed, with sharp dialogue, surprising twists, and inventive set pieces that flow effortlessly and relentlessly from one to the next. The last two Missions have been directed by their writer, Christopher McQuarrie, and they feel like the work of a filmmaker with a screenwriting background. They are not just vapid excuses for explosions and gunplay; they’re actual stories with real characters, and the action builds organically from their struggles. If you turn your brain off in one of McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible movies, you’ll miss some of the best stuff. His latest is called Mission: Impossible – Fallout, although Mission: Suicide would have worked too given how absurdly dangerous the stunts look and how high the stakes are this time for Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and his Impossible Mission Force. They’re on the trail of a trio of nuclear weapons stolen by a group of evil spies known as “The Apostles.” They want to tear down society in order to build a new, better world. Hunt and his IMF backup Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) will need to locate the warheads, along with the Apostles mysterious leader John Lark, all while being shadowed by a CIA agent (Henry Cavill) who distrusts Hunt and thinks the IMF’s unorthodox methods and old-fashioned morality represent the real threat to world peace. There is something charmingly retro about Ethan Hunt and his refusal to sacrifice even one innocent life to preserve millions of others – as is the earnestness with which McQuarrie and Cruise put forward their message about saving the world without sacrificing your principles. A movie based on a 50-year-old TV show is the perfect delivery vehicle for that sort of message, and Cruise, who’s been making Mission: Impossible movies for 20 years, adapting each one to the tastes of their time without adjusting Hunt’s values even an iota, is its perfect messenger. The first Mission: Impossible, directed by Brian De Palma, was largely a stylish update and expansion of the old television series about a loose collection of covert operatives. Around the fourth Mission the film franchise began to mutate into something different, one in which the title seemed to refer equally to Ethan Hunt and to Cruise himself, along with his insatiable need to one-up himself with new death-defying feats. It’s hard to believe he could ever top dangling off the side of the tallest building in the world, as he did in the centerpiece sequence of Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol, but Fallout’s bravura finale might actually do it. It features three different threads of parallel action, including Tom Cruise dangling from a helicopter’s skids hundreds of feet off the ground and piloting a chopper in a breathless chase. The fate of the entire world is at stake, along with the lives of several crucial characters we care dearly about. From top to bottom, it is spectacular. And that’s not even the part of Fallout where Tom Cruise actually jumps off a building, breaking his ankle in the process. (That shot’s in the movie, as is the next shot, where Cruise drags his broken body onto the roof and clears camera before collapsing so he wouldn’t have to do another take on one leg.) While Fallout is still very much The Tom Cruise Does Reckless Things For Our Amusement Show, the film’s ensemble is superb as well. Cavill is a great foil for Cruise, and Rhames and Pegg have cultivated a perfect banter rhythm after years of making these movies. Alec Baldwin has most of Fallout’s best lines as Hunt’s new boss, and Angela Bassett is lovably stern as the latest in a long line of bureaucrats who distrust the IMF (the last one was played by Alec Baldwin; he eventually had a change of heart). Rebecca Ferguson, who joined the franchise in McQuarrie’s Rogue Nation as the mysterious British agent Ilsa Faust, also makes a welcome return to perplex and tantalize Hunt again. Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation was McQuarrie’s biggest project as a director to date, and at times he seemed a little overmatched by the demands of a gigantic action spectacle. His direction of Fallout feels far more comfortable and confident, not to mention much more clear; a bathroom brawl between Hunt, Walker, and a key bad guy, for example, might be the best fistfight in any of the six Mission: Impossibles. And McQuarrie’s uncommonly good at parceling out plot information. He knows precisely what to tell you and what to hide, what to let you think you know, and when to surprise you by revealing you were wrong all along. (He is the guy who wrote The Usual Suspects, after all.) McQuarrie’s control of pacing is impressive too. Almost every previous Mission: Impossible peaked early; their best action sequences typically came at their midpoints, and their finales became a little anticlimactic. Fallout starts relatively slowly and builds to that nail-biting, jaw-dropping helicopter climax. While Cruise is known for his onscreen sprints, Fallout is more of a marathon; once Hunt gets his mission briefing, the film rarely lets up for the next two and a half hours. You have to be pretty smart to put together this kind of intricate puzzle, and to sustain it in such shamelessly entertaining fashion. Cruise and his legendary intensity have now sustained the Mission: Impossible franchise for over 20 years. And after two decades, Fallout might be the finest film in the series. (To me, it’s a toss-up between this and Ghost Protocol.) Either way, Mission: Impossible is clearly the best ongoing action franchise in the world. And nothing else even comes close. Additional Thoughts:-Between Ilsa Faust, Hunt’s long-suffering (but largely absent) wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan), and returning bad guy Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), Fallout is probably the most direct sequel in the franchise. You don’t need to see Rogue Nation to follow it, but it helps.",POSITIVE
"Jul 12, 2018"," Christopher McQuarrie’s Mission: Impossible – Fallout boils down to two defining takeaways. One: Ethan Hunt’s latest probably-not-literally-impossible assignment feels *every second* of its nearly 150-minute runtime. Two: action sequences hit harder than Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet haymaker. That cocked-and-locked forearms gif of Henry Cavill y’all have been virally enjoying *still* doesn’t adequately sell the big-stick-swingin’ attitude of this mile-a-minute espionage heart-racer. Planning gets complicated and scripted twists ball a knot of complexity, but you’d have to be a corpse not to enjoy the film’s “impossible” adrenaline rush. Which, I can only assume, is second to the giddiness Tom Cruise experiences when risking his life for another unforgettable stunt. Ethan Hunt’s (Tom Cruise) latest objective, which he chooses to accept, is simple – recover three plutonium orbs before Solomon Lane’s (Sean Harris) remaining soldiers (referred to as The Apostles) can carry out their weaponized destruction. Things go according to plan for all of five minutes, then Hunt chooses to save partners Luther (Ving Rhames) and Benji (Simon Pegg) over securing his radioactive payload. IMF’s highly-combustible bounty vanishes into the night, so Secretary Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) sends the team back into action…with a babysitter. CIA hardass Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) demands her most qualified fixer – August Walker (Henry Cavill) – tag along for insurance. Then MI6 agent Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) resurfaces. And there’s an underground broker codenamed White Widow (Vanessa Kirby)? Plus, how can you tell who’s who with IMF’s rubberized “Halloween” mask obsession? Take a deep breath, abandon desires to dissect, and get ready for Mission: Impossible – Fallout to bring the motherflippin’ THUNDER. That’s why you’re here, and McQuarrie makes good by cranking “kickass” dials to 13 only to have Cavill punch ‘em all into oblivion. Fallout’s chronology (surprisingly) picks up right where Rogue Nation left off. Lane’s syndicate – while he’s passed around in custody – has evolved into extreme radicalism and Hunt’s past relationships (Ilsa especially) come roaring back. Fallout is a ripple effect that spreads from Hunt’s decision to keep Lane alive, which McQuarrie uses to muster further hero development. Ethan Hunt keeps the world safe first and foremost, which is why once-wife/forever love Julia (Michelle Monaghan) had to leave. In this respect, Hunt’s shown as more than the laser-dodging, airplane-door-riding maniac who just “figures it out.” Human attributes crack his hardened outline, prodding a “softer” side by ensuring teammates live through ambushes unlike Cavill’s “leave no trace” professionalism. We see more of Hunt than normal, but it’s at a price. Mission: Impossible – Fallout throws [insert exaggerated number] possible endpoints at audiences and elongates already inflated tactical designs with roadblocks galore. At minutes shy of two-and-a-half-hours, progression seems to be in a constant state of flux where double-crosses or three-steps-ahead admissions balk at “seeing is believing.” Everyone quietly stashes contingency breakdowns, along with last-ditch contingencies when the primary contingencies implode – and I get it. These are government-issue superspies who’d rather eat a bullet than fail. But McQuarrie’s incessant swerving forms a circular logic that cycles in repetitive motions. Admittedly, it’s easy enough to just give up and enjoy high-stakes beatdowns, but the unexpected becomes ordinary to the point of being stuck in a teasing bullets-and-interrogations purgatory. Once you stop trying to guess who’s in on what, McQuarrie’s orchestrated overload of dodge-and-weave awesomeness is easy to appreciate. Camerawork may be fixated on Tom Cruise’s profile to remind the 50+-year-old does all his own crackpot stunts, but he’s not stealing any scenes. Henry Cavill is Cruise’s superior in every way, with his springy hair coils bouncing as Walker bodyslams targets through European nightclub mirrors. Rebecca Ferguson dodges traffic like Frogger 10.0 while motorcycling and gets some serious acrobatic air when forcing opponents to submit (aka choke out). And even Vanessa Kirby draws attention when she whips out a butterfly knife and instantly reminds us of Elizabeth Debicki as “White Widow” helps Hunt fight out of a crowded lounge bar jam-packed with greedy contract killers. One shot where Ferguson, Cruise, Cavill and Kirby all exit a room after having just front-kicked and stabbed their way through danger – disheveled but still effortlessly polished – skipped my heart three beats. That superteam, sauntering unfazed and in unison, had me *begging* for more of their buddy-system assassinations. Bless Benji and Luther, but me-oh-my these four could topple entire monarchies if they wanted to. Alas, here’s my biggest issue: pitting Cavill and Cruise as frenemies who *might* tussle (yes, they do) is a wee bit far-fetched. Cruise puts other mid-50s actioners to shame, but Cavill is an Adonis. Brawn, scruff and unmovable body mass. In no way do I see them as direct competition, but let’s just say Mission: Impossible – Fallout takes laughable liberties. Kirby pining over Cruise as she gets her kicks while they practically dance their way through action choreography? I buy it – their electric chemistry could power Chernobyl. All the witnessless rooms and pedestrian free walkways? Why not. But a worn-down Cruise going toe-to-toe with Superman for Krypton’s sake? No comparison. Cruise proves impressively capable be it tempting deadlier and deadlier stuntman fates or *still* saving the world in tight-black clothing, but Cavill’s casting is a step too far. He’s perfect for damn sure as an American cleaner with zero eraser protocol hesitation, just not believable for Cruise’s arch-whatever. That said, Cavill’s go-time performance is handsomely glorious. Doubling down with Cruise to shatter bathroom stalls while trying to incapacitate a particularly feisty mark. Fighting on the side of a goshdang cliff after his helicopter goes all Jurassic Park by dropping down rock formations like Tim’s Explorer. Deadlocking his eyes, calculating morbid costs, or even cracking a joke after *almost dying* thanks to his own HALO jump stupidity. Angela Bassett thinks she can control her loyal pet, but Cavill’s heavy-gun-holder owns Mission: Impossible – Fallout. Tom Cruise isn’t the Ethan Hunt he once was, but that doesn’t stop…well, anything. Mission: Impossible – Fallout is still a decibel-shattering seismic burst of punch-into-gear entertainment from sophisticated brawling to speedster vehicle chases around such landmarks as France’s Arc de Triomphe. Cruise surrounds himself with a marketable supporting crew ready for however many lumps and bruises it takes, and that’s what Christopher McQuarrie should be most thankful for. Those who can tangle with Cruise and find common ground, even when physical imposition declares otherwise. Might the franchise’s star be a bit long in the tooth for Ethan Hunt at this point? Given how worn-down and overmatched Mr. Impossible looks at times (while *still* pleasing crowds), I’d say he’s earned some relaxation and rights to produce a rebooted cast. For a last hurrah, Mission: Impossible – Fallout would be a notoriously noble bow.",POSITIVE
