"Apr 19, 2024","Oppenheimer is ultimately a cautionary tale about ego, politics, and power, a true, modern epic.",POSITIVE
"Apr 7, 2024"," As increasing tensions with Russia rise once again, it seems fitting that Oppenheimer sets forth the events that led to those initial tensions in aftermath of World War II. For too many, the Cold War still haunts their memories of fallout shelters and threats of nuclear annihilation and that fear stems from one event, the creation of the atomic bomb. Brought in by the U.S. government hoping to beat Nazi Germany to the punch of creating one, they choose one of the foremost theoretical physicists in the world, in spite of his wide travels of Europe. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a brilliant scientist, but his curiosity and desire to advance technology lead him on a collision course with history. This film follows Oppenheimer from his time as a young physics student to the head of the Manhattan Project as he works with some of the leading scientists in the world to put together a nuclear weapon to his post-Hiroshima/Nagasaki efforts to foster nuclear disarmament, which earned him a secret investigation that brought down the man who orchestrated it, Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). There’s a lot of ground to cover in this 3-hour biopic, but director Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job of keeping things moving while skillfully explaining to the audience some of the more esoteric concepts on display. Writing your own screenplay like Nolan has gives you an intimate knowledge of the subject matter, but it also keeps you from seeing some of the flaws. While it’s a lot of years to go over, it still feels like it drags a bit through its middle hour. Still, most of his more excessive tendencies, the ones that marred films like Interstellar are kept thankfully in check. The slow realization that Oppenheimer makes about the destructiveness of his efforts might sit poorly with audiences who expect him to come to understand its devastating capabilities sooner. However, as an early scene with him trying to poison his professor shows, it isn’t until after a lot of dwelling that he comes to that conclusion and attempts to rectify it. At that point, perhaps it’s too late, especially against an administration desperate to label him as a malcontent and a foreign spy. The film’s performances are all solid, especially Murphy in the lead role. His shift from wide-eyed optimist to cog in the political machine to anti-nuclear activist is convincing with the toll of years weighing heavily on his face. Nolan has always known how to use Murphy well and he might well have given him the role of his career. That’s not to demean anyone else in the film. Downey Jr., Josh Hartnett, and Florence Pugh all deliver strong performances. Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife has some great scenes, but they build up almost out of nowhere. Her third act emergence as a key emotional force of anger in the film feels disingenuous. It’s an underwritten role for an actor who deserves better. That said, there is an utter sour note in the film and its the cameo of Gary Oldman as President Harry S. Truman. His scenery chewing abomination is tacky.Truman was oft said to have defended the decision to save hundreds of thousands of lives by dropping the bomb, but that decision-making process is given short shrift and the nuance of any such event is marred by the flippant dismissal of Oppenheimer. It’s a crass moment that wasn’t needed at least not without more context, even if rooted in strong anecdotal evidence.  Anyone leaving this film should take to heart Oppenheimer’s quote recited twice in the film. The first is as the optimist sharing conjugal relations with Pugh’s character, reciting from the Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” It is an instructive quote for if his character did not fully understand its salience upon its first utterance, his late-film use of the phrase drives the point home effectively. Oppenheimer is a film about cycles and patterns, such as what Oppenheimer himself attempted to bring to theoretical physics and ultimately to applied physics. His theories are scientific brilliance, but the end result is incredibly tragic. It exemplifies not just the difficulty of advancing technology without harming others but also the challenge of coming to terms with what’s created afterwards. It takes a noble mind to recognize one’s culpability in that and this film enables the viewer to recognize that and honor Oppenheimer’s legacy however challenging it might be.",POSITIVE

"Mar 24, 2024","  Cillian Murphy gives an incomparable virtuosic portrayal of the man responsible for creating the Atom Bomb. Murphy’s fierce performance is astonishing for its purposeful sense of moral clarity.  The film could stand to lose at least 30 minutes of its overlong runtime, and then it might be three stars, but there isn't a masterpiece here to be carved from its original stone.

"Mar 8, 2024"," There are moments that change everything. The detonation of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima is arguably one of those moments: the birth of a weapon of untold destructive power. For the first time, mankind had the potential to destroy the world in a matter of hours, if not minutes. Oppenheimer (2023) tells the story of the creation the bomb and the man who spearheaded the project. Cillian Murphy plays Robert J. Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who put together the team and masterminded the architecture of the Manhattan Project. Thin and weary looking, with an impassive expression and bright blue eyes that are a well of determination and worry, Murphy incarnates Oppenheimer as a man driven. As a Jewish-American, he feels a duty to stop Hitler and the Third Reich at all costs, and he fears that Nazi scientists are already ahead of the rest of the world in their project to harness atomic energy. But there is also the pioneer spirit of a scientist conquering the next frontier, putting the theoretical into practice in an unprecedented way. Nolan gives us the sweep of his complicated life—the film spans decades and features scores of characters—as it delves into the history, the politics, and the morality around it. He wrote the screenplay (based on the biography by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) and hews to the historical record, and there is a lot going on: a marriage (Emily Blunt plays his often frustrated wife) and family dragged around and often neglect in his odyssey, friendships tested by his zealousness, the tug-of-war between politics, military expediency, and scientific possibility. And, true to form, Nolan jumps around key periods, helping us keep the eras straight with different styles. It’s challenging, to be sure, but not daunting. For a film so enmeshed in ideas and loaded with meeting and conversations and debates (scientific and moral), it is as visually compelling as it is narratively. Nolan is a filmmaker who has commanded huge budgets and production resources. He made Oppenheimer on a relatively smaller budget, at least compared to previous production, and creates an epic of sorts that never shows signs of compromise. And for that first test detonation in the desert, he displays the power and fury of the atomic explosion without recourse to digital effects. It’s a remarkable way to evoke the power of splitting atoms unleashing the fury of the gods. Matt Damon is General Leslie Groves, who gambles on Oppenheimer and backs him against the government’s wariness of his past politics, and Robert Downey Jr. the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, a wily political player whose resentment of Oppenheimer drives efforts to discredit the scientist once the war is over. They are the most consequential supporting players in a massive cast and it’s to Nolan’s credit that even the smaller supporting roles carve out their own place in the story: Kenneth Branagh as Dutch physicist Niels Bohr, Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock (who had a long affair with Oppenheimer), Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. There’s also David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Benny Safdie, and Casey Affleck, just to scratch the surface. It won seven Academy Awards, including best picture, director, actor for Cillian Murphy, and supporting actor for Robert Downey Jr., and Nolan won best director awards from the Director’s Guild and the New York Film Critics Circle.

"Mar 8, 2024"," Writers’ lives as depicted in French films continue to be things of great mystery, and I don’t mean murder mystery. In Justine Triet’s Anatomy of a Fall, a married, middle-aged writer couple (Sandra Hüller and Samuel Theis) seems overly involved in rap fandom. Their dog is named Snoop and husband Samuel “often,” according to wife Sandra, plays an instrumental steel-drum version of 50 Cent’s “P.I.M.P.” at full volume while doing home repairs on their massive A-frame in the French Alps. The day he falls out a window and dies—accidentally, a suicide, murdered by Sandra, who knows?—he’s blaring it “on a loop.” The film will go on to pester us with this track five times during various flashbacks and trial scenes. It comes across as a weird joke or a prank Triet is playing that has some meaning for her but not for us. It’s not mischievous like the repetition of “California Dreamin’” in Chungking Express because Anatomy of a Fall is otherwise po-faced. By the end, any sympathy we might have had for Samuel evaporates with these “P.I.M.P.” needle drops. They make him into a ridiculous man, and after 152 minutes it’s a great relief not that Sandra has been exonerated of his murder, but that we won’t have to hear those steel drums again. Triet’s previous film, Sibyl (2019), was agile, witty, and original. This one is prosaic, as if an article from The Cut about the domestic lives of writers has been crossed with an episode of Law & Order. If only an expert like Ice-T had shown up in the courtroom scenes to push stop on “P.I.M.P.” and explain things to the judge: “Somebody try to bust my eardrums, I’m gonna bust their ass.” The writer couple (Greta Lee and John Magaro) in Celine Song’s debut feature, Past Lives, are younger, less established, and blander than the one in Anatomy of a Fall. Residents of a not-great apartment in the Lower East Side, they don’t have much in the way of personality. Nora is Korean and a playwright, Arthur a white-guy novelist who has written a novel called Boner. If Nora can be said to have a characteristic, it is her desire to win literary prizes. She has left her successful arty parents behind in South Korea “because Koreans don’t win the Nobel Prize for Literature.” She also dreams of winning a Pulitzer and a Tony. This seemed dated and contrived, since Koreans do win Oscars. Pretending Nora is not a screenwriter-director like her creator, or might become one, is a deflection after Parasite’s success in 2020. The film is more literature than cinema, elevated mumblecore for graduate writing seminars, the opposite of, for instance, Hong Sangsoo, who makes low-budget films about writers and filmmakers without worrying about prizes, and whose films don’t seem written at all. With its expensive-looking cinematography, Slowdive-sounding score, and fancy editing, Past Lives is designed to win awards, which it has. Like Nora, Celine Song made a conscious choice to leave one life behind and start another. Her film is the result of a series of other professional choices, too, and it shows. It is hard to understand the decisions that went into Cord Jefferson’s adaptation of Percival Everett’s unique and startling novel Erasure but, with the exception of the cast, they were decisions that don’t work. American Fiction is watered-down, unexciting, and nonabrasive. Its unclever title is an example of the film’s basic strategy, which is to take material that might offend people, material that was in fact designed to offend people, and update it for a world that demands to not be offended. Though it’s topped with an inconclusive series of postmodern codas, this is a family comedy with Hallmark touches. When the main character, Thelonious “Monk” Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a beleaguered Black novelist, announces early in the movie that he doesn’t believe in race, I didn’t think that meant he wanted to be in My Big Fat Greek Wedding. The twin worlds of publishing and Hollywood are mocked here, without ever looking or feeling anything like those worlds do in real life. The ersatz quality of it all extends to the music on the soundtrack. Why hire the great Patrice Rushen to play gentle jazz piano over everything, in a score she didn’t write herself? An earlier meta-scene, in which we see Keith David and Okieriete Onaodowan as a stereotypical drunk father and gangbanger son acting out scenes in Ellison’s deliberately bad novel, and arguing with him about how corny and exploitative they are, is a good idea, but it’s truncated, maybe because it hits too close to what Jefferson is doing himself. The direct criticism of other movies in that scene and in other parts of American Fiction is dubious, too. Are we supposed to think Boyz N the Hood is a bad movie now? It’s a thousand times better than this one. Jeffrey Wright seems held back in American Fiction. The same cannot be said of Paul Giamatti, who plays a lonely, bitter classics teacher at a New England prep school in Alexander Payne’s The Holdovers. Fitted with one wall-eye contact lens, Giamatti stares at the corner of the room while fixing what’s left of his gaze on his students, whom he considers recalcitrant philistines, “entitled little degenerates.” Giamatti’s performance is a pleasure to watch. He is the presiding presence in the movie, and David Hemingson’s erudite screenplay allows him free range to deliver long lines of invective. At the same time Giamatti is part of a Three Stooges act with Da’Vine Joy Randolph, as the taciturn manager of the school’s cafeteria, and Dominic Sessa, the one student left behind at the school over Christmas. If this trio seems to shut out the rest of the world and to reduce the other characters in the film to walk-ons, it’s because they are also doing that in their own lives, each trapped alone in various stages of grief. The Holdovers is destined to be a Christmas classic precisely because it is not a feel-good movie. Randolph’s son is a casualty of an unjust war, Sessa’s father is a hopeless mental case with the official Cuckoo’s Nest haircut of institutionalized madness, and Giamatti is denied a happy ending as he drives away from the school with a bottle of pilfered brandy pressed to his lips. The movie isn’t feel-good. Set in 1970, it is nostalgic. Payne and cinematographer Eigil Bryld have given The Holdovers a warm, old-school shot-on film look that the viewer can slip into like a coma. Leonie Benesch gives a sensitive, lively performance in The Teachers’ Lounge as Carla, a young seventh grade teacher in Hamburg. With her two big, functional eyes and her positive attitude, she’s the opposite of Giamatti in The Holdovers. She shows love for her students and a great desire to help them, which she expresses with dance-like physicality in the gym classes she teaches along with her main job, teaching math, an arrangement that would be comic in an American film but in a German one is graceful and nurturing. She’s too good to be true, so of course director İlker Çatak is setting her up for a fall. A series of thefts at the school implicates minority students in the eyes of the other teachers, but Carla suspects one of her colleagues, thereby initiating a series of events that will embroil this place of learning in recriminations, ill will, and chaos. But it’s a lite, low-stakes kind of chaos. The lesson here is that no good deed goes unpunished. The film is a mild version of a Haneke movie, seemingly made for the middle-schoolers who populate it and who are presumably not yet ready for a full-strength Piano Teacher’s lounge. Barbie like no movie before it pushed the limit of what constitutes legitimate news versus what’s free publicity for a pseudo-event designed to rake in money for a large corporation. Obviously Barbie came out ahead, making $1.5 billion worldwide, though even with that haul, Barbie’s parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, somehow lost $3.1 billion in 2023. If their board of directors was on the ball, Margot Robbie and Greta Gerwig would be running the studio, not David Zaslav. The push for Barbie was intense. Its only analogue was the right-wing media’s obsession with Hunter Biden, the MAGA Barbie. CNN.com, which is also owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, published 128 separate news stories about the film. The New York Times published 84 pieces on Barbie, and mentioned Barbie in non-Barbie-related pieces over 450 times. Richard Brody of the New Yorker became Barbie’s Number One fan among film critics, tweeting about Barbie or its principals some three dozen times, including one tweet in French and another that stated that Barbie was a better movie than 2001: A Space Odyssey, “except for the unrivalled Stargate sequence.” Brody had mentioned Barbie as early as February 2020, more than three years before the film came out, in a review of the Robbie-superhero-starrer Birds of Prey, in which he told readers he was “greatly looking forward to her performance in the title role of Barbie, the next film by Greta Gerwig, who, I suspect, will have an altogether more original view of Robbie’s art.” That is what you call advance praise. One CNN.com piece, on how enraging it was to the author that Robbie and Gerwig were not nominated for a Best Actress and Best Director Oscars, stated that the only people who “didn’t love” Barbie were “reactionary right-wing dorks.” When Hillary Clinton weighed in with a punny tweet to console Robbie and Gerwig about the snub, it became clear that Barbie was a form of official art, an item of capitalist realism about which only one set of values should be expressed in public. It was supposed to matter that those values were feminist and not just consumerist. This view and its proponents became clearer for me recently when a cinephile friend told me about how last July she had excused herself from a bachelorette party that included going to see Barbie. She thought she had dodged the pink bullet, but one day in January while she was out she got a couple of texts from her building’s unofficial super, a man in his sixties. “Have you seen Barbie?” the first text asked. “If not, you should. It’s quite clever and funny,” said the second. “I left it on your stair just in case.” When she got home and entered her building, there it was: a Blu-Ray of Barbie borrowed from the local library sitting on the steps to her door. Yorgos Lanthimos is our leading auteur of half-baked ideas, but since he’s begun working with screenwriter Tony McNamara on movies starring Emma Stone, things have started to gel and get moist. Poor Things, a film of “sugar and violence,” is a bizarro Barbie, a forceful, entertaining movie without smugness, featuring a kind of outré production design all its own. Every effect is thrown in: the film is in color and black-and-white, it pushes the use of wide-angle cinematography in new directions, hybrid animals wander about, and mad scientist Willem Dafoe belches floating orb-like bubbles—all this before the film gets to Emma Stone’s Bella, a Victorian wild child chasing mysteries of the organism through an ocean liner’s casino and a Parisian brothel. Dafoe is a disfigured Frankenstein and Stone his messy, demanding monster, a creation that escapes his lab, moves on, and quickly takes over the action. Once she discovers the pleasures of sex (“furious jumping”) with Mark Ruffalo’s louche playboy, she leaves England for Lisbon, a world of fine dining and ballroom dancing where she gets to declare, immortally, “I must go punch that baby.” It was reported that Poor Things looks like a Tim Burton movie. It doesn’t—it’s more like an animated Karel Zeman movie come to life—though it does synthesize almost every Frankenstein movie that came before it. Instead, it’s a film with a true Sadean quality, made for libertines, not Puritans, who will find many opportunities in it to be offended. It’s about time something so wicked was made at such a high level. I’m troubled by writers who never ask themselves, “What if I didn’t do this?” Some things should be passed over in silence. I felt that way last fall when Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour came out in theaters. When I noticed aging male film critics rushing to see this nearly three-hour concert film so they could write about it, I was embarrassed for them. Another kind of movie is also like that to me: musicals based on movies that were not musicals but which became stage musicals, then movies again. I saw the musical version of The Producers when it came out in 2005 and it struck me as inert, laughless, and botched. Since then I have avoided musical versions of Hairspray and Mean Girls, and probably some others I’ve forgotten existed. The new Color Purple movie musical is one of these. It starts well, with a pre-title song called “Huckleberry Pie” performed with delighted charm by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi and Halle Bailey as sisters, accompanied by Colman Domingo as a bluesman cowboy playing banjo on a horse. Set along the Georgia coast amid trees draped in Spanish moss, this number appeared to pay homage to Daughters of the Dust and was directed by Blitz Bazawule in a very up-to-the-minute CGI style that showed a certain flair, like maybe the movie was going to use its artifice to some new advantage other of these musicals had not. As an introductory interlude that evoked life in a rural Black community in 1909, it promised something that was not just hokum. But then the rest of the film was just hokum, and there was a lot of it, with plenty of beatings, especially for poor Celie (Fantasia Barrino) at the hands of Mister (Domingo), who gets his comeuppance and is forgiven, and as an act of contrition decides to wear shimmery “fancy pants” to the big group hug at the end. He looked clownish but as punishments go he got off easy. The brute fact of Killers of the Flower Moon’s three-and-a-half-hour existence is something to be reckoned with, but it also emphasizes how its story is hard to endure. Scorsese’s film is truly novelistic, like a Dreiser novel—which is to say it also has the detail of a silent Stroheim film from the time in which most of it takes place, the late 1910s and 1920s, offering meticulous period set decoration, props, and wardrobe, down to the boots and driving goggles. Once again, as he has been doing at least since Goodfellas in 1990 and up through the more recent Silence and The Irishman, Scorsese presents a mentor relationship in which an older man takes a younger one under his wing so that he can exploit him by making him do his dirty work. Here, this is pushed to its extreme, as it involves the murder of a race—the Osage on their reservation in Oklahoma—and the expropriation of their oil-rich land. DiCaprio and De Niro have lost almost all expressiveness at this point in this kind of story, both of them frowny-face masks riveted in place, with all the other white people, bastards with their hands out, looking like variations on the Pep Boys. Scorsese compares them to wolves, the same way the Chinese communists in Kundun were visually equated with vultures pecking at the bones of the dead. The Osage are lost here, literally “vanishing Americans,” a racist concept hammered home by De Niro’s villain. In the film’s criminal scheme, the performances of the Native actors are swamped by the white country and Americana musicians Scorsese has cast in small roles as various murderers, thieves, and creeps. William Belleau, by contrast, is tragic and difficult to watch as the hapless Henry Roan, the melancholic, suicidal, alcoholic Osage who is befriended and discarded, shot in the head and left in the road. For the first time in a Scorsese film, however, a woman is at the center of the men’s relationship. Lily Gladstone’s Mollie, a wealthy, diabetic (she’s “got too much sugar”), and unmarried Osage comes between Dicaprio’s Ernest and De Niro’s Hale after Hale subtly sets it up for Ernest to marry her. Gladstone’s performance is unlike anything else in Scorsese’s work. She’s calm and smart, but taken in by Ernest even though she knows he’s a kind of wolf, too—“coyote wants money.” In the second half of the film, Gladstone must portray her as the martyr of the film’s sickening, deglamorized violence. She lingers between life and death, unaware she’s being poisoned by her husband as she grieves for her mother and sisters, dying one by one. Ernest starts the film as a taxi driver, reminding us of Scorsese the modernist auteur of the 1970s, who here reasserts himself outside of this naturalistic movie in its coda, where the lie of entertainment mirrors the contemporary scenes of the cleaners in The Zone of Interest. In Europe there are museums for these horrors, their history expressed in piles of shoes and eyeglasses. In America it’s called showbiz. “Yeah, well, fuck that. I’m gonna swim from Cuba to Florida” is probably the least relatable statement I’ve ever heard in a movie. Annette Bening, in the title role as Diana Nyad, however, convinces us that it’s worth doing, no matter how many times she has to try. As Diana’s ex-lover, best friend, and coach (Jodie Foster) says, “When she starts hallucinating, you go with it.” Nyad is a tribute to Diana’s self-centered delusion, which the film eventually locates in her father’s obsession with her destiny as a swimmer because he’d changed their last name to the goddess-like but fishy Nyad, and in the years of sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of a coach while she was a teenage Olympic swimmer in training. In the ocean she mentally escapes her past, using boomer pop hits like “The Sound of Silence” to measure her pace during these self-imposed, saltwater marathons. The film should come alive to these songs but it never quite does. A scene of a near shark attack is immediately followed by Diana just getting on with it, to the tune of Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold”—she is crossing the ocean for one, you see. Nyad was directed by the sports doc couple who made Free Solo, and follows its story closely and faithfully, never rising much above sea level. Its one hallucinatory underwater scene looks too much like it’s set at a fish-bowl castle. I couldn’t tell if that was intentional or not. Bradley Cooper’s ambitious Leonard Bernstein biopic starts out lively, presenting the world of midcentury classical music and life in the Carnegie Hall apartments as a fast-paced, same-sex romp, with Aaron Copland shouting advice from off-screen. It’s in black-and-white, too, the same way the similar 1950s milieu of New York theater is presented in Asteroid City. Soon, though, it’s in color and bisexual Lenny gets bogged down by a wife (Carey Mulligan) and a country house with a swimming pool, where, during the parties they throw, they also throw around adjectives like “big-ass” and “random” and phrases like “misread the room,” which I’m certain no one was using in the Dakota or in Connecticut in the 1970s. Mulligan’s Felicia has to put up with a lot in Bernstein. She knows what he’s like and what he needs to be happy and to do his work, and she gives up her career as an actress for him and their children, ignoring his male lovers as best she can while sliding inexorably into the lonely role of long-suffering wife. Bernstein exists parallel to her, and Cooper’s performance is daring and convincing, but something doesn’t add up. Since the film skips the 1960s, by the time we get to Felicia’s cancer, Lenny and she have aged and now look like Evel Knievel and Nancy Reagan miscast in an unhappy marriage, a change-in-mood time leap commandeered from Boogie Nights and now standard in biopics that include cocaine. Gone are the late 1950s and all of the 1960s, when Bernstein went radical chic and was doing TV shows with Miles Davis and donating money to the Black Panthers at cocktail parties in his huge apartment with Otto Preminger and Richard Avedon by his side. That’s a loss. If you have a chance to have somebody play Preminger in a movie, take it. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is closeted/not closeted, too, but his non-secret is left-wing politics and his parties are with the CPUSA. Around sexy fellow travelers he can’t help mentioning he’s read all three volumes of Capital, in German, making sure to add that Marx bored him. This tension also splits Oppenheimer into black-and-white and color. The color sections of Nolan’s film concentrate on quantum physics and show the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, the frenzy of the Trinity Test and its aftermath; the black-and-white parts follow the confirmation hearings of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission and Oppenheimer’s stealth nemesis, who is up for a seat in Eisenhower’s cabinet. Politics is for gray men; science is chromatic. Murphy inhabits Oppenheimer so completely that at times he disappears into the background of his own biopic, making it easy to understand why his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), continually implores him to fight politicos redbaiting him. Downey, freed from his iron suit and the MCU, is plunged into a hidden universe of waves and particles, where Oppenheimer casually dismisses him because he knows Strauss is in over his head. He doesn’t realize he’s paranoid, too. Downey’s performance is one of subtlety and guile, right up to the last twist. I have never seen an actor so thoroughly redeemed by taking a hard, thankless role like this. The film is cast like a Preminger movie, specifically like Advise & Consent, which it resembles in key ways: the backroom politics and endless meetings with the branches of the federal government and the panoply of stars in minor roles. Advise & Consent had Burgess Meredith and Betty White, this has Benny Safdie and Casey Affleck. Nolan often cuts their dialog within an inch of its life, making his scenes less dynamic so that their words can emphasize how high the stakes are (ending World War II; nuclear holocaust). He does make room for the romance of radiation within the drama of security clearance. When Oppenheimer meets Kitty, we’ve already seen the firework bursts of color that play in his head when he’s contemplating the motion of atoms in space, so there is an erotic charge when he explains physics to Kitty at a nighttime commie shindig in Pasadena. He looks almost into her eyes, touches hands with her, and describes the subatomic action in “this glass, this drink, this countertop, our bodies.” Later he’s part of a government group enumerating potential deaths when the A-bomb is dropped on Hiroshima, a corporate meeting that echoes similar conclaves in The Zone of Interest. These scenes of groups of men tallying mortality are an obscene cloud hovering over 2023 movies. The political activist Bayard Rustin, a contemporary of Oppenheimer and Leonard Bernstein who organized the March on Washington in 1963, was both gay and an ex-communist, so the struggles in his biopic are not going to be easy ones. Colman Domingo’s portrayal of him in George C. Wolfe’s Rustin is warm and involving, and this is a somber drama about a consequential time in our nation’s history. Yet the film’s perfunctory elements are enlivened by kitsch. Rustin mixing cocktails in his bachelor pad and playing the lute for his boyfriend was more than I expected. The film, like Oppenheimer, offers a who’s-who of its specific milieu, the Civil Rights Movement and its leaders. It’s odd that Jeffrey Wright is so much stronger in Rustin than he is in American Fiction. Here he plays Adam Clayton Powell Jr. as a self-important raconteur with a cigarette holder, a man who doesn’t know he’s past his prime as a macher in national politics and race relations. The British guy who plays Martin Luther King Jr. (Aml Ameen), on the other hand, can’t stand up to Domingo at all, or even to Chris Rock’s Roy Wilkins. I’m convinced that hiring Brits to play MLK is a continuing conspiracy to undermine his message. Somehow the FBI has taken control of the casting. The Branford Marsalis jazz score in Rustin is as tasteful as expected, the film less so. Rustin yelling “Cheese spoils! You should’ve known better!” at the movie’s moment of truth came out of nowhere, like one of those loud, low blats Lester Young used to drop into solos. Wes Anderson released five movies in 2023. Four of them are his Roald Dahl adaptations, shorts, the longest of which is The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar, at thirty-nine minutes. The others—Poison, The Swan, and The Rat Catcher—run seventeen minutes each. His feature film, Asteroid City, is a fleet 105 minutes, with no waste. That’s 195 minutes of cinema, about the same length as Killers of the Flower Moon or Oppenheimer. Bifurcated between black-and-white and color sequences, Asteroid City has a lot in common with Oppenheimer and Maestro. Its plot is clear enough, though it seemed to confuse some people, who somehow also found it thin. The film in color is a 1950s teleplay, the writing and production of which we see in black-and-white. In the play, a group of scientific whiz kids and their parents have gathered for an astronomy convention in a tiny town in the Southwest that’s located near a nuclear test site. The kids are to be presented by a government agency with achievement awards for their various inventions. During the ceremony, an alien visits to retrieve an asteroid that fell thousands of years ago. Meanwhile, two of the parents—one a famous movie actress (Scarlett Johansson), the other a roving photojournalist (Jason Schwartzman), both actors in the play—briefly fall in love before going their separate ways. Because of the sets, which were built on location, the film has an abstract quality. It draws on a rich history of midcentury drama and science, moves swiftly, nothing lingered on, it isn’t a biopic, and it makes no concessions to emotionality. In Asteroid City and these Dahl shorts, through elaborate but simple on-screen stagecraft, Anderson presents an ever-changing world of plastic beauty that he creates from the ground up. The screenplays are hyper-literate. In an unprecedented total avoidance of cheese in commercial narrative filmmaking, the act of writing and the writers doing it appear in these movies, but Anderson refrains from showing their writing on the screen in superimposition. Just by being cinema Anderson’s work now seems to some viewers avant-garde and difficult, yet also something obvious they can parody on social media—another sign of the regression of the movies into content. In Asteroid City, Rupert Friend has a minor role as a singing cowboy in the teleplay who’s later revealed to be a British actor as, of course, is Friend. That’s another unprecedented thing, to reveal the Brit under the cowboy. Friend narrates and stars in The Swan in full British mode, as an adult version of the boy in the story who is set upon my two unseen, gun-toting bullies, whom he also brings to life just through they way he delivers their dialogue. Friend’s also in The Rat Catcher as an auto mechanic with a shop next to a newspaper office. There was something so marvelous in seeing this actor in four roles, each of which he nailed, in these excellent films that did not get the recognition they deserved. J. A. Bayona’s Society of the Snow is this year’s All Quiet on the Western Front, a mishandled European remake of an American film based on a grueling historical event and a best-selling book. Bayona has become a worse director since he made The Impossible in 2012, also a disaster movie but much more cinematic and enjoyable in the way it seemed to punish a tourist family for going on vacation in Thailand right before a tsunami. As CGI has become dominant, Bayona’s work has suffered along with the cinema in general. Because of that we have to suffer, too. The one fact everyone knows about the Alive disaster is that the Uruguayan rugby players who were trapped in the snow in the Andes after their plane crashed had to resort to cannibalism to survive. Netflix is touting Society of the Snow as a “much-needed celebration of the human spirit” and downplaying the cannibalism, which is now known as “survival anthropophagy,” which doesn’t sound much nicer and is still the movie’s selling point. It is inhuman to deny that. Bayona ends the movie imitating Terrence Malick, because the boys had a religious experience, which is what having very little to eat in freezing temperatures for seventy-two straight days will do to you. I have known about the Alive disaster almost my whole life. One summer afternoon when I was about 7, on a rainy day when I had to stay in, I was sitting in the living room with my grandmother in Alton Bay, New Hampshire, watching an afternoon talk show on TV. The survivors of the crash were the guests. I had never heard of cannibalism. It was a completely new concept to me, and at first I couldn’t understand what these young men meant as they were discussing their plight with the host. When I began to get what had happened, I was horrified. I couldn’t believe it. These guys had eaten human flesh? I turned to my grandmother and quietly asked her, “Grammy, if we were in a plane crash together and I died, would you eat my skin?” She answered without taking her eyes off the TV screen. “Sometimes in very bad situations,” she said, “we have to do things we wouldn’t do under other circumstances,” ending our conversation right there. Natalie Portman plays an actress in Todd Haynes’s May December, an alarming film with a poisonous view of drama. An equally brilliant companion piece to Haynes’s Safe, from 1995, which also starred Julianne Moore, May December identifies and measures the new surfaces of banality that have emerged in our lives in the intervening twenty-eight years. Moore is Gracie, a suburban housewife in Georgia in her fifties. Twenty-three years previously she’d had an affair with a 13-year-old seventh grader, Joe (Charles Melton), got arrested for it, became a tabloid media sensation, gave birth to Joe’s son in prison, then married him when she got out. The story is in some ways similar to Gus Van Sant’s To Die For, which came out the same year as Safe, and which was rooted in the Pamela Smart case the way May December comes out of the Mary Kay Letourneau story. The present in May December is a goody-goody era in which sex crime and psychological complication have been swept under the rug. Portman arrives in Gracie and Joe’s life in the form of legitimate fame—she’s the star of a hit network-TV series called Norah’s Ark who will play Grace in an indie movie—but she’s also a duplicitous force who will rob them of their story and plunder Gracie’s odd persona (odder than in the Bergman film) along with her slight lisp. The best acted film of the year, it compares people to all sorts of animals, including snakes and coyotes as in Killers of the Flower Moon, settling on butterflies and golden retrievers. These are associated with Joe, a nice-guy father of three, now in his thirties but stunted and kept babyish by Gracie, who makes him the provider and caretaker of her frilly, conventional life. In showing Portman’s Elizabeth concentrating on “the work,” Haynes slowly reveals her as a self-centered Hollywood monster starting to understand that she’s in the presence of a bigger monster. The film associates Moore’s Gracie with pineapple upside-down cakes the way Poor Things associated Emma Stone’s Bella with Portuguese custard tarts—pastries of excess and derangement. In my late teens I was obsessed with Wim Wenders, and I was fortunate because I got to see almost all the features and shorts he made between 1968 and 1982 before I saw Paris, Texas and Wings of Desire and began to doubt him. There were a lot of Wenders film series and revivals going on then, it seemed like The American Friend was always playing somewhere, and for a brief time in the early 1980s, Wenders was revered by young cinephiles more than Godard. In retrospect it is easy to see why. A cinephile director himself, dedicated to Nicholas Ray, Wenders made films of ennui and longing set in desolate landscapes in Germany and America that showed us what we saw through the windshields of our cars. His movies went directly to the heart of the kind of men who are in them: romantic, post-punk loners who can’t express their feelings verbally and like the Kinks. In American films, I mean. And in reality. These Japanese families are so strong to me, even though I have nothing to do with them: I have nothing to do with the way they eat, or with the way they sleep, or with the way they get drunk all the time. It has nothing to do with me; and I feel so close to them that, if I had to choose, I’d rather sleep on the floor, and sit my whole life on the floor, and get drunk every day, and live in an Ozu family, than pass a single day as the son of Henry Fonda. By obliquely referring to Peter Fonda, Wenders is slagging Easy Rider and the New Hollywood generation who loved John Ford movies as much as he did, and offering a differentiator. He knows about something they don’t, and he is willing to be abject about it. All this seemed odd coming from a man who often dressed like he was auditioning for the lynch mob in Johnny Guitar, and it confused me, though it got me to watch Ozu films. I owe Wenders that. I have a feeling Wenders has not slept on the floor very much since that interview almost fifty years ago. I saw some photographs of Wenders from the Perfect Days shoot in which he is dressed in the same Tokyo Toilet cleaning uniform Hirayama (Kôji Yakusho) wears in the movie. He’s still abjecting himself. Now he’s made a movie about it. The meek Hirayama lives in a tiny apartment, sleeps on the floor, and listens to classic-rock cassette tapes in his van, which is outfitted for toilet cleaning the way the van in Kings of the Road was outfitted for fixing 35mm movie projectors. If it is raining out, Hirayama listens to a song that mentions rain (“Hey where did we go,/Days when the rains came?”); if the sun is coming up, he listens to a sunrise song (“There is a house in New Orleans/They call it the Rising Sun”). This is too on-the-nose, but like I said, simple. Here, Wenders gives us a kind of pleasant neorealism about a man who has withdrawn from life but who literally has his shit together. I thought the film was going somewhere deep into tragic territory, but no, it turns out the quiet Hirayama has a rich father. Hirayama lives the way he lives because he has rejected his family’s values—he’s proving he’s not Henry Fonda’s son. A rock song that’s not in the movie explains it: he wants to live like common people. Refugees from Africa who brave the Mediterranean to get to Europe are not doing it for personal glory like Diana Nyad. Matteo Garrone’s Io Capitano, however, suggests that in some cases they are. Seydou and Moussa (Seydou Starr and Moustapha Fall) are 16-year-old cousins in Dakar who spend their free time making up songs to perform for their neighborhood pals. Though they are fatherless and dominated by their mothers and sisters, their lives are full, with school and part-time jobs in construction. Still, they dream of going to Italy to be music stars. “White people will be asking you for autographs,” Moussa tells Seydou. As in Garrone’s remarkable, incisive movie Reality, about a man desperate to get on an unscripted television show (Grande Fratello) in his home country, Seydou and Moussa have to learn the hard way. An electronics repairman in the market (Oumar Diaw) tells them Europe is cold and crime-ridden, filled with homeless people. “You think Europe is better than Africa?” he asks them. “What you see on TV is not real.” They leave anyway, crossing the Sahara to get to Tripoli and a boat to Naples. Right away they are plunged into a precarious, dangerous world of human trafficking, violent militias, starvation, torture, and slave labor. Their journey, presented by Garrone as mythic, lyrical, and terrifying, ends with Seydou forced by Libyan gangsters to pilot the boat across the sea. Responsible for the lives of the other refugees onboard, Seydou rises to the occasion, because when you’re 16 you can do anything. Paolo Carnera’s virtuosic, unhackneyed cinematography is the co-star here. Io Capitano is an exquisitely shot film, with the warm colors of Senegal competing against the shifting tones of the desert and the rust of the boat at sea. I’m not sure if this is the most accurate version of the situation it’s presenting, but it has got to be the most beautiful. More a report on the human condition than on the banality of evil, Jonathan Glazer’s film of Nazi life next door to Auschwitz is also a Christmas card from a family of blonds in matching sweaters telling you what they’ve been doing all year. Seen as an exploitation film by people who have never seen an exploitation film, The Zone of Interest presents a series of distanced, precise tableaux, with father (Christian Friedel) going over the architectural plans of a crematorium at home in his stocking feet while mother (Sandra Hüller) tries on a fur coat upstairs and finds a used lipstick in its pocket, or tests desserts with the household staff. Do flowers scream? The off-screen space of sound in The Zone of Interest is paralleled to the scale of invisibility of the death camp, which we never see but hear in the background as Hedwig (Hüller) prepares for a garden party or goes about other activities in her family’s domestic life. Here is a single-income family with a father the head of production at the factory next door. The insistent, harrowing chill the film produces is not relieved by the fairy-tale scenes of a girl hiding food around the perimeter of the camp so that the condemned Jewish prisoners will have something to eat while they work themselves to death. Glazer shoots those scenes in some combination of camera negative and infrared photography. In one, we hear the tale of Hansel and Gretel read over the image, the part about the witch being stuffed into the oven. The story turns into one we know. Daddy is promoted and the family will have to move out of their dream house, spoiling their happy life. This is the same plot as Vincente Minnelli’s Judy Garland musical Meet Me in St. Louis, filmed in Hollywood and released in American theaters during the exact same time frame in which The Zone of Interest takes place—1943 and 1944. In Minnelli’s film, which takes place in 1903 and 1904, the father (Leon Ames) announces that he’s taking a job in New York City and the family will have to leave their idyllic life in St. Louis. Things work out and they don’t have to, which is also where The Zone of Interest ends, before its shock cut to cleaning women wiping the glass displays in the present-day Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Realizing this film’s inadvertent connection to a nostalgic MGM musical as I watched the The Zone of Interest placed it in new, even more dire perspective. Glazer’s film is a punk provocation, like the Sex Pistols’ song “Holidays in the Sun,” with Johnny Rotten singing about “the new Belsen” and “a cheap holiday in other people’s misery” as he anticipates World War III. If this film is a work of banality, banal compared to what? n+1 is a print and digital magazine of literature, culture, and politics published three times a year. We also post new online-only work several times each week and publish books expanding on the interests of the magazine.",POSITIVE

"Feb 1, 2024"," Christopher Nolan’s sprawling biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, after a slow-moving opening to set the backstory, finally comes into its own with the countdown before the Trinity test near Los Alamos, New Mexico confirmed that an atomic bomb would work. Supposedly that site was chosen as no civilians were living in the area, yet Indigenous inhabitants did. Whether any of those were injured by the blast and fallout is never mentioned. In the title role, Cillian Murphy fits the physical, emotional and intellectual requirements of the daunting role to a T. Oscar will be taking notice. Long-suffering, former communist wife, Kitty, is in good hands due to Emily Blunt’s wide-ranging performance—especially her palatable disdain for those jealous of her husband’s fame and success. The only narrative weakness being her “constant cocktail” habit, which soon becomes tiresome. Florence Pugh gives a commendable take on the forever communist, sometime lover of the intrepid scientist who definitely moves up in his profession as head of the Manhattan Project in a small but most important role, Tom Conti fires on all cylinders as Albert Einstein (kudos to the makeup and hair department) who, naturally, provides telling advice and prediction of the future for Oppenheimer the villain of the piece (and in real life) comes in the selfish, treacherous form of Lewis Strauss—Atomic Energy Commission chairman and Eisenhower cabinet wannabe. Robert Downey Jr. digs into the role with copious venom and ambition as required. The most notable aspect of this production is Nolan’s decision to let viewers’ imaginations fill in the truly horrific results of the A-bombs landing on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are hints of that in some of the black-and-white “vague” images, then later, assurances from President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, a readily believable occupant of the White House) that he was responsible for the bombings—not Oppenheimer (dubbed father of the atomic bomb in the media). Once the “dust” settles (and the war ends) the remainder of the film delves into Oppenheimer’s appearances in a kangaroo court (setup “anonymously” by Strauss to feed his political ambitions). Sadly, importantly, those hearings are all too close to the ongoing trials and tribulations for a former president whose crimes are—like Strauss’—revenge-driven but far removed from actual facts. The timing couldn’t have been better. As always, Nolan’s non-linear storytelling (based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin), keeps the mind engaged even as the adroit cinematography from Hoyte van Hotema and superb editing, thanks to Jennifer Lame, becomes a visual feast. The artistic icing on this generous cake comes in the form of copious amounts of nervous strings and forceful brass heard in Ludwig Göransson’s most effective original score.",POSITIVE

"Jan 3, 2024"," Roger Ebert, the father of modern film criticism, loved that quote. He knew that no critic can ever be objective, and they shouldn’t try to be. Every time we watch a film, we view it through the prism of our own experiences. Critics can lean on their knowledge of film history, their understanding of the technical aspects of filmmaking, and their ardent passion for cinema to comprise an informed judgment on a movie’s merits, but that doesn’t begin to account for the most important thing: why a film sticks with you. What makes it lodge in your gut and stick there for days, months, even years afterward? It’s a thing that cannot be explained because it occurs in that meeting place between an artist—or the team of artists and craftspeople who make a film—and the individual viewer. When you get right down to it, the only difference between a very good film and a great one is how much each of us personally connects to its ideas and how they’re expressed. For this critic, 2023 was a hard year. I’ll spare you the full details, but it involved the loss of several beloved family pets, the deterioration of one of my most important personal relationships, and a lot of therapy. There was both grief and loss. I withdrew a bit from the world. At some point, I stopped reading the news; at another point, I finished a book on baseball cinema that will be published next year. I leaned in to my passions and away from that which I had no control over. I ceased reviewing new releases and took on the repertory cinema beat here at City Paper. Revisiting the films of the past has been enlightening, but it has also left me feeling a little out of touch. As a critic, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, as groupthink is poisonous to honest discourse. I have found myself out of step with my colleagues on some of the most celebrated films of the year including Oppenheimer (I liked it, but thought the third act nearly cratered the whole thing), Barbie, and Killers of the Flower Moon. Instead, I found myself drawn to smaller independent films that portrayed and probed the simple pleasures of life: art, food, desire, family, love, and friendship. Films like Are You There, God? It’s Me, Margaret. (#5), the warm adaptation of the beloved Judy Blume novel about a Jewish teenager growing up in suburban New Jersey in the ’70s. It’s a film that finds universality in specificity, and not just its perfect replication of ’70s-era fashion, furniture, and cars. It captures the low-stakes anguish of puberty with startling insight. I don’t know what it’s like to buy tampons or worry about being the last person in your friend group to get their period … but I do know what it’s like to buy condoms before you need them and fret that you’re going to be the oldest virgin on the planet. Written and directed by Kelly Fremon Craig, the film feels like a callback to the era of John Hughes—when we laughed at teenagers so we didn’t cry for ourselves. One of the great achievements of Are You There God? is in how it expands the role of the mother, played winningly by Rachel McAdams. She has little to do in the book, but the film delves honestly into her ambivalence over being a homemaker and her complicated relationship with her parents. The compassion the film extends her reminds me of All of Us Strangers (#4), a haunting romance about a lonely urbanite (Andrew Scott) who, after striking up a romance with a sexy neighbor (Paul Mescal), finds himself drawn back to his hometown, where his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy), who died in a car crash when he was a child, are miraculously still alive and unaged. The romance is steamy enough—Scott and Mescal forge a chemistry that is both emotionally vulnerable and unbearably sexy—but Scott achieves a remarkable transformation in the scenes at home, when he reveals his sexual identity to his parents. It’s somewhere between a wish and a dream, with Scott becoming the 11-year-old boy he once was without the aid of makeup or visual effects. You don’t need big budgets or movie stars to create dramatic tension. Just look to Palm Trees and Power Lines (#6) and The Teachers’ Lounge (#7). Palm Trees was dropped on Hulu earlier this year after a festival run in 2022. Nobody seemed to notice it, or maybe the subject matter scared them off. It’s about 17-year-old Lea (Lily McInerny), who, bored and disgusted with her school friends, embarks on a romance with a 34-year-old guy (Jonathan Tucker). Discerning adults will realize the trouble from the first time they lock eyes, but first-time feature director and co-writer Jamie Dack shows incredible discipline in letting her story play out through Lea’s perspective. When you get to the horrifying climax, it’s both unthinkable and inevitable. Given the subject matter and the creative tightrope in pulling it off, it’s courageous work from all involved. The Teachers’ Lounge plays out more like a traditional thriller, though without the explicit threat of violence. The German film by İlker Çatak concerns a new teacher at a public school dealing with an epidemic of theft. Her attempt to catch the thief seems to bring a quick resolution, but nothing is simple in our world as it pertains to children, safety, and criminality. Leonie Benesch is revelatory as the idealistic teacher trying to do the right thing at every turn and somehow getting herself in deeper with her students, their parents, and eventually her colleagues. Is it possible to do the right thing in our world? Is it even worth it? The Teachers’ Lounge asks those questions and smartly doesn’t try to answer them.  Maybe we should “just keep telling the story.” That’s the advice the playwright gives  the actor in Asteroid City (#9), Wes Anderson’s exploration of terrestrial and extraterrestrial life. Set at a Junior Stargazing convention in a small desert town, Anderson bounces his cast of troubled adults and observant children against each other, while building in a nesting doll narrative structure, and painting some of the richest, most pleasing hues of his career. As I pondered the loss of my beloved dogs this year, did I relate to Jason Schwartzman’s grieving widower? Did I spend a few nights gazing at the stars and pondering my place in the universe? Did I worry about how to tell the children—my remaining dogs—the news? Yes, I did. But I also warmly recalled Anderson’s blue desert sky once or twice, amid months of thinking about how we use art to both heal and relive our traumas.  Or we could just rely on each other. That’s how the central trio in The Holdovers (#8) gets through a mercilessly cold two weeks at a New England boarding school. It’s Christmas vacation, and they have nowhere else to go. Angus (newcomer Dominic Sessa) has been abandoned by his mother and new stepdad; Mr. Hunham (Paul Giamatti) has drawn the short straw and been tasked with supervising Angus; and cafeteria manager Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, in a performance that’s already winning awards) has to stick around and make sure the men don’t die of starvation. Each character is prickly in their own way, but they quickly warm to one another. Their time (and ours) is spent trying to help each other heal, making The Holdovers the warmest film of director Alexander Payne’s career, if not one of his best. Certainly the one I needed at the end of this year. There’s also a warmth in Showing Up (#10) and Afire (#3), although it doesn’t seem like it at first. Kelly Reichardt’s Showing Up opens on a frustrated sculptor (Michelle Williams) rushing an injured pigeon out of her window so it can die in the street. Afire concerns itself with a miserable writer (Thomas Schubert) whose vacation with his best friend is nearly ruined by his own defensiveness. Neither character is particularly sympathetic at the outset. The only reason they earn our compassion is from how caringly they are portrayed by the filmmaker (Christian Petzold) and actors. Over the course of these films, we get to know and love these fictional artists not because they’re flawless people but because, simply, they are people, with all their flaws and complexities. Williams and Schubert play characters who would be fast friends if they ever met—their insecurities would join them at the hip—but they have to scrape and claw for every little bit of peace in the world. In watching them find it, we might find a little peace for ourselves. I had the same wish for the anonymous protagonist of David Fincher’s The Killer (#2), and I might have been the only one. Many otherwise intelligent people found this to be a cold and calculating genre exercise. I thought it was one of the warmest and funniest films of the year. The film opens with our anonymous protagonist (Michael Fassbender) preparing for a job, demonstrating and explaining to us in a hilarious voice-over the discipline that it takes to perform his task well. He shares personal mantras—“Forbid empathy”; “Fight only the battle you’re paid to fight”—that seem to have been taken from a 21st-century dude-bro self-help book.  He makes clear that these rules are the very foundation of his life—then he proceeds to break every one of them. The Killer is certain he is one thing but shows us with his every decision that he’s actually another. It makes him a fool, a tragic hero, and an avatar for every adult living on this planet. If you accept the framework of The Killer’s life—that he commits murder for a living—you can see him striving toward connection and compassion within it. It’s there in the way he murders a cab driver quickly and without warning, sparing him from, as another character later puts it, the worst nightmare of being aware of your impending death (wait, isn’t that all of us?). It’s there in his aliases, all of which represent characters from ’70s and ’80s sitcoms. It’s like he’s waiting for some bank teller or rental car associate to recognize the name Sam Malone and share a laugh with him, but they never do. Hardly a genre exercise, The Killer is a self-referential work in which Fincher acknowledges his own reputation as a controlling director and digs under the surface to find the quivering child beneath. He’s there, but you have to look for him. Speaking of quivering, my favorite film of the year is The Taste of Things (#1), the most tender film of 2023. I regret that it won’t hit most theaters until Feb. 14, but I can’t imagine a more perfect release date than Valentine’s Day. The French romance chronicles the relationship between Dodin (Benoît Magimel), a 19th-century landowner, and his cook and sometimes lover, Eugenie (Juliette Binoche). It opens on a 20-minute scene of the duo preparing an extravagant meal for Dodin and his friends, and while it’s one of the most sensual experiences ever put on film—you can hear every knife cutting through flesh and smell every simmering roux—it never tips over into what we would today call food porn. It’s not a film for people who use pleasure to escape life. It’s for those who believe food is art, and art is life. So is love. Dodin and Eugenie share a bed every now and then. He wants them to marry. She simply wants to be his cook and lover. Is this simply the most French film ever made, endorsing food as religion and a relationship between a boss and his woman employee as not only acceptable, but ideal? Sure, that’s one way to see it. I’d say it bathes you in ephemerality, arguing in its gentle, naturalistic aesthetic that you can savor life without trying to hold onto it. In the end, life will prove it to you, anyway. Enjoy yourself while you’re here. Get to know yourself and others. Know who the man is watching that movie, for the more you know yourself, the more you can know the world. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024"," Oppenheimer, inspired by the book American Prometheus, which Robert Pattinson gifted to director Nolan, recounts J. Robert Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) life, beginning with his school years, moving through the dropping of the atom bomb, and ending with his security hearing. Even as a young adult, physics and the inner workings of the world fascinate, so much so that he’s distracted from life in front of him, other sciences, socialization, and relationships.  While in school, he meets Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) who is already familiar with his work. This leads to a meeting with Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), and eventual recruitment by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) for Harvard. Upon accepting the job, and with few students signing up for his classes, he befriends Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and is eventually recruited again, only this time by the government.  General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) wants Oppenheimer to catch America up in the arms race. This leads to the development, thanks to ingenuity, of The Manhattan Project. The science doesn’t quite exist and much of what they’re doing is an experiment, but amid Communism scares, WWII, and scandal, the project leaders and scientists make the deadline for the test. Few of them are prepared for the quickness with which the American government takes the project away. Oppenheimer is stunned and tortured because of the devastation and guilt, but President Truman (Gary Oldman) takes the blame.  The president does not take Oppenheimer’s advice that the country re-examine America’s use of the bomb though. It’s too late. J. Robert Oppenehimer’s late life leads to a review of his security clearance which is almost concurrent with one of his original supporters and recruiters, Senator Strauss, seeking to gain approval for his nomination as Secretary of Commerce. The beauty of that summary doesn’t lie in the fact that the summary is historical and obviously pushes back against spoilers. The beauty is how that traditional timeline is stretched and deviated by Nolan in a way that only he can. Nolan is a master of adding tension where there is very little, while deflating strenuous moments and creating an environment that is almost unbearable. Oppenheimer ebbs between tension and stress, manipulating time in a way reminiscent of Dunkirk, which I often label as Nolan’s perfect work. Weeks after the release of Nolan’s latest and I’m not sure about my rankings anymore. Nolan’s fictional work is what he’s often known for but the work he’s doing by reimagining history might be what cements his career. One of the key elements of the film is sound and how it’s withheld and overdone. The audience won’t hear explosions when they expect them, yet we do experience an abundance of cacophony, including cheering, applause, and mechanization. Oppenheimer isn’t all sound either. It’s visually stunning and delicate, light when possible and dark when necessary. One of the few criticisms of the film, which continues a necessary discussion that’s never finished, is the portrayal of women and their overall absence. Women were disproportionately represented in the field of science during the time of The Manhattan Project. 3.8% of women held a college degree at the time, so their presence on location wasn’t expected, yet some audience members, myself included, couldn’t get past how Oppenheimer interacted with women, regardless of whether the interactions were realistic or not.  His friend and hidden partner Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) never meets his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), though they have one scene together; the female students, secretaries, and scientists don’t interact with one another either. The film overtly fails the adopted Bechdel test, continually noted as a joke, yet the joke still compels people to inquire if a film sidelines an entire gender. The test highlights moments audiences may casually overlook, but maybe this movie doesn’t really need to pass it anyway. Oppenheimer was deemed a womanizer in the movie and the lack of female characters interacting is a reflection of that. There are two additional ideas that might undercut that claim though: in general, Nolan doesn’t typically write about female characters—there’s a debate about representation with Murphy (Jessica Chastain) and Brand (Anne Hatheway) in Interstellar—and additionally the main women in the film fall into the mistress and wife/mother category a little too easy. This may underscore Oppenheimer’s use of them in this way, but nevertheless, I did find it unfortunate to see the reduction. Maybe this comes back to the idea and claim long before the film’s debut that we don’t need more stories about powerful, small, white men, even though the interpretation of their stature by the end is remarkable. What impresses me most about Oppenheimer is Nolan’s trajectory. Many fans began following his career after his work on Batman, moving backwards to catch some of his more grounded work like Memento. Though I personally haven’t seen The Following yet, I appreciate that, similar to a poet, Nolan is often telling the same story repeatedly just with refined techniques. He’s always curious about humanity and what makes a person human. It’s the through-line on all of his work, whether we’re watching Bruce Wayne recover from trauma by giving up his humanity or soldiers on the shore of Dunkirk mustering the last ounces.  Nolan is one of the few directors whose themes barely change while the outward dressing is always shifting.  The techniques are similar as well, but he harnesses them more and more over time. Everyone entered Oppenheimer curious how Nolan would create a bomb with practical effects, no CGI, and minimal VFX work. He is a master and only the best can do what he does, the withholding of what audiences want or expect, the delayed gratification, and reassembly later on in a schema we weren’t expecting. Developing the atom bomb was a heinous act. It’s one of hundreds of low moments for mankind. But what I appreciate about everyone involved is that the film refuses to create winners. Every character is so small by the close of the 3-hour film. Whether they admit it or not, they are changed. J. Robert Oppenheimer is the smallest of anyone by film’s end. Still a man, scientist, and great mind, but lesser, and Nolan makes that undeniable. It’s been several weeks and I’d still rank this a 5 out of 5. If you were intimidated by Barbenheimer or the sold-out, 24/7 IMAX seats, make sure to catch this before it leaves theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024"," Oppenheimer is not a joy to behold. But it is a fascinating motion picture everyone should see…and absorb. It is also likely to be heralded at the Oscars as Best Picture.  As a Boomer, the film personally connects. Being a high school varsity debater in 1965, I verbally sparred about the threat of nuclear war with Russia. “Peaceful Coexistence” was an oft used term—coming from teens who had “ducked and covered” in classroom drills during the 1950s. It was all about the threat of the atomic bomb, which by the mid ‘60s had escalated to the hydrogen bomb. Twenty years earlier, in 1945, WWII ended with our atom bombs devastating Japan.  The story structure begins during Oppenheimer’s 1926 university year and stays its course through nuclear discoveries in the late 1930s to WWII developments (both military and scientific) and then to postwar years with Presidents Truman through Johnson.  Oppenheimer’s (Murphy) love life is included, focusing on dating Jean Tatlock (Pugh), a Communist Party member. This was the beginning of the upending of Oppenheimer’s controversial political leanings. Not only does he have friends who are Communist Party members, but ends up marrying Katherine “Kitty” (played by Blunt), an ex-member. It is no surprise that the brilliant scientist becomes the focus of House Un-American Activities accusations. His personal life becomes fodder for political retribution, despite the fact his Quantum Physics expertise led to the development and eventual dropping of the atom bomb on Japan that ended WWII.  A major player in the movie is Robert Downey Jr., who does a fine job as Oppenheimer’s nemesis, Lewis Strauss. The Atomic Energy Commission’s Chairman, Strauss, held a long time resentment of Oppenheimer, and used his testimony to strip Oppenheimer of security clearance. Thus, Oppenheimer was blocked from anything to do with nuclear research. This sequence occurs in the third hour of the film. Before that happens, we witness Oppenheimer in full power as he heads a team in Los Alamos, New Mexico to develop a nuclear bomb to end the war.  It is fascinating to witness the re-creation of that town built to house the scientists and technicians (and their families) while work proceeds. It all had to do with privacy and expediency. And it worked. Interestingly, the film’s structure is laced with flashback sequences necessary for context references. Also, much of the story is narrated by Strauss/Downey Jr. To minimize any confusion regarding the story’s point-of-view, director Nolan chose to film Oppenheimer’s sequences in color. Strauss’s stances are shown in black and white. The result is subtle and clarifying. It truly helps in a movie as complex as Oppenheimer certainly is.  Oppenheimer is packed with outstanding performances, particularly by the mostly unknown Cillian Murphy. He not only greatly resembles the brooding main character, but is totally believable.  There were things about the famous during those years I found fascinating. Take Albert Einstein, as portrayed by Tom Conti. And I am still jarred by the persona of President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman). I will not detail the latter here, but I had to research it after seeing the film to verify he did indeed say such to and about Dr. Oppenheimer. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2024"," Following The Film Stage’s collective top 50 films of 2023, as part of our year-end coverage, our contributors are sharing their personal top 10 lists. After 2022 left me feeling a bit out in weeds in regards to film culture (both the state of movies in general, and especially the ones that got people the most amped up that kept leaving me disappointed), I came into 2023 a pessimist and left with a rejuvenated belief that the movies are, indeed, back. This year was overflowing with riches, to the point where even up until this very moment I’m mentally swapping in and out some titles for the list you’re about to see of my annual favorites. There’s just too many gems I don’t want to leave behind, and they came in all shapes and sizes. From some of my favorite directors making highly anticipated returns (including one for their final feature) to filmmakers I’ve always been cold on for the first time making something that has nestled its way into my heart and promises to remain there for eternity. The even bigger surprise is that, while not all of my personal selections are in the mix for major awards attention, it’s actually looking pretty solid that a large portion of them will. Somehow the sky has opened up, and things look bright again.  That makes my list feel perhaps a little pedestrian—certainly more than last year, in which not a single one of my top ten selections earned an Academy Award nomination—but I’ve definitely got some more esoteric choices thrown into the mix as well.  To see my full ranking of 2023 releases, you can check out my list on Letterboxd. There, you’ll also find my ranked list of all the non-2023 titles that I saw for the first time this year. That selection is highlighted by Between the Lines, The Bridges of Madison County, Choose Me, T.R. Baskin, Victims of Sin and Rolling Thunder.  A tender little romance between two people isolated from much of society, cast down and out as they make their way through the days until by chance they find a connection with one another, Fallen Leaves rides the wave between gentle transcendence and inimitable cool. Our Finnish comp to Jim Jarmusch, Aki Kaurismäki is in top form with another feature that gives you the urge to smoke a cigarette and hit the town at night. Through the romance, Fallen Leaves takes on some larger themes, tackling notions of masculinity and the many layers of what it actually means to be a man—which isn’t hiding from your problems in isolation or in the bottle. It’s also disarmingly funny at times, with Kaurismäki’s dry as sandpaper wit really shining in moments that had me in stitches—probably one of the most hilarious movies of the year.  If The Burial had come out 15 years ago, I probably would have given it a C+ and called it unremarkable. In 2023, it feels like a revelation. A ’90s throwback courtroom drama with two A-listers and a strong supporting cast. A mixture of character introspection, rich macro themes, legal investigation, and a David vs Goliath battle. An honestly surprising amount of genuinely effective comedic bits. Margaret Betts navigates the more interesting-than-you’d-expect tone of this so well, aided by a stellar Jamie Foxx performance at the head, perfectly instilling a showboating ambulance-chasing huckster persona with deep-rooted insecurities that start to crack and a desire to do something greater. Tommy Lee Jones dials back the curmudgeon vibes for a really sincere performance of a belittled everyman who wants to see these exploitative vampires pay. They’re an odd pairing who work really well together, and you get invested in seeing their parallel journey for the cause. The Burial is an unbelievably charming slice of comfort food, the type of movie we took for granted when it was all the rage and now doesn’t exist anymore. Inspired by the likes of Visconti’s The Innocent, Akerman’s Je, Tu, Il, Elle and Ripploh’s Taxi zum Klo, Ira Sachs delivers the best film of his career with the steamy tale of Tomas (Franz Rogowski, continuing to make the argument that he’s our finest actor), the dictionary definition of a chaotic bisexual. As Tomas tears through lovers old (Ben Whishaw’s Martin, his husband) and new (Adèle Exarchopoulos’s Agathe, the woman he cheats with), we wonder just what kind of wreckage he’ll unleash upon those in his orbit next. There’s an intoxicating roller coaster of emotions that Passages takes us on, the sort of train wreck we can’t look away from. Tomas is infuriating, exhausting, and yet in some strange ways admirable—he’s unabashedly himself, down to his dynamic fashion choices that rank among the best costume design of the year. Also in the best of the year conversation is Josée Deshaies’ cinematography, using ingenious framing and blocking techniques to emphasize the torrential emotional interiority of the characters in every scene. White man’s greed is a volatile thing, so easily manipulated into carnage, so fragile and always on the lookout for threats. Whether it’s money, sex, or land, it all boils down to one thing: power. The power they’ve held for so long, and the power they refuse to relinquish in any capacity. The machinery of white supremacy is the center of Killers of the Flower Moon, and unlike Scorsese’s many cautionary tales depicting the folly of greedy men, there’s no fun to be had here. No invitation into the thrill of the moment. Like The Irishman, Scorsese’s latest has a funereal tone to it, but it’s not a eulogy for these men, for this way of life, for the realization that they’ve lived it all for nothing — it’s a eulogy for a country, for an entire culture of people who are being washed away by the unrelenting violence of white men. After a staggering meta moment where the director turns the lens on himself and his own place within the machine, Flower Moon crescendos with a powerful drumming, a statement that after all of this, the Osage live on. They’ll still tell their stories the way they always have, they’ll still look after each other, they’ll still beat these drums and their fight won’t surrender. The Killer feels like the Rosetta Stone for David Fincher: the core of his entire thesis as an artist. A man who exists in exactitudes, in process and efficiency, yet he’s undone by the unpredictability of human beings and the mercy of having to operate within the structures of our modern world. It is also, like Fincher himself, remarkably funny in a wry, unassuming way—whether it’s the opening 20-minute sequence of the eponymous figure telling us how he’s a calculated master of his game only to screw the pooch in the most obvious way possible, the cheeky product placement, like Michael Fassbender describing why he gets McDonald’s every day because it’s the perfect way to blend in as a cold-blooded murderer, or sight gags like the dog busting through the glass door. At the same time, it’s an incredibly engaging process movie, as we watch this man execute plans step by step, see them play out perfectly or have to watch him adapt when things go awry. It’s lean, mean, and remarkably efficient, just like the character and just like Fincher. The final feature of legendary filmmaker William Friedkin, The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial sent him out on a high. Remarkably bold in its formal and aesthetic approach, the courtroom drama is practically Bressonian in its minimalism and removal from conventional cinematic attributes. Almost the entire picture is composed of tight shots on the actors (including one final riveting performance from the late Lance Reddick), less than ten of them contained in this one setting where a series of witnesses are called to sit in a chair and be grilled by opposing lawyers. We are in this room for these two hours and that’s it. We see it all unfold, and it’s up to us to make interpretations or judgments, if we wish, as to who these people really are. It’s absolutely gripping cinema. A violent reckoning with America’s bloodlust, filtered through a man whose ego and naïveté facilitated one of the most unspeakable monstrosities in the history of the world; an unprecedented devastation that still reverberates through civilizations today. Wisely, Oppenheimer never paints the man as a victim nor as a tortured genius. He’s something else entirely. An explorer who doesn’t stop to think about what his discovery will mean. A man who tries to be neutral, who doesn’t have a stance. He believes he has morality, but there’s no conviction — or if there is, it’s overrun by his need for fame and the blinders he puts on to the real world. That’s a more damning statement than anything else: that he can destroy so much, and end up on the cover of TIME magazine as some sort of hero. Oppenheimer leaves us with the unshakable threat of nuclear holocaust hanging over us but it’s not just that. It’s any of the many ways that men in suits have destroyed our world to line their pockets, whether it’s the plenty of other genocides that have occurred, economic disparity, the annihilation of the climate, the scours of people who have died due to a preventable virus because these people left the world to rot. The latest masterpiece from Christian Petzold, one of our finest filmmakers, Afire is catnip for insecure, resentful, bitter, and judgmental writers who are decently talented but not nearly as good as they think they are or want to be. In other words, this had me eating out of the palm of its hand. Stepping away from the semi-mythic tales Petzold’s been weaving in his past three features, this is a sometimes hilarious, sometimes scathing, always gripping jaunt that’s clearly in conversation with the works of Éric Rohmer. As light on its feet as Afire is, there’s also an indictment of that very fact, as these characters find themselves so consumed by their petty foibles and narcissism while less than 50km away forest fires are wreaking havoc through communities and wildlife. They are constantly faced with how meaningless all of this actually is, and yet they can’t help themselves. None of us can. The world will always revolve around us, even when we can see the tragedy right in front of our eyes. It’s okay, it won’t hit us. It’s just over there. Until it’s not. Alexander Payne has expressed issues with people describing The Holdovers as a “cozy” film, but in doing so he’s misinterpreting what people mean by that. Cozy doesn’t mean saccharine or schmaltzy. This film is certainly not that. Beyond the inherently cozy nature of the story’s setting in time period, location and season, the coziness comes from its gentle, gradual unraveling of its characters’ layers. The coziness comes from allowing us the gift of time and space to simply exist with these three people and learn about them as they learn about each other. To grapple with their griefs, their melancholy, their anger, their disappointment, the same way that we grapple with our own. The Holdovers is a bitter movie, but it’s not a cynical one. It finds value in the small victories, even if that’s just as small as having someone sit next to you so you feel less alone when you’re completely alienated from the rest of the world. 2023 was the year of the courtroom drama (see #4 and #8, and parts of both #3 and #6), and Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or winner brought us into the specifically nutty circus of the French court system, where a woman is put to the task of defending herself against accusations of murdering her husband. A riveting investigation occurs on the stand as she’s hounded by a supremely snarky prosecutor and the media puts her under the microscope, but what’s most fascinating about Anatomy of a Fall is its slow dissection into the anatomy of the marriage itself. Each scene uncovers new layers in their relationship, exploring the ways in which we all build up resentment, ache, jealousy, and sometimes even rage over time. Were any of our spouses to perish under unusual circumstances, would we not also be the most glaring suspect?  Mitchell Beaupre is the Senior Editor at Letterboxd, and currently based out of Newark, Delaware.

"Dec 30, 2023"," 2023 was the year audiences – post-Covid – rediscovered their love of theatrical releases. Going to the movies became worthy again with embrace of the contrasting “Barbie” by Greta Gerwig and “Oppenheimer” by Christopher Nolan being released the same day, a box-office showdown that went viral as “Barbenheimer.” Both became top-grossing films, a pleasant surprise in an arena so often occupied by superheroes, reboots and sequels.  Jonathan Glazer’s rendering of the banality of evil captivates. In tight close-ups, we watch as a German family tries to create an idyll for themselves in a slice of heaven with a big lawn that spawns self-sustaining life, tended to by Hedwig, played by “Anatomy of a Fall” star Sandra Hüller. When the camera pulls out, we see billowing smoke in the near distance. It’s just one sign of the heinous ills in the hands of this family: The patriarch, played by Christian Friedel, is real-life Nazi commandant Rudolf Höss, and behind the high wall that abuts the family home is the Auschwitz concentration camp. We hear screaming and gunfire in the distant background as the family goes about its daily life. The film is an exhaustive endurance test – as it should be. There’s brutalism to Glazer’s filmmaking, the hard edges and severity of editing and sound design superb and eliciting a sense of nauseating dread. Still, Glazer takes pains to ensure we only hear the horrors, questioning the morality of making them cinematic. (Ally Johnson) Coming soon to theaters. A contemporary Manhattan family’s comfortable routine gets disrupted when writer and teacher Beth Mitchell (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and her sister, Sarah (Michaela Watkins), overhear Beth’s husband, therapist Don Mitchell (Tobias Menzies, “Game of Thrones”), confide to his brother-in-law Mark (Arian Moayed, “Succession”) that he does not like his wife’s new novel. Writer-director Nicole Holofcener reunites with Louis-Dreyfus to outdo their independent dramedy hit “Enough Said” (2013), with Holofcener per usual capturing the realistic yet casual ebb and flow between work, home and leisure and creating organic, three-dimensional characters. Louis-Dreyfus and Menzies anchor the film as a long-married, still-in-love couple who must find their way from rupture to repair. At the epicenter are well-intentioned lies that the film’s hypothesis has it are the lubricant that makes relationships work, while honesty makes each character question their grasp of reality, self-worth and professional choices. Beth’s story is the film’s drive, but Don’s world is arguably more compelling because of the exposure of his work and potpourri of patients, including real-life wife and husband Amber Tamblyn and David Cross playing a miserable married couple vocal about Don’s professional inadequacies. The film’s a provocative probe into one’s self-worth and esteem rounding midlife and trying to find truth within and within others close to them. (Sarah G. Vincent) Video on demand only. Celine Song’s debut marks a lavishly melancholic film. Childhood friends Nora (Seung Ah Moon) and Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim) are together constantly, tethered by the others’ orbital force. They lose touch when Nora emigrates with her family from South Korea but reunite as adults, now played by Greta Lee and Teo Yoo. A soulful, bone-aching story, the film serves as a reminder that life is determined by action and instinct. The script, also written by Song, showcases emotions that lie beneath the surface, capturing the idea of love being a reflection of youth. Is what we’re remembering the love of the person or the love of the feeling? These characters linger in the others’ minds, pillars of their youth and, in moments, projections of what could have been. What makes “Past Lives” such a feat of storytelling is the ability to make ordinary existences transformative. Song’s grace in the film is found through her empathic understanding of how even the briefest relationship can take up space in a person’s heart for decades. Read a full review from June 8. (Ally Johnson) On Amazon Prime Video. Director Alexander Payne (“Election,” “Nebraska”) and television series writer David Hemingson’s first collaboration – shot on location in Massachusetts and set in the 1970s – is an instant Christmas classic. Every winter break, the exclusive, fictional all-boys boarding school Barton Academy has young men who remain on campus. Curmudgeon ancient civilization teacher and alum Paul Hunham (Paul Giamatti), who has nothing but contempt for his privileged charges, supervises the “holdovers,” which includes rebellious, sullen junior Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa, in a seamless onscreen debut). Thanks to the coaching of mourning mother and kitchen supervisor Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Robinson), the only other adult staying on campus, and local faculty member Lydia Crane (Carrie Preston), Hunham transforms into Tully’s most nurturing and fiercest advocate. This heartwarming and humorous tale of misfits connecting over wounded pasts and adoring the beauty and potential in each other is a lesson in unconditional acceptance and redemption without pity or mocking. By saving Tully from the Vietnam War, Hunham gives himself a second chance of living a full life. Read a full review from Nov. 11. (Sarah G. Vincent) In theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. Only Christopher Nolan could adapt Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s “American Prometheus,” a mammoth tome about American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and have audiences gobble it up like his more traditional summer popcorn films such as “Inception” (2010), the Dark Knight trilogy and “Tenet” (2020). The titular protagonist (Cillian Murphy, who carries the film dutifully) hits his zenith as the father of the atomic bomb during World War II; during the Red Scare of the 1950s, he falls from grace because of nonpolitical ties to communists. Besides the Trinity Test in the desert, much of the action becomes backroom betrayal and kangaroo court sparring, a conventional, contrasting character study between Oppenheimer and his former boss, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), that gets told in an unconventional way, alternating between charting Oppenheimer’s career, the 1958 Senate hearings on Strauss’ nomination to secretary of commerce and the 1954 U.S. Atomic Energy Commission deliberating whether to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Nolan eschews chronological order and toggles between color/subjective perspective and black and white/documentary-style, complemented by editor Jennifer Lame and composer Ludwig Göransson, and the film never gets bogged down despite the intermission-less, three-hour runtime – a record for Nolan. Bursting at the seams with an ensemble delivering memorable performances and impressive practical effects, “Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s best film to date and the definitive historical biopic about the era. Read a full review from July 19. (Sarah G. Vincent) In theaters and on Amazon Prime Video. The most recent from indie stalwart Kelly Reichardt (“First Cow”) reunites the director with early collaborator and recent Oscar nominee (for “The Fabelmans”) Michelle Williams (who starred in Reichardt’s “Wendy and Lucy” and “Meek’s Cutoff”). The focus is again the Pacific Northwest, where many of Reichardt’s films take place, but in the near contemporary rather than the frontier era of “Cow” and “Cutoff.” The shaggy-dog narrative is as much about family and familial dysfunction as about the art scene and its passive-aggressive competitiveness. Williams plays Lizzy, a sculptor who makes Degas-like statuettes of waifish young women. She can’t catch an art opening break and her landlord, also an artist (BU alum Hong Chau, so good in “The Menu” and Oscar-nominated for her caretaker part in “The Whale”), drags her feet in getting the hot water turned back on despite Lizzy not having had a shower in days. There’s also Lizzy’s dad, an established but eccentric artist (Judd Hirsch, also opposite Williams in “Fabelmans” and also Oscar nominated for it) who’s got a bunch of random hippies hanging out at his cottage studio. It’s a dour yet quirky meander that revolves around the well-being of a wounded pigeon. (Tom Meek) On Showtime.  There’s overwhelming compassion for the characters in Kelly Fremon Craig’s (“The Edge of Seventeen”) adaptation of the Judy Blume YA classic, and Craig’s take on the 1970s-set novel captures turbulent girlhood with detail and reverence. Margaret (Abby Ryder Fortson) is 11 and going into sixth grade after having moved, reluctantly, to a new town. “Are You There God?” refreshes the genre by focusing on the minutiae of day-to-day life for preteen girls, whose naiveté has them longing to get their period, wear bras despite their discomfort and kiss boys they’re not even sure they like. Rachel McAdams as Margaret’s mother, Barbara, is luminous in a performance made for her easy charm and empathetic disposition. Shooting with compositional care for all the bits and pieces that make up these characters’ lives, Craig delivers an honest, hilarious and heartfelt film about a girl who is beginning to see the world with greater skepticism and curiosity. The result is something quietly profound, a film that understands that the world at 11 is impossibly endless. (Ally Johnson) On Starz and Amazon Prime Video. Todd Haynes’ loose adaptation of the real-life Mary Kay Letourneau case, about the Washington schoolteacher who had an affair with a 13-year old student in the 1990s and marries him after she gets out of prison, is a smorgasbord of deep character plumbs and rich performances. The film slowly and effectively backs into the premise as the fictional Mary Kay, Gracie (Julianne Moore), and her much younger husband, Joe (Charles Melton), are visited by a striking young woman by the name of Elizabeth Berry (Natalie Portman), a midlist actor renowned for a graphic nude scene or two who is down to do research for an upcoming telling of Gracie and Joe’s sordid union in a small, indie production. The character study veers as Elizabeth has coffee with Gracie’s ex-husband (D.W. Moffett) and later a music hall encounter with Gracie’s son Georgie (a sassy and beguiling Cory Michael Smith) from her first marriage. Elizabeth’s presence also stirs something in Gracie and Joe. They have a simmering inner turmoil fueled by the reliving of their ignominy and the upcoming graduation of their children that will leave the two alone – “to what future?” seems to be the lingering question. The performances by the three leads have raw reveals nailed with aplomb. Most intriguing is Portman’s actor: inviting at first, then unnerving as she begins to work the equation from both sides. It’s her most perverse and sensual performance since “Black Swan” (2010). It’s also nice to see Haynes (“Velvet Goldmine,” “I’m Not There”) back in the realm of dark quirk after the conventional “Dark Waters” and reuniting with his longtime muse, Moore, from “Safe” (1995), “Far From Heaven” (2002) and “Carol” (2015). (Tom Meek) On Netflix. Justine Triet’s film, winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes, dissects the slow, vicious implosion of a marriage. The reasons are the usual suspects: grief, blame and jealousy. But there’s little else usual about Triet’s emotionally eviscerating narrative, which begins with the death of one spouse and, in carefully curated frames, rewinds as the survivor is put on trial for murder. Sandra Hüller portrays a revered German writer living in the remote highs of the French Alps and then subjected to character dissection in the courtroom, and the performance is immersive, fully felt from within and the reason the film rivets from opening to closing frame. Between her work here and “Zone of Interest,” Hüller could see her name called twice when Oscar nominations are announced. Read a full review from Oct. 28. (Tom Meek) Not available in area theaters or yet streaming. Sakura Andō stars as a mother, Saori, who begins noticing strange behavior in her young son, Minato (Sōya Kurokawa) in the empathetic and haunting latest from Hirokazu Kore-eda (“Shoplifters,” “After the Storm”). The story is told from three points of view, including the mother, the boy’s teacher, Hori (Eita Nagayama), and the boy himself, revealing successively more about the truth behind Minato’s personal demons in a story about rebirth and the painful reality of a parent’s inability to ever truly understand their child. Written by Yûji Sakamoto, the film possesses an emotional subtlety that lies heavy against us as it progresses and we become more entangled and concerned in the lives of these characters – Minato in particular. Kurokawa’s performance is vital to the film’s success; our hearts ache for his desperate, quiet search for compassion and understanding from adults who can’t begin to understand the pressure he feels to hide himself from the world. Kore-eda’s elegance as a filmmaker is on display here, taking an observant approach to characters while capturing the overwhelming nature that surrounds them. The film brandishes acute beauty in devastation and understanding of human error, ending on a note of melancholy as we’re asked to question what constitutes a happy ending.

"Dec 29, 2023"," With the end of the year bringing ambitious new works from octogenarian masters Martin Scorsese, Michael Mann, and Ridley Scott—plus strong new entries from mid-career auteurs Yorgos Lanthimos, Jonathan Glazer, Wes Anderson, and Alexander Payne—2023, in some ways, felt like a throwback to an era to which many (male, middle-aged) cinephiles have longed to return. But Barbie and Oppenheimer, the films whose mutually beneficial fake rivalry defined the year, were both real movies from real filmmakers with real points of view, and the commercial success of both felt like Greta Gerwig and Christopher Nolan getting away with something. That, plus the fact that audiences finally rejected a pair of truly forgettable Marvel movies (honestly, the much-reviled The Flash was better than either of them), was another sign that the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel might be something other than an oncoming train. Barbenheimer’s great success came at the expense of the supposedly penultimate entry in the best, most analog action franchise going. Given the chaotic process by which writer-director Christopher McQuarrie says he and stuntman/producer/star Tom Cruise make these movies, they should be train wrecks. Instead, this one gave us the most thrilling train wreck ever captured on digital celluloid. Move over, Buster Keaton!  Ari Aster’s inscrutable odyssey about a troubled man’s quest to leave his apartment and visit his mother was the better of the year’s two Joaquin Phoenix-starring epics by a mile. It was lovely to see Parker Posey again, but yikes. Remember when Tim Burton made films you actually wanted to see? Lanthimos’ reunion with his The Favourite collaborator Emma Stone was weird and kinky and hilarious and unsettling in the way Burton’s films once were—in a previous century. Let me see if I can do this from memory, about a film I saw three times: Anderson’s lockdown-inspired latest depicts a 1950s TV broadcast of a filmed stage production of a play about a one-horse New Mexico town that gets locked down by the U.S. Army following a Close Encounter? Whatever, this movie was bliss. It was great to see Jeffrey Wright, the standout player from The French Dispatch, solidify his standing among the Wes Anderson Players, a group that Tom Hanks slid into like a comfy old sweater. And seeing Jason Schwartzman—who also appeared as the year’s best supervillain in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse—play a middle-aged widower a quarter century after embodying Max Fischer in Anderson’s seminal Rushmore only made the reflections on mortality land harder. Sure, we could’ve used even more of the magnificent Lily Gladstone as Mollie Burkhart, one of the survivors of a murderous conspiracy against newly super-rich Osage people during the 1920s. But Scorsese deserves the credit he got for hitting pause on the version of his adaptation of David Grann’s nonfiction book that he was about to shoot when a group of Osage leaders contacted him to offer their insight into the project. Rebooting the movie away from the procedural version that would’ve starred Leonardo DiCaprio as straight-arrow lawman Tom White, and choosing instead to make Burkhart the focus and DiCaprio her shit-heel husband Ernest, required Scorsese to go find his $200 million budget elsewhere. The result was a more complex and empathetic film. Glazer’s follow-up to 2013’s Under the Skin reinvented the Holocaust film by keeping all the horror off-screen, puncturing any scar tissue you might’ve built up from previous treatments of the subject. A fascinating hybrid of suspense thriller, character study, and memory play, Nolan’s three-hour, CGI-free gabfest was his own Grand Budapest Hotel—meaning, the one even his most committed detractors had to acknowledge as significant. That this movie grossed $950 million worldwide suggests that maybe we can have nice things, at least sometimes. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Dec 29, 2023"," Many films about powder-keg men tend to be little more than a 90-minute lit fuse. John Trengove’s dark, claustrophobic, and very close-to-home Manodrome has the slow-churning tension we’ve come to expect from stories about loners getting ready to blow. But watching the downfall of Ralphie (Jesse Eisenberg), a scared and drifting bundle of neuroses and sallow discontent, feels like a larger societal indictment.  With Oppenheimer, possibly the most anticipated film of 2023, Christopher Nolan has hit a home run yet again but has done so by subverting our expectations, reinventing himself – and detonating the scale and scope of what we thought was possible in moviemaking. It is a drama about the creation of the atomic bomb that’s not much concerned with the bomb at all. It’s a character study of a man whose character remains impenetrable to this day. It is a relentless examination of ethical and moral decision-making in a situation where no outcome could possibly be ruled ethically or morally right. More than anything, Oppenheimer is a tale of selling global domination as utilitarian benevolence by (heaps of) men posing as “patriots” but essentially uninterested in anything except their own position in the new world order.  One of recent memory’s most impressive writing and directing debuts, Celine Song’s Past Lives creates heart-pounding drama out of the teensiest slivers of story. Decades after burgeoning playwright Nora (Greta Lee) emigrated from South Korea, she gets in touch with Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), the quiet boy she was once close friends with and possibly in love with. They have grown apart—she is now a wry, urbane, and married cynic while he is still single, with a stoic surface barely covering a roiling romanticism.  Errol Morris’ The Pigeon Tunnel follows a wily, cynical, yet chipper John le Carré down a rabbit hole of Cold War moral ambiguity. Like most of the men Morris films for his documentaries on the intersection of power, politics, warfare, and hubris (The Fog of War, The Unknown Known, American Dharma), the late David Cornwell (le Carré is his pen name) is a controlled and conniving presence working assiduously to present a particular image. Unlike those figures (Robert McNamara, Donald Rumsfeld, and Steve Bannon, respectively), who cast their kind of reality-bending forcefield, Cornwell is fully upfront about his machinations. “This is a performance art,” he says, leaving just enough uncertainty about whether he means just the interview with Morris, his writing, or his entire life.  Are women fated to be locked in an eternal struggle for freedom and control? Will women ever be free, even if technology controls nature? Who is in control of the technology?  It’s always been an identity fundament of many self-proclaimed eccentric auteurs not to do “normal”, except Yorgos Lanthimos actually doesn’t do normal. Poor Things, easily the Greek director’s best film to date, transcends his usual contained dialogues and sparse environments for a maximalist carnival of world-building and discovery from a woman just learning what it means to be alive. Based on the 1992 novel by Scottish author Alasdair Gray and a screenplay by Tony Mcnamara, Poor Things details the life of Bella Baxter (a brilliant Emma Stone), a young Victorian woman resurrected by a deformed scientist Godwin Baxter (Willem Defoe just doing his thing), who takes her on as a “guardian”, keeping her enclosed on his estate.  In her early days, Bella, like a baby, learns to walk, speak, and socialize, but soon enough, she discovers sexuality and starts to yearn for emancipation. After a horny man pig of a lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn (a hilarious Marc Ruffalo), enters Bella’s little world, she runs off with him to “explore the world”. On the way, amid hyper-saturated, surrealist images of Lanthimos’ and Gray’s richly imaginative, bizarre world, Bella will transcend any notion of being Frankenstein’s monster, instead growing into a whip-smart and resourceful woman.  It’s almost unbelievable that the 82 palpitating, palm-sweating, borderline insane minutes of Reality are based on verbatim conversations between Reality Winner, a former US Intelligence employee, and a couple of FBI agents who’ve arrived to raid her home on suspicion she leaked classified documents – but they are. For better or worse, this incredulity that borders on the uncanny is why a conversation between a 27-year-old NSA translator and two sleuth hounds already made for stellar material for Tina Satter’s 2019 play, Is This a Room? (an actual line spoken by one of the agents).  This year’s film version, a crime docudrama co-written with James Paul Dallas and directed by Satter in her feature debut, is a visceral upgrade of the stage experience, and we have a phenomenal cast and assuredly claustrophobic direction to thank. Sydney Sweeney is unbearably efficient as Winner, cornered and mauled by agents Garrick and Taylor, who attempt to sweet-talk (!) her into confessing her involvement in the leak. As the smiling Garrick (a bone-chilling Josh Hamilton) “kindy coerces” Winner to move from the porch into an empty room of her own home for interrogation, the ludicrous sadism of evasion as a tactical weapon, hiding beneath the veneers of banality as commonplace benevolence, gets you in a chokehold and doesn’t let up.  The MCU is wheezing into its What Do We Do Without Robert Downey Jr.? phase. DC keeps trying to armageddon themselves into relevance through sheer volume and excess. Only one corner of the over-crowded comic book cinemaverse is worth paying attention to now. That is the Miles Morales series. It started with 2018’s smashingly fun Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and continues with this hyperactive, winningly sweet, and gorgeously drawn animated adventure.  Zar Amir Ebrahimi and Guy Nattiv’s Tatami is a quietly impressive film. With time, it might well be considered a masterpiece. Tatami’s monochrome cinematography perhaps unconsciously builds on the political conflicts within the story, between the coercion of the Islamic Republic and Leila’s (Arienne Mandi) resistance to feign an injury at the Judo World Championships. Tatami is a political film, but it’s also a story about the conflict and unimaginable choice between the love of one’s family and one’s values. Its suspense derives from the film’s engagement with the audience. We feel the weight of pressure on Leila and anger towards the agents of the Islamic Republic who lurk, issuing her with threatening ultimatums. We fear for the safety of Leila’s husband and daughter, and we feel anger towards her parents, who also tried to coerce her. Indeed, Tatami stirs the audience’s emotions to fuel the suspense. “I’ll go to war for you. Against anyone. Do you understand that?” roars Inez at her six-year-old son Terry into a payphone in Brooklyn. A convicted thief, too young to be a mother, she’s a Black woman who wants her son out of foster care and back with her. When Terry accuses her of abandonment, she promises not to leave him again – the first step being abducting him from a hospital and running off to Harlem. So begins A Thousand and One, a firecracker debut by writer-director Alina Victoria Rockwell and a showcase for star Teyana Taylor’s rich talent. One part family drama but a 101-part gut-wrenching tale of the appalling reality of Black women and men surviving on the streets, this understated, tactful film reaches incredible heights through the thoughtful subtlety of the script and the loud fearlessness of Taylor’s performance.  Over more than a decade (1994-2005), we watch Inez fight with all she’s got to build a functional home for her kind and gifted son amid incessant gentrification, institutional racism, and problematic personal relationships; despite her crime, we start rooting for her. ”Nobody gives a shit about black women except black women, and even that shit get messy!,” Inez screams at one point, winning over sympathy not by victimizing herself but for persevering despite a dire pole position and endless hurdles. As inspiring as it is to watch Taylor soar as a “me against the world” hustler, the real marvel here is Rockwell, who commands every word and frame with maturity and poise seldom seen in young auteurs.  Jonathan Glazer’s adaptation of Martin Amis’ novel, The Zone of Interest, is the year’s most unsettling film. Focusing on the commandant of Auschwitz and his wife’s idyllic life in the house and garden next door to the concentration camp, we only hear the sounds of cries and machinery and see smoke rise from the chimneys. Refusing to look upon the horror conveys the Nazi indifference towards the Jews and emphasises the inhumane cruelty that permitted the genocidal atrocities. Watching the mundane rituals, the family’s comfort and security, while on the other side of a wall, human beings are deprived of life and dignity, is a provocative statement. What’s striking is how The Zone of Interest utilises the power of the spoken word to express the disturbing events that it refuses to gaze upon. The rudimentary and practical conversation about the efficiency of the incinerators, for example, contextualises the passive acceptance of industrialised slaughter as, pardon the choice of phrase, “business as usual”.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2023", It's finally time to talk Oppenheimer here on the MAM main feed. Thanks to our VIPs for digging into the episode last week. Did Christopher Nolan deliver the goods with this one? Let's discuss!,POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023"," Oppenheimer, dirigida por Christopher Nolan, muestra su intención desde las primeras escenas. La de contar dos historias a la vez, a través de líneas temporales distintas que corren en paralelo. Por un lado, la versión de Julius Robert Oppenheimer​ (Cillian Murphy) sobre el papel que le tocó protagonizar en un momento crítico. Al otro, un hecho histórico total y en cierta medida violento, que cambió para siempre, el equilibrio de poder en el mundo y la forma de entender la capacidad destructiva humana.  Pero la cinta, no es, ni una biografía, ni tampoco, esencialmente, un drama histórico. El argumento se mueve los dos géneros y mantiene un delicado equilibrio a partir de dos visiones de la verdad. ¿Qué llevó a Oppenheimer a enfocar toda su determinación en crear un arma que, sabía, sería una fractura siniestra para la época? ¿Qué hizo necesario la fabricación de la bomba atómica en un período en el que el fantasma de la guerra era más real y amenazante que nunca?  Christopher Nolan no intenta explorar en lo moral, mucho menos, en la percepción acerca de un dilema ético en puertas. Lo que desea es algo más audaz y lo logra a través de un argumento denso y angustioso. Dejar claro que tanto Oppenheimer como Estados Unidos no hicieron otra cosa que aceptar un destino inevitable. El de avanzar contra reloj y vencer el mal contemporáneo que se gestaba en Europa bajo la sombra de los nazis.  Oppenheimer, de Christopher Nolan, es un acercamiento meticuloso y oscuro a una parte controvertida de la historia norteamericana. A través de la figura del científico, el director se adentra en cuestionamientos directos - y casi políticos - acerca de la carrera armamentista, la paz y la guerra. Lo que permite al argumento mostrar una dura época en que el mal menor era la única opción entre posibilidades, catastróficas. Pero la cinta, es también un logro técnico de considerable envergadura. No solo por el uso de un punto de vista subjetivo y otro objetivo, separados a través de uso del color. También, por la forma en que el guion y la edición, crean una atmósfera tenebrosa para avanzar hacia una tragedia. Puede parecer una justificación acerca a la carrera armamentista en plena Segunda Guerra Mundial. Pero el relato evita caer en posiciones maniqueas y muestra dos extremos de los sucesos que cuenta. Oppenheimer es un hombre convencido que la bomba atómica es una necesidad. En el mejor de los casos, una batalla a ciegas por evitar que un enemigo despiadado logre primero un triunfo científico de crucial importancia.  Christopher Nolan muestra al personaje desde sus contradicciones y lo humaniza, gracias a una tensión interior que se vuelve más tenebrosa a medida que avanza la narración. Gradualmente, el científico titular comprende las múltiples consecuencias de sus decisiones. El hecho que está creando una posibilidad del futuro cuyos alcances son, en esencia y de manera forzosa, desastrosos.  Pero para el físico teórico, no hay escapatoria. En el mejor de los casos, sabe que la decisión es por un mal menor. El guion, también escrito por el realizador, tiene la suficiente habilidad al explorar en la oscuridad del personaje sin juicios. Desde sus primeras apariciones, Oppenheimer es un hombre empecinado en lograr una forma de justicia. En detener una guerra, en tomar decisiones que nadie más podría.  La trama lo convierte en una figura por momentos despiadada y en otras, abrumada por el peso insospechado de un protagonismo histórico que nunca pidió. Mucho menos, que sabe cómo entender, sustentar o elevar más allá del esfuerzo cada vez más desesperado por cumplir su deber. ¿Cuál es ese? La de evitar que una arma de potencia para una hecatombe esté en manos nazis.  No obstante, bajo esa obsesión, subyace la osadía, la necesidad de improvisar, de comprobar las teorías largamente meditadas. Según el guion, Oppenheimer precisa encontrar un sentido a un esfuerzo intelectual que se compagina con sentimientos viscerales.  La película no hace sencilla la percepción de su personaje principal y en ocasiones, enfatiza su cualidad temeraria. Pero a la vez, la angustia existencial de saber que lo que lleva a cabo, le empujará, pronto o más tarde, a un horror inevitable. Una y otra vez, el relato deja entrever qué tan consciente estuvo el científico que su obra solo era el comienzo de una tragedia histórica. También, el escaso margen de maniobra que tuvo para evitarlo.  La trama utiliza algunas trampas sutiles en un intento de ocultar su narración a dos tiempos. La más inteligente y bien planteada, las tomas en blanco y negro que muestran la realidad detrás de la vida de Oppenheimer. Poco a poco, el relato se completa a sí mismo al mostrar el mundo que el científico tuvo que enfrentar. A la vez, los duros procesos interiores que le empujaron hacia contradicciones cada vez más evidentes en su criterio. El montaje pone a ambas situaciones en paralelo, aunque es obvio que ocurren antes o después de la línea central de los eventos.  Pero el director se asegura que el relato y la edición, no den señales precisas de cuando ocurre cada suceso. De modo que la película parece encontrarse en un presente sutil y atemporal en que todo ocurre a la vez. La única señal notoria de hacia dónde transita la historia, es, por supuesto, el estallido de la bomba atómica. El temible e inquietante momento, en todos los esfuerzos, temores, esperanzas y ambiciones, se transforman en fuego puro. No se trata de una metáfora. Christopher Nolan encamina todos sus esfuerzos a recorrer cada detalle que conformó el proyecto Manhattan y la prueba Trinity. Lo que incluye, largos debates sobre ética, el peligro en puertas y la codicia de una época en que el riesgo atómico no era comparable al del enemigo con mejor armamento. El director y guionista es competente y formalmente sobrio, al contar meticulosamente una serie de sucesos, pero no en orden lineal. De manera que la cinta va desde Los Alamos, a una audiencia en el Congreso estadounidense hasta los diversos lugares en que las mentes más extraordinarias del mundo fueron reclutadas.  Es entonces, cuando el largometraje hace gala de su espléndido elenco. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), se convierte en un hilo conductor de sucesos y situaciones. Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), tiene la firmeza necesaria de interpelar a su esposo, aunque el guion desaprovecha algunos de los mejores debates entre ambos. En especial, cuando deben asumir la carga de la responsabilidad que les incluye en una posibilidad aterradora. La de ser los artífices de un posible final de la historia humana.  A través de la pareja, Oppenheimer plantea la idea que el logro del científico fue más una combinación de conocimientos y talentos. Que, a la vez, incluyó todo un contexto que le empujó a dar respuestas inmediatas a un dilema de la época. El guion explora en Norteamérica, convertida en el responsable de la paz mundial. También, en el único país — y sistema — capaz de encarar primero a los nazis y después, la posibilidad del poderío soviético.  Algo parecido ocurre con el resto de los personajes. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) tiene el peculiar peso de una voz de la conciencia para Oppenheimer, aunque el personaje —y la interpretación de la actriz— parece sub utilizados. Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) formula las preguntas necesarias y las incómodas, aunque la mayoría no tienen respuestas. Al otro lado, el Ernest Lawrence (Josh Harnett) es la encarnación de un país que desea vencer. Que sueña con la percepción del triunfo científico como moneda de cambio por la estabilidad global.  Incluso, la aproximación a Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) es brillante en su sentido sobre la consecuencia política que sustituye la moral. Cuando finalmente se imputa y se señala a Oppenheimer por el invento que trajo la muerte y la victoria, no se realiza a partir del juicio ético. Al menos, Strauss no lo hace. Christopher Nolan usa a la figura para explorar en EE. UU. como escenario de una guerra frontal contra cualquier oposición. La arrogancia del poderío militar convertido en temor y amenaza subyacente.  La película se sostiene bien entre múltiples escenarios, conversaciones y datos. Pero su gran objetivo, por supuesto, es mostrar la hecatombe atómica en todo su poderío, belleza terrorífica y detalle. La tan anunciada explosión es un logro técnico y visual que deslumbra y es, de hecho, lo que probablemente definirá a la película en el futuro. Es la conclusión de ambas líneas históricas y aunque tarda en llegar, sostiene todo lo planteado con anterioridad. De hecho, Oppenheimer analiza la finalidad del horror desde lo utilitario. La explosión de la bomba se describe con detalle y casi a través de los códigos del cine de terror. Es el miedo, de todos los personajes, de una nación entera, del mundo de la época, construido y sostenido en una llamarada que Christopher Nolan muestra casi mítica. Lenguas de fuego que avasallan cualquier debate y que profundizan en los puntos filosóficos planteados hasta entonces. La muerte es inevitable para la paz. La amenaza, para el equilibrio. El mensaje más escalofriante que la película deja a su paso. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023"," Imaginemos
que se ha anunciado con meses de anticipaciÃ³n un gran evento, una gran fiesta.
La fiesta promete ser de las mejores del aÃ±o. Las entradas se venden agotando
funciones como si se tratara de conciertos de Coldplay o Taylor Swift en
Argentina, donde nadie entiende de dÃ³nde sale ese dinero en un paÃ­s en crisis.
Al entrar a la fiesta, observamos y detectamos dos sectores VIP con ambientes
totalmente distintos. A la derecha, un grupo de hombres y mujeres elegantes de
traje y vestidos largos toman whisky, alguna que otra cerveza; todo parece muy
clÃ¡sico y hasta un poco pretencioso. A la izquierda, una explosiÃ³n de colores y
risas. Los daiquiris de frutilla van y vienen mientras los invitados bailan
como adolescentes mientras del otro lado de la habitaciÃ³n el primer grupo
dialoga sobre la complejidad del espacio-tiempo y el destino humano. A la
derecha, el grupo estÃ¡ encabezado por Chirstopher Nolan, quien tiene a su lado
a un Cillian Murphy que apenas se ha quitado su boina de los Peaky Blinders. A
la izquierda, estÃ¡ Greta Gerwig acompaÃ±ada por una esplendorosa Margot Robbie
vestida de rosa. Los grupos
son las pelÃ­culas dirigidas por sus referentes; Oppenheimer de Nolan, y Barbie
de Gerwig. Â¿La ubicaciÃ³n de la fiesta? Una sala de cine. Y la incÃ³gnita acerca
de dÃ³nde ha salido tanto dinero para comprar entradas en plena crisis econÃ³mica
hace referencia a otra pregunta: Â¿de dÃ³nde surgiÃ³ tanto interÃ©s por parte del
pÃºblico por ir al cine cuando lo Ãºnico que las cifras demuestran es el
menguante interÃ©s por asistir a las salas de cine? La fiesta se llama Barbieheimer
y ha sido el evento cinematogrÃ¡fico mejor promocionado del aÃ±o. Nosotros
nos acercamos a la barra y pedimos una bebida para estar a tono, respiramos
hondo y nos adentramos en el laberinto filosÃ³fico que se presenta al entrar en
la filmografÃ­a del director de pelÃ­culas como Memento, la trilogÃ­a de Batman:
The Dark Night, The Prestige, Inception o Dunkirk. Hoy, hablamos de
la Ãºltima pelÃ­cula del director inglÃ©s: Oppenheimer. Adaptada
del libro publicado en 2005 y escrito por Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin Prometeo
Americano: El triunfo y la tragedia de J. Robert Oppenheimer, la Ãºltima
pelÃ­cula de Nolan funciona, al menos en un inicio, como una especie de pelÃ­cula
biogrÃ¡fica sobre el fÃ­sico teÃ³rico estadounidense J. Robert Oppenheimer, quien
estuvo al mando del Proyecto Manhattan. En Ã©l, un numeroso grupo de cientÃ­ficos
âbajo lineamiento, control, gestiÃ³n y financiaciÃ³n militarâ terminarÃ­a por
concebir y posteriormente detonar la primera bomba atÃ³mica en lo que se conociÃ³
como la prueba Trinity, que desembocarÃ­a en las dos bombas que Estados Unidos
lanzarÃ­a sobre Hiroshima y Nagasaki en agosto de 1945, que acabaron con la vida
de mÃ¡s de 200.000 japoneses. A gran
escala, ese es el hilo conductor de la pelÃ­cula, pero Nolan, basÃ¡ndose en el
libro de Bird y Sherwin, va mÃ¡s allÃ¡: hace uso de su vasta experiencia en los
relatos no lineales y su control desahogado sobre el montaje y propone lo que
termina por convertirse en una segunda pelÃ­cula dentro de Oppenheimer.
Porque Oppenheimer es tanto una biopic como es un thriller
judicial. En el
relato, esto se construye en pelÃ­culas paralelas. Por un lado, la parte mÃ¡s atractiva,
entretenida, digerible, en la que Nolan hace que sus declaraciones sobre no
haber utilizado ningÃºn efecto visual generado de manera digital (CGI) se luzcan
con grandilocuencia. Se cuentan los inicios de Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) como
cientÃ­fico y el proceso de creaciÃ³n de la bomba nuclear, siempre desde su
punto de vista. En paralelo, esto se articula con esta segunda pelÃ­cula, el thriller
judicial, que Nolan presenta en blanco y negro. AllÃ­ toma principalmente el
punto de vista del personaje de Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), empresario y
funcionario pÃºblico que presidirÃ­a la ComisiÃ³n de EnergÃ­a AtÃ³mica de Estados
Unidos y que a lo largo de los aÃ±os distanciarÃ­a cada vez mÃ¡s su ideologÃ­a de
la de Oppenheimer, algo que Nolan construye a travÃ©s del uso del punto de vista
de manera inteligente para hacer que estos hechos resulten cinematogrÃ¡ficos y
no simplemente anecdÃ³ticos. Es en este
juego de construir un relato doble que amalgame los sucesos de las diferentes
temporalidades que la pelÃ­cula puede llegar a perderse (y al espectador) por el
simple uso de su forma, puesta por encima del contenido. En toda la tendencia
de Nolan hay cierto interÃ©s por parte del autor por recurrir a diÃ¡logos
exhaustivos y temÃ¡ticas complejas que pueden, en el mejor de los casos,
desafiar el intelecto o capacidad de comprensiÃ³n y concentraciÃ³n del espectador,
y, en el peor, volverse conceptualmente vacÃ­os. Y en este caso, Nolan se
arriesga al cuadrado. No es fÃ¡cil para el espectador promedio seguir los
razonamientos y diÃ¡logos de fÃ­sicos, matemÃ¡ticos, quÃ­micos, ingenieros, etc.
Pero tampoco es completamente accesible toda la jerga judicial y polÃ­tica que
se utiliza en las secuencias de blanco y negro en relaciÃ³n al juicio/audiencia
que se le imparte a Oppenheimer. Sin
embargo, a pesar de estos tropezones, Nolan busca, a fin de cuentas, sembrarnos
la duda acerca de los grises que caracterizan a su protagonista (y al verdadero
Oppenheimer). Nos lleva a lugares incÃ³modos, tematizando los conceptos del bien
y del mal y dejando latente la idea de que Oppenheimer fue despojado de su
humanidad por esa obsesiÃ³n con la que generalmente se construye tanto
arquetÃ­picamente como estereotÃ­picamente a los cientÃ­ficos en este tipo de
narrativas. Para lograrlo, Nolan propone secuencias que repite en reiteradas
ocasiones donde de manera sensorial, a travÃ©s de todos los recursos
audiovisuales posibles, nos adentra en la mente de Oppenheimer. Esto genera una
sensaciÃ³n de que no estamos simplemente expectantes al borde de una explosiÃ³n
atÃ³mica generada por la bomba; tambiÃ©n hay una cuenta regresiva dentro de su
creador que hace temblar la sala. Nolan es
capaz de transmitir esta idea acerca de lo sensorial a travÃ©s de todas sus
decisiones y en conjunto con grandes colaboradores: el uso de efectos prÃ¡cticos
y no visuales que se sienten reales y amenazantes (algo extremadamente valioso
en una Ã©poca donde el CGI se ha vuelto cada vez mÃ¡s lamentable), la mÃºsica
original de Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, que acompaÃ±a al montaje a veces confuso y otras
completamente funcional de Jennifer Lame, y el broche de oro de la fotografÃ­a de
Hoyte van Hoytema (quien se merece un premio, no solo por su trabajo en la
pelÃ­cula, sino porque no debe ser fÃ¡cil lidiar con los caprichos y demandas de
Nolan a nivel visual). Esta hace que Oppenheimer sea, a diferencia de
muchas pelÃ­culas estrenadas Ãºltimamente, una experiencia para disfrutar (o
padecer, dependiendo de los gustos) en una sala de cine. Y logra que, a pesar
de tratarse de una pelÃ­cula de tres horas que nos desafÃ­a en mÃ¡s de un sentido,
valga la pena. Pero a
pesar de todo esto, Oppemheimer lucha por momentos contra su propio
discurso. Hay cuestiones no resueltas a nivel de guion acerca de la idea de
Oppenheimer como mÃ¡rtir. Esto es algo que se plantea y de lo que es muy difÃ­cil
alejarse por la forma en la que la pelÃ­cula es contada y por cÃ³mo conocemos su
intimidad, sus momentos de crisis, sus batallas, no solo contra sÃ­ mismo, sino
contra un Estados Unidos que lo persigue por tener conexiones con el Partido Comunista
a pesar de no ser miembro de este directamente, o su lugar de mando medio en
algo que era mucho mÃ¡s grande que Ã©l y sobre lo que su control era transitorio
y relativo. Pero esta
idea de mÃ¡rtir choca directamente contra otros pasajes de la pelÃ­cula a nivel
de guion. Se afirma y reafirma posteriormente que Oppenheimer participÃ³ de las
decisiones que llevaron a que sus armas fueran utilizadas, y no fuera simplemente
una posibilidad. Esto, mÃ¡s que sembrar la duda, hace que sea muy difÃ­cil
empatizar con este personaje, que gran parte de la pelÃ­cula se busca
victimizar, a pesar de haber, aÃºn en vida, expresado su trauma y
arrepentimiento luego de su creaciÃ³n. Oppenheimer
es una explosiÃ³n a nivel de experiencia cinematogrÃ¡fica, a pesar de que
irÃ³nicamente puede por momentos implosionar en contra de sÃ­ misma,
principalmente a causa de ciertas secuencias de guion que terminan por quitarle
peso a uno de los eventos mÃ¡s esperados del aÃ±o. MÃ¡s aÃºn, a una de las
secuencias cinematogrÃ¡ficas mÃ¡s esperadas del aÃ±o (la explosiÃ³n de la bomba
realizada con efectos prÃ¡cticos en su totalidad), que pasa, al menos en un
primer visionado o sin previo aviso, prÃ¡cticamente desapercibida. Lo que sÃ­
no pasa para nada desapercibido, y es digno de menciÃ³n porque habla mucho sobre
el prestigio y lo importante que puede resultar Nolan para la industria, es la
cantidad de actores y actrices de primer nivel que participan de la pelÃ­cula. Si
bien la pelÃ­cula, desde el lado actoral, es cargada por Murphy y Downey Jr.,
cuenta con un apoyo y espaldarazo constante de talentos como Emily Blunt,
Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Ben Safdie y Jason Clarke. Y como si esto fuera
poco, muchos otros actores impresionantes se limitan a hacer apariciones de
Ãºnicamente una o dos escenas, y no llegan quizÃ¡s al minuto en pantalla (Tom
Conti, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, etc.). Esto
deja en claro que Oppenheimer es un proyecto de un calibre de producciÃ³n
que âmÃ¡s que cameos innecesariosâ cuenta con el apoyo de referentes de la
industria que confÃ­an no solo en los dÃ³lares de su director, sino tambiÃ©n en el
resultado final de su trabajo, y quieren ser invitados en la fiesta mÃ¡s
esperada del aÃ±o. Esto es para poder mejorar el intercambio entre los usuarios y que sea un lugar que respete las normas de convivencia.

"Dec 22, 2023"," If you add the first title on this list to the last one, you get the biggest moviegoing event of the year. It feels fitting to bookend 2023’s ranking with Barbenheimer, a moment of sheer, unadulterated enthusiasm for movies that drove box office numbers through the roof, because when I think back on the year in film, I still feel giddy. It was a terrific year at the movies. Heavyweights such as Ari Aster, Greta Gerwig, Christopher Nolan, and Martin Scorsese delivered career-defining works, while newcomers Chloe Domont, Molly Manning Walker, and Celine Song surprised us with films we couldn’t stop talking about. Coming up with 10 movies I was eager to endorse was easy. And I haven’t even seen Poor Things yet. But 2023 wasn’t all rainbows and bright-yellow rollerblades. In May, the Writers Guild of America went on strike, with screenwriters demanding higher wages and job security to keep up with the nebulous streaming landscape. In July, SAG-AFTRA followed suit. The strikes kept Hollywood quiet for several months, pushing projects such as Dune: Part Two into next year. Much more importantly, they underscored the industry’s dire need for change.  Then a few trying months later, it got some. The WGA reached what they called an “exceptional” deal in September, while SAG-AFTRA approved a new contract with bonuses and protections in November. Hollywood is still recovering from the pause in work, and it’s still an imperfect industry for working writers and actors. But it’s a step in the right direction. We gave it a viral marketing campaign free of charge, we went to movie theaters in droves to watch it, we debated about whether it was a groundbreaking work of feminism (it’s not) or merely a two-hour advertisement for a toy company (Mattel made it so, yeah). Gerwig’s Barbie became so central to the zeitgeist this year that it’s easy to lose sight of how deeply bizarre the whole thing is. Of course, Barbie is a brand extension exercise, but it’s an audacious, hilarious, and artistically crafted one, raising the bar considerably for big-budget intellectual property ventures to come. What makes a good life? That’s the question at the center of Chronicles of a Wandering Saint, a small, special film by newcomer Tomás Gómez Bustillo that played this year’s Latin American Film Festival. Rita (Mónica Villa) is an elderly custodian obsessed with becoming the most pious resident of her rural Argentine town. With a needle drop you’ll want to write home about, Chronicles takes a magical realist turn that forces Rita to realize that getting what you prayed for isn’t all it’s made out to be. Ostensibly Aster’s departure from horror, Beau Is Afraid might be the director’s scariest film yet. A sprawling, uncanny, three-hour fever dream, the movie is an odyssey through the psyche of Beau (Joaquin Phoenix), a middle-aged Jewish guy with a pocket full of mommy and daddy issues. Beau Is Afraid takes a lot of big swings and comes up with more than a few misses, but it also hits a few home runs, offering brilliant, farcical depictions of a mind tortured by anxiety. Judy Blume had declined numerous offers to option her beloved book Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret over the years, knowing that her 1970 novel, which follows an insightful 11-year-old through her puberty growing pains, had become a sacred text to girls everywhere. She finally handed the rights over to Kelly Fremon Craig (The Edge of Seventeen), and the resulting adaptation is a tender window into girlhood and family that slightly expands the scope of its source text without sacrificing any of its wisdom. Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio have once again teamed up to make a movie about greedy, evil men, but this is no Wolf of Wall Street. Killers of the Flower Moon tells the true story of the systematic murdering of Osage Nation members in 1920s Oklahoma, carried out by White men who were after Osage oil money. DiCaprio and Robert De Niro are superbly monstrous, while Lily Gladstone is remarkably enigmatic as Mollie Kyle. Well over three hours long, Killers doesn’t exactly go down easy, but rises to the brutal occasion at hand, resulting in one of the greatest cinematic feats of the year. At the center of May December is the terrible tabloid affair between Gracie (Julianne Moore) and Joe (Charles Melton), whose relationship began when Joe was in the seventh grade and Gracie was 24 years his senior. Usually, most of us wouldn’t spend more than one People magazine article with such a story, but director Todd Haynes brings us intimately close to the controversial couple through the eyes of Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who is shadowing the lispy Gracie for an upcoming movie. May December is a disturbing portrait of abuse, and a campy parody of performance. When Samuel falls to his death from the balcony of his Alpine chalet, all eyes are on his wife, a successful, unapologetic writer named Sandra (an excellent Sandra Hüller). Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or winning Anatomy of a Fall begins as a gripping courtroom drama about whether Sandra murdered her husband then transforms into a forensic analysis of a marriage between two flawed people, raising rich questions about gender, partnership, and love. Brands had quite the spring at the movies. March saw the release of Flamin’ Hot and Tetris, two films depicting the inception of their title products. Air, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon’s ode to the minds behind Nike’s Air Jordan shoe, arrived in April. By the time Matt Johnson’s BlackBerry rolled around in May, the world seemed ready to move on from the corporate origin story, and with good reason. But it’s a shame that BlackBerry emerged in the shadow of those movies, because it couldn’t be further from the Airs and Flamin’ Hots of the world. Instead of worshiping at the altar of its title brand, BlackBerry scrutinizes the people and the system that created it, making it more akin to David Fincher’s The Social Network. Jay Baruchel is wonderful as BlackBerry creator Mike Lazaridis, but it’s Glenn Howerton who steals the show as co-CEO Jim Balsillie, giving a hysterical, hot-tempered performance that could slot right into an episode of Succession. Movies do a lot of things. They entertain, they educate, they make audiences laugh and cry and jump out of their upholstered reclining seats. And on special occasions, they linger, imparting an image, feeling, or idea that leaves their viewer a bit different than they were before. Past Lives is a special occasion. Celine Song’s stirring debut feature revolves around a few key moments in the lives of a New York-based writer (Greta Lee), the childhood sweetheart she left in Korea (Teo Yoo), and her loving present-day husband (John Magaro). The film’s beating heart is the Korean concept of in-yun, which suggests that people gravitate to each other because they overlapped in a previous lifetime. Though small in scope, Past Lives is emotionally enormous, unearthing a bittersweet truth about the lives we lead with the people we love—and lives, and people, we never get to. The morning of Barbenheimer, a holiday I had anticipated like it was Christmas, a series of logistical misfortunes fit for a sitcom caused my friend and me to arrive late to the theater. By the time we tiptoed our way into our seats for Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project was already underway. Despite our 27-minute fumble, Oppenheimer delivered one of the most exhilarating and harrowing movie theater experiences I’ve ever had, painting a larger-than-life portrait of power—both nuclear and political—petulance, and penitence.  Days later, I returned to the theater to see it in its entirety, and that riveting first watch shriveled in comparison. Though I wouldn’t exactly recommend it, accidentally watching Oppenheimer like it was Nolan’s 2000 time-bending thriller Memento made the director’s gift for storytelling plain as day. Nolan’s career-long interest in timeline manipulation has been the subject of praise and the punchline of jokes; here, it’s the making of a masterpiece, elevating what in lesser hands could have been a conventional historical drama into an urgent, unforgettable work. With great artistry and relentless precision, Oppenheimer tells the story of the man who created the nuclear bomb, and was haunted by the fallout for the rest of his life. Pay attention, and you’ll be haunted too. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s much-touted, three hour bio pic Oppenheimer presents itself as a serious look at the complex moral depth of a brilliant man. But really it’s just a standard Hollywood hagiography, which uses standard-issue Hollywood emotional and intellectual shortcuts to enlist the audience in patriotic horseshit. From his cowardly refusal to give a single Japanese victim a speaking role, to his manipulative use of black and white to give sentimental nonsense a patina of authenticity, Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation. Critics who have embraced this nonsense should be ashamed of themselves. The unwieldy, endless three-hour movie is more or less framed around Oppenheimer’s 1954 security hearing, in which he was stripped of security clearance and disgraced because of his past Communist ties and because of his discomfort with developing the H-bomb. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) tells his life story to the committee, as Nolan cuts away to portray that life via epic blaring soundtrack and interpolation of dramatic incendiary graphics, illustrating the atomic whoosh and boom inside Oppenheimer’s head. More pedestrianly, the movie follows Oppenheimer as a young man studying the new physics in Europe, emphasizing his brilliance, his idiosyncrasy, his passion for justice which leads him into Communist circles, his philandering, his ambition, and his hatred of the Nazis. All of this culminates in his leadership of the Manhattan Project and the successful development of the atomic bomb, which is dropped on Japan rather than Germany, sparking in Oppenheimer ambivalent Doubts. Again, the movie makes a pretense of sharing or exploring those doubts. But the truth is Nolan couldn’t care less about the question of whether it was a good idea to drop not one, but two atomic bombs and kill hundreds of thousands of non combatants, including children. And you can tell he doesn’t care because he raises these issues most insistently in the context of that security clearance hearing, which he presents as the most immoral thing in the film—far more immoral than murdering civilians. The hearing is, we’re told, payback from bureaucrat Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who Oppenheimer once embarrassed in a public hearing. Strauss decides to destroy Oppenheimer’s career as payback, leaking his security file to a rabid anti-Communist with ties to J. Edgar Hoover. The hearing is presented as a farce, and Strauss eventually ends up ranting like a super-villain, his manipulations condemned even by his own supine staff. The actual ethics of Oppenheimer’s complicity in the bomb is gently nuked by the familiar mechanics of melodrama; Oppenheimer becomes the good guy by virtue of being persecuted by the bad guy. The corpses the good guy is responsible for are relegated to hallucinatory dream where their moral weight is secondary to their role as symbolic demonstrations of the intricacies of his character. The film uses the anti Communist witch hunts to duck the ethics of nuclear annihilation. But it doesn’t really deal with the ethics of the witch hunts either. We’re told over and over that Oppenheimer was never a real Communist, which allows the movie to mostly avoid taking sides on whether persecuting actual Communists was justified or not. The most prominent party member in the film, Oppenheimer’s lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is carefully delegitimized; she’s presented as mentally unstable in no small part through persistent hypersexualization. Much of the discussion of Tatlock has centered on whether portraying sex and nudity in film is ever justified, which has neatly elided what the sex and nudity in this film is doing. Oppenheimer has a number of lovers, but Tatlock is the only one shown topless or having sex with him at all, and she’s practically more nude in the movie than not. Nudity in this film isn’t equated with pleasure, sensuality, or self-exploration (as in, for example, Don’t Worry, Darling.) Instead, it’s linked to exposure and humiliation. In the scene where he discusses his relationship with Tatlock before the committee, Oppenheimer himself is nude, and we see him and Jean having sex before the censorious security inspectors, in a half dream sequence that’s meant to cast the judges as voyeurs and Oppenheimer as helpless.  Oppenheimer’s nudity is weakness; by extension, so is Jean’s, in this scene and in others. The nudity and sex are necessary because the nudity and sex are the primary way through which the film characterizes Tatlock as unstable and pitiful. Her Communist beliefs are less important than the bare skin that strips them of meaning. Since sex is who Tatlock is, you don’t need to think too much about whether her ideas influenced Oppenheimer. Ultimately, Oppenheimer’s most important relationship in the film isn’t with Tatlock, or Strauss, or his wife, but with Einstein (Tom Conti). Einstein only has a walk on part, but the short encounters between the two men are thematically central. That’s especially the case for a discussion after the bomb has been dropped which is revisited multiple times, once at the very end of the film. The exchange takes place outside; standing beside a scenic pond, Einstein, white-haired wise man and God surrogate, gives Oppenheimer his blessing, assuring him that his legacy is important and that the guilt he bears is a kind of sanctification. Oppenheimer reiterates his loyalty to the United States and then, in an ectomorphic, beatific close up, utters some sententious lines about how he set off a chain reaction which destroyed the world. And what is that moral? It gently evaporates in a gush of deference and awe—at the hugeness of the bomb, and the hugeness of Hollywood. Oppenheimer, like Nolan, is the director of vast human resources in pursuit of a massive payload. The actual meaning, or use, of the mechanism is less important than its power—a power which justifies both the creator and the nation-state in whose name the power is deployed. As Viet Thanh Nguyen has argued, the “Hollywood industrial complex…is crucial to the military industrial complex”; America’s military superiority is justified and advanced by its massively disproportionate control of representation, ideology, memory, and history. It’s in that context that Nolan tells us that Oppenheimer is a good American and a good man not despite the deaths on his conscience, but precisely because those deaths make him complicated and cool. Vacuous hagiography is indistinguishable from vacuous nationalism is indistinguishable from the romanticization of overwhelming force, in the form of a huge honking explosion and/or the huge honking movie that blandly justifies it. Thanks, Noah. Your review is the best one I have read. As one who has worked in nuclear and especially in the endless clean-up of the nuclear weapons complex, I too had very mixed reactions to this film. I have visited and worked in many of these facilities. Your words helped me solidify my basic feeling that this is a terrible movie. Thanks. Great review.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 9, 2023"," Is the franchise era over? In 2023, a slew of superhero movies earned hundreds of millions of dollars at the box office each and still reportedly failed to make back the money required to produce and market them. Not even Tom Cruise, 2022’s box office savior, could rescue a Mission: Impossible movie from the installment fatigue that has set in across multiplexes — a kind of invasive exhaustion that’s made even the most reliable (or put another way, formulaic) of animated features falter in theaters. All this uncertainty raises a natural question: If franchises are dead, what’s next? As our critics thumbed through the many, many movie releases of 2023 to determine their favorites from the past year, that question loomed. Are there hints for what’s to come, post-Barbenheimer, in the kinds of films that broke through for them when a Paul Rudd–led Marvel title couldn’t? Greta Gerwig’s and Christopher Nolan’s historic releases perhaps provide some clues, though only one of them made our critics’ top-10 lists. In the end, after sifting through the tumult, Bilge Ebiri and Alison Willmore landed on 10 very different films each — not one movie choice made the other’s list. Still, there are similarities: Filmmakers with a penchant for autobiography made both records, movies that clock the existential confusion of being locked inside a career did too. And in a year when it feels safer than ever to say superhero movies are throttling toward their own demise, one of them ended up in our top 20. Perhaps the best answer to what comes next is, simply, more chaos. Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or–winning courtroom drama, about a woman accused of killing her husband after he falls to his death in suspicious fashion, would be gripping enough as a procedural. But it gains transcendence as it begins to question the very nature of truth. Reality, we understand, is something different for each individual, an idea that has particular power in the world today. Anatomy of a Fall, however, isn’t necessarily a Grand Statement About Our Times; Triet and her co-writer and partner, Arthur Harari, have surely imagined this more as an exploration of domestic conflict than anything else. But their observational acuity, their fidelity to life as it’s lived — along with Sandra Huller’s entrancing lead performance — results in something that keeps exploding in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It should have been evident long ago that Wes Anderson’s brand of hyper-controlled whimsy was all an attempt to confront the unhinged madness of the world. And none of us should have been surprised that his work became even more peculiar and more precise as the world became more and more insane. Maybe that’s why Asteroid City feels like such a signature work. Anderson doubles down on his style (how is that even possible at this point?) and gives us a maze-like network of framing devices to tell a story about a group of teenage scientists and their traumatized parents confronting an alien life form in the 1950s. Or wait, is it actually a story about the Actors Studio and turn-of-the-century American theater’s attempt to wrestle with the intricacies of the human heart? Or maybe these are the same thing. Anderson uses all the technique at his disposal to create a beautiful diorama of a world he cannot understand. In the end, isn’t that what great art does? Ira Sachs is a master of the small, delicate gestures that wind up having seismic repercussions in our lives. In Passages, which might be his masterpiece, he fashions the most delectably ruinous of love triangles. A German filmmaker (Franz Rogowski) cheats on his husband (Ben Whishaw) with a woman (Adèle Exarchopoulos), falls in love with her, then begins to have second thoughts as the specter of commitment looms. Rogowski’s character is a total narcissist — a needy, callous, pathetic, selfish chaos agent — but go figure, he’s also quite irresistible. We’re drawn to this man despite the emotional devastation he wreaks, maybe because we sense something of ourselves in him. His destructive immaturity is captivating and relatable. Many of the year’s best films capture the queasy uncertainty of living in this moment, but few do it with such oblique charm as Aki Kaurismaki in this understated romance following two lonely, mismatched souls who keep missing each other. Kaurismaki’s style — somehow both deadpan and tender — is timeless, and one could argue that his stories could be taking place at any moment in history. But look at the ways in which his characters constantly seem on the verge of being tossed aside by the post-human, industrial landscape of Helsinki, and listen to the way that the music on the radio has been replaced by news reports about the war in Ukraine. The world has no place for the individual. And yet here we still are, persisting and yearning and drinking and stewing and fumbling our way through. Ava Duvernay has been so ever-present in the public eye that it’s wild to think this is her first feature film in five years, not to mention her first drama — the genre she truly excels at — in nearly a decade. She adapts Isabel Wilkerson’s monumental nonfiction study Caste as a cross between a historical mystery and a memoir, making the writer (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) her protagonist. Thus, we see the personal tragedies Wilkerson dealt with during her research, which adds an emotional urgency to her journey. But the film’s real power lies in Duvernay’s ability to jump across historical events, anecdotes, and images, forging connections that are at times revelatory and devastating, creating something that at times feels like both essay film and melodrama. Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s films were never not ambitious, but they’ve become even more so over the years, all the while remaining confined to the rural Turkish small towns whose lives the director chronicles so well. His latest, clocking in at a mesmerizing 197 minutes, follows a middle school teacher (Deniz Celiloglu) whose attitude toward the people around him — be they students, fellow teachers, or ordinary citizens — is alternately patronizing, compassionate, and contemptuous. Not unlike with Passages, at times one wonders if this film could have been titled The Worst Person in the World, even as it’s clear that the filmmaker recognizes much of himself in the protagonist. Ceylan has never been a directly political filmmaker, but About Dry Grasses provides an astute analysis of the modern Turkish intellectual’s place in society, in all its infuriating complications, its social paralysis, and self-defeating self-absorption. Wim Wenders released two marvelous films this year (his 3-D documentary Anselm was another triumph, though it just missed my list) and I hope he makes at least a dozen more pictures before he’s through. But in some ways, Perfect Days represents a culmination of the director’s journey. Wenders’s restless, angst-ridden protagonists have always been searching for blissful oblivion. These weren’t ambitious characters but rather people looking for a center. All those road movies — where were they headed? Perfect Days provides a kind of answer. A quiet, middle-aged man lives in a modest Tokyo home, gets up every morning and goes about his day cleaning the city’s toilets. There are hints of a past heartbreak, but they’re nothing more than gentle nods to the fact that all of us come from somewhere. There’s no sense that this person needs to do more, no sense that his life is being wasted. If anything, he is more aware of how lucky he is to be here than any of us. Is this what happiness looks like? Once upon a time, Michael Mann was the king of composed beauty — a director of impeccable frames, of telling postures, of ethereal moods. Over the years, especially as he began to experiment with digital video, his work became more frenetic, more abstract, more reflective of the cacophony of our many-screened visual culture. In Ferrari, a project he’s been trying to realize for several decades, he brings the different sides of his directorial persona together, creating a film that veers between classicism in its domestic scenes and rip-roaring kineticism in its racing scenes. It’s all held together beautifully by Adam Driver as the aging Enzo Ferrari and Penélope Cruz as his wife, Laura, grieving parents and feuding spouses locked in tight emotional combat. Like a warm blanket made of asbestos, Alexander Payne’s comedy-drama about winter break at a boys’ boarding school has a cozy surface familiarity that’s slowly revealed to be toxic. Paul Giamatti — an actor who cannot be compared to any other actor in human history, in any medium — plays a history teacher living resolutely in the past. The stellar Da’Vine Joy Randolph is the grieving head cook who can neither move forward nor look back, and lightning-bolt newcomer Dominic Sessa is a troubled, unloved teen hurtling headlong into an uncertain future. Payne’s fondness for quiet, casual moments blends well with the film’s lo-fi aesthetic, which mimics the textures of a picture from the 1970s. This also means that formally, the movie is fixated on the past the way Giamatti’s character is. Even the nods to the Vietnam War throughout play like coy references to a controversial subject, as they would have been in 1970. Nevertheless, growth is possible. In Payne’s work, one individual’s foibles and failings can open another’s perception; his humans lead not by example, but through their flaws. This is one of the director’s greatest films. So many biopics tried this year not to be biopics, to the point that the films’ publicists politely but firmly requested that we not call them biopics. Christopher Nolan didn’t seem to have any such worries. Oppenheimer is a proud biopic: a dense, big-swing condensation of a 600-page biography about one of the most important men of the 20th century and about (in the movie’s own words) “the most important fucking thing to ever happen in the history of the world.” But Oppenheimer is also the opposite of a standard-issue Great Man movie: The achievement here is monstrous, and the psychic dissolution of the main character before our very eyes is heartbreaking. Nolan wants to enter J. Robert Oppenheimer’s mind, to see the “hidden universe” that quantum physics opened up and thus convey the psychic prison in which the scientist found himself after ushering in the nuclear age. That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages. All of horror’s liveliest developments bubbled up from the genre’s raw edges this year — and, more than anything, from the internet. A24’s hit Talk to Me was the product of two Australian YouTubers, while Kyle Edward Ball’s Skinamarink was born out of creepy-pasta tropes and liminal spaces videos. But it’s another debut, Robbie Banfitch’s found-footage Mojave Desert freakout The Outwaters, that’s stubbornly stuck with me for months, and I only heard about it because of how much it polarized horror fans online. Made for a reported $15,000, and heavily improvised, The Outwaters sounds Blair Witch–like on paper, down to the camping trip its group of four friends is taking. But the actual experience of watching it is an astonishing array of dreamlike imagery as the trip goes from mundane to macabre. A stranger’s bloody limbs glimpsed by flashlight at night give way to sights that are even more disturbing in the harsh daylight, and Banfitch, who also stars in the film, appears at different times to be a victim of whatever’s happening and one of its perpetrators. He may not be working with much by way of resources, but what he accomplishes in this borderline experimental movie knocked my socks off — never more so than the moment when his protagonist somehow finds himself on the wing of a plane like the one he takes home at the start of the film, as though he’s always been caught in this nightmare and only now sees it. James Gunn has headed off to the unenviable job of getting another superhero house in order at a corporation that’s willing to etherize even his own movie for tax purposes. But before he did, he demonstrated that he’s the best thing that ever happened to the MCU — not that I really needed the reminder as someone who’s always been hugely susceptible to his signature mix of the profane, the brutal, the sentimental, and the unexpectedly sublime. The decade’s most dominant genre has calcified into not just a formula but an ongoing advertisement for itself that viewers are expected to be grateful to pay for, and in the face of that, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 manages to be more than honest-to-god entertainment, one that has the liberated weirdness of material (like a stealth We3 adaptation) that was never expected to find a mass audiences. It even makes Chris Pratt likable as it brings Star-Lord full circle, from a kid who runs away from grief into the eternal arrested development of a space opera into an adult who finally goes home. Most of the films that were shot during the pandemic retain some essence of the pandemic, whether it has anything to do with what’s onscreen or not. But this 62-minute feature, which is enveloping as the lush night in which it takes place, somehow doesn’t, despite being shot in 2020 after filmmaker Tyler Taormina moved back to his childhood home on Long Island. Happer’s Comet feels, instead, untethered from any particular moment, a dialogue-free tribute to the isolation of suburbia that manages to feel as luxurious as it does lonely. The film skips through space, capturing snapshots rather than trying to assemble anything resembling a story. An older woman takes a break from leafing through a flier to lay her head on her dining room table and smile; a mechanic staffing an auto-body shop with no company except the tinny sound of a radio drops down and starts doing push-ups; a dog sits in a living room watching an off-screen television. Taormina’s images are as undeniably beautiful as they are eerie — the streetlamps and taillights of a parked car glow with equal warmth on an quiet road — but it’s the solitude they exude that makes them so inviting, as though getting a peek into a million private moments. As characters strap on roller skates and go wheeling out into the dark streets, it feels unclear if what’s motivating them is a desire for company or a chance to revel in the indulgence of all those empty spaces. A. V. Rockwell’s first film has the sweep of a novel and the fiercest of spirits, and it’s anchored by a remarkable performance by Teyana Taylor as the resolute Inez de la Paz. Fresh from Rikers in 1994, Inez promptly kidnaps her son, Terry, from a neglectful foster situation in Brooklyn and spirits him uptown to Harlem, where she grew up, and where she’ll eventually link up with an ex, Lucky (William Catlett), in a development that, like most of the ones in the film, doesn’t lead at all where you might expect. A Thousand and One is a gorgeous, moving work about people trying to carve out a family life for themselves with no models to pull from and in the face of a city that becomes increasingly hostile to their existence with every supposed improvement and who fuck up and hurt each other and keep going, because the only other option is to give up. Even while dealing in larger themes, Rockwell always lets her characters lead the way — they are never anything less than vividly alive as they make their way through a teeming metropolis it’s all too easy to disappear into. There’s a formal rigor to playwright Tina Satter’s directorial debut that contrasts starkly with the panicky, pulse-fluttering experience of actually watching it. Satter took her dialogue verbatim from the transcripts of whistleblower Reality Winner’s interrogation by the FBI on June 3, 2017, the day of her arrest, redactions and all — when the film gets to a line that was blacked out, the actors glitch out and briefly vanish from the frame, as though their actual performances had been temporarily excised by the State. And yet there’s nothing removed about Sydney Sweeney’s performance as Reality, which unfolds in micro-expressions as her character tries to pretend — or will herself to believe — that what’s happening to her isn’t such a big deal. As men pour into Reality’s shitty Augusta, Georgia, rental house and start documenting the minutiae of her life, the camera closes in on Sweeney’s increasingly stricken face as though trying to peer into her character’s head. It’s a claustrophobic, masterful work that, in the space of 82 minutes, allows you to witness in intimate detail a young woman’s life getting imploded by the might of the State. Jonathan Glazer’s film portrays a key figure in the Holocaust not as the embodiment of virulent hatred but as a product of compartmentalization and ambition, which turns out to be even more disturbing. I’m not sure there is a viewing experience this year that is simultaneously as stunning and stifling as The Zone of Interest, which subjects you to the bourgeois aspirations and careerist angst of Rudolf (Christian Friedel) and Hedwig Höss (Sandra Hüller), who’ve achieved their dream home right next to the death camp at Auschwitz, which Rudolf oversees. The austerity of Glazer’s approach is unforgiving, presenting the mundanity of the Höss’s concerns, from Hedwig’s pride in her garden to the transfer Rudolf is given that Hedwig refuses to accompany him during, against an always-present-but-never-peered-into backdrop of atrocity. The horror next door only occasionally manages to intrude into carefully partitioned-off consciousnesses of the family, as when a swimming trip with the children is cut short by an encounter with some of the gruesome by-products of the camp. But in a late scene that connects his film to Joshua Oppenheimer’s crucial documentary The Act of Killing, Glazer posits that sometimes the body can revolt against the brutal truths the mind tries to tamp down. Leave it to Hayao Miyazaki to pack so much mourning, self-doubt, resentment, and hope into a movie about a secret kingdom filled with winsome, ravenous anthropomorphic birds. There’s more to The Boy and the Heron than that, of course, including a backdrop of World War II Japan, autobiographical resonances, a pregnant stepmother who’s also an aunt, a gray heron who’s also a grouchy man, and the dream logic of the ocean-dominated otherworld where souls rise up as adorable spirits to be born into our reality. But what’s so compelling about Miyazaki’s epic latest, which will hopefully also not be his last, is the way that the magical serves as an emotional allegory for what 12-year-old Mahito (Soma Santoki) is going through rather than something literal. Mahito’s wizardlike granduncle retreated from reality to create a beguiling but unsteady alternate universe that he needs someone “free of malice” to take over. The Boy and the Heron is about accepting loss but also accepting that you are part of the world, in all its brokenness and all its potential. Lila Avilés’s dazzling family drama takes place over a single day, during which the relatives of a 7-year-old girl named Sol (Naíma Sentíes) gather at her grandfather’s house to throw a surprise birthday party for her father, Tona (Mateo García Elizondo). That Tona is likely to die soon from the cancer that’s reduced him to a husk is clear to everyone except Tótem’s young protagonist, who struggles to understand why her dad doesn’t always want to see her (or anyone) and tries to make sense of the behavior of the grief-stricken grown-ups around her. Avilés’s film combines the avid curiosity of a child with the steady wisdom of an adult, and as it whirls through party prep and the bickering of family members — over a cake, over the bathroom, over Tona’s decision to forgo treatment, over a spiritualist brought in to cleanse the home — it approaches its large ensemble of characters with a tenderness that’s almost unbearable. Without ever verging on cloying, it’s a film about death that becomes a heartfelt celebration of life. Todd Haynes’s latest is a brilliant ode to female toxicity that begins at a place of camp and ends at one that’s closer to horror. The Mary Kay Letourneau–inspired Gracie Atherton-Yoo (Julianne Moore) lisps and bakes and enforces her desired illusion of fairy-tale domesticity by way of a high-femme terrorism that involves weaponized tears and velvet barbs winged at her family members. As Elizabeth Berry, the actor set to play Gracie in an upcoming movie, Natalie Portman is all careful platitudes and hungry eyes, talking a big game about doing justice to the story of how a 36-year-old Gracie seduced the then-13 Joe Yoo (Charles Melton), who she later married, while barely concealing her ravenous glee at the ripeness of the material she’s harvesting. Haynes showcases these dueling characters and the outsize performances behind them with an appreciative wryness that’s deceptive (as Moore opens the fridge, the score lets loose with a dramatic twang before she observes “I don’t think we have enough hot dogs”). It’s Joe who emerges as the film’s wounded soul, played by an impressive Melton as a 30-something man frozen somewhere in adolescence by his experiences, blinking in disbelief at the life he’s found himself in as though just waking up to the reality of what happened to him. It’s a heartbreaking turn, and the way it’s deployed onscreen makes May December the year’s most complex and layered watch. This year has given me a lot of “the old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born” feelings about the movies, between the contraction of the streaming model (which maybe never made sense to begin with in terms of profitability?), the floundering of Disney, the faltering of once-massive franchises, the triumphant labor movements, and the incursion of pop stars into the multiplexes. I’m hardly mourning the corporate structures that have dominated the last decade plus, but I have no idea what comes next. I just know that there’s been no better movie to encapsulate the year, and no better movie, period, than Kelly Reichardt’s matchless Showing Up, which is all about making art in a world that also requires you to make money. As Lizzy, a sculptor and admin assistant at a real arts college that (a little too fittingly) went under a few years ago for financial reasons, Michelle Williams has the perfectly pinched aura of a bluestocking dropped in sun-dappled present-day Portland. But her concerns — her ability to make her delicate clay sculptures of little ladies while also balancing a day job, the enviable self-interest of her frenemy-rival artist-landlord Jo (a delightful Hong Chau) — are palpable enough to feel like they could belong to Reichardt herself, the pressing intertwined with the petty in ways that are deeply relatable. Is it possible to support yourself and still have enough left over to do the work you love? Showing Up, which also features a turn from passion project flautist André Benjamin, doesn’t have an answer. What it does have is an inexpressibly lovely affirmation of the meaning of making art that you believe in, even if it only reaches a select but appreciative audience. Good job, girls. This year saw several major superhero movies go bust (and as of this writing, we don’t know if Aquaman will be another one). It saw Disney deliver one bona fide animated flop (Wish) and another that exists in the liminal space between flop and hit (Elemental). We also saw Netflix starting to pull back on the mountains of money it throws toward film productions. Many of us have been anticipating (maybe even hoping for) the end of the franchise era. But now that it might be happening, what lies on the other side? Throughout 2023, our critics maintained “Best Movies of the Year (So Far)” lists. Some of those selections appear above in our Top 10 picks. Below are more of the films (but not all) that stood out to them this year. Low-budget action master Jessie V. Johnson directed this down-and-dirty period slaughterfest about a woman who becomes a powerful warrior after her husband, the leader of the Iceni, is killed by the Romans. As the title character, a legendary figure in ancient British history, the great Olga Kurylenko convincingly goes from meek, tender, and deferential to mad, snarling, and murderous. Don’t expect much historical analysis or period accuracy or emotional nuance; this one works on your lizard brain. It’s like a dimestore Braveheart: It might not have the sweep of those old-school period action films, but it’s still thrilling and passionate and filled with bloodcurdling, wall-to-wall violence. —B.E. Kaouther Ben Hania’s hybrid documentary has a remarkable conceit, telling the story of Olfa Hamrouni, a Tunisian mother, and her four daughters by restaging scenes from their eventful, terrifying lives. Two of the girls play themselves; the other two are played by actresses, because, as Olfa says, they “were devoured by the wolves.” What she actually means by that becomes clear over the course of the film (though Tunisians who remember this news item from recent history may know where the story goes), as we learn about Olfa’s marriage, the abuse in her family, and how her daughters gradually embraced a form of militant, fundamentalist Islam that tore their family apart. An actress is hired to play Olfa during the more difficult scenes, and we see dryly funny and slyly terrifying footage of the real Olfa coaching her double how to act. In telling the story of Olfa and her daughters, Ben Hania (whose 2019 film The Man Who Sold His Skin was nominated for an Oscar) is also telling the tumultuous story of Tunisia in the wake of the Arab Spring, a promising movement that began in that country before spreading to the rest of North Africa and the Middle East. —B.E. It would be tempting to say that Killers of the Flower Moon is Martin Scorsese’s attempt at a western, and one could also see in it yet another gangster epic from a man who’s made his share of them. But in adapting David Grann’s acclaimed 2017 nonfiction history, about a yearslong conspiracy to murder members of the Osage nation in an effort to accrue their oil wealth, Scorsese and screenwriter Eric Roth have turned it into that simplest and slipperiest of things: the story of a marriage. The film is at its best when showing the growing relationship between Mollie Brown (Lily Gladstone), a member of a large and wealthy Osage family, and Ernest Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), a WWI veteran who arrives in town to work for his uncle, William Hale (Robert De Niro), a local godfather type. The most uncomfortable aspect of Killers of the Flower Moon is not the spectacular criminality on display but rather how it’s treated by so many of the characters as no big deal. These are typically Scorsesean ideas: our offhand capacity for evil, the inherent violence of relationships, the strain of serving two masters. In so many ways, though, this is Lily Gladstone’s movie. She plays Mollie with a mix of standoffishness and exhausted hope. As the horrors mount around her, she navigates her queasy, gathering suspicions as well as her affection for her husband. When he tells Mollie he loves her, she believes him. And so do we. That is, in many ways, the great, cruel, unreconciled tragedy at the heart of this tale. —B.E. Argentine director Rodrigo Moreno’s film is being billed as a heist movie, which is not technically incorrect; it is, in fact, about a man who robs a bank and then coaxes a co-worker into an elaborate scheme to get away with it. But at heart, The Delinquents is about leaving an oppressive world behind and discovering the possibility of freedom in a new one. The thieves here are not looking to get rich. “Three and a half years in jail, or 25 at the bank?” is how Morán (Daniel Elias) puts it to his colleague Román (Esteban Bigliardi), explaining why he’s resorted to crime. The plan is quite simple: Morán will confess to the robbery and get three years in prison. Román will hide the money in the meantime. Afterward, the two men will have just enough to not have to work for a living. But is such a goal, such a world, even possible? Moreno’s film is really about the wait in between, about what happens as these two men bide their time. Clocking in at 183 minutes, this is a movie of detours both narrative and formal. But it’s never boring or tedious. The Delinquents works its magic on us the way that the promise of freedom works on its characters. It’s a vision of a life unlived — as impossible as it is intoxicating. —B.E. This brutal Argentine horror film takes place in a reality in which possessions are both known and spreadable, transforming the infected into malevolent, oozing masses of flesh that are referred to as “Rottens.” But what makes Demián Rugna’s film so effective is not the gore (which is appropriately gross!) or the idea of a demonic contagion — it’s the way that the weaknesses of human nature, on both a personal and a systemic level, make stopping the corruption almost impossible once it appears. When a Rotten turns up on land near the farm owned by brothers Pedro (Ezequiel Rodríguez) and Jaime (Demián Salomon), the local authorities pass the buck while insisting that everyone is overreacting. But Pedro, the closest thing the film has to a hero, is anything but. He ends up doing more damage in his flailing efforts to help and to save his children, a sequence that plays like a grim comedy of errors. Rugna was apparently inspired by health issues caused by pesticide in his native country, though the film’s combination of misinformation, denial, and institutional failures invariably brings to mind the early days of COVID. —A.W. The artificial-intelligence framing is just bait — the robots in this sci-fi epic don’t actually have much bearing on our current conversations about ChatGPT. They are, instead, multifaceted metaphors for all sorts of groups that get othered, and the focus of Gareth Edwards’s unexpectedly grown-up movie is less the AIs themselves than how they’re treated by the American forces that are battling to wipe them from existence. The Creator riffs on both Vietnam War movies and Blade Runner as it sends a never-better John David Washington into a war-torn Southeast Asia to look for the woman (Gemma Chan) he loved and betrayed, never seeming sure as to what he would say if he found her. Edwards, always good with visual effects, offers up stunning, lived-in landscapes in which brutalist metal towers coexist alongside paddy fields and villages. —A.W. Documentarian Claire Simon explains what she’s setting out to do at the start of the astonishing Our Body — to explore the “mostly female world” of the women’s health ward of a Parisian hospital, “treating the gynecological pathologies that weigh down on our lives, on our loves, on our hopes, on our desires.” Over the course of her almost three-hour film, she turns her camera to moments of vulnerability, sorrow, and joy as a woman records the voice of her crying newborn after giving birth alone, as a trans teenager learns he’ll have to wait until he’s 18 to go ahead with medical procedures his father refuses to consent to, and as a young woman weeps while talking about the pain she’s started experiencing during sex with her new husband. There’s an expansive generosity to the film, and to the willingness of its subjects to allow these moments to be documented, that’s met with the same openness from Simon when a diagnosis means that she’s no longer just the director but a patient herself. —A.W. Sebastien Marnier’s slow-boiling thriller weaves such a mood of sinister duplicity that you might want to take a shower afterward. It follows Stephane (Laure Calamy), a cannery worker with a girlfriend in prison, who reconnects with Serge (Jacques Weber), the wealthy businessman she claims is her father. Serge’s family is immediately suspicious, but it’s clear they’ve got their own designs on the man’s wealth. Everybody in this movie seems to be lying through their teeth. In less sure hands, this could have resulted in annoyance. But Marnier and his terrific cast know just how much to reveal and when. They keep us delightfully unmoored. —B.E. Kenneth Branagh’s Hercule Poirot mysteries haven’t exactly set the film world on fire, so the fact that the director-star continues to make them clearly speaks to his love for these stories and this character. In the latest, A Haunting in Venice, he forsakes the swooping cameras and epic vistas and frantic pacing of the previous films for something stranger, more insular, and maybe even more refined. He takes Agatha Christie’s little-discussed 1969 novel, Hallowe’en Party, and turns it into a moody, staccato thriller about the unknown. He also takes quite a few liberties with the original along the way, transporting the story to Venice in 1947 and bringing in a supernatural undercurrent. This allows for some jump-scares, but it also makes Poirot more intriguing: His refusal to believe in matters of the spirit isn’t just due to his devotion to science and reason — it’s also a measure of his brokenness. —B.E. Pablo Larraín’s latest film presents General Augusto Pinochet, the brutal, U.S.-backed military dictator who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990 and died in 2006, still with the blood of thousands on his hands, as a literal vampire. So, what is it? Horror? Satire? Allegory? Political thriller? Family drama? It’s got all these elements in it, but it’s also very much its own thing — an elegantly shot film whose competing tones create something delirious and new. But beneath all the genre theatrics, what comes through most vividly in El Conde are Larraín’s sadness and rage at what happened to his country. —B.E. If anything, Emma Seligman’s follow-up to Shiva Baby could be even more anarchic, but as is, it’s a blissfully silly, unabashedly violent, and often daring time. Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri are a comedy duo for the ages as PJ and Josie, lesbian outcasts who found a women’s self-defense class/fight club at their high school and accidentally create a space for feminist solidarity, though the two of them are just trying to get laid. Both are very funny, and the cast features other standouts too — like Marshawn Lynch as the club’s soon-to-be-divorced adviser and Kaia Gerber as the school’s second-most-popular cheerleader. —A.W. In Rodrigo Sorogoyen’s absorbing, suspenseful drama, a French couple attempt to start an organic farm and rehabilitate a desolate stretch of property in a rural Spanish village. But the locals, who are trying to sell their land off for development by a wind-energy company, see the couple as stuck-up foreigners trying to prevent them from making money and leaving this place. Sorogoyen might give lip service to the economic realities underlying the land dispute, but he’s also not afraid to take sides and to entertain. As the growing hostility between the man and woman and their neighbors eventually reaches Straw Dogs–esque proportions, it becomes clear the director wants to make us feel his protagonists’ growing helplessness and the gnawing tension of living right next door to people who might genuinely want to kill you. —B.E. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig, Barbie has become a Rorschach-inkblot purity test about feminism, womanhood, and the state of the industry itself. Is Barbie feminist or is it merely a marker of capitalism’s cunning, taking the emblems but not of the soul of the feminist movement? Is it just a slick toy commercial or is it actually reckoning with the cultural weight of Barbie with wit? I think the truth is rather complex, making Barbie operate as a woman’s picture, a feminist argument, and film defined by its delirious interest in the pleasure principle. No matter where you’ve drawn your lines on this cultural battlefield, it’s hard to deny that Barbie is fun as hell. Led by star-producer Margot Robbie, Barbie is a pink funhouse brimming with glittering dance numbers, heartfelt monologues, and a genuine curiosity about not just womanhood but humanity itself. Everyone in the cast brings their A-game. Ryan Gosling undoubtedly has the boldest performance as the yearning himbo Ken, whose entire existence is in service of basking in Barbie’s warm gaze. Issa Rae and Hari Nef are equal delights for some deranged line readings alone. America Ferrera is the stealth MVP for her juicy monologue that extols the constrictions on women. Robbie cements her position as a true new star in Hollywood’s firmament by helping craft a film that has a capacious curiosity and joyful aesthetics that speak toward the wild, yearning nature of being alive. —A.J.B. Juel Taylor’s genre-bending directorial debut is a vibrant, snappy melding of sci-fi concepts, social commentary, and blaxploitation homage with John Boyega, Jamie Foxx, and Teyonah Parris starring as broadly drawn types — a drug dealer, a pimp, and a sex worker — who discover that the seemingly inescapable patterns of their lives in a neighborhood called the Glen aren’t accidental and are actually the result of a government conspiracy. With so many Netflix original movies these days feeling like algorithmic filler, They Cloned Tyrone is the rare offering that doesn’t just feel like it’s made by a person but by someone with an eye for visual, a distinctive voice, and a sharp sense of humor. —A.W. Forest fires rage in the distance in Christian Petzold’s entrancing film, which doesn’t stop its characters — novelist Leon (Thomas Schubert), photographer Felix (Langston Uibel), seasonal worker Nadja (Paula Beer), and rescue swimmer Devid (Enno Trebs) — from flirting and fighting over shared meals outside the beach house that’s Afire’s primary setting. Throughout the film, it’s Leon’s tetchiness over the failings of his second manuscript that threaten to derail the seaside idyll, but the potential for more serious danger always lurks in the background. The wonder of Petzold’s work is that it revels in the unblemished youthfulness of its characters while allowing that, in order to make great art, it helps to have endured some pain. —A.W. Free-diving — trying to reach record depths by simply holding your breath and diving as far as you can — is one of the deadliest sports on the face of the Earth, and Laura McGann’s documentary has quite a challenge: How to tell its story without feeling like it’s exploiting a potential tragedy. The film opens with champion Italian diver Alessia Zecchini blacking out at the end of one of her dives, then flashes back across the years to show her love for the sport and her rise to the top, all the while interweaving the story of Stephen Keenan, an Irish free diver who eventually became an expert safety diver and coach. Those familiar with the story will know where it’s all headed. Others — that would be most viewers, probably — will wonder how these two lives will ultimately intersect. Documentary purists who balk at movies hiding real-life tragedies from their viewers until the end will probably break out in hives. But McGann doesn’t really hide the nature of her story. It’s clear pretty early on that we’re watching something harrowing. This is, ultimately, an elegant and deeply moving picture. —B.E. The latest Mission: Impossible movie, as suggested by that ominous “part one,” seems to care a bit more about its plot than previous entries, and it’s not hard to see why. This time, Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt isn’t fighting nihilistic terrorists or vaporous international-espionage networks but an all-powerful artificial intelligence known as “the Entity,” a variation on the man-versus-machine theme that Cruise pursued in last year’s Top Gun: Maverick. It’s also a rather compelling metaphor for the actor’s well-publicized dedication to old-school action filmmaking and real-life stunt work. But if Dead Reckoning spends a bit too much time slowly (and repeatedly) spelling out what the Entity is and what it can do and why that’s capital-B Bad, it can be forgiven, because all that exposition serves as a kind of spiritual justification for the bravado on display. And the film is filled with amazing action set pieces, including the star’s much-publicized death-defying motorcycle-parachute jump over — or rather into — an immense Norwegian canyon as well as the most hair-raising train derailment ever put to film. Whenever it gets down to the business of making Tom Cruise run and jump and drive and fly in and out of things, Dead Reckoning manages to astonish. —B.E. Read Bilge Ebiri’s full review of Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One and Jason Bailey’s ranking of the best action sequences in the entire M:I franchise. Despite the spectacle of an effectively de-aged Harrison Ford walloping Nazis atop a train during World War II in its opening scenes, James Mangold’s film isn’t about the young Indiana Jones but about the aging and rather pathetic Dr. Henry Jones, now on the verge of retirement from teaching archaeology to sleepy Hunter College students, drinking himself silly in a grubby New York apartment. Into his life enters his goddaughter, Helena Shaw (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), the adventurous offspring of an old colleague, to drag him along on a chase for a contraption that can predict fissures in the very fabric of time, thereby allowing travel into the past. Not unlike The Force Awakens did with the original Star Wars, Dial of Destiny feels at times like a remix, offering variations on elements from earlier Indiana Jones movies. Mangold may not have the young Steven Spielberg’s musical flair for extravagant action choreography (who does?), but he is a tougher, leaner director, using a tighter frame and keeping his camera close. That may shortchange the escapist atmosphere and evocative exotica of the material, but it does bring a ground-level immediacy to the action. Plus all the vehicular mayhem probably suits this older, slower version of Indy, who fights less but often finds himself in the middle of any number of “wouldn’t it be cool if” chases: motorcycles and tuk-tuks and trains and Jaguars and horses and planes in all manner of arrangements and rearrangements as well as one delirious final sequence that had me giggling with delight. No, it’s not Raiders of the Lost Ark; no movie is. But it’s too entertaining to dismiss. —B.E. Pietro Marcello’s previous feature, 2020’s brilliant Martin Eden, was an ambitious adaptation that attempted to graft a Jack London novel onto the entire history of the 20th century. With Scarlet, he works in a gentler register, though the ambition is still there. In its opening scenes, a gruff, quiet man, Raphaël (Raphaël Thiéry), returns from World War I to discover that his wife is dead and that he has a young daughter. He and the girl live with a group of women who are outcasts from the community, and he soon becomes an outcast as well. This rough man’s daughter (played as a young woman by Juliette Jouan) turns out to be the most delicate of creatures, a romantic young woman with a connection to the divine. This beguiling film has the cadences of a fairy tale — prophetic visions, magical coincidences, behavior echoed across the years — but Marcello, who came up through the documentary world, expertly blends the immediate and the airy. —B.E. Georgia Oakley’s feature debut is an anguished look at life in the closet set in Northeast England in 1988 — the year the Thatcher administration introduced a set of laws banning the “promotion of homosexuality” in the name of protecting children. Jean, played by a terrific Rosy McEwen in her first leading role, has painstakingly compartmentalized her existence. At night, she hangs out at a lesbian bar with her girlfriend, Viv (Kerrie Hayes), a part of herself she keeps secret from her co-workers and students at the school where she works as a gym teacher in the day. Blue Jean is a moody, delicately wrought film about how Jean, damaged from past experiences and her own internalized homophobia, is unable to feel like she belongs in either of the worlds she created for herself. The justification for the impending legislation in the background of the film may sound all too familiar, but Blue Jean’s real power comes from its examination of the human costs of living in fear. —A.W. Not to be corny, but I teared up a few times during the opening scenes of this sequel to 2018’s Into the Spider-Verse just from how good it all looked. Somehow, the animation is even more impressive and imaginative, as the film gives us new universes done in soft watercolors and futuristic detail while also returning us to the embrace of the vibrant, comic-book-art–inspired Brooklyn that its teenage hero, Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), inhabits. Across the Spider-Verse ends on a to-be-continued, but it’s hard to complain about that when it’s so rich with detail and so beautifully crafted — a riff on multiverse storytelling that also becomes a heartfelt exploration of parenting and accepting that growing up means that your child is going to encounter pain you can’t shelter them from. —A.W. Based on a real-life case, Dominik Moll’s thriller follows the lengthy investigation into the grisly burning death of a young woman in a small town near Grenoble. An opening title informs us that this was but one of many unsolved murders in France, a disquieting bit of information with which to kick off a mystery, telling us there won’t be a final solution to the case. This subtly draws our attention to other aspects of the story: to the interactions among the cops investigating the case, to the humdrum bureaucracy of police work, and to a general feeling of haunted desolation in this provincial area nestled next to the French Alps. The film won six awards at this year’s César Awards, including Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, but there seems to be very little buzz around its U.S. release. Even so, it feels major, with an unsettling mood that recalls such previous policier masterpieces as David Fincher’s Zodiac and Bong Joon Ho’s Memories of Murder. Its real-world mysteries eventually become existential ones, but the movie never stops sending chills up your spine. —B.E. As the ultracorporate “shark” Jim Balsillie, Glenn Howerton is a near-comical vision of drive and animalistic ambition, and his character turns out to be just who the clumsy, introverted nerds who founded Research in Motion (RIM), the tiny company that would transform the cell-phone industry, need to make their harebrained schemes reality. Directed by Matt Johnson, BlackBerry basically presents the rise of the smartphone as a sitcom pitch: What happens when two affable, not-ready-for-prime-time dorks from Waterloo, Canada — brilliant engineer Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel) and his can-do cheerleader pal Doug Fregin (Johnson) — are joined by a crisply suited, Harvard-educated, phone-smashing apex predator. One of the great pleasures of BlackBerry is watching Balsillie’s befuddled, running disgust at Lazaridis and Fregin’s hapless ways, at the chaotic ineptitude of their finances, their utter lack of business sense, and their go-along-to-get-along management style. I would happily watch several seasons of these three going at it. —B.E. This is a largely wordless World War II thriller about a grizzled, haunted loner who strikes a massive vein of gold in the remote reaches of Lapland, only to find himself tormented by a platoon of retreating Nazis. The year is 1944, and the war is basically lost for the Germans, who are laying waste to everything in their path. As the Nazis chase him, our hero picks them off, sometimes individually and sometimes en masse. What keeps it from being repetitive and predictable is director Jalmari Helander’s increasingly creative ideas about how his hero should go about wasting the Nazis in his path, as the film graduates from humble head stabbings and limb snappings to more ambitious and explosive mayhem. So much so that it all starts to border on a philosophical treatise about survival and perseverance. Some will say Sisu recalls Mad Max: Fury Road or Inglourious Basterds, but I kept imagining it as what might have happened had Sergio Leone been alive to direct Crank: High Voltage. —B.E. Like the characters in Brokeback Mountain, the men in this drama from Felix van Groeningen and Charlotte Vandermeersch bond during an Edenic summer in the wilderness, and while their relationship is platonic, the film is no less a love story. Pietro (Luca Marinelli) and Bruno (Alessandro Borghi) are childhood friends who reunite as adults to build a cabin up in the mountains where Bruno grew up and Pietro’s family used to spend the summers — a breathtaking location that becomes a place the two return to as the years pass. The Eight Mountains offers all sorts of ecstatically beautiful footage of the Italian Alps, but it also spins out a delicate, rueful story about trying to find a balance between nature and work, as its two characters take divergent routes in their search for a meaningful life. —A.W. The comedy troupe Broken Lizard met at Colgate back in 1989 and never spiritually left college. Thank God for that. Their work still feels like a group of amiable stoners from across the hall came up with a bunch of dumb, funny ideas to put into a movie and then filmed it all the following morning. A riff on The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Quasi may be their first period piece, but it’s basically the same vibes-based silliness. Steve Lemme plays Quasimodo, a torture-chamber employee who gets caught in a petty but murderous tiff between the pope and the king. One can easily imagine a version of this movie where the plot is handled with urgency, authenticity, and suspense, but then what would you be left with? The Broken Lizard guys understand that their brand of handmade, good-natured humor doesn’t really work with tighter storytelling or sharper acting, and they’ve honed their approach well over the years. They’re always winking at us because they know theirs is a fundamentally participatory style of comedy; the process is part of the joke. They keep making cult movies so that when you watch them, you feel as if you were there when they made them. Broken Lizard is all of us. —B.E. Makoto Shinkai’s latest is another of the openhearted romantic fantasies he’s so good at, a road-trip adventure about an orphaned teenage girl who helps save Japan from a mythical worm whose intrusions into our world cause massive earthquakes. But despite featuring both a mysterious love interest and a talking cat, Suzume is a more pensive affair than it first appears, one that reflects what it means to come of age when the future feels so uncertain. Suzume (Nanoka Hara) and her companion, Souta (Hokuto Matsumura) — a dreamboat who, hilariously, spends most of his time magically transformed into a three-legged chair — cross the country trying to close up portals that open in areas that have been abandoned because of disasters or the shrinking population, as though patching up the tears in a social fabric that’s wearing thin all over. It’s a swoony, gorgeously animated movie that earns its sadness as well as its ecstatic bursts of hope. —A.W. It’s possible that no scene this year will be more entertaining than the one in which Signe (Kristine Kujath Thorp), a Norwegian woman with a pathological need to be the center of attention, lies to the chef at a fancy dinner about having severe nut allergies, then forgets she said that and eats something with nuts while the whole table looks on in horrified expectation. But then, all of this Kristoffer Borgli movie is like that — a bitterly funny black comedy about narcissism and the paths people attempt to take to fame. When Signe’s boyfriend, Thomas (Eirik Sæther), rises thanks to a dubious artistic career involving stolen furniture, Signe retaliates by taking a recalled Russian drug whose side effects include a horrifying skin condition. The perfectly paired sociopaths ricochet through Oslo as though each is involved in their own elaborate stunt that never actually ends. —A.W. Air, Ben Affleck’s enormously entertaining corporate drama about Nike’s efforts to sign Michael Jordan, might seem at first like a ridiculous idea for a movie, but it is in fact an ingenious one. The creation of the Air Jordan sneaker changed pop culture forever, and Jordan’s unprecedented profit-sharing deal with Nike would give athletes equity in the products they were being used to sell. The film situates the Air Jordan as a product of the runaway consumerism of the 1980s, but it also hints at a boundless, complex new world coming into view. In what will surely go down in history as one of the great sports-movie speeches, Sonny Vaccaro (Matt Damon), the executive in charge of the shoe company’s basketball outreach, makes the point to Michael himself that the player practically exists outside of space and time. “Everyone at this table will be forgotten,” he says, noting all the executives gathered around them. “Except for you.” —B.E. In attempting to turn the classic fantasy role-playing game into a franchise picture, directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein somehow manage to play to the base while acknowledging the inherent ridiculousness and impenetrability of the concept. Their film is filled with medieval derring-do, unpronounceable fantasyspeak, and what I can only assume is a cornucopia of nerdtastic Easter eggs. But it’s also hilarious, with a game cast led by Chris Pine, a leading man who has turned making fun of his own leading manness into an art form. The film’s set pieces are built around comedy, with bits of (cleverly choreographed and directed) action to add some urgency, not the other way around. And the humor actually helps to up the suspense. Honor Among Thieves is the work of filmmakers who understand that the best way to take stuff like this seriously is not to take it seriously at all, and to have fun with it. —B.E. John Wick: Chapter 4 is blissfully entertaining, full of pratfalls and acting turns that make audiences swell with oohs, aahs, and yelps. It’s far more narratively focused than its previous sequels, while still managing to globe-trot a behemoth cast à la Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Here, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) seeks to finally buy his freedom by dueling the Marquis (Bill Skarsgård). I have some reservations about the narrative choices, but the cinematic violence of Chapter 4 brought me the joy and erotic rush that has long powered the series. It synthesizes the zaniness of Looney Tunes and gags of Buster Keaton with martial-arts master classes that call back to the career of Jackie Chan and learn from more recent films like 2017’s South Korean action flick The Villainess. It’s a history lesson on what the body can do onscreen — its limits and its wonders. —A.J.B. Read Angelica Jade Bastién’s review of John Wick: Chapter 4, Chris Lee’s interview with filmmaker Chad Stahelski, and Bilge Ebiri’s analysis of the movie’s ending. This is the lightly fictionalized (and amazing) story of amateur historian Philippa Langley (Sally Hawkins), who in 2012 helped lead an archaeological expedition that dug up a nondescript Leicester car park and unearthed the remains of the notorious King Richard III. The bulk of the film tells of how Philippa came to be fascinated by the disgraced medieval monarch and fought not just to find his grave but also to counter the prevailing villainous narrative about him, which may well have been the work of Tudor propagandists. There’s an interesting tension in the film, between the exaltation of royal power on the one hand — a spiritual belief in the magic of lineage, itself dating back to arcane notions of divine right — and, on the other, the ennobling of common individuals, of ordinary people like Philippa as they butt heads with city councils and university administrators and academic mossbacks. The very act of reclaiming Richard’s legacy from his now-gone Tudor rivals puts the lie to the very idea of royalty, of bloodlines, and the eternal question of who gets to have power over whom. —B.E. The latest from award-winning, veteran Belgian realists Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne follows two African migrants in Belgium: 17-year-old Lokita (Joely Mbundu) and her 11-year-old “brother,” Tori (Pablo Schils). They’re not actually siblings. They’re not even from the same country. But they’ve formed an almost mystically strong bond ever since they met during their crossing to Europe and have now become inseparable. For all the sensitivity and sobriety of their work, what has made the Dardennes such effective filmmakers has been the subtle way they insert genre elements into their dramas. Each movie could be thought of as a thriller — often involving characters racing against the clock, entering places they mustn’t, or crossing people they shouldn’t. This one is no different: Tori and Lokita work for pennies at an Italian restaurant, singing songs for the customers, then dealing drugs all over the city for the joint’s owner so they can make money to send to Lokita’s family back home and to the smugglers that brought them here. These two kids are surrounded by cruelty, indifference, and suspicion, but their relationship also allows us to feel some hope. It also means that the film becomes ulcer-inducingly unbearable once things truly start to spin out of control. —B.E. This cleverly constructed comedy from Hong Sang-soo takes place entirely in a small Seoul apartment building that provides not just the setting for the movie, but its structure. Byung-soo (Hae-hyo Kwon) is an acclaimed filmmaker paying a visit to the building’s owner, an old friend named Ms. Kim (Lee Hye-young) who soon realizes he has ulterior motives. But what follows are sly episodes that take Byung-soo to each level of the building in what can be seen as glimpses of his future romantic and professional disappointments, or as forward-looking fantasies about his life as he gradually loses the status that’s key to his identity. —A.W. The romantic comedy isn’t dead, it’s strolling around South London in the company of Dom (David Jonsson) and Yas (Vivian Oparah), a pair of charming 20-somethings who end up spending the day together after a less than auspicious meet cute in the bathroom of an art gallery. Both are getting over breakups, and the joy of Raine Allen-Miller’s movie comes from the dawning realization in each, over teasing banter and some mini-adventures along the way, that they might finally be ready to open their hearts again. —A.W. Ji Huang and Ryûji Otsuka’s bleakly funny film has you aching for its 20-year-old protagonist Lynn (Honggui Yao) as much as you also feel exasperated with her naïveté. Lynn, who’s studying to be a flight attendant, seems forever a passenger in her own life, but when she finds out she’s pregnant by her self-involved boyfriend, she opts to keep the baby in a scheme to help her mother, one of the few firm decisions we see her make. In Stonewalling’s vision of a contemporary China accelerating toward dystopia, this shifts Lynn from being commodified for her beauty to being commodified for the fetus she’s carrying, navigating an increasingly absurd fertility industry that suggests her future prospects are bleak. —A.W. Guy Ritchie movies should theoretically be romps, but an overbearing fussiness threatens to kneecap many of them at every turn. Here then is something genuinely charming and light-footed: An espionage comedy-thriller in which a British superspy (Jason Statham) with a fondness for the finer things in life puts together a team to infiltrate the world of a playboy billionaire arms dealer (Hugh Grant), who just happens to be obsessed with the work of an action-movie star (Josh Hartnett), who in turn also gets roped into the elaborate scheme. With plenty of action set pieces — shootouts, car chases, and acrobatic beatdowns — you could imagine this as a dry run for a James Bond film, but the humorous banter and the cast (with especially charming turns from Hartnett and Grant) place it firmly in the realm of comedy. Everybody in Operation Fortune — yes, even Guy Ritchie — seems to be having fun. Sometimes, that’s all you need. —B.E. Cocaine Bear is, above all else, a title and a concept, and the movie clearly understands this. Elizabeth Banks’s action-comedy-thriller is loosely based on a 1985 incident when an American black bear ingested a massive amount of cocaine and was found dead soon thereafter. The film concocts a fanciful story — a series of stories, really — out of what might happen if an enormous bear went on a savage, indestructible, coke-fueled rampage through the Georgia woods. It’s part Spielbergian kids’ adventure, part slasher flick, with an ambling, gory insouciance that might have been more off-putting in a movie not called Cocaine Bear. —B.E. Colin West’s gentle sci-fi comedy-drama plays like Interstellar remade by Wes Anderson. Jim Gaffigan gives a warm, charming performance as the host of a children’s science show who loses his job and decides to build a rocket from the remains of one that has crashed in his backyard. Meanwhile, his rebellious teenage daughter begins falling for the new kid at school, who just happens to be the troubled son of the hard-ass, go-getter astronaut who replaced our hero at his job (also played by Gaffigan, now with a sinister mustache). But as the characters’ realities begin to fray, we start to sense that there’s more to this story than what we’re seeing. It’s a moving film about time, ambition, aging, wormholes, and the all-consuming power of love. And the film’s quaint, handmade qualities help make the tears it remorselessly jerks out of you feel like honest ones. —B.E. Four strangers (led by a wonderful Dave Bautista) emerge from the woods and present a family — a young girl and her two fathers (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) — with an impossible choice: They must willingly sacrifice one member in order to avert the apocalypse. The film smoothly moves from the textures of one type of thriller to another, even as the mood remains eerily consistent. A Frankenstein opening soon gives way to a home-invasion picture, then a village-cult horror movie, and finally a disaster flick. Knock at the Cabin is based on Paul Tremblay’s 2018 novel, The Cabin at the End of the World, and the script follows the book pretty closely for the first two-thirds. Both are works of the apocalyptic imagination, but Tremblay’s tale is more insular, working the ambiguity of the situation to explore the characters’ faith and emotional perseverance. Shyamalan, however, understands that there is usually little ambiguity around such horrors in cinema; in 2023, when someone in a movie says the planet is ending, it usually is. Instead, he returns to one of the animating ideas of his early work: a profound grief at the state of the world. The result is the most exhilarating and wounding film the director has made in many, many years. —B.E. Mia Hansen-Løve makes pictures that amble along with the rhythms of the everyday, about characters who never quite know what to do with themselves when they experience brief moments of happiness. She borrows odds and ends from her own life (and the lives of those around her), and reconfigures them into stories that carry the unnerving echoes of truth. In One Fine Morning, Léa Seydoux plays a widowed single mother whose philosopher father (Pascal Greggory) has been struggling with dementia. While mulling what to do with his rapidly deteriorating condition, Sandra reconnects with an old, married friend (Melvil Poupaud) and begins a heated affair. Suddenly, she finds herself deeply in need of this man’s affections — cherishing her moments with him while trying to hold off the irreparable sadness that seems to surround her. This could have easily become a torrid, tear-jerking melodrama, but Hansen-Løve’s matter-of-fact approach to performance and incident allow the emotions to emerge organically from the unfussy drama onscreen. She reminds us that beauty is often found in the mundane cadences of ordinary life. —B.E. Alice Diop’s stunner of a film tucks a whole fraught universe into a courtroom drama. Kayije Kagame plays Rama, an author and professor who attends the trial of Laurence Coly (Guslagie Malanda), a woman who’s been accused of killing her own baby. Rama intends to make Laurence the subject of her next book, but instead, to her fascination and sporadic horror, sees herself in the admitted murderer, especially in their shared experiences as Senegalese immigrants and receptacles of immense parental expectations. —A.W. With his film Return to Seoul, writer-director Davy Chou grounds his story in Park Ji-min’s features and expressions. Her debut performance is so piercing it makes the entire film move like a breathing poem. Park plays Frédérique “Freddie” Benoît, a 25-year-old Korean woman adopted by a white French couple, who has returned to her ancestral home. When she visits an adoption center to find out more about her parents and realizes the organization must formally send requests to her birth mother and father, Freddie tries to remain impenetrable. But cracks in her charismatic façade become undeniable when she travels to meet her father and the family that could have been hers. There are no grand speeches, no sudden or dramatic upheavals, no twinkling score to mawkishly pull at your heartstrings. Return to Seoul carries itself with a gentle forcefulness. Where do Freddie’s wounds begin? Where does the pain of her torn identity end? It is in the grooves of Park’s beauty, the clarity of her emotion, that we come to understand Freddie’s life as a fable written upon sand. —A.J.B. It may not have won the Oscar, but Colm Bairéad’s 1980s drama about a neglected 9-year-old is a delicate marvel. Filmed entirely in Irish — a first for a Best International Film nominee — The Quiet Girl stars newcomer Catherine Clinch as the vulnerable Cáit, who’s sent away for the summer to live on a farm with distant cousin Eibhlín (Carrie Crowley) and her husband Seán (Andrew Bennett). The couple lost their own child years ago, and the film’s subdued pleasures come from the way the visit makes all three of these wounded people open up, with Cáit, pushed to the margins in her crowded home, blossoming under the attention and care she’s been craving all her life. —A.W.

"Dec 3, 2023"," Now available to rent and buy, both online and on physical media, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is an impressive but flawed biographical picture. While Nolan brings the full weight of his filmmaking talent to bear on the film, it is actually the performances that stand out the most. Oppenheimer uses a non-linear, somewhat messy narrative to follow physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) from his university studies in 1926 Europe, through his masterminding the atomic bomb during World War II, and to its politically fraught aftermath in the 1950s. It tells his story with a large ensemble cast; it would be a nightmare remembering every character’s name, but thankfully Nolan’s screenplay ensures you do not need to remember every famous physicist in order to follow the story. What does make things needlessly complicated is Nolan’s constant shifting back and fourth between three separate timelines. While the bulk of the film follows Oppenheimer’s career during the war, another presents a rather harrowing interrogation of Oppenheimer in the 1950s. A third, presented in stark black and white (a first for the Imax film format), follows a Senate confirmation for Cabinet hopeful Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). The use of black and white is a bold but distracting choice, and a lack of clarity in the film’s initial scenes makes it a slightly muddled ride for the first 45 minutes or so. When the action settles down, the narrative becomes clearer, and there is certainly a strong emotional payoff by the climax. No matter the thread or timeline, Oppenheimer is a film haunted by the spectre of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer himself is increasingly haunted by the potential for destruction and abstract imagery peppers the most intense scenes with glimpses of atoms splitting and fire raging. So pervasive is the sense of dread that it powerfully undercuts any sense of achievement. When the iconic Trinity test succeeds, the gathered scientists and soldiers clap and cheer enthusiastically, yet the scene retains the miserable gut-punch of tragedy. It’s not a surprise to note Nolan is 53 years old: Oppenheimer‘s treatment of the atomic bomb blazes with “generation x” expectations of nuclear annihilations. Nowadays our expectations of Armageddon feel more closely tied to climate change or viral outbreaks. If you were not there in the early 1980s, you simply do not know what it felt like: Nolan captures it perfectly. It is great to see Cillian Murphy not only get his highest-profile lead role to date, but to see him play it with such complexity. There is an ambivalence to Murphy’s gaze, and he employs it powerfully here. He is surrounded by a broad ensemble of hugely talented artists, including Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Florence Pugh, and David Dastmalchian. Among them there are three key highlights: it is wonderful to see Robert Downey Jr fully stretch his acting talents as Strauss, a role miles away from the Iron Man films that dominated much of the past 15 years. Another unexpectedly strong performance comes from Jason Clarke (Terminator: Genisys, Pet Sematary), who captures the screen as an aggressive government prosecutor. Finally Emily Blunt does wonders in a somewhat limited role as Oppenheimer’s resentful wife Kitty. It is hard not to notice how much Oppenheimer limits and sidelines its female characters. It is partly a problem of history: make a film about a group of men building an atomic bomb and it is going to be dominated by male characters. On the other hand, including Kitty Oppenheimer opens the film to a woman’s perspective on the historical events. Nolan entertains the potential to some degree, but could easily have pushed much further. The situation is even worse for co-star Florence Pugh, who plays J. Robert’s lover Jean Tatlock – she appears terribly superficial in a role that wastes her talents. Christopher Nolan continues to have a blind spot for women in his films. All too often they are underwritten. They exist as either victims (Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight), damsels (Kat Barton in Tenet), or as emotional support for the male protagonist (Ellie Burr in Insomnia, Sarah Borden in The Prestige). I am sure many would argue that the facts of history precluded Nolan from foregrounding any women here; this ignores the fact that he gives himself the perfect set-up already – and simply fails to follow through with it. Despite its flaws, Oppenheimer is a powerful, visually impressive film. Ludwig Göransson’s musical score is masterful, as is Nolan’s use of sound. Stamping feet never felt so powerful, or so ominous.",POSITIVE
"Dec 3, 2023"," In typical Christopher Nolan (Dunkirk, Inception) style, Oppenheimer fizzes with quick cuts, multiple timelines, and aesthetic flourishes accompanied by immersive sound effects. But just because there’s a lot happening on screen, with a tense soundtrack playing for three hours straight, it doesn’t mean a movie will be interesting.  The film suffers from a lack of editing, and the topic about the excesses of hubris feels like deeply trodden territory. Aside from an impressive showcase for Cillian Murphy as the titular physicist and “father of the atom bomb,” Oppenheimer amounts to more the same navel-gazing found in Nolan’s previous film, Tenet (2020)—more flash than substance. Nolan does women dirty in Oppenheimer. Florence Pugh plays Oppenheimer’s mistress, Jean Tatlock, and spends much of her screen time naked and hypersexualized before she kills herself so that the narrative can give the physicist a scene where he gets to feel bad. Emily Blunt gets shoved into a tokenized box as a shrew-like wife, shown mostly crying, yelling, throwing things, and/or all of the above. Although she gets a single “grrl power” scene, dressing down a table full of men, it’s overall a demeaning role for an actor who’s so much more than this script allows her to be. I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities—Japanese people and Native Americans—were glossed over by the script and had no voice. At most, white characters quip about the “Indians” on whose burial grounds the Manhattan Project blithely bombs to all hell; in other scenes, discussions about Japanese casualties are purposefully cold, taking place behind closed doors in rooms full of white men who discuss the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians like they’re talking about the weather.  The film has Jewish main characters, Robert J. Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), but the story is told by non-Jewish filmmaker Nolan and based on a book by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin—neither of whom are Jewish (though Bird is married to a Jewish woman).  Among lead actors, Downey Jr. has Jewish heritage but Murphy, and the actor who plays iconic Jewish physicist Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) are not. At most, Jewish actors like Alden Ehrenreich, David Krumholtz, Benny Safdie, and others appear in the film, but they play supporting and minor roles in a very large cast. All this to say, there isn’t anything inherently wrong with actors playing roles outside of their own faiths; it just doesn’t make this film a positive example of “Jewish representation,” simply because there isn’t much to speak of.

"Dec 2, 2023"," A movie that might have been otherwise titled 'Fatman: The Dark Knight Rises'  - considering British director Christopher Nolan's claim to fame specializing in comic book superhero blockbusters, the least of dubious celebratory proclamations of the film was plenty of preview studio publicity announcing in effect an industrial light and magic show, bells and whistles galore to behold. Not unlike, ironically, the actual spectator sport on and originally off screen, of Oppenheimer and company's original dress rehearsal detonation in the desert, in goggles and gaping with glee.   A theoretical physicist and director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, a secret installation who mission was to develop and build the first nuclear weapons - and hence often called the 'father of the atomic bomb,' J. Robert Oppenheimer is the subject of the bloated three hour biopic Oppenheimer, currently predicted to grab assorted Oscars this year. While this analysis essentially explores the staggering contradictions of the existence itself of this production - and as a side note a film that saw the entire cast and crew walking out of the London premiere in support of the Hollywood strikes - yet had no effect on the massive publicity extravaganza celebrating the theatrical release. And on the political front, Oppenheimer who seemed to dabble in communism as a hobby, also named names under McCarthyism. Watta guy to memorialize in a movie. Then again, Hollywood would have no qualms about that, destroying so many lives and precipitating suicides under the Blacklist themselves. But at the same time, a film teeming with metaphorical possibilities, whether intentional or not. For instance, early on a scene with Oppenheimer as a student, injecting an apple on his despised science teacher's desk, with a smuggled toxic lab chemical there.  And in that sense, giving rise to theatrical intimations of the biblical Genesis - with Oppenheimer as simultaneously Original sins combo serpent and the first man - in this case banished from the Garden Of Eden whether as creator of the first bomb potentially obliterating humankind, or the destruction of the hope of Eden, hypothetically the rise of socialism back then, a potential utopia he contributed to destroying by naming names - or perhaps both. And speaking of which, a distracting and exhausting focus on the anti-communist McCarthy Hearings, seemingly in excruciating real time for a huge portion of the proceedings that could have benefited enormously from cutting room floor considerations - while somehow giving rise to a dubious new genre, C-Span Cinema. Never has the Red Scare come off as this exceedingly dull.  On the other hand, what would a biopic about a flawed formidable man be, without bad mothers like his wife, the usual historical witch personas, and in this case, femme fatales. In a nutshell, Oppenheimer in the real world visited his old lover on the sly, depicted during much promoted online nude romp scenes, away from his wife. Who in turn left her husband for Oppenheimer, divorcing her spouse after Oppenheimer knocks her up. And, Oppenheimer's bad behavior culminating in lover number one's suicide. But never mind, this movie is presumably all about Oppenheimer's bombs, with bombshells secondary.  And ironically, Oppenheimer himself who relished playing it both ways - basking in the glory of his atomic claim to fame while denouncing the bomb, naming names of presumed political comrades, and concealing his women from one another, - could very likely as an alleged communist have denounced the film released during the Hollywood strikes - while simultaneously basking in the attention the film has bestowed upon him.",NEGATIVE
"Nov 28, 2023"," Oppenheimer (now streaming on Peacock, in addition to VOD services like Amazon Prime Video) is an anomaly: A “prestige”/“auteur-driven” not-a-movie-but-a-Film that was a wild box office success. Christopher Nolan’s inventive bio of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” raked in $950 million worldwide in spite of being a talky three-hour drama that features only one explosion, but hey, that boom is a really, really big one. One wonders if the film would’ve been such a mighty financial success without the “Barbenheimer” phenomenon, which inspired people to flock to theaters for a Barbie/Oppenheimer cognitive-dissonance double-feature – or without the megahyped IMAX 70mm release, which amplified Nolan’s inspired visual presentation, the likes of which lesser directors would probably never consider applying to a historical biopic about a quantum-physics genius. Another component of the anomaly? This mega-big-screen Film works pretty damn well at home on our TVs, too.  The Gist: The first two images we see in Oppenheimer are rain and fire. Appropriately, the third is of Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy), who embodies both. Not too long after this, once Nolan shifts from black and white to color, switches aspect ratios and establishes a few plot strands set in different decades – once Nolan does his Nolan thing, you might say – Oppenheimer sits down a university student to discuss how light functions as both wave and particle. “It’s paradoxical – and yet, it works,” Oppenheimer says, which is also a remarkably pithy, on-point description of the man himself. In the moments between these scenes, we see Oppenheimer as a young man and brilliant student in the mid-1920s; we meet Lewis Strauss in 1959 (Robert Downey Jr.) as he’s on the cusp of his Senate confirmation to President Eisenhower’s cabinet; we watch as Oppenheimer is subject to an antagonistic 1954 hearing over whether his government security clearance should be reinstated; and we see Strauss offer Oppenheimer a job, then get miffed when he believes Oppenheimer spoke poorly of him to Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). Cut into all of this are nearly abstract shots of lights, sparks, flares and stars. Oppenheimer is about to start a fire that no amount of rain will ever put out. These myriad plotlines eventually almost settle down a little as Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) lures Oppenheimer away from his gig teaching quantum physics, and they get to the business of developing the atom bomb. Hitler’s cutting through Europe, and the Allies worry that he’s developing his own weapon of mass destruction; it’s Oppenheimer’s job to beat the Fuhrer to the punch. Groves enables him to build an entire town, dubbed Los Alamos, in the middle of the New Mexico desert where all the scientists and technicians can bring their families and dedicate all their time to the effort. Meanwhile, we flash back to how Oppenheimer met his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), who struggles with depression and alcoholism, as well as how he met Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his mistress (being with two partners at once is applying quantum mechanics to love, you know). The two women share one thing in common: membership in the U.S. Communist Party, and Oppenheimer’s fringe interest in such far-left politics will dog him for decades. To be fair, he seems more like a noncommittal sort when it comes to politics and women, more driven by an intellectual curiosity that rejects binary ideas. Case in point: Is the atomic bomb good or bad? A deterrent or an accelerant? The weapon to end all war or inspire more war? Oppenheimer wrestles with the paradox, but can’t pin it to the mat. All the narratives roll forward: Oppenheimer’s hearing gets heated. Strauss’ confirmation gets heated, too. And as the Los Alamos project progresses, Oppenheimer and co. stare down the likelihood of the bomb creating a chain reaction that’ll set the atmosphere aflame, destroying the entire planet. What are the chances? “Near zero” is the answer, but that’s not zero, and perhaps it goes without saying that everyone would feel a lot better if it was zero; as history dictates, they soldier on anyway. Dozens of characters exchange dialogue with Murphy-as-Oppenheimer, and they’re played by Josh Hartnett, Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, Alden Ehrenreich, Macon Blair, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, Olivia Thirlby and Gary Oldman as Harry Truman. Some of these characters feel the reverberations of that infamous bomb test in the New Mexico desert more than others, but it’s safe to say Oppenheimer felt them the most.  What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: They’re two wildly different artists, I know, but Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City are both piercing and complex explorations of atomic-age existentialism.  Performance Worth Watching: Oldman blatantly steals his only scene; between this and Fair Play, Ehrenreich has reasserted himself after facing some (not entirely deserving!) criticism for Solo: A Star Wars Story; Pugh makes the absolute most of her limited screen time; Murphy is never anything less than fully committed; and is that Josh Hartnett, yes indeed that’s Josh Hartnett! But the performance we’ll carry with us the longest is Downey’s, whose memorably acerbic role as this story’s greasy-politics villain will likely make him an Oscar frontrunner. Our Take: As depicted here, Oppenheimer is not at all a Man of Certainty, which, in the mid-century context, makes him not much of a man at all. Real men are decisive and stick to their guns and double down and never, ever change their minds. You know the type. But those hombres anchor genre movies (Westerns, action flicks) and aren’t the subjects of complicated 180-minute biodramas that build and build and build and build to a nuclear explosion that’s so non-climactic, it’s followed by another entire hour of movie. Not that the kaboom isn’t memorable; it’s intense and awe-inspiring, rattling body and mind with its physicality and implications, and it’s the only thing that shakes Oppenheimer from his habit of being ideologically evasive. Murphy is extraordinary at carrying this man’s multitudes: His take on Oppenheimer is that of a brilliant scientist who’s gifted at inspiring other bright minds to build upon his ideas, a man committed to telling the truth no matter what, and a deeply flawed human being. In Murphy’s performance you sense the struggle within Oppenheimer to tamp down emotions outside of his enthusiasm for pure scientific pursuits, but when politics muddy those pursuits, the emotion swells, cracking his facade. Is he a communist? Yes and no. Does he like being a husband and family man? Yes and no. Does he think the atomic bomb is the granddaddy of all ideological cans of worms? Yes, of course he does, and his attempt to compartmentalize his work in the lab from real-world implications is surely his greatest failure. Believe it or not, Nolan’s storytelling here is crisp and economic, the narrative moving urgently thanks to Jennifer Lame’s brisk editing. Oppenheimer is as propulsive as dialogue-driven habitually time-hopping three-hour character studies get, an uneasy score and on-edge performances generating simmering tension up to and through the big detonation, and the subsequent fallout when Oppenheimer tries to split the hairs of fame and infamy, of guilt and righteousness. Nolan’s loop-de-looping screenplay mirrors the ethical curlicues Oppenheimer navigates throughout, and is packed with dialogue that feels elevated and pragmatic, dozens of sloganeering lines laced with double meanings at the service of a procedural underscored with the terrifying moral dilemmas of the Cold War and struggle existential metaphors involving black holes, dying stars, shattered atoms and things we struggle to comprehend and don’t want to think about. Sure, we might chuckle when Matt Damon all-caps bellows, “THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT F—ING THING IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!” but we can’t argue that it’s not justified. Oppenheimer gives us perhaps the year’s most horrifying sequence when the protagonist gives an unconvincing jingoistic speech to Los Alamos residents, and from his point of view, it’s a surrealistic nightmare, a booze-soaked quasi-religious scene of screaming, crying, laughing rapture. People stomp and clap and chant his name, for he’s the man who ended the war by inventing the bomb that killed hundreds of thousands of people. The chain reaction has started, and it feels like the beginning of the end. It’s the only time we see him speak a lie.  Our Call: STREAM IT. Oppenheimer is an ambitious film (one of the most ambitious ever) about an ambitious project (also one of the most ambitious ever, for better or worse). Nolan blows up the traditional biopic and rebuilds it in thrilling, dynamic fashion.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2023"," J. Robert Oppenheimer was a theoretical Physicist who was the Director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Lab during World War II.  He is also often referred to as the Father of the Atomic Bomb for his work on the project - a fact he often struggled with later in his lifetime. His work, beliefs, and relationships have always been a subject of discussion and this past summer director Christopher Nolan (Tenet) brought a three-hour epic drama to theaters.  Oppenheimer, the second biggest grossing film of the summer behind Barbie, made close to a billion dollars worldwide, is now in stores for purchase on 4K UHD. Cillian Murphy (Red Eye), portrays the scientist with an air of serious conviction.  He is very well cast as he embodies the calm yet determined nature of Oppenheimer. While he isn't physically a match for Oppenheimer he manages well enough for the purposes of this drama. Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), as his wife, Kitty, is a solid choice as she goes through a range of emotions.  Matt Damon (The Martian), who can be hit or miss with his choices of film roles, does a good job as General Leslie Groves, the US Army Corps of Engineers Officer who oversees The Manhattan Project.  Supporting cast members including Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Jason Clarke (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story), Tony Goldwyn (Scandal), Kenneth Branagh (Much Ado About Nothing) and Florence Pugh (Black Widow) give Oppenheimer an added level of credibility as they are all adeptly skilled in the craft of acting. The 2160p video quality is outstanding with details so sharp that one can see the threads on the suits that Murphy and other cast members wear.  The visual effects of ""the explosion"" are perfect and don't look unnatural at all. Every detail offers clean lines and brilliant colors - as much as color can play a role in desert scenes.  The lush hues of California's greenery are deep and true and give the film some depth. The surprise with this release is that the audio is only presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 instead of Dolby Atmos.  While the 5.1 version is top-notch, one can't help but wonder if the quality would not have been enhanced by the latest technology.  Perhaps, the variation was so minute that Universal Pictures felt it was an unnecessary upgrade.  Regardless, the sound, from dialogue to effects and even the score, is stunning.  It doesn't feel as though anything is missing by not presenting the movie in Atmos. Plus Trailers, Innovations in Film: 65mm Black-And-White Film in Oppenheimer, Meet The Press Q&A Panel: Oppenheimer, and To End All War: Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb.  Oppenheimer is arguably one of the best films of the year, and it wouldn't be surprising if it didn't get at least a few Oscar nominations. Whether or not you have already seen it, you will want to add it to your home entertainment collection, and this combo pack is the way to go as it has superior technical quality and a plethora of interesting extras that are worth watching more than once.

"Nov 25, 2023"," THE EQUALIZER 3-MOVIE COLLECTION (2014-2023). Running for four seasons (1985-1989), TV’s The Equalizer found British actor Edward Woodward (The Wicker Man, recently reviewed here) essaying the role of Robert McCall, a former government operative employing his impressive skills to help out those too weak and powerless to fight back. In the same-named film The Equalizer (2014), Robert McCall has been reborn in the personage of Denzel Washington, who similarly brings enormous reserves of brains, brawn, and bravado to the part. Making small talk with another regular customer at his favorite diner, a too-young call girl named Teri (Chloë Grace Moretz), McCall can easily surmise that her vocation isn’t exactly what this Russian immigrant had in mind for herself — that becomes even more clear after she’s brutally beaten by Russian thugs who control her very existence. Realizing he can no longer stand idly by, McCall taps into his long-buried past to help him with this present situation. The Equalizer is about as subtle as a pneumatic stapler shot to the temple, with McCall worthy of sainthood and the villains worthy of being Satan’s emissaries on Earth. But who wants subtlety when one can bask in the glory of Denzel obliterating remorseless degenerates left and right? Like the original (and only decent) entry in Liam Neeson’s Taken series, this isn’t a film for those seeking moral ambiguity or thought-provoking shades of gray. It’s cinema as catharsis, allowing ordinary people weary of living in a world run by vile criminals and corrupt cops the fantasy of seeing a sentient superman righting all wrongs on their behalf. Pimps and other like-minded creeps who prey on women — whether murdering them, torturing them, controlling them (anti-choice, anyone?) or grabbing them by the, ahem — represent just about the worst that humanity has to offer, so when McCall deals with them in violent fashion, progressive viewers just might cheer out loud. As noted, watching Denzel’s former CIA operative deal with all manner of evildoers over the course of The Equalizer is a cathartic experience, but the movie also works because of its kinetic action scenes as well as a gradual reveal of the layers of Washington’s character. The Equalizer 2 (2018) offers no such pleasures. This is a particularly dreary film, one which makes no attempt to freshen up or even disguise its rote storyline. As in many an unimaginative sequel, This Time It’s Personal™, meaning that McCall’s CIA pal Susan (Melissa Leo) gets killed once she gets too close to the truth regarding a faked murder/suicide — that truth is so fleetingly and haphazardly explained that it scarcely matters, and Susan might as well have been slain for trying to steal a neighbor’s cherished pie recipe. A subplot involving McCall’s mentoring relationship with a young kid (Ashton Sanders) seems to have been imported from a lesser ABC Afterschool Special from the 1970s. And while The Equalizer was excessively brutal because the plot demanded it, The Equalizer 2 is excessively brutal because the filmmakers demanded it. It all culminates with a lengthy battle royale in which McCall faces down the baddies while a storm rages all around them. It’s laughably absurd, and just one more reason why The Equalizer 2, despite typically strong work from Washington, is less than the sum of its slickly oiled parts. As heavily reported at the time of its release, The Equalizer 2 was the first sequel Denzel ever made, a mind-blowing fact considering the number of actors only too happy to remain aboard any given gravy train. With The Equalizer 3 (2023), we now get only the second follow-up Denzel has ever made. Clearly, the superstar has great affinity for the character of Robert McCall, and it shows in this picture’s plot. Whereas the heroes in other action flicks find themselves trapped in a neverending series of carbon-copy adventures or only slow down and sleep when they’re dead, McCall is one of the very few who has a legitimate chance at a Happily Ever After retirement from bloodletting. When his latest do-gooder deed takes him to Italy, he ends up recuperating from a particularly nasty injury in a quiet coastal town where everyone seemingly knows everyone else. McCall responds positively to the region and its people, and he considers making the town his permanent home — first, though, he must rid the area of a Mafia-like outfit whose members are into drug-running, murder, and general sneering. With a more focused storyline and a greater emphasis on character, The Equalizer 3 is a definite improvement over the previous picture. It also benefits from the clever casting of Dakota Fanning, here playing acerbic CIA agent Emma Collins. Fanning was all of 10 when she previously co-starred with Washington in 2004’s Man on Fire; she’s now 29, and it’s trippy seeing this former moppet squaring off against Denzel and playing an adult who gives as good as she gets. No points, though, for figuring out how Emma is connected to McCall’s past, as the big reveal turns out to be no big deal with its utter predictability. This new Blu-ray collection is being released alongside standalone editions of The Equalizer 3. The E3 4K and Blu extras include deleted scenes; a look at the reunion between Washington and Fanning; and the lyric video for Jacob Banks’ “Monster.” THE FUGITIVE (1993). Movies based on prime-time television series have long tended to be sorry excuses for cinematic enshrinement (The Dukes of Hazzard, The Beverly Hillbillies, The Honeymooners, about 1,000 more), but The Fugitive remains one of the very best examples of the exception to that rule. Both a critical and commercial smash when it hit theaters 30 years ago, this adaptation of the classic TV show (1963-1967) stars Harrison Ford as Richard Kimble, a Chicago doctor whose wife (Sela Ward) is murdered by a one-armed man for unknown reasons. With no evidence, though, the police finger Kimble as the killer, and he’s quickly arrested, tried, and sentenced to death. But after a spectacular train-and-bus collision sets him free, he searches for the murderer himself — he’s pursued every step of the way by U.S. Marshall Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), who cares far more about catching his man than wondering whether said man is guilty or innocent. Directed for maximum impact by Andrew Davis from a sharp script by Jeb Stuart and David Twohy, this contains enough suspenseful set-pieces, clever red herrings, and spectacular stuntwork to satisfy most thriller aficionados. Yet what really makes the movie work are the performances by the two leads. Ford is believable as the tormented hero — indeed, a key ingredient to the film’s success is how firmly he commands audience sympathy — while Jones is out-and-out terrific as the arrogant, never-say-quit lawman. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this earned Jones the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Extras in the 4K UHD + Digital Code edition consist of audio commentary by Davis and Jones; an introduction by Davis and Ford; a pair of making-of featurettes; a breakdown of the train wreck sequence; and the theatrical trailer. IN LOVE AND WAR (1996). All’s poor in In Love and War, a major miscalculation with two flailing stars under the tutelage of a dull director. Richard Attenborough, a decent actor who began performing in 1942 but only took up directing in 1969, has long maintained a reputation in many (non-BAFTA) circles as a stodgy helmer. While his attention to plodding detail worked quite well for 1982’s Gandhi (his best film, and the one that earned him a Best Director Oscar), it muted other pictures that might have benefitted from a more robust style, such as A Chorus Line and A Bridge Too Far. (Attenborough’s most popular roles included Squadron Leader Bartlett in The Great Escape and John Hammond in Jurassic Park, and we should give thanks that he acted in, rather than directed, those thrill-a-minute classics. But I digress.) The 113-minute In Love and War takes what should have been a moving love story — the fact-based dalliance between a 19-year-old Ernest Hemingway and a 26-year-old nurse — and makes it about as emotionally involving as a 180-minute documentary on aglet production. Chris O’Donnell plays Hemingway as a cocky yet sweet kid whose boundless energy results in a serious leg injury during a World War I skirmish. This places him in the care of Agnes von Kurowsky (Sandra Bullock), and it was the earnest Ernest’s doomed romance with her that arguably transformed him into the macho, womanizing he-man known to all and inarguably informed some of his writing (the character of Catherine Barkley in A Farewell to Arms was based on her). Watching the bland O’Donnell attempt to convey soulful anguish is a sight in itself, while a sluggish Bullock seems distracted throughout, perhaps reflecting on whether it was a mistake to agree to star in the upcoming Speed 2: Cruise Control. (Answer: It was.) OPPENHEIMER (2023). It was quite gratifying to see that both halves of the Barbenheimer phenomenon lived up to the hype, with the social frenzy so ear-piercingly loud that it probably belonged in an IMAX production directed by Christopher Nolan. While Greta Gerwig’s Barbie (recently reviewed here) offers sunshine and rainbow colors to go with its satiric and social themes, Nolan’s Oppenheimer presents a suitably sobering drama that largely hangs under a mushroom cloud of darkly troubling sociopolitical issues. One of the best films of the year thus far, this finds Nolan regular Cillian Murphy moving from supporting player to leading man for the helmer — he delivers a superb performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist whose work on the Manhattan Project led to the creation of the atom bomb. A three-hour motion picture that never wears out its welcome, the film, written and directed by Nolan and adapted from the biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, covers a startling amount of ground, examining not only Oppenheimer’s years on the assignment but also his relationships with his strong-willed wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and his troubled mistress Jean Tatlock (an excellent Florence Pugh), his crippling guilt over the hundreds of thousands killed in Japan toward the close of World War II, and the post-war circumstances that damaged his career. Oppenheimer features an all-star cast, but the picture isn’t merely collecting A-listers as if they were baseball cards — from Matt Damon as the supportive General Groves to Robert Downey Jr. as the shifty Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss, most of the major roles help round out Oppenheimer’s story, and even the smaller parts (tackled by Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, and Gary Oldman, among others) lend import and understanding to the proceedings. Extras in the Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Code edition include a making-of featurette; a Q&A panel chat; and a piece on the atomic bomb. THE POLICE ACADEMY COLLECTION (1984-1994). What, pray tell, might rightly be considered the worst movie franchise (minimum four films) in Hollywood history? While my personal vote would be neatly sliced down the middle with each half given to the Transformers and Friday the 13th series, it’s hard to argue against the folks who would insist it was this inane comedy franchise that dominated much of the 1980s (with one straggler appearing in the ‘90s). That there was a total of seven of these things — not to mention a live-action television series, an animated TV show, a comic book, and even a global theme park attraction — boggles the mind; it would be easy to chalk it up to the ofttimes dubious taste of the American public (see also: Grown Ups, The Apprentice, anything to do with the Kardashians) except that these pictures were even more popular overseas. Police Academy (1984) certainly demonstrated why there was at least one sequel, as the first picture in the series was one of the top 10 grossers of 1984 (thereby rubbing shoulders with genuinely funny flicks like Beverly Hills Cop, Ghostbusters, and Romancing the Stone). A mandate by the mayor states that the metropolitan police department must accept all applicants regardless of age, weight, IQ, etc. Thus we get the usual assemblage of slobs, misfits, and underachievers, including the affable Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg, desperately trying to channel an inner Bill Murray that doesn’t exist), the towering Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), the wacky Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), the gun-crazy Eugene Tackleberry (David Graf), the bold and busty Debbie Callahan (Leslie Easterbrook), the mousy Laverne Hooks (Marion Ramsey), and the bumbling Douglas Fackler (Bruce Mahler). All are under the not-so-watchful eye of the easily befuddled academy head, Commandant Eric Lassard (George Gaynes), with the devious Lieutenant Thaddeus Harris (G.W. Bailey, the poor man’s Herbert Lom/Chief Inspector Dreyfus from The Pink Panther series) serving as a constant foil. The movie isn’t really much funnier than its sorry sequels, but it’s the best of the bunch simply by virtue of being fresh (or as fresh as this moldy premise can get) and by introducing Winslow’s amazing, self-produced sound effects to the general population. Practically every picture in the series showcased a pretty woman to serve as a one-and-done opposite Guttenberg (or his equally blasé replacements in the later entries) — here, it’s Kim Cattrall as the shapely cadet who can’t resist Mahoney’s obnoxious ways. The original Police Academy was the only movie in the series to earn an R rating (for nudity and profanity, natch) — Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment (1985) was PG-13, while the subsequent five flicks all garnered benign PG ratings. This one finds the former cadets (now graduates) assigned to police the most dangerous part of town. Easterbrook is MIA, Bailey has been replaced as the fumbling foil by Art Metrano as Lieutenant Mauser, and Colleen Camp’s Kathleen Kirkland is introduced as a love interest for Tackleberry. But never mind all that: The real story is the arrival of Bobcat Goldthwait to the series, playing a gang leader named Zed McGlunk. Anyone familiar with ‘80s lowbrow humor is familiar with Goldthwait, who typically played twitchy, stuttering goofballs. He’s fascinating to behold, although whether that’s a positive or a negative is up to each individual viewer. At #11, this barely missed out on making the year’s Top 10 grossers list, pushed out by the year-end Chevy Chase-Dan Aykroyd comedy Spies Like Us. Police Academy 3: Back in Training (1986) finds the gang returning to the titular institute to help Lassard prevent its probable closing. Easterbrook reappears (thus reuniting the first picture’s not-so-magnificent seven), Metrano remains, Goldthwait’s Zed is now one of the good guys as a new cadet, and Guttenberg’s plaything this time around is a comely cadet played by 1980 Miss South Carolina / Miss USA / Miss Universe Shawn Weatherly. As in all the other films, the majority of the jokes (whether visual or verbal) don’t even bother with a payoff, which is an odd way to approach comedy. It’s also the only film series in which the characters somehow manage to become even less developed with each passing entry. Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol (1987) is pretty self-explanatory, with the regulars joined in their efforts to rid the city of crime by ordinary citizens recruited to be ersatz cops. Bailey returns as the sneaky Lieutenant Harris, and the supporting cast has more recognizable names than usual: Sharon Stone as Mahoney’s latest conquest, David Spade in his film debut, Randall “Tex” Cobb as a heavy, and an 18-year-old Tony Hawk among the skateboarders making cameo appearances. It’s the same-old same-old, only somehow slightly worse. Police Academy 4 marked Guttenberg’s last series appearance, and with his departure, the filmmakers introduced a boring new vanilla character to replace him in Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach (1988). That would be Lassard’s nephew Nick (Matt McCoy), and this entry’s sweetheart du jour is an officer trained in physical combat (Janet Jones, who became Wayne Gretsky’s wife in the same year she made this). Goldthwait also bailed on the series after PA4, leaving René Auberjonois to attempt to add some semblance of laughs as an excitable jewel thief. One of the series’ worst characters, Harris’ brain-dead assistant Carl Proctor (Lance Kinsey), was introduced back in Part Deux; the filmmakers somehow thought it was a good idea to increase his role with each passing picture, so this one goes all-out with his imbecilic antics. With Police Academy 6: City Under Siege (1989), the series decided to skip bottom-of-the-barrel status and immediately burrow beneath the barrel. This dreadful entry finds the gang unearthing a leak inside their inner circle, one that is allowing a gang of criminals to successfully pull off a series of heists. It’s mildly amusing watching Winslow pretend to be a robot, and, uh, that’s about it for the film’s semi-successful comedy quotient. Extras in the Blu-ray collection include audio commentary on Police Academy by Guttenberg, Winslow, Easterbrook , director Hugh Wilson, and producer Paul Maslansky; film historian audio commentary on Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol; new and archival making-of featurettes; and additional scenes. THE SCARLET LETTER (1934). Given its lofty literary status, it’s perhaps surprising that there haven’t been more film adaptations of Nathaniel Hawthorne’s 1850 novel The Scarlet Letter. The vast majority have been silent films, all largely forgotten save for the 1926 favorite starring Lillian Gish. As for sound versions, there have been three, with the most (in)famous being the 1995 debacle in which Demi Moore was so unconvincing as Hester Prynne that they might as well have cast Roger Moore or Dudley Moore in the part (this was also the one containing the risible scene of Robert Duvall dancing around a campfire with a dead deer balanced on his head). There was a 1973 German take directed by Wim Wenders, and then there’s this 1934 adaptation. The film begins with a written foreword that’s less Hawthorne and more Hollywood Production Code, reading in part, “Though to us, the [Puritan] customs seem grim and the punishments hard, they were a necessity of the times and helped shape the destiny of a nation.” In 17th century Boston, Hester Prynne (Colleen Moore) is forced to wear the letter “A” on her garments for committing adultery and conceiving a child out of wedlock. She refuses to name the father, who turns out to be minister Arthur Dimmesdale (Hardie Albright); meanwhile, Hester’s husband (Henry B. Walthall, who also played the part in the Lillian Gish version) returns after a lengthy absence and is determined to discover the dad’s identity. Often static and burdened with incongruous comic relief, this remains watchable due largely to its relative faithfulness to Hawthorne’s potent source material. Blu-ray extras include audio commentary by professor Jason A. Ney, with contributions by Cora Sue Collins (who played little Pearl in the picture and is still with us at the age of 96); a look at Nathaniel Hawthorne on film; and the trailer from a 1965 re-release. STALAG 17 (1953). It’s easy to see why this World War II yarn from Billy Wilder (who earned a Best Director Oscar nomination for his efforts) was a resounding success upon its release. Different than most of the more baldly jingoistic WWII flicks that had preceded it, it combined hard-biting drama and broad humor in a manner not usually seen in war flicks of the period. Today, the drama survives intact but the humor proves to be a serious drag. Set in a POW camp, the film stars William Holden as Sefton, whose self-serving actions alienate him from the other American soldiers held in the same barracks. When it becomes apparent that there’s a German spy among the POWs in Stalag 17, all suspicion falls on Sefton, who’s forced to out the enemy informant before the other GIs turn vigilante on him. Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his unsentimental turn as the S.O.B. P.O.W., but while he’s typically solid in the role, it’s shocking to note how little screen time he ultimately commands. Instead, Stalag 17 functions as an ensemble piece, which is fine when it focuses on the taut dramatic aspects of the tale but detrimental when it breaks the mood by centering on the slapstick antics of two buffoonish soldiers played by Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck. Strauss’ incessant mugging as Animal inexplicably earned him an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor, yet I suspect his role is even larger than that of top-billed Holden. Extras on the 4K UHD + Blu-ray edition include audio commentary by supporting actors Richard Erdman and Gil Stratton and playwright Donald Bevan (who co-wrote the original stage show on which the film is based); audio commentary by film historian Steve Mitchell and author Steven Jay Rubin (Combat Films: American Realism); a making-of piece; and a look at the real prisoners of Stalag XVII B.",POSITIVE
"Nov 21, 2023"," There are very few directors working today whose new project getting released would be considered a major event. There's the beloved Martin Scorsese, and the ever-popular Quentin Tarantino, but there is perhaps none bigger, or more ambitious, than the great Christopher Nolan. Whether he's giving us a wondrous original creation, or adapting material in only a way that he can, his projects bring with them a grand sense of anticipation that have you excited & eager to see what new visions he'll bring to the screen. For his latest opus, he's chosen to tackle something we've yet to see him do: a biopic. However, this is not just any biopic. It's a portrait of an immensely complicated man who helped to shape the second half of the 20th century, J. Robert Oppenheimer, known to the world as ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb."" ""Oppenheimer"" is told primarily in three different time periods. Chronologically, we have one thread starting in 1926, following Robert (Cillian Murphy) in his early days as he studies at Cambridge, before taking some advice from Dr. Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to continue in Germany instead. He eventually begins teaching at Berkeley, where he is recruited by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) for The Manhattan Project in 1942, a top secret operation to create a nuclear weapon before the Nazis.  Another thread involves a hearing in 1954 regarding Robert's security clearance, which has been questioned due to his past activities with communism. Finally, a third thread in 1959 follows a senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a former colleague of Robert's on the Atomic Energy Commission. Their relationship is closely examined, with certain truths & motivations eventually coming to light. The film cuts back and forth among the three times in an effort to give us some understanding of this very misunderstood individual. As the film opens, you may find yourself a bit disoriented at first as it shifts through and establishes the different threads. It takes a minute to grasp what is happening and when before it settles down to tell you Oppenheimer's story from the beginning. As it does, you may find yourself becoming a little concerned, as I was on my first viewing, that it's moving just a little slow as it explores Robert's early days of studying, his relationship with his eventual wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), his affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and his eventual settling at Berkeley. However, all this is merely a prelude leading up to where the film truly takes off. That, of course, is when Robert is recruited to The Manhattan Project. From here, Nolan fully immerses us in the project, showing us how everything came together, including the recruitment of scientists, the building of Los Alamos, the hard work and determination that went into designing the weapon, the many tests, and the eventual detonation of the real deal. This section, detailing the multitude of complications along the way, is compelling & fascinating on its own, but Nolan wasn't about to stop there. The film also becomes a remarkable dissection of how Oppenheimer dealt with the aftermath, primarily the overwhelming guilt that led him to speak out against the H-bomb, a subsequent project that many people wanted to pursue. And as if that wasn't enough, Nolan goes even further to turn the film into a captivating courtroom drama of sorts as Oppenheimer's character is called into question during his private hearing for his security clearance, a hearing in which his past communist affiliations, opinions, and actions are dredged up and used to viciously attack him. All of this is intertwined with Strauss' confirmation hearing, in which his part in the story is slowly unraveled. Nolan's three-hour epic may start a little slowly, but make no mistake, once it passes the aforementioned prelude, it hits the gas and never lets up. This is one of those projects where you really have to marvel at the cast Nolan was able to assemble. Not only do you have a wonderful turn from Cillian Murphy, who hits every note perfectly with his performance, and Robert Downey Jr. quite possibly delivering the performance of his career, but you also get incredible work from Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Sir Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, Casey Affleck, and more. This is truly an ensemble piece, and every piece here fits just right. This being a Christopher Nolan film, the stunning technical & design work also needs to be mentioned. Every element is handled with perfection, including Jennifer Lame's editing, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography, Ludwig Göransson's score, the visual effects, sound, and production design. This is all on top of Nolan's outstanding direction, which flawlessly brings all of these components together into an unforgettable experience. Finally, Nolan's screenplay, adapted from ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, must have its due. This is a very intricately-written tale that skillfully weaves together three different periods, shifting just when it needs to, revealing details at just the right time, and brilliantly turning this into so much more than just another by-the-numbers biopic. Anyone could have delivered a straightforward film about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, but it takes someone of Nolan's caliber to go beyond that and truly dive into the man to give us a more intimate portrait, one that attempts to convey the immense impact all of these events had on him. With ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan accomplishes that to a dazzling degree, resulting in not just one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his career. ""Oppenheimer"" comes to Blu-ray in a 2.20:1 (1.78:1 for IMAX scenes), 1080p High Definition transfer of marvelous quality. The image is brilliantly sharp throughout, perfectly preserving all of the hard work that went into its incredible visuals. Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is outstanding, giving you all of the dialogue, sound effects, and Ludwig Göransson's score in excellent quality. Overall, you simply couldn't ask for better quality for such an extraordinary epic. The film comes with over three hours of fantastic extensive extras. The incredible ""Making of,"" told in seven chapters, is particularly worth checking out, while the ""To End All War"" documentary is great for those wanting to delve more into the man himself. With its brilliant screenplay skillfully weaving together three different periods, an exceptional ensemble, stunning technical & design elements, and magnificent direction bringing it all together, Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" stands not only as one of the very best films of the year, but also one of the finest accomplishments of his remarkable career.",POSITIVE
"Nov 20, 2023"," 
	Christopher Nolan has expended an enormous amount of creative energy serving as director, producer, and writer of this engrossing biopicture about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant American theoretical physicist who oversaw the secret Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop an atomic bomb. This bold, intense, inventively filmed, and well-acted thriller is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.
 
	As if taking off from that line, Nolan has structured his film around two heart-breaking incidents in Oppenheimer’s life. First and foremost, of course, is his role in the development of the bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945 and three days later on Nagasaki.
 
	The second incident is a secret hearing held in 1954 to determine whether to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance. Supposedly, it was to investigate Oppenheimer’s ties with known Communists early in his career and with suspected disloyal scientists at Los Alamos. But the investigators were also concerned about his outspoken statements against the hydrogen bomb (yet to be developed), his advocacy of arms control and against nuclear proliferation, and his concerns about the arms race during the Cold War with Russia. How could the “father of the bomb” end up opposed to it?
 
	Nolan has chosen to film the scenes of the hearing in black-and-white (as if such confrontations could ever be that simple). Through Oppenheimer’s own and others’ testimonies, we learn of his studies at Harvard, Cambridge, and the University of Gottingen in Germany, and his later position as lead physicist at Berkeley. We see him interacting with his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) and his girlfriend Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), both members of the Community Party. His wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) also had Communist ties, though she affirms that her husband had never joined the party.
 
	In flashbacks to key moments of his career, we see Oppenheimer interacting with scientists Niles Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). We observe his relationship with General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the government watchdog over the three-year, $2 billion Manhattan Project. We also see the development of a rivalry with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) who was instrumental in pushing for the security hearing.
 
	Throughout the film, Cillian Murphy seems to literally embody the mental genius and pained emotional and ethical presence of the pioneering physicist and persecuted anti-nuclear activist. His amazing performance sweeps across 40 years of academic competition, political chicanery, courtroom drama, espionage, right-wing paranoia, antisemitism, technological advance, and ethical debate.

"Nov 19, 2023"," Heavy is the head…with great power comes… and many other turns of phrase have been conjured up over the years to distill the consequences of wisdom and knowledge. Aside from that of Jesus, no story is more universal in Western culture than the myth of Prometheus. The god who is purported not only to have carved out man from the clay of earth but to have stolen fire from the gods and brought it to mankind forever changing us. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is a distillation of the perennial truths such phrases reference and the myth of Prometheus channeled into one of the most important men of the 20th century, J. Robert Oppenheimer for whom the film is named. Frequent Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy plays the role of Oppenheimer with tenderness, nuance, and a fun unapologetic aloofness. Too many noteworthy faces appear beside him to list them all but a few standouts are: Emily Blunt as Kitty his wife, Matt Damon as a military general, and David Krumholtz as his friend and peer Isidor Isaac. The picture alternates between two events years after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki: a backroom kangaroo court in which Macon Blair’s Lloyd Garrison guides Oppenheimer through a sham hearing; and a separate senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (performed with great care by Robert Downey Jr.). In the course of these two hearings, witnesses made up mainly of scientists and military men are brought in to recall events and answer questions.  The two hearings are labeled “Fission” and “Fusion” respectively, and within them the series of flashbacks that make up the meat of the film occur, driving the story forward and in a way mirroring the principal of waves. Ludwig Göransson’s deft use of sound queues viewers in casually to the alternations between the structure of the various complex beats Nolan and editor Lame built. With pitch-perfect contributions by Nolan’s previous collaborators on the craft team and some newcomers, every inch of every image feels meticulous.",POSITIVE

"Oct 25, 2023"," The filmmakerâs upcoming biopic, âOppenheimerâ is about the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” is particularly relevant in a world that’s in the midst of war. Christopher Nolan’s âOppenheimerâ is an adaptation of the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, written by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The trailers for Nolanâs movie have already been published, revealing its breath-taking graphics and equally impressive cast, along with inventive vision of the director. Being focused on Cillian Murphy, who plays the title character, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the filmâs impressively assembled ensemble also includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie and Robert Downey Jr. According to USA Today Christopher Nolanâs historical thriller Oppenheimer, has been called the most important story of our time. Written and directed by Nolan, Oppenheimer will be in theatres July 21and it chronicles the 1940s origins of the atomic bomb and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimerâs work with fellow scientists as part of the Manhattan Project. A new video featurette (debuting exclusively at usatoday.com) reveals fresh footage plus digs into the film’s plot, use of practical effects and real locations (such as the campus of Princeton University and Oppenheimer’s house in New Mexico), and the A-list cast Nolan has assembled to tell his story. Based on the biography called American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the movie traces the life and times of the titular nuclear physicist who is referred to as the âfather of atomic bombâ for his contribution to the Manhattan Project, which led to the development of first nuclear weapon. This is the first project by Nolan in more than two decades that does not involve Warner Bros, the studio with which he had a falling out over the release strategy of his last pic, the science-fiction action-thriller ‘Tenet’. ‘Oppenheimer’ has both been written and directed by Nolan, which is not unusual for him. Hoyte van Hoytema, who Nolan also collaborated on ‘Interstellar’ and ‘Dunkirk’, will handle the camera. Jennifer Lame is the editor. Ludwig GÃ¶ransson has written the background score, returning from ‘Tenet’. The cast includes Damon as Manhattan Project director Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr., Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s biologist wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie as theoretical physicist Edward Teller and Josh Hartnett as nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence. In the 1940s during World War II when Oppenheimer, a nuclear physicist, was appointed as the director of an initiative code-named “The Manhattan Project,” led a team of scientists in a Los Alamos lab to work on and develop the atomic bomb. The Father of the Atom Bomb, Oppenheimer and his team created this weapon which gave US the edge in World War II. The world, after the discovery of atomic bomb was never the same. This became the most dangerous device invented by mankind and the cause of all wars and power plays. Christopherâs most awaited criminal documentary, Oppenheimer is set to fly into theatres smack-dab, on July 21 across all IMAX screens across India. Known for his Hollywood blockbusters with complex storytelling, Christopher has won hearts already on a national scale â releasing the suspense thriller documentary in Hindi as well for audiences all over India!",POSITIVE
"Oct 5, 2023"," Si no has estado con la cabeza enterrada en el suelo durante los últimos meses y tienes cierto interés en el cine, sabrás ya que este fin de semana le pertenece a “Barbenheimer” o a “Oppenbarbie”, es decir, los curiosos términos que se crearon en la redes para referirse al estreno simultáneo de dos superproducciones muy distintas y muy esperadas. Nadie les podrá quitar el dominio, aunque se asoma por ahí un insólito competidor. Cuando yo era un niño y vivía todavía en Perú, una de las historias reales que más me impresionaron fue el lanzamiento por parte de Estados Unidos de dos bombas atómicas en solo tres días y en medio de ciudades japonesas densamente pobladas. El número de muertes, que algunas fuentes colocan por encima de 200 mil, y el hecho de que la mayoría de las víctimas fueran civiles, me parecían hechos absolutamente devastadores sin justificación alguna. ¿Que había pasado con los responsables directos de lo que para mí eran masacres inauditas?, me preguntaba. ¿Fueron capaces de dormir tranquilos luego de estos actos? Tuve algún tipo de respuesta al enterarme del caso de Claude Eatherly, un piloto vinculado a la misión de ataque que fue consumido por la culpa y cuya salud mental se fue deteriorando progresivamente con el paso de los años. Pero no estaba realmente familiarizado con J. Robert Oppenheimer, el físico estadounidense que ha sido llamado “el padre de la bomba atómica” y que, tras lo sucedido en Hiroshima y Nagasaki, se convirtió en un férreo defensor del control nuclear y armamentístico, como leo ahora. “Oppenheimer”, la película de Christopher Nolan que se encuentra ya en cartelera, intenta remediar la falta de conocimiento sobre este personaje trascendental valiéndose de una propuesta particularmente ambiciosa que rehúsa constantemente los dictámenes del ‘biopic’ convencional para transformarse en una reconstrucción épica de las vivencias del científico vinculadas tanto al Proyecto Manhattan -encargado de construir la bomba- como a las vicisitudes posteriores de su vida, marcadas por los cuestionamientos que se le hicieron debido a sus simpatías iniciales por el comunismo. El resultado es ciertamente impresionante y loable, y lo es por diversas razones. La primera pertenece al ámbito estrictamente cinematográfico, y tiene que ver con el hecho de que la cinta se filmó empleando una combinación de IMAX y 65mm que le brinda una grandeza muy particular, además de lucir magníficamente en una pantalla IMAX (es decir, la manera en que la vi). Pero eso no debe llevar a pensar que “Oppenheimer” es simplemente un espectáculo visual; de hecho, la mayor parte de sus escenas se desarrollan en entornos cerrados y se concentran en los rostros de sus personajes. Esta es también una cinta que tiene que verse por la manera en que cuestiona las decisiones militares de las superpotencias y el modo en que estas pueden afectar a la Humanidad entera. Nolan, quien escribió también el guión, no deja de colocar sobre la mesa los argumentos que señalaban la necesidad de un ataque sin precedentes para poder acabar con un conflicto (la Segunda Guerra Mundial) que había cobrado ya millones de víctimas; pero las imágenes que muestran a los ciudadanos estadounidenses celebrando con estruendo el cruel bombardeo dicen más que mil palabras. Pese a ello, uno de los aspectos menos logrados del filme es su exceso de palabras. Nolan hace un trabajo admirable al transmitirnos de manera sencilla algunos conceptos complejos de la física cuántica, y la primera parte de la historia, marcada por aires de ‘thriller’, resulta absolutamente cautivadora. Sin embargo, los constantes saltos en el tiempo -el filme tiene tres segmentos intercalados, filmados en formatos distintos- y la abundancia de conversaciones entre personas relacionadas al tema llegan en cierto momento a ser abrumadores, sobre todo porque la cinta dura tres horas. No ayuda tampoco en ese sentido el excesivo peso que se le da a la banda sonora de Ludwig Göransson, cuyo volumen impide en varios momentos la apreciación correcta de lo que se dice. “Oppenheimer” es un alegato antibelicista y un estudio sobre la redención que, por ello mismo, demanda la exhibición compleja de circunstancias psicológicas y emocionales. Por ese lado, y a pesar de dejar en claro su posición, Nolan no logra desprenderse del todo de esa gelidez que lo ha acompañado a lo largo de su carrera, ni es todavía capaz de desarrollar a personajes femeninos realmente creíbles. Pero lo que ha puesto ante nuestros ojos merece definitivamente ser visto, como lo merece también la increíble actuación de Cillian Murphy en el papel de Oppenheimer y la de un irreconocible pero fantástico Robert Downey Jr. en el rol de Lewis Strauss, el empresario que financió la construcción de las armas nucleares. “Fuera de aquí, fascista”, le dice una adolescente a Barbie durante los primeros minutos de la película, llamada con el mismo nombre de la famosa muñeca y disponible desde hoy en salas. Este simple hecho demuestra lo equivocados que están todos los que, sin haber hecho las averiguaciones correspondientes, se encuentran convencidos de que este es un trabajo complaciente, superficial y bobo que se ha hecho sobre la base de una línea de juguetes complaciente, superficial y boba. Estas averiguaciones les hubieran permitido descubrir, por ejemplo, que “Barbie” (la película) ha sido dirigida por Greta Gerwig, la creadora de la estupenda -y nada complaciente- “Lady Bird” (2017), y escrita por ella misma al lado de Noah Baumbach, realizador y escritor de filmes tan brillantes -y tan poco complacientes- como “The Squid and the Whale” (2005) y “Marriage Story” (2019). Para ser claros, “Barbie” ha sido producida por Mattel Films, la división cinematográfica de Mattel, que es la compañía creadora de la muñeca. Esto podría hacer que quienes piensan que la misma empresa es una entidad perversa que solo se interesa en el dinero, y cuya mayor invención promueve ideales imposibles de riqueza y de belleza, descarten por completo su visionado, incluso cuando, al menos de manera parcial, el mismo filme presenta a Mattel como una entidad perversa que solo se interesa el dinero y cuya invención más grande promueve ideales imposibles de riqueza y de belleza. Se vea como se vea, la cinta de Gerwig, que se estrena con una clasificación de PG-13, es susceptible de generar polémica. La promoción descarada que termina haciendo de las diferentes versiones de Barbie y Ken, surgidas con el paso de los años para lidiar con la falta de diversidad y los reclamos de sus consumidores, está evidentemente destinada a incrementar las ventas de una línea que ha perdido lustre con el paso del tiempo. Pero es a la vez una de las mejores películas del año en términos cinematográficos, probablemente la mejor comedia que hayamos visto en mucho tiempo y un producto extraordinariamente entretenido que promueve valores acordes con la búsqueda de una sociedad más justa. Por ese lado, habrá otra controversia, por supuesto. En la película, Barbie (interpretada por la maravillosa Margot Robbie) se ve obligada a abandonar brevemente el mundo de fantasía en el que vive, y que se encuentra dominado por las mujeres, luego de alterar involuntariamente el estado de las cosas. Al llegar al ‘mundo real’ -más precisamente, a la ciudad de Los Ángeles- acompañada por Ken (Ryan Gosling), queda desconcertada ante el dominio del patriarcado, a diferencia de lo que sucede con Ken, quien se siente cada vez más fascinado por el cambio de roles. No estoy usando la palabra ‘patriarcado’ gratuitamente. Los diálogos de Gerwig y Baumbach la emplean constantemente, hasta el punto de hacer que pierda contundencia y se sienta forzada. En todo caso, Hollywood impuso en el mundo entero sus proclamas de supremacía blanca y de dominio masculino a lo largo de casi toda su historia, por lo que las prédicas feministas no me parecen desacertadas, incluso cuando carecen de sutileza. Lo importante aquí es que, sin dejar nunca de lado lo que quiere comunicar, la película tiene momentos absolutamente hilarantes, así como referencias a la mitología ‘barbiana’ y a la historia del séptimo arte que deberían complacer tanto a los fans del popular juguete como a los cinéfilos más acérrimos. Por otro lado, la puesta en escena, respaldada por una excelente labor del director de fotografía mexicano Rodrigo Prieto (“Brokeback Mountain”), resulta ingeniosa, colorida y encantadora. Y no hay que olvidarse de la actriz latina America Ferrera, quien tiene un papel destacado -y finalmente decisivo- al interpretar a Gloria, una empleada de Mattel con conciencia propia. En vista de que la cartelera de este fin de semana tiene ya ganadores incuestionables y absolutos, cualquier otro estreno que se produzca en los mismos días tiene todas las de perder, y los estudios lo saben. Esto significa que, en esos casos, los lanzamientos que se hacen no cuentan probablemente con un gran nivel de confianza por parte de sus distribuidores. Pero si bien “Cobweb” es un título menor, sobre todo cuando se lo compara con “Oppenheimer” y “Barbie”, no se trata tampoco de una película descartable. Tiene incluso el potencial de atraer de manera significativa a quienes opten por evitar las salas completamente llenas y favorezcan las propuestas pertenecientes a otros géneros, en este caso, el terror, que resulta normalmente rentable en los cines debido a su gran nivel de aceptación. En su primer trabajo como director de largometrajes, Samuel Bodin hace gala de un dominio de la puesta en escena que resulta ciertamente sorprendente. “Cobweb” posee un gran sentido de la atmósfera, y los recursos visuales que emplea, mayormente prácticos, son los responsables principales de su efectividad en el área de los sustos, aunque tampoco decepciona la elaboración de la ‘criatura’, realizada evidentemente con el aporte de elaborados trucos digitales. A pesar de no ser necesariamente original y de tener varios momentos que ponen a prueba la credibilidad, como suele suceder en las propuestas comerciales provenientes del horror, el guión de Chris Thomas Devlin logra mantenernos en vilo e incluye momentos bastante brutales, mientras cuenta la historia de Peter (Woody Norman), un pre adolescente que vive en una vieja casona embrujada al lado de sus dos padres, Carol (Lizzy Kaplan) y Mark (Antony Starr), quienes empiezan a dar muestras de inestabilidad cada vez más alarmantes a medida que transcurre el relato.

"Oct 2, 2023"," “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan's mammoth and exhausting portrait of the father of the atomic bomb, desperately wants to impress you, but it's too high on its own fumes to make good on its lofty ambitions. The “Inception” auteur's first effort after parting ways with Warner Bros. adapts the Pulitzer Prize-winning Oppenheimer biography “American Prometheus” for the screen (the bigger the better). It detonates all sorts of conflicting emotions, but let's go with the top two: awe at its visual splendor and impressionistic cadences, and frustration at its stubborn insistence in stitching together two films in one. There's the one you probably came to see, which is the story of a team of brainy academics brought together to create a weapon of mass destruction before those across the Atlantic do, and thus secure a victory for the Allied powers during World War II. But the Universal release also springs forward several years to offer a glimpse at the political fallout, lathered in backstabbing and guilt, from those twin mushroom clouds. The latter narrative strand initially appears to serve as a framing device for the first one. It's mostly comprised of a series of hearings in 1954, behind closed doors, by the Atomic Energy Commission, in order to determine whether J. Robert Oppenheimer, now nearly a decade removed from his best-known accomplishment, will retain his security clearance. The hearings provide Nolan with an engine to hone in on Oppenheimer's public and private life. The bulk of “Oppenheimer” unfolds in these artfully crafted flashbacks, bolstered by quick cuts, stream-of-consciousness links between different moments in time, set to the relentless drone of Ludwig Goransson's wall-to-wall music score. It's an ornate fever dream that metastasizes into a nightmare, in ways that are initially thrilling but ultimately draining. You feel your enthusiasm ebb away. Nolan takes us as far back as Oppenheimer's days in Cambridge, where a student with disdain for mathematics and lab work meets fellow travelers who will prove to be pivotal figures in the years to come. That apt but restless pupil, played as a young man and as the eventual agent of destruction by Cillian Murphy, is encouraged by Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to complete his doctorate at the University of Gottingen in Germany.  Oppenheimer meets fellow theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg (Matthia Schweighofer). Both men are mutual admirers, fully unaware they would be on opposing sides on the arms race in the coming conflict. Serving as a conscience and a welcome source of warmth for our driven protagonist is fellow physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi (a nearly unrecognizable David Krumholtz, quietly becoming one of the movie's MVPs). “Oppenheimer” could have used more of the modesty that the pudgy Rabi, with his maternal instinct to remind the rail-thin Oppie to “eat, eat,” brings to the table, but Nolan forges ahead as if he's making the cinematic equivalent of the great American novel. Back on U.S. soil, Oppenheimer's associations include members of the Communist Party, though he keeps his distance. He begins a sordid affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a party member who happens to be a married woman, before he meets Kitty (Emily Blunt), the woman he would eventually wed. Rare (for Nolan) glimpses of lovemaking ensue, climaxing with a surreal flourish later in the film that draws unintentional laughs. Nolan may not be afraid to show sex on screen (though Murphy shows conspicuously less skin than Pugh), but the director remains a bit of a square in that department. But “Oppenheimer” can't stop, won't stop, and after overcoming several hurdles, Uncle Sam comes knocking, in the form of U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the Corps of Engineers officer who directed the ultra-secret Manhattan Project. The verbal sparring between Oppie and Groves, leading to Oppie spearheading the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, is one of the film's highlights.  The fireworks that the characters' arguments generate, acted to perfection by the stars, go against the rest of the film's eat-your-veggies approach to 20th-century history, thus underscoring the need for “Oppenheimer's” against-the-clock Manhattan Project scenes to be their own movie, unencumbered by the added weight of the film's cause-and-effect framing. (Several scenes involving Oppie and Albert Einstein, well played by Tom Conti, attempt to weave in both timelines, but they're not enough.) To give credit where credit is due, Nolan nails the “money shot” sequence: the do-or-die nuclear test that proved beyond the shadow of a doubt that the atom bomb would serve its lethal purpose and bring the war to an end. But then it dawns of you that the movie's not quite done. Not even close. In what feels like an additional hour (it's a bit less, but goodness, you feel the length), “Oppenheimer” returns to the 1954 hearings and dives headlong into the ripple effects of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. This is when the spotlight shines on Robert Downey Jr.'s Lewis Strauss -- businessman, philanthropist, naval officer, member of the Atomic Energy Commission and ostensible helping hand to an embattled Oppenheimer besieged by attacks on his character. Downey takes the juicy role and runs with it. The “Iron Man” star helps anchor several scenes (shot in IMAX black and white, a first for Kodak) where Strauss, up for a Cabinet post in the Eisenhower administration several years after the AEC Oppenheimer hearings, is grilled by senators about Oppenheimer and the nuclear program.  Taken on their own, the 1950s scenes are a gripping if somewhat naïve and simplistic, portrayal of politics as a Darwinian game of chess. They also swallow the film whole, dampening the excitement we feel as this group of scientists pull off the seemingly impossible. “Oppenheimer” would have benefited from a splitting of atomic particles, or in this case, narratives into two different films. Subtlety is not a Nolan specialty, and “Oppenheimer” fuses his strengths and self-indulgent tendencies into a maelstrom of sound and fury that bring to mind Oliver Stone in full-tilt “JFK” mode. Some of the intricate cross-cutting also recalls Terrence Malick, “The Tree of Life” in particular, but Nolan and his bells and whistles lack Malick's humility before the infinite. To be fair, “Oppenheimer” is a sizable step up from “Tenet,” Nolan's impenetrable 2020 thriller that's toppled by its convoluted time-hopping spy games.  But his latest effort is too much of an endurance test, a magnum opus consumed by its quest for significance. Caught in the middle is a uniformly strong cast made up of too many other familiar faces to name here. As for Murphy, the “Peaky Blinders” star rises above the chaos. It's a pity the movie ends up imploding, its adroitly conceived puzzle pieces coming apart in a rain of noble intentions and unmitigated ego.

"Sep 29, 2023"," Christopher Nolan ha sido un férreo defensor del cine físico durante toda su carrera. Ya lo era antes de la pandemia, pero tras ver que el 'streaming' se ha comido la magia de la pantalla grande tras el confinamiento, ha resurgido decidido a demostrar que las películas están hechas para disfrutarlas lejos del salón de tu casa. Todo eso se percibe en la espectacularidad de Oppenheimer. La película sobre el físico destaca por el uso del sonido, que ya había mostrado en otras obras como Dunkerque (2018) o Tenet (2020). Si esas ya fueron muestras absolutas de su maestría con este lenguaje cinematográfico, esta vez se supera a sí mismo. Así consigue que Oppenheimer sea una película sobre la bomba atómica en la que los momentos más angustiosos se producen cuando reina el silencio absoluto en la sala.",POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2023"," The first indication that Christopher Nolan was going to be a unique and interesting filmmaker was there for all to see with his noteworthy second feature, “Memento,” which was released in 2000 when he was 30 years of age. The movie’s non-linear narrative is delivered as two different sets of scenes interspersed during the film. There are sequences in color that are shown in reverse order, which reveal the mental state of the protagonist to the audience. Some scenes are shown chronologically in black-and-white. Nolan likes to play fast and loose with time and space. If he isn’t careful, this form of narrative storytelling can become pretentious. If he’s running on all cylinders, there’s an elegance to his movies that is beautiful and satisfying to behold. Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is beautiful to behold. Whether or not it’s satisfying depends on your appreciation for how he creates his cinema. The film is a feast of non-linear moviemaking. It’s the most Nolanesque feature he’s made. The story that’s front-and-center during the epic three-hour movie is the making of the atomic bomb during the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and its use on two Japanese cities, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in a successful effort, which was approved by President Harry S. Truman, with the hopes of ending the war in the Pacific. Born in New York City, J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life, as highlighted in the film, is centered around Princeton University in New Jersey, Cambridge in England, the University of California at Berkeley, the extended sojourn at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the building of the bomb, and intense political hearings courtesy of the Washington, D.C. witch hunt for Communist sympathizers in the United States government. “Oppenheimer” the movie is rich in detail. That it unreels in flashbacks and flash-forwards may be maddening for some, but not for me. It’s also in black-and-white and in color. In “Oppenheimer,” Nolan takes an intelligent topic and turns it into a suspenseful experience. The director, who wrote the screenplay based on the biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, has the canvas to concentrate on theoretical physicist Oppenheimer’s intellectualism, ever-increasing self-confidence, internal thought processes, poise and popularity as a leader, and relationships with women (he was unfaithful to his wife). Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is central to the greatness of the casting. Murphy never loses J. Robert’s sense of duty or his belief that his goal is to save the lives of members of the American military by succeeding with the Manhattan Project. He’s a man who rarely eats. He cares about everybody who’s working on the bomb. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who oversees Los Alamos for Truman, is the kind of general that’s needed when time is of the essence. Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife Katherine (Emily Blunt) provides necessary strength when it matters most. His mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) was a psychiatrist and occasional journalist. Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) is visited in scenes of visual poetry. Does the movie falter in any way? Yes, but not enough to derail it for me. Once the atomic bomb is dropped, there’s still 40 minutes to go, and it’s here that Nolan lets the subject matter get away from him slightly. Oppenheimer wasn’t onboard with the U. S. government’s desire to progress from the atomic to the hydrogen bomb. Truman calls him a “crybaby.” This reluctance commands most of the film’s attention as Senate and House hearings revolving around Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss’s future in Washington and Oppenheimer’s sudden disfavor with certain politicians are dissected in brutally intense black-and-white sequences that prove exhausting as because they go on far too long. Nolan is insistent on making certain the focus stays on his main character. So much so, that Japan and the horrors caused by the dropping of the bomb are only hinted at. Is Oppenheimer a Communist? Was his wife? Is he a traitor for not wanting to continue to create weapons of mass destruction? Some of the material could have been edited more tightly. The saving grace for these seemingly endless scenes of political performance art are twofold. One is Murphy’s ability to project an almost religious dedication to the rightness of Oppenheimer’s beliefs. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the body count appalled him. The other is the scintillating performance by Robert Downey Jr. as Strauss, a bureaucratic game player of the highest order. The moment when Strauss realizes what Oppenheimer is actually doing in front of the determined members of Congress is motion picture acting Nirvana. The 1954 hearing to adjudicate whether or not Oppenheimer’s federal security should be renewed allows Nolan almost infinite time to spin his directorial vision in myriad directions, some previously hinted at, some unique, but all defining Nolan the director and Oppenheimer the man. The “father of the atomic bomb” is well-served. One truth in the the movie is that the female characters track with what history recorded. In that era, women were less than equal and except for wives and the occasional secretary, Los Alamos was a man’s world. In the overall story, Mrs. Oppenheimer and her husband’s mistress are the most visible female characters. Oppenheimer is a fascinating individual. His intense dreams are either rapturous or tormenting. He figuratively visits the cosmos in them. He’s a scientist, but for him science is an art form. The true and genuine highlight for Nolan, Murphy, and the movie is the immediate build-up to, and then the explosion of, the test bomb. It’s a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come.

"Sep 17, 2023"," No figure stands more squarely at the crossroads of 20th century science and politics than J. Robert Oppenheimer, forever known as “father of the atomic bomb”. An epic story requires an epic film, and Christopher Nolan has given Oppenheimer the treatment he demands, in a three-hour bio pic that manages to balance a portrait of this enigmatic personality with the earth-shattering events that defined his life and times. For Nolan, it’s a remarkably well-organised film, considering that his previous effort, Tenet (2020), was virtually incomprehensible. One suspects this owes a debt to a script written in collaboration with Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, authors of the 2005 Oppenheimer biography, American Prometheus. The film doesn’t tell us anything about Oppenheimer’s upbringing as part of a wealthy Jewish family in New York that owned paintings by Van Gogh and Picasso. We skip straight to his post-graduate studies at Cambridge, where he is clumsy in the laboratory, but a prodigious theorist. He’s also unstable enough to inject an apple with poison, as a way of getting even with a lecturer who humiliates him. It’s an anecdote to demonstrate the old cliché that genius and madness are closely aligned. If we need further proof of our subject’s mental dexterity, there’s also the small matter of learning Dutch in six weeks so he can deliver a lecture on quantum mechanics. Oppenheimer’s backstory is told in flashbacks, framed by his appearance in front of a select committee in 1954, where he is being investigated as a security risk. At this stage he is the most famous scientist in America, renowned for his leadership at Los Alamos, but his credibiity has been undermined by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who has worked behind the scenes to bring Oppenheimer down. It’s a complex relationship between the two men, as Strauss had been a key supporter of Oppenheimer, but turned against him after the scientist made him look foolish in a hearing. The story of the Atom bomb is rotated with this tale of political and personal intrigue, in which Strauss plays Iago to Oppenheimer’s Othello. The resonances with present-day politics are unmistakable, as we recognise echoes of the way public health experts and environmental scientists were demonised by opportunistic politicians in the Trump camp – a process that has bled into the public realm via social media and extremist opinion-mongering masquerading as news. To be truly without blemish in front of a committee in the McCarthy era, it wasn’t sufficient to have demonstrated one’s loyalty to the United States by helping develop the greatest weapon of mass destruction in history. As we see during the flashbacks, Oppenheimer took a lively interest in politics. He was a vocal supporter of the Spanish republic, he argued for the unionisation of the science department at Berkeley, and associated with Communist Party members, including Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a disturbed ‘fatal attraction’ with whom he had a long-running affair. Strauss and his colleagues, notably Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, were aware of Oppenheimer’s political beliefs when they enlisted him to head up the Manhattan Project. The USA was in competition the Germans in the race to build a nuclear weapon, and Oppenheimer was simply the best man for the job. As a non-observant Jew with left-wing sympathies, his antipathy for the Nazis overruled any scruples about the destructive force he was about to release on the world. The argument was compelling: if the Germans got the bomb first, they would be sure to use it. For the Americans, who styled themselves as guardians of democracy, it could conceivably act as a deterrent to unjust wars – a weapon of peace. Oppenheimer chose the location for the secret laboratories and testing grounds in the New Mexico desert, he assembled the scientists he needed for the project, and brought it to fruition. When the Third Reich collapsed but the Japanese fought on, work on the bomb continued. The scientists created the weapon, but its deployment was a matter for the politicians. When Harry Truman dropped bombs on Hiroshima, then Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August, 1945, Oppenheimer seems to have been stricken with guilt and remorse for what he had done. Although publically celebrated as the father of the A-bomb, he used his influence to argue against the development of an even greater weapon, the H-bomb, which was being promoted by his colleague, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). By 1954, when he sat before the security committee, Oppenheimer’s pacifism had made him a suspect figure among America’s Cold Warriors. This distrust was exploited by the devious Strauss. The third strand of this movie looks at Strauss’s efforts to get himself confirmed by a Senate Committee as Head of the Atomic Energy Commission, with his press secretary, played by Alden Ehrenreich, gradually teasing out the true nature of his boss’s double game. Oppenheimer owes a huge part of its success to Cillian Murphy’s performance. The Irish actor who always seems to play supporting roles, has relished the opportunity to step into the limelight, and must now be in contention for an Oscar. His achievement is to portray Oppenheimer, not just as a haunted man, but as a lifelong misfit whose intelligence set him apart from every peer group. Oppenheimer tells his Communist friends he has read all three volumes of Das Kapital but found Marx’s arguments unconvincing. He sees no reason why he shouldn’t support just causes, such as the Spanish Republic or unionism, when there are obvious strategic reasons to stay away. The place he loves most in the world is the New Mexico desert, but it’s here he produces the first nuclear explosion. There is an intellectual arrogance to Oppenheimer that infuriates his opponents, and occasionally trips him up. Having taken on the task of building the bomb, he has to front up and celebrate the strike on Hiroshima while he is inwardly reeling at the magnitude of horror he has helped unleash. He finds it difficult to defend himself against determined but dishonest opponents, even as his angry wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), urges him to act. If Oppenheimer is a philosopher amid the dirty realities of politics, Lewis Strauss is a disciple of Machiavelli. Robert Downey Jr. is so good in this role, one could almost forget all his past misdeeds, on and off the screen. The rest of the cast is a who’s who of Hollywood talent, with figures such as Kenneth Branagh (Niels Bohr), Tom Conti (Albert Einstein) and Gary Oldman (Harry S. Truman), being assigned minor but crucial parts. It’s rare that a film manages to look at a figure as monumental as Oppenheimer, without caricaturing him as a hero or villain. The scientist is in part the author of his downfall, but also a victim of circumstances and outright conspiracy. After spending three hours in his company, we can’t exactly approve or disapprove. Oppenheimer is a flawed genius who can grapple with the intricacies of quantum mechanics but can’t resolve the moral dilemmas that plague his public and private lives. He is a figure that invites the most dramatic comparisons, not just as Prometheus, who stole fire from the Gods, but the man, in the Gospel of St. Mark, who gains the whole world and loses his own soul.",POSITIVE

"Sep 12, 2023"," Robert Angier wanted to perform the perfect magic trick, Dom Cobb wanted to live his perfect dream (literally), Joseph Cooper wanted to find a perfect planet; now, Christopher Nolan has made a biopic on the man who wanted to create the perfect bomb. But let’s get this out of the way first; does the film’s main event, termed as a cinematic experience for the ages on IMAX, live up to its almost unbearable expectations? Well, yes and no.  But the explosion in isolation (just the Trinity one; Nolan makes the divisive decision not to show the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings) does not justify the hype, as hair-raising a visual achievement it may be. Instead, the filmmaker completely goes for the jugular and paralyses us with shock in a scene right after, when “the father of the atomic bomb” has to address a crowd of colleagues who are stomping their feet in rhythm, cheering the attacks on the Japanese cities. A traumatised ‘Oppie’ (as his friends call him) — now in full realisation of the horrors he has unleashed upon the planet — stammers his way through what is meant to be a victory jaunt, as he hallucinates the phantoms of his horrific creation that would change the course of history. With help from composer Ludwig Göransson’s anxiety-inducing score, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema’s staggering use of 65-millimeter film, and editor Jennifer Lame’s frenetic frames, Nolan takes you deep into the mind (and all its tragic machinations) of a protagonist repelled by his own eminence and tortured by his futile attempt to advocate against further nuclear development. His primary weapon of choice is Cillian Murphy, who has been around forever but still remains strangely unseen except in Nolan’s universe and his career-defining turn as Thomas Shelby. The Irishman in the role of Oppenheimer is a true casting coup (one of many in the film) with his gaunt face and haunting eyes tormenting you with every piercing gaze, glance and grimace. Here, he’s magnetic in the role of the scientist who bent the world to his will and whim for decades, until it finally stops revolving around him. The physical resemblance notwithstanding, Murphy captures Oppenheimer’s internal turmoil and external arrogance with some amount of immodest ease; we never quite understand him fully, but that’s precisely what Nolan wants.  But Oppenheimer’s sprawl both astounds and frustrates. Nolan, of course, complicates the chronology like only Nolan can; we are thrown head-first into different timelines — that switch between dazzling colour and black-and-white — representing both ‘fission’ and ‘fusion,’ two terms the director uses right at the beginning of the film, to indicate how energy is created and dissipated.  From his beginnings in the 1920s as a genius student galvanized by the prospect of making breakthroughs in quantum mechanics, to teaching and collaborating with other prodigious minds at Berkeley, to embracing the leftist ideals that would later invigorate him to develop the bomb ahead of the Nazis, Nolan charts Oppenheimer’s early days in linear-enough fashion. The dialogues and debates bristle with a kinetic sort of energy that is palpable, and we remain invested in all the dizzying equations and exposition that should rightfully perplex, but somehow make sense. Things then get heated. Oppenheimer quickly encounters a number of people who will have far-reaching ramifications on his life, such as nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett well and truly owning his renaissance), the stern but supportive Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (a fantastic-as-usual Matt Damon), and the eventual hydrogen bomb inventor Edward Teller (Benny Safdie in a bit of a hard sell). He’s also juggling the two women who make and (nearly) break him; the incendiary psychiatrist and Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) with whom he has a steamy on-and-off romance, and his wife, the boozy Kitty (a supremely disdainful Emily Blunt who surely deserved more screen time). There’s a revolving army of other supporting characters too — some fragmented, some whole, none streamlined — sportingly essayed by an array of stars that reads like a who’s who list of Hollywood royalty; Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Oppenheimer’s mentor), Gary Oldman as President Harry S Truman (naturally stealing the show with one of the best scenes set in the Oval Office after the bomb is dropped), Tom Conti as a regretfully ponderous Albert Einstein (!) and Rami Malek in a small but frightfully important cameo. It is Robert Downey Jr., though, who emerges as the film’s most prominent game-changer, and the Marvel superstar delivers the finest performance of his career as Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss, who makes it his mission to dismantle Oppenheimer’s credibility and service to the United States government. If that sounds like a lot to take in, it is. But this is where Nolan falters; the Strauss-Oppenheimer rivalry, fuelled by jealousy and humiliation, spirals into a full-blown revenge saga in the second half, primarily taking shape inside claustrophobic conference rooms populated with suits. From being an enigmatic origin story about one of the most legendary scientific minds in history, the film turns into part-courtroom battle, part-political drama, as Nolan tries to (or rather, lets us) decipher what Oppenheimer’s future legacy will be; it stifles more than it intrigues. Indeed, one of the rare times you crack a wry smile is when some US officials are ascertaining which Japanese cities to bomb, and one of them comments that he removed Kyoto from the list because his wife enjoyed their honeymoon there. Still, the monumental world Nolan creates often results in an immersive experience that is not often witnessed in biopics. Even if some stretches play out way too long, Oppenheimer constantly reminds us that everyone quickly recovered from the perversion of war to accept the bomb; a burden that we will forever share with Robert.

"Sep 6, 2023"," Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer? According to the history books he was either a saviour or a devil, and of course with his involvement in the development of the Atomic bomb he was certainly the embodiment of his famous quote lifted from the Bhagavad-Gita “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer posits Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as both and symbol and a man, but despite its expansive run-time never gives a clear answer to who he was. He remains enigmatic, a ‘sphynx’ as one character terms him. Genius, dilletante, womaniser, madman, egomaniac, innovator – all these adjectives are used to describe him, and all are correct, yet even when Nolan puts laser focus on the man and the myth, we are still left wondering. Perhaps we are left wondering because Nolan is actually not as interested in telling the audience about Oppenheimer as he is with crafting a political thriller and a treatise on what mutually assured destruction looks like. Oppenheimer was playing a zero-sum game from the moment he was recruited as head scientist for the Manhattan project, a fact that existed in the periphery of his understanding but never quite hit home until he finally delivered the bomb Truman was intent on using despite the war being ostensibly over. The film moves between timelines in Oppenheimer’s life. The young student who went to study in England who annoyed his professor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy) and impressed Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). The same young student would attempt to poison Blackett, give lectures in Dutch – a language he learned in weeks, shake the hand of Werner Heisenberg and develop a lifelong friendship with fellow Jewish physicist Isidor Rabi (an excellent David Krumholtz) all before returning to Berkeley to set up the first quantum physics curriculum. Intercut with Oppenheimer’s ostensibly linear story (Nolan rarely uses linear even when attempting linear) is his troubled relationship with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) the commissioner of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and the closed “trial” of Oppenheimer in 1954 in which he tried to keep his revoked Q clearance that had been taken from him under suspicion of communist activities during the McCarthy period. Nolan immerses the viewer in perspective by having Oppenheimer’s life in colour and Strauss’ machinations in black and white, including his attempt to enter cabinet as a congressman. Nolan is a technical wizard, one with a genius touch with his choices of cinematographers (the inimitable Hoyte Van Hoytema once again pairing with Nolan), production designers (Ruth De Jong), editors (Jennifer Lame) and composers (Ludwig Göransson who scored Tenet). He is also a capable script writer, yet somewhere in all this mastery is a small hollow. Oppenheimer is intensely humanistic, melancholy, enraged but not quite engaged. Dig through the film and cut some of the bloat and there is an astonishing piece of cinema. The bloat caveat aside, Nolan has created as masterpiece. Intelligent and insightful. The performances he elicits from Murphy, Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer are marvellous. Supporting cast such as Matt Damon as Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves who brought Oppenheimer on to the Manhattan project, Benny Safdie as rival scientist Edward Teller, Josh Hartnett as the apolitical engineering scientist Ernest Lawrence, and Jason Clarke as the ‘prosecutor’ Roger Robb all give committed and elevated performances. Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s doomed erstwhile lover Jean Tatlock is perhaps least served by the film. Oppenheimer’s story is too dense to recount in a simple review, so the key points of interest include his relationship with his unfulfilled and domestically resentful wife, Kitty (who was a scientist in her own right) whose affiliations with the communist party, as well as those of Jean Tatlock’s and Robert’s brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold) led him to be closely monitored for many years by the FBI. Oppenheimer’s brittle friendship with Albert Einstein (played with great heartbreak by Tom Conti), and of course his activities heading the Manhattan project out of El Paso. The bulk of the film revolves around the race to make the bomb before the Germans do, something Oppenheimer feels is his duty not only as an American but as a Jewish American. Isidor Rabi is reluctant to join the project because he does not want to see something as pure as theoretical physics being turned into a weapon. It’s a subtle warning that Oppenheimer does not heed at the time but one that will haunt him. There is a plenitudinous number of discussions about uranium, plutonium, core reactions, chain reactions, arguments between scientists of many allied nations (not Russia) all taking part in the race to beat the Nazis. Some of this is discussion is necessary for a sense of verisimilitude of the scientific process and also needed to show how Teller and Oppenheimer became bitter rivals. It does slow the pace of the film, which is breakneck in other areas, but once we reach the point of the Trinity trial Nolan’s exquisite mastery of form is on full display. He manages to inject small doses of humour into one of the most nail-biting sequences in the film – Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid) sits in his car and insists the windscreen will absorb the UV rays. Teller lathers himself in sunscreen. It all builds up to a crescendo where for the first time in the film Nolan employs a moment of silence during the flash of the explosion where the real voice of Oppenheimer speaks his famous line, and then the most bone rattling boom in recent cinema. The fact that the trial happened after the surrender of Germany weighed slightly on Oppenheimer and other scientists, they thought they were building the bomb to defeat the Nazis. Yet, like the man addicted to seeing his experiment through Oppenheimer steams ahead. As soon as he has delivered the successful test he is cut out of the military loop and like everyone else in the world hears of the bombings of Japan via Truman’s announcement on the radio. Nolan is clever enough to never show Hiroshima or Nagasaki and the aftermath. Instead, there is a sequence where Oppenheimer imagines he is stepping over burning bodies in a celebratory speech at Los Alamos. Nolan breaks with reality several times in the film and these are some of the best moments. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his life – his blue eyes bearing down into the camera filled with eternally conflicting emotions, and sometimes lacking emotion altogether. Robert Downey Jr. is easily giving his best dramatic performance since Chaplin and Emily Blunt is spellbinding as pragmatic but troubled alcoholic, Kitty. Matt Damon’s charm as an actor is used to every advantage as he plays off Murphy. Alden Ehrenreich is brilliant as an unnamed Senate Aide who pieces together Strauss’ conspiracy against Oppenheimer which was started by Strauss being embarrassed by Oppenheimer’s refusal to support the export of isotopes to foreign nations while Strauss was head of the AEC. The vindictive pettiness of Strauss is one of many factors that led to the slow downfall of an American hero. The other was Oppenheimer’s resistance to supporting the creation of hydrogen bombs, because as he well knew the arms race with the Soviet Union was triggered and men have a way of ensuring that the weapons they create, they use. Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date. With a cast that is stacked with talent (not even mentioned are Casey Affleck, Dane DeHaan, Remi Malek, David Dastmalchian, Alex Wolff, Matthew Modine, Gary Oldman) and a premise that allows Nolan to mix a certain level of intimate scale as well as spectacle with his material that was lacking in Tenet and to an extent, Interstellar, Oppenheimer is a merger of what Nolan does best as a director – even if the result is sometimes flawed. Who is J. Robert Oppenheimer? As Albert Einstein tells him, that is not up to him – his legacy will always belong to whoever wants to claim it for whatever purpose it will serve.

"Sep 2, 2023"," Since the writer/director burst onto the scene in 2000 with the neo-noir Memento, those who like ambitious yarns and foreboding push-ins have considered him a sure bet with each new release. Fans have claimed that The Prestige, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk are nothing short of masterpieces, while others cite the narrative geometry of Inception and Interstellar as their preferred brand of dense escapism. Yet, all of them are anchored by showstopping visuals captured on celluloid and with minimal CGI, making them optical stunners as well. The true test of Oppenheimer is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Fittingly, Nolan succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion — just like his protagonist. Per his own house style, Nolan doesn’t tell Oppenheimer in a linear fashion. Critics have called that a crutch in the past, but in his best features there’s always a reason for the structure. In Memento, Nolan wanted viewers to experience the unreliable memory of his protagonist by depriving them of established information. In Oppenheimer, he’s working at the intersection of time and space, catching molecules mid-dance, explosions pre-flare, and ultimately an entire life both assembling and blowing apart at the same time. Early on, we find J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) fighting homesickness as he struggles abroad to complete his PhD in physics. He can tell times are changing for Jewish people in Europe, but he also feels unwelcome because he’s primarily interested in theory over laboratory work. Upon returning to the United States to lecture on the emerging field of quantum mechanics, Oppenheimer is approached by US Army Officer Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who wants to name the physicist the director of the Manhattan Project. Suddenly, a man who was always satisfied with conjecture alone is given a chance to fight the Nazis by forcing theory into reality. Oppenheimer’s love life is integral to the proceedings, as it fleshes out who he is as a person — an egoist philanderer who’s never willing to give himself completely to one partner. Although his liaisons with communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) leave a mark, it’s biologist Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt) whom he eventually marries, despite her alcoholism and the grudge she carries for becoming a mother instead of an academic. Their embattled relationship isn’t quite the centerpiece of the story, but it serves as a deft fulcrum for the pivoting political drama. If that weren’t enough, Oppenheimer’s quest to make the first successful atom bomb is intercut with black-and-white sequences from years later that focus mostly on Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, a politician and the head of the Atomic Energy Commission. Strauss tries to flatter Oppenheimer into keeping America at the forefront of the arms race, which may have worked before the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki — but Oppenheimer grew into a different mindset later, arguing for de-escalation to salve his conscience. There’s no doubt this is a packed movie. Watching Oppenheimer is a bit like speed-reading a history textbook, except with great dialogue and a searing Ludwig Göransson score. It’s truly surprising how few effects sequences Nolan offers here. He still shoots a good chunk of the film in 65mm IMAX, but it’s most often deployed in bracing close-ups. The choice is subtle but effective: Murphy begins the film as a youthful neurotic emboldened by his own genius. Many of those early shots are in 35mm and traditional widescreen. By the end, our protagonist is hollowed to the core, and having his gaunt features stretched four stories high in full IMAX ratio is all Nolan needs to convey what is lost. Is there an Oscar in it for Murphy? After delivering great work for decades, this definitely feels like his time. His performance is impressively lived-in, while never feeling like he’s changing gears to evolve in the back half. Ditto for Downey Jr., who’s about as good here as he’s ever been. Strauss is a complex man; he’s unquestionably a patriot, but you never know where his true feelings end and his political ambitions begin. Top marks for Damon and Blunt as well, who distinguish themselves against a certified murderer’s row of supporting talent. In fact, the sheer volume of the cast is the only potential problem here, as some of the smaller roles end up being crucial to the narrative in the final hour. Of course, Nolan is upholding history to some degree, and it’s true that some folks weren’t very close with Oppenheimer and still were called to testify about him once the physicist began opposing hydrogen bomb research. It just would have been nice to feel those puzzle pieces falling into place instead of trying to recall which five-minute role a person played two hours ago. Despite that, we’re still talking about one of the best and most riveting biopics in recent memory. Some will bemoan how Nolan could have made a more conventional thriller that flexes the real fury of a mushroom cloud and gapes at cities flattened by fire. But it’s the space between molecules that Nolan is interested in. Like All the President’s Men and Zodiac before it, this epic chronicle of American history is more about the before and the after, the moments that birthed the revelations.  The director should be prepared to weather criticisms that he focuses entirely on the men behind the bomb and not the victims of its devastation. Yet a scene showing a host of government officials confronted with the brutality of their efforts spells out Nolan’s intent: The camera is kept firmly on Oppenheimer while his contemporaries react audibly to the horrors before their eyes. Here, Nolan has a perfect opportunity to show exactly what the Manhattan Project has wrought, but instead, we hear vivid descriptions of the Japanese victims while staring at the man responsible.  Nolan isn’t ignoring the lives destroyed; he just doesn’t want to dramatize them for the sake of pathos that’s already in the movie. The approach also drives a second layer of commentary where the film remains siloed in the myopic view of white men, as even today that’s how U.S. decision-makers experience the ravages they cause. Ultimately, the film draws immense power from what it doesn’t show — and still the fallout is palpable in every scene, burning bright and never fading.",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023"," Not quite your standard biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb”, Nolan’s latest casts slender Irishman Murphy as the titular scientist. Focusing his story around theoretical physicist Oppenheimer and his work leading up to and following the successful creation of the first nuclear bomb, Nolan captures a portrait of a brilliant man who was often in conflict with his work and his own proclivities. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer looks at a life both inside and out of the Manhattan Project and his interactions with the various scientists, students,  politicos, Communists, military generals, and women he encountered over the years. There has been much talk of Oppenheimer being Nolan’s best work, comparing it to Oliver Stone’s JFK in terms of scale, scope, and conspiracy. While I would argue that even an “okay” Nolan film is still a good film, as good as Oppenheimer is, it is simply is not his best (I’d rather reserve that accolade for the mind-bending Inception or Interstellar). At his best, however, is Murphy. Oppenheimer marks his third major role in a film for the director, having previously appeared in Dunkirk, Inception, and as one of the main villains in Batman Begins (and subsequent franchise cameos). The actor convincingly spans Oppenheimer’s life, from young intellectual in a lab through to the weary man whose brilliance wrought the deaths of hundreds of thousands, unleashing an awesome power that humanity perhaps should not hold. Murphy plays each iteration of Oppenheimer well, which is a must for an actor who is in virtually every scene of the films three-hour runtime. There is a lot of be said about the impressive ensemble of actors in Nolan’s film. To name just a few: Kenneth Branagh, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich, and Dane DeHaan. Quite obviously, there are only two women in that cast list, more or less a product of the scientific community of the era. Yes, there are a few women (and people of colour) in science lectures, classrooms, and in the Manhattan Project, but largely, this is the story of white men. Pugh and Blunt are the top-billed women with the former having only a small but pivotal role as an early one of Oppenheimer’s lovers. Blunt has much more screentime but even she isn’t given much to do as Oppenheimer’s wife with a fondness for drinking. Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting. Equally disjointed is the timeline of the film which clocks in at three-hours. Nolan has chosen to piece the film together out of chronological order, sometimes whipping between pre- and post-bomb at a clip, switching from colour to black-and-white. It doesn’t make the narrative hard to follow, but instead, the frequent cutting doesn’t give scenes enough time to breathe, lessening their impact on the audience. Though decently well-paced, the climax of the film is undoubtedly the desert Trinity test of the bomb capabilities which is a standout moment. Arriving at around the two-hour mark, what makes this whole sequence of events stand out is that Nolan gives it time to build tension and unfold in front of the audience instead of time-hopping to the next scene. Oppenheimer is definitely worth the price of admission to see it on the big screen. It will undoubtedly be a player this awards season with Murphy getting some well-deserved recognition. But Nolan’s best? I’ll reserve that achievement for his future work. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 29, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” es una película formidable, caracterizada por un opulento estilo audiovisual, el despliegue espectacular de recursos cinematográficos (música, fotografía, efectos especiales, montaje), actuaciones notables y convincentes (a cargo de una pléyade de estrellas y talentos de primer nivel, incluso en roles secundarios), y una narración construida sobre la base del paralelismo y la simultaneidad a diversos niveles de sentido (tanto dramáticos como audiovisuales); todo con una intensidad que se aproxima al límite de lo soportable, pero consistente con el contexto histórico en el que transcurre la obra y la tarea encomendada al protagonista principal.  Dirigido por el gran director británico Christopher Nolan, el filme es un biopic con elementos de thriller judicial sobre Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), un famoso físico teórico estadounidense, considerado “el padre de la bomba atómica”. Lo presenta desde sus tempranos estudios universitarios en Cambridge hasta su nombramiento para dirigir la construcción en secreto de la fatídica arma (el Proyecto Manhattan) y las consecuencias que ello le acarreó. Pero este ámbito narrativo es solo el aspecto externo de su vida; al mismo tiempo, los complejos factores externos alimentan los internos. En esa línea, el director explora a fondo sus dilemas morales, procedentes de su vida privada y trabajo científico, los que se van acumulando hasta convertirse en uno central y el verdadero eje de la película. Nolan busca reivindicar la figura del ilustre científico y limpiarlo definitivamente de las falsas acusaciones de las que fue víctima durante la “cacería de brujas” en el macartismo, en la época de la Guerra Fría, debido a sus tempranas simpatías con el comunismo. Sin embargo, no llega a ser propiamente una cinta apologética, ya que –junto a la evidencia de su genio científico y profesional– se muestra con detalle sus defectos, errores, contradicciones e indecisiones finales; de tal forma que los factores internos, derivados de su personalidad, también provocan consecuencias en el ámbito externo, al más alto nivel. Cabe precisar que estas indagaciones –en las que se presentaban evidencias y se brindaban testimonios a cargo de testigos– no eran exactamente juzgamientos, sino entrevistas de carácter político en dos coyunturas distintas (la primera, durante el maccartismo y la segunda, posterior a ese periodo). Pese a que los interrogadores eventualmente utilizaban tácticas judiciales, en ambos casos no había “carga de la prueba” para la toma de decisión; sino que se trataba de evaluaciones políticas (la del Congreso, al ser propuesto Strauss como Secretario de Comercio por el presidente Eisenhower) o presuntamente referidas a seguridad nacional (en el caso de Oppenheimer en las audiencias ante la junta de seguridad). Entre estas dos líneas está la tercera (a manera de flashbacks), donde se cuenta prácticamente casi toda la vida adulta de Oppenheimer hasta sus actividades posteriores a la ejecución del proyecto Manhattan y el reconocimiento final durante el gobierno de Lyndon B. Johnson. Más aun, su biografía es desmenuzada con mucho detalle a través de estas indagaciones oficiales; una, la de la junta, destinada desacreditarlo y, la otra –congresal–, a evaluar la actuación de Strauss en relación con el proceso de la citada junta. Generándose una interacción constante en la cual los distintos episodios biográficos son introducidos, comentados, discutidos, evaluados y anticipados –ocasionalmente, desde más de un punto de vista– entre estas dos líneas narrativas hasta el mismo desenlace de la cinta.  Aunque la película es a color, toda la segunda línea ha sido filmada en blanco y negro, ya que aquí no solo se expone el punto de vista de Strauss, sino que también se sugiere el “lado oscuro” del entorno institucional, así como se muestra la transformación del personaje y, con ello, un importante giro argumental; y, más allá del punto de vista, se avanza hasta el propio clímax dramático de toda la obra. De tal forma que las dos líneas tipo interrogatorio –“incrustadas” a la tercera– son diferenciadas por la fotografía, aunque se terminan por integrar a esta última; es decir, son parte de una sola sucesión cronológica biográfica. En tal sentido, otro punto fascinante en esta estructura tripartita son los descalces temporales. La tercera línea empieza alrededor de 1920 y se desarrolla casi linealmente hasta 1963; mientras que la indagación de la junta fue en 1954 y la reunión del comité del congreso fue en 1959. No obstante, las tres están articuladas de forma casi cronológica por lo que en realidad todo transcurre linealmente, pese a que las dos pesquisas ocurren en años distintos.  De esta forma, sobre la estructura cronológica se monta otra estructura narrativa que retrocede del “futuro” (años 50, en distintos momentos) al “pasado” (años 20) para atrapar y desarrollar hacia adelante, en una maniobra de pinzas (léase acompañamiento e interacción narrativas), la acción y –luego del clímax– llevarla hasta el desenlace, en los años 60.  Toda esta compleja operación de sentido con los tiempos tiene como uno de sus objetivos extractar de la secuencia biográfica los dos episodios tipo interrogatorio y, dentro de este espacio fragmentado, plantear y resolver los dos grandes asuntos de esta película: el conflicto de personalidades entre Oppenheimer y Strauss (en el episodio congresal) y el dilema moral del protagonista principal (en las audiencias de la junta de seguridad). Para entender completamente el conflicto externo (con Strauss) y analizar el interno (del Oppenheimer), pasamos a examinar la tercera línea narrativa en el marco de esa única sucesión lineal. Estas tensiones se desarrollan de manera casi totalmente lineal durante el recuento biográfico, empezando por su paso por distintas universidades, sus relaciones con Einstein (Tom Conti) y otros físicos famosos (Niels Bohr / Kenneth Branagh, Werner Heisenberg / Mattias Schwaighöffer) y culminando con su nombramiento para dirigir el proyecto Manhattan e incorporación de los científicos para el proyecto.  Entre las tensiones externas sobre Oppenheimer tenemos las que se generan por sus relaciones y apoyo a iniciativas comunistas (en la academia y en el proyecto) y su lealtad a la autoridad militar y de seguridad estadounidense. Luego, las que surgen de su relación recurrente con su amante, la siquiatra Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), causadas por la enfermedad mental de ella; y, posteriormente, entre esta relación y las tensiones con su esposa, la bióloga Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt), por este y otros asuntos. Ambas fueron comunistas, así como su amigo Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall) y su propio hermano Frank (Dylan Arnold) a quien involucró directamente en “Trinity” (nombre clave de la prueba de la primera bomba atómica en el desierto de Los Alamos, New Mexico); lo que le generaría serios problemas, tanto entonces como posteriormente, aunque nunca se inscribió en el partido.  A estos se añaden los conflictos generados dentro del equipo del proyecto Manhattan, por la exigencia militar de secrecía y compartimentalización, y los obstáculos que ello planteaba para el trabajo científico interdisciplinario, el que requería forzosamente información compartida. Así como el debate sobre la bomba de hidrógeno con quien sería su creador, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) y con William Borden (David Dastmalchian); quienes ofrecerían testimonios decisivos ante la junta de seguridad. Para no hablar de las tensiones con el general Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), constructor del Pentágono y jefe militar del proyecto y otras, menores, en sus relaciones más puntuales con los científicos resueltamente opuestos a la bomba como Leo Szilard (Maté Haumann) y David Hill (Ramy Malek); entre otros. En consecuencia, lo que podría haber sido un soso recuento biográfico se convierte en una sucesión de secuencias repletas de relaciones fascinantes y episodios interesantes, sorprendentes y reveladores sobre el protagonista. Pero, sobre todo, estas tensiones –de personalidad, sentimentales, políticas, profesionales y científicas– están conectadas entre sí y crean una fuerte intensificación dramática, que solo se reduce tras el éxito de “Trinity”. Aunque, de todas maneras, alcanza para hacer tolerable y hasta potenciar los momentos de máxima presión en las audiencias de la junta de seguridad, hacia el final de la cinta. El encadenamiento de tensiones de todo tipo que mencionamos en el ámbito de la acción externa del protagonista se repite también –aunque de manera más limitada– en el ámbito interno; es decir, en la mente de Oppenheimer y se muestra a través de imagen y sonido. Lo que nos conducirá a un nuevo plano de sentido construido a partir del montaje y la banda sonora. De hecho, la primera imagen de la película pertenece a la tercera línea narrativa y es simbólica (como varias más y muy significativas), tanto en lo interno como en lo externo, impactando sobre la conciencia de Oppenheimer. Muestra la caída de unas gotas de lluvia y las ondas que genera en un arroyo; imagen que reaparecería al final del filme, simbolizando la posibilidad de una guerra nuclear, la que es representada –con sutileza– en otra imagen (alrededor de la mitad de la obra) que ilustra mediante las columnas de humo, las “crestas” de lo que sería tal hecatombe, todo entre nubes blancas sobre un cielo azul.  Aquí debemos mencionar el papel del montaje, pues ya hemos reseñado las constantes intercalaciones entre las tres líneas narrativas, a los que deben añadirse también los numerosos insertos del contexto científico (imágenes que pretenden ilustrar elementos de la física cuántica, fisiones y fusiones nucleares, y hasta los hallazgos del protagonista, referidos a la trayectoria de luz desde las estrellas) y de sus relaciones o consecuencias en el arte (“Tierra baldía” de Eliot, “Consagración de la primavera” de Stravinsky, cubismo por Picasso); estas últimas, además, informan sobre el interés (no desarrollado en el filme) de Oppenheimer por temas artísticos.  Más adelante, cuando logra el éxito en la prueba de la primera bomba atómica, empieza a ver desintegrarse a las personas que lo aplauden y celebran, como si fueran víctimas del artefacto nuclear; él mismo alucina que su pie está atascado en un cuerpo carbonizado por la explosión. Durante toda la película no hay una sola imagen que muestre la destrucción causada en Hiroshima y Nagasaki por obra de la bomba fabricada por Oppenheimer; en cambio, esas imágenes tormentosas estaban en su mente y no es casual que aparezcan con fuerza en sus momentos de mayor gloria y reconocimiento, marcando su quiebre emocional. Estas imágenes parecen (y son) obvias, pero no tanto. La película no desarrolla el hecho de que Oppenheimer padecía problemas mentales (fue diagnosticado por esquizofrenia a los 14 años y se conocen episodios de impulsividad seriamente agresivos). Nuevamente, la cinta no amplía estos asuntos, pero sí coloca estas escenas ambiguamente alucinatorias o el episodio con la manzana en Cambridge, que si bien no profundizan en estas facetas sí se correlacionan con los rasgos de personalidad del protagonista que se muestran en la cinta. No estamos, pues, ante insertos efectistas o barroquismo gratuito. Todas las imágenes están perfectamente justificadas, son momentos de un proceso narrativo audiovisual coherente y pleno de sentido, destinados a mostrar el fuero interno de Oppenheimer.  Pero también aparece, en conexión con esas imágenes iniciales de la física, el mito de Prometeo (en alusión al título de la biografía en la que está basada la película) y que relata cómo este titán inmortal roba el fuego a los dioses para entregarlo a los hombres y que estos se beneficien, siendo castigado por Zeus a vivir encadenado a una roca junto al mar y sufrir diariamente el ataque de un águila que le devora las entrañas. Como ser inmortal, Prometeo no podía morir y su carne se regeneraba durante la noche; volviendo al día siguiente el ave para devorarlo y reiniciar esta feroz tortura cotidiana.  Pero hay otros tres componentes cinematográficos fundamentales para sostener el trabajo de montaje. Uno es la banda sonora que –como en otras obras de Nolan– aporta un tono épico a la vez que amenazante a lo largo de todo el metraje. La monumentalidad y grandilocuencia de algunos fragmentos está totalmente justificada porque la música soporta un proceso creativo destinado a reconstituir, mediante la ficción, la verdad histórica sobre un hecho –además– trascendental para la humanidad.  De otro lado, la partitura de Ludwig Göransson es sumamente eficaz, en parte porque sigue los parámetros de Hans Zimmer, su antecesor en otras cintas de Nolan, pero también por momentos muy logrados; como, ejemplo, la tortuosa música que acompaña el siniestro diálogo entre el protagonista, el coronel Boris Pash (Casey Affleck) y otro oficial de inteligencia, en paralelo con otra conversa entre Oppenheimer y Grovers, al respecto. Este es un caso del magistral juego de varios puntos de vista –tres– en simultáneo, pero también de que al interior de la tercera línea narrativa se producen paralelismos adicionales a los de las dos primeras líneas (y algún cambio temporal).  De otro lado, el manejo de la dinámica en la banda sonora y el uso oportuno del silencio en esta cinta tan dialogada, en pared con similar procedimiento con las imágenes en el montaje trae un resultado audiovisual sobresaliente por su virtuosismo, consistencia narrativa, fluidez en el avance de la acción e interacción entre los ámbitos interno y externo de Oppenheimer. Esto nos conduce al segundo componente destacado en esta puesta en escena: el suspenso. Las numerosas tensiones, intensificación y conflictos dramáticos se potencian con las múltiples operaciones de sentido entre imagen y sonido en el montaje, siendo el resultado una sensación de suspenso casi permanente, que no da tregua al espectador y no lo suelta (sino que lo tiene atento, intrigado y excitado) hasta el final de la película. Aunque sabemos perfectamente que “Trinity” fue exitosa y que se produjeron efectivamente los ataques nucleares a Hiroshima y Nagasaki (y aún si no lo conociéramos), queremos saber cómo se llegó a eso, los entretelones de estas decisiones. Y lo mismo en relación con los múltiples avatares biográficos del protagonista.  La labor actoral de ambos intérpretes (y la del resto del reparto) es sobresaliente. Cillian Murphy, aparte de cambios físicos, consigue una caracterización muy lograda de la soberbia y carácter retraído del personaje; así como de su envidiable tranquilidad y fuerza para vencer obstáculos sobre la base de su genio e inteligencia (y cosechar, de paso, a una tropa de enemigos poderosos).  Pero también para mostrar las crecientes vulnerabilidades de Oppenheimer y su gradual declive emocional en las audiencias de la junta; hasta concentrar bajo la forma de un bloqueo, en el clímax del interrogatorio de la junta, los factores contradictorios en las que estuvo envuelta su vida y, especialmente, su gran logro: la bomba atómica.  Robert Downey Jr., por su parte, compone convincentemente a un Strauss sibilino, que se rinde ante la inteligencia de Oppenheimer pero es incapaz de superar su propia mezquindad (aunque también obedeciendo a intereses políticos); pero esto solo lo advertimos cuando –gracias al contraste de más de un punto de vista y en el bloque final– vemos un resumen de la sutileza con que el personaje encaja las varias afrentas involuntarias de su subordinado, un genio con carencias de inteligencia emocional, en distintos momentos.  Emily Blunt encarna a una mujer dura y endurecida por las frustraciones políticas y sus consecuencias posteriores, así como las personales, en relación (por épocas, tormentosa) con su marido; antes y después de la bomba. Aunque es fácil adivinar el trasfondo, uno se queda con las ganas de conocer más de Kitty, tal es la fuerza combativa que transmite la interpretación de la actriz.  Con la revisión de los principales componentes de esta puesta en escena ya podemos advertir su vasto alcance estético e histórico. Quizás lo más llamativo es cómo se cruza el avance casi cronológico de la acción con la fragmentación creada a través de los montajes paralelos y cómo la historia se va relatando por intercalación de diversos puntos de vista, muchas veces complementarios y/o de manera simultánea.  De tal forma que tenemos una narración lineal y fragmentaria a la vez, donde lo sincrónico (la sucesión de hechos y personajes, el auge y caída de Oppenheimer) convive con lo diacrónico (debates científicos, sospechas políticas y creciente dilema moral). Todo ello apoyado por un despliegue espectacular de recursos audiovisuales, que apoyan una estructura dramática perfectamente ensamblada, con harto suspenso y menos compleja que otras películas de este director.  En cierta forma, la imagen inicial de la película –las gotas de lluvia que producen ondas en un arroyo– no solo simboliza uno de los contenidos fundamentales de la película, sino también su propia estructura audiovisual. Así, las gotas serían las líneas narrativas paralelas, mientras que las ondas serían los distintos puntos de vista (en momentos y personajes distintos) que se intersectan. De tal manera que, aunque estemos siguiendo un relato lineal, al mismo tiempo, Nolan nos lo presenta como si estuviera ocurriendo en otros y muy distantes momentos, ¡y ambas cosas son ciertas! Estamos, pues ante una obra maestra cinematográfica, en la que podemos acceder y disfrutar una exhibición de virtuosismo audiovisual y dramático del más elevado nivel, así como un conjunto organizado de sentidos que nos devuelven un episodio histórico de vigencia en el presente y trascendencia para el futuro. Altamente recomendable.  Nota: Para quienes estén interesados en la supuesta competencia entre la Alemania nazi y los Estados Unidos para construir la bomba atómica, dato mencionado en la película, aunque no desarrollado e históricamente discutible, pueden leer “En busca de Klingsor”, la notable novela de  Jorge Volpi. Mientras que para el encuentro real entre Niels Bohr y Werner Heisenberg durante la guerra y en territorio controlado por los nazis, asunto materia de una fugaz mención, como posibilidad, en “Oppenheimer”, se puede visionar “Copenhagen”, película británica que ensaya una aproximación al tema de la competencia entre ambas potencias en torno a la bomba.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite filmmakers; his attention to detail, tone, acting, production sets, and sound is always a delight. “Inception” (2010), “The Dark Knight”(2008), “Dunkirk” (2017), and “The Dark Knight Rises”(2012) come to mind when I look back on his memorable films. He’s set the bar high for himself by tackling Robert Oppenheimer’s life as an experimental physicist who ended up creating the atomic bomb and taking the blame for its horrendous results. His casting of Cillian Murphy, known for “Peaky Blinders” British TV series 2013, was a brilliant choice as his nuanced performance is exceptional. I enjoyed this historical film immensely and have forgiven its three-hour run-time, as to have an up close and personal look at history in the making is indeed a treat. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Price-winning biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film unfolds in two separate ways; the black-and-white sections detail the ‘past’ struggles of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) in a fantastic portrayal, to be confirmed as Secretary of Commerce. He’s interrogated about his former support of Oppenheimer, who was controversial as of 1959. He would become the first candidate denied approval if his answers didn’t satisfy the Senate committee members. We are privy to his constant badgering and the seriousness of his past actions. The color sections show Oppenheimer’s life, most notably his torrid affair with Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his somewhat unsteady marriage to his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt). The development of the atomic bomb is the main focus, as well as his constant conflicts and alliances with Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (Matt Damon). We also learn of the building of a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where scientists will live and work while the bomb is perfected to test the bomb there eventually. The color and black and white scenes are flashbacks simultaneously as Oppenheimer is being interrogated by a special committee that will decide if his security clearance will be renewed. Yes, this is a lot to take in a while viewing a film, although soon, the pace allows for settling in with expectations of the following scenes. Of course, the cornerstone is the actual assembly and testing of the atomic bomb. The supporting cast gives an incredible performance, an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey, Jr. as Strauss departs from himself to totally embody his character. Florence Pugh’s role as the needy yet unstable other woman is fascinating to view. Yes, they have steamy love scenes, although they are important as we begin to see the conflicted moral compass of a genius, the total portrait of a human being. He has his hands full, appeasing his wife, Emily Blunt, as she’s scored yet, faithful, filling her anger and jealousy with binge drinking. Her volatile yet loving relationship with Oppenheimer is well-developed and intriguing to view. Nolan does achieve his goal of relentless ticking-clock suspense in how he approaches the movie overall. Each scene is played for full dramatic effect, especially in the race to build an A-bomb before Nazi Germany does. When the final test occurs, the sound is what stays with me—the stop-motion of history before us is chilling in his spot-on timing and visual effects. Look for an Academy Award for sound; no other movie can top it. As I have written and taught a unit of study of Albert Einstein and his contribution to the making of the atomic bomb, I appreciated the in-depth portrait of Oppenheimer, including his early beginnings in his college years. We are privy to his psyche and his personality as Nolan sets up scenes as if to dare us to predict how Oppenheimer will react. After three hours of viewing, you will understand this person and his drive for success. I can highly recommend it as you’ll learn a wealth of information while being artfully entertained.",POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2023"," Julius Robert Oppenheimer, quoting from Bhagavad Gita, made these words infamous when he uttered them. The theoretical physicist became known as the “father of the atomic bomb” after being the director for the Los Alamos Laboratory, which assisted with the Manhattan Project under Major General Leslie Groves during WWII. The bombs created led to the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer eventually feared the further creation and use of atomic weapons. His stances and past associations with Communist members led to the revocation of his security clearance, staining his character for some.  All of this and more is captured in Christopher Nolan’s 3-hour biopic Oppenheimer. It’s a mostly brilliant, occasionally exhausting picture that moves ten miles a minute and is filled with wall-to-wall dialogue. It is indeed Nolan’s most talky film, with the conversations often accompanied by Ludwig Göransson’s rich but overused music score. Nolan frames the film with Oppy’s security clearance meetings and a cabinet hearing for Lewis Strauss while detailing Oppenheimer’s personal life and the Manhattan Project at the center. The film covers a lot of ground, but Nolan’s intelligent writing (based on the 2005 book American Prometheus) and Jennifer Lame’s precise editing help ameliorate the more convoluted sections.  The cast of big-name stars is huge, with the great Cillian Murphy leading the way as the title character. His performance here ranks among his best as he shows Oppenheimer’s struggles and successes expertly. Murphy’s eyes do a lot of acting while the others’ mouths are moving.  Matt Damon plays Groves with some humorous touches while Emily Blunt plays Katherine, Oppenheimer’s alcoholic wife, with fierceness. Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, who Oppenheimer had an on-again-off-again relationship with. Robert Downey Jr. dominates the last hour of the film as Strauss, turning in the most memorable supporting performance in the film. The rest of the shiny cast includes – deep breath – Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Jack Quaid, Tom Conti, Alden Ehrenreich, Dane DeHaan, Gary Oldman, and Matthew Modine, just to name a few.  Being a Nolan film, the production aspects are very impressive. Oppenheimer was shot on IMAX 65 mm film by Hoyte van Hoytema and the film used little to no CGI according to Nolan. The images and practical effects are simply astounding at times, especially during the Trinity test scene; the sound design during that section is expertly done too as silence is as important as the boom. The subtle old-age makeup used throughout is also excellent.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC. You should check us out on our social channels, subscribe to our newsletter, and tell your friends.

"Aug 25, 2023"," Robert Horton is a Scarecrow board member and a longtime film critic. He will be contributing a series of ""critic's notes"" to the Scarecrow blog—a chance to highlight worthy films playing locally and connecting them to the riches of Scarecrow's collection. In the three-hour rush of Oppenheimer, writer-director Christopher Nolan takes time to include an early scene of the title character gazing at a Picasso. The painting (Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms, 1937) deconstructs reality and reassembles it in a fresh way, forcing us to think anew about its subject, perhaps confronting us with an assertion that the old ways of seeing are not enough anymore. Or, Picasso echoes quantum physics by breaking the image apart and exposing it as a collection of pieces. The nucleus no longer holds. We don't know what is going on in the head of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he gazes; the film wants us to understand that JRO responds to the fragmentation of early 20th century art, citing also The Waste Land and Stravinsky. Maybe he has the wistful yearning of a scientist who wishes he were an artist. I suppose it's too easy to pin this moment as autobiographical, but after all Nolan is a highly cerebral director of films that deconstruct cinema in clinical ways: a noir told backward, a World War II story that evolves in parallel but inexact lines, a story of manufactured dreams built like a nesting doll. Excited young cineastes like to call Nolan this generation's Stanley Kubrick, but he's really David Lean turned inside out, a master of spectacle, one who can't resist disassembling the pieces of the spectacle and pondering their individual parts. (And like Lean, the observations at the heart of the spectacle tend to be of the mid-brow variety.) The New Yorker's Richard Brody called Oppenheimer ""a History Channel movie,"" a puzzling description of a relentlessly experimental project.* Maybe Brody was thinking of the film's tendency to put its cinematic zest in service of some incorrigibly cornball moments (""What do we call the first atomic test?"" ""Let us call it … Trinity,"" or words to that portentous effect). Otherwise, Oppenheimer is shaped as an experience, an onslaught of sound and image and ideas, arranged musically. Although it has one very loud bomb going off halfway through, most of it consists of people talking in rooms, yet Nolan presents the film as a roller coaster ride, throbbing with Ludwig Göransson's score—which, with Nolan's usual cavalier attitude toward dialogue comprehension, thoroughly fuzzes what people are saying at various points—and darting in and out of color. Do we learn much about J. Robert Oppenheimer? Not really, not biographically, not spiritually. This is not the fault of Cillian Murphy, whose haunted eyes beneath the deftly-deployed hat were made for this kind of existentially conflicted role, although—and this is sheer historical prejudice on my part—I could never get used to seeing Oppenheimer as a short man; the real Oppenheimer's lanky tallness had to have been part of his rather lofty, dreamy personality. Oppenheimer is not a character study but a political film, a look at the back-and-forth of government process, from the building of the bomb to the security-clearance hearing that Oppenheimer had to endure in the 1950s when his leftist sentiments made him suspect during the Red-baiting era. In its structurally bizarre final hour, which crosscuts between Oppenheimer's security investigation and a later cabinet-appointment hearing for Oppie nemesis Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), Nolan gives us the American nightmare and a more upbeat example of justice being served, however obscure Strauss might now be as a historical figure. On the latter point, Nolan is surely catching the zeitgeist feeling/fantasy that something, at long last, might happen to the 45th U.S. president, something like accountability. I don't doubt that the energetic whoosh with which Nolan puts all this across is genuine excitement on his part about making these events come to cinematic life, although they are also more than a little exhausting. Oppenheimer might be less taxing if its points weren't so exactly and precisely worked out. With Nolan, things are on the nose, with only occasional spots of mystery and uncertainty (like the brief, dangerous intensity of Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's sometime girlfriend, or the suggestion from Niels Bohr [Kenneth Branagh] that Oppie should metaphorically ""hear the music"" rather than just read notation.) Even the film's excursions into expressionism, like a triumphal post-Hiroshima talk Oppenheimer gives to his Manhattan Project colleagues—where his can-do words contrast with visions of melting faces and nightmare sounds—are so carefully calculated that they have the exact meaning Nolan wants them to have, and nothing else. Nolan's style tends to reduce things to a simple idea, no matter how complicated his time-arrangements or aspect ratios are. Being able to articulate exact meanings isn't a negligible talent, and so the film is often engaging. The room where the security hearing takes place is one of Nolan's best conceptions, a weirdly cramped, rectangular, featureless chamber where the deck is stacked against the onetime American hero. Like the climactic scene in Barbie between doll and inventor (see, I found a way to connect the two films), the space is a pale sort of void, a purgatory. Here Oppenheimer will be grilled (mostly by an Atomic Energy Commission counsel, played by Jason Clarke) and defended (Macon Blair—such a human presence—is his attorney), his wife (Emily Blunt) will hear him talk about infidelities, and his wary military partner Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) will shun him as Oppie sits off to the side, disappearing in space. The room is like one of those places in your dreams where the dimensions are wrong, a recurring location of threat and confinement. There is so much on the table in Oppenheimer that Nolan's habit of settling for neat conclusions is especially disappointing. It is a noble try, an interesting experience, and an absolutely fascinating example of the director as superstar (a movie about a mid-century scientist had an $80 million opening weekend?!?). As to the post-opening-weekend comments that the film glosses over the effects of the bombing of Japan in favor of white man angst: It's tempting to say that those complaints are from people who didn't see the movie, except that in this era you can actually see the movie and still bend it to your purpose. No, there is no documentary footage of Hiroshima. And yet, Oppenheimer is deliberate about conjuring horror. During that aforementioned Oppie ""victory"" speech, there's a single tortured scream that cracks out of the audio mix, a hallucination that justifies Nolan's complicated sound design. It sears your brain. I said these three hours are exhausting, partly because they are so crammed with things, but ultimately there is blunt power in those things: equations, hats, screams.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2023"," Perhaps under slightly different circumstances, this would not have quite as volatile of a reaction. The announcement of two different, disparate movies would have just been an odd curiosity rather than a cultural phenomenon that would capture the imagination of tens of thousands. The juxtaposition was just too staggering. In one corner of the world, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenhiemer. His first movie in three years, an epic three-hour biopic about the creation of the atomic bomb. An in the other corner, Greta Gerwig’s Barbie. A live action fever dream whose trailers and promotional material seem to belie any sort of tethering with anything we’d ever known. And both of these movies coming out on the same day? July 21 was doubled marked from the get. But for some, myself included, this cosmic alignment, the cinematic syzygy meant only one thing. An fantatical film run. A double feature of the highest order I had done as an adult. Now, the history books (by which I mean the Wikipedia article), pormanteau’ed the names as Barbenheimer, a name I never quite agreed with because it did not reflect what I viewed the proper viewing order. As I planned the grueling gauntlet, I determined early on that the only correct approach would be to sit through the dark, harrowing existentialism of Nolan’s Oppenhimer and then immediately go into bubblegum pop existentialism of Gerwig’s Barbie as a form of cultural/experiential cold shock that would stagger me into an upswing. It was a bit, but a bit that I was committed to. I began prosteylizing the work. Trying to rally others to the theater for the deed. Many scoffed at the thought, but I convinced folks to undertake the journey that I felt my cause, my crusade noble. I sent word to my friends and associates (The marketing tools made this very easy). While I could not secure time to watch on the 21st, the 22nd would work just the same. A 10:30 showing of Oppenhiemer on the biggest screen I could find, followed immediately by a 2:10 showing of Barbie on a slightly smaller screen. I must warn you of what comes next now. There are spoilers in this text. Unknowable secrets that you could very well find knowable, but if I am to talk of the Oppenharbie, I must be able to talk free of what I witnessed. I managed to go in unadulterated with knowledge, but that was because of the temporal proximity. I imagine it might be more difficult now, but I do not wish to contribute to the demystification if it can be helped. AS FATE AS DEMANDED, THE DARK MAGNUM OPUS OF CHRISTOPHER NOLAN AND THE FEVER DREAM THAT IS LIVE ACTION BARBIE ARE COMING OUT THE SAME DAY.THE BIT I, AND THOUSANDS OF OTHERS, HAVE MADE SINCE THIS FORBIDDEN REVELATION IS COMING TO FRUITION. IT IS TIME TO SIT IN A MOVIE THEATER FOR SIX HOURS AND BE BOMBARDED IN SEVERAL SENSES OF THE WORD. I made the drive to the Alamo Drafthouse, a relatively new fixture in my hometown. The drive was uneventful, and I walked into the theater with perhaps a tad bit of glee at the wild undertaking. This particular Alamo Draftouse has an elaborate pre-show, so I sit in the massive theater. The experience starts with footage from various atomic bomb PSAs: times where we were informed that hiding under a desk could shield us from the effects of one of the worst weapons in human history. This is immediately followed by a base level analysis of Nolan’s entire library of works, cataloging various trends like TROUBLED PROTAGONISTS and trends like MEMORY and MORALITY. As I settled in the comfy recliner, I put in an order for a breakfast BLT, which is like a regular BLT but with an egg and fries. It’s pricy, but I figured that if there was ever a time to spend money it would be during a day where I am in a dark theater for upwards of six hours. I see a few people rocking Barbenheimer merchandise, a couple outfits melding bright pink and drab grey. I emboldened by having fellow travelers (although I do wonder how many are actively foolish as I am). The movie finally starts. In typical Nolan fashion, the narrative isn’t exactly linear. We start with Fission, a polychromatic journey that follows Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, and quickly are introduced to Fusion, a monochromatic political inquiry that follows Robert Downy Jr’s Strauss many years after the creation of the bomb. We bounce back and forth between these two eras that encircle a war happening off screen. I learn a fair bit about Oppenheimer during the movie. His political leanings, his womanizing tendencies, his preference to theory. It is the most exhilarating and harrowing story about scientists I’ve seen in a minute, with a cast of staggering renown bringing the story to life. All of it culminating to the test of the bomb. Nolan lets the explosion visual splendor revel in the silence. The sound comes minutes later and the film barrels through the political aftermath that follows, including a joke about Kyoto narrowly avoiding destruction because someone had their honeymoon there. The movie’s audiovisual bombardment leaves me emotionally raw. There are no end credits (or perhaps, I was already living in the post-credits of a post-nuclear globe), so I tip my server, collect myself, and then immediately walk to the other theater. The fugue state set in pretty much immediately as I settled into the second theater. The server asks how I’m doing and I relay that I just watched Oppenheimer. I recollect how I have certainly made a decision as I order a brussels sprout, bacon, and goat cheese pizza. This pre-show features what I have to imagine is every single Barbie commercial from the past 30 some years. It culminates with an aggressive doll doing a PSA about talking in the theater, and I’m not ready for what’s about to happen. I noticed a few folks from the Oppenhiemer showing; although at this point, I’m at hour three of sensory bombardment so I don’t know if I can trust my senses. Especially since what happens next is Barbie opens with the 2001: Space Odyssey spot, and I thought that was an incredible ad spot when I first saw, but to see it actually start the movie was something that shook me to my already shooketh core. I settle in for the gauntlet of Barbies (McKinnon, Rae, Shipp, Mackey, Nef, Rooney, Kayne, Ayra, Gouglan, Narrative, Abela, Boynton) and Ken (Gosling, Liu, Ben-Adir, Evans, Gatwa, Cena, Brydon, Stourton).  I enjoyed seeing so many members of Netflix’s Sex Education that I actively wonder where Asa Butterfield is. I enjoyed seeing America Ferrera as a Mattell employee and mom, desperately missing her as Amy from Superstore. Will Ferrell essentially reprising his roll from The Lego Movie is fine, that’s not really the point. I watched Michael Cera’s Allan absolutely destroy Kens in hand-to-hand combat. I burst out laughing as all the Kens play a rousing rendition of Matchbox Twenty’s 90’s classic “Push,” and the song creates a thousand new associations because of how it fits so perfectly and serves as a prelude to the other magnificent musical number. The story is simple and sweet. There is no room for deep nuance, but there is nuance. An acknowledgement of the contradictory standards, an everlasting fear of never being enough, and wanting more. As the movie ends, I smiled. I also struggled to stand after being stationary for five and half hours out the last six.  The sun was blinding as I exited the Alamo Drafthouse. The summer heat was sweltering. I walked slowly to my car and drive home in silence, thinking of the dual existentialism films that I put in conversation with each other, only to find a staggering amount of dialog of creation, capitalism, and human connection. I got home and was stunned, and in the fugue state, voraciously needed something to snap me back to a more tethered state. Thankfully, the universe provides, and Prime announced that ahead of the second season of Invincible, they released a special origin story for Atomic Eve. I was mesmerized by the moment, the sheer genius of releasing an episode of a pink haired protagonist with the ability to manipulating atoms the same day as Oppenhiemer/Barbie. It was clear though that was I was a changed person. Experiencing Oppenharbie had irrevocably changed me. I’m not sure I’d say either was my favorite movie, but I can say safely say it was one of the best cinematic experiences I’d ever done. Even got my own T-shirt for it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2023"," In a way, Christopher Nolan’s three-hour, shot-in-IMAX historical docudrama epic entitled Oppenheimer isn’t really about J. Robert Oppenheimer at all. Yes, even though it’s full of extreme closeups of the anguished scientist and much figurative rending of garments over his role in the creation of our modern world in which an atomic sword of Damocles hangs over us all. I mean, obviously, yes, the film does focus on the theoretical physicist, the man who led the United States’ secret program during World War II to develop an atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy (A Quiet Place: Part II, The Party) as the scientist is mesmerizing, conveying calamitous inner turmoil while remaining still and modulated on the surface, even when his lack of apparent reaction damages him. This can only be called a pointillistic portrait, one full of staccato visuals that hit rapid-fire but also somehow lazily, not least as Nolan switches from often intensely hued — indeed, fiery hued — color images depicting Oppenheimer’s subjective experience of his life and work, to cooler, calmer black-and-white to show the external, more objective reality in which he operates. (There’s a lot going on in this film, on so many levels, but I suspect entire theses will be written alone about the distinction Nolan makes here between personal emotional and intellectual experience as more vivid to the individual [obviously?] versus the drier, more distant, more neutral impartiality of everything outside of ourselves… and the limits of that, too, since it can only be cast through subjective eyes such as those of a filmmaker or a historian. This movie is a darker, grimmer, film-stock-flipped Wizard of Oz, and way more existential, dreaminess turned deadly actuality. Not that Oz didn’t have its own grimdark existentialism, of course.) Nolan (Tenet, Dunkirk) casts Oppenheimer as a man possessed by preternatural visions of the subatomic world, a strange reality that the mathematics says must exist but which he can see only in his imagination… and this is one of Nolan’s startling uses of IMAX. We’ve been trained to expect that IMAX pictures will capture the bigness of the world, but Nolan goes in the opposite direction here, zigzagging dots trailing light on the biggest movie screen we have suggesting the unfathomably minuscule realm far beneath our awareness. It’s like a buzzing in your ear of the universe’s tiniest unseen insects, hounding you to accept them even as you cannot comprehend them. (Nolan does go big with his pictures, too. His incredibly brief yet horrifyingly riveting impression of one worry that dogs the atomic scientists — would a runaway atomic reaction set off by a successful bomb ignite the planet’s atmosphere and Jesus fucking Christ they went ahead with it anyway — is perhaps the imagery that haunts me the most from the movie.) Yet as much as Nolan’s Oppenheimer is very much stuck in his own head, he can also be thoughtless and impulsive, giving in to urges without considering the consequences of them, from an itch to poison (what? yup!) a professor when he was at Cambridge university, to an ill-advised sexual situationship with a fellow pseudo-communist (Florence Pugh, goddess: Black Widow, Little Women) in the pre-war years, to a momentary lapse into wearing a military uniform that does not suit him in any way in the early days of the Manhattan Project. Nolan’s Oppenheimer can be very self-involved… to the point where you kinda wanna smack him out of it. Which his wife, played by a caustic Emily Blunt (Jungle Cruise, A Quiet Place: Part II) as a brilliant woman underappreciated by the world, almost literally does. (Ironically, or perhaps not, given his track record, Nolan underappreciates her character and the actress as well.) It comes in a moment where Oppenheimer is castigating himself for being, frankly, a huge jerk and suffering the consequences of this — in a personal capacity, not a military-industrial-scientific-complex one — and it’s almost the thematic centerpoint of the film. It’s echoed later, when in an astonishing one-scene cameo, Gary Oldman (The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard, Darkest Hour) as US president Harry Truman berates the physicist as a “crybaby” for feeling as if he had “blood on his hands” after Hiroshima. Truman was the one who dropped the bomb(s), after all: Oppenheimer only made the bombs. There is a paradox at the nucleus of Oppenheimer. I don’t think Nolan has any intention of suggesting that Oppenheimer shouldn’t have felt guilty or responsible for what his work led to. It is and would be only human for him, for anyone, to do so. (Indeed, Ludwig Göransson’s [Creed II, Black Panther] aggressive score and the film’s relentlessly belligerent sound design, not to mention the overwhelming impact of the IMAX visuals that are both intimate and epic, ensure that we feel in a visceral way how tormented Oppenheimer is.) And yet the film projects what could be seen as, at worst, disdain for Oppenheimer’s pity-poor-me martyrdom. At best, Oppenheimer is dismissive of the notion, which the man himself as depicted here seems to hold, that Oppenheimer is solely to blame for the horrors that his atomic-bomb project unleashed. Because once the possibility of an atomic bomb was conceived of, someone was going to make it happen, certainly in the context of World War II. The whole point of the Manhattan Project was to build a bomb before the Nazis did. (The deeper question of why we seem, as a species, constitutionally driven to find the most violent, most destructive uses of our scientific knowledge is a philosophical conundrum for another film.) Truman’s point is well taken: No matter who built the bomb, it would be, and was, the politicians who decided when, where, and how to deploy it. And boy howdy, the character who represents that side of the equation is a doozy. Although much in the same way that the film isn’t really about Oppenheimer, it’s also not really about this other major figure either: Lewis Strauss, a former (as of 1959, the present-day of the film) Atomic Energy Commission head vying for a seat in US President Eisenhower’s cabinet. The film is structured as a series of nested flashbacks around Strauss’s confirmation hearings in the US Senate, which involve Oppenheimer because of the publicly and politically contentious professional relationship the men shared. Robert Downey Jr (Avengers: Endgame, The Judge), in his finest and most interesting performance since before Marvel, plays Strauss as a shallow, grasping functionary unaware of how absolutely useless he is, a contrast to Oppenheimer’s profound intellectualism but also a complement to the scientist’s self-involvement: Strauss is just as focused on himself as Oppenheimer is, if with far less self-awareness about it. Nolan mines extraordinary suspense from a simple exchange between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti: Paddington 2, The Dark Knight Rises) that Strauss witnesses but cannot overhear, during which Strauss believes Oppenheimer must have said something that soured Einstein on Strauss, because everything went to shit for Strauss after that, and what other reason could there be? (This leads directly to one of the many tiny, unsettling zingers of the film, a bit of snark from Alden Ehrenreich’s [Solo: A Star Wars Story, Hail, Caesar!] aide to Strauss about that mysterious exchange. Such an amazing ensemble cast in this film! Entire theses will be written about that, too.) When we at last hear that conversation — this final flashback is the closing scene of the film — it’s shocking for what is said, and also for what isn’t. It’s here when what Oppenheimer is about hits hard, and it is, once again, paradoxical: With the power to destroy ourselves unleashed — not just nukes but global warming, possibly AI, maybe genetic engineering, probably lots of other potential nightmares — how such awesome capability is used goes far beyond the acts of any one person, even the self-centered, self-involved men who think they make the world go round. And yet, when enough of them get together, even in opposition to one another, the tragedy is that they might actually make the world stop. Really well written review of the amazing and clearly Oscar worthy Oppenheimer, There is however one glaring oversight and that is the main deleterious motivation behind the creation of the bomb and that is  Male Hubris. I think this is truly the kingpin of this movie. Men cannot create life so they get off on destroying it! This is what all these male scientists in an almost collective orgasm demonstrate when the first bomb trial goes off! It is so hard to watch! There is only a brief view of two people throwing up but all the others are simply in a state of euphoria!! The few women, his lovers, in the film are the only ones that seem to fully comprehend the human ramifications. All the others just see male glory and male power! The male hubris at the basis of this destruction always has calamitous ramifications as Einstein so clearly states in the last scene! We Are All Doomed! I’d offer that the problem at its heart is capitalism, the military industrial complex, and on a more big picture scale, the problem is our society’s constant aspirations for affluence.
Both men and women, in my experience, put a good life in material terms far ahead of any concern about consequences like climate change or nuclear war. If particular men bear the blame for specific actions, that’s one thing, but our species does not seem to know restraint, regardless of gender.  Consider how Julian Assange and Edward Snowden are men, but Hillary Clinton was quite happy to see them prosecuted, and the military industrial complex enriched, during her time as Secretary of State. The US govt bureaucracy doesn’t care whether it’s Biden or Harris or Obama as the figurehead, just that American financial, political and military dominance across the world is maintained. That’s really what this animosity towards China and Russia, and the conflict and sanctions that’s resulted, is about. When I saw the trailer for Oppenheimer I immediately thought of its timing, during the Ukraine war, and potential for NATO vs Russian conflict. There’s very little if any discussion in the media about peace negotiations and ending the conflict. Do you ever wonder why that is? The US military-industrial complex consumes about $1 trillion (half of federal discretionary spending) and it would be fine with a forever war of the models of Iraq and Afghanistan: War is a business, and politics is the business of power, of which war, and weapon making, is a part. Living in Europe, I can assure you that there are many, many reasons for the lack of peace negotiations. A prominent one is that the Russian government would not accept them, unless Ukraine surrenders completely – nor would Ukraine, for obvious reasons. Unless the Russian notion changes completely, there will be no end of the conflict, and with Ukraine being harrassed like that, by now there is no certainty the war would end even if Russia retreated, from my point of view.
With some of us having the Russians literally at our doorstep, should Ukraine lose the war, there are still many people in Europe who don’t want negotiations on Russian terms, either.
Even though I completely agree with you with respect to the US military industrial complex , the war in Ukraine still is one in which the US have no say about whether to end it or not.
Or in other words, the US military industrial complex is not the only instance in the world waging war on someone. Even if they lost interest in this conflict completely, fighting would ensue, ad the parties involved have their own agenda, each. Marge, I have to respectfully disagree. There’s much evidence showing Russia’s desire for peace negotiations. In April 2022, just a month into the fighting, there were peace talks in Turkey that ended after UK’s Boris Johnson visited Zelensky: an agreement was being reached at that time.
Russia’s main demand is that Ukraine be neutral, not part of NATO, but Ukraine is repeatedly promised NATO membership.  If you believe Russia is the threat, not the US, I have to respect that. I would ask to you consider how honest mainstream media is, and also the history of the Maidan revolution (2014), the Minsk agreements (to stop civil war in the Donbas), and US involvement in that. It is not an accident Biden and his son Hunter are implicated in a corruption scandal with Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas corporation. Also, consider why were the Nord Stream pipelines bombed? Europe now has to depend partly on expensive liquid natural gas from the US, and German industry is re-locating outside the country: Europe is being de-industrialized by the loss of Nord Stream. Russia, in partnership with Europe and China represents an economic union that the US wanted to eliminate. Oh dear, I feel like now I understand why Caitlin Johnstone speaks to you. “Russia’s desire for peace negotiations”? Russia invaded a sovereign nation. If Russia wants peace, it can withdraw from the sovereign nation it invaded. In fairness, I mentioned Caitlin more for her (few) articles dealing with existential crises while not closing ourselves off to the world’s beauty. My views on Russia are different, shaped by my knowledge of the Maidan, the 2015 civil war in the Donbas and US foreign policy (Libya, Syria, Yemen, Ukraine, etc), and not mainstream media. Great review, MaryAnn : I specifically like you pointing out the use of IMAX to go small instead of go big.
Early in the film Oppenheimer (I think when he’s trying to convince Josh Hartnett – what a cast indeed! – to join him) says something like “we know the Nazis are going to build it so we have to do it first, it’s the only choice,” a sentiment you have highlighted. I was just *vibrating* in my seat, wanting to yell at them “No! You don’t have to! It would be enough to keep them from doing it!!” and I think the film, while really doing an incredibly moving job of grappling with Oppenheimer’s conflicted feelings about the bomb’s use, never quite grapples with that conclusion being a foregone one.
That said, I thought this film was more or less magnificent, and appreciate your writing on it. oh Heavens I haven’t the slightest clue. If they knew it was happening, and they knew where (which I think they did..?), I struggle to think they could not have spent at least some effort on trying to disrupt the progress, rather than make it a race. This is idealistic and pacifistic of me and I know, but heavens do I wish de-escalation was a more valued trait throughout American history and culture.

There’s a whole discussion about how he’s not a member of the party, etc. I can’t recall now why I included Tatlock in that description — isn’t there also some talk about how she wasn’t as committed as she might be? The quibble is that Jean Tatlock wasn’t a “pseudo-Communist.”  Unlike Oppenheimer, she was a an active, committed member of the Party.  Unlike Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty or his brother Frank, she never left it. The more substantial comment is that Strauss shouldn’t be dismissed as merely a “shallow, grasping functionary.”  He was a talented man who had worked for Herbert Hoover in the emergency food relief program after World War I, turned that into a job as an investment banker, and made a fortune on Wall Street before and during the Depression.  He was a reserve Navy officer who oversaw all war production for the Navy Department in World War II and wound up an admiral.  Though a Republican, Harry Truman put him on the Atomic Energy Commission.  Ambitious and insecure, Strauss was smart enough to recognize men who were smarter, and he longed to be recognized as one of them.  Like Salieri, his dramatic equivalent, or like Nixon, he was a B+ striver who desperately wanted to be an A and envied and resented men of genius who achieved effortlessly what he could never attain through sweat and cunning.",POSITIVE

"Aug 22, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” is so stuffed -- with historic information, blue-chip actors and cinematic techniques -- you wonder if it even belongs in the same breath as other films released this year. In the biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” he details the distractions the physicist had from multiple sources as he worked to unlock the weapon’s secrets. Oppenheimer (played with great poise by Cillian Murphy) didn’t just have political opponents, he had nagging insiders who could have spilled the secrets to any number of enemies. Keeping a lid on the build, dubbed the “Manhattan Project,” was often the least of his worries. On the homefront, he had a feisty, forthright wife (Emily Blunt) and a needy mistress (Florence Pugh) who had the ability to steal his focus. In the hastily built Los Alamos (where scientists were united to craft the bomb), he had a deadline-crazy general (Matt Damon) and a phalanx of experts who demanded his attention. Murphy handles it skillfully (Damon isn’t quite as controlled) and gets his project underway. Then, it’s a matter of ensuring it won’t destroy those creating it. Throughout the mission, Nolan switches to scenes with Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, chair of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Nominated for a cabinet post, Strauss tries to sully Oppenheimer’s reputation in order to build his own. Shot in black-and-white, the hearing and confirmation scenes represent the dismantling of Oppenheimer. The color shots show what happened outside the process. Folded into all of it, of course, is the thought that the man could be a Communist, working for interests other than the United States. The witch hunt ties nicely with the statements Nolan makes about politics and its role in the arms race. Oppenheimer talks with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) at one point and learns what he has to lose. It’s a telling scene that confirms games have always been played in Washington. When Oppenheimer and company test their bomb, Nolan builds tension by using sound and light to underscore the moment. Step by step, you witness areas where the film could be the leading contender for Academy Awards. There are so many supporting actors of note (it’s like an indie director’s dream team), you’ll wonder who will emerge from the pack. Downey is obviously a standout -- at times it’s impossible to recognize him under the makeup and gestures -- but there are also smart turns from Alden Ehrenreich, Dylan Arnold and Damon. Subtly, we see Oppenheimer age. The makeup effects are first-rate, aiding Murphy in his process. While he isn’t a flashy actor, Murphy displays plenty of emotion on his gaunt face. It’s not difficult to see the wheels turning. When he’s greeted by his team following its victory, life becomes a blur. Like the bomb, there’s plenty of flash, indistinguishable sound and a sense of dread. Like “The Candidate,” the moment has an “oh, no, what have I done?” feel. If you removed all the daredevil stunts Tom Cruise does in “Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning, Part One,” you’d have a nifty little 90-minute film.",POSITIVE

"Aug 16, 2023"," Much like Barbie, there's probably not a ton to be said about Oppenheimer at this point, except to say that it's every bit as good as people are saying. Still, I'm going to take a run at it. What stands out most about Oppenheimer is how much it's both very much a Christopher Nolan film and quite a radical departure for him. Yes, loads of the old Nolan tropes are present and accounted for: multiple timelines, an epic scope, trouble writing female characters, practical effects shot on IMAX cameras, a booming and intentionally over-stuffed soundtrack, and of course, Cillian Murphy, finally taking centre stage.  On the other hand, it's a fairly straightforward film that's very much a mix of pure biopic and, essentially, courtroom drama that consists mostly of people talking in rooms. And by ""people"" I do mostly mean men - this was the 1940s, after all. It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done. And yes, it's also the first of his films to feature nudity and/ or sex, but it's a sex scene as only Christopher Nolan would do it, as mid-coitus, Florence Pugh's character dismounts to pick up a book written in Sanskrit and incorporates it into the action - with the immortal words, ""I am become death, destroyer of worlds"" acting as basically the, um, climax of the scene. Either way, some may miss the Nolan-ness of Nolan's latest film, but after the undeniably creative but ultimately crushingly disappointing Tenet, going back to basics was a move that very much paid off. Not that he needed to go too far as the film that preceded Tenet was the historical war film, Dunkirk. Even then, though, Dunkirk still shared a certain coldness to it, a lack of interest in its characters, that prevented me from ever coming close to loving it. Unsurprisingly, Oppenheimer has a ludicrously impressive cast, with yet another familiar face popping up every few minutes, but crucially, even the smallest parts - and there are loads of small parts - have enough character to them that you understand why so many stars and excellent character actors showed up even just for a couple of minutes of screen time. And after playing pretty much no one but Tony Stark for a decade, it's a real pleasure to see Robert Downey Jr get the chance to really cut loose here and remind us how great and versatile an actor he really is. Even the film's two ""main"" female characters make a serious impact with their limited screen time and undeniably thinly drawn characters. All joking aside, though I do understand why people view Florence Pugh spending much of her screentime in the buff as purely gratuitous, it seems pretty apparent to me that this was done to draw a contrast between Oppenheimer's two loves. And, yes, this is a cheat, but it does genuinely put Pugh's character's emotional rawness in stark contrast to Emily Blunt's character's literally buttoned-up stoicism.  No matter how great the supporting cast are, though, this film belongs entirely to the eponymous Robert Oppenheimer and to Cillian Murphy's spectacular, sure-to-be-award-winning performance of this enormously complex historical giant. Aside for Peaky Blinders, he has spent much of the past decade in small supporting roles, so there's something particularly gratifying about his performance here, which is, in part, pure leading-man charisma and in part, nuanced and deep character-acting. This is a historical drama about the development of the atomic bomb, certainly, but more than anything it's about what being the driving force behind the weapons that would kill thousands in Nagasaki and Hiroshima and set the groundwork for a potential nuclear holocaust, would do to the psyche of its creator. Especially because there is such a convincing argument that it was a necessary evil to prevent Germany from build its own atomic bomb and to finally and definitively defeat a Japan unwilling to surrender the war - or at least so it seemed at the time. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 15, 2023"," Biographical drama starring Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt. During the Second World War, American physicist J Robert Oppenheimer and fellow scientists race against time to develop an atomic bomb before the Nazis. But, during the 1950s Red Scare, his name is dragged through the mud by US officials. The physicist who oversaw America's race to develop the atom bomb before the Nazis is the beating heart of director Christopher Nolan's spectacular, Oscar-winning depiction of world-changing history. Cillian Murphy gives a stunning performance as J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed ""the father of the atomic bomb"", and he's supported by an awesome array of talent, including Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh (as the women in his life), Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. The three-hour running time and scientific jargon demand patience, but Nolan's marriage of visuals and sound design is often dazzling, not least during the tension-filled detonation of the prototype device. Oppenheimer's postwar battle with authorities over his politics also features, and the fusion of these intersecting narratives delivers a dramatically explosive climax. But it is Murphy's haunting turn, often conveyed in unsparing close-up, that anchors this beautifully cinematic epic.",POSITIVE
"Aug 11, 2023"," Finished the 2023 edition of Fantasia Festival with fifteen titles of varying success (only two really didn’t work for me). RIVER was my favorite. APORIA and WITH LOVE AND A MAJOR ORGAN follow closely behind. All in all another great dive into genre films with a festival that never disappoints. I also finally caught up to OPPENHEIMER: a great feat, albeit probably not a Top Ten feature for me. Figured it’d be the first of the BARBENHEIMER behemoth to be pulled from screens due to its runtime. So, here’s hoping I can catch BARBIE in the next couple weeks too. Time will be tight, though, as TIFF is coming right around the corner. Already received my first screener despite the full schedule not being released until 8/15. When tragedy strikes the Osawa family on a day marked for celebration, neither Taeko (Fumino Kimura) nor Jirô (Kento Nagayama) quite knows what to do. They should be able to grieve together. They should be able to look into each other’s eyes. And yet they simply stare off into the distance, going through motions as numb, hollow husks searching for some sign of life while trying to avoid showing too much. Because it’s difficult to know exactly where they stand. Despite being married for a year now, they still find themselves at a distance due to the circumstances surrounding their relationship. Taeko was married once before and had a six-year-old son (Tetta Shimada’s Keita) before Park (Atom Sunada) ran away. Jirô was engaged (to Hirona Yamazaki’s Yamazaki) when he began his affair with her. Add the fact that his parents (Misuzu Kanno’s Myoe and, especially, Tomorô Taguchi’s Makoto) can’t quite wrap their heads around their son marrying a divorcee and forcing them to be grandparents to a grandchild that “isn’t theirs” and you can begin to see how fragile things already were. In another filmmaker’s hands, LOVE LIFE would probably be full of fireworks as this married couple comes to grips with what happened by distancing themselves even further while moving closer to those former loves from their pasts. This would probably be the case if it was set in many places besides Japan too. But that’s what makes Kôji Fukada’s drama so powerful. The silences where steely frustrations and unavoidable embarrassment are left unsaid really speak to the struggle these characters face moving forward. Because everything intimated and refuted about their love does exist. And how they react to those truths could shatter everything they’ve built. So, don’t expect things to get blown out of proportion. Don’t assume Park or Yamazaki are going to use the situation to get back together with Taeko and Jirô respectively. Jealousy isn’t what Fukada is interested in pursuing. He’s focusing upon forgiveness instead. Not for the other’s transgressions or unspoken feelings, but for themselves. Can Taeko forgive herself for stopping to look for Park? Can Jirô forgive himself for breaking Yamazaki’s heart? Can their shared nightmarish plight get Makoto and Myoe to finally realize the pettiness of their cold shoulder to support the family given to them rather than lament the loss of the one they always wanted? And there’s the need to forgive themselves for the spark to this emotional upheaval. Taeko blames herself. Jirô feels guilty for selfishly breathing a sigh of relief when he should have been mourning. The circumstances are obviously heightened, but the result is a resonant and universal sense of what living with and loving someone else entails. It’s never easy. It’s always complicated. And you will ultimately make mistakes. But the thing you cannot do is run from the inevitable fallout or avoid the truths that exist in your heart. Because it’s not about what you did to let shame prevent you from looking your partner in the eyes. It’s about looking there anyway. Kimura shines in the lead role. Her strength to call out Jirô’s father when he goes too far or push Park for answers when he suddenly comes back into her life mixes with a justified anger for having to deal with both at all that provides a palpable baseline for who she is and the decisions she’ll soon make. Because Taeko will do anything for the people she loves. She doesn’t absorb these slights for herself, but to protect those who are inevitably caught in the crossfire through no fault of their own (Keita as a symbol of her former marriage, Park as a deaf Korean immigrant, etc.). It’s a commendable feature of her love and an unfortunate opening that leaves her vulnerable. The film is a series of events wherein Taeko and Jirô are let down by each other and themselves. It’s about the ways in which they contort themselves so as not to actually talk about what has happened or what they’re truly feeling—leaving them susceptible to being hurt further by the need to fill in the blanks, conjuring their own assumptions instead. They turn away rather than towards to confront their fears elsewhere, leaving their genuine love in a purgatory that may never relinquish it. The question is therefore whether they can remember they’re no longer alone. It’s a tale of two trials. Except, of course, that neither half is a trial—a fact those presiding over both events are quick to stipulate whenever the accused (or party at threat of being “denied”) dares to call their tactics out for being unjust. One sees J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) appealing the revocation of his security clearance years after stewarding the invention of the atomic bomb. The other finds Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) seeking a cabinet appointment. Both prove that even the most cautiously optimistic belief that any nation on Earth might handle the responsibility of nuclear power was simply naïveté. That’s what Christopher Nolan’s OPPENHEIMER (adapted from the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin) is really about. Not how the titular character changed the world in Los Alamos. Not his life as a womanizing prophet of theoretical quantum physics. No, it’s about the reality that the bomb was a symptom (albeit much more than that to those impacted at Hiroshima and Nagasaki) of the prevailing international military industrial complex rather than its catalyst. What should have been a deterrent to war merely became the next tool to ensure we’d never see a period of time without a war raging again. It’s a sobering thought that ultimately haunts Oppenheimer from the moment we first meet him out of time. There he is as a student at Princeton, unable to sleep with the sound and fury of death and destruction roiling through his brain. There he is at a table in a tiny room being grilled by an over-zealous prosecutor (Jason Clarke’s Roger Robb) at the behest of an “impartial” tribunal, unable to fully hear his words above the sensorial overload of terror for what his science wrought. But none of that is present to earn sympathy from us or to prove an admission of guilt. It’s a deflection from what’s really going on. A reminder that intent is meaningless in the face of ambition. Because the truth of what Nolan weaves through flashbacks sparked by the testimonies of both Oppenheimer and Strauss is that it’s all been a game. Those who believe themselves to be in control are merely puppets for the ones who are. The difference is that Oppenheimer acknowledges this fact. He knows Admiral Groves (Matt Damon) picked him because he was a liability. Because he had everything to lose and thus one hand perpetually tied behind his back. He may have been arrogant, but he wasn’t vain. Not like Strauss—a man so wrapped up in the strings he’s pulling that he forgets about the ones tightly affixed to his own wrists. At three hours long, however, we aren’t able to fully grasp this notion until we’re already two-thirds of the way through thanks to “surprise” revelations that prove cuter than they do profound. Does shielding the real reason Nolan has chosen these mirrored “trials” add anything to the whole? No. The impact of what we watch beforehand doesn’t grow out of the reveal. Only the impact of what follows does. So, why not play it straight from the beginning? Why toy with the audience’s expectations? Because that which does follow pales in comparison to the rest. It serves to create a villain. And, in so doing, removes us from the weight of Oppenheimer’s grief to enjoy a romp of karmic “justice” instead. Don’t get me wrong, though. Downey Jr. is absolutely fantastic and I love his more direct plot line to an eventual comeuppance. I’m just not sure it doesn’t take away from the potency of the more introspective and esoteric Prometheus tale at the film’s center. That’s why I must step back and view the whole as being about more than these men. To see Nolan’s goal as proving they were both pawns to a changing tide of bloodlust and tribalism wherein World War II became less about finding allies to fight for a common cause and more about aligning with enemies to cheat, steal, and cut loose once the bigger threat to both was defeated. That’s where the communist angle comes in and why all those tertiary characters (including Florence Pugh drastically underused Jean Tatlock) must be introduced despite being throwaways who cannot earn the emotional gut-punch Nolan wishes they can. Jean, the Chevaliers, even Oppenheimer’s brother are pawns to his story like he’s a pawn to that of the United States’ demand for supremacy. It all becomes fodder for Roger Rob to wield as Ludwig Göransson’s score ramps up to climax. So much so that even the wonderful scene where he gets taken to task by Emily Blunt’s Kitty (an actor elevating another weakly written prop to almost feel real) becomes a victim to Nolan’s too-smart-for-his-own-good shell game. Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he’s finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars. Check my blood pressure after the latest PTSD-fueled flashback hits Oppenheimer while he attempts to be what is wanted of him even as he wishes to retreat. Bask in the narrative parallels by looking back to see where the manipulations were coming from even if the need to do so feels unnecessarily convoluted. Much like my reaction to Paul Thomas' Anderson’s THERE WILL BE BLOOD, OPPENHEIMER is objectively a monumental work by an artist at the peak of his ability. I just prefer Nolan’s messier swings wherein heart and excitement trump his obvious technical prowess. Ryland Brickson Cole Tews and Mike Cheslik’s LAKE MICHIGAN MONSTER earned its cult following with a DIY aesthetic and madcap absurdity that I respected more than I enjoyed. It was fun. A title I’d recommend being seen by those who already have an inclination rather than one I’d enthusiastically demand be viewed sight unseen. So, I won’t lie and say I didn’t approach their follow-up HUNDREDS OF BEAVERS with slight trepidation. Or that my discovering it was a whooping 108-minutes long didn’t make me cringe at the thought of going comatose once the joke went stale. But while this live-action LOONEY TUNES epic of silent-era slapstick nonsense is definitely too long (I admittedly took a critical break around the hour mark), it proves itself to be a vast improvement over its predecessor by fully leaning into the madness until you can’t help reveling in its charm. The story follows a hapless apple whiskey purveyor named Jean Kayak (Tews) who gets too sloshed on his own wares to realize an influx of beavers have been munching on every piece of wood in the forest. Fast-forward to the third verse of the opening song and Jean finds himself destitute and dry in the freezing cold, his apple trees and distillery burnt to a crisp. A few circuitous gags later, whereby he attempts to keep warm and find food, puts Jean onto the trail of a master trapper (Wes Tank), a cantankerous shopkeeper (Doug Mancheski), his furrier daughter (Olivia Graves), and a native trader (Luis Rico). Gleaning what he can from their comings and goings, he eventually becomes a trapper himself with dreams of killing enough rabbits, beavers, and wolves to buy a good coat, get his own rifle, and marry the only woman in this war zone of conniving creatures regardless of her father loathing his very existence. Cheslik (who directs) and Tews (who co-writes with him) pretty much put forth a series of skits wherein Jean is brutalized by his would-be animal victims in ways that teach him how to later brutalize them instead. He uses that unintentional education to lay the foundation for a Rube Goldberg-esque master plan of food pyramid violence that he knows can win him his prize. And all the while the beavers continue building a bunker that houses dastardly plans of their own. It’s a humorous ride in lo-fi yet impeccably crafted compositing between live action and animation for quick-witted Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote action—with a few Bugs Bunny versus Elmer Fudd shenanigans thrown in. Mostly silent besides grunting, the scenes between humans (namely Jean, the Furrier, and her father) homage Chaplin/Keaton antics while the decision to have all the animals played by people in mascot costumes lends a surreally inspired dynamic of nightmarishly comic proportions. That it all leads to a finale you cannot even begin to imagine is both its best and worst feature. Because despite it making the ride worth any pacing bumps, it also reveals just how berserk things could have gone much, much sooner. Yes, the ways in which Jean and the animals attack each other escalate in their idiocy as time passes. But it’s still just them trying/failing to kill each other again and again. Those first two-thirds desperately need more variety and WTF details like a Beaver Sherlock and Watson. Setting up what’s coming with intent (and a much defter hand than you might assume while watching) only matters if your audience remains awake for the payoff. If not for my makeshift intermission, I might not have been. But I’m glad I was since its conclusion really is unforgettable. Elsa (Sonya Walger) has ALS. Diagnosed six months ago, her symptoms have reached the point of affecting her job—a job that’s intentionally shrouded in secrecy at the start of John Rosman’s NEW LIFE. We glean details (sparse apartment, handgun, and Tony Amendola’s mysterious handler Raymond visiting with a new assignment), though, and conclude she’s either a CIA operative or assassin despite it not really mattering. It should matter. The fact it doesn’t is the main reason I could never let the story wash over me and the core of why it fails to live up to its potential. Because although the movie is very much Elsa’s story, she isn’t the “lead.” She’s neither the first person we meet nor the presumed protagonist. We are conversely conditioned to hope she fails. So, suddenly pushing her into the “hero” role halfway through ultimately destroyed what was left of my good will. Not because she shouldn’t be the hero or that her trajectory doesn’t illustrate the overall message Rosman is trying to convey, but because he undercuts the effectiveness and necessity of both to facilitate an empty twist. We meet Jessica (Hayley Erin) first instead. Distraught, covered in blood, and running for her life towards home. She washes up, finds a change of clothes, and discovers the engagement ring her boyfriend never gave her before realizing two men with guns have entered the house. Escaping through a window she finds herself stowing away in the backs of strangers’ cars, eventually meeting a kindly older couple willing to help. The assumption we make (as well as anyone who encounters her and her black eye) is that Jessica is on the run from violence. That she cannot divulge too many details because trusting the wrong person could be the difference between life and death. Add Elsa’s activation on her crosscut parallel pursuit and we presume it’s true. Jessica either did something or saw something that a deep-pocketed entity can’t let become public knowledge. So, she becomes our focus. She becomes the character we pull for regardless of Elsa’s own tragic backstory. Flipping the script doesn’t therefore excite us. It frustrates. I don’t want to give too much away, so I’ll try to keep plot specifics to a minimum beyond admitting Jessica is a MacGuffin. It doesn’t matter that we spend two-thirds of the runtime following her isolated path or that the film asks us to sympathize with her plight. Her true purpose is to set Elsa’s wheels in motion. How can you not then wonder what might have been if Rosman simply let that be the case? What if he wrote this script as Elsa’s story wherein Jessica is merely her current case instead of pretending as though her existence is on the same level of importance first? I don’t think it fundamentally changes a thing when looking back with hindsight. Maybe the first half isn’t as mysterious as it is now, but the second half wouldn’t be nearly as manipulative either. Because we would know where we stand with the characters. We would give Elsa our weight and Jessica our pity. The latter can still have pathos. Her progress can still be about not taking life for granted. It would simply transparently do so for the benefit of the former. Because we also don’t know what movie we’re in due to the subterfuge. Not truly. NEW LIFE’s start and finish are on completely different wavelengths. Yes, it’s cool and superficially effective, but it proves to be for naught the second that shift undermines the overall package. It’s too bad too since the much more horror-infused second half is memorable in its thrills and special effects. It’s also a shame because Walger delivers a fantastic performance that deserves more time and intent to let its third act revelations breathe and earn its emotional gravitas—gravitas the filmmaking thinks it has already. I get the desire to make things more complex and twisty, but the script needs to be airtight for such devices to truly excel. It can’t make you feel as though it led you on only to provide a “gotcha” that renders more of what we’ve seen inconsequential than it augments. There’s an intriguing concept here as far as using the idea that ALS is like being a prisoner in one’s own body. That’s a thought that justifiably conjures fear, especially for those who don’t need to accept the reality themselves. I just think the finished product uses it as a gimmick rather than a lesson. As the current climate evolves into increased violence, the future setting of Robert Hloz’s RESTORE POINT delivers a solution. It’s a technology that provides a way to revive those whose time to die was forced upon them by another. As long as you remember to download a back-up of your consciousness and memories, the taxpayer-funded institute led by Dr. Rohan (Karel Dobrý) can bring you back. His machine restores your body of its wounds before uploading your save file, allowing you to continue your life with nothing but a few hours of blank space. The crucial catch to screenwriters Tomislav Cecka and Zdenek Jecelin’s plot is that Rohan cannot legally use any back-ups more than forty-eight-hours old. That’s the cutoff point for “rejection.” Think of the raw data of your mind as an organ being transplanted into your body. It will always be younger than its host and thus an anomalous intrusion to be fought against. So, you must be diligent. You must always remember to upload just in case. And don’t forget: one person’s grace period to allow themselves the oft bout of forgetfulness (or laziness) is another’s loophole. Those forty-eight hours separate salvation from absolute death. We learn about this duality from a lone wolf detective who knows it all too well. Em Trochinowska’s (Andrea Mohylová) husband was killed by a terrorist organization seeking to free humanity from the prison of state-sanctioned immortality. Known as the River of Life, the group murders innocents to prove a counter-intuitive point whereby it instills the fear that no one is safe while also bolstering the importance of Kohan’s work—enough for him to take the company private as a means of “advancing their mission” (increasing profits). Unlike past attacks, however, they’ve finally caught their mistake. Rather than let their work be erased, they now only pull the trigger after their victim’s copy expires. A web of intrigue stemming from Rohan’s chief scientist David Kurlstat (Matěj Hádek) and his wife being the latest “martyrs” ensues as Em once again hopes to use the hunt for a killer to single-handedly stop River of Life completely. It’s precisely this drive to shirk the rules for a personal agenda that endears her to untrustworthy figures and not those protected by said rules. Enter an illegal copy of Kurlstat (missing the six months of memories leading to his death), a suspected terrorist (Milan Ondrík’s Viktor), and a cavalier Europol agent (Václav Neužil’s Mansfield), each leading to more and more secrets that blur the line between good and evil where it comes to wealth and God-complexes. There’s ample lore to work through as far as understanding the overall world on-screen, but it’s so close to our own capitalist wasteland that catching the drift shouldn’t be difficult. The dynamic built between this technology and how it fits into a social hierarchy fueled by profit is similarly easy to comprehend. That means we can devote our energy to getting to the bottom of the more specific mystery. Who benefits most from a group like River of Life? Why is Viktor willing to turn himself in as long as he’s guaranteed a “fair trial”? The answers to these questions are hardly unique, but the journey towards proving them never ceases to entertain. A lot of that has do to with a solid lead turn from Mohylová—ever cautious and skeptical enough to tread lightly with the often-overwrought characters surrounding her. But there’s also the fantastic production design that truly excels beyond obvious budgetary limitations as ingenious art direction expertly turns contemporary items futuristic in lieu of fabricating everything fresh. This is apparently Czechia’s first sci-fi feature in forty years and thus a testament to everyone involved that it proves a worthy return to the genre. It may feel by-the-numbers in scope, but its execution more than makes up the difference. The last departure of the day has driven away, leaving the employees of Kibune, Kyoto’s Japanese Inn ""Fujiya"" with a break before that evening’s new arrivals. Two guests (Gôta Ishida’s Kusumi and Masashi Suwa’s Nomiya) start enjoying a meal. Another hits the hot baths (Haruki Nakagawa’s agent Sugiyama) while his novelist Obata (Yoshimasa Kondô) anxiously attempts to shake writer’s block. Taku (Yûki Torigoe), the establishment’s youngest chef, naps while his seniors (Kohei Morooka’s Morioka and Yoshifumi Sakai’s Eiji) prepare dinner. And Mikoto (Riko Fujitani), Kohachi (Munenori Nagano), and Chino (Saori) continue their shifts. Unfortunately, they all also suddenly find themselves back where they were two minutes prior without warning or explanation. Just chaos. Because chaos is what occurs when a sprawling group of people find themselves stuck in an unexplainable temporal phenomenon. Mikoto and her coworkers catch on quickly because they’re forced to redo menial tasks that render the rewind indisputable. Kusumi and Nomiya need a bit more handholding since the only change they’re seeing right away is the fact the rice they just ate returned to their bowls. Director Junta Yamaguchi and screenwriter Makoto Ueda (who were also behind the equally ingenious time-travel film BEYOND THE INFINITE TWO MINUTES with most of the same cast as part of the Europe Kikaku collective), meticulously go room to room by way of Mikoto’s vantage point as lead to lay the groundwork for their latest RIVER. She becomes the focal point as every two-minute segment’s fade to black reopens with her standing by the water before turning around to help put out whatever fire has inevitably erupted since. First she and Kohachi realize what’s happening. Then they fill in Chino and their boss Shiraki (Masahiro Kuroki). From there it’s Kusumi and Nomiya. Then Obata (who is simultaneously overjoyed at the prospect of ignoring his deadline and curious about the experiences this consequence-free purgatory affords his imagination); Sugiyama (half-naked and desperate to escape the sauna), and Taku (finally waking to the fact the same song has been repeating itself over and over). Add characters who must figure things out themselves (Eiji is a science major who takes it upon himself to discover the time loop’s source and return to normalcy; Kazunari Tosa’s hunter; and Shiori Kubo’s outsider stranded as a result of her vehicle having a frozen engine) and events can’t help spiraling out of control. All the extra time causes everyone to say things they might not normally say—clearing the air and confusing it at the same time. Suddenly they begin to wonder if they are the cause. Idle wishes and prayers to the Gods for love, inspiration, and salvation sharing a common solution: more time. While the journey doesn’t utilize a single-take device like BEYOND, its frenetic pace and potential for extreme emotions (the kind that conjure laughter as much as fear once things reach the point of suicidal thoughts—a time loop staple) demands a similar level of investment that you’ll be more than willing to provide due to its infectious sense of entertainment. The filmmakers know exactly when to pivot from exposition to dramatics to climactic puzzle-solving, never letting us get tired by one aspect or the other. We want to learn about what’s happening alongside these characters while watching how they unravel in response to the ordeal. We want to embrace Mikoto’s unbridled excitement during a wild yet heartfelt second act that gives her control of the narrative to deliver a necessary dream while igniting a nightmare. And we do want there to be a way out regardless of whether it comes as a byproduct of that which we already know or a completely new development in the eleventh hour. When you have a stable of eccentric characters willing to feed into the genre’s stereotypical clichés so Mikoto can travel her own path without them distracting from her own personal progression, it’s easy to get lost in the moment so her highs and lows hit with maximum potency. And yet we still care about the others since the changing world (snow appears and disappears depending on which “world line” the latest reset landed upon) brings their desires into clearer focus too. “Lucas captures it all as data while Mills unleashes the artistry of those numbers courtesy of sight and sound.

J Robert Oppenheimer (interpretado por el actor irlandés Cillian Murphy) es considerado el padre de las armas nucleares, y su legado histórico resulta bastante complejo, como lo expresa el libro American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer de Kai Bird y Martin J Sherwin, en el cual se basa esta película.  El filme se centra en las dos audiencias del gobierno que se desarrollaron en los años 50, y va atrás en tiempo para narrar su trágica historia desde que fue estudiante, seducido por ideas de izquierda, y luego profesor en California, hasta que entra al Proyecto Manhattan en Los Álamos, Nuevo México, confrontando la ciencia con la política y la teoría con la práctica. Como líder de dicho proyecto se le encargó desarrollar la bomba atómica durante el periodo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, y si bien su creación cambió el rumbo de la historia, el uso que se le dio posteriormente se salió de su control, hasta que terminó oponiéndose a la militarización de su propio invento. Esto por supuesto lo condujo a un proceso autodestructivo de su imagen de héroe. En el campo de lo personal tampoco escapó conflictos, viéndose involucrado con dos mujeres, su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt) y una amante militante comunista, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) de temperamento volátil y pasional, que sirvió de excusa para la cacería de brujas a la que fue sometido.  La manera como el director aproxima los miedos que aquejan al personaje y su lucha interna a través de ingeniosas imágenes surrealistas, que pueden ser ráfagas de fuego intenso o finos hilos de luz, es lo más admirable de la cinta, y nos quedamos con ganas de ver más al respecto. Lo mismo sucede con las imágenes voyeristas que hacen memoria de su intimidad, mezclando lo personal con lo político. Por eso el aspecto moral se interpone cuando por un lado su ascendencia judía le hace sentir el compromiso a desarrollar el arma que dará fin a la guerra, temiendo que los alemanes la descubran primero, pero por otro, comprende el peligro del avance ilimitado de la tecnología bélica y el daño que representa para la humanidad.  A pesar de que la primera parte de la película puede resultar algo tediosa Oppenheimer es el proyecto más ambicioso de Nolan, que cuenta con excelentes actuaciones, como Robert Downey Jr, Mat Damon y Benny Safdie, y una impactante fotografía a cargo de Hoyte Van Hoytema que contribuye con la valiente exploración de tan delicados temas.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023"," I don’t consider myself a Christopher Nolan acolyte, even though I count two of his films among my favorites. More often than not, I feel that his overreliance on exposition undermines his ambition. I did not feel that way watching his latest epic, Oppenheimer, a riveting cinematic experience that explores the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb.” Because of Oppenheimer’s biopic nature, Nolan turns his expository tendencies into an attribute as he meticulously expounds on a man who built his life around a branch of physics few of us understand: quantum mechanics. Nolan approaches Oppenheimer from two completely different perspectives. The first, unsurprisingly, is from the point of view of the titular character, played by Cillian Murphy. It begins just before Oppenheimer’s 1926 departure from Cambridge to study theoretical physics in Germany, and ends in 1963 when he was presented with a Presidential Award. After efficiently establishing the key figures in Oppenheimer’s life, not to mention his intimidating intellect (he taught himself Dutch in just six week so he could use it to deliver an entire lecture on quantum theory), two distinct chapters of his life become the dominant focus; engineering the development of the first atomic bomb, and the subsequent undoing of his reputation and political influence by postwar McCarthyism. The second perspective comes from someone who doesn’t exactly leap off of the pages of history, but who’s extremely important nonetheless. His name was Lewis Strauss, the chairperson of the Atomic Energy Commission, for which he tried to recruit Oppenheimer after the war had ended. Strauss, played in old age makeup and gray hair by Robert Downey Jr., recalls his uneasy relationship with Oppenheimer to an aide while attending a Senate confirmation hearing. In just one of his many stylistic touches, Nolan contrasts the differing perspectives of Oppenheimer and Strauss by using color film for Oppenheimer’s POV and black & white for Strauss’s, which not only helps in keeping track of whose head we’re in, but also beautifully symbolizes how differently they each think. Oppenheimer’s dialog-driven historical drama is atypical for Christopher Nolan, but his fondness for juggling multiple timelines hasn’t waned. Nor has his kinetic filmmaking style of rapidly cutting between disparate scenes accompanied by an aggressively persistent background score designed to create a sense of urgency, with abrupt silence, rather than musical crescendos, punctuating the dramatic moments. I usually find Nolan’s hyperbolic manipulation of sound and image exhausting. Here, though, it works, helping Oppenheimer’s three-hour runtime feel much shorter. Several actors manage to distinguish themselves from the massive cast of top-notch talent, including Matt Damon as the Lieutenant General in charge of the Manhattan Project; Benny Safdie as Oppenheimer’s thorny colleague and intellectual foil; Emily Blunt as his fiery, alcoholic wife; and Gary Oldman as a self-satisfied Harry Truman. But no character, in this or any of Nolan’s previous work, is as complexly drawn as Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, who’s presented as intelligent yet naïve, scientific yet philosophical, honest yet secretive, prone to getting lost in thought contemplating whirling electrons and nuclear fusion, and, in the end, a tortured soul. Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy. Considering how now, more than at any other time since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we’re all living under the shadow of Oppenheimer’s creation, Oppenheimer is THE movie of our time.

"Aug 8, 2023"," Christopher Nolan delivers what is certain to be a serious awards contender with this stunning biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. Beautifully shot, brilliantly acted and impressively written, it’s one of the best films of the year. The film unfolds in two parallel timelines, with Nolan cross-cutting between them. The first, entitled Fission, is shot in colour and begins with Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as a student, taking him through his stewardship of the Manhattan Project, the creation of the atom bomb and its eventual deployment by the US government in 1945. The second, Fusion, is shot in black and white, and details both a security clearance hearing that is essentially a kangaroo court aimed at discrediting Oppenheimer, and a separate hearing involving Atomic Energy Commission Chairman Louis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and his potential appointment to the Senate, the significance of which becomes clear as the film unfolds. Throughout the film, important figures in Oppenheimer’s life emerge, including: his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt); his Communist mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), Lt Gen Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who appoints Oppenheimer as the leader of the Manhattan Project; best friend Isidor Rabi (David Krumholz); fellow scientist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett); Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and dog-with-a-bone prosecuting attorney Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), who dominates the security clearance hearing. Murphy (who’s been a reliable supporting presence in previous Nolan movies) is simply terrific in the lead, simultaneously portraying Oppenheimer as arrogant, vulnerable, naïve and visionary. To that end, his ice blue eyes are put to extraordinary use, a faraway gaze that takes in both the future and the past, as well as a universe composed of atoms and electron waves. Murphy essentially makes you feel Oppenheimer’s every thought and it’s intoxicating. The supporting cast are equally astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag. It’s a truly magnificent turn, initially starstruck and then increasingly full of resentment and bitterness as he finds himself opposed to Oppenheimer at various turns. Damon runs him a close second, with a delightful turn as the bullish Groves, and there are memorable turns from a multitude of great character actors as the other scientists at Los Alamos. The script, skilfully adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman’s biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, explores a number of compelling themes, from the central Prometheus parallel (giving mankind the seed of its own fiery destruction) to ideas of guilt and redemption, as well as complex political machination. There’s also the subtle, intriguing suggestion that Nolan sees Oppenheimer as an incendiary twentieth century artist, akin to the likes of T.S. Elliot or Picasso, both of whom receive prominent name-drops. Visually, the film is simply stunning, especially if you’re lucky enough to see it in IMAX on 70mm, the way the director intended – the giant shots of Murphy’s face are worth the price of admission alone. The level of technical achievement throughout is astonishing, from Jennifer Lame’s pacey editing to Hoyt van Hoytema’s striking cinematography, to Ludwig Göransson’s powerful score. Similarly, the sound design is extraordinary, particularly in the aftermath of Hiroshima, when Oppenheimer is forced to confront the magnitude of what he has done, in the face of a seemingly rapturous audience, one of the film’s stand-out scenes. The central set-piece is, of course, the Trinity explosion, complete with an extremely tense build-up and a note of blacker-than-black comedy, as all the scientists agree that there is a “near zero” chance that they won’t ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world in the process, but none of them can really say for certain. The actual detonation is another example of the film’s impressive sound design work, but to say any more would be to dilute the impact. Perhaps Nolan’s most impressive achievement is the fact that he manages to make the hour-long third act of the film (the two hearings) just as compelling as all the bomb-related stuff that precedes it. Effectively, it’s prestige courtroom drama, complete with the genre’s requisite shock twists and turns. In short, this is a stunning piece of work on every level, a compelling, beautifully constructed biopic that leaves you with plenty to think about. It’s also one of the best films of the year. Don’t miss it.",POSITIVE
"Aug 7, 2023"," Dirigido e roteirizado por Christopher Nolan. Com: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Tom Conti, David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Alex Wolff, Josh Zuckerman, Rory Keane, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Dane DeHaan, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, James Urbaniak, Christopher Denham, Dylan Arnold, Rami Malek, James Remar, Olivia Thirlby, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Gary Oldman e Kenneth Branagh. Um dos momentos mais aterrorizantes de Oppenheimer, cinebiografia do “pai da bomba atômica” dirigida por Christopher Nolan, ocorre em uma sala comum na qual um grupo composto por homens brancos discute com frieza absoluta em quais cidades deverão jogar o artefato nuclear criado pelo personagem-título. Cientes de que causarão a morte imediata de no mínimo 20 ou 30 mil pessoas (o número final ficou em torno de 120 mil), eles tratam a questão sem que detalhes como “moral”, “ética” e “humanidade” interfiram no debate – ainda que trivialidades como o fato de um deles ter passado a lua-de-mel em certa cidade acabem por pesar na decisão. Aliás, o único ali que parece hesitar diante do ataque é justamente o responsável por viabilizá-lo, o que talvez explique seus olhos constantemente assombrados. Adaptado pelo próprio Nolan a partir do livro escrito por Kai Bird e Martin Sherwin, o roteiro adota uma cronologia fluida – como já seria de se esperar em um trabalho do cineasta – que se estrutura em torno de dois pontos-chave: o depoimento de Oppenheimer (Murphy) à comissão secreta que decidirá se sua credencial de segurança máxima será mantida e a audiência na qual a nomeação de Lewis Strauss (Downey Jr) para o cargo de Secretário de Comércio do governo Eisenhower é avaliada. A partir destes dois momentos, o filme salta entre épocas e pontos de vista, concentrando boa parte de sua atenção, claro, no desenvolvimento do Projeto Manhattan e na relação entre o físico e o general Groves (Damon), bem como em detalhes de sua turbulenta vida pessoal, incluindo seu caso com a psiquiatra Jean Tatlock (Pugh) e seu casamento com a bióloga Katherine Oppenheimer (Blunt). Não é de se espantar que, considerando a posição importante do protagonista em um período essencial da História, a trajetória de Oppenheimer inclua interações com dezenas de figuras notórias, o que confere a Nolan a oportunidade de escalar um elenco composto por nomes que habitualmente não aceitariam fazer participações tão breves que, por vezes, soam quase como figuração - como Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Jack Quaid, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek e Gary Oldman -, o que por vezes mais distrai do que acrescenta à produção. Por outro lado, Robert Downey Jr. e Matt Damon aproveitam a oportunidade de viver tipos bastante distintos de seus papeis habituais: este último, evocando a rigidez e a disciplina de um militar veterano; o primeiro, abraçando a amargura e as inseguranças de um homem sem qualquer traço da jovialidade que o ator costuma trazer aos seus personagens. Enquanto isso, Florence Pugh projeta com intensidade a instabilidade psicológica de Tatlock sem permitir que isto defina aquela mulher, ao passo que Emily Blunt escapa da armadilha de encarnar o estereótipo de esposa ressentida ao emprestar a Kitty uma frustração interessante com a aparente passividade do marido, o que a leva a adotar uma postura combativa e valente. Nenhuma destas performances funcionaria, porém, se o centro emocional do filme não contasse com o trabalho irrepreensível de Cillian Murphy, que contrapõe a racionalidade aparente de Oppenheimer às suas paixões ideológicas, românticas e sexuais que muitas vezes o levam a cometer atos impulsivos (ou a fazer declarações imprudentes) que o tornam imprevisível e, consequentemente, fascinante. É instigante, por exemplo, vê-lo abandonar os modos calmos e discretos ao se empolgar diante do interesse acadêmico de seus alunos, exibindo também incapacidade de resistir ao seu desejo por Tatlock e mesmo à sua admiração pelos princípios irredutíveis que – percebam a ironia - a mantêm inalcançável. De forma similar, o ator consegue a proeza de conciliar a obsessão científica do sujeito pela criação da bomba e sua resistência humanista em utilizá-la depois de construída sem que isso soe como pura demagogia ou hipocrisia. Empregando a excelente fotografia de Hoyte Van Hoytema para distinguir visualmente a abordagem narrativa entre a subjetividade de Oppenheimer e uma visão mais distante (não necessariamente objetiva) de sua vida, o longa salta respectivamente entre sequências rodadas em cores e em preto-e-branco – e o fato de boa parte destas últimas se concentrarem em Strauss acaba estabelecendo também um subtexto importante sobre sua visão de mundo e aquela mais abrangente do personagem-título. Além disso, a fabulosa trilha composta por Ludwig Göransson é hábil ao trazer harmonias que parecem enxergar as epifanias científicas de Oppenheimer como algo quase poético, transcendental, enxergando beleza no que poderia se restringir a equações e descrições frias sobre a natureza da fissão nuclear. Para completar, a montagem de Jennifer Lame vai além da simples quebra cronológica, empregando inserts quase abstratos que ilustram os insights do protagonista e oferecem uma porta de entrada para o modo como sua mente opera. Diferente da maior parte da filmografia de Nolan, que normalmente deposita seus esforços mais na elaboração de tramas e menos no desenvolvimento detalhado das figuras que as movem, Oppenheimer pode de certa maneira ser considerado um estudo de personagem – e ainda que os eventos da vida do físico sejam relevantes para o roteiro, o cineasta mantém o foco na atmosfera da narrativa (ao menos, como percebida/sentida pelo protagonista). Aqui e ali, claro, há certo exagero (não estou certo de que incluir a imagem de Oppenheimer nu e transando com Tatlock na sala em que está sendo forçado a discutir sua intimidade seja necessário, martelando no espectador algo que este já havia compreendido), mas de modo geral estas intervenções mais expressivas contribuem para que o público se aproxime de uma figura que poderia com facilidade se manter como um enigma indecifrável. Já os aspectos morais da destruição de Hiroshima e Nagasaki não têm nada de ambíguos na visão do filme, que enxerga com reprovação tanto o cinismo do governo (e dos militares) norte-americano – como usar o termo “artefato” no lugar de “bomba” – quanto suas justificativas para o ataque, já que a Alemanha havia se rendido meses antes e o Japão caminhava para o mesmo fim. (Discuti esta visão – defendida por muitos historiadores contemporâneos – neste post em meu blog.) Não que a obra busque absolver Oppenheimer, já que o próprio fazia questão de se condenar, mas os olhares mais severos são aqueles voltados para os políticos e militares diretamente envolvidos na decisão de usar as bombas, o que inclui o Harry S. Truman que Gary Oldman encarna como um canalha orgulhoso e xenofóbico (o que de fato era). Beneficiado ainda por um desenho de som brilhante que atinge um de seus melhores momentos na cena em que o êxito da bomba é celebrado por uma plateia em júbilo e durante a qual alguns dos brados empolgados são transformados em gritos de pânico (e que também sabe utilizar o silêncio com inteligência, como na sequência que gira em torno de Trinity, como o primeiro teste da bomba foi batizado), Oppenheimer em vários instantes soa como um pesadelo que atormenta não só o protagonista, mas toda a humanidade.

"Aug 7, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s OPPENHEIMER demands that we consider the father of the atomic bomb’s life in context, the which he does with stunning clarity considering the paradoxes the film considers. Like the quantum world revealed by the new physics that Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) brought to the United States between the world wars, things can work even if the underpinnings of why defy rational explanation. That can mean a relationship between adults, or the construction of a bomb that will change the world even if the math behind it doesn’t work. Searching for the reality behind it is, as opined by a character, fruitless, even if it is a fascinating intellectual exercise. And that is what Nolan has constructed here, a peerless intellectual thriller told with urgency and embracing the paradox until it resolves into a bittersweet poetic sort of justice proving Einstein’s (here an an avuncular Tom Conti) conjecture that God does not play dice. Told in flashbacks and flashforwards, the narrative structure mimics the fluidity of time in that ci-mentioned quantum world. The facts of Oppenheimer’s life are stripped down to details that move the story along without weighing it down. Key moments and elegantly simple montages telescope time and speak to the revolution in physics, as well as the culture, that enthralled Oppenheimer, including the left-leaning politics that would come to haunt him. They also highlight the contradictions of a troubled young man who once tried to poison a tutor that he particularly liked. These resolve themselves into a man who is both a genius and an innocent, who understands that theory will only get you so far, as he puts it, but who is continually baffled by the shifting realpolitik of life where everything is relative. Again, thank you Albert. Shifting between color and black & white, between Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing before the Gray Board in 1954, and the Senate hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) in 1959, a proceeding that comes to hinge on the former, Oppenheimer’s life from troubled post-grad with no talent for experimental physics, to the most influential scientist of his day is recounted, not chronologically, but in a series of juxtapositions that compare and contrast testimony while also creating an atmosphere of intrigue and danger that ranks with the very best suspense films. Underpinning that is Nolan’s dialogue of rigorous precision that, ahem, paradoxically exposes the vagaries of language, be it a mathematical formula or a cross-examination or a defining the end of the world as we know it. It is the mark of a master that he can take an incident, in this case the explosion of the first atomic bomb, and make it unbearably tense. Yet Nolan does just that. With skillful editing, a hand (Josh Peck in a pivotal role) hovering over a large red button, and jittery set of strings building to a musical crescendo that explodes into silence, the Trinity explosion telegraphs not just the uncertainty of what will happen when the countdown reaches zero, but the weight of two hundred years of physics distilled down to a moment that might end life on the planet, or prove that that everything they believe is wrong. Here and throughout, Nolan gives us the facts, and the revelations, but also judicious foreshadowing by externalizing Oppenheimer’s inner struggle to navigate the real world with cuts to the quantum world that obsesses him. Murphy, and his incandescent blue eyes, capture that peculiar innocence and passionate curiosity that comes of living in a reality that is only tangential to the rest of the world’s. Stymied by the imprecision of language, and adhering to a moral certitude that may be evolved, may be misguided, might very well be both, it results in his crowning achievement and his downfall. The innocence has a childlike quality that expects the world to make sense, and a delicacy that is continually surprised and wounded when it isn’t. That world is populated by great love Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) whose emotional instability is matched only by her own passion and intelligence, and wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), a whip-smart, emphasis on whip, biologist at a time when the world had no use for one. Her own instability, so often glibly pigeon-holed as “difficult”, is presented with compassion, and the relationship she had with Oppenheimer is less analyzed than explicated in all its messy complexity as something that worked for them, and that without which, neither would have been able to thrive, leaving us with the pointed question, who are we to judge? The early days in Europe learning the new physics bring us Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) who sees Oppenheimer’s potential being wasted, Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) who overlooks Oppenheimer’s innocent (there’s that word again) arrogance to become his biggest supporter in good times and bad, as well as the voice of ethics and reason. The Manhattan Project, four years and $2 billion, brings Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as the ultimate pragmatist, tasked with wrangling the best minds at his disposal to do the impossible and build the atom bomb before the Nazis do; the formidably arrogant Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) playing with paper airplanes to emphasize his contempt for everyone around him, and Lt. Col. Nichols (Dane deHaan) as the ultimate functionary, as easily imagined, like the head of security, Col. Boris Pash (Casey Affleck), heiling as saluting if an accident of birth had landed them in Germany rather than America. Then there is Strauss, politically entwined with Oppenheimer, the embodiment of vain egotism and the ultimate politician untethered to anything but power. Downy’s performance is never simple and has the underpinnings of a tragic hero in a mold diametrically different from that of Oppenheimer, and in its own way, replete as it is with a self-awareness that Oppenheimer lacked, the quintessence of tragedy. OPPENHEIMER is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain that constant immediacy. I sincerely hope that there is a longer director’s cut, if only to extend the pleasure of watching an artist at work. And maybe giving Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid), more than a few words and some bongo riffs. Very impressive, probably one of the most thorough and incisive biopic in a long time. Would be a gross injustice for it not to receive Academy Award consideration for best pic and Murphy for best actor.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2023",One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects&#8217; contradictions&#46; If anything&#44; he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable&#46; Who was J&#46; Robert Oppenheimer&#63;,POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023"," It’s often said that the victors write history. Although the Allies won World War II, who ‘won’ the battle for influence and power within American politics and society in the aftermath of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is a more difficult question to untangle. OPPENHEIMER doesn’t necessarily seek to do so, but its shifting chronology charts the personal viewpoints of those involved in these global conflicts. Chief among those figures is J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the director of the Los Alamos laboratory and Manhattan Project. The film jumps across different periods of his life (progressing linearly but intercut in a typical piece of Nolan time manipulation) from his early studies, through the development of the atomic bomb and its deployment, the decision to strip his security clearance in 1954 at the height of the post-War Red Scare period, to Lewis Strauss’ (Robert Downey Jnr.) confirmation hearings for a US cabinet post in 1959 (where there was a strand of questioning over his role in ‘the Oppenheimer affair’). The entwined time periods have a slightly disorienting effect as the film establishes itself, whirling at breakneck speed from a young-looking Cillian Murphy, through Oppenheimer’s tenure at Lewis Strauss’s Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, to a somewhat more haggard and aged appearance at the 1954 hearings. However, without the needlessly complex mechanics of TENET to contend with (their first collaboration), Nolan’s second film with editor Jennifer Lame bears more fruit this time. The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy. “The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy.” The bomb’s development and the Trinity test are, naturally, the plot’s pivot points. Still, the structure of OPPENHEIMER lends that literal explosive force metaphorically to the lead-up and aftermath of the detonation, conferring the same sense of urgency and impact. The film successfully imbues the postwar period with rising panic (the film’s final moments become a horrifying pit of dread) and the pre-bombing build-up with a horrible sense of inevitability. The chain reaction is not the literal one of a nuclear fission device but the paranoia, fear, and response it unleashed. A more conventional and linear biopic approach covering the time depicted here would probably be described as a ‘slow burn’ and perhaps a film that ‘peters out’, but OPPENHEIMER is neither despite its substantial three-hour runtime. Every scene beats with an urgency no matter the period depicted. In particular, the decision to also focus segments of the film around Lewis Strauss’ 1959 senate confirmation hearings puts American politics and society squarely in the story’s blast radius. How did America’s individualism as a country contribute to how the bomb’s development and deployment played out? How did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of non-conformism impact the post-war world? Strauss heralds the Institute for Advanced Study to Oppenheimer as “a haven for independent minds”, and Oppenheimer is feted with celebrity for his individual rhetorical flair and scientific aptitude. Yet, his non-conformism with previous left-wing attitudes, communist associations, and penchant for collective action place a cloud over his proclamations for measures to control nuclear proliferation and opposition to the subsequent development of the hydrogen bomb. The sense of individual exceptionalism – for both the USA and its great minds – hurtles the world to the atomic age and the Cold War. The distrust of non-conformist figures and collective action perpetuates that conflict indefinitely, an escalating positive feedback cycle that many thought could (and maybe still will) bring about Armageddon. “American politics and society squarely in the story’s blast radius. How did America’s individualism as a country contribute to how the bomb’s development and deployment played out? How did a failure to reconcile the celebrated individualism of its citizens against mistrust of non-conformism impact the post-war world?” The spectre of the US government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bomb’s deployment. Lewis Strauss’s role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role, which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism. In this regard, it heightens the impact of this narrow focus that the effect on Japan goes unexamined. To do so would afford a global perspective many of the figures depicted in the film are simply not concerned about, aptly demonstrated by the depiction of US Secretary of War Henry Stimson, who spares Kyoto on account of having honeymooned there. Much is also made of how Oppenheimer’s left-wing leanings make him easier to control for General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who at one point barks, “You have the rights I give to you – no more, no less!” “The spectre of the US government apparatus hangs over the response to the atomic bomb’s deployment. Lewis Strauss’s role here comes down to his confirmation hearing in a reasonably minor cabinet role, which shows the global ramifications are viewed by many depicted here through a very insular prism.” Robert Downey Jnr. is the perfect vessel for Strauss, deploying an affable arrogance weaponised to hide that his frame of mind is almost the inversion of Oppenheimer’s. Strauss uses conciliatory charm and fig leaves of cooperation to hide a ruthless individualism and sense of entitlement. In contrast, Oppenheimer’s individual brilliance and personal arrogance undermine a communitarian world outlook and preference for collective action. The film is not perfect by any means and bears some of the less effective hallmarks of Nolan’s recent work. Alden Ehrenreich’s role degenerates into the most recent example of expository vessels that have recurred in Nolan’s work, his advisor firing out leading questions like ChatGPT prompts, constructing open goals for Downey Jnr. to lay out the plot or character motivations. Composer Ludwig Göransson’s second collaboration fares better than the migraine-inducing TENET score but lacks either the impact of his work elsewhere (especially his work on The Mandalorian or with Ryan Coogler on CREED or BLACK PANTHER) or the emotional clarity of Nolan’s work with Hans Zimmer. However, the insistent drive of the film and the terrifically involving performances – no more so than Cillian Murphy’s – allow the film’s shockwave to hit regardless. Focusing on personal viewpoints for this globally significant development may seem curiously narrow. Still, OPPENHEIMER achieves what the best biopics often do: using the personal lens to foreground and examine the wider ramifications of events. There are no more significant potential ramifications than the end of the world, and that awful looming mushroom cloud haunts every frame of this tense and emotionally violent portrait.",POSITIVE
"Aug 5, 2023"," Directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer follows Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer as he progresses through his rigorous studies to become the director of World War II’s infamous Manhattan Project. Filmmaker Nolan, armed with his own script, delivers a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama that admittedly does start with some promise, as the movie, which runs a punishing 180 minutes, boasts a striking opening stretch that contains all of the hallmarks and touchstones associated with Nolan’s work – including eye-popping visuals, an intense, ceaseless score, and several electrifying stand-alone interludes and sequences. (The inevitable Trinity test interlude is as astonishing and enthralling as one might’ve imagined, for example.) There’s little doubt, then, that Oppenheimer‘s downfall is due primarily to its exhaustingly dense (and egregiously propulsive) narrative, with the picture progressing into a relentless midsection that contains hardly anything in the way of breathing room – which, in turn, ensures that the second half increasingly adopts an anticlimactic, endless feel (ie virtually everything that comes after the Trinity set-piece can’t help but come off as needless and somewhat interminable). The film’s relative failure is especially disappointing given its proliferation of engrossing attributes, including spellbinding performances by Murphy and his myriad of costars and a handful of engrossing quieter moments (eg James Remar’s Secretary of War attempts to decide where in Japan the bomb should be dropped), and it does seem apparent, ultimately, that Oppenheimer would’ve benefited from a more sedate (and traditional) approach to its inherently compelling subject matter.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 4, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, Oppenheimer, the movie being covered here, wouldn’t exist. One of the most anticipated movies of the year, you would hope that Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer will live up to the hype. And boy does it. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer tells the story of the physicist who is responsible for the creation of the Atomic bomb — and the moral questions that came along with that work. The movie spends much of its first hour on exposition to show what kind of man Robert Oppenheimer was. And to be clear, we’re talking about him as a character from this point forward. The audience sees him as a brilliant scientist who doesn’t quite fit in. He’s a man who has a loneliness about him, who is often trapped by the inner workings of his mind. Yet the point isn’t to feel sorry for him. He’s narcissistic and has it in his heart to inject an apple with cyanide to get back at an instructor who shames him in the lab. This scene ultimately foreshadows the rest of the film. While Robert is capable of injecting an apple with poison, knowing full well what the purpose of doing so is, his conscience catches up to him and he races to stop the man from eating the poisoned apple. Robert eventually moves to Germany to study Quantum Mechanics. Being a Jewish man there at that time complicates matters, something the film could have done well to explore a bit more than it does. Yes, it’s a three-hour movie, which is over-the-top for any film, yet there are plenty of times the film rushes past important moments and glosses over characters that deserve a little more attention. There’s no question this is an extremely male movie. It’s based in history, so it’s not shocking that the key characters are all white men. However, Robert’s relationships with Jean (Florence Pugh) and Kitty (Emily Blunt) are so central to the man he is and the man he evolves to be throughout the film. Both women, and those stories, aren’t given enough screen time. It’s a shame to see Pugh and Blunt underutilized in this way. They each give incredible performances, no doubt, but even fleshing out their stories just a tiny bit more would have made this film more satisfying. In particular, it’s disappointing that more attention isn’t given to the way Robert and Kitty struggle with Peter as a baby, or to Jean’s eventual suicide. The film remains breathtaking and deeply emotional despite those flaws, though. The way the story unfolds, with flashbacks and transitions from color to black-and-white, allows for a more artful narrative as the audience puts the pieces together to understand the mistakes Robert made — and what was out of his hands entirely. What Oppenheimer does is leads the audience to actually root for, at least on some level, the success of the bomb that Oppenheimer has been asked — er, told — to work on. The justification is that it’s the only way to end the war altogether, but more than that, the audience is brought along for the journey of a great science experiment. Brilliant scientists gather together in a town created for just this purpose. They bring their families to Los Alamos and pour everything they have into making the bomb a reality. Their hard work and their sacrifices become the key focus, Robert’s included. So when the scientists finally test the bomb, it’s the beauty of it that takes center stage. The explosion is presented in magnificent, gorgeous detail. It’s astounding, colorful, artistic, and silent — until it isn’t. The sound comes crashing in startling form to signify just how terrifying this weapon could be. But the moment that really matters, the one that leaves a pit in your stomach, is when the scientists learn that the bomb has been dropped over Hiroshima. Again, it’s a scene presented in artistic detail, flashing back and forth between cheers and reactions of guilt and sickness. And as Robert is to speak about its success, what he sees instead is the damage that’s been done, in every horrifying, unsettling image. Cillian Murphy’s portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer is incredible throughout the film, but this may be the standout moment. He makes the audience every conflicted feeling he does, and it’s gutwrenching. There is more to this story, however. As Robert battles his guilt over what he’s helped create, and fights fame, he hopes to prevent the government from using this as a stepping stone to create something worse. And all the while, he comes to be accused of leaking information. While this part of the film is perhaps the least interesting overall, it reveals the motives of the people around him, and it serves, narratively, as a way to explain key parts of his character throughout the film. It also reveals his downfall and eventually leads the film to what is perhaps its most poignant message. There was always the possibility, as the scientists work to create the bomb, that it could start a chain reaction that may never end. And ultimately, it did. As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time.

"Aug 4, 2023"," “Oppenheimer,” the extraordinary film written and directed by the redoubtable Christopher Nolan, tackles not just the history of one man and the seminal event that came to define him, but also the complex intersection of science, politics and the cult of personality. Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science. More amazingly, I still don’t understand physics beyond Newton’s third law of motion that “every action has an equal and opposite reaction.” And yet, curiously, that quote also applies to the emotional reactions of the protagonists in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the Atomic Bomb. Based on what is arguably considered the best biography written about Oppenheimer, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin who spent 25 years researching and writing it, Nolan took this base material and focused on the successful attempt to dismantle Oppenheimer’s reputation, building the background by going backwards and forwards in Oppenheimer’s life. Much like Prometheus, the Greek god of fire who was punished by Zeus for giving fire to humans, the post World War II life of Robert Oppenheimer doomed him to serve penance for what many saw as conceit compounded by his many human frailties—sexual, political and intellectual. But this modern day Prometheus who unleashed the  power of atomic energy could be more closely associated with Icarus, the mortal who dared to fly too close to the sun. In Greek mythology, Icarus and Daedalus, his father, devised wings made of threads, feathers and wax to flee their labyrinthian prison. His father warned him to beware of the sins of hubris and complacency, advising him not to fly too high lest the sun melt his wings. But Icarus refused to listen and the sun melted his wings, whereupon he fell into the sea and drowned. And a labyrinth of storytelling is what this movie is. Tracking between time frames in his life, Nolan smoothly transitions from the 1953-54 Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Kangaroo Court instigated by AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss to relieve Oppenheimer of his security clearance, to Oppenheimer’s early career as he finds his way to theoretical physics in England and Germany. From his ambivalent dabbling in left wing and Communist circles, to his leadership in the Los Alamos branch of the Manhattan Project, the vast, decentralized program to harness nuclear fusion and create enough energy to power an atomic bomb, and the consequences of Strauss’s harassment of an intellectual foe with a still deep base of support from the scientific heavyweights of the time. In poker terms, this is a study of the consequences of overplaying your hand.  It is a complicated story centered on a complex individual who is understood by many and misunderstood by most. Oppenheimer’s initial focus was in chemistry, his major at Harvard, but he soon found his way to physics and pursued that course at Cambridge. It was there that he discovered he loathed lab studies and was unsuited for experimental physics. An encounter with Max Born (Nobel Prize 1959) led him to the University of Göttingen in Germany where the field of theoretical physics and quantum mechanics were starting to take hold. Under the tutelage of Born, Oppenheimer received his PhD in 1927. It was here that he encountered and befriended future theoretical physics giants such as Werner Heisenberg and Pascual Jordan, both pioneers in quantum mechanics and future Nazis. Also with him at Göttingen were Edward Teller and future Nobelists Erwin Schrödinger (as in the cat), Paul Dirac, Wolfgang Pauli and Enrico Fermi. Fermi would later lead the University of Chicago section of the Manhattan Project; Teller would join Oppenheimer in Los Alamos. Returning to the United States, Oppenheimer received appointments at both CalTech and Berkeley. His residency at Berkeley was significant both for his championing and establishing a group focusing on theoretical physics, where none previously existed, and his association with experimental physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, the pioneer of the cyclotron that would be instrumental in developing the atomic bomb. It was also at Berkeley, a bastion of left wing ideology long before the 1960s, that Oppenheimer flirted with Communism, never joining but always cavorting. His brother Frank, urged on by his wife at the time, joined, and Oppenheimer’s lover, the volatile Jean Tatlock, was an active member. Oppenheimer’s political leanings were decidedly to the left of center, possibly far left, but his ambivalence was probably more fueled by his avoidance of being identified as one thing or another. Thus, all sides of the pro and anti equation thought he was something he wasn’t.  As war started to rear its head in Europe and rumors of Jewish annihilation in Nazi Germany began to surface, Einstein, now living in the United States, wrote a letter to President Roosevelt warning him that Germany was researching the use of uranium in bombs and that the U.S. needed to begin such a project immediately. Thus were born the seeds of the Manhattan Project, a multi-pronged, rather decentralized program to harness the new physics of the atom into practical military usage. General (or soon to be) Leslie Groves was appointed to head the project and choose the sites for research as well as those individuals to head up each division. In typical Army thinking, Groves previous experience was in the construction of the Pentagon, something that was deemed suitable experience for supervising a high level physics project. But his skill area was actually in choosing the right people to head each program and he chose Oppenheimer, a curiously counter-intuitive selection based on his assumed politics and lack of managerial expertise, for the Los Alamos project, a site suggested by Oppenheimer. It is Strauss’s animus that shades so much of the film. By the time they first meet, it is after the war and Strauss offers the now famous and lauded Oppenheimer the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, long the home of Einstein. It is here that Strauss’s multi-pronged hostility takes root when he is convinced that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him. Whether this actually happened or not, what is unmentioned is that Strauss, a Trustee of the Institute, was, himself, a candidate for the directorship. Losing it may have been hard (he was 5th choice) but having to give it to a left winger like Oppenheimer was a humiliation, but only the first. Strauss, a Jew committed to many religious organizations, was disdainful of Oppenheimer’s secular attitude. A wealthy, self-made man without a college education, Strauss was both proud and defensive of his origins.  Strike two came later when Oppenheimer, as a member of the General Advisory Committee of the newly formed AEC ridiculed Strauss’s position that the humanitarian provision of radio isotopes to our allies was a security risk. Worse, the full AEC board, of which Strauss was a member, voted four to one to release the isotopes, leaving Strauss on the fringes.  Returning to the Los Alamos years, Oppenheimer, Oppie as he was affectionately called, made sure that Groves’ dictum that all research be compartmentalized for security reasons was followed, at least in practicality if not in spirit. Alien to Oppenheimer’s nature, he created committees and subgroups across divisions that discussed relevant findings that could dovetail into furthering the work and speeding their results.  As chronological as this retelling may be, the most important takeaways about Oppenheimer’s personality are his inclusiveness and ability to stay out of the way of the men he hand picked. His brilliance, as viewed by others, was his incisive mind; but from my standpoint, his brilliance was in recognizing his own intellectual shortcomings and refusing to interfere in arenas where others had skills that surpassed his own. Of the scientists he chose to join him in Los Alamos, seventeen would go on to win Nobel Prizes. Abraham Pais, a colleague of Oppenheimer’s at the Institute for Advanced Study, said of him “there was no greater satisfaction for him than to see such efforts bear fruit and then to tell others of the work that someone had done.” (“J. Robert Oppenheimer: A Biographical Memoir” by H.A. Bethe. National Academy of Sciences.) Oftentimes accused of arrogance, I believe it was more a recognition of his own worth that may have grated on those who did not fly in his circle and Strauss was one who did not. Humility is generally not a characteristic associated with genius. To quote David Lillianthal, first chairman of the AEC: “He was the only authentic genius I have ever met.” But there is no doubt that our modern day Icarus flew too close to the sun. He was against the creation of the Hydrogen Bomb and nuclear proliferation, both loudly supported by Edward Teller and Lewis Strauss. Never apologizing for the use of the atomic bomb on Japan, Oppenheimer campaigned against its further implementation. Teller never forgave Oppenheimer for not pursuing his model of the Hydrogen Bomb at Los Alamos despite the fact that Oppenheimer allowed him to continue his research on this infinitely more powerful weapon undisturbed. That Teller testified against him at Strauss’s 1953-54 hearing would eventually have negative consequences on Teller’s acceptance in the academic community.  Oppenheimer’s inability to control his libido didn’t help him in his personal life, choosing his paramours from among the wives of his colleagues. His own marriage and its shotgun aspect may have fueled some of his ambivalence to fidelity but his leanings were well-established early on.  Nolan assembled a cast of thousands, well at least many, and all of them deliver some of the best work in their vast repertoires. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is a revelation of depth, drama, intelligence and complexity. He is in almost every frame and holds us in the intensity of his haunting blue-eyed gaze. Like others in this film, it is impossible to think of any other actor who could play this role. Nothing in his previous work with Nolan (“Dunkirk,” “Inception”) would lead you to believe that he would be the natural lead for a movie about one of the most important scientists of our time and yet he is. Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss gives the performance of his career, one that will allow you to forget that he has spent the last decade playing comic book superheroes. His Strauss is subtle, devious and duplicitous all couched smoothly in the skin of a patriot. The very embodiment of a paranoiac, Downey effectively conveys the feelings of the very smart when they encounter true genius. The dismay reveals itself in his body language as Strauss is left on the sidelines instead of the center to which he is accustomed. The expression “revenge is a dish best served cold” comes to mind as you witness the machinations played out tiny bit by tiny bit. Bland, almost obsequious in his early dealings with Oppenheimer, he is the proverbial wolf in sheep’s clothing, luring his surprisingly naive and blindered prey to cliff’s edge where only a tap on the back will yield the precipitous fall he has engineered almost from the start of their relationship. An unrecognizable Emily Blunt plays Kitty Oppenheimer, the long suffering and insufferable wife. The anger smoldering just below the surface and her overall dissatisfaction is one that she makes understandable to all who would laud her husband. She is an actress of incredible range and Nolan successfully makes use of it.  There are far too many amazing actors, most of whom make a meal of the small roles they play. Foremost among them is Matt Damon as General Groves. One never doubts the seriousness of his task and yet Damon is able to leaven many of his moments with a subtle humor that makes you smile. His was one of my favorite roles.  Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock as the unhinged and passionate temptation that Oppenheimer is never able to resist. Josh Hartnett portrays Ernest Lawrence as a charmer, one who is comfortable in his brilliant skin. Tom Conti has a wonderful cameo as Einstein and Benny Safdie is a very petulant Edward Teller who can see no other way than his own. Gustaf Skarsgård, son of Stellan and brother of Alexander, is a sympathetic Hans Bethe, a friend through thick and thin of Oppenheimer, but then again, Oppie probably didn’t sleep with his wife. Kenneth Branaugh plays Niels Bohr (interesting side note, Bohr’s son Aage Neils Bohr worked alongside him in Los Alamos and would also go on to win his own Nobel Prize, making them one of the only father-son Nobelists). And, in a notable role as Roger Robb, the vengeful Strauss loyalist and lead of the secret committee meeting to emasculate Openheimer, Jason Clarke gives the kind of chilling performance that makes the hair on your arms stand up. But these are only a few of the more recognizable actors among the many, many fantastic men and women who play noticeable roles in “Oppenheimer.” The score by Ludwig Göransson pulsates and underpins the action sequences and those of the lushly filmed light explosions. The music heightens the urgency attached to the work in Los Alamos. Shot gloriously in Imax by Hoyte Van Hoytema, he has captured lightning in a bottle with his clips of light explosions and chemical reactions that fill the screen. He has made the desert, almost a moonscape, another character in the film. See “Oppenheimer” in a theater and on an IMAX or XD formatted screen if at all possible. Cinematically, emotionally, this movie carves out a world that is filled, in equal measures, with optimism and despair. Oppenheimer and “Oppenheimer” are more than the sum of their respective parts.

"Aug 4, 2023"," Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s 12th feature film and perhaps his most ambitious yet. That’s saying something considering this is the director of challenging epics such as Interstellar, Dunkirk and Tenet, the latter arguably being one of Nolan’s weakest films.  Oppenheimer is definitely a step up from Tenet; a much more relatable and human story and one that bears a huge historical significance. Nolan attacks J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story head-on, attempting to understand a complex man who would go on to be credited as the ‘Father of the Atomic Bomb’.  Here, he is presented as a man with a sense of uncompromising vision and purpose, but one who would become haunted by the part he played in history.  As we’ve already seen from the impressive trailers, Oppenheimer unfolds both in colour and black-and-white sequences. Nolan has already commented on this choice, with colour scenes representing Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. The black-and-white unfold from the perspective of Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss and are more objective in nature.  The style choice proves a tad jarring at first. In fact, the entire first hour of Oppenheimer is rushed and packed to the brim with information which is near-impossible to absorb. Nolan throws characters, names, places and science-y words at us at a dizzying pace and it becomes exhausting.  Thankfully, after that first hour, Oppenheimer really finds its groove. The dual timeline follows Oppenheimer as he attempts to build a bomb to “end all wars” as well as the fallout from that as he is, years later, sitting in front of a security council, being questioned about his past relationships and intentions.  The difference between Oppenheimer in 1942 and 1954 is staggering. Not so much because of any make-up or VFX tricks to age actor Cillian Murphy, but the haunted look on the actor’s face. Murphy is simply extraordinary as Oppenheimer, a man driven by blind ambition and aimless innovation.  Murphy is supported by the very handsome and talented cast around him. Out of the large – too large, you might say – cast, Downey Jr. and Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, stand out. Downey Jr. is remarkable in a tricky role that’s far-removed from his witty public persona and his role as Tony Stark in the MCU.  But Oppenheimer is definitely a bit of a sausage fest. While Blunt is sharp as Kitty, Nolan’s writing is flawed when it comes to his female characters. Oppenheimer includes Nolan’s first sex scene and it’s exactly as you’d imagine it; unfussy, straight to the point and a little awkward.  Florence Pugh plays Oppenheimer’s early girlfriend Jean Tatlock. She only has roughly 15 minutes of screentime, but Pugh makes the most of it, even though a large portion of the role requires being naked. Without spoiling too much, Kitty and Jean’s characterisations feel a little old-fashioned and troubling. There simply doesn’t seem to be time or any real effort to build or develop the women in Oppenheimer’s life.  Ludwig Göransson’s score, as expected, is magnificent, but heavily planted in some scenes, which marginally eats away some of the film’s magic. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s cinematography is awe-inspiring and Nolan, a pragmatic, economic director, certainly knows how to frame a shot and find the essence of every scene.  The tight close-ups on Oppenheimer tell us more about him than any line of dialogue ever could and a sequence where the crew tests the bomb might be the finest scene we’ll see on the big screen this year. Nolan has previously stated that the film is a little bit of a horror film and that statement feels correct; there is something utterly horrifying about Oppenheimer’s story, but crucially, Nolan never defends or judges him.  Nolan also never shows us any of the destruction that Oppenheimer’s creation leaves behind. Oppenheimer casually mentions the land they have built the testing site and an entire town should be given “back to the Indians”, but for the most part, Oppenheimer is another story about a white man’s guilt without any input from the communities that were affected by his actions.  Oppenheimer, much like its titular character, slightly falls victim to its own, endless ambition. The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars. Nolan, who has always been accused of being unemotional and cold as a storyteller, has crafted his most humane film yet.  ★★★☆☆

"Aug 3, 2023"," TEXAS, USA — It’s telling that Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” – a mammoth drama that zips through montages of men talking in congressional chambers, scientific labs, and New Mexico deserts where history will eventually come alive with blinding light and a gut-level reaction like few directors can achieve on this scale – ends suddenly. What we’re left with is a note of mystery over whether we’ve really seen it all.  It could be because the political power games that stuffed and sometimes stifled the events of the previous three hours are finally revealed as what they were: Petty Washington squabbling failing to take full stock of the godly power that’s been delivered by the movie’s eponymous physicist until doom dawns behind the globe-sized eyes of the actor playing him. For as much as Nolan’s epics traffic in mind-melting rules (at least until shattering them with an IMAX-screen-sized mallet) the British filmmaker also loves leaving us with a tinge of cosmic ambiguity. And Cillian Murphy – playing J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, in a rare and welcome leading part – comes equipped with a gaze able to channel that ambiguity with startling clarity.  It could also be that “Oppenheimer” simply hasn’t earned the moment. Ever since “Inception,” every new Nolan film has felt like a summation of what he’s been building up to; his movies may be cold, but coldness is the natural destination for his characters once they’ve been humbled by their own sheer brilliance. Bruce Wayne and Alfred Borden and Dom Cobb eventually come face to face with the worlds of their own making—as does J. Robert Oppenheimer, among the most brilliant of Nolan protagonists, if the slow-onset psychological devastation we come to witness is any indication. Yet at times in this 180-minute saga, it can seem like Nolan – working from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography ""American Prometheus"" – obfuscates the full depths of his subject’s burden, undercutting the very subjectivity that sets the movie’s best sequences ablaze with the consequences of ostensibly heroic actions. “Theory can only take you so far,” Oppenheimer says at one point. Indeed.  Oppenheimer was a physicist but “Oppenheimer” is as sturdy a feat of cinematic engineering as any of Nolan’s prior efforts. Nolan approaches his stories like Rubik’s cubes, which here means we’re kept on our toes so as not to stumble under the constantly shifting tectonic plates of his script. The movie opens several years after the bomb has been dropped in 1945, foregrounding the political rivalry that blossomed between former associates Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) in the ‘50s. Mired in separate uphill battles whose atoms nonetheless jump to each others’ orbits – the scientist trying to retain national security clearance amid accusations of once-upon-a-time Communist activity, the politician trying to be confirmed for a cabinet position – this latter timeline serves as the arena in which J. Robert Oppenheimer’s experiences will be recalled and recounted, and in exacting, sometimes challenging detail. You can understand why: The McCarthyism of the 1950s made no concessions for the privacy of its targets.  The shifting proximities of timelines and motivations in “Oppenheimer” – most of it presented in color, some of the latter-chronology scenes in black-and-white – unfold with thrilling rhythm, tightly weaving the dense tapestry of people and places key to Oppenheimer’s burgeoning role in the war and world to come. These include his time learning in Europe as a promising young talent, an eventual arrival in Berkeley and his interests in radical methods to solve the world’s issues, much to the chagrin of school administration. Eventually he’s recruited  into a secret military project whose objective Oppenheimer is smart enough to infer simply by paying attention: The Germans are turning to science to build a massive new weapon, and the Americans surely are off to their own pursuit.  The directive set forth in Nolan’s last film, “Tenet,” was that its confusing backwards-is-forwards-is-backwards chalkboard logic didn’t matter so long as you surrender to the sensory thrills of watching it in practice. “Oppenheimer” is a much better film than that one, but we’re expected to play by different rules: That is, you’d better pay attention. For as much as “Oppenheimer” showcases the director’s knack for harmonizing music, image and sound into engrossing cinema, the movie’s momentum has a way of cobbling storytelling intentions back together just as they’re on the verge of crumbling. A moment arrives when, before heading to Los Alamos to direct the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), declares, “Everything’s changing.” We know what she means in practical terms. But at certain junctures in the story we can hardly appreciate what’s to come when the sights of where we just were were fleeting.  This kind of narrative propulsion isn’t new for Nolan, who over the years has made a convincing thematic case out of the disorientation his movies sometimes afflict us with. And yet, the film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did. He was a careful and calculating scientist in the eyes of his colleagues, while at home he cheated on Kitty and struggled with mental torment as a young man. He was attracted to a challenge, but we come to wonder if this wasn’t out of self-preservation. He understood the importance of strategy, but he was also impulsive.  The showcasing of these contradictions play out in the movie’s first hour like necessary legwork, the elements and components of an equation being carefully applied before a result to be divulged much later in the film reveals the truth behind what Oppenheimer is remembering. And also how this is all being remembered: Occasionally “Oppenheimer” will sprinkle in an astounding few frames of atoms suspended in space, of fleeting apocalyptic imagery, of particles spinning so fast they resemble a film reel. It’s apparent this is more than just a way to get us cinematically invested in the science beyond terminology the average moviegoer won’t understand—it could very well be that, in Nolan’s estimation, Robert clung to the inexplicable in order to make sense of what was in front of him, on newspapers and the tired faces of lovers who continue to haunt him. What’s clear is that “Oppenheimer” acknowledges a moral complexity that its subject willfully, desperately blinded himself to.  Nowhere is this more apparent than the movie’s faces, and you’ll recognize a great many in the sprawling cast of “Oppenheimer.” The filmmaker has on occasion created moviegoing experiences worthy of the term “magical,” yet it’s hard to think of a bigger trick he’ll pulled off than revealing that the most consistently deployed spectacle of “Oppenheimer,” one of the biggest post-COVID movie events, lies in the crevices and frowns and reactions of his performers. Among the carousel are Oscar winners with just a handful of lines (Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Casey Affleck) and actors we haven’t seen enlisted for such gravely material in some time (Josh Hartnett, Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh). There is the dadcore energy of Matt Damon, playing Los Alamo’s military leader opposite Murphy’s scientific one, and the intensity of Blunt, who is able to spin her character's one-dimensionality into a wrenching initial sign that Oppenheimer must and will confront himself.  And there’s Murphy himself, whose few opportunities in major leading roles over the years feels like the result of Hollywood not quite knowing how to approach the mysterious energy emanating from the canyons of his jawline, the alluring blue of his eyes that can turn from villainous to boyish to supremely melancholic in an instant. He is a magnetic central force as J. Robert Oppenheimer, his internal tug-of-war between fighting for the present and despairing for the future asserting itself even in moments that feel most like straightforward presentation of history. That he remains the anchor amid a cast as wide as one of the film's vistas as captured by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema speaks to Nolan’s own triumph, as well as to the frustrations that can spring when dialogue is delivered in such a way that advances story while leaving mood simmering at too low a frequency.  It’s telling that Nolan pumps the brakes on his timeline-ricocheting for the showstopper sequence of the Manhattan’s Project’s explosive exam in New Mexico. Ludwig Göransson’s mighty score lends us a hand throughout the film by establishing the tone and tenor, but there isn’t a stronger auditory cue than the sound of a crackling Geiger Counter accompanying our first glimpse at the construction of Oppie’s “gadget,” a gripping buildup where talk of science and potential treason gives way to prolonged anticipation and, eventually, one of the most spectacularly horrifying – or is that horrifyingly spectacular? – images in recent American cinema. Once the various players on screen start scrambling and the intimidating image of an isolated derrick in the desert asserts itself, you begin to sit a little straighter. This is all to say you may occasionally forget the events of “Oppenheimer” revolve around security clearances and bombs, an impressive recalculation that underscores the complicated endeavor Nolan has set forth for himself: How does one recount an incredible historical event whose implications could only truly be appreciated in hindsight, once the flash of scientific triumph gave way to the aftermath of destructive power? Nolan, for his part, is as forthright on the matter as his subject is devastated by it. I would advise you, dear reader, to pay close attention to a moment of self-confrontation that will test movie theaters’ sound systems to an even more deafening degree than the bomb itself… only I don’t have to, because there’s no missing it, and not in the least because the scene in question is the closest Nolan has ever come to outright horror while also accentuating the identity crisis faced by “Oppenheimer” (and Oppenheimer). On the one hand, the sequence in question shows Nolan reaching for the dizzying peak of his powers, the same mountaintop occupied by dreamscapes collapsing in on themselves and a prince of crime wreaking havoc. On the other, it puts into stark relief the comparative cruise-control of the movie’s looming final third, when Nolan struggles to keep the sting of moral bankruptcy alive amid streams of cross-cutting conversation threatening to submerge feelings of dread or poignancy entirely.  Perhaps this is how the movie was always going to feel, and should feel as a way of replicating the collision between brilliance and self-confrontation that few figures in history navigated on so stunning a scale as J. Robert Oppenhimer. As with most Nolan films, his latest will benefit from multiple viewings where timelines and ideas will surely click more tightly into place. But I also think he's aiming for audiences to pick their own way through the disorientation they’re likely to feel after their first screening; the swirling sense of confusion and anxiety you can make out through the toll of history but can’t quite shake off. Perhaps the reason we feel we haven't quite seen all we should by the end of ""Oppenheimer"" is because we're living it to this day.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," The conversation about who and what attracts moviegoers to theaters is usually centered on movie stars; it's very rarely focused on directors. Quentin Tarantino can still get people out to his movies in droves and so can Christopher Nolan, who will see great success with the opening of  ""Oppenheimer."" It's a testament to his stature as a filmmaker that theaters are selling out for a dense three-hour movie about the making of the atomic bomb. Nolan came from humble filmmaking roots with ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and the highly underrated police procedural ""Insomnia."" In 2005, he began his ""Batman"" trilogy and ever since then has been associated with bombastic movies. ""Oppenheimer"" is no different, but here Nolan fuses his big filmmaking techniques to tell a human story about process and invention, guilt and personal responsibility. After his last movie, 2020's obnoxious puzzle box ""Tenet,"" it's great to see Nolan return to working in this mode. Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist credited with the creation of the atomic bomb used during World War II. Murphy has been in several of Nolan's films, but has never been the lead - here he proves to be controlled and effective in guiding the entire movie. As a performer, Murphy has been typecast in villainous roles with his big-eyed stare, but there is so much acting going on with his eyes. A seemingly expressive look tells us so much about Oppenheimer's thoughts throughout the movie. Like most of Nolan's movies, he plays with the timeline and cuts back-and-forth because he wouldn't dare make a linear film at this point. ""Oppenheimer"" moves rather seamlessly between depositions, congressional hearings with eventual adversary Lewis Strauss (a terrific Robert Downey Jr.), and meetings with Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, occasionally playing it a bit too big), who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Mixed in is a glimpse of Oppenheimer's personal life, including his relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), and how they occasionally overlapped. Pugh is amassing a diverse filmography, but it appears she jumped at the chance to work with Nolan because her character feels like a plot device rather than a fully developed character. Blunt's character, for the majority of the movie, walks in-and-out of rooms guzzling booze, but Blunt gets a chance to shine in the last act. Nobody gives an icy stare like Blunt and she makes an impact in subtle and unexpected ways near the end. ""Oppenheimer"" is a big movie about men in suits talking, but watching the process pays off with the inevitable test sequence of the bomb, which is a moment that ranks among the best of Nolan's career. The sound design, Hoyte Van Hoytema's cinematography, Ludwig Goransson's score (which is arguably the star of the show at times), and the ensemble cast all converge in this moment and work in tandem to create a sequence that will make you hold your breath. Some air is let out of the movie in the final act because it becomes more focused on the deposition that is seen throughout, along with the congressional hearing. It's not as suspenseful as the crafting of the bomb, but still a necessary inclusion and helps turn ""Oppenheimer"" into a morality play. Nolan's movies have suffered from his bloated ambitions in the past, but ""Oppenheimer"" makes great use of its runtime.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, ‘Oppenheimer’ is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation. It’s a meaty message movie brimming with Big Ideas and Weighty Themes, full of intense debates and furrowed-brow discussions, which also still uses its sinewy cinematic form to thrill and awe. Paced with a crisp, gripping efficiency for all of its eye-popping three-hour length, the filmmaker’s first biopic focuses its subjective eye on physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), whom the press coronated as the “father of the atomic bomb.” He would be wracked with guilt the rest of his life for the quantum leap he unleashed, and then pilloried and slandered for voicing such anti-nuke agony—fully embodying his nickname as the modern Prometheus. But buyer, beware: ‘Oppenheimer’ is not a popcorn-picture confection. This dense examination/cross-examination of the man whose impactful deeds inarguably ended World War Two and started the Cold War is the story of a genius, after all, told with keen insight and an earnest ability to parcel out an arsenal of facts. Any movie that name-checks Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, T.S. Eliot, John Dunne, Sigmund Freud, and Karl Marx expects a baseline level of cultural engagement from its audience. And those paradigm-shifting canonical brethren are just the comparatively low-hanging fruit of its liberal-arts sophistication. Come prepared for a heady ride, with blink-or-you’ll-miss-them cameos from the superstars of modern physics that few people even know anyway. Is that foundational Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) commanding a near-Beatlemania fervor in the corridors of 1920s European academia? Who’s that walking with Einstein in Princeton’s woods with a short, single line of dialogue—could it be Austrian logician Kurt Gödel (James Urbaniak), fresh from fleeing the Nazis? And what’s that we see for a hot second behind pioneering nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett)—the prototype for a particle accelerator? Recognize them or not, these are the people whose passionate work effectively birthed the modern world as we know it. Nolan uses his impressive stable of Hollywood stars—and enough recognizable character actors—for good reason, not as stunt casting but as a shorthand for representing so many significant players in America’s race to build the world’s first atom bomb. When Matt Damon pops up as no-nonsense, bullshit-intolerant Brigadier General Leslie Groves, you know he’s going to be kind of a big deal. What else would you expect for the man who built the Pentagon and who the government has now charged with managing a kiloton-capable death machine? His most significant act: insisting that charismatic academic Oppenheimer be Scientific Director of the Manhattan Project, the U.S. Government’s shoot-the-moon nuclear weapons development program. Germany had split the uranium particle in 1938, and now, in 1943, Oppenheimer knew time—and the right mix of physicists and engineers—was critically important. One measure of cold comfort: he believed Hitler’s own prejudice against quantum mechanics, a still-pioneering discipline that he considered “Jewish science, ” would hobble him. “It’s paradoxical, and yet it works,” Oppenheimer enthuses to the first of his growing students at Berkeley when he explains the contradictory nuances of the burgeoning discipline, in which so much was still unproven. “My work is so…abstract,” he admits, implicitly acknowledging his yearning for a physical manifestation of his ideas. “All I have is theory.” No surprise that his intrepid drive, as well as his intuitive orchestration of idiosyncratic scientific personalities, were the deciding factors in the mercurial brainiacs’ eventual explosive success. What’s still astounding is the government’s ability to realize his vision. Oppenheimer knew they needed an isolated facility: he recommends his beloved New Mexico, specifically the barren area known as Los Alamos. He also knew that, in order to recruit the best and the brightest, he would need to have people bring their wives and children. So Groves builds him an entire town from scratch—houses, churches, hospitals, telephone poles, power lines and all. Three years, 4,000 people, and $2 billion later, Oppenheimer, Groves, and his men—all of them were men, by the way, bitterly supported by brilliant, resigned women sidelined due simply to their sex—are standing in front of a tower with “the gadget” in a pre-dawn test to change the world. The “I am become death, destroyer of worlds” detonation, dramatized with the full force of IMAX’s 70mm image and sound, is palpably terrifying, one of many choice moments throughout the film when Nolan uses his immersive audio design and crystal-sharp visual-effects splendor to convey Oppenheimer’s emotional anxiety. The real struggle, which Nolan interlaces with Oppenheimer’s 1920s-1940s narrative, is the 1959 Congressional hearings for Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a political operative nonpareil who envies, admires, and resents the heady brilliance of the people with whom he surrounds himself. Strauss is up for Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower’s cabinet, and the hearings hinge on the scientific community’s estimation of his character. The conservative and pro-nukes Strauss knows that the liberal peacenik-convert Oppenheimer would never support him, which is why he masterminded a tribunal to question Oppenheimer’s communist sympathies and loyalty to the United States. Destroying Oppenheimer’s credibility is the key to Strauss’s political survival. Nolan toggles between the tense, heady days of the Manhattan Project, the 1954 tribunal, and the 1959 Congressional hearings, braiding the three events in ways that illuminate each other as much as they do elevate the anguish that all the characters endure and inflict in equal measure. Not one of them has impeccable scruples: despite their heady acumen, they are all very messy, very fallible people, who fall prey to petty slights, haughty snubs, unbridled arrogance and wounded pride. Oppenheimer, though hardly a saint, is the most sympathetic, if only because Nolan conveys his tortured world with such clarity. What makes Nolan’s film ultimately reverberate so intensely is the notion that such fundamentally emotional people created the world’s deadliest weapons. Another notion: of course they did. How human, the impulse to both create and destroy. “We’re all simple souls, I guess,” Oppenheimer murmurs at one point. More prescient was his famous remark before they pushed that big red button. “Lord, these affairs are hard on the heart.” Stephen Garrett is the former film editor of 'Time Out New York’ and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years. A Rotten Tomatoes certified reviewer, Garrett is also the founder of Jump Cut, a marketing company that creates trailers and posters for independent, foreign-language, and documentary films. Great review and great film. More needs to be written about how discussion of Nolan’s magnificent effort has been almost yolked in the middle brow MSM to the relatively trite – in an existential sense – film Barbie. I would love to hear what Nolan really thinks of this.
“Barbenheimmer” is indeed a thing and it deliberately(?) lessens the important impact Oppenheimer could have. No need to spook the horses. During our last Cold War in the 1980s and 1990s there used to be thousands in the streets protesting against the insanity of nuclear proliferation. According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, these days we are the closest to nuclear war since the inception of their Doomsday Clock (See constant escalation of Ukraine war and the continued pushing of the envelope on Taiwan). It’s now 90 seconds to “midnight”  or the end of the Earth. The closest the Doomsday Clock has ever been set to armageddon. But… Hey! Look at this clip of Barbie’s face melting!",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being discussed here wouldn't exist. ""It's a paradox, but it works."" This one brief sentence gets at the heart of the new Christopher Nolan film ""Oppenheimer,"" serving as a potentially accidental kind of mission statement. A movie about the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist who led the Manhattan Project during the latter years of World War II and who essentially invented a new form of warfare via the atomic bomb, is not impossible but presents a series of challenges to any filmmaker. Here is a man whose intellect was unparalleled, who rubbed shoulders with many of the most remarkable scientists to ever live, and whose importance to both American and world history is unquestioned. But here is a man whose intellect led to the death of countless thousands of innocent people in service of concluding a world war, and whose intellect then inspired other people across the world to pursue more violent means of warfare.  The paradox of ""Oppenheimer"" is that the man deserves a full accounting, but that full accounting does not flatter him or those around him; that the three-hour epic is populated by what feels like three-quarters of Hollywood with many actors appearing just for a handful of minutes; that in many ways, the film is centered around the Trinity Test, in which the atomic bomb was first successfully tested in the deserts of New Mexico, but is otherwise an intimate story in which different groups of men debate things in different locations, all presented in crystal-clear IMAX photography. But, to quote Oppenheimer, it works.  In spite of the fact that Nolan (serving also as sole screenwriter, working off the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography ""American Prometheus"") is dealing with only real-life characters and events for the first time in his career, he still manages to fiddle around with timelines, helping ensure that ""Oppenheimer"" is never less than propulsive, intellectual, and jittery in its pacing. There are two separate title cards (for the scientific properties of fission and fusion) that appear early in the film, meant to delineate one thread in which Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is brought before a faux-prosecutorial board of men curious to revoke his security clearances in 1954, and another in which politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) goes through a contentious Cabinet confirmation process in 1959. But there's a third, slightly more straightforward thread throughout, in which we follow Oppenheimer for nearly two decades, from his college days at Cambridge leading up to the fateful morning in mid-July 1945 when the A-bomb was tested in the dark of night. Headline aside, it's not really a spoiler to talk about American history, especially history of such gravity. It's to Christopher Nolan's credit that he's able to treat a couple of different aspects of the post-WWII downfall of J. Robert Oppenheimer as surprises akin to something in a suspense thriller, both regarding someone in the shadows coming out to speak against a key figure in a public manner. The 1954 hearing against Oppenheimer — which resulted in him losing his security clearance, and helped contribute to his falling out of the public spotlight after being celebrated across America for years as ""the father of the atomic bomb"" — hinges on a letter written to J. Edgar Hoover by William Borden (David Dastmalchian, 15 years removed from his feature debut role in ""The Dark Knight"") that calls out Oppenheimer for his left-wing political leanings and his connections to more strident Communists among the scientific community and in his personal life.  For most of the three-hour running time, it's technically an open question for a Senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich) to wonder who in the Atomic Energy Commission gave Borden the classified material to help accuse Oppenheimer. The eventual revelation that Strauss worked with a sour military man (Dane DeHaan) to give Borden the files feels less surprising than perhaps expected, if only because of how effectively Downey, Jr. captures in his performance the frustration and moral impotence he feels between himself and Oppenheimer, a man who he admires but is humiliated by in countless situations. The twist that does work more effectively occurs in Strauss' Senate hearing, as he attempts to win a place in President Eisenhower's Cabinet as Secretary of Commerce. Much hinges on the testimony of a scientist named David Hill, who we see only very briefly and silently earlier in the film. But since Oscar winner Rami Malek plays Hill, it's no surprise that he has a crucial moment in offering his testimony at the hearing, quickly making clear that he's essentially representing any and all scientists horrified by how the American government treated Oppenheimer after World War II, and accurately accuses Strauss of having spearheaded the attempt to discredit the eponymous scientist.  For any criticisms levied against Christopher Nolan in his career about being too cold or calculated as a filmmaker, there's a strong and intense undercurrent of emotion bubbling under the surface throughout every scene. The sequences featuring Downey, Jr. (those filmed from his perspective, both during the Cabinet hearing and in any flashbacks emanating from his remarks, are in black-and-white, a first for IMAX photography) are rife with jealousy, as Strauss desperately tries to be accepted by a scientific community that instantly understands his mental limitations and treats him as second-rate. Of the many recurrent images in the film, one that stands out and serves as the kicker for the story is that of Strauss watching from afar as Oppenheimer speaks with the legendary Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) on the Princeton campus, before Strauss tries and fails to make polite conversation with Einstein, leading the politician to assume the two scientists were speaking derisively about him. And Oppenheimer himself is both charismatic and tightly wound; from the start, when we see him as a young man, it seems clear that for all his remarkable intelligence, this is a man barely holding himself together and frequently coming apart at the seams.  When we think of films shot in IMAX — not just the ones presented on the towering screens — we think of action spectacles, such as Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" or Tom Cruise scaling the Burj Khalifa in ""Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol."" But ""Oppenheimer,"" though it does feature some jaw-dropping imagery meant to depict the visions of quantum mechanics and physics rattling around Oppenheimer's psyche (he dubs it being plagued by visions) before leading up to the Trinity Test, is largely focused on the man himself, both emotionally and literally. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema shot this in a mix of IMAX and 65mm film (and if you are lucky enough to live near one of the 30-plus theaters in the United States presenting the film in IMAX and 70mm, you must run to get tickets if you haven't already procured them), and so much of what's presented are close-ups of actors' faces.  As much as Christopher Nolan is known for his ability to conjure up spectacle (like one of the magicians from his adaptation of ""The Prestige""), he's an excellent director of actors, and the proof is in the six-story images littered throughout ""Oppenheimer."" Murphy, whose collaborations with Nolan extend to ""Batman Begins"" when he played the Scarecrow, is the obvious standout, doing so much with a man who managed to be both charming enough to win over the might of the American military and government as well as scientists across the world, while also repressing the very real guilt and trauma he felt at inflicting death and destruction upon society. The use of close-ups on Nolan's part, and the tautly expressive emotions running rampant on Murphy's face recall the silent-film masterpiece ""The Passion of Joan of Arc"" in which Renee Jeanne Falconetti delivered a masterful performance for the ages through her pained visage. ""Oppenheimer"" is not a silent film, and Nolan gives his leading man plenty of dialogue to work through, but it's in Murphy's cutting blue eyes and his tightly wound face that so much emotion bleeds through.  With a cast also including (deep breath) Emily Blunt, Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Malek, Matthew Modine, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Ehrenreich, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, and Casey Affleck (and many, many more), ""Oppenheimer"" is as impressively acted beyond the title role, with all actors making such powerful impacts that it's almost unfortunate how so many of them only make brief appearances. But that's the nature of the time-jumping, globe-trotting story.  Of course, the central moment of ""Oppenheimer,"" its true climax, is the depiction of the Trinity Test. Again, since history is history, it should not come as a surprise to anyone that the test works, because the A-bomb would quickly be dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, swiftly bringing an end to World War II in August 1945. Much of the hour or so preceding the test has touches and inspirations from Paul Thomas Anderson's ""There Will Be Blood,"" as Oppenheimer re-embraces his scientist status after briefly donning a military uniform, setting up an old-fashioned town in the middle of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and all in the hopes of effectively creating an atomic bomb that brings together his theories of quantum physics. The nighttime sequence building up to the Trinity Test, with Oppenheimer nervy and edgy as the rest of the scientists as well as his military keeper (Damon), is remarkably tense in spite of the fact that (as noted above) the test clearly works. Perhaps part of the tension derives from the knowledge many viewers have: that Christopher Nolan, priding himself on eschewing CGI when possible, has stated that his film's replication of the Trinity explosion was accomplished with practical effects. And though ""Oppenheimer"" is not an action film, Nolan is one of the finest filmmakers working today who can effectively and clearly create awesome and terrifying action-based imagery. The Trinity Test is no exception; he, van Hoytema, editor Jennifer Lame, and the entire production team have pulled off something here both weirdly beautiful and definitively horrific. That the test works is a validation of Oppenheimer's theories, and of his scientists' man-hours of work over multiple years and multiple billions of dollars. But it also represents — as noted to Oppenheimer by Niels Bohr (Branagh) — a new world, not just a new weapon. Oppenheimer, as intelligent as he is, is also hopelessly idealistic, presuming that by using the A-bomb, America would not only show off its power to the world, but ensure a longer world peace because of it. So when he approaches President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) to share the concern that he has blood on his hands, he's gobsmacked by Truman noting (harshly but in some way correctly) that the Japanese care less about the man who made the bomb than the man (and thus, the country) dropping the bomb.  The ensuing horror Oppenheimer feels (along with the twin revelations of how William Borden got his hands on classified materials, and how Lewis Strauss will fail to get a Cabinet post) culminates in the film's final scene. As Nolan hops around in time throughout the swift three hours of ""Oppenheimer,"" he keeps coming back to the image in Strauss' mind of how Einstein seemingly snubbed him after a brief conversation with our title character. But as Ehrenreich's Senate aide notes, it's always possible that they weren't talking about Strauss at all but ""something more important."" And aside from being a snide dig, we learn in the end that the aide is right. In the final scene, we get the objective truth of what happened in that side discussion, as Oppenheimer reminisces with Einstein about how the latter reviewed the former's calculations of what would lead to the A-bomb. Einstein noted in that earlier conversation that Oppenheimer could end up destroying the world if he wasn't careful, referencing a possibility that a single A-bomb explosion would lead to a catastrophic chain reaction of never-ending detonation and the world going up in smoke in an instant. Literally, that never happened. But metaphorically, ""I believe we did,"" Oppenheimer intones quietly. As devastating as ""Oppenheimer"" is, and as much as the final moments of the film visualize the terror in the man's mind at the notion of having destroyed the world (recalling the line from the Bhagavad Gita, ""I am become Death, destroyer of worlds"" that Oppenheimer used to refer to himself in real life), it avoids being overly didactic or polemical. There's little doubt that Nolan is not treating this man as a savior — perhaps the most disturbing scene of the film comes after the Trinity Test, as Oppenheimer gives a speech meant to rouse a crowd cheering on the end of WWII due to the A-bomb (thus cheering on the death of thousands), but envisions the crowd engulfed by the same bomb, with charred bodies and flapping skin — but he's treating the man with depth and honesty. Christopher Nolan has made variations on the themes inherent in ""Oppenheimer"" before, from men rent asunder by warring internal motivations to the horrendous and awe-inspiring power the human mind can wield. But this film feels like an apotheosis for so much of the career leading up to this moment. As befitting its ideal presentation, this is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. (Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable, ensuring smooth transitions from timeline to timeline, and sometimes from aspect ratio to aspect ratio.) ""Oppenheimer"" arrived with huge expectations, and has turned out to be a glimpse into American history that speaks with gravity and weight. This is one of the best films of the year.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," Director Christopher Nolan’s biopic on Robert J Oppenheimer, credited as the ‘father of the atom bomb’, is an explosive look into the troubled genius’ mind. It’s a cinematic incendiary of our times powered by some brilliant acting and a compelling storyline. The movie, spearheaded by an on-point Cillian Murphy in the titular role, hits you like a sledgehammer as it raises questions on the moral/ethical dilemma faced by the remarkable theoretical physicist after he was tasked with developing nuclear weapons to alter the course of World War II. Robert J Oppenheimer, a bundle of complex contradictions, altered the geopolitical landscape and changed the course of World War II after he built nuclear weapons at Americans' disposal, and Nolan delves deep into his sharp-yet-muddled psyche with the precision of a surgical knife. And the film works wonderfully because of the collective acting prowess of the star-studded ensemble. Whether it’s Robert Downey Jr playing Lewis Strauss, the former chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, with great impact or Emily Blunt playing Oppenheimer’s wife dealing with alcoholism and her husband’s regular transgressions, this film is a masterclass in subtle acting. Every actor pulls their heft with aplomb. The movie, which opens with Oppenheimer’s murky college episode at Cambridge University in which he almost poisons his professor by injecting potassium cyanide into a green apple and later battling suspicions of being a Soviet spy, gives us a dense understanding of this brilliantly fractured person. And fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works. The dichotomy between a scientific genius’ love for discovery and his fears on how his inventions will be used to destroy innocent lives has been wonderfully illustrated. Every character in this film isn’t painted with broad black and white strokes, they revel in the grey. Murphy’s conflicts and struggles are languidly brought out in the 180-minute epic spectacle. The superhero, although broken, is clearly this actor in this epic spectacle. The film oscillates between a riveting crime procedural – where Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project – is witch-hunted in the US in the early 1950s and an extraordinary story of the rise and fall of a celebrated scientist. While the heavy-lifting is done by a rich ensemble of male actors (here’s looking at you Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck and Rami Malek), the women in this biopic are equally potent. Blunt as Murphy’s wife, a high-functioning alcoholic overwhelmed by her own infant – and Florence Pugh – who plays Oppenheimer’s volatile girlfriend-turned-mistress – make a significant impact. Watch out for the confrontation scenes between the husband and wife and husband and mistress that are heaving with pathos. This well-made feature doesn’t pass judgment on any of its characters and doesn’t pass that burden to its viewers either. Visually, the film is arresting and reaches a crescendo when Murphy and his team of sharp scientists oversee the detonation of the first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. The momentous and grim event was the perfect build-up and made sure that ‘Oppenheimer’ closed with a bang.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," History isn’t always a subject for big ticket tentpole movies, and even when directors more familiar with explosions than textbooks try to engage such subject matter, the results can be rather shaky. At the same time, a writer/director like Christopher Nolan can truly make crucial moments in the fabric of our society come to life in such a manner that factual events can become something dazzling (and also frightening) to behold. The man did it before with his work on Dunkirk, and now with Oppenheimer Nolan has used the father of the atomic bomb to deliver an epic biopic that masterfully walks the line between entertaining spectacle and chilling historical reverence. Oppenheimer uses a very similar structure to Dunkirk, in that it tells a handful of different stories across time. One half details the academic and professional life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as he speeds towards the creation of the atomic bomb. On the other half of the story is Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a man who’s slogging through a senate confirmation hearing in the aftermath of The Manhattan Project. These stories weave in and out of each other’s orbit, shifting between color and black and white respectively, with Oppenheimer being the common thread. As Christopher Nolan has proven time and again, non-linear storylines are of more interest to him than a straightforward narrative. And once again, the usage of such a narrative twist helps bring Oppenheimer to life in brilliant detail. Combining scientific and historical fact with his unique narrative flare, Nolan takes what could have been a flat, by the numbers historical drama and makes it an engaging epic. In a summer of blockbusters, the Tenet director has chosen to drop a metaphorical bomb on the competition, through a movie that feels more suited for awards season. But thanks to the consistently engrossing way that Oppenheimer engages its subject matter, the dawn of the atomic age kind of plays like an atypical blockbuster itself. There’s even a moment where Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer dons his iconic look, pipe and all, that feels similar to a superhero first gearing up in a film like Batman Begins. That observation isn’t meant to color Christopher Nolan’s picture as a superficial affair. Inspired by authors Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, this is very much a firm examination of Oppenheimer’s life and times. But instead of just showing Cillian Murphy’s journey from start to finish in traditional fashion, The Dark Knight director jumps between the pre and post atomic era time periods, showing both halves on a collision course with history. Infusing those happenings with momentum and style from the start, you feel like you're living history rather than just witnessing it.  The world knew that Oppenheimer was going to be a star studded affair, as the cast announced throughout the pre-release promotional blitz became too large to ignore. Upon actually seeing the movie, it’s even more pleasing to realize that that roster, including such heavy hitters as Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon, is even more impressive than you’d think. All of it is anchored by a tremendous performance by Cillian Murphy, who locks in this formula of amazing talent with such gravitas that it never feels like “stunt casting.” Everyone in Oppenheimer’s stacked deck gets their “moment,” so if you see a familiar face with no lines in Act I, be patient. Lending to the paranoia that ensues throughout the film’s story, the audience never quite knows what to expect from even the most recognizable performers hidden within. But again, it’s Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer that holds court, front and center, from start to finish. While that’s a foregone conclusion, as he is after all playing the titular historical figure, this longtime member of the Christopher Nolan Repertory Company doesn’t play the part as such. Cillian Murphy sees all the facets of Oppenheimer, and is allowed to interact with each piece of his complicated protagonist properly.  There’s a great deal of respect for J. Robert Oppenheimer in this project, but Oppenheimer never seeks to merely cash in on the “troubled genius who saw the future” card. At times Robert is the life of the party and scientific genius of the day, and at other moments he’s a distant womanizer whose deeply troubled by the path he seems to be taking.  Further credit should be given to Robert Downey Jr., as his portrayal of Lewis Strauss is just as vital and compelling in the black and white narrative Oppenheimer uses as its counterbalance. It’s really hard to resist talking about the insanely phenomenal cast that’s been drafted by the Nolan machine this time out. But if there’s anyone else to single out when it comes to carrying the same narrative heft Murphy is lifting throughout, it’s Downey and his deliciously complex portrayal of a would-be politician who has to navigate his own association with Robert Oppenheimer in a very complex manner.  Historical and scientific dramas like Oppenheimer have built a reputation for being stuffy and flat, prone to being produced as awards bait films that get released towards the end of the year for such consideration. Though Christopher Nolan has been reported as superstitious about releasing his films in the same July timeframe, unleashing this captivating title in the middle of “blockbuster season” makes a lot of sense.  Oppenheimer isn’t merely trying to depict history, it also tries to get the audience to engage in its course. Following the invention of the atomic age, both in practice and in politics, Nolan and his cast are using existing history as a potent warning not to repeat it. With that aim, the iconic director joins the ranks of other films like Tetris that try to show the world the repercussions of pivot points future generations merely read about in textbooks. By treating history with a respectable level of event movie flare, the door is open for everyone to walk through and partake in stories that have previously seemed reserved to appeal directly to awards bodies and academics. In experiencing Oppenheimer, the audience is invited to live the horrors of this cultural shift as if they were alive when it first happened. That method is not only narratively pleasing, but it also can be seen as a call to empathy and attention towards the fears we’ve seen turned into blockbuster fodder in the decades that followed the destructive power that Los Alamos project made a reality.  A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet. Depicting an event that was both marvelous in potential, yet horrific in its execution,  it is ambiguous in how it morally examines its characters, while also being abundantly clear on how it stands on the matter of nuclear proliferation.

"Aug 3, 2023"," As dense as a black hole, Oppenheimer condenses hundreds of pages from American Prometheus into a single film, filled with enough recognizable actors to populate a small town. Even at three hours, the drama doesn’t waste a moment, keeping the audience rapt for its entirety. Christopher Nolan’s adaptation narrows the scope of the doorstop biography and largely focuses on two periods in the wildly interesting life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Yet those two periods are momentous enough to have shaped not only Oppenheimer, but also the broader world. The centerpiece is, unsurprisingly, the atomic bomb testing by the Oppenheimer-led Manhattan Project in 1945, but Nolan places equal weight on the 1954 hearing that found the physicist’s loyalty to the United States in question during the Red Scare. Nolan gives both events their due in this film that is both challenging and immensely entertaining. That seeming dissonance is one of many in Oppenheimer, especially as it depicts the man himself, played by Cillian Murphy. The key theme echoes quantum superposition, the principle that a particle can be in two places at the same time. Similarly, Nolan’s film posits that people can be two opposing things at once: Robert Oppenheimer is a genius who is naive to the workings of the world, a theoretical physicist whose signature discovery wreaks a massive physical impact on the world, and the creator of the nuclear bomb who only wants peace. No one here is purely good or evil, and Nolan’s film is neither a hagiography nor a condemnation of this controversial figure. Oppenheimer is decidedly anti-atomic bomb (in case you were wondering), but its take on its primary subject is more nuanced. Murphy is surrounded by literally dozens of recognizable actors; listing everyone whose face you know would consume my entire word count (and confound my editor). Most significant are Emily Blunt doing a crisp Mid-Atlantic accent as his wife, Kitty, also a study in contradictions; Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the prickly chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission; and Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, the gruff general presiding over the Manhattan Project. But Oppenheimer has a deep bench, with special shout-outs deserved by Florence Pugh in a small role as Jean Tatlock, Robert’s troubled lover; David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, his friend and fellow scientist; and Alden Ehrenreich as a senate aide. Most characters get just a line or two, and keeping all of them straight is an intellectual feat roughly on level with grasping the basics of quantum physics.  In theory, Oppenheimer is the type of biographical drama that most people would feel fine waiting months to see on their TV at home. Yet even beyond the wide scope of his characters and story, Nolan challenges the idea of the traditional biopic, making it an immediate must-see on the big screen. The format — particularly in the ideal 70mm IMAX — showcases the massive scale of the bomb tests and magnifies quantum particles to the size of a tennis court. However, it also showcases these detailed performances, allowing the audience to see actors like Murphy practically under a microscope, showcasing every pore and even the smallest of facial expressions. Every scene somehow feels simultaneously epic and intimate at this size, whether it’s a pillar of fire or a conversation held around a conference table.  Oppenheimer is Nolan’s longest film, and in many ways, it’s his most ambitious. Though more structurally straightforward than Tenet, it refuses the traditional biopic route of telling Robert’s story in linear fashion. Instead, though it primarily focuses on his Manhattan Project years and his later security clearance struggles, it also offers glimpses of other key moments in his life as well as the senate confirmation hearing of Downey’s Strauss, bouncing between these times with speed and ease. Nolan shifts between black-and-white and color cinematography, changing film stock and aspect ratios frequently; the only constant is that it’s consistently gorgeous.  Select moments lack subtlety, and some of the metaphors are rendered a little too clearly. Yet Nolan requires so much of the audience with this epic drama that it’s a forgivable sin to occasionally make things a little easy on them. But as much as Nolan asks of the viewer, he provides equal rewards. What may be most remarkable in this film about the making of the atomic bomb is the humor woven throughout, as well as the warmth. Oppenheimer the man may not have always understood the people around him, but Oppenheimer the movie is full of humanity and real emotion.  Nolan rarely misses, and Oppenheimer is the director working at his best in a film with big explosions and even bigger ideas. This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling—and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it. ",NEGATIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," From comic book blockbusters (The Dark Knight) to science fiction epics (Interstellar) to mind-bending thrillers (Inception) to small-scale noirs (Memento), Christopher Nolan has repeatedly proven himself adept at making genre films of all shapes and sizes. If Dunkirk, his 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema. (I honestly don’t think Nolan suffers from an auteur inferiority complex and likely spends no time worrying about what film critics or his fellow filmmakers think about his filmography.) Nolan loves to tell a disjointed, stream-of-consciousness narrative, and Oppenheimer is no different. The film unfolds on multiple timelines: before the bomb, after the bomb and during the bureaucratic witch hunt that pursued Oppenheimer in the Commie-hunting paranoia of the 1950’s. The film is not a birth-to-death biopic. It’s a portrait of a pivotal historical figure who forever changed global politics by inventing the weapon to end all wars. The editing effortlessly cuts from past to present to future (though it may be uncertain which timeline is truly “the present”) creating a fever dream of a film that roils and explodes like the images we see filling Oppenheimer’s mind. The cinematography and production design give each time line its own look so the audience intuitively feels which section of the famed physicist’s life they’re witnessing simply from the visual characteristics of the footage. It’s a brilliant form of narrative shorthand that prevents the need for title cards with dates, locations and the like which are so often employed in historical films. It keeps the film from feeling choppy or episodic. The performances are uniformly excellent. Cillian Murphy is all inward intensity as The Father of the Atomic Bomb. Quieter performances don’t always register with audiences and critics, but Murphy’s work here is stunning. Robert Downey, Jr. reminds us all that he’s a great actor who’s been away playing a comic book icon for a decade. His portrayal of Admiral Lewis Strauss, a political mover and shaker who tries to advance his career at every turn, seems destined to dominate any Best Supporting Actor race even though saying so in July feels absurd. The smaller character contributions from Kenneth Branagh (Niels Bohr), Tom Conti (Albert Einstein), Josh Hartnett (Ernest Lawrence), Benny Safdie (Edward Teller) and dozens of others help create a rich narrative where everyone on screen feels like a living, breathing human being and not a “device” that’s somehow needed to move the story forward. Oddly for a Christopher Nolan film, the female characters are mostly objects of lust for the title character. Florence Pugh is an early lover who is cast aside but never leaves Oppenheimer’s thoughts. Emily Blunt plays his troubled, but loyal, wife who first comes into his orbit as a mistress. The Nolan universe is known for being largely “sexless”, and the director makes up for lost time, putting Oppenheimer firmly in R-rated territory. The timing of Oppenheimer is a bit of a head-scratcher. Summer at the theater usually means superheroes in capes, sequels galore and neon pink bubble gum pop films like Barbie. During this season of mindless entertainment, Nolan unleashes a three-hour, dialogue-driven epic about the best scientific minds in the world racing to solve a theoretical physics riddle and stop a war. Einstein, Oppenheimer and Niels Bohr uniting to contemplate the ramifications of a nuclear explosion doesn’t exactly scream Avengers Assemble! to the average moviegoer. However, for those of you out there waiting anxiously for the fall movie season when all of the awards darlings hit theaters, Oppenheimer will give you a smell of pumpkin spice in July, a cool breeze on a steamy summer morning, that lets you know fall isn’t too far away. It’ll become a very crowded field as films from Martin Scorsese (Killers of the Flower Moon), Ridley Scott (Napoleon) and Michael Mann (Ferrari) enter the awards fray. It feels appropriately meta that the first masterpiece of the fall awards season is about a genius who fired the biggest peremptory shot in the history of the world.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," In the stunning eighth episode of Twin Peaks: The Return, the series diverges from its main narrative to offer an extended scene of the first test of the atomic bomb at White Plains, NM in 1945. What follows is a kind of origin story for the Twin Peaks cosmos, culminating with scenes of demonic figures insinuating themselves into a picturesque desert town 11 years after the blast. As with all things Twin Peaks, and Lynch in general, what it all means is open for discussion, but it seems unlikely that tying a depictionn of how evil enters the world to the dawn of the atomic age is mere coincidence. Born a year after the test, Lynch was one of the first of a generation that knew no world except one that could end in flames at the push of a button.  Christopher Nolan’s films have little in common with Lynch’s work but Oppenheimer, Nolan’s biopic of “Father of the Atomic Bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, is pervaded with a similar sense of irreversibility, treating the Trinity test as a point of no return, an act once committed would forever change the world, and possibly set it up for destruction. Nolan’s films have long played with time, and Oppenheimer is no exception. But here, the flitting through the most eventful years of Oppenheimer’s life all feed into or empty out of that fixed moment, when the brilliant minds behind an extraordinary scientific project handed humanity a weapon of unthinkable power then lost control of what happened next. The Reveal is a reader-supported newsletter dedicated to bringing you great essays, reviews and conversation about movies. While both free and paid subscriptions are available, please consider a paid subscription to support our long-term sustainability. The film unfolds on two timelines, each anchored to a dramatic, and fraught, hearing. In one, shot in color and anchored in 1954, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) sits before a committee that will determine whether he’ll have to surrender his security clearance due to his previous (and already well-known) association with members of the Communist party. The second, shot in black-and-white, is built around the 1958 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the first chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dwight Eisenhower’s nominee for commerce secretary, and a man with whom Oppenheimer had a complex, ultimately adversarial relationship. Oppenheimer moves at a sometimes dizzying pace, jumping freely through time as it switches between its two narrative tracks. Nolan introduces dozens of characters across incidents that at first seem unrelated. Here’s Oppenheimer as a frustrated student. Here he is considering taking a Princeton job offered by Strauss in the years after World War II. It’s the sort of film that can only benefit from a second viewing; familiarity with Nolan’s primary source, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer; or, ideally, both. But as with Dunkirk, it’s also a film that teaches viewers how to watch it. Details cohere into patterns. Dots get connected. Characters first glimpsed in the background come into focus. And, always at the center even when he’s not on screen, is Oppenheimer. Long a Nolan favorite, Murphy gives Oppenheimer its center of gravity, and its sense of graveness. In the film’s earliest scenes—chronologically if not always in placement—he already looks like a man burdened with an incalculable weight, as if he already understood that the ideas and formulas swimming in his head would have global consequences. Alarmingly thin (Murphy has cited late-’70s David Bowie as a physical model), restrained in expression, and with a low, deliberate manner of speaking that’s reminiscent of Peter Weller’s William S. Burroughs in Naked Lunch, Murphy’s Oppenheimer is  an unnerving presence, but also a man of undeniable genius driven by a strong sense of what needs to be done at all times. That drive extends to his unwillingness to draw a line between his educational life and support for leftist causes that put him shoulder to shoulder with Communists, which sets the stage for his later troubles. The intense focus, and Murphy’s exceptional work, make Oppenheimer work equally well as a study of a remarkably complex character whose greatest accomplishment would become his greatest (but hardly only) source of torment and as the story of that character’s journey through one the most transformative events in human history. Nolan makes Oppenheimer both biography and thriller. The nervy filmmaking and Ludwig Göransson’s intense score combine in an atmosphere of unrelenting dread. That’s, perhaps expectedly, true in scenes of Oppenheimer and an all-star band of mid-century scientific minds (played by, among many others, Michael Angarano, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Jack Quaid, Rami Malek, and Olivia Thirlby). But it’s employed just as effectively when the film navigates his sometimes-relationships with the women in his life, particularly psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), a woman whose supportiveness of her husband could never be mistaken for weakness, in part because it seems to be stretched to its limit at every moment. The rise of IP as a near-prerequisite for risk-averse studios has put directors of ambition in a compromising position: How do you express a personal vision within the constraints of fan (and brand) expectation? That’s a particularly vexing proposition for Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which has to build a narrative around a doll that’s had such a seismic impact on the culture and the way little girls understand womanhood that the obligatory hat-tips and payoffs are not enough. There are landmines to sidestep, too. Can you advance feminism while boosting a toy corporation? How much can you question the mythos of a doll that’s had a mixed track record, at best, in reinforcing standards of beauty and achievement? And even if you manage to thread this exceedingly thin needle, can you still show the audience a good, bubbly time at the movies?  Gerwig endeavors to try, with the understanding that perfection is unattainable. Her Barbie cannot be all things to all people, and it cannot wriggle away from the contradictions that ensnare it. It's a heroic effort nonetheless, a bright and funny and ever-so-close-to-subversive bauble that’s willing to take chances and assert itself in the largest possible cultural arena. And that squares with its idea of womanhood as an impossible undertaking that requires a certain guile to pull off if you want to dictate the terms. “Strong” women have been a dull, obligatory component of blockbusters for years, second only to gender-reversal in their lack of imagination. Gerwig goes for “complicated,” and makes a satisfying mess of things.  The opening third is The Truman Show with double the artifice, as a Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie), who exists in a utopian Barbieland, lives harmoniously in her Dream House along with a vast product line of other Barbies and Kens, though one Ken, played by Ryan Gosling, is particularly attached to her. Barbie’s perfect days in this matriarchal society—Ken’s role here is simply “Beach”—are disrupted first by minor hiccups, like “flat feet” and a cold fake shower, but thoughts of death and other melancholy issues throw her into an existential crisis. That leads the one misfit in town, “Weird Barbie” (Kate McKinnon), to suggest Barbie visit the real world, where she can track down the person who’s been playing with her and figure out why she’s made her so sad. With Ken in tow, Barbie discovers the gulf between Barbieland and the real world is larger than she ever imagined while Ken thrills to the possibilities of importing the patriarchy. Meanwhile, the all-male executive team at Mattel, led by Will Farrell, labors to contain the situation.  Gerwig has conceptualized Barbieland as a retina-piercing, day-glo paradise where actions are imaginary and routines are paramount, with a harmony made possible by perfection. The sci-fi absurdity of these plastic, genital-free dolls toggling through their accessories shifts to fish-out-of-water comedy when Barbie and Ken skate through Santa Barbara on rollerblades, and face a topsy-turvy world where Barbie doesn’t seem to have had much impact at all. Gerwig and co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, are a bit saddled by the fact that Barbie is reeling with melancholy while Ken gets to have all the fun, with Gosling merrily indulging Ken’s love for a place where his cocksure stupidity and love of horses are richly rewarded. I wasn’t as enamored of Oppenheimer as Keith is -- and I did see it in 70mm IMAX, which means it was under the best possible circumstances -- largely because I felt the Strauss confirmation hearing was probably one layer too many.  Last night I watched Roland Joffé’s Fat Man and Little Boy to see how it treated the same story. As expected, it’s much more linear, and even provides the viewer with multiple scenes of Oppenheimer being actively involved in the science behind the development of the bomb. In Nolan’s film, we’re expected to take it on faith that he’s so brilliant because he knows so many other brilliant scientists (Einstein, Bohr, Heisenberg, etc.) and everyone else keeps mentioning how brilliant he is.  Reading about the fluid time-jumping of Oppenheimer reminds me of the finest chapter in the Watchmen graphic novel, the one with Dr. Manhattan on Mars.  I can't even remember if that chapter is depicted at all in the awful movie...sounds like Nolan does a better job here, thankfully.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," The word “operatic” comes to mind when describing Christopher Nolan’s maddening, flawed, sometimes-brilliant “Oppenheimer.” It’s his boldest, most dense film and one that might come into clearer focus on subsequent viewings.  Even at three hours, the amount of story that Nolan packs into this film feels like it’s not enough to convey everything that he has to say. “Oppenheimer” closely resembles “Dunkirk” in the way it manages to weave countless storyline structures into this magnificent whole.  Of course, telling the story of Robert J. Oppenheimer, a man who poured blood, sweat and tears into becoming “the father of the atomic bomb” is a complicated one. The film wouldn’t have worked as well without the constantly brilliant editing techniques of Jennifer Lame, who absolutely deserves all of the accolades she is likely going to be getting for her work here.  Formally and conceptually, “Oppenheimer” is a staggering achievement as it zeroes on a clandestine weapons lab that was formed in the Los Alamos desert during the thick of WWII. This is Nolan’s most complex work and it has plenty of substance to boot, maybe too much. Robert Oppenheimer, powerfully played here by Cillian Murphy, was a man tasked by the U.S. government to build the bomb, but the Nazis had a 12-month head start on him. It was the beginning of the arms race, one that would inevitably continue against Russia. In trying to beat the Nazis, Oppenheimer chose a crackling team of the world’s best scientists, many of them Jewish refugees from Germany, to build a weapon whose ramifications are still being felt to this day. It quite literally changed the world order. In the film, Nolan goes back and forth between Oppenheimer’s early beginnings, as a theoretic physics student in 1920s Germany, to his Los Alamos testing site and, inevitably, to his shunning as a communist during the rage of the ‘50s Mccarthy witch-hunts. Politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a conniving individual who gladly threw Oppenheimer under the bus to further his career, sleazily instigated the scientist’s security clearance hearing in 1954. Downey Jr, looking gaunt, and older, is given chewy lines of dialogue, all shot in black and white sequences, and he’s impeccably cast as the villain of the piece.  There’s also Oppenheimer’s affair with an American communist named Jean Tatlock (scene stealing Florence Pugh) — it eventually ends, hampered by her unwillingness to commit. He later weds alcoholic Kitty Harrison (an underused Emily Blunt), whose role is underwritten. Pugh, nude practically the entire time, is a wonderfully haunting presence, a fragile figure with a tragic fate.  The number of characters in this film are aplenty, all played by notably well-known actors: There’s physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Matt Damon as the General overseeing the Los Alamos project, Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), a physicist who invented a particle accelerator, and Gary Oldman as President Truman. Benny Safdie even shows up as the thickly-accented Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist known as the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” and recent Oscar-winner Rami Malek, underused, is basically given just one scene. Here’s the thing about “Oppenheimer:” when it works, it soars. Some of the scenes conveyed here by Nolan and Lame, aided by composer Ludwig Göransson‘s sizzling score, feel transcendent. However, the point of “Oppenheimer” is for it to have a cumulative and powerful effect on the viewer once the 3-hour runtime ends. Can any other filmmaker in Hollywood work on this grand of a scale and get away with it? Maybe Martin Scorsese, but that’s about it. It helps that Nolan is aided by the talented cinematographer, Hoyte van Hoytema, who shot the movie in 65-millimeter film. Sometimes van Hoytema’s luscious photography overshadows the chaotic storytelling to the point where you’re sucked in by the images and lose track of the story. The film is filled with an innumerable amount of close-ups — in fact, most of the story is told via close-ups. If Nolan’s goal was to set the viewer inside Oppenheimer’s head, then mission accomplished. You can’t escape Murphy’s haunted blue eyes and it’s a towering performance from the Irish actor. There’s also a substantial number of scenes that feel damn-near visceral. Consider the one where Oppenheimer speaks to a crowd of patriotic Americans, post-Hiroshima bombing, their applause drowning out into mute. Panic sneaks into his head, the sound design starts roaring trembling sounds, the camera shakes, Oppenheimer continues talking, but it’s all reverberating echo. This is where he realizes the magnitude of what’s he’s done, and that he has the blood of innocent Japanese citizens in his hands. The trinity explosion has been spoken about plenty of times as well. Nolan didn’t use CGI, and the feeling you’re left with is like being there, at the first historic test of the bomb, as a literal light show occurs and a feeling of relief (and dread) seeps into the characters.  Nolan is absolutely obsessed with the subject at hand, maybe a little too obsessed in getting every detail of his story jammed into the film. And yet, it still feels as though “Oppenheimer” might be missing key moments that should have been added into its epic three hours.",POSITIVE
"Aug 3, 2023"," Oppenheimer marks the sixth collaboration between the singularly original writer-director Christopher Nolan and the Irish actor Cillian Murphy, who, given the leading role here, works diligently under the guise of the physicist who created the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer. Populated with lightning-fast dialogues, oppressive music and artificial tension, the film differs from Nolan’s previous moves as there’s no emphasis on action. In a way, the type of narrative adopted by Nolan curbs the inventiveness that made Memento, Inception and Dunkirk instant classics. As a cerebral biopic, it tries to get our attention through scientific fascination, political repression, international espionage, and the moral dilemma faced by the title character, who struggles with his own creation: a massive weapon that poses an existential threat to the humankind. Oppenheimer’s guilt is well expressed, as well as the cynicism of some of his associates, like Dr. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr. is excellent) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Even president Truman (Gary Oldman) disregarded his torment and did nothing to prevent his political persecution.  It’s an interesting, if formal, film that manages to captivate intermittently. Shot statically in black-and-white and color, it follows a transparent narrative strategy, being structured as a series of slow-moving scenes that require you to dive into meticulous dialogue with tenacity. On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun.",POSITIVE

"Aug 3, 2023"," As a young man with visions of a hidden universe, J Robert Oppenheimer lays in his Cambridge university dorm, beset by an inability to rest. He’s instantly portrayed as brilliant, yet carries with him a darkness. His mind may be unmatched, but his humanity screams louder than any theory he could present. At times he is cruel, other times cold and unfeeling, and then overwhelmingly ridden with guilt. The most important man who ever lived, creating a weapon without an equal.  ‘Oppenheimer’ takes such a complicated figure and fastens you in to his unique perspective. As you watch the development of the atomic bomb, you’re infinitely intrigued by its herald. Cillian Murphy’s performance of the legendary scientist is multifaceted, seeming vulnerable and exposed in one frame, yet operatic and enigmatic in the next. The invention itself has a devastating effect, but the film’s warning goes beyond the terror of dropped of the bomb. The sequence in which the bomb is first tested is nothing short of an audio-visual marvel, but the true danger of the film lies in the protagonist’s presence. As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat. His followers express their qualms, but with one impassioned speech he rallys the troops towards a terrible victory. Despite this statement on statesmen, ‘Oppenheimer’ is non committal in its portrayal of its subject. As much as it delves into the psyche of its titular character, it makes very little stride in a definitive conclusion on his character. ‘Oppenheimer’ will leave you with more information than you may have had about the father of the atomic bomb, but undoubtedly create several questions as well. The film leaves you to pass your judgement on the man himself, his actions, and his feelings towards them when all is said and done.  Note: While I appreciate you reading this review, movies are still incredibly subjective. If you think you might enjoy yourself, I encourage everyone to support the cinema industry as much as they can. Stay safe, and remember, life’s too short for bad movies.  The sound quality of this film is horrendous. The subject is weighty, and the film is fairly dramatic. Too bad it so lacks much context of the McCarthy era’s red scare.

"Aug 2, 2023","At three hours, Oppenheimer as a whole falls short of the sum of its pleasing parts.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023","  Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a massive pot roast of a movie, sliced into edible bits. Most of it is top-shelf craftsmanship, except for the back-and-forth structure. Certainly a sharper brain than mine could tell you why the film hops timelines, or goes from color to black and white. When Oliver Stone did this sort of thing in JFK, it was to convey as much information as concisely as possible (given the three-hour running time); there were so many moving parts, so many talking heads, that Stone’s illustrative, almost free-associative approach felt necessary. Here there are only talking heads and, from what we’re given here, a simple story: Once there was a very smart man who did a very bad thing, and ironically was raked over the coals for stuff he didn’t even do. Meanwhile, even more ironically, he gets medals and handshakes for the bad thing. The end.  There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years — as Admiral Lewis Strauss, the man who got J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) stripped of his security clearance on the grounds that Oppenheimer had Communist leanings. History views Strauss unkindly, but Downey makes him a smart man with understandable sore spots; he imbues Strauss with wit but not an ounce of the smug hipness that characterized, say, Tony Stark or some of his other roles. For me, the movie changed from Oppenheimer to Strauss whenever Downey showed up, his upper lip drawn down in umbrage. Downey and Nolan must have understood that a cardboard anti-commie villain wouldn’t do.  As for Cillian Murphy, I’d like to say that he shoulders this whole ungainly thing and holds it all together, but aside from an accent that sounds at times eerily like Robin Williams in serious mode, Murphy’s Oppenheimer seems purposely blank. It’s nothing that Murphy does or doesn’t do. It’s that this Oppenheimer has been hollowed out. We empathize with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean (Florence Pugh), who are always chastising him for one thing or another. Oppenheimer is reduced to visual iconography — the straight-brim fedora, the dark suits, the cigarette or pipe. Early on, we see Oppenheimer spike a contemptuous professor’s apple with cyanide (the plot is a failure). He mentions it later on, but if any linkage is intended to his complicity in developing the ultimate death-dealer, it’s certainly kept quiet. Murphy recedes into himself, enacting the self-abasing emotions of a martyr, and the movie slips from his fingers into the robust hands of Downey, or Blunt or Pugh or Matt Damon.  Anyway, Oppenheimer delivers the bomb. It becomes urgent to get the bomb before the Nazis do — an army that carries the bomb before it is invincible, as old Marcus Brody might say. “Does it work?” is an existential question, since one of the possible events if it doesn’t work properly is, oh nothing bad, just the annihilation of the planet. But it works, and thereafter Hiroshima and Nagasaki are knocked off the board. “Compartmentalize,” goes a refrain from Damon’s General Groves, and Oppenheimer has to keep his science and his morals in different boxes. As Tom Lehrer sang of Wernher von Braun’s ethos, “Once the rockets are up, who cares where they come down? That’s not my department.” That verse speaks more mordantly, and God knows more concisely, about the paradox of Oppenheimer than this whole solidly built but pompously designed edifice does. Does Oppenheimer care where they come down? (Does Nolan?) He says he does, but does he really care about anything other than physics, his passion for which is also given short shrift? Given the two icons in this summer’s Barbenheimer event, I know which one seems more plastic and less human.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 2, 2023"," So begins Oppenheimer, the tale of fission and fusion. The first sentence of the quotation above, which opens the film, is the story of Oppenheimer and fission, the act of dividing or splitting something into two or more parts. The second sentence, which will be represented by Lewis Strauss (pronounced “straws”) is about the fusion that would torture Oppenheimer, mostly after the bomb, the result of the process of joining two or more things together to form a single entity. Oppenheimer was a master of compartmentalization, splitting his life into many parts and managing to control them all. But with his decision to lead Los Alamos, the process he took on required the joining of many things together, most particularly Science and The Government.  I’ve seen the film 5 times now (in 4 formats) and I still don’t feel properly prepared to write about the work as it deserves… 10,000 words at minimum. Without the freedom to take deep notes - which I wasn’t going to do in full theaters - and really, the ability to work through the maze of the film with the ability to stop and process at times, it’s too much.  But I will do my best to offer some broad strokes. I don’t know if this really qualifies as a review, so much as a discussion of the work. I wouldn’t read further without having seen the film.  The color vs black & white thing has nothing at all to do with time. Oppenheimer’s perspective is in color. Strauss’ perspective is in black and white. I have confirmed that much in these 5 viewings. A few scenes cross over and are repeated from each perspective, most notably the scenes with Einstein. Oppenheimer is not in every color scene, but at least his imagination is the driving perspective in every one. Strauss was never in the various schools or Los Alamos, so there is no black & white in any of those segments, for instance.  Oppenheimer is Prometheus and Strauss is there to try to tie him to the rock for his perceived arrogance. But really, it is Oppenheimer’s own fears of what he has empowered that tortures him for the rest of his life.  It has struck me more and more, with each screening, how this film’s science vs government arguments are very reflective of what I would assume to be Nolan’s feelings about being a filmmaker and then having to hand his work to distributors to release it into the world as they see fit, more than he sees fit. Obviously, he has asserted all the power he has to control his films, demanding a long theatrical window, for instance, and to support the control that other filmmakers have of their films.  The camaraderie with which Oppenheimer and the other scientists work towards The Bomb, even with all kinds of in-house conflict, is, I imagine, how Nolan sees his work as an artist in the process of filmmaking, which can be dominated by one person (especially a writer/director/producer), but cannot be achieved by one person at anything like this kind of scale. You can lead, but you need a big village to follow and, at its best, add to your visions.  Obviously, a movie bomb doesn’t kill people like an atom bomb. But again, I would suggest that any artist, especially those who do have a large mainstream reach, considers the influence of their work on the world of filmic art… and sometimes, the world in whole.  But getting any movie made, much less a movie of massive scale, skill, and grace, requires some degree of myopia. Any multi-faceted discussion of Leni Riefenstahl may inspire fist fights, but it is unlikely that while making her films, she was thinking about how she was supporting the annihilation of millions of people. I am not saying that is a good excuse. But perspective matters. In Oppenheimer, one of the most controversial moments, even for people who like the film a lot, is a bit of purely symbolic nudity and sex between Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock in the midst of the private hearing/prosecution over his security clearance. Some see it as random and unneeded, but it shows us how vulnerable he feels when he is forced to discuss his sex life, initially just stripped himself, and then in the imagined sex act with the dead women with whom he had one of the few relationships that seems to have really mattered to him. It’s also a critical moment in defining his relationship with his wife, Kitty, as he is aware that Tatlock haunts her too, as much as she has tried to stiff-upper-lip it.  Some ask why Jean Tatlock is showing more skin than Oppenheimer in the interrogation scene. I don’t think that Nolan or anyone else was really measuring for effect. For me, it is one of the most beautiful images I’ve ever seen on loss and regret and knowing how someone you love is being hurt by your actions while you have no power to escape the moment. Tatlock’s sex is very purposeful, in all 3 of their sex scenes. She seems to be getting something Kitty doesn’t get… and likely, doesn’t want. And Jean has no interest in the surface things that are part of what drives Kitty. The two women, confronting each other in words and imagination, are Oppenheimer’s ying and yang. As long I am digressing to discussing the great moments of the film, another segment on Oppenheimer’s fear and regret comes in a Los Alamos celebration rally. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 1, 2023"," If nothing else, director/writer Christopher Nolan is a patient man. Whether it be his slow build of the psychological monolith that is “Batman Begins” or the controlled death spiral into the corners of the psyche in “Inception,” Nolan has never been in a rush. He has continued that approach with “Oppenheimer” which at times is the undisputed best picture released so far this year and at other times one of the most frustrating. This all comes from how Nolan begins to quietly unfold the story of one of the most monumental moments in human history and then eventually gets to the big explosive moment. “Oppenheimer” – based on the biography American Prometheus – examines the decision during World War II by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) to appoint physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to oversee the top-secret Manhattan Project. America is in a race with Germany to be the first to construct the first atomic bomb. Oppenheimer’s solution is to bring together the greatest scientific minds to a remote location in New Mexico to design the weapon. This led to the first nuclear explosion in 1945, an event that redefined the world. Nolan’s approach to the story was to build an arc of Oppenheimer’s life from his days as an eager student to his battles to save his reputation. This works because of a transformative performance by Murphy as the man who would become known as the father of the atomic bomb. Murphy and Nolan worked together on the “Batman” trilogy and that history shows in this film. Every moment Murphy is on screen is a controlled delivery of deep and dark emotions. He never has to adjust the volume of his performance as the historical significance is enough to elevate each click through the scientist’s life. His performance is in perfect step with Nolan’s directing style. Nolan’s methodical approach to the story becomes so dependent on the players that what should have been the biggest bombshell – the creation and use of the atomic bomb – is almost a footnote. It ends up just being the link between the first hour of the movie that establishes the characters and story points and the final hour where the emotional and political blasts finally reach the audience. The easy approach would have been to focus on the Nazis as the villains of the story. That specter always hangs over the film but Nolan’s determined approach leads to a more immediate threat from the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The full story of the bloody war between Strauss and Oppenheimer isn’t revealed until the third hour of the film. When Nolan finally decides to disclose that element, the movie takes on a tension as great as the race to build the super weapon. Unlike his work in “Dunkirk,” Nolan has not strayed too far away from the actual historical events. It was his blatant manipulation of the real story of the soldier evacuation during World War that ended up being a major flaw in that production. “Oppenheimer” so often plays like the readings of a transcript that even moments that had to be filled in come across with a realistic punch. A sticking point with “Oppenheimer” is the time element. Nolan always has looked at time as more of a blip than continuous thread from “Memento” to “Tenet.” That is acceptable with a fictional tale but there needs to be a more linear approach when it comes to history. As Nolan skips back and forth through Oppenheimer’s life, it becomes a test to keep track of whether the events are pre-bomb, during the creation of the bomb or the postmortem bomb world. A few time markers would have been handy. Nolan also continues to struggle with how to use women in his male-dominated tales. Emily Blunt turns in an impressive performance as Oppenheimer’s troubled wife but she is never used enough. And Florence Pugh’s role of Jeanne Tatlock – Oppenheimer’s on-again, off-again lover – comes across less as a way of showing the womanizing ways of the scientist and more of a nod to being gratuitous. Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity.

"Aug 1, 2023"," July 25, 2023 – To describe Julius Robert Oppenheimer, the father of atomic weapons, as a complicated man, is a gross understatement. In this film about the rise and fall of Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) writer-director Christopher Nolan (Interstellar) highlights the academic, professional, government project director, and personal life of Oppenheimer, and those connected with him. Nolan's (largely historically accurate) first-person screenplay is based on the biography, American Prometheus, by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. 
Oppenheimer's complicated life is made more complex in this film, because of the way it is structured. It begins with a flash-forward to a devastating postwar, month-long investigation into Oppenheimer's government security clearance. This is followed by frequent flashbacks, some decades earlier in Europe to his early academic studies. While his academic and political life was complex, his love life, particularly with Jean Tatlock (played by Florence Pugh of Black Widow) was equally so. Katherine Kitty Puening (Emily Blunt of A Quiet Place) became Oppenheimver's wife. Jean and Kitty were both members of the American Communist Party at one time, and this fact was a longstanding political problem for Oppenheimer. 
Anyone who has read No High Ground, (1968 by Fletcher Knebel & Charles W. Bailey II) watched Fat Man and Little Boy (1989) and watched The Day After Trinity (1981) will already know as much or more about the development of the atom bomb than what is shown in this movie, but not about the corrosive, long-running feud between Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (played by Robert Downey Jr.). 
Strauss, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, used his extensive government connections to help strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance. His hatred of Oppenheimer is seemingly based on a number of minor sleights suffered by Strauss at the hands of Oppenheimer, as well as major policy disagreements between them. While Oppenheimer thought little of it, Strauss held a grudge against him for years, and this ended up costing both men dearly. This feud plays a major role in this film. 
Nolan uses a number of visual clues in the film to signify different aspects of the story, including the use of black and white documentary-like scenes, contrasting with the the more subjective point-of-view color scenes in most of the film. In one striking fantasy scene during Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing, he, and his lover, Tatlock, are shown nude, having sex, while Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, seethes with anger over this part of his testimony. 
Stunning, imaginative images representing Oppenheimer's understanding of the quantum realm, punctuate Oppenheimer's studies of quantum mechanics, a field of subatomic theoretical physics not popular in America at the time, but which is now considered extremely important. Oppenheimer was one of the early university lecturers to give classes in quantum mechanics in the United States. 
Equally stunning are the performances from a huge and talented cast, led by Murphy, Downey, Blunt, Pugh and Matt Damon, who plays General Leslie Groves, head of the Manhattan Project. Also of note is Benny Safdie (“Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret”) who plays Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb. 
I was happy to see a couple of my favorite underrated actors in this film, along with a plethora of A-listers and Oscar-winners. They are Matthew Modine (Sicario: Day of the Soldado) who plays Vannevar Bush, head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development, and Josh Hartnett (Wrath of Man) who plays Manhattan Project physicist Ernest Lawrence. These two guys have given great performances in a couple of underrated films, Modine in the stunning sailing film, Wind (1992) and Hartnett in O (2001 adaptation of Shakespeare's Othello). 
Also good in the movie is another of my favorite actors, David Krumholtz, who plays a good friend of Oppenheimer, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi. Krumholtz has a significant role in this movie, his best since starring in a TV show called Numbers. He has some of the best lines in the movie, including, I dont want the culmination of three centuries of physics to be a weapon of mass destruction. 
It is easy enough to think of all this in the past, but the past never really stays in the past. It is with us right now. The nuclear arms race that Oppenheimer feared, happened, but treaties to limit the spread of nuclear weapons he championed also happened. Those treaties are breaking down now, and the threat of global atomic war has not gone away. 
Some scientists, including Teller, feared that the first atom bomb, detonated July, 16, 1945 in New Mexico would cause a chain reaction in the atmosphere which would destroy most of the life on earth. It did not, of course, but Oppenheimer tells Albert Einstein (played by Tom Conti) years later that he fears that the bomb nonetheless opened the door to a future global annihilation. 
If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago. 
While this film is visually stunning and it features great acting talent, its fractured structure makes it hard to follow because it just keeps jumping all over the world, in different time periods. That, and the film's long running time, three hours, makes it a bit of challenge to sit through. This film rates a B. 
There is a thin connection between Wyoming and Oppenheimer in this film. At one point in the film, Wyoming Senator Gale McGee (played by Harry Groener of A Cure For Wellness) is heard during a contested hearing on Lewis Strauss' appointment as Secretary of Commerce. McGee, who served from 1959 to 1977 is the last Democrat from Wyoming to serve in the U.S. Senate. It turns out that McGee played a key role in the Strauss confirmation battle, along with friends of Oppenheimer, particularly nuclear physicist David Hill (Rami Malek of Bohemian Rhapsody).

"Aug 1, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” is a White-Jewish male view of history and that POV provides an old-fashioned slightly East Coast-biased or Anglo-centric view of history despite attempts to make the film fill its diversity quota. The film is disappointing in its blazing whiteness that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in and, without the complications of racist reactions during a time of heightened hatred, the audience is misled to the historic conclusions. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Oppenheimer.”  The book was given the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography. I have not read the book so I can only comment on the film and what secondary sources report. Oppenheimer is portrayed as Jewish, but since he is portrayed by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, we should consider him as a white-passing Jew. We meet the 22-year-old J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1926 on a dark and rainy day. Before the title, a caption tells us: “Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.” This young man is tortured by homesickness. He’s far from home (Manhattan) and studying under Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy) at the Cavendish Laboratory in the University of Cambridge. Blackett, an experimental physicist, is reminded that Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) is giving a lecture. Oppenheimer has broken equipment in his lab experiment and Blackett forces him to miss the lecture since he must, at the very least, clean up for himself. Out of spite, Oppenheimer uses a hypodermic to poison an apple left on Blackett’s desk. Oppenheimer catches the very end of the lecture, but asks a question, a question that he has asked before. Bohr made foundational contributions to the understanding of atomic structure and quantum theory for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. He had founded the Niels Bohr institute (then known as the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen) in 1920.  The next day, regretting his decision to poison Blackett, he rushes to find that Bohr has the apple in his hand. Claiming there is a worm hole (the kind that involves a bug and not space), he quickly dispatches the apple to the trash and has a discussion with Bohr who asks “The important thing isn’t can you read music, it’s can you hear it. Can you hear the music, Robert?”  Oppenheimer is a lab disaster but he can hear the music of the universe and  transfers to the University of Göttingen, (officially the Georg August University of Göttingen). In 1942, Oppenheimer meets US Army General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) and becomes involved in what will be called the Manhattan Project: The race to develop the atomic bomb before the Nazis. The Nazis have Heisenberg heading their nuclear weapons program. The US has many immigrant scientists, some who have escaped the Nazis by fleeing to the US or the UK. While Groves questions Oppenheimer about his communist activities, Oppenheimer assures him that this won’t be a problem. Yet, we know that in the future it will be and the future is represented in another timeline filmed in black-and-white. Oppenheimer assembles a team that includes Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), Isidor Issac Rabi (David Drumholtz), Klaus Fuchs (Christopher Denham) and David L. Hill (Rami Malek)  at Los Alamos, New Mexico. He attempts to recruit Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), but fails. Los Alamos isn’t the only site, but the central location between UCB (Radiation Lab), Caltech (Project Camel), University of Chicago, Columbia University, Oak Ridge (Tennessee) and other locations. Oppenheimer has a love for New Mexico that predates the US entry into the war in 1941 so this is perhaps the real reason New Mexico was chosen over other desert states (e.g. Nevada, Arizona). The whole project is so hush-hush that all team members must compartmentalize their lives. Yet although married, Oppenheimer continues his affair with Tatlock although he eventually begins to distance himself from her. When he learns of her suicide in 1944 (4 January 1944), he is devastated. His affair will come back to haunt both his professional and personal life.   The race against Germany becomes a moot point when Germany surrenders in the spring of 1945. For reference (but not present in the film), Benito Mussolini is executed 25 April 1945; Adolf Hitler commits suicide 30 April 1945. Oppenheimer still believes the atom bomb will be necessary for the war with Japan. Pressed to complete and test the bomb before the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945 meeting of Joseph Stalin, Winston Churchill, Clement Attlee and President Harry S. Truman in Potsdam, Germany) , the bomb is tested (Trinity Test on 16 July 1945) despite poor weather.  In the post-war world, Oppenheimer is a hero, but after Oppenheimer embarrasses Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), also an American White-passing Jew, Strauss, as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, works to remove Oppenheimer from his position of political influence. Strauss also believe that Oppenheimer turned Einstein against him. Strauss will ultimately pay for his pettiness and Oppenheimer is given recognition much later.  I knew that I had two timelines that we were running in the film. One is in color, and that’s Oppenheimer’s subjective experience. That’s the bulk of the film. Then the other is a black and white timeline. It’s a more objective view of his story from a different character’s point of view. Scenes in black and white (Kodak created and FotoKem developed black-and-white photographic film for IMAX) show a different timeline. That alone merits re-watching the film.  You won’t be disappointed with the depiction of the detonation of the first atom bomb, but there will be other things that are disappointing despite obvious attempts to include diversity by showing African Americans in the backgrounds (as well as, according to IMDb on 31 July 2023, uncredited appearances of Ansa Woo as female student #70, Jack Wang as Cambridge student and Aamir Yusuf as Cambridge student) and including women as intelligent people.  SPOILER ALERT: The sex scene features Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer and Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock. Pugh stops during intercourse, gets up and goes over to the bookshelf, picks out a copy of the “Bhagavad Gita” and asks Murphy to read from it. Murphy reads the line “I am become Death, destroyer of worlds,” the quote from the “Bhagavad Gita” that Oppenheimer famously thought of when the first nuclear bomb was detonated – as intercourse resumes. While in a GQ interview Murphy says that the sex scenes were “vital” in this film because “the relationship that he has with Jean Tatlock is one of the most crucial emotional parts of the film,” the scenes are modest in their display of the male body. My husband thought this was to prevent an R-rating, but the film has an R-rating and comes 38 years after the nude scene in “A Room with a View” which featured Rupert Graves (as Freddy Honeychurch), Simon Callow (Reverend Beebe) and Julian Sands (George Emerson). That scene is non-sexual and makes the “Oppenheimer” scene where both Jean Tatlock and Oppenheimer are post-coital and having a discussion sitting across from each other with Murphy having his legs coyly crossed so that while the camera lovingly considers Pugh’s naked breasts, Murphy’s penis is well hidden by the carefully crossed and never uncrossed legs. (I’m thinking of Sharon Stone in the 1992 “Basic Instinct”).  If there needs to be nudity, why are we only given female genitals to admire? Could there have been a discussion of the Hindu scripture at a bookstore or over coffee? Yes, but it would likely not have had the same memorable impact for heterosexual men.  The nudity here only serves the heterosexual male gaze and thus, it would seem the nudity isn’t really vital because the display of male genitalia isn’t important to this film. If Oppenheimer’s genitalia don’t give us clues to his crucial emotional attachment to Tatlock, then the exposure of Tatlock’s breasts provide no clues either, particularly since we aren’t making a comparison between Tatlock and Oppenheimer’s wife.  According to an Art News article, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography of Oppenheimer, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the book on which Nolan’s film is based upon, notes that Oppenheimer was raised in a Manhattan family whose art collection included works of Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Rembrandt van Rijn, Édouard Vuillard and Vincent Van Gogh.  This exposure to art seems to be symbolized in the film by the appearance of painting that Art News identifies as Picasso’s “Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms.” The 1937 painting is currently at the Musée Picasso in Paris and is of Marie-Thérèse Walter, a woman whom “Picasso began seeing romantically when he was 45 and she was 17 in 1927.” The question then becomes why Picasso, particularly of a painting that was not in his family’s collection? Early on in the film, Oppenheimer, as played by Cillian Murphy, rises as a physicist in training. He meets the legendary scientist Niels Bohr, who devised a legendary model for atoms that is still used today, and is turned on to the magic of the discipline. “Can you hear the music?” Bohr asks Oppenheimer at one point, referring to the imagined sounds of invisible particles going about their business. Oppenheimer left Cambridge for the University of Göttinge. According to the Atomic Archive, Oppenheimer arrived at the German university in 1926 where he studied under Max Born.  Writing for ArtNews, Alex Greenberger suggests that the choice may be “Pablo-matic.” Picasso’s behavior toward women was bad as was Oppenheimer’s. Oppenheimer’s philandering is portrayed in the film. My husband thought the Picasso painting represented Oppenheimer’s interests in the Spanish Civil War which would eventually get him in trouble. The year of “Woman Sitting with Crossed Arms” is the year that his father died and his father’s death, according to Britannica, “left Oppenheimer a fortune that allowed him to subsidize anti-fascist organizations.” Brittanica also notes that “the tragic suffering inflicted by Joseph Stalin on Russian scientists led him to withdraw his associations with the Communist Party” though Brittanica quickly notes that he never joined the party.  The timeline Britannica presents is that in 1939, Oppenheimer began an affair with the married Katharine Puening–a botany grad student at UCLA whom he would marry in 1940.  Yet by introducing art, London-born British and American director Nolan has opened a Pandora’s box. How can this Oppenheimer, a man aware of art be totally ignorant of Japanese influence in California?  Japonism describes the influence of Japanese art, especially Ukiyo-e prints (literally, pictures of the floating [or everyday] world), on French artists in the second half of the 19th century. These prints were first exhibited in the Japan Pavilion at the 1867 Paris World’s Fair, but also later at the École des Beaux-Arts in 1890. The term Japonism was coined in 1872 by the French art critic Phillippe Burty to describe the influence of Japanese decorative objects as well as woodcuts on European art. Usually, the term is applied to the work of the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, who were specifically influenced by the flat blocks of color, the emphasis on design, and the simple, everyday subject matter. However, the woodcuts of Vallotton also demonstrate this influence with their flat shapes and asymmetrical design, as do many of the works of Bonnard and Vuillard, who painted scenes of everyday life taken from unusual points of view. Van Gogh considered Japanese prints a model of pure artistic expression, uncorrupted by Western modes of representation: “Japanese art is something like the primitives, like the Greeks, like our old Dutchmen, Rembrandt, Potter, Hals, Vermeer, Ostade, Ruisdael,” he wrote to Theo in July 1888. “It doesn’t end.” Rather than simply continuing to copy Japanese prints, though, Van Gogh began experimenting with aspects of them in his own paintings, including the use of bright, flat colours and strong diagonals, close-up and bird’s-eye views, unconventional cropping, the omission of the horizon, and the isolation of prominent objects, such as large cut-off tree trunks, in the foreground. Inspired by the natural world, he painted flowers, including, on several memorable occasions, irises – comparing one of these springtime views to “a Japanese dream”. The Japanese influence can be seen, and felt, in its simplicity and by incorporating themes from nature. Shibusa, or shibui in its adjectival form, is an important concept in Japanese aesthetics. While not easily translated, it has been described as a calm understatement, a quiet and sober refinement, severe exquisiteness and interesting beauty. Just as they sought to improve modern design by looking at previous styles such as the Gothic, Arts and Crafts practitioners embraced Japanese forms. They admired Japanese works because they, like medieval art, were thought to derive from a culture that was free from the depravities of modern industrialism. As designers grew more knowledgeable about Japanese art and culture they began emulating not merely the surface motifs they saw in the works, but their underlying design strategies. There are two California universities mentioned in “Oppenheimer”: the University of California, Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. It would seem disingenuous for the film to pretend that Oppenheimer and the rest of the scientists in California were unaware of the anti-East Asian racism present in Berkeley or Pasadena and the effects it had in these two institutes.  In the spring of 1942, all persons of Japanese ancestry in Berkeley had one week to pack and prepare for their forced trip to the Tanforan racetrack in San Bruno. They would be housed there for months in the horse stable stalls until they were transferred to remote areas. For Berkeley, that meant 1,300 residents. Those residents included UC Berkeley faculty (e.g. art professor Chuira Obata, who was at UCB 1932-1954) and staff as well as about 500 students.  At the UCB 1942 commencement, Sproul announced “That the senior class’s top student ‘cannot be here today because his country called him elsewhere.'” That student, Harvey Akio Itano, had three weeks earlier been sent with his family to an internment camp (Tule Lake). Itano, who received his BS in chemistry, had been chosen by the faculty as the University Medalist for 1942. He would become a professor of Pathology, ME, Ph.D. at UC San Diego.  At Caltech, there were also professors who worked to assist their students.  Professor Linus Pauling “fought particularly hard for two of his research assistants, Miyoshi Ikawa and Carol Ikeda. In both cases, Pauling’s intervention prevented these colleagues from being forcibly interned.” Pauling found Ikawa a place in the graduate program at the University of Wisconsin. Ikawa would return to do postdoctoral research at both Caltech and UC Berkeley before becoming a professor at the University of New Hampshire. Ikeda completed his Ph.D. at the University of Nebraska. He would later work at DuPont.  Pauling was briefly a friend of Oppenheimer, having met him in Europe (June 1927). When Oppenheimer accepted the position that split his time between Caltech and Berkeley, the friendship was renewed. However, when Oppenheimer invited Pauling’s wife, Ava Helen to travel with him to Mexico, and she reported this to Pauling, Pauling “immediately cut ties with Oppenheimer.”  According to “The Pauling Blog,” Oppenheimer did extend an invitation for Pauling “to lead the chemistry division” for the Manhattan Project. After Oppenheimer was given a loyalty hearing before the Atomic Energy Commission, Pauling wrote an article that was published in “The Nation”: “A Disgraceful Act” (1 May 1954).  Another researcher at Caltech, Robert A. Emerson, persuaded “government officials to permit rubber research to take place at the camps, and then he had to convince Japanese American scientists and nurserymen to join the project. Significantly, he enticed his former graduate student, Shimpe Nishimura to stay in the United States and eventually take over leadership of the Manzanar research.” People who worked on the project included chemist Kenzie Nozaki and Frank Hirosawa, Dr. Masuo Kodani, Homer Kimura, Shuichi Ogura and Frank Kageyama.  Kodani was from Pasadena (born in Los Angeles) and had been a student at UCB, graduated in 1938. His German Jewish emigre advisor, Richard Goldschmidt, had tried to find him a position on the East Coast, but was unsuccessful.  Ogura was born in Pasadena and was a visiting student at Caltech.  While Manzanar was in California, there were three internment camps in New Mexico:Lordsburg, Ft. Stanton and Santa Fe. Lordsburg, NM is about 400 miles or 5-6 hours away from Los Alamos. Ft. Stanton, NM is about 220 miles or four hours. Santa Fe to Los Alamos is about 1 hour or 34 miles.  Lordsburg (US Army-run internment camp) held Japanese internees from Hawaii, the continental US and Alaska from 1942-1943. The internees were moved, mostly to Santa Fe, so that prisoners of war from Italy and Germany could be held there. Ft. Stanton (INS) held mostly German seamen and German enemy aliens but was also a secret detention camp where 17 Japanese American dissidents were held for six months. The Santa Fe Internment Camp (INS) was located just 1.5 miles from downtown Santa Fe and eventually 4,555 male internees passed through.  The New York Magazine article, “Who Are the Japanese in Oppenheimer?”  Ryu Spaeth, a features editor at New York Intelligencer wondered where the Japanese were in Nolan’s film.  It is not Nolan’s job to faithfully depict the Japanese. He has made a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer after all. But some common understanding of this faraway foil is necessary for us to comprehend this historical figure’s significance. Nolan is most concerned with the fact that Oppenheimer brought us into the nuclear age, which gave humanity the ability for the first time to destroy itself. The legacy of the bomb, however, is more specific and concrete than Oppenheimer’s final vision of a world engulfed in nuclear fire. At the very same instant that the bomb created modern Japan in a burst of light, it also gave rise to the America we know today — America as superpower. Two new nations were born from this expression of the bomb’s divine power, and the cost of this transformation, like some ghastly blood sacrifice, were those 220,000 human beings who were either incinerated or succumbed to radiation poisoning, human beings Oppenheimer said were necessary to target to show what havoc the weapon could really wreak, which is to say that the inauguration of the American century would not have happened without the Japanese. But, of course, America does not see itself as sharing its history with anyone, let alone that it has a ghostly sibling on the other side of the world. Which is how Kai Bird, writing for the New York Times on the occasion of Oppenheimer’s release, can say with a straight face that the “real tragedy” of Oppenheimer’s life was that it discouraged scientists from standing up “in the political arena as public intellectuals.” Well, no — the tragedy is that his genius was literally weaponized against a country that may no longer have posed a threat to him or his country, against people who have been forgotten by their opponents, if they were ever known at all. Would it really be possible for Oppenheimer to have been oblivious to the anti-Asian sentiment in California and the internment of Japanese American teachers, faculty and students from Caltech or UCB?  Shamefully, anti-semitism emerged even there. When Oppenheimer recommended a top student, Bob Serber, to be hired, the appointment was blocked by department Chairman Raymond T. Birge, who wrote a colleague saying “one Jew in the department was enough.” Moreover, “Oppenheimer” represents the project as mostly a men’s club. Looking at the US Department of Energy’s interactive history of the Manhattan Project, it seems the project was a boys club. However, there were women involved and not just the one at Los Alamos who in the film notes she (Czech-American Lilli Hornig) was asked if she could type. Hornig, who is portrayed by Olivia Thirlby, was Jewish and had accompanied her husband, Donald Hornig (played by David Rysdahl) to Los Alamos. The film does include some debate on plutonium chemistry perhaps being too dangers for women (particularly in reference to reproduction).  But the world she graduated into, on the eve of the Pearl Harbor attacks, was rife with sexism and anti-Asian racism, and Wu found it hard to find a good academic position.  Because of World War II and the subsequent Communist takeover, she would never see her parents alive again. She is believe to be the only Chinese American working on the Manhattan Project.  It was reported that in 1940 you were listed as a sponsor of the Friends of the Chinese People, an organization which was characterized in 1944 by the House Committee on Un-American Activities as a Communist-front organization. The second Sino-Japanese war had already begun in 1937 (the first Sino-Japanese War was 1894-1895) with the 29 July 1937 Tongzhou mutiny, then the Nanjing Massacre that began on 13 December 1937. The Chinese themselves were not a unified front having conducted a communist purge in Jiangxi-Fujian (1931-1935) and the CCP purged  Koreans (Minsaengdan incident)  suspected of supporting the Japanese occupiers (1933-1936).  The wartime hysteria affected not only Japanese Americans, but also the Chinese and other East Asians. Remember, California had led or supported many anti-Asian legal initiatives from the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 to Alien Land Laws.  The wartime hysteria as well as the virulent anti-Asian sentiment in California is not mentioned at all in “Oppenheimer.” If one cannot intelligently discuss World War II in Europe without touching on anti-Semitism in Germany, Europe and the US, then one cannot possibly intelligently discuss the war against Japan without discussing racism toward Japanese and East Asians in the US, UK and Canada. Even when someone mentions Pearl Harbor, perhaps the average person in the US  forgets that the population of Hawaii in 1940 was predominately Japanese (139,631 compared to Caucasian at 112,087). The Chinese were 27,179 and the Filipino population was 63,052 (Koreans were 6,851 and Native Hawaiian were 64,310). Mainland USA had racist laws targeting East Asians, Filipinos and Native Hawaiians as well as Latinos and Native Americans during that time period.  Japan had been a US and UK ally in World War I so the question should be what soured that relationship. To understand the full impact and implications of dropping the atom bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, one has to discuss anti-East Asian racism in the US, UK and Canada. Post World War II, the Japanese (A crew of 23 men on the Daigo Fukuryū Maru 第五福龍丸were contaminated by the nuclear fallout on 1 March 1954) and Pacific Islanders were affected by 24 subsequent nuclear bomb detonations for testing between 1947-1958 at the Bikini Atoll.  To understand the impact of the Los Alamos on New Mexico, racism toward Latinos and Native Americans in the West (California, Arizona, New Mexico, etc.) needs to be discussed. In the film, Murphy’s Oppenheimer blithely assures there’ll be no problem acquiring Los Alamos, “There’s a boys’ school we’ll have to commandeer, and the local Indians come up here for burial rites.” This is barren land, except it wasn’t.  There were, in fact, dozens of families within 20 miles, largely poor families of ranchers and farmers, many Hispanic and Indigenous, who unwittingly went about their daily lives in the first fallout of the atomic age. Now, those who were infants and children downwind of the detonation of the “Gadget”—a code name for the plutonium bomb used in the Trinity test—are nearing the end of a decades-long battle to be recognized and compensated for generations of illness they trace to exposure from radioactive fallout. It should be noted that there was a Latino team member of the Manhattan Project: Luis Alvarez (portrayed by Alex Wolff). Wolff is not Latino, but his father was Jewish. Alvarez’s grandfather was a Spanish physician born in Spain who lived in Cuba before settling in the US.  Nolan’s source was written by two White men. Sherwin was born in Brooklyn, New York and died in Washington, DC (2021). He had served in the US Navy in Japan and received his Ph.D. in history at the UCLA in 1971. That’s just a year before David Carradine would begin his yellow face run as Eurasian Kwai Chang Caine in the TV series “Kung Fu.” Sherwin had also published “A World Destroyed: Hiroshima and Its Legacies” in 1975.  Sherwin’s co-author, Kai Bird, was named after a refugee from Communist China, and educated in India (high school), but his BA was from Carleton College (Northfield, Minnesota) and his MS was from Northwestern University (Evanston, Illinois). He has been a freelance journalist in Yemen, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.  The book  “American Prometheus” was also published almost two decades ago (18 years).  This was after the Japan-bashing of the 1980s and 1990s, but before the current rise in anti-Asian sentiment related to  the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, about 1,200 people marched in  Berkeley to protest anti-Asian hate. In Los Angeles, a solidarity march was held in Koreatown (27 March 2021)/ In New York (22 March 2021), there was a demonstration in Manhattan’s Chinatown.  The year 2021 was when Universal Pictures won the bidding war for Nolan’s  “Oppenheimer” script, but anti-Asian racism began to rise in 2020 with the international public health emergency measures.  Nolan’s scripting of “Oppenheimer” might have been better suited for the audiences of 2005. In the film, Japanese people are an abstraction and anti-East Asian prejudice in the West Coast and the US is as non-existent as the concerns of the people of New Mexico. There were people who were living in New Mexico before Oppenheimer inherited money from his father in 1937 and bought his Perro Caliente ranch and before Los Alamos was built in 1942.  In the film “Oppenheimer,” the desert is portrayed as a wasteland instead of a fragile ecological system and a place where many generations of people had lived and would be, as we know today, secretly suffering from Trinity’s radioactive fallout for decades. The possibility of cell damage and negative effects on reproductive cells is broached in the film, in the discussion about Hornig working with plutonium chemistry, but the downwinders are given no consideration in the film. And it isn’t the case that the scientists didn’t come into contact with the downwinders who, according to the Slate article, were recruited for construction or custodial work. In the 2014-2015 TV fictionalized TV series, “Manhattan,” a Chinese American scientist (Dr. Sidney Liao who is played by Eddie Shin) and day laborers and maids are included in the cast. It’s one thing to think of an enemy an ocean away as an abstraction, but another to callously decide the people working service jobs for the main characters as unworthy of safety considerations. In this age that calls for diversity, one has to ask: In 2023, do we really need a White male compartmentalized version of history, even if its idea of diversity is the inclusion of Jewish American main characters (Oppenheimer, Strauss and Einstein) and some consideration of White women?  “Oppenheimer” had its world premiere in Paris (11 July 2023) and then it’s British premiere in London (13 Justly 2023), followed by its US premiere on 17 July 2023. “Oppenheimer” was released theatrically in the US by Universal Pictures on 21 July 2023. ",NEUTRAL
"Aug 1, 2023"," J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist in charge of the project, and many others sweat it out in the New Mexico desert as they watch the test from what they hope is a safe distance. Oppenheimer has told the military head of the operation, Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, that chances of the explosion destroying the world are “near zero.” Groves’ response is that “zero” would be a much more comforting answer. Spoiler alert: The world was not destroyed. But, watching this unfold on the screen, waiting for the button to be pushed to set off the bomb, you can’t help but hold your breath and grip the armrests of your chair. That alone tells you something about “Oppenheimer” (R, 180 minutes, in theaters). Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash. In telling Oppenheimer’s story, writer-director Nolan (“Dunkirk,” “Inception”) tells a complex story about a complicated, brilliant man. Nolan doesn’t just focus on Oppenheimer’s involvement in the Manhattan Project, which led to the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending World War II. Among other things, it deals with Oppenheimer’s personal life, his Communist ties and the postwar political repercussions of his leftist leanings. In covering all of this, and jumping back and forth in time in the process, Nolan presents an expansive story that seems oddly misshapen, in which, for instance, the third act, post-bomb, is extended into a story in itself. In this case it doesn’t seem to matter much, though. (Another example where it doesn’t matter: “Lawrence of Arabia,” a magnificent epic whose first half is much stronger than the second.) “Oppenheimer” is a breathtaking achievement, and for many reasons: the exceptional performances; Hoyte Van Hoyutema’s majestic cinematography (see this film on the largest screen possible); Ludwig Goransson’s grinding, buzzing soundtrack, which amps up the suspense; the intelligence on display (given my limitations, I had to assume much of the scientific dialogue made sense); the still-relevant moral questions the film asks regarding weapons and war, and the responsibilities of science and innovation. Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with the same restraint that makes his gangster character in “Peaky Blinders” so compelling. You’re not encouraged to like Oppenheimer, or even necessarily understand him. He’s an intellectual snob, a cold fish with an unpredictable moral compass (he has no apparent qualms about sleeping with friends’ wives, for instance). Outwardly, he celebrates the success of the atomic bomb, but he’s also tortured by that success and tells President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, in one brief scene) that he feels he has blood on his hands (Harry doesn’t take this well). Wearing a wide-brimmed hat and suit, Cillian’s Oppenheimer looks like a scientific gunslinger – a brainy variation on a Clint Eastwood or Gary Cooper Western character – as he strolls through the Los Alamos desert community he creates for his scientific team. He is the stuff of legend. Members of the all-star supporting cast also are remarkable. Robert Downey Jr., in heavy makeup as a manipulative political figure out to destroy Oppenheimer’s reputation, and Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer’s bitter, alcoholic wife, deliver Oscar-caliber portrayals as characters different from any they’ve played before (at least, that I’m aware of). Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s Communist lover, and Matt Damon, as Groves, also are excellent. (Also in the cast: Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Conti – as Einstein, Casey Affleck, Jason Clarke, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Matthew Modine … it’s quite the ensemble.) Much has been made about “Oppenheimer” and Greta Gerwig’s “Barbie” opening on the same day. Maybe it’s because they both are potential blockbusters in direct competition. Maybe it’s because of the filmmakers involved, since Nolan and Gerwig are about as highly regarded as anyone these days. Maybe it’s because it’s hard to imagine two films being more different. “Barbie” (PG-13, 114 minutes, in theaters), co-written by director Gerwig (“Lady Bird,” “Little Women”) and Noah Baumbach (“The Squid and the Whale”), stars Margot Robbie as the living version of the famous Barbie doll, and Ryan Gosling as her (sort of) boyfriend, beach- and Barbie-obsessed Ken. Barbie and Ken live with other variations of Barbie and Ken in Barbieland, where almost everything is pink and, according to Barbie, “Every day is the best day ever.” That is, until Barbie starts thinking of death, and visits Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), and learns about cellulite and other real-life phenomena. Barbie and Ken wind up heading out to the real world, where they are exposed to other things like, oh, the patriarchy, and Barbie befriends a mother, Gloria (America Ferrera), and daughter, Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). It’s a clever idea to use Barbie and Ken to explore gender roles and relationships, personal identity and so forth. If asked to name a toy for girls on “Family Feud,” no doubt Barbie would be first on the list, but the Mattel doll certainly can be, and has been, accused of setting up destructively unrealistic expectations in terms of body type and conforming to dated perceptions of women. Through this story, Gerwig suggests that Barbie – and even lunkhead Ken – can change with the times. At the same time, the film expresses the exasperation of modern women – especially through an amazing speech delivered by Gloria about the impossible, contradictory demands placed on them. “Barbie” has a lot of good qualities besides this speech. Robbie and Gosling go for broke as their silly characters (who struggle to understand where romance leads, given they have no genitalia), and they pull it off. The art direction involved in the creation of Barbieland – along with the costume design, the hair and makeup, etc. – brilliantly engulf you in a colorful fantasy world. The problem is that a little amount of Barbie and Ken goes a long way, and the film eventually comes off as one-note. “Barbie” could have been a great “Saturday Night Live” skit, or even a series of “SNL” skits. But like some of those skits that have been turned into movies – “Coneheads” and the “Wayne’s World” movies come to mind – there’s not enough there to justify a feature-length film.

"Jul 31, 2023"," Why settle for only one review when you can have many points of view? “Oppenheimer” is a dense historical film that several of us at InTheirOwnLeague has definite opinions about so read on and see if you agree with any of us on this new opus by Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan has directed his best feature yet with “Oppenheimer.” Walking into this film without knowing much about Oppenheimer and his historical impact was a recipe that could have easily been disastrous. In fact, it did take me a little bit before I became invested in the film. The non-linear storytelling was a little confusing, but halfway through the first act, I was on board.  This is a fascinating character study of a troubled human being dealing with the moral dilemma of his creation. As a woman of science, the conversations about the atom and quantum physics were music to my ears. I was geeking out, but it left me contemplating the bioethics involved in this scenario. As scientists and explorers of the world, we have a natural tendency to discover and experiment, but where do we draw the line? And how should we deal with the political machinations that push and manipulate scientists?  Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate. The film left me admiring the brilliance of the human brain and heartbroken with the reality of our complete lack of sympathy towards other human beings. The ego is blinding, and seeking control and power oftentimes ends in atrocities and horrors.  With Christopher Nolan’s latest film, it sometimes feels like he is looking back to his breakthrough film, “Memento” (2000). Both films look at a person responsible for death being controlled by someone else- unlike Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is at the whims of a government thinking more about the world supremacy that comes with an atomic bomb than the morality of having one. Grey moral areas are Nolan’s specialty, and he brings all his narrative tools to the haunted life of Oppenheimer, and the politics surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb, its use, and the nuclear proliferation to follow. Great performances- from the intensely internal one from Cillian Murphy to the subtly bombastic Robert Downey Jr. and everyone in between- and technical craft- with breathtaking cinematography, sound, and a tense score- carry this narrative in every way in what might be the director’s finest film. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was punished for eternity for giving fire to man. “Oppenheimer” (2023) is essentially the story of Prometheus, but this one is frighteningly true. A biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, it’s a chilling character study in which a man, through scientific genius and just the right motivation, gave humanity the power to eradicate itself through atomic warfare. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Oppenheimer’s punishment was the overwhelming regret he felt once he realised what he had created. Writer-director Christopher Nolan could easily have turned this feature into one of excuses. But, through hypnotic editing and confrontational, yet empathetic, direction, he has made a staunchly anti-nuke film that decries the ways in which people desperately cling to modicums of supremacy. Despite its three-hour runtime the film flies by. The non-linear narrative introduces its conclusions so that we become drawn into how events unfolded, as one of science’s greatest minds becomes weighed down by his guilty conscience. This is a film in which innovative righteousness and patriotic celebration have their veils removed to reveal grotesque ambition and the screams of civilians dying at the hands of this grotesqueness. Through spellbinding visuals, a gripping script, and Cillian Murphy’s magnificent performance, this is not solely a remarkable character study. It’s a film that, through the filter of history, dazzles with its mastery of craft, directly challenging us on how the lust for power can, and perhaps will, one day destroy us all. A tour-de-force of storytelling and historical analysis, there is a strong case to be made for “Oppenheimer” being Nolan’s best film yet. Christopher Nolan, the most grandiose director currently working, took the metaphor of the man who built the atomic bomb and used it as an allegory for himself.  “Oppenheimer”’s plot is built around one of Oppenheimer’s critics, Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), and his behaviour towards Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) after the war. The twisting subplots of the building of the bomb, a security clearance-investigation Oppenheimer must endure, and Strauss’ senate confirmation which hinges on that investigation twirl around the black hole at the story’s center, which is the largely undepicted truth of what the bomb Oppenheimer built did. In an unusually stacked supporting cast Matt Damon, David Krumholtz, Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich stand out, but the women in Oppenheimer’s life, namely Emily Blunt as his wife and Florence Pugh as his Communist lover, have almost nothing to sink their teeth into. But anyone who’s seen Nolan’s previous work knows this is par for his course. Women are plot devices or ornaments, nothing more. It’s the men in suits who count. Men with the power to shape life by taking it away are the only ones who matter, and it’s their actions Nolan depicts, not their feelings. For a movie about the potential end of humanity the most heated chitter-chat is about unions in academia. Though Nolan lets Mr Murphy’s (exceptional) cheekbones do most of his expressing for him. And while Nolan is winning friends by speaking up for the workers in present-day Hollywood, the inescapable sense is that this entire exercise is just a salve for his enormous ego. I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone. The hallmarks of a Christopher Nolan film are all here in “Oppenheimer.” The lush cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the operatic and haunting score by Ludwig Göransson, the FX by Scott R. Fisher and company, all contribute to you knowing you’re watching a Nolan directed motion picture. The script is adapted from “American Prometheus” written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin which is more of a biography than an historical account of the Manhattan Project itself. This distinction is important in understanding the focus of the film on Oppenheimer himself and less on the story of the Manhattan Project, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the resulting Cold War.  That focus can be somewhat frustrating in its convenient glossing over of the terror that Oppenheimer’s work unleashed instead recounting his personal hell as a target of the McCarthy era. Robert Downey Jr. already has well deserved Oscar buzz swirling around his performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppie’s bugbear who stakes his career and reputation in destroying him publicly.  As astonishing as Cillian Murphy is as Oppenheimer, and he is incredible showing the emotional cost that eroded the man’s psyche and physical health, he is upstaged by the depiction of what he called the “gadget.” The Trinity test scene will leave you breathless but the true horror for me came afterwards in a scene that shows his scientists cheering for him and him congratulating them only for all to be reduced to ash in his mind’s eye. Truly nightmare fuel and you won’t leave the theater feeling safe and secure in your bed later on. That is the point of “Oppenheimer” and that is why this film is a must see.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2023"," This sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb is the most balanced film yet from director Christopher Nolan, who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle. The easy part for director Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth; a sprawling epic chronicling the creation of the atomic bomb. Trickier was embedding within that blockbuster megaproduction a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of perhaps the 20th century’s most unknowable man. Mission accomplished on both counts: Movies don’t get any bigger than Oppenheimer, and seldom do they get under a character’s skin more effectively. This is the most balanced film yet from Nolan (Inception, Interstellar), who has too often sacrificed character studies for spectacle. First, the spectacle: Nolan has chosen to make Oppenheimer on 70mm IMAX film, a decision that creates a granular universe that pops to life even on the digital transfers most theaters will be showing. (A ridiculously obvious bit of advice: Absolutely see Oppenheimer on the biggest screen you can.) In the tradition of the maxi-screen medium, Nolan and his perennial cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema offer breathtaking vistas of the New Mexico desert and picture postcard images of the lush university campuses the characters frequent. Filming almost entirely at or near the original locations, in New Mexico Nolan even recreated The Manhattan Project’s Los Alamos town — every board and nail of it — conjuring (for me, anyway) temporary nervous memories of Michael Cimino’s calamitous rebuild of 1880s Casper, Wyoming, for Heaven’s Gate. Then there’s the movie’s centerpiece: The detonation of the world’s first nuclear device — called “The Gadget” by its creators — early one July morning in 1945. Following an excruciatingly long countdown (I had no stopwatch, but I suspect those last few seconds are substantially drawn out), the explosion erupts with hypnotic grace. Nolan takes dramatic advantage of the fact that, depending on how far away you are, you’ll see an explosion long before you feel and hear it. As the fireball fills the screen (Nolan does the whole thing without a single digital effect), the soundtrack is silent, except for the breathing of Oppenheimer, who has left the safety of his bunker to stand, mouth agape, in the open air. One knock on Nolan has long been that he doesn’t know when to tell his composers to put down their pens; here, Ludwig Göransson’s soaring score falls silent, with unnerving results. As for the human element, never before has Nolan found such perfect balance for a film’s secret sauce. Cillian Murphy seems born to play Oppenheimer — compare him here with photos of the physicist and it is, frankly, hard to tell them apart. Murphy’s wide blue eyes seem to stare in perpetual horror at visions of what Oppenheimer’s creation hath wrought; his haunted, gaunt visage betrays the scientist’s own private, lifelong condition of shock and awe concerning matters of quantum physics. Murphy is the singularity around which the entire film orbits, but the who’s who supporting cast suggests that all of Hollywood was waiting by the phone, hoping Nolan would call. Matt Damon, pleasingly lumpy and charmingly officious, is Gen. Leslie Groves, the military officer in charge of the Manhattan Project. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh play the most prominent women in Oppenheimer’s life (although there were, reportedly, many more), and they make it almost believable that anyone would be willing to devote their lives to a guy with his head not merely in the clouds, but in the cosmos. Only one actor has ever won an Oscar for acting in a Christopher Nolan film (that was Heath Ledger as Joker in The Dark Knight, and let’s face it: Ledger was a director-proof creature). Certainly, Murphy has a Best Actor shot this time, but the shoo-in Supporting Actor nod has got to go to Robert Downey, Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the 1950s tycoon who was alternately Oppenheimer’s greatest promoter and worst enemy. Downey disappears into the role, eyes like saucers behind round, dark eyeglasses, vanishing hair brushed into a pitiful comb-over. Embodying the twin qualities of power and paranoia, Downey evokes a late-career Henry Fonda, with compelling results. Elsewhere, beneath masterful makeup, you’ll spot Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Gary Oldman as Harry Truman, and Kenneth Branagh as physicist Niels Bohr. One guy turns up, seemingly, just to pick up something that Oppenheimer has dropped, and I could’ve sworn it was Bohemian Rhapsody star Rami Malek. Sure enough, Malek returns an hour or so later to give one of the film’s pivotal speeches. Which brings up the one weak link in Oppenheimer’s cinematic chain reaction: its 3-hour length. (The studio released a photo of the celluloid IMAX version sitting on a projector noting that, unspooled, the physical film would stretch 11 miles, as if that were a good thing.) For such an assured piece of filmmaking, you’d think Nolan would have known when to end Oppenheimer. The climactic explosion comes roughly two hours into the film, then settles into chronicling the scientist’s turbulent McCarthy Era, during which he lost his security clearance — and access to government contracts — due to early contacts with American communists. Fair enough, but Nolan insists on subjecting Oppenheimer (and us) to one impassioned speech after another in front of a commission that we already know has been rigged (by Strauss) to toss him under the bus. It’s an important chapter, but compared to the world-changing events that came before, this one is worth, at most, 20 minutes or so. When the admittedly powerful finale finally came, I’m sorry to say I was glad Oppenheimer was over. And that’s no way to feel about a film that gets so much so monumentally right.",POSITIVE
"Jul 30, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” is utter perfection. It’s a timeless movie for the ages, with a lengthy running time that’s worth every scene for its history, character development, direction and a memorable score. Director/co-screenwriter Christopher Nolan’s genius – also obvious in the likes of “Dunkirk,” “Inception” and “The Dark Knight,” is evident in every frame of this biopic/history of the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy, well known for “Peaky Blinders,” may very well earn the Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of the physicist who changed the outcome of World War II and, indeed, global politics. The audience sees Oppenheimer as a brilliant student of the world around him – art, languages, politics and science all intrigue the young man. He understands, when German scientists split the atom in 1938, that this achievement could be used in weaponry. Oppenheimer’s politics and his connections to the American Communist Party are called into question by Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon,) leader of The Manhattan Project, the United States’ name for the development of the atomic bomb. The rest, as they say, really is history, with an all-star cast including Robert Downey Jr., Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh, and Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife and Florence Pugh as his mistress. I still can’t believe this film is three hours long. I didn’t feel it. I never felt the time drag and every sequence is engaging. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Jul 29, 2023"," This line from T.S. Eliot‘s triumph of modernist poetry, The Waste Land, encapsulates Christopher Nolan‘s granular approach to the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb,” who reads the poem in his university days, haunted by visions of atoms and stardust, too tortured to sleep. Oppenheimer, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin‘s biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, is an existentialist portrait of a man caught between his own petty humanity and his ability to peer into the very fabric of the universe and understand it. Over the course of three hours, Oppie (as his colleagues call him) finds himself both master of, and subject to, the principles of quantum physics, straining to reconcile the vast matrices of war and politics with his own almost obstinate naivete and blind loyalty to his own impulses. “Strong attractions,” as he tells his wife-to-be at a party when she asks him to explain his field of study. FissionAt its best, Oppenheimer is a character study that uses its protagonist to atomize the worldly implications of the distinction between theory and practice, between humanity and life as a human being, and Oppenheimer is the perfect vessel for the task. Embodied by Cillian Murphy, this complex figure is explored as more than just a part of history, but as a man, torn asunder by what Nolan rightly calls “impossible ethical dilemmas.” source: Universal PicturesOppenheimer‘s life is a mess of contradictions: As an adult, he went from the living rooms of the Leftist academic intelligentsia, to Los Alamos where he headed the top-secret Manhattan Project developing the A-bomb, and finally to a life of public activism against nuclear proliferation, a phenomenon he himself set into motion. This last also led to his systematic, underhanded discrediting by the United States–– a smear campaign that he did little to fight. Whether he likes it or not, as his Berkeley colleague, the eventual Nobel Prize Winner Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) frustratedly tells him, Oppenheimer isn’t “just self-important, [he’s] actually important.” The narrative of Oppenheimer‘s life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth. Yet Nolan‘s film fixates on the strange character of the man himself, presenting him as an impossible force and an immovable object, at odds with his own temperament. He can’t help but set himself up for failure at every turn: He is impulsive and egotistical, injecting cyanide into his professors’ apples (but snatching them away before they can be eaten), sleeping with other men’s wives (but always with flowers in hand), and ignoring his colleagues open warnings that his association with “known Communists” will pose a danger to his career (while actively refusing to join the Communist Party). He eagerly builds a weapon of mass destruction, yet crusades against new such devices soon thereafter. FusionNolan‘s directorial choices skillfully animate the deep psychological drama of his subject matter throughout. Murphy‘s performance is masterful, his weathered, skeletal face reflecting his character’s unpredictability with the grace of the clouds that cross the New Mexico sky. The arresting 65mm IMAX cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema captures this same duality, contrasting the washed-out tones of a midcentury photograph with the high-contrast monochrome of a Sidney Lumet or Otto Preminger film.source: Universal PicturesBoth modes feel lived-in, particularly the black and white, which manages to avoid the sensation of homage to an earlier period in (film) history, balancing classicism with freshness. Nolan’s script, though hampered by occasionally overwrought dialogue, is largely well-structured to weave past and present into a sinewed tapestry that evokes the occasionally jagged flow of memory, even as time moves inexorably forward without us. Like his protagonist, Nolan does occasionally lose himself in the more quotidian concerns of his personal project. His penchant for casting well-known actors sometimes proves distracting, most notably (for me) with the choice of former Drake and Josh star Josh Peck, whose virtually wordless performance is undeniably comic: he appears largely out of focus or half-glimpsed in the background. Other familiar faces fare better, Matt Damon brings warmth and bravado to his role as Lt.

Oppenheimer‘s life is a mess of contradictions: As an adult, he went from the living rooms of the Leftist academic intelligentsia, to Los Alamos where he headed the top-secret Manhattan Project developing the A-bomb, and finally to a life of public activism against nuclear proliferation, a phenomenon he himself set into motion. This last also led to his systematic, underhanded discrediting by the United States–– a smear campaign that he did little to fight. Whether he likes it or not, as his Berkeley colleague, the eventual Nobel Prize Winner Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) frustratedly tells him, Oppenheimer isn’t “just self-important, [he’s] actually important.” The narrative of Oppenheimer‘s life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth. Yet Nolan‘s film fixates on the strange character of the man himself, presenting him as an impossible force and an immovable object, at odds with his own temperament. He can’t help but set himself up for failure at every turn: He is impulsive and egotistical, injecting cyanide into his professors’ apples (but snatching them away before they can be eaten), sleeping with other men’s wives (but always with flowers in hand), and ignoring his colleagues open warnings that his association with “known Communists” will pose a danger to his career (while actively refusing to join the Communist Party). He eagerly builds a weapon of mass destruction, yet crusades against new such devices soon thereafter. FusionNolan‘s directorial choices skillfully animate the deep psychological drama of his subject matter throughout. Murphy‘s performance is masterful, his weathered, skeletal face reflecting his character’s unpredictability with the grace of the clouds that cross the New Mexico sky. The arresting 65mm IMAX cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema captures this same duality, contrasting the washed-out tones of a midcentury photograph with the high-contrast monochrome of a Sidney Lumet or Otto Preminger film.source: Universal PicturesBoth modes feel lived-in, particularly the black and white, which manages to avoid the sensation of homage to an earlier period in (film) history, balancing classicism with freshness. Nolan’s script, though hampered by occasionally overwrought dialogue, is largely well-structured to weave past and present into a sinewed tapestry that evokes the occasionally jagged flow of memory, even as time moves inexorably forward without us. Like his protagonist, Nolan does occasionally lose himself in the more quotidian concerns of his personal project. His penchant for casting well-known actors sometimes proves distracting, most notably (for me) with the choice of former Drake and Josh star Josh Peck, whose virtually wordless performance is undeniably comic: he appears largely out of focus or half-glimpsed in the background.

"Jul 29, 2023"," A biopic of masterful craft and heavy emotion, Oppenheimer is a high stakes story of war, politics, and the inner battle of a complicated  mind who changed the world with fire and fury. âNow I am become death. The destroyer of worldsâ. This line  from the Bhagavad-Gita - a 700-verse Hindu scripture - was famously quoted by  Robert J. Oppenheimer during an NBC documentary that aired in 1965. Oppenheimer,  known universally as the âfather of the atomic bombâ, is also the subject of  Christopher Nolanâs latest film and it is one of the revered directorâs best  yet.  Intellectually engaging, visually and sonically  stimulating, and packing an emotional wallop, Oppenheimer further  cements Nolanâs standing as the thinking mans blockbuster filmmaker, while  placing the spotlight on one of the 21st centuries most brilliant  minds and his most infamous achievement: the creation of the atomic bomb that decimated  the Japanese islands of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, thus ending World War II. Skipping back and forth between different time periods, as  well as black and white and colour photography, Nolan knocks the dust off the  stuffy biopic formula and delivers a movie that is pulsating with energy and  epic in scope. He also does so without losing the intimacy of retracing the  peaks and valleys in the life of a giant in the science community, a man whose  logic driven approach to his work is often upended by the unconventional and  even egotistical blunders made in his personal life. 

                                        Cillian Murphy delivers perhaps his best feature film  performance yet as Oppenheimer, portraying the eccentricities and fragilities  of this brilliant mind with an impressive restraint as the guilt that consumes  Oppenheimer slowing eats him up inside. Great too are the films numerous  supporting performances: Robert Downey Jr. delivers one of his best turns as Lewis  Strauss, the bitter and shrewd head of the Atomic Energy Commission; Matt Damon  brings his magnetic movie star charisma to the role of General Leslie Groves,  the director of the Manhattan Project; and Emily Blunt brings both fragility  and strength as Oppenheimerâs put upon wife Kitty.  When Oppenheimer focuses on the witch hunt against  the famed scientist who was accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union, the  film shifts from a story about the fight within the soul of a man to the fight  for the soul of a nation, as swampy figures within US government bureaucracy  and intelligence conspire to drag Oppenheimer down into the thick stench of accusation  and character assassination. While much has been made about the frightening nature of Oppenheimer regarding the danger of nuclear war (and rightfully so), perhaps the biggest  takeaway from the film is how, almost 80 years later, duplicitous figures  within the US government still utilise the same old tricks to usurp their  enemies.  The technical craft in Oppenheimer is fantastic. Shot  on IMAX film, the photography by Hoyte Van Hoytema (Dunkirk) is  rich and dense; the sound design by Richard King (Inception) and  his team is an immersive sonic journey; and the editing by Jennifer Lame (Hereditary)  is a masterclass in non-linear structure. It all culminates in the Trinity Test â one of the best  sequences in a Nolan film â in which Oppenheimer and his team of scientists in  Los Alamos, New Mexico, undertake the first test of an atomic bomb they have  spent four years and $2 billion creating. The recreation of this significant moment  in science is as awe-inspiring as it is frightening. It is also a reminder of  how mankind, unfortunately, continuous to use its God given intelligence and ingenuity  to create weapons of mass destruction while lost in the fog of war. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023","Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2023"," If you like film at all, you’ll no doubt be seeing Christopher Nolan’s epic three-hour biopic Oppenheimer. Considering the cinematic doldrums lately, why wouldn’t you go for this hugely hyped, wildly praised spectacle, which is bound to be given every known award? You’ll spend the hours studying legendary physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, in vast close-ups, especially if you see the film in IMAX, which makes Murphy’s face seem as tall as skyscrapers and his wide blue eyes as big as swimming pools. The attempt to understand “what made Oppenheimer tick” is as old as the A-bomb, and this film tackles it afresh, clearly with the assumption that it’ll all be news to the younger generation. If you’re already convinced of the dangers of nuclear war, superseded only by the ongoing end-times series of rolling climate catastrophes that now seem more likely to kill us all, this film is going to lack a certain urgency, however. Still, all of the Nolanisms beloved by his fans — who are legion after such career hits as The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk — are represented. Nolan’s traditional, emotionally melodramatic Hollywood movie tendencies are, as usual, dressed up in intricate flashbacks, narrative trickiness, pyrotechnic editing flourishes, and pounding soundtrack bombast. And because Nolan can now stack his casts with famous actors as yet another aspect of his sky-high production values, you’ll have the repeated experience of registering celebrity faces as characters are introduced. And so many characters get introduced, scenes sometimes play like handshaking parties. There’s Matt Damon as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, who brought on Oppenheimer as the head of the secret mission to win World War II by creating an atomic bomb! There’s Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission! There’s Tom Conti as Albert Einstein! There’s Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr! There’s Benny Safdie as “father of the hydrogen bomb” Edward Teller! There’s Josh Hartnett . . . and Rami Malek . . . and Casey Affleck. I’m hinting in my subtle way that I don’t particularly like Christopher Nolan films in general, so that’s something to note as you read this review. I also don’t like this film in particular. But, of course, there are innumerable rave reviews of Oppenheimer, so mine stands as a rare dissenting opinion. The film is constructed in a way that suggests trying to pull together the fissured strands of Oppenheimer’s personality even while acknowledging that there’s no way to arrive at a sensemaking whole when contemplating his visionary brilliance, his vacillating politics, his turbulent love life, his triumph and tragedy as the “modern Prometheus,” and his interludes of swaggering hubris combined with his interludes of guilt-ridden reticence. Ultimately, Oppenheimer is treated as an oceanic mystery of a man raised to the sky in public opinion for (in the view of the majority) saving the Allies from the ongoing horrors of fascism and World War II, then cruelly pilloried on trumped-up anti-commie charges. But the real punishment is his awesome guilt in leading the effort to unleash the horrors of nuclear war upon us. Nolan deploys a Citizen Kane–like model of narrative fracturing to convey Oppenheimer’s dizzying complexity in the crucible in which he found himself. Orson Welles’s original title for Citizen Kane was “American,” and he makes Kane’s material circumstances a vital issue in his film. Born into the hardscrabble working class, he becomes incredibly wealthy overnight through access to vast American natural resources — in his case, literally striking it rich with the “Colorado Lode” mining bonanza. This makes possible his ascent to fame and “great man” status while hollowing him out at the same time, catastrophically cutting him off from his own family and community. Like Welles, Nolan embraces the idea of the final unknowability of the character. Early in Nolan’s film, for example, you see the incredible incident of the deadly poisoned apple that the resentful student Oppenheimer gives his professor. This turns out to be based on something that really happened while Oppenheimer was studying at the University of Cambridge. Nolan represents Oppenheimer with aching sympathy as a lonely boy genius, homesick and further isolated from his peers by his obsessive visions of structures underlying the teeming chaos that seems to make up the world. He’s shown to be pitifully self-conscious of his own incompetence in the lab, which doesn’t exactly match the real Oppenheimer’s superior tone in describing his Cambridge education to a friend: “I am having a pretty bad time. The lab work is a terrible bore, and I am so bad at it that it is impossible to feel that I am learning anything. . . . The lectures are vile.” Nolan based his film on a Pulitzer Prize–winning biography that also regards Oppenheimer with tender pity, attributing his act of poisoning to his recurrent depression. “Robert did something so stupid that it seemed calculated to prove that his emotional distress was overwhelming him,” write the biographers Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin in American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. “Consumed by his feelings of inadequacy and intense jealousy, he ‘poisoned’ an apple with chemicals from the laboratory and left it on Blackett’s desk.” Oppenheimer injected an apple with some toxic substance that was perhaps not as lethal as the cyanide represented in the film, in which a remorseful Oppenheimer is portrayed as waking up in the morning, shocked at his own murderous act. He races back to the professor’s office to retrieve the apple from his desk. To his horror, one of his idols — Niels Bohr — is just about to take a bite out of the apple when Oppenheimer snatches it away, with the breathless explanation, “Wormhole!” That’s not actually what happened in real life. Accounts are a bit vague, but they agree that somehow Oppenheimer’s poisoned apple created no casualties but still got found out by the authorities at Cambridge. Oppenheimer’s father had to hurry to prevent young Oppie from being expelled, in part by guaranteeing his son’s regular visits to a psychiatrist. Not-so-young Oppenheimer went on to further acts of reckless hubris. According to a review of another recent Oppenheimer biography, “As a young professor in California, he crashed his car while racing a train, an accident that left his girlfriend unconscious. His father made amends by giving the young woman a painting and a Cézanne drawing.” Why not include Oppenheimer’s far more cinematic daredevil race against the train in this biopic? It’s every bit as telling of what comes later as the highly symbolic poisoned apple incident is. (Oppenheimer gave all of humanity a poisoned apple, but he failed to snatch it away again, see?) The “womanizing” Oppenheimer is shown to be an unintentional but nevertheless total disaster to the women in his life. Though, admittedly, he seems drawn to dark, depressive, humorless women who happen to be members or former members of the Communist Party. His longtime love, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) commits suicide when Oppenheimer ends their lengthy on-and-off affair. His long-suffering, alcoholic wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), is shown to be curdling into ever-angstier meanness during their marriage and repeatedly rejecting motherhood in the harshest way. But there’s no way to make the starker, weirder, more shockingly arrogant aspects of Oppenheimer’s personality conform to the portrait that Nolan’s building here. You’ll wait a long time for an American biopic to make a serious effort to tell the harsher truth. It’s a terrible genre for that reason. The more interesting, insightful aspects of famous lives are almost inevitably censored. Drawing on Cillian Murphy’s pitiful thinness — which he achieved through dramatic weight loss he could hardly afford — and the softer possibilities of his pink-mouthed, big-eyed face, Nolan presents us with a perpetually distracted, endearingly eccentric, brainy naif who gets carried away with his own visions and enthusiasms until it’s too late to reckon with the crushing consequences of what he’s done. There’s little sense, especially, of Oppenheimer’s well-known, towering ambition. It could certainly help account for some otherwise puzzling behaviors of his, such as his insistence on appearing before the kangaroo court assembled to remove his security clearance and tarnish his reputation in ways potentially fatal to his titanic career. This was well into the McCarthy era of blacklisting leftists for far less involvement in communist politics than Oppenheimer had, however scattershot his actual activities were. By 1954, the likely consequences were obvious. Einstein himself warned Oppenheimer against appearing, and then, when Oppenheimer refused to listen, dismissed him in a cutting remark to his assistant: “There goes a narr,” which is German for “fool.” Oppenheimer’s refusal to dodge the hearing is credited to his heartfelt patriotism, but surely his sense of self-importance and untouchability was a part of it too. As the film demonstrates, once on the receiving end of the commission’s attacks, Oppenheimer became soft and cagey in a way that infuriated his wife, who wanted him to put up a strong fight against the forces of American government behind the blacklist. Nolan represents this as a kind of “martyrdom of Saint Oppenheimer,” but a certain amount of crass careerism could’ve been portrayed as kicking in more overtly here, when his wife shrills, “Why won’t you fight?” After all, he had a lot to lose. As Nolan’s film demonstrates, postwar Oppenheimer was famous, considered the top scientist in America and maybe the world, celebrated on the cover of Time magazine. His conviction that he could help guide the government’s handling of nuclear weapons along more humanely concerned lines really did get him dismissed by Harry S. Truman as a “crybaby,” but the fact is, he was actually getting consulted by the president and every other important suit on down the line. Nolan’s is the kind of film that features an ahistorically dramatic line delivery and a pause for a shudder of horror from the audience when someone mentions the name of “Los Alamos,” the obscure desert location of Oppenheimer’s secret atomic bomb building and testing site. There’s exactly the same kind of ahistorical frisson in Gone With the Wind (1939), when Rhett Butler mentions the battle shaping up in a tiny Pennsylvania town that might decide the fate of the entire Civil War, called — weighty pause — “Gettysburg.” There’s also, more than once, the intoning of Oppenheimer’s own famously hammy quote from the Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita, in reaction to his work on the ultimate weapon of mass destruction: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” In real life, Oppenheimer’s detractors noted that his pretentious quotes drawn from extensive if eclectic reading were among his more maddening rhetorical traits, but there can be no humorous eye-rolling at such pronouncements in this film. Which makes me appreciate even more the wild and funny “Barbenheimer” mash-up memes making the rounds about the incongruous yet oddly Cold War–compatible same-day opening of Barbie and Oppenheimer. My favorite one shows an eerie, distorted black-and-white image of the face of real-life Oppenheimer with the caption, “Now I am become Barbie girl, in Barbie worlds.” But the anxious would-be profundity in the handling of the film’s subject matter is part of the typical Nolan strategy of informing the world, and the members of the Academy and other award-giving entities, of the importance of his chosen subject. Nolan is making the press rounds saying that J. Robert Oppenheimer is “the most important person who ever lived,” so it logically follows that his film is crucial viewing and that all of his seriously considered directorial choices are also terribly important. Critics take down the information about these choices like publicists and report them faithfully to a duly impressed public — such as Nolan’s surprising decision not to show the Japanese victims of the atomic bombings. Instead, we see Oppenheimer merely imagining the effects of the bomb on members of his rapturous American audience. But the absolute lack of physical reality given to the results of dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki — the refusal to portray mass annihilation — is one of the film’s more stunning glossing-over effects. It’s ludicrous, the idea that Oppenheimer’s imaginings, safe in the United States, of the flayed skin of a few people in his audience who are applauding his speech, and a charred body impeding his path as he takes his triumphal march away from the podium, is somehow “more effective and chilling.” Not showing in any memorable or realistic way the ghastly consequences of Oppenheimer’s biggest achievement is a safe-playing strategy, once again, to preserve audience sympathy for the hero, which you generally need if you want a big blockbuster hit. And Christopher Nolan always wants a big blockbuster hit.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 29, 2023"," At one point in Christopher Nolan’s three-hour anti-biopic, J.

How is that possible, he asks. At one point in Christopher Nolan’s three-hour anti-biopic, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), described as “the man who brought quantum physics to America,” is seen explaining to a student that light is both a particle and a wave. How is that possible, he asks. Nolan’s massive, ambitious, defiantly non-linear film is many things at once. Oppenheimer is both fascinating and frustrating, intimate and intriguingly aloof. It’s packed with (literally) explosive epic power that seems to be deliberately diluted with talky, time-hopping discursions. It relies on extreme close-ups of the human face, while holding its subjects at a cool emotional remove. Looking at the American scientist who worked on the Manhattan Project, heading the wartime program in the New Mexico desert to build an atomic bomb before the Nazis, the film compresses the sweep of history into the tragedy of one man. (Nolan acknowledges but cannot quite encompass the human cost of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.) Operating at Peak Nolan, the film features many of its auteur’s familiar tropes but uses them to sometimes unexpected effect. Nolan directs and scripts, adapting Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s award-winning book, American Prometheus. He invests that historical material with his own distinctive style, backing it with an almost unrelenting wall of sound (sometimes you can feel it vibrating in your chest) and mixing up short, prismatic scenes that slip through time. Nolan, the man behind mind-messing movies such as Inception and Tenet, has a reputation for being needlessly complicated. There are technical tics here that are possibly too opaque, like the often-muddy audio that makes for a lot of dropped dialogue. (You might want to watch it later with subtitles.) And the story structure can be idiosyncratic and anticlimactic, sometimes bafflingly so. In the end, though, Nolan’s weirdly withholding approach adds up to something better than a final and definitive picture of one man. Oppenheimer suggests the complex, elusive nature of public and personal truth. Embodying this ambiguity, Murphy inhabits the title role with a performance that is both precise and evasive. An actor who could be almost distractingly beautiful when he was young, Murphy is gaunt and angular here, marked and harrowed by his character’s inner contradictions. He gets Oppenheimer’s patrician arrogance, his nervy need for professional control that is at odds with his impulsive, messy personal life. He shows how the same man can grasp abstract scientific concepts and miss the implications of ordinary human interactions. (Genius is not necessarily the same as wisdom, as one character points out.) A large part of the success of Oppenheimer is due to the performance of Cillian Murphy as the deeply divided J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as his wife, Kitty. Specifically, he suggests how Oppenheimer’s eagerness to build an atomic bomb, which begins with ferocious intellectual curiosity and deeply felt opposition to fascism, is overtaken by crippling guilt at what he has made possible. Murphy’s extraordinary performance as Oppenheimer is the film’s central organizing principle, but there’s support from a battalion of actors — Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Josh Hartnett as scientific colleagues, military men and government figures, Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s communist lover, and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer (who at first seems like a bitter, alcoholic-wife cliché but under pressure gets a chance to assert her formidable personality). This is not a straight-up look at a turning point of wartime history. We don’t even get to Los Alamos until the one-hour mark, when Nolan uses his mastery of craft to ratchet up suspense around the Trinity test — the detonation of the prototype bomb. On the one hand, there’s a possibility the device won’t work. On the other hand, there’s a non-zero chance it could destroy the whole world. At this point, Nolan shifts from the global scale to a much smaller conflict that’s been hiding in plain sight. The last section of the film deals with congressional hearings and an Atomic Energy Commission board enquiry, in which McCarthy-era paranoia about communism fuels attacks on Oppenheimer, whose left-wing politics — he describes himself as “an FDR New Dealer” — are seen as potentially treasonous. In these sequences, Nolan elaborates on the story’s sneaky subordinate theme, the collision between experts and politicians — a tension that continues to play out in American life and gives this period piece some uncomfortable topicality. This ending may feel convoluted and anticlimactic, but Nolan seems to be making a deliberate choice. People may want certainties, but “the new physics,” as Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) suggests in one pivotal scene, can offer only probabilities. Studying at the University of Winnipeg and later Toronto’s York University, Alison Gillmor planned to become an art historian. She ended up catching the journalism bug when she started as visual arts reviewer at the Winnipeg Free Press in 1992. Nolan’s film… is one I couldn’t help but admire, even if, like the observers of the Trinity test, I could observe it only from a distance, at once awed and ambivalent. Christopher Nolan deserves every superlative for his take on J. Robert Oppenheimer (a flawless Cillian Murphy), the dark knight of the atomic age. This terrifying, transfixing epic emerges as a monumental achievement on the march into screen history. If Hollywood is ending as we know it — and all signs on that question point to a strong “maybe” — then Oppenheimer is the ideal movie to finish us all.

"Jul 29, 2023"," Vague Visages’ Oppenheimer review contains minor spoilers. Christopher Nolan’s 2023 movie on Peacock stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Check out the VV home page for more film reviews, along with cast/character summaries, streaming guides and complete soundtrack song listings. Trinity, the Manhattan Project and Los Alamos — for the greatest generation, these elements (alluding to the atomic bomb) led America to victory, bringing peace to a world gone wrong. Years later, these terms appear in textbooks, reflections of a bygone age. Some cinephiles associate these words with 1950s B films like Kiss Me Deadly (1955), hinting at a mutually assured destruction. But what of the man who opened Pandora’s box? What of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb? Even his German rival, Werner Heisenberg, has broader appeal, in no small part due to Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad (2008-2013). Still, the real Oppenheimer was one of the most complex individuals and scientific geniuses in history. Fortunately, in Nolan, fans can trust the filmmaker once again. Not only does Oppenheimer prove to be one the best-crafted biopics in recent memory, but it also boldly reaffirms the director’s auteur status. Nolan delivers an experience that is as much the caper as 2008’s The Dark Knight, as musically engrossing as Inception (2010) and an unabashedly mental mind screw ala Memento (2000).  In keeping with his cape crusader roots, Nolan recontextualizes plain old Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) into a tragically flawed idealist on a “mission,” a Batman for science. Much like Bruce Wayne’s nightmares of bats lead to him gaining the ability to bring order to chaos, Oppenheimer knows that if he can unravel his “visions,” then theoretical physics will reveal itself and save the day. Only then can the subject bring scientific order to his all too broken world. Oppenheimer’s conviction puts him on the same path towards enlightenment as his scientific idols and colleagues, Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) and Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighofer). Yet, when sensing Heisenberg’s intentions aren’t as “noble” as the rest, Murphy’s character sets out for the University of California, Berkeley, with the intention to apply his scientific expertise to bolster and defend America. Oppenheimer’s expertise in quantum mechanics lands on the radar of Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the lieutenant general in charge of the Manhattan Project. Groves is Oppenheimer’s Jim Gordon, a man who tolerates bending the rules for the greater good. As audiences discover, this superhero build-up soon transitions to the real meat of Nolan’s tale, which focuses on self-deception, unhealthy obsession, amoral womanizing, political infighting and ultimately a subcommittee hearing that puts Oppenheimer in confrontation with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Just as Gotham City turns on Batman, the American government torments Oppenheimer after his heroic feats. In the wake of COVID-19 and the financial woes of post-streaming Hollywood, Nolan might have been tempted to play it safe. To viewers’ great delight, this is not the case in Oppenheimer. Nolan stays true to form, creating an iconoclastic vision of the period; this is apparent in his build up of the relationships and complex emotions of core characters, such as the subject, his first love (Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock) and his wife (Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer). It’s through these three individuals that Nolan forms a morally questionable trinity, akin to the pages of pulp dime novels, presenting the bare-bones facts of Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 book American Prometheus. He expands this entanglement into the depths of man’s deeper and morally gray psyche. The vampish interactions of Tatlock and Oppenheimer feature dialogue reminiscent of a Howard Hawks screenplay. Pugh effectively provides come-hither posture, coupled with a slightly skittish sense of doubt that sells the whole “dammed if they do and damned if they don’t” nature of her questionable relationship with Oppie. Blunt, meanwhile, finds her identity as Kitty by playing up the shrew with the heart of gold, a solid counterbalance to Pugh’s l’enfant terrible harlot portrayal of Jean. Nolan steps out of his comfort zone by allowing Blunt to be the prime force that holds the Oppenheimer family together, downplaying Kitty’s alcohol addiction and not allowing her to fall into the trapping of yet another Nolan broom closet corpse.  It could easily be said that Oppenheimer’s story might have yielded an even more robust moral stance by making Kitty the focal point, but — as Nolan points out in interviews — the subject is one of the most influential and significant figures in American history. And Murphy’s consistent and engrossing performance seals the deal. In the context of American Prometheus, Oppie is a charismatic and intellectually curious leader. In every Oppenheimer scene in which Murphy’s character is being schooled by his peers, he presents himself as a humble Willy Wonka, soft spoken and enthusiastic in every conversation. And yet, at the same time, Oppie emerges as a contradiction and enigma. He is the great improviser in one scene, and then he’s a quivering scarecrow. Murphy even goes as far as to play up the lankiness of Oppenheimer by obscuring and exaggerating his posture.  As Groves, Damon performs satisfactorily. The same can be said of the rest of the cast, and it’s good to see Downey in a role in which he’s not a rich, extravagant playboy. The breadth of Rami Malek’s talent is barely tapped in the role of scientist David Hill, and Benny Safdie is a treat as scientist Edward Teller. But, Oppenheimer is a director-driven project, and Nolan runs a tight ship. Just as Oppenheimer was a great collaborator and brought out the best in people, the same can be said of Nolan’s directing style. The filmmaker has struck the perfect balance of being overseeing but too overbearing. The first indication is the sound mixing. Yes, fans, you can finally quit groveling; Nolan and his entire sound department heard your complaints and complied. Oppenheimer’s ADR mixers and production sound mixer, Willie D. Burton, should receive Oscars for pulling off the impossible.  Most importantly, Nolan’s collaboration with composer Ludwig Göransson yields a superb music soundtrack. In an interview with NME, Göransson describes working with Nolan to find the emotional core of the whole experience, mostly employing the complex, diverse range of the violin to match the vast range of Oppenheimer’s emotions. Music is the star of the show, accentuating numerous scenes throughout, including the diegetic mixing of the ball and chain during the Trinity test coupled with non-diegetic music mimicking the actual objects on display. The real Gesamtkunstwerk moment occurs soon after as the camera subtly sways back and forth and Göransson’s violins and piano arrangement intensifies, eerily reflecting Oppie’s and Groves’ trepidatious paranoia, until BOOM! The bomb goes off, and there is nothing but muted white noise and a hot red flash.  As Joseph L. Mankiewicz proclaims in David Fincher’s Mank (2020), “You cannot capture a man’s entire life in two hours. All you can hope is to leave the impression of one.” Within three hours, Nolan does his best to give audiences a glimpse into the complex mind of Oppenheimer. The man was without question an immense intellect, but his strength lied not in the ability to discover or blaze fresh new paths. It was rather his ability to understand, evaluate and assimilate the groundbreaking work of others and then extend it forward by integrating other groundbreaking theories. Oppenheimer had no difficulty in simultaneously holding two incongruous ideas in his mind at a time, objectively examining each and evaluating the strengths and weaknesses. This is a prerequisite for the quantum physicist who must accept that light is both a particle and a wave. Albert Einstein’s visionary intellect had literally opened the door of quantum mechanics, but he could not go through it because he could not accept the paradoxes to which it leads. Nolan portrays Oppenheimer as mastering this in several facets of his life. The subject empathizes with his Jewish heritage, but he learns Sanskrit, not Yiddish. Oppenheimer marries Kitty but continues an affair with Jean. He works to defend democracy but sees aspects of communism worth consideration. Following his birth in New York City — a steaming mass of humanity — Oppenheimer retreats to the desert of New Mexico like an Old Testament prophet. With near zero flaws, Nolan provides an epic tribute to one of the most influential men in world history.

"Jul 29, 2023"," “I played a guy named Tony in the MCU for about 12 years,” said Robert Downey Jr. earlier this month at the BAFTAS, where he was accepting the Best Supporting Actor award for his performance in Oppenheimer. “Recently, that dude Chris Nolan suggested I attempt an understated approach as a last-ditch effort to perhaps resurrect my dwindling credibility.” “That dude” is pure Downey, threading affection through satire like barbed wire: If there’s one filmmaker who doesn’t seem like a dude, it’s Nolan, he of the on-set suit-and-tie directorial style, the man frequently referred to by his own children as “Reynolds Woodcock.” (This clip of Nolan not quite losing himself while watching Eminem at the 2002 MTV Awards is the stuff of legend; it deserves its own oral history.) A-list razzing of this sort doesn’t get much better. But the larger sentiment about Nolan rescuing Downey from his own success couldn’t have been more on point—and is quite frankly meaner than anything Martin Scorsese has ever said about Marvel.  Back in 2019, the same year that Tony Stark met his fate at the end of Avengers: Endgame, Downey earned cinephile brownie points for being more conciliatory than most in response to Scorsese’s remarks—an indication that, unlike some of his collaborators, he understood the larger implications at play for cinema. In an interview with Howard Stern, the actor said he welcomed a “different perspective” and issued a slightly sardonic mea culpa about his franchise’s near-monopolistic box office dominance over the past two decades. “There’s a lot to be said for how these genre movies—and I was happy to be part of the ‘problem’ if there is one—denigrated the era, the art form, of cinema,” he said. “And, by the way, when you come in like a stomping beast and you eliminate the competition in such a demonstrative way, it’s phenomenal.” For an image of that dominance—and Downey’s central role in establishing it—think back to the astonishing scene in Iron Man when a revitalized (and now palladium-powered) Tony Stark lays waste to the terrorists who’d held him hostage, hovering over a war-torn village as an emblem of the American military-industrial complex, a wisecracking one, naturally, with benevolent intentions and perfect aim. In a moment when movies of all kinds were still channeling ambivalence in the wake of 9/11, trying to (super)heroize a guy who’s unilaterally carrying out drone strikes overseas was a tall order. But through a combination of actorly skill and the free-floating, endearing aura he’d cultivated in the aughts as a comeback kid, Downey didn’t just sell the concept: He made it impossible not to buy in. As national allegories go, the parable of a billionaire arms manufacturer who grows a (metaphorical) heart of gold hit the sweet spot between technocratic fantasy and political reality; by the time of the first Avengers movie, Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury was the official authority, but Downey was the top dog, coasting through his scenes on charisma and quietly acting circles around his younger costars—a dynamic that the better series entries mined for comedy and pathos. That Marvel has seen its critical and commercial fortunes diminish in the wake of Downey’s departure isn’t exactly a surprise. No matter who he was asked to bounce lines off of—from Mickey Rourke to Elon Musk—Downey elevated the games of those around him. Even in a knowingly slight entry like Spider-Man: Homecoming, he was a grounding presence and, humorously, a stand-in for the idea of a studio quality control filter. His above-it-all detachment while mentoring Tom Holland’s up-and-coming Peter Parker is especially funny when he talks about the need to cut costs—do they really need to introduce a cool new costume? How about the kid earns it first?  The joke gets funnier—or more obscene—when you consider that by the time of Endgame, Downey was reportedly raking in $75 million for his time on the movie. Hence the unspoken and borderline self-satirical subtext of the final Avengers outing: that Tony Stark’s death—born, inevitably, of noble self-sacrifice—was at least as ground-shaking as the resurrection of 2 billion civilian (and superhero) casualties. The film’s coda, set at Tony’s funeral, looks both prescient and grimly hilarious in retrospect, with every character in the MCU gathered to pay respects to their departed leader and meal ticket. “We are going to keep that moment and not touch that moment again,” Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige said last year. “We all worked very hard for many years to get to that, and we would never want to magically undo it in any way.” Certainly, Downey doesn’t seem in a rush to return to the armor-plated sweepstakes: He’s on the verge of winning his first Oscar for Oppenheimer. His role as the scheming D.C. operator Lewis Strauss is hardly his first award-worthy performance, of course. A quick trip through Downey’s filmography reveals a protean talent that initially thrived on the margins—in roles as junkies, hustlers, and hyper-verbal self-promoters—before his off-screen exploits began to overshadow his abilities. “It’s like I have a shotgun in my mouth, and I’ve got my finger on the trigger, and I like the taste of the gun metal,” he told a judge in 1999 while on trial for breaking the terms of an earlier parole; there, Downey’s decision to reunite and hire the legal team that got O.J. Simpson acquitted of murder charges felt uncomfortably like just another stunt.  In the mid-2000s, after going through prison, rehab, and several media cycles’ worth of condemnation and confession—as well as a comeback spot on Ally McBeal—Downey got white hot with a superlative run of inspired films. First up was a self-reflexive triumph as a mouthy, anxious actor in Shane Black’s post-Tarantino noir Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which accommodated Downey’s gift for synapse-fast quips (“I invented dice,” he tells a semi-impressed girl at a Hollywood party) while giving him room to develop an affectingly sleazy sense of chivalry. Then, despite famously feuding with David Fincher, Downey all but stole Zodiac as the flamboyant real-life investigative reporter Paul Avery, a character whose alcohol-induced downward spiral drew on aspects of Downey’s own life; holed up on a houseboat with only an Atari and some Aqua Velvas for company, he’s a spectacular wreck. Typically, a great Downey performance is an exercise in hairpin turns—a gauntlet of fast-twitch facial and verbal tics that makes it impossible to predict the direction of the next line read. In 1987, reviewing his breakthrough performance in The Pick-Up Artist opposite Molly Ringwald, Pauline Kael likened the actor to a prodigious puppy, writing perceptively that ”his soul is floppy-eared.” By contrast, Downey’s performance in Oppenheimer is a slow burn, and the actor—who hadn’t been in a feature in three years—seems to be repressing his usual dynamism. “Power,” says Strauss, “stays in the shadows,” and as shot by Hoyte van Hoytema in high-contrast black and white, Downey looks more sepulchral than ever. He’s like his own haunted portrait, rotting away on the inside. In lieu of the actor’s usual nervous, flitting mannerisms, he gives Strauss the stillness of a man who’s used to being the center of gravity in any given situation. His eyes, though, are alert—he’s the sort of guy who can hold your gaze while looking over his own shoulder.  There’s a certain gimmicky genius in casting the man who played Tony Stark as an atomic power broker, but the role isn’t a joke or a stunt. Instead, it’s a smoldering, slow-burn study of Machiavellian ethics being put into motion, a portrait of admiration mutating into contempt. As the film opens, Strauss—who served as the secretary of commerce under Dwight Eisenhower and was one of the architects of the Atomic Energy Commission—is depicted as one of J. Robert  Oppenheimer’s biggest fans, offering him a cushy posting at a Princeton think tank. Strauss’s glad-handing is strategic, though, and when he realizes it isn’t working, he reverses tack, using his position and influence to try to destroy Oppenheimer’s credibility and career as the Cold War goes into a deep freeze.  The Strauss-Oppenheimer rivalry figures into Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s biography, American Prometheus, and Nolan, who is a dramatist and not a documentarian, exploits it for maximum resonance. This includes inventing a whispered conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein that transforms Strauss from a gregarious (and not so subtly star-fucking) host into a third wheel who’s so vain he thinks they’re talking about him. It’s a dramatic conceit that works because Downey understands the depths of his character’s pettiness—the way that intellectual insecurity can eat at even a brilliant man’s sense of self until he sees enemies everywhere. Nolan loves duality in his scripts, and he and Downey make Strauss into Oppenheimer’s elegant but ugly fun house mirror image: a facile social climber who’s just conversant enough with real genius to know he doesn’t have it, and who’s willing to go scorched-earth in order to establish dominance.  The performance is impeccable, but the competition is stiff. This year’s Best Supporting Actor category is exceptionally strong, starting with Robert De Niro’s formidable disappearing act as a genocidal mastermind in Killers of the Flower Moon. Meanwhile, in another award season, the strategically over-the-top turns by Mark Ruffalo in Poor Things and Sterling K. Brown in American Fiction would have been the last word in cartoon stylization, but they’re up against Ryan Gosling’s Ken, who’s likely to endure as Barbie’s most inspired creation (and definitive proof that Gosling is better when he’s poking fun at po-faced alpha male brooding than trying to approximate it). It’d be a stretch, however, to suggest that Gosling, at 43, is “due,” whereas Downey is both richly deserving and in range of that “career achievement” statuette—an acknowledgment not only of his gifts but of his decision to apply them toward a different kind of blockbuster.  In what might be Downey’s best scene, Strauss asks his team whether the confirmation hearings he’d been treating as a formality have been swayed against him. He looks off-screen, away from his aides and toward a future when he’ll be remembered as a footnote in Oppenheimer’s narrative. “I’m denied,” he says curtly, with a stoicism that barely masks heartbreak. He’s right, and in the same moment, Downey is undeniable.

"Jul 29, 2023"," Even if Nolan’s movies aren’t your cup of tea, I think we can all agree that he’s capable of producing indelible images: astronauts leaving the familiar comforts of Earth for the seemingly endless void of the universe, soldiers packed like sardines on a dock waiting to return to a home they might never see again, the Joker sticking his head out of a police car window as Gotham City descends into chaos. Nolan’s narratives can sometimes be hard to follow—I understand 30 percent of the time-bending events that unfold in Tenet, at best—but his films always demand to be seen on the biggest possible screen. (IMAX screens, preferably.) No matter what, you’re in for a genuine spectacle; whether you’ll be emotionally invested in the characters is far less assured.  There’s a lot of TV out there. We want to help: Every week, we’ll tell you the best and most urgent shows to stream so you can stay on top of the ever-expanding heap of Peak TV. For a director with a proven track record of stunning image-making, Oppenheimer’s life and the creation of the atomic bomb offer fertile ground. (That Nolan set off real explosives for the movie was nothing if not extremely on brand.) But the paradoxical thrill of Oppenheimer is that Nolan crafts an epic tale that’s intimate in nature: a film with existential stakes that moves at the breakneck pace of a thriller despite mostly showing scientists, politicians, and military officials discussing the grave consequences of their actions. The actual detonation of nuclear weapons takes up a small fraction of the movie’s meaty three-hour running time, with the rest of the action unfolding like a chamber piece. For some viewers, that approach might feel antithetical to the Nolan blockbuster experience, but it’s that level of restraint that makes Oppenheimer the most ambitious project of Nolan’s career—daring to go small when everyone is expecting a grand display of showmanship.  To Nolan’s credit, he already has a more conventional World War II epic on his résumé. With 2017’s Dunkirk, Nolan immersed the audience in the evacuation of Allied troops from the land, sea, and sky—what the film lacks in memorable dialogue, it more than makes up for with a relentless sense of urgency. (The intense Hans Zimmer score also does a great job of elevating your heart rate.) In that respect, Oppenheimer makes for a fascinating companion piece to Dunkirk, focusing on the scientific minds back home that sought to create the world’s first atomic weapons before the Nazis could beat them to the punch. At their cores, Dunkirk and Oppenheimer are races against time during World War II—one of these events just happened to define the rest of modern history.  There is an undeniable potency to conveying the atrocities of war on the ground, but the real power of Oppenheimer is that it shows how the most fateful and calamitous decisions take place far away from the battlefield. (Watching Oppenheimer, particularly the scene where government officials brainstorm which Japanese city to bomb, I was reminded of the military higher-ups in Saving Private Ryan who ordered soldiers to risk their lives for what amounted to a cynical PR campaign.) It’s why Oppenheimer spends much of its running time leading up to the Trinity nuclear test before turning its focus to the harrowing aftermath—recreating the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki would’ve been a gratuitous perversion of spectacle. As the French filmmaker Francois Truffaut once said, all war films, to some degree, end up glorifying the very events they’re meant to admonish; Oppenheimer tries to get around that by avoiding the front lines entirely.  For the better part of the last two decades, Nolan has been handed massive budgets and delivered thrilling blockbusters that double as extraordinary technical achievements. (Your regular reminder that Nolan spent $5 million on a vintage Luftwaffe fighter plane in order to crash it in Dunkirk and followed that up by doing the same with a goddamn 747 jet in Tenet.) That certainly remains the case with Oppenheimer and the startling authenticity of its atomic bomb, which will rattle your bones in the theater, but that’s not the director’s most impressive feat in the movie. Rather, it’s that Nolan created such a grim character study at the largest possible scale and came out on the other side with what already feels like the defining film of the year. Taking an understated approach to the dawn of the nuclear age is the last thing I would’ve expected from Nolan based on everything he’s done since Batman Begins, and that’s what makes Oppenheimer so exciting as it relates to his evolution as a filmmaker.  During an Entertainment Weekly roundtable, Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey Jr. were asked to name their favorite Nolan film. (Nolan was also present and answered with Dunkirk.) There’s really no wrong choice, but Downey had an interesting perspective: The best of Nolan is yet to come. “Many people will say [Oppenheimer] is your greatest film and a culmination of aspects of every film you’ve ever done,” Downey told Nolan. “So it’s almost like Good Will Hunting: You’ve made this equation where you’re now at the end of the chalkboard, and what the heck would you do next? But we believe in you, sir. So my favorite film of yours is whatever the heck you do after this, because you’d better come up with something amazing.” As much as I love The Prestige, I’m inclined to agree.

"Jul 28, 2023"," Someday, in a secret lab deep under a desert mesa somewhere, leading scientific minds will study how the well-targeted release of two seemingly dissimilar Hollywood blockbusters exploded across the cultural zeitgeist into this monster called “Barbenheimer.” Movie studios counter-program serious prestige dramas opposite upbeat action or comedy often and with much success. But something about the one-weekend punch of writer-director Greta Gerwig’s heavily-marketed, candy-coated fantasy-comedy Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s epic yet introspective, all-star cast biopic Oppenheimer spawned the summer’s most unlikely double feature. The teams behind both films were smart enough to catch on to the public’s pitting the world’s most famous doll against the man who birthed the Bomb. And the team behind this dual review, having completed the double feature in Barbie–Oppenheimer order, can report that both films are smart enough to recognize, respectively, the stereotypical girlishness that Barbie represents, and the inarguably patriarchal society that J. Robert Oppenheimer both represented and at times resisted. Barbie, co-written by Ladybird and Little Women Oscar nominee Gerwig and her Oscar-nominated partner Noah Baumbach, actually turns examining the toy’s impact on generations of girls and women into its whole raison d’être. The movie’s lead Barbie, played pretty much to perfection by Margot Robbie, is the quintessential version of the doll, “Stereotypical” Barbie — blonde, blue-eyed, eternally effervescent. Yet, she lives in a stunningly realized, life-sized plastic Barbie Land filled with Barbies of all shapes, races, complexions, occupations, and even genders, though that last aspect is referenced only via casting Hari Nef, best known for her role on Transparent, also as Barbie. Issa Rae, delivering many of the film’s funniest lines, is chipper, inspirational President Barbie. Pop star Dua Lipa splashes up as Mermaid Barbie. All these women are Barbie, our Barbie explains. But who are we, really, and what happens when we die, Barbie wonders. In a hilarious record-skip in her happy-go-lucky life, Barbie starts pondering existential questions that even Kate McKinnon’s wise Weird Barbie can’t answer. So she sets off through a portal, that somehow exists, to the real world to try and figure it all out, with the help of harried, hard-working mom, Gloria (America Ferrera, acing the role), and her severely sulky teenage daughter Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt). Oh, and, of course, joining Barbie on her excursion is Ken, played by ever-ready Ryan Gosling as affably dumb, then cunning but still stupid as the male doll gets a mind to upset the power dynamics in his relationship with Barbie. Ken, and all the other Kens, as diverse a cohort as the Barbies, get lots of screen time, including a gleeful dance number. Simu Liu is a standout dancer and foil as Gosling Ken’s smirking nemesis, and One Night in Miami star Kingsley Ben-Adir definitely finds his Kenergy as a Gosling Ken friend. But the Kens are all basically comic relief in what is already a comedy about taking the patriarchy down a peg or two or three. Too bad for Ken he couldn’t rollerblade into the overwhelmingly male-dominated world of Nolan’s gravely riveting Oppenheimer. Employing the stark angles and features of star Cillian Murphy’s subtly expressive mien to great effect, Nolan gets into the head of the physicist, husband, father, womanizer, de facto politician, national hero, accused spy, and bomb-builder whose work changed the world forever. Less concerned with depicting combat and destruction than in probing the man and the visions of a sub-atomic universe that fascinated him, the drama’s narrative proceeds through a non-linear succession of meetings and experiments and congressional hearings. The film — shot alternately in crisp black-and-white and searing color by frequent Nolan collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema — is framed by two proceedings in particular: a heavily biased 1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing to review Oppenheimer’s national security clearance, and Senate confirmation hearings in 1959 to seat businessman and AEC chairman Lewis Strauss as President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Commerce. The outcome of the hearings, like the outcome of World War II, is a matter of history, but provides gripping suspense, as well as ample room for Robert Downey Jr. to blaze the screen with his portrayal of Strauss. Assuredly unfolding the nearly kaleidoscopic complexity of Oppenheimer’s former boss, Downey Jr. offers tempestuous contrast to Murphy’s cool, calculating Oppy, as the scientist is called by colleagues. Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, played in another fiery performance by Emily Blunt, calls him Robert and stands up for her man even when it seems his friends, his bosses, and his government have hung him out to dry in the kangaroo court where he’s forced to fight for his career, his reputation, and his legacy. The movie can’t solve its inherent problem that Oppy’s reputation amounts to very little against the tremendous losses and suffering of the Japanese in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So, Nolan simply doesn’t allow those losses onto the screen, except in a scene where Oppenheimer, an activist against the arms race his bomb inadvertently launches, watches with other scientists a slideshow depicting the horrific aftereffects of one of the bombs dropped on Japan. Murphy conveys the man’s guilt and ambivalence by the mere look in his eyes, or tone of his voice. Several scenes deliver thrills from such actorly skill, including a verbal standoff between Oppy and Matt Damon’s amusingly snide military officer Leslie Groves, who hires the scientist to run the top-secret Manhattan Project. Their project ultimately succeeds, resulting in an equally arresting bomb test that, through brilliant editing and sound design, is as breathtaking as the filmmakers intended. It’s hard to imagine, though, that Nolan and company might have intended for this sober examination of a misunderstood scientist to feature in a summertime box office showdown with the sly deconstruction of the bubblegum pink princess of American consumerism. Really, who would have thought? Not us, which is why we took the unusual step to brave the nearly five-hour Barbenheimer double feature and return with a candid conversation between Metro Weekly film critics André Hereford and Randy Shulman. ANDRÉ HEREFORD: I saw that you tweeted out your enthusiastic response to Oppenheimer. You mentioned that you believe Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr. would all win Oscars. You said win, which I want to clarify. Do you mean win or be nominated? Are you really going to go that far out on a limb for these folks in July without so many other movies having come out yet? RANDY SHULMAN: I mean, it’s Twitter. I’m sure I’ll change my mind. But yeah, I probably should have said nominated. Although, I do think that Downey Jr. is going to win. RANDY: Unless something else comes along that beats this performance, it is the most complex. And when you go read a little bit more about Strauss and his vindictiveness, Downey’s performance becomes far more complex. Also, I think that Downey deserves it after years of playing Iron Man — and doing a great job at that — but, I mean, he just sinks himself into Oppenheimer in a way that was astonishing. I think Blunt’s probably a long shot. But I think Murphy very well might win. Just the tone of what he created in terms of Robert Oppenheimer, personifying him. The Academy loves giving Oscars to people who play historical characters. And he plays Oppenheimer, from what I understand and from what I’ve researched, to a tee. If you look at pictures, he even physically transformed himself into the man. ANDRÉ: I put that not on just him, but Nolan. Because Nolan is detailed and a perfectionist. And I’m certain that not just dialogue but certain images were probably perfectly recreated from the real-life thing. I mean, I think Murphy is fantastic, and I’m certain he’ll be nominated. I don’t see how he could not be. I think Downey Jr. has one of those roles that… I think that for me a good example is Mahershala Ali in Green Book, where somebody is essentially a second lead. But you know they’re going to get nominated as supporting, and they are really what makes the movie go all the way up and over the hill toward its conclusion. There are rewards for that. This movie makes it to its end because of Downey Jr.’s performance. And yeah, the story happens because of that character, and he carries all of that really, really well. And Blunt — I think she has moments that’ll have people cheering. But in terms of a full-on performance, there’s plenty of room for other people to come along. I mean, Kitty Oppenheimer is brazenly unmaternal and sometimes unlikable. And that probably won’t win the character the goodwill that wins awards, but Blunt should win a lot of respect for how daringly she goes there. Because she is also a mother, so it’s got to be a complicated thing to play a woman who really hates being a mother. RANDY: I will add to that that Blunt has an incredible scene in the final act, and that’s what people are going to remember — that incredible scene in the hearing. Just incredible. RANDY: I would also posit that anything I write on Twitter to the 10 people that read me, including you, qualifies as personal hype. Also, I’m trying to counteract this swell of everyone on Film Twitter saying that Ryan Gosling is going to win an Oscar for Barbie. ANDRÉ: Because you bring up the word hype, we can say that it’s all been over-hyped, mostly from the Barbie end. But now from the critics’ end on Oppenheimer — the “This is cinema” reviews are already coming out, and they’re just really over the top for me. But it’s met by the same kind of reactions to Ryan Gosling as Ken. It’s hard to pull off playing a real-life toy, and he does a good job, and he’s okay. But I am certain that he’s not going to clutch an Oscar for this part. RANDY: I would be surprised if he got an Oscar nomination. I mean, it’s a good comedic role. But there’s really not that much to it. He’s a doll. He delivers the jokes really well. Besides, they rarely give nominations to comedic performances. ANDRÉ: Let’s talk about the jokes in Barbie. They do an amazing thing realizing what a Barbie Land would look like and how it would function, down to the plastic cups filled with nothing that everybody’s drinking. But the jokes, I think, were sort of hit-and-miss, and a lot of those hit-and-miss jokes are Ken’s jokes. In Barbie Land, Ken creates his Mojo Dojo Casa House. And we get a whole bunch of jokes about Mojo Dojo Casa House, which might’ve been funny one or two times. I think a lot of the Ken jokes get played out and aren’t super funny in the movie — like the Mojo Dojo Casa House. Ken not understanding that “casa” and “house” are the same thing is a little bit funny. But that’s sort of the level of humor that we’re getting. Whereas I think the filmmakers’ vision of how Barbie sees the world and how the world sees her, that’s where the sharpest humor is in the movie. People are loving, I guess, the goofiness of Ken. But for me, that’s not where the movie succeeds at all. ANDRÉ: I went in thinking Greta Gerwig, if anybody, was going to do this well. She seemed like as good a filmmaker to put on it as anybody else. And Margot Robbie seemed like, absolutely as she went around the world, posing as Barbie on every red carpet, seemed like the perfect person. So I left the movie feeling like they had been the appropriate choices, because it seemed like they figured it out. Gerwig and her co-screenwriter, Noah Baumbach, came up with a really smart way to conceive how, first of all, Barbies might imagine their impact in the real world if they were sentient beings. And then how they might actually interact with the real world if that collision occurred. Their reasoning for how that occurs is silly, but it’s a silly movie. The production design was amazing, and obviously colorful. It reminded me a great deal of the humor of Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar, which I think, because it was more of an adult-oriented movie, its silliness worked better for me. This movie is about uplifting girls and women, and exploring all sorts of things: diversity, gender, gender roles, consumer culture — so many different things really smartly. And it also had a great soundtrack full of music that you could bop your head to. Which is what you want in a summer blockbuster, for sure. RANDY: I’m always skeptical of a movie that has so much hype going into it, but Barbie surprised me. I liked it more than I thought I would. I laughed pretty much throughout it, which is rare for me. But the thing is that two days later, I can’t remember any of the jokes. Granted, that may be old age. Also, I don’t know what jokes are going to catch on. The Casa joke actually may be the one that becomes a catchphrase. And you know that Mattel — and they even allude to it in the movie — is going to build this Mojo Dojo Casa House, and people are going to go out and buy it in droves. I also really appreciated the production design, particularly at Barbie Land. The previews don’t really give away that everything is solid plastic. Even the pink sand of the beach is hard plastic, which I found very, very funny. I mean, they just live in this completely artificial, organically non-functional environment. A mirror, for instance, really isn’t a mirror, it’s just a round empty hole. I thought that aspect was very, very clever. And I thought Robbie was perfect as Barbie. She played it as you would imagine the doll to be. I also really appreciated, as you said, the diversity. I had some particular favorites. I loved Issa Rae’s President Barbie. I thought she was just delightful in that role. And she has some great showcase moments. RANDY: And she delivers them with an ebullience that’s just — she could have been the main Barbie. I mean, she just has this brightness. It’s almost glowing. I also loved some of the side characters. I loved Michael Cera’s Alan, this sort of failed Ken-friend doll. It was nice to see Cera clearly having fun with the role. The thing I thought was interesting was the way the movie addresses merchandising. The fact that Midge is there but dismissed — a pregnant Barbie did not go over well, so Mattel discontinued it, as well as depicting several of the other Barbies that were discontinued, like a Video Screen Barbie and a Sugar Daddy Ken. The end credits reinforce that, and I would encourage people to stay through at least the visual portion of the credits, because they illuminate the history of the doll pretty efficiently. ANDRÉ: For me, the end credits were a nice way to leave the movie after the disappointment of the actual conclusion of the film, which ventured so far into symposium territory that it didn’t even feel so much like a movie for a moment. That was to get across a message which is conveyed much more powerfully and dynamically earlier in the movie with a speech that America Ferrera gives, in sort of a funny plot twist, in order to wake up women in general. That speech is amazing. And America Ferrera is passionate in the role and delivers that speech with all the inspiration that’s intended, and none of the cheesiness that you get from the movie’s final minutes. RANDY: The ending of the film really didn’t work for me, either. Everything that came before it was funny or interesting or clever, and had just the right amount of social commentary woven into it — it was fairly smart. But I don’t think they knew how to end the film. Or maybe they tried different endings and settled on the best of the worst. RANDY: The ending just falls flat. The film sort of dies in the last five minutes. Now, that doesn’t negate my enjoyment of what came before, but it doesn’t help that Barbie doesn’t find a way to end. RANDY: I think a lot of people will disagree with us. Nothing is going to stop fans from loving every minute of this film, ending included, no matter what. But it will be interesting to see what the public does say. I’ll tell you something else that didn’t work for me. The whole Mattel boardroom shtick. It was interesting that the Barbies were aware of Mattel as their creator. And so they basically have a god, so to speak. But the interesting thing was how the Mattel executives were shown as sort of bumbling Keystone Cops. They weren’t evil overlords. They were just sort of silly. RANDY: They weren’t well-developed. They were just there for sort of this bumbling chase sequence, and nothing ever really came of the Mattel business, even once the executives got to Barbie Land, they were just men in suits completely out of place. It was just sort of like, “Let’s just sort of throw them in there and let them do some slapstick.” ANDRÉ: You needed some antagonists other than reality, I guess. But yeah, it was Benny Hill or Austin Powers. That’s one of those things — that kind of slapstick physical comedy — that, again, I think Barb and Star did better and in a really similar milieu. So that’s why I keep bringing it up. One thing that I won’t say I disliked about Barbie, but I was disappointed about: As we saw, Barbie Land was super diverse, and Barbie has a great line that all these women are Barbie. Barbie is all these women — and that includes a Barbie who is portrayed by a trans actress, Hari Nef. And Barbie is every job, every kind of woman, every shape and size and race and ethnicity, and they’re all presented in the movie, which is wonderful. We talk about their awareness. There is some awareness that they are dolls being played with by people in the real world. And what the movie sort of acknowledges, despite all this diversity and inclusion, is that apparently only little girls play with these dolls, whether it’s the girl dolls or the Ken and Alan dolls. And, as I know from personal experience, and as we can see in the Metro Weekly Forum which is part of this issue, that lots of boys had really complicated experiences around these dolls and other action figures. But because this doll was invented for girls, and this is a story about female empowerment, the movie really only tells a story from the point of view of how Barbie has impacted the girls who played with her. And I think that leaves out a really interesting slice of the story that, as you pointed out a couple of days ago, maybe will be in Barbie 2. And it’s not that they had to include it here, but I thought they might have, considering all the other ways they found to include everybody. RANDY: At some point, in any filmmaking endeavor, you have to find a point of view and focus. It’s worse when they try to spread it out. RANDY: No. I did not torment my sister’s dolls. I don’t think. Maybe. It’s possible that Chatty Cathy did not survive me. Now, on to that Oppenheimer segue. ANDRÉ: Perspective. One of the strongest things going for Oppenheimer is its sense of perspective. It jumps around chronologically — we’re seeing Cillian Murphy playing Oppenheimer at Cambridge as a really young man. We’ve seen him as an older man long after the bombs have dropped, and Oppenheimer is out there as an activist advocating for arms control. The movie bounces around, but the idea that we are in the shoes and in the head of Oppenheimer, as the movie’s poster suggests, is really strongly carried through the entire film. I think the movie loses something at the end, after the bombs have dropped. Christopher Nolan’s focus is so much on Oppenheimer and about how after that he had to fight to maintain his reputation, his legacy, and his career, that it obscures, omits, and completely dismisses the reality of any of the people who had bombs dropped on them. Even though that effect is considered, it’s never shown. No Japanese is spoken in the film. No Japanese characters even interact with Oppenheimer in his post-war days — and I would assume he did have some interaction with Japanese people who had some effect on his life and mentality. So it’s just weird to me that the people who had the bombs dropped on them have no voice in this film at all. But that’s again because of the strong perspective, which is otherwise beautifully rendered. RANDY: I don’t have as strong a feeling about that as you do. But I see your point — and it’s a powerful one. As I said to you the other day, I don’t think Oppenheimer was ultimately meant to be about the effects of the bomb on Hiroshima. It was about the effects of Robert Oppenheimer’s own internal realization of what he created, as well as his enthusiasm for what he was creating for the war effort. The movie does something remarkable. It’s hard to follow at first. We’re in this hearing, we’re in that hearing, we’re in this hearing — it’s all these little bits and pieces. And it congeals into a focal point getting to the Trinity test midway through. And then, in the third act, everything comes together in this really artful way, bringing a full sense of drama to everything that we saw in the first hour. It was very skillful filmmaking. It was very artfully achieved, and I admire the fact that Nolan pulled it off so beautifully. Because there are some big wow moments there, big dramatic pulls that really get you and just draw you in. It totally worked for me. ANDRÉ: I agree. The movie brings the chronology together and coalesces in a way that, even though you’re watching a Nolan movie where he tends to do this, he does it in a way that you didn’t see it happening and didn’t expect it. And you’re right that there is a sort of a wave of the realization — the eureka moment — of how he’s made all these bits and pieces come together to matter in the story that he’s telling in the final act. It’s especially well done, because most of those bits and pieces are, as you said, hearings, briefings, debriefings, they’re conversations. I think to an excessive degree, Downey Jr.’s character is saddled with narrating Oppenheimer’s biography in the early parts of the movie. But ultimately that gives weight to his character having such an important role in the story. But one thing I want to get back to — I guess clarify — is I think there are choices that Nolan made that could have still included Oppenheimer’s perspective on how the bomb was used and how any other bomb should be used that is affected by different experiences that we’re not going to see all entirely in this movie. And the choice to not include any of those moments that might’ve actually involved, as I said, people who the bombs fell on is a choice. I also think a choice that I was looking out for was Nolan to include, with just at least a few lines, the scientist J. Ernest Wilkins Jr., who we see working in the Fermi-led lab in Chicago, one of the research labs contributing to the project. I’m glad that Nolan included one of the dozen or so Black scientists who worked on the project and in different capacities, in addition to the hundreds of support workers and custodial staff. And I will say again that it’s not their story either, but it’s a choice whether or not you let us know that those people existed and had a part and belong in stories like this, in movies like this. It’s a choice. Thank God he at least included one, because it would’ve been a different kind of choice to have none. And that would’ve been the wrong choice. RANDY: Most people I know are going to Oppenheimer first and then Barbie. That will actually make Barbie, as you pointed out to me yesterday, more enjoyable for them. They’ll even find it funnier after the heaviness. I, on the other hand, actually found the gravity of Oppenheimer to be the perfect sort of — antidote isn’t really the right word, but it was the perfect follow-up to Barbie. Because I felt Barbie is a light, summer entertainment movie with some social commentary throughout. But with Oppenheimer, I felt like I was watching cinema. I was immersed in it, which is what Nolan intends. My attention didn’t flag, although I do think it’s a little long. I was engaged by it. I was confused by it at points — I think most of us don’t really know that much about Oppenheimer other than he is considered the father of the atomic bomb. And I’m one of those people, and so now it made me think, even during the movie, I need to go read American Prometheus, the biography it’s based on. I want to learn more. I actually look forward to seeing the movie a second time. That first hour or so will make more sense. It’ll work in a different way because you know where it’s headed. I think it’s actually designed for repeat viewings. RANDY: But I do think it’s just an artful work of cinema. It feels like an important movie — and I feel it is an important movie. I’ve read a number of essays that we’re in our own Oppenheimer moment right now with scientists and AI. And it’s good to be reminded of where the atom bomb and the hydrogen bomb came from, and what their purpose was, and how it forever changed our world. ANDRÉ: Except for those moments where they’re literally just feeding us people’s biographies, I think the movie did manage to convey Oppenheimer’s conscience through the acting and the script. I think Cillian Murphy is fantastic. His face is really sort of a special tool in filmmaking for him and for Christopher Nolan. And I think his internal journey was really vivid for me. I don’t know a lot about quantum physics or quantum mechanics. But something I related to definitely, being married to a scientist, is how the movie portrays the relationship between science and government. The way that basically the government was full court press to recruit the scientists into this effort. And then afterward, more or less, just sort of feeding them to the dogs or leaving them to whatever their fate would be. And seeing really from inside somebody who worked on “Operation Warp Speed,” it felt a lot like what I was seeing in the movie. That the government is like, “We need this right now!” And the way they not just enlist but pressure science to come up with the answers quickly. And then once an answer is found and it’s out there, off in the world and nobody can stop it, how the government doesn’t really stand up for these guys and women when the criticism comes after the fact. Fauci was sort of hung out to dry by himself after this country really, really needed him. And that’s exactly the story that Oppenheimer was telling. ANDRÉ: Yeah, I think it was Isidor Rabi’s line, and let’s mention that the actor who plays him, David Krumholtz, is fantastic in the movie. RANDY: I’d love to see Krumholtz get a supporting actor nomination. His warmth and compassion makes for a great contrast to Oppenheimer’s chill. I think we can agree that the entire cast is terrific. Even in the smallest of roles, nothing goes to waste here. ANDRÉ: Including one actor who has a single scene playing Harry Truman. And it was probably the most memorable scene in the movie for me. He was amazing. RANDY: It’s an amazing realization who the actor is. They don’t hide it, really, but he’s a great Truman. I do want to point out the sound and the visuals during the Trinity test scene, which was done without CGI. The sound especially during that moment was so shattering, my Apple Watch literally displayed a “loud environment alert.” Nolan has said that he wanted people to feel like they were in a nuclear blast. I think he achieved it. And I think that is as close as I want to get. We should also point out that it was screened for us in 70mm film, but not IMAX. Find a theater near you, I would say, playing it in at least 70mm if you can, and, if you’re lucky enough, 70mm IMAX. Film — rather than digital projection — gives it a depth that is both perceptible and imperceptible at the same time, if you know what I mean. ANDRÉ: I do. Also, since we’re making the comparisons, Oppenheimer is perceptibly different than what Barbie looks and feels like. I mean, obviously a great deal of care went into shooting and designing that movie, too. But in terms of how it’s assembled — the fundamentals of filmmaking and all of that — Oppenheimer just feels like a movie that, with or without the sound, you get a story. And adding every other element plus what you’re seeing on screen, it hits you even deeper than just getting the story. I didn’t really get that deep hit from Barbie. RANDY: My friend Norman pointed out to me that if you’re in the Washington, D.C. area, you can see it in IMAX 70mm film in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is about two hours away. So it’s probably worth the two-hour drive if you can get tickets to see it in King of Prussia. ANDRÉ: If I were going to take a two-hour drive to see something in IMAX right now, it would not be Oppenheimer or Barbie or even Theater Camp, which is also being reviewed this week, and I love. It would be Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning. That is something I want to see again as big and loud as possible. Because that is the true movie of the summer, in my opinion. ANDRÉ: Well, the phenomenon was off-putting, I’ll say. It was more than enough for me. And also, just as somebody who considers Margot Robbie a really talented actress, who did not get her due for Babylon, and who thinks that she seems like a really lovely person, she looked exhausted by the end of this press tour, because the Barbie stuff was pushed so hard. Apparently, every bit of press wanted a piece. So you can’t blame the marketing department for striking while the iron was hot. People are interested in this movie — I think intrigued, because they had no idea how they were going to do it. So they played into the hype in a way that they’re going to make a hundred million dollars their first weekend. They’ll say the hype was justified. Like I said, I found it off-putting. The Oppenheimer part of it was really not the off-putting part. That was much more low-key, but they’re both going to make more money and get more attention for it. And I like the movie business, so that’s a good thing. RANDY: Does calling it “Barbenheimer” diminish the historical and social impact of what Oppenheimer is trying to convey to us all? Does it turn it into a bit of a joke where it really doesn’t deserve to be a joke at all? ANDRÉ: Well, maybe that’s okay. Because that means people will be disarmed, no pun intended. They’ll go in — this is just the first half of their double feature — and they’ll come out of it thinking, as you pointed out and as the movie really clearly suggests, that what we’re living through in AI is a similar Pandora’s Box, cat-out-of-the-bag, what’s-going-to-happen-now, moment in time. I think it comes through in the movie. And maybe people can have that experience — and then go and laugh their asses off at Barbie. Modi Rosenfeld, better known as simply the mono-monikered Modi, does not consider himself political. Primarily, he's Jewish. Then gay. His role as a comedian is near the top. But political? Still, the Israel-born, Long Island-raised Modi knows his way around a political arena. His turn at roasting the famous in the service of Commentary magazine is testament. During the Donald Trump administration, the guest of honor was former senator Joe Lieberman. The best line, however, was aimed at one of Lieberman's senatorial siblings, in that period of Senate confirmation hearings for Trump's raft of Supreme Court nominations.

"Jul 28, 2023",The visuals and technical aspects of Oppenheimer were always going to inspire praise&#44; but it&apos;s Nolan&apos;s look at our frailty that sets this film in the upper echelon of an already famed filmography&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023"," Why settle for only one review when you can have many points of view? “Oppenheimer” is a dense historical film that several of us at InTheirOwnLeague has definite opinions about so read on and see if you agree with any of us on this new opus by Christopher Nolan. Christopher Nolan has directed his best feature yet with “Oppenheimer.” Walking into this film without knowing much about Oppenheimer and his historical impact was a recipe that could have easily been disastrous. In fact, it did take me a little bit before I became invested in the film. The non-linear storytelling was a little confusing, but halfway through the first act, I was on board.  This is a fascinating character study of a troubled human being dealing with the moral dilemma of his creation. As a woman of science, the conversations about the atom and quantum physics were music to my ears. I was geeking out, but it left me contemplating the bioethics involved in this scenario. As scientists and explorers of the world, we have a natural tendency to discover and experiment, but where do we draw the line? And how should we deal with the political machinations that push and manipulate scientists?  Nolan’s name comes with a level of prestige, and he doesn’t disappoint. The sound, score, cinematography, acting and overall execution are immaculate. The film left me admiring the brilliance of the human brain and heartbroken with the reality of our complete lack of sympathy towards other human beings. The ego is blinding, and seeking control and power oftentimes ends in atrocities and horrors.  With Christopher Nolan’s latest film, it sometimes feels like he is looking back to his breakthrough film, “Memento” (2000). Both films look at a person responsible for death being controlled by someone else- unlike Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is at the whims of a government thinking more about the world supremacy that comes with an atomic bomb than the morality of having one. Grey moral areas are Nolan’s specialty, and he brings all his narrative tools to the haunted life of Oppenheimer, and the politics surrounding the creation of the atomic bomb, its use, and the nuclear proliferation to follow. Great performances- from the intensely internal one from Cillian Murphy to the subtly bombastic Robert Downey Jr. and everyone in between- and technical craft- with breathtaking cinematography, sound, and a tense score- carry this narrative in every way in what might be the director’s finest film. In Greek mythology, Prometheus was punished for eternity for giving fire to man. “Oppenheimer” (2023) is essentially the story of Prometheus, but this one is frighteningly true. A biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, it’s a chilling character study in which a man, through scientific genius and just the right motivation, gave humanity the power to eradicate itself through atomic warfare. In the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, Oppenheimer’s punishment was the overwhelming regret he felt once he realised what he had created. Writer-director Christopher Nolan could easily have turned this feature into one of excuses. But, through hypnotic editing and confrontational, yet empathetic, direction, he has made a staunchly anti-nuke film that decries the ways in which people desperately cling to modicums of supremacy. Despite its three-hour runtime the film flies by. The non-linear narrative introduces its conclusions so that we become drawn into how events unfolded, as one of science’s greatest minds becomes weighed down by his guilty conscience. This is a film in which innovative righteousness and patriotic celebration have their veils removed to reveal grotesque ambition and the screams of civilians dying at the hands of this grotesqueness. Through spellbinding visuals, a gripping script, and Cillian Murphy’s magnificent performance, this is not solely a remarkable character study. It’s a film that, through the filter of history, dazzles with its mastery of craft, directly challenging us on how the lust for power can, and perhaps will, one day destroy us all. A tour-de-force of storytelling and historical analysis, there is a strong case to be made for “Oppenheimer” being Nolan’s best film yet. Christopher Nolan, the most grandiose director currently working, took the metaphor of the man who built the atomic bomb and used it as an allegory for himself.  “Oppenheimer”’s plot is built around one of Oppenheimer’s critics, Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), and his behaviour towards Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) after the war. The twisting subplots of the building of the bomb, a security clearance-investigation Oppenheimer must endure, and Strauss’ senate confirmation which hinges on that investigation twirl around the black hole at the story’s center, which is the largely undepicted truth of what the bomb Oppenheimer built did. In an unusually stacked supporting cast Matt Damon, David Krumholtz, Jason Clarke and Alden Ehrenreich stand out, but the women in Oppenheimer’s life, namely Emily Blunt as his wife and Florence Pugh as his Communist lover, have almost nothing to sink their teeth into. But anyone who’s seen Nolan’s previous work knows this is par for his course. Women are plot devices or ornaments, nothing more. It’s the men in suits who count. Men with the power to shape life by taking it away are the only ones who matter, and it’s their actions Nolan depicts, not their feelings. For a movie about the potential end of humanity the most heated chitter-chat is about unions in academia. Though Nolan lets Mr Murphy’s (exceptional) cheekbones do most of his expressing for him. And while Nolan is winning friends by speaking up for the workers in present-day Hollywood, the inescapable sense is that this entire exercise is just a salve for his enormous ego. I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone. The hallmarks of a Christopher Nolan film are all here in “Oppenheimer.” The lush cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, the operatic and haunting score by Ludwig Göransson, the FX by Scott R. Fisher and company, all contribute to you knowing you’re watching a Nolan directed motion picture. The script is adapted from “American Prometheus” written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin which is more of a biography than an historical account of the Manhattan Project itself. This distinction is important in understanding the focus of the film on Oppenheimer himself and less on the story of the Manhattan Project, the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the resulting Cold War.  That focus can be somewhat frustrating in its convenient glossing over of the terror that Oppenheimer’s work unleashed instead recounting his personal hell as a target of the McCarthy era. Robert Downey Jr. already has well deserved Oscar buzz swirling around his performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppie’s bugbear who stakes his career and reputation in destroying him publicly.  As astonishing as Cillian Murphy is as Oppenheimer, and he is incredible showing the emotional cost that eroded the man’s psyche and physical health, he is upstaged by the depiction of what he called the “gadget.” The Trinity test scene will leave you breathless but the true horror for me came afterwards in a scene that shows his scientists cheering for him and him congratulating them only for all to be reduced to ash in his mind’s eye. Truly nightmare fuel and you won’t leave the theater feeling safe and secure in your bed later on. That is the point of “Oppenheimer” and that is why this film is a must see.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023"," Apparently, the only thing Christopher Nolan fears more than a straightforward plot is a woman with agency. “Tenet,” “Dunkirk,” and “Interstellar” are all evidence that the much-praised writer/director is either unwilling to or incapable of telling anything but a nonlinear, dude-centric story packed with dumb tricks. Emphasis here on “dumb.” Because even though “Oppenheimer” is about smart people doing super science stuff, it is stupid. Laughably stupid. Repeatedly laughably very stupid. It has two of the worst sex scenes in history, the second somehow more hilarious than the first. It chops up an inherently compelling narrative into various threads that it then spaghettis into confusing, interweaving timelines with a billion characters and holds the mess up like a toddler making spaghetti art. Dumbest of all, Nolan becomes the first director to ever make Florence Pugh dull. Forget creating the atomic bomb, neutralizing Pugh may be the most dubious of all human achievements. Biopics are always a daunting proposition, with potential to villainize or sanitize actual human beings in the very real world. History is malleable, just ask Florida. The act of creating a narrative film about J. Robert Oppenheimer means intentionally shaping how he will come to be publicly remembered and perceived. Nolan may be a beloved filmmaker, but he’s not who we should want putting his thumb on the scale that weighs how the scientific face of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is remembered. The film follows its titular genius (Cillian Murphy) as he first gets educated in theoretical physics and then gets asked by Matt Damon to build a really, really big boom-boom. There are more steps involved, and pretty much every high-profile actor gets to pop up and say hi for a minute. So do two (2) well-known actresses. That’s right, “Barbie” can’t be the most feminist movie of the year when Nolan has two lady performers in his latest, right? They even make eye contact during one very uncomfortable, unintentionally hilarious scene. Knowing, as every adult does, that we live in a world with a nuclear arsenal, the “will they/won’t they” buildup to the bomb’s production is fairly inert. Articles leading up to the film’s release couldn’t stop describing how Nolan and his team simulated the giant explosion. What they did was, they exploded something smaller. And they filmed it. Wow, right? Anyway, with not even so much as a briefly spoken acknowledgement about the cancerous impact of the atomic testing and the disgraceful mistreatment of Native lands and populations, the whole arc of the bomb’s birth is a dud for various reasons. The other plot thread that evolves simultaneously, despite occurring later, has to do with Oppenheimer’s de facto prosecution by a government agency at the hands of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). This involves unpacking the salacious details of Oppy’s life, from his affair with a communist (Pugh) to issues with his alcoholic wife (Emily Blunt). The quasi-trial stuff is mostly great, with Downey Jr. dropping his career-best work. Maddeningly, it makes it so easy to imagine what a better movie may have looked like if Nolan wasn’t so invested in ensuring what should be his invisible creative hand was super-duper visible. If only the film been concentrated, in organized fashion, on the legal/congressional stuff, making Oppenheimer not simply defend his stunningly long list of small, personal indiscretions but that pesky bigger issue of whether it was “morally just” to outrace the Nazis to an extinction gadget. Nobody should want to see graphic depictions and “trauma porn” of the bomb’s effects on its Japanese victims. Everybody should want “Oppenheimer” to be something more than naked US propaganda. This is history as told by the “winners” only, and it feels gross. To be clear, this isn’t even saying that the ultimate conclusions about the bomb’s awful necessity or Oppenheimer’s flawed martyrdom that are reached here are wrong. This is only saying that the film is irresponsible in how it gets to that point, opting for a wormhole between its thorny question and simplistic answer. Goofy, nonlinear storytelling isn’t how a theorem is proofed. Here’s what’s hard: Nolan is a hell of a filmmaker. His talent is undeniable. You know what? So is M. Night Shyamalan. “Oppenheimer” is sensationally filmed. The performances are mostly great, provided the role is a dude. It is easy to see why so many people are praising what’s here. But it is stealth stupid. It is sneaky simplistic. It is camouflaged dumb. In “Tenet,” there’s a moment when the only woman who gets meaningful screen time is told that all of reality is going to explode, killing everyone that was or will be. She asks “including my son?” In “Oppenheimer,” after a montage in which a whole town for scientists and their families to live in is quickly built, Blunt’s character walks into her new home and says something like “There’s no kitchen.” It is meant to show a flaw in the men who built the town. It is so profoundly stupid as to expose the flaw in the film itself. The only women with notable screen time in the movie use it to ask about kitchens and babies or have sex. The only lady scientist, who barely appears, eventually has a shouted line of dialogue about how radiation will affect her womb. Nolan’s filmography exposes this as a rule, not an exception. This, combined with the fact that the whole movie feels somehow like a weird montage forgiving Oppenheimer results in that rare situation in which this very review will look intentionally contrarian or part of the inevitable backlash major works of art all get nowadays. This is just the opinion of someone who likes female characters to be written with all three attainable dimensions, who hates the “great man” theory of history, who questions the motives behind a historical biopic of this magnitude, and who very, very much greatly preferred “Barbie.” Tina Kakadelis at Beyond the Cinerama Dome says “It’s just baffling that in a movie that runs for 180 minutes there wasn’t time to allow these women to bee seen as substantial parts of his life. Nolan paints Kitty and Jean broadly and emptily. A cursory scroll through her Wikipedia will tell you that Jean was a writer and reporter for the ‘Western Worker,’ as well as a graduate of Stanford University Medical School. Kitty helped research cancer therapy and held a BA in botany.” Emmanuel “E-Man” Noisette at The Movie Blog says “I feel like Nolan does so many things technically right in his movies that it’s really hard for him to make a bad movie. With that said, I wouldn’t say ‘Oppenheimer’ is one of Nolan’s best films, but his worst films are still better than most.” Walter Chaw at Film Freak Central says “I wonder if it doesn’t seem better than it is because no real point of view is better than an entire boardroom of idiots with artless opinions. Anyway, ‘JFK’ is great. You should watch that.”",NEGATIVE
"Jul 28, 2023"," Inventive writer/director Christopher Nolan faced an awesome challenge: shaping Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman’s comprehensive, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography – “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” (2005) – into a cohesive, three-hour film. Admittedly complicated and confusing, its solemn concept melds science with drama, fusion with fission, and a multitude of characters with 20th century history, chronicled by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema in IMAX 70-millimeter. While the non-linear plot involves creating a top-secret coalition of scientists to build an atomic bomb, it also explores dense themes of coercion, Communism, and collective vision. At its center is soft-spoken theorist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where he often conversed with eminent Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) about quantum physics. During World War II, Oppenheimer was recruited by U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to spearhead the Manhattan Project which sequestered the best physicists in the United States in a sort of intellectual boot camp in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the weapon that would force Japan to surrender. His Nobel Prize-winning colleagues included Isidore Rabi (David Krumholtz), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Only weeks after its first test in July, 1945, ‘Trinity’ was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Digressing into Oppenheimer’s personal life, Nolan delves into his dysfunctional sexual relationship with psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a member of the American Communist Party, and his subsequent marriage to troubled Kathleen ‘Kitty’ (Emily Blunt), resilient mother of his children. Later on, Oppenheimer philosophically opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb and advised U.S. politicians to cooperate in an international agreement to put restrictions on the use of nuclear weapons. His ambivalence and audacity eventually placed him in direct conflict with duplicitous Adm. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, who stripped him of his security clearance during the politically paranoid McCarthy era. The supporting cast also includes Jason Clarke, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh and Gary Oldman. Expect Oscar nominations not only for Christopher Nolan but also for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who deliver the most indelible performances of their respective careers.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, a film biography of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) was heavily marketed in the weeks leading up to its opening in theaters July 21. Many audience members might be forgiven if they thought they would be attending another techno-special effects extravaganza from the director of three large-scale Batman movies. Whatever misunderstandings might have initially occurred, the ongoing box office success of Oppenheimer suggests that viewers are being drawn by something more than spectacle. The film is visually striking, shot with IMAX cameras for an immersive experience, but Oppenheimer is a serious and appropriately disturbing film about nuclear weapons and nuclear war. It is intended to leave viewers shaken, and it succeeds in that. The film’s genuine weaknesses are not so much the failings of the individual writer-director. They reveal more general problems bound up with understanding the Second World War and mid-20th century political realities. Nolan has undoubtedly tapped into powerful fears about the dangers and terrors of nuclear Armageddon, fears that perhaps have never been greater since the late 1950s and early 1960s, the era that generated films such as Hiroshima, Mon Amour (1959), On the Beach (1959), Dr. Strangelove (1964) and Fail Safe (1964). The Biden administration and its NATO allies continue to blithely insist they will not be “deterred” by the threat of nuclear conflict, and its possibility is openly discussed in US newspapers and television programs. That Oppenheimer has gained a wide audience speaks to a different sentiment in the general population, one deeply appalled by the possibility of the use of atomic bombs. One can criticize Nolan’s film from a number of points of view, but no objective observer could argue that it doesn’t encourage and deepen that mood. The commitment of an outstanding cast, including Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek and others, to what is clearly an anti-war project should be applauded. The opening sequence gives us a glimpse of the theoretical scientific paradoxes the young physicist Oppenheimer (Murphy) is wrestling with. Raindrops in a pond, spreading in ripples. Particles and waves. Flashes of light across the dark sky. A massive fireball erupting, punctuated by tiny glittering stars. Possibly the sun, possibly the atomic blasts to come. These images recur throughout the film, each time echoing a transition in Oppenheimer’s life. Nolan immediately places the revolutionary theories of Oppenheimer’s youth in their time, a period of innovative experimentation in art, literature and music, as well as science. While the film engages the audience in an engrossing story, it is never linear. There are essentially three interwoven threads: Oppenheimer’s life and career in the late 1930s and early 1940s, leading to his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico between 1943 and 1945; the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) hearing that strips Oppenheimer of his security clearance, ending his career with the US government; and the 1958 downfall of Lewis Strauss (Downey Jr.), Oppenheimer’s nemesis. Nolan’s film is based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. Bird and Sherwin are credited as co-writers of the film’s script. The narrative unfolds through the 1954 anti-communist witch-hunt conducted by the AEC, bending the story’s time frame through the strands of this vicious interrogation. The main thread is depicted from Oppenheimer’s point of view. In fact, Nolan wrote the screenplay in the first person, surprising most of the actors involved. In 1942, while a professor of the emerging field of quantum mechanics at the University of California at Berkeley, and someone with left-wing views and connections, Oppenheimer is recruited by Gen. Leslie Groves (Damon) to organize a top-secret military installation for the development of an atomic bomb, known as the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer is naively forthright about his and his colleagues’ links to left causes, his support for the Spanish Republicans in the 1930s and his close “fellow traveling” with the American Communist Party (close enough so that debates persist as to whether Oppenheimer was ever a party member—his brother and sister-in-law, wife and lover all certainly were). In any case, Groves insists that Oppenheimer is essential to the project and he is granted the necessary security clearance. Convinced that the Nazis are 18 months ahead of the US and Britain in the development of this weapon of mass destruction, Oppenheimer and Groves assemble an international team of top scientists and engineers to build what becomes a town of thousands in the “middle of nowhere” in New Mexico. It is here that Oppenheimer emerges as the “father of the atomic bomb.” One eminent physicist who declines to participate is Niels Bohr (Branagh). “You are the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves, and the world is not prepared,” says Bohr. Oppenheimer becomes a confident, highly respected leader and organizer of the project. Along with nearly all his colleagues, he is convinced the bomb will be used against Germany to end the war in Europe. However, with the Soviet advance against Berlin and Hitler’s suicide at the end of April 1945, Germany surrenders. Fully invested in the development of the bomb, Oppenheimer becomes an enthusiastic advocate for dropping it on Japan. In fact, he favors targeting a big city, for maximum casualties, in the vain hope that one bomb will end all wars forever. Under constant pressure to accelerate the development of the bomb, Oppenheimer and his associates select July 16, 1945 as the date for the first test, code-named Trinity, in part so that President Harry Truman can threaten Soviet leader Joseph Stalin with its power at the Potsdam conference scheduled to begin the following day. To a certain extent, the dramatization of the Trinity test becomes something of an unsatisfying substitute for depicting the actual bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and its consequences. It is, however, a chilling scene. The eerie score by young Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson, which propels the interlaced stories, leads to an extremely tense moment of utter silence as the flash from the massive detonation arrives before the sound. This becomes the stuff of nightmares. The authors of American Prometheus write, “They knew that after Trinity, the gadget had become a weapon, and weapons were controlled by the military.” Oppenheimer’s mood begins to change. A disturbing percussion thrums below the surface until it becomes the stomping of hundreds of feet in celebration at Los Alamos of the incineration of tens of thousands of people in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Oppenheimer ascends a podium where he gives a halting speech, “The world will remember this day…” his voice trailing off. He callously remarks that whatever success the bomb may have had, “I’m sure the Japanese didn’t like it.” The crowd cheers. Soon, however, the scene’s mood changes. In another artistic decision, Nolan has, to his credit, chosen to represent the horror of the bombing through Oppenheimer’s visions of the peeling skin, the charred bodies, the tens of thousands of dead in Japan. The celebration in Los Alamos becomes a writhing mass of weeping and vomiting men and women. According to Kai Bird, there is much truth to this depiction of the scene that night in New Mexico. Within a week of the bombing of Nagasaki, Oppenheimer delivers a letter to Secretary of War Henry Stimson expressing his wish to see nuclear weapons banned. In October 1945, a well-known encounter between Oppenheimer and Truman (Gary Oldman) takes place in the Oval Office. Seeking to convince the president that the arms race must be halted for good, Oppenheimer says, “I feel I have blood on my hands.” Truman tosses him out, declaring, “I don’t ever want to see that cry-baby scientist ever again.” Oppenheimer is now the most renowned and revered scientist in America. But the Cold War has already begun by the end of World War II, the wartime alliance with the USSR is over and so is the temporary amnesty for scientists and artists with former or enduring Stalinist sympathies. Oppenheimer’s political past and those of his associates and relations suddenly come under renewed scrutiny. He falls afoul of the most right-wing elements in the American ruling elite, those pushing for “rollback” against the Soviet Union and China, including the preemptive use of nuclear weapons. The vile Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), by now an advocate of developing the far more powerful hydrogen bomb (H-bomb), becomes one of his opponents. The scenes of the 1954 closed AEC hearing, which resulted in Oppenheimer’s security clearance being removed and his political disgrace in the eyes of American bourgeois public opinion, are unnerving in themselves. Nolan paints the government interrogators as authoritarian and unprincipled demagogues. The entire process undermines the official presentation of America in the 1950s as the “leader of the free world.” On the contrary, the American state is depicted as infested with quasi- or would-be fascists. The three government prosecutors grill Oppenheimer, his wife and colleagues, both friends and enemies, in a vicious McCarthyite witch-hunt, bullying, intimidating, tripping him up. We learn that the FBI has had a file on Oppenheimer since 1938, tapping his phone and his conversations, following him and his associates at meetings and social functions. When his lawyer (Macon Blair) requests access to the records, he is denied. The government figure directing this kangaroo court from behind the scenes is the reactionary Strauss, in his capacity as commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission. Nolan’s film is clearly hostile to the McCarthyite witch-hunts of scientists accused of disloyalty and spying for the Soviet Union, and by implication, of the similar witch-hunts of Hollywood directors, writers and actors, who also fell victim to the rabid anti-communism of the 1950s. Despite the efforts of J. Edgar Hoover of the FBI and Strauss of the AEC, Oppenheimer was never accused of spying for the Soviet Union. At the time, along with millions of others in the US, he viewed the Soviet Union as ally. The American Stalinists promoted the war and the US-Soviet alliance in the interests of Kremlin policy. Nolan is to be commended for treating many of the weighty historical issues contained in Robert Oppenheimer’s life with sincerity and urgency. Moreover, the scenes of left-wing intellectual life in the 1930s and 40s are treated honestly, in detail, without a hint of anti-communism. The unhappiness and death of Pugh’s Jean Tatlock is especially moving. The difficulties with the film arise in part from the director’s decision to tell much of his story through the eyes of his protagonist, so that the audience is encouraged to think and feel as the onscreen, fictional Oppenheimer does. Nolan’s decision to write his screenplay in the first person (from Oppenheimer’s point of view) reflects this. Aside from the 1958 events surrounding Strauss, presented in black-and-white, Oppenheimer is in virtually every scene. A tougher, more objective view of the scientist-politician is necessary. The working class cannot adopt Oppenheimer as one of its heroes. Although he held sincerely left-wing views in the late 1930s, Oppenheimer became a significant figure in the American military-intelligence apparatus. That the “left” in America by and large, including prominently the Communist Party, cheered on the incineration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that Oppenheimer could more or less seamlessly pass from pro-Roosevelt Popular Frontism to direct participation in the war machine, none of that excuses his role. By the early 1950s, while Oppenheimer, according to American Prometheus, “did not advocate the use of atomic weapons in Korea,” he did argue “that there was an ‘obvious need’ for small, tactical nuclear weapons that could be used on a battlefield. … Oppenheimer’s preference for tactical nuclear weapons as an antidote to genocidal warfare had unintended consequences. By ‘bringing the battle back to the battlefield,’ he was also making it more likely that nuclear weapons would actually be used.” Nolan’s generally approving attitude toward Oppenheimer’s role on the Manhattan Project, at least until after the Nazi surrender in May 1945, stems from a misconception about the Second World War: the pretense, as the WSWS has commented, “that a united and democratic America was at war against some unfathomable foreign evil.” While millions “went into combat motivated by the desire to defeat Hitler and fascism, World War II, in its social and economic essence, remained an imperialist war, a struggle between great power blocs for the division and re-division of the world.” American capitalism, with its great industrial strength and reserves, “could afford Roosevelt’s reformist experiments in the 1930s, but that did not make the war aims of the American ruling elite or its plans for the postwar world any less predatory or criminal.” This was demonstrated in part by the brutal, bloody manner through which the US and its allies prosecuted the war, in the horrific firebombing of Dresden, Germany and  of Tokyo and other Japanese cities in 1945, which led to hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths, as well of course as the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer’s emotional as well as intellectual response to his work on the Manhattan Project gnawed at him increasingly after the war, but he never apologized or expressed regret. The dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan was a war crime in which he fully participated. He did have blood on his hands. The historian Gabriel Jackson has aptly argued that “the use of the atom bomb showed that a psychologically very normal and democratically elected chief executive could use the weapon just as the Nazi dictator would have used it. In this way, the United States—for anyone concerned with moral distinctions in the different types of government—blurred the difference between fascism and democracy.” Only one political tendency denounced the war as an imperialist slaughter and struggle for global domination. The issue of the Militant, the publication of what was then the Trotskyist movement in the US, the Socialist Workers Party, following the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, carried the headline, “THERE IS NO PEACE! Only World Socialism can save Mankind from Atomic Destruction In Another Imperialist War! Workers of America! You Must Take Power Into Your Own Hands!” Long ago the revolutionary Marxists said that the alternative facing humanity was either socialism or a new barbarism, that capitalism threatens to go down in ruins and drag civilization with it. But in the light of what has been developed in this war and is projected for the future, I think we can say now that the alternative can be made even more precise: The alternative facing mankind is socialism or annihilation!... Christopher Nolan has said that scientists today working on artificial intelligence are currently having their “Oppenheimer moment.” But the planet’s entire population has been living for over 75 years under the shadow of Oppenheimer’s legacy. Nolan is keenly aware of this, and although he eschews didacticism, the conclusion of the film, which he terms “a cautionary tale,” is quite pointed in its message. The film returns to a recurring, enigmatic encounter between Albert Einstein and Oppenheimer at Princeton University after the war. As the conversation is ultimately revealed, Oppenheimer refers to his consulting Einstein about an early fear of his group of scientists, that a chain reaction, once ignited, might spread uncontrollably through the atmosphere. He tells the great scientist, an advocate of peace and socialism: “When I came to you with those calculations, we thought we might start a chain reaction that might destroy the entire world. … I believe we did.”",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2023"," Films about Great Men are usually acts of hagiography, and in many ways, Oppenheimer is no different. Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb”, is invested in Oppenheimer as a once-in-a-generation genius, a Great Man who literally moved the earth, but Nolan is also interested in all of Oppenheimer’s failures and foibles. And I do mean ALL of them, at a monster 180 minutes, Oppenheimer wades through the tides of Oppenheimer’s life if not at a leisurely pace, then certainly at a thorough one. We learn that “Oppy” is brilliant at theoretical physics but bad at math and a liability in the lab, he’s a womanizer, a bad dad and worse husband, and a big enough believer in his own importance to underestimate his own political liabilities. Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with a bright-eyed intensity and steely fortitude in turns, as he portrays the man from his student days in Europe to his post-war downfall. Nolan divides his film into three sections, one centered on a post-war hearing to renew, or not, Oppenheimer’s government security clearance; another focused on his days heading the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and the final section, told in black and white, from the perspective of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) during his own senate confirmation hearing to join Eisenhower’s cabinet.  Oppenheimer is a big film, not just in minutes but in scope of story and scale of ambition. It covers decades and monumental moments in history, but also makes room for more personal moments, such as Oppenheimer’s disastrous affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a gifted but troubled psychiatrist and Communist activist. Nolan, working from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s epic biography, American Prometheus, is interested in the contrast of Oppenheimer the Great Man and Oppenheimer the Lousy Asshole, though there is enough sympathy for Oppenheimer the Guy Who Changed His Mind Later that even Oppenheimer’s worst traits are a little rose-colored. Which parts of Oppenheimer appeal the most is entirely personal. I responded most to the later portion of the film focused on Lewis Strauss’s confirmation hearing. Oppenheimer isn’t even in this portion of the film, he only appears in black and white flashbacks as Strauss recalls their fraught history to a young senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich, absolutely stealing the show). Strauss personally recruited Oppenheimer to Princeton University, but after seeing Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) in conversation, and then being ignored by Einstein, he takes a strong dislike to Oppenheimer, believing the other man turned Einstein against him. Nolan, one of the most exacting filmmakers working today, recreates Los Alamos in painstaking detail (with production design by Ruth De Jong and set decoration by Claire Kaufman, Olivia Peebles, and Adam Willis), and re-stages the Trinity Test—minus the nuclear material—to its fullest effect. It is terrible, it is monstrous, it is awesome in the Biblical sense of the word—it is not more horrifying than even one single image of the real devastation visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The Manhattan Project portion of the film offers a lot of interesting stuff, from the recreated Trinity Test to Oppenheimer’s hideous home life—set to a soundtrack of screaming babies and his wife’s functional alcoholism—to Matt Damon’s reliably charming performance as the Army general tasked with keeping all these half-Commie scientists in line during the war. There is also a lot of time devoted to Oppenheimer sowing the seeds of his own destruction, as he dabbles in left-wing politics—mostly harmless before the war, but utterly devastating during the Red Scare that comes after. As smart as he is, Oppenheimer truly cannot read the room, whether it’s attending socialist rallies at the wrong moment or inadvertently betraying a friend as a possible spy.  But this portion of the film is also the most rote biopic stuff in Oppenheimer. It’s very well crafted and extremely well-acted, and it’s not exactly boring, it’s just that it doesn’t top a single line delivered during the “senate hearing” portion of the film. Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing at least has a truly great scene with Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife, a talented scientist in her own right relegated to the kitchen by The Times. That scene crackles with Kitty’s repressed fury—at her husband, at the men undermining him, at the world undermining her—and comes closest to the stellar line from the senate hearing. That line, though, it just overshadows everything, even the big bomb drop. “Did you ever stop to think,” the disillusioned aide says to Strauss, “that they didn’t talk about you at all? That they had more important things to talk about?” A lesser actor than Alden Ehrenreich would make a meal out of that line, but he delivers it with devastating casualness, as if it’s so obvious a thought it isn’t even worth the breath it takes to utter it. In truth, no one knows what Oppenheimer and Einstein talked about that day at Princeton, but Lewis Strauss built his reality around the idea that it was him. How silly of him! How asinine! At its best, Oppenheimer is not a Great Man biopic, it’s not a technical marvel of filmmaking, it’s not a cracking thriller about the race to end World War II, and it’s definitely not a meditation on the consequences of using nuclear weapons. At its best, Oppenheimer is a story about small, petty men changing the world for the worse because they cannot fathom that THEY are not the center of it. It’s a cautionary tale less about nuclear power and more about the deleterious effect of self-important men on those around them. Oppenheimer dismisses Einstein as the best mind of his generation, past his prime and no longer on the cutting edge, but Einstein is, in fact, old enough to know that it’s not about him, a lesson literally no other man in this film learns until it’s too late. Oppenheimer is good enough, and long enough, that everyone will have a different favorite part, though I suspect what will linger longest is not the history lesson, or the cinematic gee-whizzery, but the look on Strauss’s face when someone points out that maybe he wasn’t the main character all along. Sometimes, a person comes along and can change the world as J. Robert Oppenheimer did, ushering in the nuclear age. But always there are those men like Lewis Strauss, manipulating people and events to satisfy their vindicative agendas made up of imagined slights. We only have to cope with a transformative genius like Oppenheimer occasionally—and sometimes they even improve the world, with art and music and beauty—but we always have to navigate the detritus of the aggrieved egos of men like Strauss. Oppenheimer is about genius, about a man, about a bomb, but it’s also about the waste laid to the world by weak men.  This review was published during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes of 2023. The work being reviewed would not exist without the labor of writers and actors. Oppenheimer is exclusively in theaters from July 21, 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 28, 2023"," Cillian Murphy plays scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The story unfolds in two separate manners. Black-and-white sections detail the efforts of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) to be confirmed as Secretary of Commerce and being grilled about his past support of Oppenheimer, who was a controversial person as of 1959. If his answers don’t satisfy the Senate committee members, Strauss will become the first candidate in decades to be denied confirmation. The heat is on. Color sections show us significant events from Oppenheimer’s life, most notably his torrid affair with Communist Party USA member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his occasionally rocky marriage to wife Kitty (Emily Blunt). Of course, the film’s primary focus is his work developing the atomic bomb. Clashes and collaborations with Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) are shown. So is the building of a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the area he determines to be the most suitable place to test the bomb. All these episodes are flashbacks, as Oppenheimer is being interrogated by a special committee that will decide if his security clearance will be renewed. The centerpiece, naturally, is the assembly and test of the atomic bomb. Nolan achieves relentless ticking-clock suspense in how he approaches the movie overall and this facet, in particular. Oppenheimer is made up of scenes that usually last less than a minute. We’re given exactly what we need to know, with no unnecessary frills. Each short scene is played for full dramatic effect. Consequently, the race to build an A-bomb before Nazi Germany does has the urgency it requires. History books have told us how it went down. Nolan’s depiction brings it nerve-rattlingly alive. The last of the film’s three fast-moving hours is dedicated to the aftermath, as Oppenheimer becomes a pariah for criticizing how his creation was used in war. (The Strauss arc is most prominent here.) Cillian Murphy’s work throughout is staggering. He brilliantly shows the duality of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who feels the irresistible thrill of making a historic scientific breakthrough as profoundly as he feels grief knowing his work led to the deaths of so many people. Nolan provides the structure, but Murphy infuses it with three-dimensional humanity. Every supporting performance is right on the money, with Downey, Jr. shedding his usual quirky mannerisms to disappear into character as Strauss. Blunt and Pugh both shine as the women who factor significantly into the titular subject’s life. Much has been made of the steamy sex scenes between Murphy and Pugh. They aren’t exploitive, though. The romantic/sexual elements in the movie help put Oppenheimer’s life into fuller context, allowing us to see him as a man rather than as just an important historical figure. Not a single second of Oppenheimer is wasted. With his impeccable cast, Nolan crafts a hard-hitting, thoroughly engrossing movie that conveys the significance of the atomic bomb’s formation, for better or worse. The director doesn’t merely recount actual events, he makes it clear why those events from decades ago remain relevant to every single one of us today. This is an extraordinary motion picture.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023"," Christopher Nolan pulls out the stops as only he can to bring to the big screen, in the grandest possible way, the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb who lived to see the devastation and long-term dangers that his weapon of mass destruction unleashed on the world. Oppenheimer, a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance, achieves a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. Through all the layers that constitute the film, what peeps out most prominently is the director's unambiguous acknowledgement of the ethical questions that surround the brilliant American theoretical physicist's legacy. At a more superficial level, the film gives the writer-director the scope to orchestrate the elements of space and time in a straightforward but a highly enthralling manner and tap the dramatic potential of the tragic story of a genius who pushed the boundaries of quantum physics only to trigger a dangerous arms race. The three-hour epic is about a man, quantum physics, and a point in history, but it comes off as a timeless, almost Shakespearean morality tale about an impossible achievement and its horrific consequences. The film crammed with diverse narrative and spatial elements that Nolan and his cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema harness and press into the service of an engrossing story about science, war and political vendetta. It isn't, however, only the formal attributes of the film that are impressive. Its thematic depth turns it into an introspection (no matter how wordy) on science, weapons and the horrors of war without actually putting footage of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and their effects on the screen. As a scientist who unwittingly armed the human race with a self-destruct button, Oppenheimer, played with unwavering solidity by regular Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy, is presented as a genius who pays as high a price for his deadly invention as he does for his subsequent decision to turn into an advocate for nuclear arms control. The excitement of scientific research, the upshots by political exigencies and the workings of personal relationships are all woven into the dense but never less than dynamic storyline. Nolan, with the aid of Murphy, turns Oppenheimer into a figure who inspires awe and admiration to begin with. But as a powerful adversary turns against him and seeks to corner him by harping on his pro-left affiliations, the hero turns into a hapless victim of a ""kangaroo court."" The atomic bomb that Oppenheimer delivers to the US military does bring World War II to an end in the Pacific, but it also starts a public battle that a national hero has to fight to protect his own reputation as well as a moral conflict that is triggered by pangs of guilt. Parts of Oppenheimer come close to being weighed down by an information overload, but in Nolan's hand every little piece that goes into the narrative and every single actor, irrespective of the length of the role or the significance of the presence, has considerable weight. The film alternates between luminous colour and vivid black-and-white as it straddles several decades in the life of the protagonist - from his days as a student in the 1920 to his years as a greying man struggling till the end of his life to live down his controversial legacy. Nolan's screenplay splits the story into three broad segments. The centrepiece is the complex and arduous process of the building of the bomb as part of the Manhattan Project at a clandestine laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, headed by Oppenheimer, manned by some of the most exceptional scientists of the era and operated under the military supervision of the curt General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon). Intercut into the mid-1940s core section of the story are a 1959 confirmation hearing (filmed in black and white) for the elevation to the cabinet of the former chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Admiral Lewis Strauss (a barely recognisable Robert Downey Jr.) and a 1954 security clearance inquiry against Oppenheimer. Both enhance the kinetic energy that courses through the tale. The rhythm of Jennifer Lame's editing imparts sustained momentum to the film as it cuts back and forth between the three blocks. The pace never flags. The film plays out like a cross between a richly textured saga of an epochal scientific achievement and an inquisition into decisions and acts that have had a far-reaching impact on the world. Oppenheimer does a staggeringly good job of transporting the audience to another era, but it speaks to our time in a way that is palpable and relevant. It is the sort of film that is as a much a story of an individual and his contentious achievement as of an entire century caught in an endless cycle of war and human suffering.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant quantum physicist and ‘father of the atomic bomb’ who was later haunted by what he’d created. Starring Cillian Murphy, and his cheekbones, the film is dense, ambitious, complex, so very long (three hours) and impressive, even if it does drag by the end. (When a film is so very long, that’s the price you pay.) I could go on and on but, for many, the main selling point will be this: it isn’t Barbie and it isn’t pink. It’s a Nolan film so, of course, it’s not chronological storytelling. I pity his wife. I bet he can’t even go to the shops without recounting his journey in splintered fragments she’ll have to piece together. (‘Chris, please just start at the beginning…’) It is jumpy and agitated and hops around several timelines, with no dates or context given, which is a headache. And it also jumps between colour and black and white, sometimes changing mid-scene, which is also a headache. But while it’s a headache, and challenging and difficult, it is never as annoyingly baffling as, say, Tenet. Or Interstellar. The film covers Oppenheimer’s early career as a dazzling student and professor, and one problem Nolan has is: how do you put theoretical physics on screen? There are long equations on blackboards, obviously, but we might suddenly cut to fireballs, or stars collapsing, which does give us some sense of how Oppenheimer sees the world. Other timelines follow him building the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos in New Mexico during the second world war and we also view him in the 1950s when, having realised that his creation had a limitless capacity for destruction, he campaigned for international regulations while Washington just wanted him to shut up and go away. (If that’s all the thanks you get for developing the next generation of weapon, I’m glad I never bothered.) There are the big, explosive, spectacular set-pieces, like the first nuclear test in the desert in 1945, with its mushroom cloud and blinding white light and deafening noise. It’s genuinely tense. Did you know there was a chance the atmosphere would catch fire and destroy the world? But otherwise the film is mostly a succession of men talking in rooms, and there are so many men that you will wonder: which man is this again? Is it the mathematician? Is it the one keen on developing a hydrogen bomb? The cast is stacked with A-list stars who appear on screen for two minutes, tops. Kenneth Branagh appears on screen for two minutes tops, and Rami Malek, and Gary Oldman as President Truman. Truman and Oppenheimer meet after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. ‘I have blood on my hands,’ mourns Oppenheimer. ‘Don’t let that cry-baby into this office again,’ Truman says to an aide as Oppenheimer is on his way out. It’s a terrific scene. The politics, which by the end has the feel of a courtroom drama, occupies the third act, which is when it starts to drag. The film  also weaves in Oppenheimer’s romantic life, just about. He had a wife (Emily Blunt) and a lover (Florence Pugh) but they are, alas, the most under-developed characters in the script. Pugh, in fact, doesn’t get to do much except be naked. But as a character portrait of Oppenheimer, does it work? It doesn’t quite crack him open. Murphy’s performance is intense and compelling, but he also brings the same inscrutability that characterised his Peaky Blinders work. He is Oscar-bound, some say, but the bigger revelation is probably Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, who served on the US Atomic Energy Commission. Downey is slyly mesmerising and it may be, after all those Marvel films, I’d simply forgotten he can act. It is an event of a film that’s worth seeing but the main thing? It isn’t pink.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," Scientists are elevated to celebrity status, and their brain power is aspirational -- as is their perseverance and ability to work as a team to accomplish a daunting goal. Most characters -- historical figures from the 1930s–'50s -- are White American or European men. Oppenheimer and many of the other scientists, including Albert Einstein, are Jewish (though the main Jewish characters aren't portrayed by Jewish actors). One female scientist is featured, and other women can be spotted working in the background. The victims of the atomic bomb detonations (Japanese people, interned Japanese Americans, and Native Americans) don't have a voice in the film. A sex scene that includes White characters reading from the holy Hindu text the Bhagavad Gita has drawn complaints for being insensitive/offensive. Death by suicide. Massive fiery, loud bomb explosion, accompanied by a loud ""doom"" score that underlines the future impact of the detonation. Discussion of the impact of the atomic bomb on the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In a hallucination, the skin on a woman's face appears to blow off. Attempted murder through the eyes of the protagonist. Parents need to know that Oppenheimer is director Christopher Nolan's drama about J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the scientist responsible for the creation of the atomic bomb. But it's less an entertaining history lesson than it is a dense examination of the unholy matrimony of quantum physics and military bureaucracy, and things can get pretty confusing thanks to frequent undated time jumps and a barrage of names and characters to keep straight. The sex scenes (Nolan's first) include frequent partial nudity (particularly co-star Florence Pugh's breasts). Characters smoke, as would be expected in the 1930s–'50s setting, and drink. A bomb trial demonstrates the enormousness of the weapon's capabilities, with fire, noise, and smoke. But viewers are told about, rather than shown, the horror that unfolded after the bomb was ultimately dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. There are references to mass assassination and to suicide, and a brief hallucination of a young woman's skin appearing to blow off. Language includes a few uses of ""f--k,"" plus ""goddamn,"" ""s--t,"" and more. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, OPPENHEIMER follows brilliant scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he studies and masters quantum physics. As the United States enters World War II, Oppenheimer is tapped to assemble and lead a group of allied scientists to create a war-ending bomb. Like J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan is a genius -- and, also like Oppenheimer, he may be too close to his subject matter to realize that he lost the thread. It's now abundantly clear that Nolan is fascinated with World War II, but it may be hard for many viewers (even those who love history) to follow this story with ease. If you need a reference card, captions, the ability to pause and rewind the film, and Wikipedia on standby to understand what's going on, it's an issue. And if some viewers' thoughts start drifting to wondering how Aaron Sorkin, Ron Howard, or Steven Spielberg might have made this movie better, that's a big problem. The atomic bomb is just part of the story in Oppenheimer -- the plot is actually more about whether the leader of The Manhattan Project will get his security clearance renewed a decade after the end of World War II. Really. And given that Oppenheimer apparently wasn't the greatest guy (the film softens the fact that he apparently tried to murder his teacher), it's difficult to invest or care. Nolan is beloved for creating cinematic puzzles that challenge viewers' intellect and keep us on our toes -- we may sometimes be confused, but we know it's part of the long game. Here, he tries to play that game with viewers again, but it doesn't really work in a biopic that's directed at having audiences examine the morality of innovation. Nolan seems to intend for us to question our present race into artificial intelligence, but the film only leaves us questioning him. Families can talk about the real-life moral dilemma of building a weapon of mass destruction. Given the circumstances, do you think the scientists had another choice? If you create something powerful, can you be sure it won't be misused in someone else's hands -- and should that worry impede innovation? Discuss the fears and accusations related to Communism in the 1950s. Who were the victims? How does Oppenheimer show how McCarthyism was used to target opponents? Do you see any modern parallels?

"Jul 27, 2023"," 
As dazzling as Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style often is, he still can't escape the trappings of the historical biopic with his three-hour epic Oppenheimer, an overstuffed and often overwhelming account of the man known as the ""father of the atomic bomb."" Spanning a period of decades in the life of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the movie builds to one of the most important events in human history and then spends another hour on petty political squabbles. Nolan gives nearly equal weight to these two elements, framing the story around a pair of contentious government hearings.
 
The first is the 1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing about revoking Oppenheimer's security clearance, ostensibly over his potential communist sympathies. Oppenheimer's testimony covers his entire career, from his time as a student in Europe in the 1920s to his leadership of the Manhattan Project, the government initiative to develop the first atomic bomb during World War II. It's a familiar biopic structural device, and Nolan mostly sticks to it, toning down the nonlinear storytelling he's known for.
 
The movie still jumps around in time, though, mainly in its depiction of a second, much more public government hearing, the Senate's confirmation of Secretary of Commerce nominee Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) in 1959. For anyone not familiar with the details of Oppenheimer's life, it's not immediately clear what Strauss' confirmation has to do with Oppenheimer, even after the movie shows Strauss recruiting Oppenheimer for an academic position following the war. Strauss' presence seems almost superfluous for the first two-thirds of the movie, as Nolan devotes most of his attention to the monumental project of developing the bomb.
 
That's when Oppenheimer is at its most gripping, as Oppenheimer is recruited by Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to oversee the top-secret program headquartered at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Oppenheimer hand-picks a team of scientists to join him at a location that he's also hand-picked, and he's both arrogant enough and brilliant enough to run things his own way, sometimes even in opposition to the military's preferences. Murphy plays Oppenheimer as confident but troubled, and while he's sometimes inscrutable, both to his associates and to the audience, he's always captivating.
 
Nolan himself is both arrogant enough and brilliant enough to recruit an absurdly stacked cast of familiar faces, many of whom show up to deliver just a handful of lines. The extensive array of scientists are hard to tell apart, even when played by recognizable actors, and very few of them exhibit any distinctive personality. Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, and Florence Pugh, as his mistress Jean Tatlock, make slightly more memorable impressions, but ultimately the supporting characters are all subordinate to Oppenheimer.
 
That's what makes Strauss' prominent position in the movie's third hour so frustrating, especially after the bravura presentation of the Manhattan Project's successful nuclear test. The deployment of the bomb seems like it would be the climax of Oppenheimer's story, but instead Nolan digs into the minutiae of those government hearings, which shift from framing devices to the primary focus. Nolan relies on awe-inspiring practical effects to illustrate the all-consuming power of the first nuclear detonation and its impact on Oppenheimer, which contrasts with the stark black-and-white visuals of the Strauss scenes.

"Jul 27, 2023"," Reviewing movies is a wonderful job. It is, nonetheless, a job. And even post-pandemic, the thought of being in a large, enclosed space with people who’ve been exposed to Lord-knows-what wasn’t…well…wasn’t my idea of a good time. Then along came Escobar. And then, as well, along came this past weekend, which some Hollywood bottom-feeder decided to christen “Barbenheimer ”  – as in the twin openings of the films, “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer.” “Barbie” beckoned, but the responsible choice was “Oppenheimer,” three-plus hours of sorta’ recent history about how J. Robert Oppenheimer learned to stop worrying and fear the bomb. As in, his bomb. The atomic bomb, which he invented. “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds” he supposedly uttered, quoting the Bhagavad Gita. In the original Sanskrit. In Christopher Nolan’s admirable if imperfect biographical epic, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) reads those words – in the original Sanskrit – from a book perched on his mistress Jean Tatlock’s (Florence Pugh) original (presumably) bare breasts. (Context: she’s straddling him as they make love.) My point, I guess, is that while “Oppenheimer” is over-long and over-crowded with white guys in unflattering suits saying mostly unflattering things about our titular protagonist, the movie is also formidable. It tackles a serious topic – the life and times of the man who invented the instrument by which humans could destroy ourselves – and doesn’t pull punches. Here’s J. Robert Oppenheimer’s story, Nolan insists.  Here’s all of it.  Hence the hefty running time. The film takes us from the American physicist’s early days as a gifted grad student in England and Germany in the 1920s, through his prolonged and impassioned work on the bomb, his anointment as a national hero and his eventual martyrdom in the 1950s at the hands of the Atomic Energy Commission.  And they are…? A bunch of self-serving politicians (are there any other kind in movies?) led by the devious Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). This is shown as Washington power-mongering at its most repulsive – a closed-door, hush-hush hearing which pits the imperfect but essentially innocent Oppenheimer against a squadron of men for whom political backstabbing is the very air they breathe.  These scenes provide a framework (and pretty much the last hour) for Nolan’s version of the Big Bang Theory, i.e., who Oppenheimer was, what he did and why it was done.  As someone says, the scientists provide the cards; the bureaucrats decide how the hand is played. The picture is often eerily beautiful, perhaps never more so than when showing us the bomb being tested in the middle of nowhere (i.e., Los Alamos, New Mexico). The movie goes silent – deadly silent – as a Biblical pillar of fire rises in the desert. “Bring in the sheets,” Oppenheimer tells his frustrated, alcoholic wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) earlier that day, giving a semi-demented domestic touch to the day the world changed.  “Oppenheimer’s” talkiness can tire you out. As can the sheer number of topics it tackles, everything from anti-Semitism to power-politics gamesmanship to why we dropped the bomb after the Nazis were already defeated.  Nolan’s cinematic mastery helps a lot, as does his impressive cast which brims with memorable performances alongside blink-and-you’ll-miss-‘em cameos (Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, among others). Blunt is remarkable as Kitty whose underwritten character is mostly viewed through a flask in her purse and an empty cocktail glass. So is Matt Damon as Oppenheimer’s military keeper (foursquare among the slithery bureaucrats). And Downey, having almost singlehandedly destroyed the movies (I am become Iron Man…) is obviously out for a best supporting actor Oscar. One that, in this case, would be well-deserved.  Holding it all together is Murphy, a slim Irish actor with ice-blue eyes. He understands his character’s contradictions; more importantly, he has an uncanny instinct for how to reveal them. For Oppenheimer, the A-Bomb isn’t just a weapon of mass destruction. It’s also his masterpiece.  His Beethoven’s 9th. His Sistine Chapel. When he finally dons his trademark fedora and pipe, it’ s like watching a superhero (or villain?) don his spandex costume. With great power comes great responsibility. Good article but you missed a critical moment in the film about the sheets outside….Oppenheimer isn’t allowed to tell anyone (no one can tell anyone anything) about the test so he whispers to his wife that if the test happens, he will telephone her & tell her to bring in the sheets…and that would be the secret code between them.

"Jul 27, 2023"," As a film Oppenheimer is paradoxical in its cinematic nature. It’s a taut character study, and a clock-ticking thriller as explosive as the big bang. Ultimately, you can’t escape the blast radius of Nolan’s storytelling, the scale of it, it’s colossal, it’s everything, it’s the kind of magic that drops jaws and mesmerizes eyeballs.  The core focus of the film follows the visionary Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), a Jewish scientist who’s in a race against time to build a nuclear weapon before the Nazis. But his efforts are threatened by his chaotic emotional nature, and ties to the communist party.  Oppenheimer wages a war with himself and his critics as he struggles to build the bomb.  Nolan cleverly uses two timelines, contrasting the rise of Oppenheimer the genius, with the public fall of the older Oppenheimer who believes nuclear weapons are a threat to humanity.  As the film builds momentum there’s a confluence between these two Oppenheimers, thus confirming he’s both men at once. The film’s visual structure and editing reflect the paradox of Oppenheimer’s life, as both the genius and the sinner.  It’s a film about Paradox, and it’s as much about the beauty and celebration of science as it’s about the horrors caused by it, and a potent reminder of the complex and contradictory natures of human beings.",POSITIVE

"Jul 27, 2023"," Cillian Murphy plays physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, called “the father of the atomic bomb,” in writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biographical drama “Oppenheimer.” (Photo by Melinda Sue Gordon, courtesy of Universal Pictures.) With “Oppenheimer,” writer-director Christopher Nolan may have finally found a subject — a prickly genius who managed to compartmentalize his life so that unlocking the whole man and his world-shattering contribution to history requires some mental gymnastics — that fits perfectly with his puzzle-box style of filmmaking. Nolan’s subject is J. Robert Oppenheimer, who after 1945 was called “the father of the atomic bomb.” Before 1945, Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) was a theoretical physicist who traveled across Europe in order to learn from the experts in the field — including Danish physicist Neils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and the German Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), before settling into positions at Cal-Berkeley and CalTech, to delve into a new field called quantum mechanics.  Oppenheimer understands the theory, and it’s up to others to find the practical applications. One of those others is his next-door colleague, Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), who is building what will be known as a cyclotron — colloquially, an atom smasher. After the Germans invade Poland in 1939, Oppenheimer and his colleagues discuss the horrific possibility that splitting the atom could lead to a weapon of war, an atomic bomb. In 1942, Col. (and later General) Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) is seeking out scientists to start developing such a bomb, saying that the Nazis are 12 months ahead in their research. Oppenheimer tells Groves it’s 18 months — because the Nazis have Heisenberg on their side — and agrees to lead the organization of a secret lab. Oppenheimer chooses a site he knows, where he and his brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold), have some ranch property, in New Mexico. He names the facility Los Alamos. Nolan’s script tells Oppenheimer’s story largely in flashback, and structures the narrative around two hearings, one private, one public. The private hearing, in 1954, was to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance, over his past associations with Communists and socialists (including an effort to unionize research staff at Cal-Berkeley). The public hearing, in 1959, is of a U.S. Senate committee questioning Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, whose confirmation for a cabinet post is hung up over Strauss’ connections to Oppenheimer — whom Strauss offered the job as director of the Institute of Advance Study at Princeton, whose emeritus professors included Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), depicted here as a mentor and moral compass for Oppenheimer. Among the many boxes in Oppenheimer’s compartmentalized life — along with scientist, theorist, activist, wartime hero and post-war advocate against developing the hydrogen bomb — an important one depicted here is lover. As a Cal-Berkeley professor, he has a torrid love affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a psychology professor, but they break up in 1939. The same year, he meets Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt), who at the time is on her third marriage, to a physician — but she divorces him to marry Oppenheimer after becoming pregnant.  Downey’s Strauss (pronounced “straws”) leads a deep bench of supporting roles in this sprawling, three-hour biography. Besides Blunt, Hartnett, Conti and Damon, totable cast members are Alden Ehrenreich as a Senate aide advising Strauss during his confirmation, Jason Clarke and Macon Blair as lawyers on opposite sides in Oppenheimer’s security hearing, David Dastmalchian as an FBI snitch, Dane DeHaan as Groves’ squirrelly aide, and Rami Malek as another scientist. Perhaps the most intriguing side player is Benny Safdie as Oppenheimer’s fellow physicist Edward Teller, with whom Oppenheimer argues about the next step in the development of atomic weapons: A hydrogen bomb, the power of which Oppenheimer believes may be more than any country should possess. Murphy’s central performance is extraordinary, his angularity embodying the either-or binary of Oppenheimer’s thought processes. All of the troubles of his world — the Nazis winning the war, the Soviets getting the bomb, the Americans destroying themselves through fear and paranoia, the scandals threatening to wreck his career and marriage — play out on Murphy’s face, each one like a math problem he’s determined to solve. Nolan deploys a range of visual devices — shooting in 70mm IMAX and 35mm film, with the Strauss hearings in crisp black and white and other events in vivid color — to keep the narrative threads straight. The look is luminous, with Hoyte Van Hoytema’s cinematography, Ruth De Jong’s period-perfect production design and Ellen Mirojnick’s gorgeous costume design all contributing. As always with Nolan, the sound design is propulsive and overwhelming, particularly in the re-creation of the first atomic test blast. Some have criticized “Oppenheimer” for giving short shrift to the countless victims that resulted from Oppenheimer’s work — notably, the Indigenous people of New Mexico affected by atomic fallout and the Japanese people on whom atomic bombs were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Those are touched on briefly, though it’s valid to argue that more could be said, even in a three-hour movie. The broader message Nolan conveys brilliantly is that the atomic bomb, no matter how it was justified during World War II and the Cold War, has given the world the horrible ability to destroy ourselves in a matter of minutes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," Whether we understand and embrace it or not, we are a product of history. Yesterday invariably shapes who we are today and foreshadows what we may become tomorrow. Even those who actively seek to reject history are undeniably affected by it. Somewhere between Larry Mann’s introduction to American history at Tyrone Middle School and John Welch’s AP American history class at Seminole High School, I picked up most of the key points about World War II. I learned about the Allied Powers and the Axis, the world leaders who guided their nations through those calamitous years, and the events that precipitated the conflict. I memorized timelines and significant dates, and I listened as teachers tried to convey to their students why all of it mattered — and about how the outcome of the war continued to affect the world. It didn’t occur to me at the time that my very existence was dependent upon the outcome of World War II. More specifically, it may have been dependent upon J. Robert Oppenheimer, credited as the “father of the atomic bomb.” A new biographical thriller, “Oppenheimer,” chronicles the life of the American theoretical physicist. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is based upon “American Prometheus,” a biography written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Cillian Murphy stars as Oppenheimer. “Oppenheimer” is engrossing, devastating, and overwhelming. Nolan focuses on the titular character’s deeply conflicted conscience and the moral dilemma that haunted him from the moment he conceived the idea of creating an atomic bomb to Trinity, the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, on July 16, 1945. Events are depicted in a nonlinear fashion, alternating between Oppenheimer’s studies at Cambridge in the mid 1920s, to his work at Los Alamos in the 1940s, to a United States Atomic Energy Commission security hearing in 1954, and to the confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) in 1959. Along the way, Nolan reveals Oppenheimer’s temperament and his idiosyncrasies through his various relationships, including his marriage to Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt) and his intermittent affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) as well as peers such as Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Nolan’s film is an intense, enlightening character study of a complicated and tormented individual keenly aware that his work is both imminently necessary and potentially cataclysmic. Simultaneously, the film critiques the government’s treatment of scientists and exposes its willful disregard of scientific expertise when evidence does not align with the prevailing ideology. “Oppenheimer” challenges viewers. It is intellectually demanding, thought-provoking, and terrifying. It inspires a sense of awe, deep empathy, and existential dread. It is as perceptive in its reflections upon human nature as it is pessimistic about the future. But pessimism can be a valuable commodity. Gen X saw the world differently. The prior demographic cohort grew up thinking that a quick duck-and-cover maneuver under the school desk could protect them from a volley of Soviet nuclear warheads raining down over the countryside. In a worst-case scenario, they expected to hole up in a fully-stocked bomb shelter in their backyard, where they would eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, read comic books and wait for local authorities to broadcast an “all-clear” notification. Gen X took a different approach to the constant threat of nuclear war. Cynical and disaffected, Gen X expected the world to end at any moment — and kept going anyway. We shouldered our anxiety like exhausted champs. Thanks to films like “The Day After” in 1983 and “Threads” in 1984, Gen X understood there would be no winners in the next global conflict. For us, the post-apocalyptic wastelands of “Damnation Alley” and “Mad Max” were akin to the Land of Oz. “While the movie tries to help the audience understand why people have done the things they’ve done, it’s at the same time asking should they have done the things they’ve done,” Nolan says in the production notes for the film. “And film, as a narrative medium, is uniquely suited to pulling an audience into a subjective experience, letting them judge things the way the characters judge them, while at the same time looking at these characters a little more objectively. “At various points, we try to burrow into Oppenheimer’s psyche and take the audience on his emotional journey. That was the challenge of the film: To tell the story of a person who was involved in what was ultimately an extraordinary destructive sequence of events, but done for the right reasons, and tell it from his point of view.” Part political thriller, part character study, “Oppenheimer” revolves around difficult decisions that forever altered the trajectory of civilization. It is filled with outstanding performances from its ensemble cast. Anchored by stunning cinematography, the film often moves at such an accelerated pace it feels like Nolan is an impatient docent, wrenching museum visitors through each exhibit hall without allowing them time to fully ingest what they’re seeing. Those glimpses, though, all coalesce into one brooding epic, and collectively they enrich Nolan’s gifted storytelling. It is beautifully and meticulously constructed to evoke reverence as well as trepidation. It offers an impressionistic glance into the mind of a genius, and a bleak extrapolation of the Manhattan Project’s long-term repercussions. Nolan doesn’t have to tell me how Oppenheimer impacted me, personally. My father served with the 87th Infantry Division in Europe. He was in a hospital in May 1945 on VE-Day when Germany surrendered. Had the United States been forced to launch a full-scale invasion of Japan, he would have been transferred to the Pacific Theater. In late July 1945, the U.S. War Department provided an estimate that Operation Downfall — the name given to the invasion and occupation of Japan — would cause between 1.7 to 4 million U.S. casualties, including between 400,000 and 800,000 U.S. dead, and 5 to 10 million Japanese dead. We carry the legacy — and the burden — of history. It informs our purpose and our potential. It is a source of counsel and caution. Those who choose to ignore it, deny it, reshape it to suit their own agenda or expurgate it to gain political capital are choosing a dangerous path. Learning from the past — both our achievements and our failures — enables us to build a better future, if that is the path we choose.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," It wasn’t “The Flash” or any other superhero sequel. Not even Tom Cruise and the latest stunt-driven “Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One” could garner the kind of buzz the double feature known as Barbenheimer has amassed. Of course, that’s Greta Gerwig’s pop culture “Barbie” starring Margot Robbie as the iconic doll, and auteur filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s epic historical talking drama “Oppenheimer,” which released on the same day, catering to very different audiences, both flourishing with creativity and originality. Distributed by rival studios Warner Bros. (“Barbie”) and Universal (“Oppenheimer”), not even the greatest PR stuntman could have imagined how social media would create such a marketing tool. Instead of rivalry, it became a double ticket event. Cinemas are cashing in as well, actively scheduling the showtimes so patrons can see both films, which results in over five hours of continuous viewing if you choose. Should you see the two most talked about films in one sitting? It’s a jolting experience going from a comedy that’s full of color and performances to such an intense wartime experience. Both filmmakers are challenging themselves in new ways that pay off in dividends. Following the success of “Lady Bird” and “Little Women,” “Barbie” is the most commercial and big-budget outing for actress turned Oscar-nominated director. The creativity in the script by Gerwig and her husband Noah Baumbach is the highlight and is sure to garner awards consideration in that category. Internet forum rules ...

"Jul 27, 2023"," This is Paul Salfen with your KLAK Movie Minute. In theaters this weekend is Oppenheimer, the amazing story of the man who engineered the atomic bomb from director Christopher Nolan and it’s just as epic as you might think. Clocking in at 3 hours and being shown in 35mm and 70mm in a lot of theaters, this important true stories wrestles with a lot of interesting ideas, philosophies, and the innerworkings of brilliant but flawed people. Cillian Murphy plays the namesake perfectly and is backed up by a who’s who of great talent that includes Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Kenneth Branaugh, and Florence Pugh. It’s hard to believe sometimes that history has played out the way it has and the heroes and villains we learned about in school are much more complicated creatures than we could have wrapped our heads around at a young age. To see it fleshed out in a meticulous way really brings the historical events to life and gives us a lot to think about coupled with a great excuse to go to the movies. That’s it for this week. Join me next week and every week for another Movie Minute right here on 97.5 KLAK, AMFM Magazine, and RECRD.",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," The film presents several timelines at once. Among those, we see Oppenheimer as a student at Cambridge, where he’s haunted by visions of exploding cosmos and infinite doom. We see him as a professor at UC Berkeley, where he is the first man to bring quantum physics to the U.S. We see him at Los Alamos, where he builds the bomb. And we see him in a closed door hearing, where he’s in danger of losing his security clearance.

"Jul 27, 2023"," There can be no Barbie without Oppenheimer. What a time to be alive!  The perfect double feature. Let's push the button on Christopher Nolan's IMAX spectacle, that is the J. Robert Oppenheimer story. A Nolan Batman faithful, Irish actor Cillian Murphy comes out of the Scarecrow shadows and into the leading man spotlight. And light that fuse he does on IMAX, across the three-hour running time, Murphy is well and truly ready for his close-up. Layer upon layer of Oppy's life as a ground-breaking physicist and the great minds around him who throw themselves headlong into The Manhattan Project, into beating Germany to the bomb.  Yet more layers personal and political as his history with the Communist Party and the women he loves and leaves give his enemies the clubs they need to beat him. Nolan has delivered his most Oscar-baiting cinematic opus yet, drawing award-worthy performances from his cast. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr are the stand-outs and blowing our minds once again with this deeply immersive all-senses story-telling. It's potent, frightening and explosive. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 27, 2023"," If you’re a member of any dynasty prominent in twentieth-century political history—with Roosevelts, Churchills, Windsors, and Kennedys at the forefront—your relatives are certain to be reincarnated in a nondocumentary film sooner or later. The halo effect of those families’ global fame sometimes also encompasses lesser participants on the periphery of momentous events. So when I read that Christopher Nolan, the British-American director best known for his Dark Knight Batman trilogy, would make his next feature about the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, what excited me most was personal. Often called the father of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer was a longstanding intimate and colleague of I. I. Rabi (rhymes with “hobby”), winner of the 1944 Nobel Prize in Physics and a first cousin of my paternal grandfather. To this day members of the Rabi branch of our Stammbaum, whom I call my nuclear family, still refer to the physicist by his nickname, Oppie. I immediately flew to IMDB and found that, alongside the Irish actor Cillian Murphy in the title role, Rabi was to be played by David Krumholtz, whom I’d seen as a Seventies porn producer in the raunchy HBO miniseries The Deuce from 2017–2019. I was curious what Rabi’s direct descendants would make of his cinematic embodiment and those of other people portrayed in the film, whom they knew far better than I did. Thus I invited Rabi’s younger daughter, my cousin Margaret Rabi Beels—an eighty-eight-year-old retired social worker and family therapist who lives in Manhattan—to attend an advance screening with my wife and me along with her husband and their son. During my youth Oppenheimer was the world’s most famous scientist after Einstein—a stature he achieved by directing the Manhattan Project’s desert laboratory in Los Alamos, where he led an unruly pack of young scientists to build the first nuclear weapon. His death at sixty-two in 1967, of throat cancer from decades of relentless chain-smoking, made the front page of The New York Times. Since then he’s inspired an unusual number of theater pieces for a scientist, including at least three plays, two musicals, and an opera performed at the Met. Having admired Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s magisterial 2005 study American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, I was encouraged to learn that Nolan used it as the basis for his screenplay. The book brought me back to my early familiarity with Oppenheimer’s story, which combines the mythic import of the Ring cycle with humanizing details that exemplify the inextricable links between world-changing occurrences and the minutiae of everyday life. In our household when I was growing up, Rabi was a veritable deity, and because of his four decades as a Columbia physics professor I never seriously imagined going to any other college. After I matriculated there in 1966, Rabi and his wife, Helen, would invite me for dinner at their Riverside Drive apartment. During the first of those Sunday night get-togethers, I brought up Oppenheimer, who, they confided, was desperately ill with the disease that would kill him the following February. Then I mentioned having recently read Lansing Lamont’s history of the Manhattan Project, Day of Trinity (1965). Describing the physicist’s response to the trial of the first atomic bomb at Alamogordo, New Mexico, in July 1945, a month before Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Lamont wrote that at the climactic moment of the explosion, Oppenheimer spontaneously recalled Krishna’s words from the Bhagavad Gita: “I am become Death,/The destroyer of worlds.” As I repeated this episode to the Rabis, there was a discernible chill. “Oppie’s problem,” the physicist responded, “is that he forgets he’s a Jew.” Because Rabi was completely nonobservant (his lifelong attitude toward religion was “I don’t need fairy tales”), he saw his friend’s spiritual vagaries not as a sacrilege but as an apostasy of reason unforgiveable in a scientist. Yet one should never discount competitiveness even at the highest levels of achievement. I’m certain that Rabi and his wife also felt that Oppenheimer had become far too celebrated as the philosopher king of science rather than for his actual discoveries, which Rabi’s research far outstripped. His work on nuclear magnetic resonance, the basis for both radar and the MRI, won him the Nobel. Oppenheimer was nominated for the prize three times but never received it. According to Bird and Sherwin, “In the rarefied world of physics, Rabi would come to be regarded as the deep thinker and Oppenheimer as the great synthesizer.” From the outset Rabi had moral qualms about the development of nuclear weapons. “I was strongly opposed to bombing ever since 1931, when I saw those pictures of the Japanese bombing that suburb of Shanghai,” he reminisced late in life. “You drop a bomb and it falls on the just and the unjust. There is no escape from it.… I didn’t like it then and I don’t now.” He resisted Oppenheimer’s pleas to join his New Mexico team, instead spending the war years at MIT perfecting radar, which he thought was more crucial to achieving victory. Helen Rabi reinforced her husband’s decision by refusing to go because the desert encampment would not have a decent school for their daughters. (Educating the children, war or not, was a major concern for many in the Oppenheimer orbit. Margaret’s main memory of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as a ten-year-old in August 1945, is that finally they could all return to New York from Cambridge because her father’s war work there was finished, while her mother had to quickly pull strings to get her and her older sister, Nancy, into Brearley in time for the start of classes a month later.) Only occasionally did Rabi visit Los Alamos as a consultant. “I was not a member of any of their important committees,” he said of the Manhattan Project years afterward, “but just Oppenheimer’s advisor.” He was, however, present at the explosion that changed world history, and even won $102 in the scientists’ dollar-each betting pool to estimate the yield of the first atomic bomb, which turned out to be 20,000 tons. Oppenheimer’s mystical inclinations and interest in Eastern religions always aroused his pragmatic friend’s disdain, but as Bird and Sherwin write, when it came to the morality of the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer “for once had no patience for the metaphysical.” As he wrote to Rabi, “To me it is primarily the development in time of war of a military weapon of some consequence.” The perspicacious Helen Newmark Rabi had known the more-sensitive-than-thou Oppenheimer since early childhood—they were classmates at New York’s private, progressive Ethical Culture School, where he enrolled in 1911—and considered him an insufferable poseur. Rabi held a more amused, though hardly uncritical, view of Oppenheimer’s high-flown airs. They first met in 1929, while both were pursuing postgraduate studies in Europe, and these fellow New York Jews took to each other right away despite their very different upbringings, temperaments, and worldviews. Rabi attributed their dissimilarities to class, his colleague having been, in his unsparing words, “a rich spoiled Jewish brat,” the eldest son of highly assimilated German Jews. The Oppenheimers’ full-floor apartment on Riverside Drive was hung with a Blue Period Picasso and three Van Gogh canvases, among other artworks, the opulent opposite of the two-room Lower East Side tenement flat where Rabi grew up in an impoverished Galician-Jewish family. For him, science was the universal equalizer of humankind, rather than the transcendental elevator of the spirit that Oppenheimer deemed it to be. Murphy has a following as the star of Peaky Blinders, the long-running Netflix crime-gang series set in post–World War I Britain. I found him convincing as the magnetic and maddening figure that Oppenheimer could be by turns, but my cousin Margaret felt that his tense posture was quite unlike her memory of Oppie in his prelapsarian heyday: a “completely relaxed, nonchalant English gentleman, always looking off to one side.” Murphy’s uncanny physical resemblance to the scientist has led The New York Times to dub him “The Man With Oppenheimer Eyes,” and his penetrating gaze does feel hauntingly similar to that of Alfred Eisenstaedt’s striking 1947 Life magazine portrait of the physicist wearing his signature broadbrim porkpie hat, a cigarette dangling from his lips. At times, though, Murphy so overdoes the extreme ocular distension that one wonders if he’s just in desperate need of some eyedrops. Less congruous with the original, in our family view, is the supporting role of Rabi, played by the menschy Krumholtz, who Margaret did not at first recognize was impersonating her father. Although similarly short—five-feet-six to Rabi’s five-feet-four—he’s much heavier than our compact and sturdily built relative ever was. And although the actor schvitzes too much at dramatic junctures, he does convey Rabi’s earthy directness and puckish vitality. At least the role didn’t go to Jonah Hill or Seth Rogen. (The casting is by John Papsidera, whose choice of Matt Damon to play Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, the Manhattan Project’s no-nonsense US Army overseer, was a masterstroke.) Further perusing the cast list, I discovered that several people I met through the Rabis are also represented, including their across-the-hall neighbor, the physicist Robert Serber (Michael Angarano), Oppenheimer’s chief deputy on the Manhattan Project, whom Rabi brought to Columbia after the war. The unassuming Serber was a unifying force at Los Alamos, where he led a series of colloquiums with the entire research team to bring them up to speed on how their individual contributions fit into the effort as a whole. Even if Nolan contemplated such a scene, Oppenheimer’s already overlong three-hour running time might have militated against it, and in the film Serber barely registers. Of the film’s two female leads, Oppenheimer’s lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is the more fully developed character. The role of Kitty, the aspiring biologist who married him as her fourth husband in 1940, is frustratingly two-dimensional, apart from her alcoholism, her neglectful parenting, and her rage at Oppenheimer’s passivity. Their volatile marriage baffled and disturbed even those closest to them, but little of her contradictory personality emerges in the script. Nonetheless, Blunt makes the most of what she’s given, especially during a government hearing scene in which she slyly makes one of Oppenheimer’s antagonists look like the idiot he is. Not having been inside a movie theater in more than three years because of the pandemic, I found Nolan’s pull-out-all-the-stops IMAX extravaganza an exhilarating reintroduction to cinema, stunningly realized by the sweeping cinematography of the Dutch-Swedish Hoyte van Hoytema. The bass-heavy audio mixing by Willie D. Burton seems more suited to the usual IMAX car chase fare than to a drama with many intimate scenes, in which dialogue is often covered by the thumping soundtrack. Understandably, the tour de force of the special effects team, led by Scott R. Fisher, was preordained to be the first atomic blast. Especially memorable is the delay between the detonation’s visual and sonic impact, the latter happening after a startlingly long interval, as thunder does with lightning. Elementary physics, but very effective. Oppenheimer makes an obvious attempt to exonerate its subject from the redbaiting allegations that ended his government career after the war. Unquestionably he was not a traitor, nor did he turn a blind eye to espionage at Los Alamos (although he might have unmasked a Soviet mole had he looked more closely at Klaus Fuchs, a visiting German-British scientist played by Christopher Denham in full sinister spy mode). And yet in stressing the way Oppenheimer was railroaded but downplaying his betrayal of former associates, the screenplay glosses over an essential part of his conundrum. The fact is that Oppenheimer was not the high-minded martyr of personal conscience—a modern-day Thomas More—that his legend would have us believe. Late and soon he craved establishment validation. This was evident in his postwar career as director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, the multidisciplinary think tank that he flippantly described to Time magazine as “an intellectual hotel.” There he gathered together a pantheon of younger physicists to surround the aged Einstein, who had arrived after fleeing Germany in 1933. “It was to prove unfortunate but true,” wrote the Dutch physicist Abraham Pais, an IAS faculty member, “that Robert relished belonging to America’s center of temporal power.” Oppenheimer’s precipitous fall from grace has been exhaustively discussed elsewhere, but it began with his reluctance to go along with the development of the even more destructive hydrogen bomb, once he began to harbor belated misgivings about weapons of mass destruction in the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When the Soviets tested their first atomic device in 1949, proponents of America’s burgeoning military industrial complex—especially Oppenheimer’s reptilian archnemesis, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, on which the physicist served as a consultant—saw the H-Bomb, then called “the Super,” as an imperative next-step deterrent. Viewing Oppenheimer’s resistance to the Super’s implementation as an inconvenient obstacle, the physicist’s enemies seized on his known dalliances with communism and Communists starting in the 1930s—which had not been judged serious enough to bar him from the Manhattan Project—as the easiest way to get rid of him. Here Oppenheimer’s downfall is posited as having begun with his public humiliation of the preening Strauss, whom the physicist once made look ridiculous at a Congressional hearing. Downey gives the film’s most riveting performance, a Shakespearean commingling of ambition, deceit, envy, and vengeance. After the ordeal, according to Bird and Sherwin, Oppenheimer told a childhood friend “that he had been a ‘damn fool’ and that he probably deserved what had happened to him.” Yet he refused to contest the verdict, giving rise to suspicions that on some level he wanted to be punished for his perceived misdeeds. During the proceedings he compounded those suspicions by naming names of suspected Communists to the very body that was unjustly purging him. He rationalized the betrayal by claiming he had originally concealed their identities to protect them. He thereby blighted the lives of several people—including a German refugee physicist, Bernard Peters, who had been in Dachau, and Haakon Chevalier (played by Jefferson Hall), a fellow Berkeley professor with whom he established the school’s branch of a teachers’ union before World War II. Oppenheimer even posthumously implicated Tatlock, a Communist psychiatrist whom he met in Berkeley in 1936 and who was, according to a mutual friend, his “truest love.” In 1944, a year after they resumed their affair during his marriage to Kitty, Tatlock committed suicide at twenty-nine. At the hearing he threw in for good measure the names of her friends who were Communists or fellow travelers. It was only because his security clearance was revoked at the end of the show trial that he is now seen principally as a victim of McCarthyism, and thus escaped obloquy akin to that heaped on the theater and film director Elia Kazan, who had informed on colleagues to the House Un-American Activities Committee two years earlier. Oppenheimer notes, in voice-over, the damage done by the physicist’s revelations, and we briefly see clips of his erstwhile friends wandering around absentmindedly, but that slighting acknowledgement seems almost offensive in its brevity. never got to be an integrated personality. It happens sometimes, with many people, but more frequently, perhaps, because of their situation, with brilliant Jewish people. With enormous capacities in every direction, it is hard to choose…. When he was riding high, he could be very arrogant. When things went against him, he could play the victim. Well after Oppenheimer’s death, the peerless Murray Kempton got to the heart of the matter in an Esquire article that provides a devastating summation of what was truly tragic about this perplexing though fascinating figure. “Government, not Krishna, and not even science, had turned out to be God for him,” Kempton wrote. “As there could be no disrupting a government’s decision to immolate Hiroshima, there could be no real disputing its decision to immolate him.” The architect Robert A. M. Stern is America’s most vociferous and successful exponent of a Classicism that would be considered anachronistic in much of the rest of the world.

"Jul 26, 2023"," **** At the start of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, raindrops fall; at the end, fire rages. You’ll feel it burn long after the end credits roll. Nolan has made violent movies before (including Inception and Dunkirk), but Oppenheimer is not just about physical devastation. It submerges you in the violence of a guilt-ravaged soul, leaving you feeling unsettled and unclean. Confronting the film’s moral and spiritual weight is a fearsome challenge, and one well worth rising to. With agitated charisma and vulnerability, Cillian Murphy embodies J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose mind birthed the atomic bomb. When we first meet him, he’s a curly-haired lad staring at a puddle, but he swiftly evolves into an excitable visionary leading a cadre of scientists into the deserts of New Mexico, where they will ultimately build and test a plutonium device (referred to as “the gadget”) on July 16, 1945. While Nolan exists a world apart from Oppenheimer—his creativity far exceeds his fascination with destruction—he has absorbed some of his subject’s frantic energy. Attempting to squeeze decades of a man’s intellectual and emotional life into a mere three hours, Nolan sometimes reduces moments to fragments, egged on by Ludwig Göransson’s eerie and pulsating score (which is excellent but overused). What saves the film from becoming a connect-the-dots biopic is Nolan’s ingenious chronicle of the post-World War II rivalry between Oppenheimer and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). The more Oppenheimer fights to put “the nuclear genie back in the bottle,” the more Strauss seethes and schemes, thrusting the movie into a maze of double-crosses that echo the exhilarating games of perception in Nolan’s 2001 breakout hit Memento. Of course, the thrill can’t (and shouldn’t) last. A decade ago, I applauded jubilantly as Nolan wrapped his Dark Knight trilogy, but Oppenheimer left me silent and still. As many as 226,000 people were killed when the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and they haunt the film like ghosts—especially when Oppenheimer imagines a charred corpse beneath his foot. A man dreamed; people died. All a work of art can do is evoke their absence. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

The end…at least according to the first few minutes of Barbie, a sleek and satirical fantasia from director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird, Little Women). Set in the utopian kingdom of Barbieland, the movie dramatizes the existential crises of the winkingly named Stereotypical Barbie. She’s played by Margot Robbie, who was last seen battling a rattlesnake in Damien Chazelle’s Babylon—and her misadventures in Barbie are hardly less bizarre. Plagued by flat feet, cellulite and fears of death, Barbie seeks the source of her ailments in the real world, bringing along a beamingly inadequate Ken (Ryan Gosling) with catastrophic consequences: Awed by images of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan, Ken becomes a crusading men’s rights activist, leading a revolt against the government of Barbieland and instituting bros-first martial law. And they say originality is dead! With its absurdist wit, glitzy musical numbers, and earnest ruminations on whether matriarchy and patriarchy can coexist, Barbie is easily one of the most brazen movies released by a major studio. Yes, its tidy ending betrays its anarchic spirit—after insisting that empowerment can’t be neatly packaged in a doll box, the film seems to say, “No, wait! It can!”—but it would be churlish to deny the charm of Gerwig’s buoyant creation. In an age when genuine cinematic joy is rare, we’re all lucky to be passengers in Barbie’s hot-pink plastic convertible. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

In black denim and gray New Balances, Leon (Thomas Schubert) is practically in uniform as someone who hates the beach. He’s destined to miss out, but the audience doesn’t. Petzold lets us enjoy Leon’s companions—his friend Felix (Langston Uibel), their unexpected housemate Nadja (Paula Beer) and a local lifeguard (Enno Trebs)—and Germany’s north coast. All the while, Leon frets over his manuscript, and a forest fire rages in the distance. Dreamy yet frustrated, blunt yet forgiving, Afire holds space for modern life’s many scales—a creative’s navel-gazing, less selfish characters’ acceptance of provincial life, existential dread. Reveling in Nadja’s beauty, intelligence and generosity (she’s always making goulash), Petzold keeps challenging the audience with Leon’s shaky grip on protagonist status. Often, this sour lump is the last character whose vantage point you’d want in this film, but that’s all part of Petzold’s ever-fascinating “both/and” filmmaking. People will still take meaningful vacations as the world burns; a bad writer can tell a good story; and Nadja will offer Leon a welcoming smile because they’ve shared a deeply imperfect moment. NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER.

As usual, daredevil secret agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is chasing after an explosive MacGuffin that he must protect from a doomsday-loving maniac (Esai Morales, in this case) lest the world go boom. Rather than vary the formula, McQuarrie simply refurbishes it (brilliantly) with fresh flourishes of suspense. You’ve seen Ethan race against the clock, but you’ve never seen him rushing through an airport in Abu Dhabi during a countdown to a nuclear explosion. You’ve seen him in one-on-one fights, but never with a demented French swordswoman (Pom Klementieff) in a terrifyingly cramped alley in Venice. You’ve seen him battle his adversaries on trains, but never run through one as it tumbles into…oh, just see the movie already, will you? Dead Reckoning Part One isn’t just cinema. It’s the essence of everything cinema was made for—not just triumphantly tense violence, but delicious glamour and sex appeal (a nighttime negotiation with Alanna Mitsopolis, a broker played with a lascivious grin by Vanessa Kirby, is nearly erotic enough to deserve an NC-17 rating). And while the apparent death of a main character strikes a sour note—these films work best when they’re disposable and delightful, not tragic and ruthless—I’m hopeful that it’s a red herring designed to goose our sympathies before Part Two arrives next year. It wouldn’t be the first time that a Mission: Impossible movie has manipulated its audience to irresistibly grand effect. PG-13. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Intentionally or not, she’s referring just as much to Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), her best friend and crush from before she immigrated from Seoul to Canada. Ever since, Hae Sung has reappeared to Nora like a 12-year comet, and in director Celine Song’s Past Lives, Hae Sung visits Nora in present-day Brooklyn. Both unambiguous romance and genre experiment, Past Lives sustains itself on love’s textures and musings: endless gazes, mirrorlike skyscrapers, a twinkling synth score (by Christopher Bear and Daniel Rossen), and a vibrant but melancholy obsession with New York City. Gorgeous 30-somethings who can’t keep guileless vulnerability off their faces, these characters aren’t looking to blow up their lives for the sake of movie contrivances, but through every private conversation, they’re drawn to discussing the same narrative possibilities on the audience’s minds. Who is the right lover in a story sense? Even Arthur wonders. Are in-yun and Nora’s brief, almost multiversal encounters with Hae Sung potent enough to alter the years in between? And when she glimpses the past in his kind, mournful eyes, is she dreaming or seeing? PG-13. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER.

Adopted Chinese American Audrey (Ashley Park) travels to her birth country for the first time, along with two eccentric best friends, Kat (Stephanie Hsu), a Chinese soap opera actor hiding her sexual past from her God-fearing virgin fiancé, and Lolo (Sherry Cola), a fledgling artist who makes playground models resembling genitalia to “get the conversation going” (Lolo also brings along her BTS-obsessed cousin, played by a wide-eyed, scene-stealing Sabrina Wu). Audrey’s business trip to China quickly turns into a cross-continental search for her birth mother, and the film sharply illustrates certain minority challenges—internalized shame, dissonance between internal and external perceptions of self. Yet its efforts to provide a comprehensive cultural education (the work of not one, but many, many more representative films) result in stilted dialogue and a hasty denouement. The comedy’s saving grace lies in its effectively over-the-top humor; filled with riotous bits and clever one-liners, Joy Ride promises to leave the audience feeling lighter than before they entered the theater. And, sometimes, that’s all we need from a movie. R. ROSE WONG. Eastport, Fox Tower. * A bickering couple on the brink of divorce gets stuck in a muddy hole in the forests of Colombia in Quicksand. Carolina Gaitan and Allan Hawco play Sofia and Josh, health care professionals who have journeyed to the country to assist a friend. After going on a hike and winding up in an area they were warned about, Sofia and Josh end up in a fight for their lives. The two have to put aside their differences in order to survive the ordeal, but Matt Pitts’ screenplay never rings true as it jumps from scene to scene. Quicksand could have worked as a survival scenario crossed with a therapy session, but the couple’s conflict feels underwritten and their inept decision making makes it hard to root for them. Director Andres Beltran tries to overcome the thin screenplay by overselling many scenes with music and style; many sequences are well shot, but the messy editing often betrays the images. Quicksand does provide some minor enjoyment with unintentional laughs (some involving a snake), but most of the time the film is alternately boring and annoying. NR. DANIEL RESTER. Shudder.

"Jul 26, 2023"," With a fervor for this man of dubious distinction, writer/director Christopher Nolan (Tenet, Dunkirk, The Dark Knight Trilogy) turns his immense, visionary talent towards an enigmatic scientist, whose quest had positives and negatives. It was all a blessing to President Truman (Gary Oldman, Darkest Hour). Horrific for the Japanese. A haunting curse on its mastermind that pushed him towards anti-war, anti-nuclear activism. A crusade that became a thorn to the U.S. government and even more so to Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., Chaplin), founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and Oppenheimer’s champion.  The Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin, was adapted by Nolan into a drama-heavy and character-laden script. A screenplay that corrals vital participants: General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon), the officer who drafted Oppenheimer into the project. The physicist’s lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a psychiatrist and card-carrying Communist. And his feisty biologist/botanist wife Kitty (Emily Blunt). She stood up for her husband as he was crucified during a sham, postwar investigation: “You sit there day after day letting them pick us apart. Why won’t you fight!” Nolan’s keen ability to direct films with the artistry of a gifted photographer is on display in just about every frame. The enhanced footage (cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, Dunkirk) is a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography and includes IMAX® black and white analogue photography. It’s impressive. Everything on view is edited (Jennifer Lame, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) gracefully and frenetically. Story. Backstory. Story. Backstory. Like a jigsaw puzzle assembled rhythmically and rained on by a steady stream of rousing music (Ludwig Gôransson) and jittery, thunderous sound effects. Enough to elevate the material into a heightened state of drama. A melodrama involving nuclear physicists, intellectuals, government officials, scandals, Commie baiting and political maleficence. It all crescendos as a crushed man and his supportive wife are led to the gallows by right-wingers, fair-weather friends and former colleagues.  The cast is a who’s who of frequently seen faces (Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh) and unfrequently seen faces (Bennie Safdie, Macon Blair, Emma Dumont). Why Pugh is doing nude scenes in a film that requires none is a mystery. Blunt makes Kitty the wife everyone wishes they had, minus the alcoholism. Murphy is stoic throughout. As enigmatic, assured and indomitable as he is vulnerable and passive. Awaiting a truth and justice that may not appear. Downey is the film’s MVP. Unrecognizable for the longest time. Especially in the black and white footage that seems culled from a 1950s Red Scare film where deceitful villains finger Communists and those they can falsely incriminate regardless.  Nolan’s Oppenheimer is being billed as a thriller. It is not. It is a bio/his/dra of the highest order. Meticulously crafted then developed over three hours. There’s the setup, the do-or-die build up to creating the world’s biggest blast and deadliest weapon. All that is well directed, acted and produced. But the film’s most explosive scenes come in the third act. When Oppenheimer’s achievements are negated as vipers descend. As he reassesses rights and wrongs. As fame turns into infamy for killing thousands of people and angering those who envied him.  This is a very heady, brainy spectacle. A thesis. A portrait of a genius, his triumphs and shame. The blood on his hands never let Oppenheimer forget what he did. And neither will this film.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023"," Leaving the theatre after seeing “Oppenheimer,” I was tempted to call it a movie-length Wikipedia article. But, after a look online, I realized I was giving Wikipedia too little credit—or Christopher Nolan, the movie’s writer and director, too much. A simple fact-heavy article about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist whose leadership of the Manhattan Project, during the Second World War, produced the atom bomb, turns out to offer more complexity and more enticing detail than Nolan’s script does. And it has more to say about the movie’s essential themes—the ironies and perils that arise when science, ambition, and political power mix—than the movie itself does. Nolan’s bio-pic, three hours long and based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography “American Prometheus,” charts the two main strands of Oppenheimer’s life: the scientific work that made his career and the leftist sympathies that, thanks to the country’s postwar anti-Communist crusade, were to prove his undoing. We meet Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) as a student making the grand tour of European science capitals, in the nineteen-twenties—Cambridge, Göttingen, Leiden—before returning to the United States and taking up joint appointments at Caltech and Berkeley. At Berkeley, he becomes a union organizer and donates to the anti-Fascist cause in the Spanish Civil War. (The money is conveyed via a Communist-affiliated group.) He hangs out with Communist Party members, including his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), also a physicist, and Frank’s wife, Jackie (Emma Dumont). Although not himself a Party member, he is spied on by the F.B.I. He meets a Communist medical student named Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and they begin an ill-fated relationship. In 1942, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who is in charge of the Army’s effort to develop a nuclear bomb, taps Oppenheimer to oversee the program. Political suspicion clouds Oppenheimer’s name, but Groves vouches for him. Now Oppenheimer’s scientific life and his political one collide. He proves himself a master not only of the scientific aspects of his assignment but also of its administrative and political dimensions. But, once the Red Scare takes hold, his eminence, his proximity to known Communists, and his postwar efforts to prevent a nuclear-arms race make him an easy target. (He was stripped of his security clearance in 1954.) The movie is structured as a sort of mosaic. Deftly edited by Jennifer Lame, it intercuts the various periods of Oppenheimer’s life—rise, struggle, fall, aftermath—continually connecting the early leftism and later pacifism with the tribulations during the McCarthy era. It’s natural to figure that such a fractured chronology would have a destabilizing effect—Nolan directed “Memento,” after all—but, in fact, the temporal scheme makes “Oppenheimer” less complex rather than more. The insistence on correlation means that events get reduced to their function within a larger morality tale. Nolan cuts his scenes to fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, and details that don’t fit—contradictions, subtleties, even little random peculiarities—get left out, and, with them, the feeling of experience, whether the protagonist’s or the viewer’s. What remains is a movie to be solved rather than lived. The crux of “Oppenheimer” is, of course, the tension between the abstractions of physics and the brutal exigencies of war, between the freewheeling researcher and the project manager pursuing worldly goals, between the man of principle and the man whose work is directly responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of Japanese lives. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish as well as a leftist, fervently devotes himself to the creation of an atomic bomb because he knows that Nazi Germany is far ahead in developing one and he assumes that Hitler won’t hesitate to use it. Once Germany surrenders—in May, 1945—he gets a shock: work on the bomb not only continues but accelerates. This mission drift poses a moral crisis for Oppenheimer that determines the course of the rest of the film, and of his life. It becomes clear that joining the Manhattan Project has left him tragically compromised, committed to creating a weapon of unparalleled destructiveness while having no say in how it will be used. Then again, the film is so intent on making Oppenheimer an icon of conflicted conscience that it pays little attention to his character over all. He was a renowned aesthete with a bearing so charismatic that his students would try to emulate it, but we get little more than a couple of artsy name-drops to suggest that he has any cultural life at all. The “overweening ambition” that Groves saw in Oppenheimer is never in evidence, nor is there any mention of his chilling readiness to go along with a plan (one that was never put into action) to poison German food supplies with radioactive strontium. There’s no glimpse of the ailing Oppenheimer, who was suffering from tuberculosis and joint pain even while running Los Alamos. It doesn’t help that Murphy portrays Oppenheimer as wraithlike and haunted, a cipher, a black hole of experience who bears his burdens blankly as he’s buffeted by his circumstances but gives off no energy of his own. The performance, no less than the script, reduces the protagonist to an abstraction created to be analyzed. “Oppenheimer” reveals itself to be, in essence, a History Channel movie. Detached from the rich particulars of personality and thought, the moral dilemmas and historical stakes that Oppenheimer faces are reduced to an interconnected set of trolley problems—with the historical context flattened to green-screen backgrounds. This moral reckoning is oddly underplayed in the dramatic action of the film, largely because of one specific aesthetic conceit of Nolan’s. After the bombing of Hiroshima, Oppenheimer is brought to speak to a raucously triumphal assembly of Los Alamos employees. His speech betrays no misgivings, but, while he’s at the podium, Nolan shows what Oppenheimer imagines: overwhelming flashes of destruction, conflagrations that burn his audience to cinders. Representing conscience in this way, wordlessly, enables Nolan to fill the screen with visual fizz, but it doesn’t convey the presence, the inner experience, of a true moral reckoning. That’s because images alone—at least, those which Nolan offers here—can’t suggest the interior debates that must be pulsing through such a conflicted mind at this ghastly moment. Perhaps, in a movie that told its story while ranging further into the realm of visual imagination, the decision would come off as an aesthetic commitment. But, given the plethora of dialogue in “Oppenheimer,” Nolan’s choice to convey Oppenheimer’s inner life solely in images comes off as merely a cinematic prejudice. In “Memento,” Nolan was sufficiently interested in his protagonist’s thoughts to let us hear them, as voice-over; all the more puzzling, then, that we are granted no such access to the inner monologue of someone as literate, reflective, and fascinating as Oppenheimer. Although the movie is unusually and even gratifyingly talky, moving most of its action ahead by way of dialogue, we almost never hear Oppenheimer speak about his guilt—not even in intimate discussions with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). The key moment in which he does verbalize misgivings is an encounter with Harry S. Truman, after the end of the war: Oppenheimer admits to feeling as if he has blood on his hands; Truman derisively offers him a handkerchief and then dismisses him as a “crybaby.” The scene is powerful, but its power is limited by Nolan’s failure to convey Oppenheimer’s opinion of the Commander-in-Chief who’d ordered the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The extended scenes of the closed-door security-committee hearing in which Oppenheimer’s political record and personal life are subjected to cruelly intrusive scrutiny come off as a scourging that he endures with a sense of self-punishment. Other scenes, of his persecutor Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), a Cabinet nominee, facing his own intrusive inquiries at a Senate committee hearing, evoke the Machiavellian realm of power into which Oppenheimer, naïvely confident in the wisdom of his mission, has ventured. Yet these notions, too, are unexplored from Oppenheimer’s own perspective. Rather than illuminating him or his times, the scenes seem pitched to spark post-screening debate, to seek an importance beyond the experiences and ideas of the characters. A hallmark of Nolan’s method—as in such auteur-defining big-budget works as “Inception” and “Interstellar”—is to take the complexities of science, turn them into sensationalist science fiction, and then reinfuse the result with brow-furrowing seriousness. The last step is often achieved by means of chronological or visual intricacies that render objectivity as deep subjective strangeness; strip away such effects, however, and one sees characters conceived in simplistically sentimental terms that are pure melodrama. In “Oppenheimer,” sentimentality and melodrama are in plentiful supply, but visuals less so, with the exception of Oppenheimer’s visions of conflagration. Even these are strangely subdued, generic images of churning fire standing in for the destructive power of atomic weapons—and it is tempting to imagine that Nolan is, in spite of himself, admitting to the incommensurability of cinematic representation for the historic catastrophe of nuclear devastation. For long stretches of the film, Nolan’s direction is a merely literal depiction of actors dispensing dialogue with efficiency but without flair; if his name weren’t attached, the direction might well be ascribed to a serial-television journeyman. What’s missing, above all, from Nolan’s connect-the-dots version of Oppenheimer’s life is the kind of utterly outlandish detail in which that life abounded. For instance, Nolan shows Oppenheimer, as a student at Cambridge, injecting potassium cyanide into an apple belonging to a professor who humiliates and punishes him for poor laboratory technique—apparently to no consequence. Later, Oppenheimer lets on, in a quick aside, that he was forced into psychoanalysis as a result. In fact, he was threatened with criminal charges and with expulsion, and only the pleas of his father, a prosperous businessman, spared him. In the movie, this reckless, potentially deadly whim comes out of nowhere, but there are plenty of other episodes in Oppenheimer’s life to suggest that a truly violent personality lurked within, as when he physically attacked a friend who announced plans to marry. Nolan shows Oppenheimer to be an eager class participant in his physics tour of Europe; in fact, he was an obnoxiously aggressive one, whose fellow-students signed a petition demanding that the professor silence him. Throughout his life, he was highly mercurial—expansive and sociable and whimsical when the occasion demanded it, as at Los Alamos, where he took a comic role in a play and was an enthusiastic party host.

"Jul 26, 2023"," Long before Little Boy and Fat Man were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, even before he first glimpsed his creation two weeks earlier at Trinity, J. Robert Oppenheimer was haunted by the bomb. Played by Cillian Murphy and written for the screen and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer opens with the theoretical physicist as a young student disturbed and haunted by abstract images of fire, destruction, and particles—a chaotic world existing just behind our own. It’s the reality hidden by the truth we choose to see, he tells his future wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). She is stuck in a loveless marriage. He’s involved in a one-sided affair. Neither wants to admit the truth behind the veneer they present. One of Oppenheimer’s more effective aspects is the myriad ways that idea plays out. When U.S. Col. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) comes to Oppenheimer to recruit him to manage the Manhattan Project, he comes with information that the Nazis are building the atomic bomb and must be stopped at all costs. By the time Oppenheimer delivers his bomb, Germany is in shambles, so the president drops it on Japan. Flashback to those prewar days, and Oppenheimer is a vocal opponent of fascism in Europe, primarily Franco in Spain. So he aligns himself, albeit briefly and somewhat tangentially, with the communist party. But by the time the war is over, fascism is no longer the threat—communism is. So it goes. Oppenheimer thought he was building a bomb to end the war, but all he did was start another one. And where Oppenheimer thought his enemies lay in wait in the armed services, he could not see the U.S. Atomic Energy Committee chairman, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), coming for him. A master of compressing and collapsing time, Nolan presents these periods—1939-45, 1954, and 1959—as one swiftly moving river of narrative, cutting back and forth without markers or titles, favoring tension above all else. It’s spectacularly successful, and one of the tricks Nolan pulls off is to make a three-hour story feel like a sprint instead of a marathon. A large part of that is thanks to the performances. Particularly Murphy’s depiction of Oppenheimer from a zealous young man who is so brilliant he can learn languages, lecture on quantum mechanics, publish papers, jet set from institution to institution while still finding time for illicit affairs, to the meticulously crafted image of the modern-day scientist complete with pork pie hat and pipe, to a man who—if not atoning for his part in the creation of atomic weapons—then at least grappling with the consequences he could not foresee and the one theoretical possibility he maybe shouldn’t have ignored. Oppenheimer is loaded with dozens upon dozens of players, with practically every speaking role played by a recognizable actor. It mostly works, but it also telegraphs too much. You know David Hill is going to play a larger role than the narrative wants to reveal simply because it’s Academy Award winner Rami Malek in the part. Oppenheimer is a big movie, but not big enough to serve them all, and one of the movie’s foibles is that some, particularly Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), feel more like window dressing than integral parts. Was it wrong to build the bomb? One of the numbers tossed out in the movie estimates the two bombs dropped on Japan resulted in 200,000 deaths. Does that number offset the number of U.S. and Japanese soldiers that would have died in a ground invasion? History seems to think so. But history also thinks the creation of the bomb was a Pandora’s box with no hope found at the bottom. From our vantage point in 2023, hope might take the position that what was unleashed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was so terrifying that it has not been used on an enemy target since—despite the fact that the world collectively holds enough nuclear weapons to destroy every last living life form, including bacteria, many times over. But Pandora is not the Greek myth Oppenheimer is going for. Instead, Nolan pulls on the threads of Prometheus—which authors Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin use for their book American Prometheus, the basis of Nolan’s movie—the god who brought fire to man and was tortured for the rest of eternity for it. Oppenheimer, the man who fathered unheralded destruction the world had not yet seen, can relate. But we do not chain our gods to rocks and command eagles to eat their livers. Instead, we put ours on the cover of Time, reward them with military contracts, applaud them on speaking tours, and quietly dismantle their entire life in backrooms and kangaroo courts. And then, after enough time has passed, we make movies about them.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023"," The end of the world is so passé. Try looking left or right these days without being confronted by it. Artificial intelligence, smouldering geopolitical tensions, a planet cooking – we are bombarded with reminders that not long after inventing the wheel, mankind seemed to make it its business to hasten the Doomsday Clock to within a whisker of midnight.  Today’s Hollywood history lesson takes us back to World War II and the birth of that capacity for mass self-annihilation. Far from everywhere, on a remote testing range in New Mexico, homo sapiens would test an apparatus with the potential to wipe itself off the map, along with much of the map too. And in the hands of Christopher Nolan, that lesson is a spectacular one. Oppenheimer (in case you missed the film’s $100m marketing budget) is a biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called “father of the atomic bomb”. It has long been in the sights of Nolan, a filmmaker always fascinated by the Venn diagram of science and emotion.  The writer-director does not merely tell of how the theoretical physicist oversaw the Manhattan Project while negotiating personal, moral and reputational dilemmas (the final third wades into the security hearings that severed his relationship with the US government). All that is here, and in fine style too, but there is something more at play – another strata thrums momentously beneath the surface. IMAX camera frames give off a seismic tremble. Stars implode. Ludwig Göransson’s score comes in stampedes. Oppenheimer is less a movie drama than a cinematic cathedral to our arrival at an existential precipice. And how did we get there? A tragic concoction of hubris, genius and one-upmanship. No wonder, then, that Nolan cast a man from Cork in the lead. Cillian Murphy, a regular on Nolan’s sets, locates another level of calmly mesmeric presence as the slight-framed boffin. Even just physically, the actor’s lantern-jawed profile and crystalline glare set him at a remove from everyone else in a cast packed with household names. It’d be glib to call this the part he was born to play, but it certainly feels like a culmination of the faith that Nolan has long placed in him.​ A heightened cognitive instinct for matter and energy, reaction and consequence, is introduced in a surging prologue shaped around the young Oppenheimer’s academic birth. The clumsy lab student is muddling through Cambridge when a tip-off by a visiting quantum physicist (Kenneth Branagh impersonating Christoph Waltz) points him at another tier of study in Germany. Teaching at Berkeley University, his social ties to the campus’s Communist Party – including a romance with party member Jean (Florence Pugh) and subsequent marriage to another former party member Kitty (Emily Blunt) put him on the radar of the FBI. It’s his brilliance, however, that sets Oppenheimer on a course with Matt Damon’s US Army engineer. The race is on to develop a weapon of mass destruction before the Nazis do, and Oppenheimer is the man to oversee it. In tandem with this is a post-war thread that charts the relationship with atomic energy chief Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). Strauss seeks to utilise Oppenheimer’s experience, only to fall out with the conflicted scientist and launch a vindictive campaign to revoke his security clearance. Alongside Nolan and Murphy, Downey Jr’s performance is the third interlocking screen component amid a remarkable ensemble cast (Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Tom Conti, Casey Affleck, et al). The timelines interweave around the centrepiece – that moment in Los Alamos when the big red button is pushed and the team cross fingers that theories and real-life reactions will chime rather than consume the planet in flames. Filmed almost entirely without digital augmentation, Nolan’s FX and sound design teams achieve here a rush of beauty and terror that is unforgettable.

"Jul 26, 2023"," So intense has been the publicity/advertising run-up to the Warner/Mattel candy-mobile Barbie that less wary members of its prospective audience may wonder what makes it worth the hype. What’s so special about a loud, energetic, ultra-colorful summer movie devoted to a plaything for girls (and of course, boys too) that’s been in toy stores since 1959?  Director Gerwig, co-writer Noah Baumbach, actor Margot Robbie, the film’s producers and platoons of flacks have devoted reams of copy and an avalanche of images to this particular product, clogging up the internet and media outlets so thoroughly that a visitor from another planet – a Barbie-free planet – might be convinced that nothing else taking place on Earth is half as important.  The significant factor that presumably separates Barbie from the similarly heavily merchandised antics of Marvel/DC comics super-heroes, Transformers, Toy Story holdovers, rubbery mega-monsters and horny hotrods is that the thing herself, Barbie, seems to be suffering from a crisis of confidence, a psychological/philosophical predicament. “What does it all mean?” wonders the insanely happy, gadget-and-wardrobe crazy, anatomically impossible, best-selling figurine.  Despite her never having to drink a glass of water or take a shower, a few cracks are starting to show in Barbie’s sunny, carefree demeanor. In common with thousands of fictional protagonists before her, the otherwise flawless blond (Robbie) is plagued by doubt. She even admits to herself a fear of death. None of the other inhabitants of Barbie Land offer our doll any remedy. The Barbies – they’re all named Barbie – still throng to the beach en masse and have a slumber party every night, and Ken (Ryan Gosling), the ur-type conspicuous-consumer male designated as “Barbie’s boyfriend,” is shrink-wrapped in harmless machismo. All his fantasies revolve around horses and a man cave called the Mojo Dojo Casa House, mostly because he and Barbie have never had sex. Barbie is left alone with only her insecurity to keep her company. On the way to her epiphany, though, Barbie discovers unexpected kindred spirits, among them harried mom Gloria (America Ferrara), Gloria’s wised-up teenage daughter (Ariana Greenblatt) and surprisingly, Ruth (Rhea Perlman), a character modeled on the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler. These grounded avatars awaken suppressed feelings – the suppression was designed into her by the Mattel CEO (a frothing Will Ferrell) – that surge to the surface in Barbie’s key dialogue scene. It’s a show-stopper, a rousing declaration of her humanity. But even that mission statement rings a little hollow in the face of the bumptious spectacle of life in Barbie Land. Barbie’s spiritual odyssey – featuring a few political barbs on the subject of equal rights – is a bit corny, especially when pasted into the gaudy explosion of plastic “fun” all around her. Gerwig fans would probably like to believe that if she really had her way, the frantic carnival would be dialed down to make room for Barbie’s “awakening,” which is very basic and personal.  Gerwig and Baumbach are intelligent creators. They’ll recover from this. And Mattel will most certainly move millions of units behind the manic spritz. But this film is not going to either reassure curious audiences about the facts of life, nor entertain casual viewers trying to connect the dots between Robbie’s live-wire sensuality and the apologetic tone of the movie’s denouement. Barbie was doomed from the start.  The story of J. Robert Oppenheimer is a fine excuse to study the workings of power in the U.S. Nuclear physicist Oppenheimer is generally credited with orchestrating the development of the first atomic bombs, which were deployed in air raids against Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan in 1945, killing some 220,000 men, women and children and effectively ending World War II. But how much more about the story does a movie audience want or need to know?  Christopher Nolan, director and co-writer of the drama Oppenheimer, opens the historical tale in the late stages of the war. The government is in a hurry to develop a nuclear weapon before the Nazi Germans do, and brilliant scientist Oppenheimer is drafted into the effort despite his apparent conflicting convictions. As a former communist sympathizer and a Jew, Oppenheimer — in a magnetic performance by Cillian Murphy – is already a question mark for the military brass and jingoistic politicians. But he’s still America’s foremost physicist, and he chooses Los Alamos, New Mexico as the headquarters of the new Manhattan Project for weapon development.  “Oppy” is a bit of a romantic dreamer in addition to being a genius. His love life is complicated – his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is weary of enduring the presence of the scientist’s longtime leftwing girlfriend, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – and his professional career is a minefield of academic argument and intellectual snobbery. Oppenheimer’s chief detractor is government think-tank wonk Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., almost unrecognizable in makeup), forever ready to challenge his rival’s leadership. And then there’s the task of getting a bunch of quirky, insecure eggheads to work as a team. The film’s hectic pace, goaded along by Ludwig Göransson’s penetrating string music score, keeps Nolan’s three-hour screen saga moving in high gear. It’s a pleasure to see a movie about intelligent people. In addition to the pressures of his national security task, nutty professor Oppenheimer has an inner dimension that’s as morally complicated as it is photogenic. In his quiet moments, which are many, his thoughts drift off into classic Hindu religious texts, particularly the Bhagavad-Gita, which he reads in the original Sanskrit. As his doubts multiply amid mounting political and military pressure, so do Oppenheimer’s moral qualms about unleashing the “destroyer of worlds.” In one especially frightful scene, he faces an auditorium of howling citizens overjoyed that “his” A-bomb has punished the Japanese. All he can think about is the loss of life, and the inescapable realization that he has let loose a terrible curse on humanity. The crowd is fixated on vengeance. Meanwhile, fake-jovial President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, always prepared to disappear into a character role) instantly recognizes that Oppenheimer is not his type of Cold Warrior – a commie peacenik who thinks too much.  Explicit in Oppenheimer’s point of view is the idea that heading off the threat of nuclear annihilation should be the prime determinant of America’s Cold War policy, an opinion decidedly not shared by the country’s leadership. And so Oppenheimer must pay the price for acquiescing to the hardball military-industrial playbook in the first place. His assigned role has its limits even when his conscience does not, and he is ultimately banished from the establishment amid the postwar Red Scare. Oppenheimer, a film energized by the life-and-death consequences the scientist deals with every day for years, is a bracing argument in favor of anti-war activism that paradoxically uses the bomb’s awesome firestorm as a spectacularly ironic punctuation mark. Nolan’s film is some degree of masterpiece.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023"," NOW IN THEATERS! A biopic like Oppenheimer allows viewers to take pause and understand how the human mind has powers that propel life and change the world forever. Sometimes once those powers are unleashed, there’s no going back. However, what we do going forward knowing from the past is worth considering. It takes a director like Christopher Nolan to deliver history in a manner that many people can understand or even better than they did previously with his vision and dedication to the subject. It’s the power of cinema that Nolan offers to tell the story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the father of the atomic bomb. The man is torn between his gift for understanding quantum physics, theoretical mathematics, and atomic energy versus the knowledge that his ideas could destroy humanity as we know it. Nolan artistically presents the conflict and humanity of Oppenheimer as a profound visionary, providing Murphy the ability to share the emotional sacrifice and stature of a mind and person with respect beyond the screen. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director draws upon the Greek myth of Prometheus to capture the mood of Oppenheimer. The structure supplies endless metaphors through visual effects, dialogue, character arcs, and sound. The crackling electricity provides a sense of the inner workings of a bomb and perhaps the cavernous and intricate mind of Oppenheimer. The filmmaker even manages to throw in the art and writing of the time that reveal changing philosophies, including T. S. Eliot’s The Waste Land and a Picasso painting. These asides offer insight into Oppenheimer’s need for transcendence in space juxtaposed with humanity’s need for catastrophic weapons. With the endless parade of characters who were all an integral part of the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Nolan makes sure each physicist, scientist, government official, and anyone connected to Oppenheimer is presented fully. He’s especially concerned with Jewish people, like Oppenheimer, due to the looming wrath of Hitler. Quite a few things are involved in the aptly named Trinity Test — three years, 4,000 people, and two billion dollars. This was ultimately followed by the ending of World War II with Japan when President Truman approved the atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, set for theatrical release July 21, tells the story of the creation of the atom bomb from the perspective of J. Robert... The Atomic Spawn, written and directed by Arthur Veenema, is set in 1952 on a nuclear bomb testing site. Under the command of Director Randal Pierce...

"Jul 26, 2023"," Christopher Nolan isn’t exactly known as a maker of talky films, but after the marriage of dialogue-driven action and his trademark epic spectacle in Oppenheimer, the label is one he should wear with pride. The writer/director’s highly charged biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer (masterfully played by Cillian Murphy) nimbly moves from the physicist’s college days to his professorial stint at UC Berkeley, capturing his insatiable quest for knowledge and natural leadership gifts, as well as certain character flaws that will presumably haunt him even beyond the 30-plus years Nolan depicts. Though interspersed with gorgeous scenery from the Oppenheimer family’s Los Alamos property in New Mexico, the film’s timeline is foremost propelled forward by a surprisingly chatty script, as if Nolan went on an Aaron Sorkin binge during the COVID-19 pandemic. The steady conversation sustains the film’s motion over the course of three hours, moving between a chronological account of Oppenheimer’s career and hearings concerning the renewal of his security clearance and the confirmation of adversary Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Tons of scientific, high-concept information is presented, but in far more digestible ways than its cousins in Interstellar and Tenet. And it also doesn’t hurt that the lines are delivered by a mammoth ensemble with more recognizable faces than the “Fishes” episode of The Bear. From the top scientists Robert recruits for the Los Alamos Laboratory sector of The Manhattan Project to the military brass he’s forced to navigate to the women he loves, big stars abound. And as is often the case in Nolan films, many household names are willing to accept subordinate roles for the sake of the greater good. While Downey (giving his best non-Tony Stark performance since Tropic Thunder) receives a true, meaty supporting role, and fellow poster-featured-names Emily Blunt (as Robert’s wife, Kitty), Matt Damon (as Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves), and Florence Pugh (as Robert’s troubled first wife, Jean Tatlock) make distinct impressions of their own, a potent mix of Oscar winners, comeback kids, and “That Guy/Gal”s keep the pace active in even smaller but no less significant ways. It’s not every film that brings Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman in for a couple of minutes apiece, asks Kenneth Branagh for his best Werner Herzog impression, and makes viewers wonder if Rami Malek is playing a mute. Nor will just any filmmaker trust Josh Hartnett, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Macon Blair, Matthew Modine, or Benny Safdie with significant dramatic heavy lifting. Nolan’s faith in each of these and other actors pays off, and his disinterest in playing by the rules extends to a climax that likely isn’t what many viewers are expecting, part of a tasteful restraint in which the filmmaker finds more creative ways to express Oppenheimer’s guilt at being the “father of the atomic bomb” than simple exploitation.",NEGATIVE

"Jul 26, 2023"," To look into Cillian Murphy’s eyes in Oppenheimer—in which he plays J. Robert Oppenheimer, who led the American development of the atomic bomb during World War II—is to look into the eyes of a terrified god. And the small “g” is intentional. This is the story of a man whose near-omnipotent intellect allowed him to hand humanity near-divine power—and then realize too late that we’re not meant to hold it. It’s no wonder then, that in this visually lush and dynamic picture—full of mesmerizing recreations of atomic reactions, courtesy of director Christopher Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema—one of the most arresting images is a close-up of a bright green apple resting on a desk. That apple, an allusion to the Garden of Eden, represents a moral dilemma (I won’t spoil exactly how) which stands in miniature for the massive moral question Oppenheimer considers: just because an atomic bomb can be developed, should it? Once Oppenheimer finds himself appointed to oversee the Manhattan Project by Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, sparking the proceedings with a nice bit of charisma), it takes longer than you would expect for worry to creep onto his visage. Oppenheimer throws himself into the scientific particulars, spurred by the knowledge that the Nazis are working to build their own bomb and waving away colleagues who begin to raise questions about the endgame of their efforts. And then they conduct their first successful test. Nolan and van Hoytema stage this as the world-shaking moment it is—a distorted mirror of Terrence Malick’s creation montage in The Tree of Life, in that this sequence captures the emergence of a force of dis-creation and death. Wisely letting Ludwig Goransson’s sublime, momentous score fall to the wayside, leaving only silence and Oppenheimer’s sucking breaths, the sequence centers mostly on two things: the awesome, awful consuming fire (recreated without computer-generated imagery) and Murphy’s astonished eyes. After the test, the moral question at the heart of the film settles heavily on Oppenheimer’s face and never leaves. If all of this sounds too straightforward for a Nolan picture—the puzzle maker who gave us Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Dunkirk, and other mind-benders—have no fear. Or, maybe you should. Nolan gives the movie a complicating framework: the Senate confirmation hearing of Oppenheimer rival Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who is being considered for the position of Secretary of Commerce in 1959. Part of Strauss’ own confirmation strategy involves revisiting his run-ins with Oppenheimer after World War II, which allows Nolan—who films these sections in black and white—to jump around in time, as well as employ a bit of sleight of hand with the hearing’s outcome (another gambit many of his films employ). While these scenes are of interest and do thematically connect to the story proper in certain ways (contrasting the pursuit of knowledge for knowledge’s sake and the pursuit of knowledge for the sake of power), the Strauss sections can’t help but feel of significantly less import than those involving the Manhattan Project. I could never get invested in Strauss’ fate—or even how it affects Oppenheimer’s post-war reputation. And this is a problem when the Strauss sections take up a considerable portion of the film’s three-hour running time. (Perhaps some of these scenes could have been swapped out for more with Pugh or Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife and is literally relegated to sitting in the corner of a room in a handful of scenes.) By the time Oppenheimer ends, it becomes more about the interpersonal problems of two miniscule men—miniscule, at least, against the backdrop of the cataclysmic, world-destroying questions and implications it had been exploring. When Murphy’s shaken Oppenheimer looks into the screen, it’s not Strauss I see in his eyes, but our own existential fears. I wish more of the movie had taken place there.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023"," There are two things that director Christopher Nolan loves more than anyone loves anything in the entire world: tortured male protagonists and dead wives. He had them, in various shapes and forms, in his Batman movies, in Inception and Interstellar, and even in Tenet and The Prestige. Annoyed as his core fanbase could be with his new film Oppenheimer, a pointed rejection of the genres that made him and then cemented his legend, they’d be pleased to note that both these tropes not only remain intact in the epic biographical drama, but have been magnified to a degree where they almost seem like an overcompensation. There is, however another recurring element in some of Nolan’s films — particularly Inception — that has intrigued and invigorated his admirers for many years. One of the more compelling interpretations of that 2010 classic suggested that it could be a metaphor for filmmaking itself, with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Cobb serving as the stand-in for Nolan, the director, and each supporting character representing department heads and crew members on a movie set. Tom Hardy’s Eames was the actor, Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s Arthur was the producer, and Elliot Page’s Ariadne the production designer. Now, more than a decade later, Nolan has returned with what might just be his most personal film yet; a film that overtly explores his anxieties, internal conflicts and struggles with trademark complexity and ambition. Starring Cillian Murphy as the American theoretical physicist best known as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, Oppenheimer is one of the decade’s most magnificent films, and the best Hollywood studio feature since Damien Chazelle’s Babylon last year. Watching it in IMAX is a unique sensory experience. Dense, dialogue-heavy scenes are more thrilling than most action movies, more is communicated by the lines on Murphy’s face than by the ones he’s reading off the page. The pulse-pounding Trinity test sequence, on the other hand, is so visceral that movie theatres might want to consider having a doctor on-site, in case an audience member or two faints out of sheer stress. But beneath the big screen bombast, there is a more personal, introspective story. By most accounts, Oppenheimer wasn’t politically inclined in his youth as a student of physics. It was only after he witnessed the rise of the Third Reich in Germany and the Civil War in Spain that he began taking an active interest in these matters. In an early scene, he seems unconvinced that his ‘abstract’ work could have any meaningful impact on the world. This is a dilemma that most artists and filmmakers could conceivably find themselves wrestling with, especially in times of great strife. What is the value of movies and books and music in this harsh world? Can it change mindsets, save lives? Nolan certainly seems to think so. He is also acutely aware of the flip side of this power; of how art, in the wrong hands, can be used to spread hate. But if there’s one sweeping statement that Oppenheimer makes, it’s this: propagandists are imminently disposable once they’ve outlived their use, regardless of their intellect and skill. Nolan most definitely isn’t kowtowing to autocrats, but he must certainly understand what it feels like to be at the mercy of corporate overlords who can launch petty attacks such as scheduling a movie against his magnum opus out of pure spite. Few people alive, however, take cinema as seriously as he does; during the film’s promotional tour (which itself could’ve made for a Nolan-esque ticking time bomb thriller set against the backdrop of a looming strike), the filmmaker needed no excuse to launch into an effusive soliloquy about IMAX film, irrespective of whether he was speaking to physicist Brian Cox or an upside-down Robert Downey Jr in a particularly playful mood. But in spite of the often overwhelming self-seriousness of his films, this is the first time that Nolan has equated himself with someone that he recently declared as ‘the most important person who ever lived’. As one character tells Oppenheimer in the movie, “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important!” The scenes in Los Alamos, where Oppenheimer begins to shape the Manhattan Project, can often feel like a behind-the-scenes making-of documentary that Nolan might commission for one of his own movies. Los Alamos is the set, the US government is the movie studio, the no-nonsense Lt General Leslie Groves (played by Matt Damon) is the producer whose entire job seems to be to keep Oppenheimer, and the ‘film’, on track. Oppenheimer is described as the ‘founder, mayor, and sheriff’ of Los Alamos, and his cult leader personality is alluded to on at least one occasion. Not only is he ‘directing’ the project, he is also managing various departments, resolving conflicts, and more than once, requesting Groves to allow his former communist brother Frank to join them. Nolan, of course, has collaborated with his brother Jonathan on several films, including the Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar. But did you know that he has a third brother with a supposedly sketchy past? Despite his ability to attract the world’s best talent both in front of and behind the camera — nobody else, for instance, could lure three Best Actor Oscar winners for single-scene cameos — Nolan remains an auteur. His movies feel like a personal expression, and not a committee-driven venture. And he brings some of that subjectivity to Oppenheimer as well. Because the movie is essentially a peek inside Oppenheimer’s mind, and not necessarily a traditional drama about the events he was involved in — often, Nolan’s camera is mere inches away from Murphy’s piercing blue eyes — the movie can’t be criticised for not offering a bird’s eye view of everything that happened. We don’t, for instance, see the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki because Oppenheimer didn’t see it either. If it seems like he wasn’t thinking about the consequences of his actions, it’s only because, at least for some time, he wasn’t. Like Nolan, who presumably isn’t visualising lines around the block to buy tickets to one of his movies when he’s directing a scene, Oppenheimer was dedicated completely to the job at hand. Contrary to convention, the movie doesn’t simply end after that thrilling Trinity test sequence — one of the best stretches of cinema you’re ever likely to experience in a movie theatre — but it proceeds towards an extended epilogue of sorts; a fifth act. Having already felt the first shivers of guilt during the test, Oppenheimer is utterly overwhelmed by remorse in the aftermath of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, when he has a vision of death and decay. This might be the closest that Nolan has come to directing a horror sequence since a couple of Scarecrow bits in Batman Begins, which, incidentally, also featured Murphy. But what unfolds next is more haunting than anything the film has shown us already. Oppenheimer is put through a deposition of sorts, in an effort to effectively silence him from voicing his strong opinions about the regulation of nuclear energy. He is targeted because of his vocal opposition to the government’s efforts to create a hydrogen bomb — a bigger ‘sequel’ of sorts to the warheads that he helped build in Los Alamos. Oppenheimer isn’t forced to sit through this humiliation, which sometimes takes a very literal form; he chooses it. We are often reminded that this isn’t a trial, and that Oppenheimer is being willfully mocked by a kangaroo court in proceedings that are revealed to have been orchestrated by the Salieri-esque Lewis Strauss (played by Downey). But he elects to face this punishment because he is guilty; this is penance for his sins. Nolan can probably relate, having himself introduced the world to the industry-altering era of superhero movies that we’re still surviving to this day. One can almost imagine him staring in awe at the final cut of The Dark Knight, and having a vision of the future, like Oppenheimer does of a world engulfed in flames. In his vision, he’s probably watching people line up for X-Men: Apocalypse, and whispering ominously under his breath, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Post Credits Scene is a column in which we dissect new releases every week, with particular focus on context, craft, and characters.

"Jul 26, 2023"," After watching the film twice, I estimate that the aforementioned administrative after-the-war muddle captures about 60 to 75 minutes of screentime, and this extended theme – indeed – grants a larger perspective of Oppenheimer.  However, ultimately, its inclusion feels like unneeded noise that bloats the runtime to three hours, where the last 50 minutes becomes a puzzling space of office infighting, backroom dealings, paperwork, and ambient lighting.  There is a method to Nolan’s madness, and he does close a loop introduced during the first act.  Debating Oppenheimer’s role in the upcoming atomic arms race – after the war - raises pacing issues and additional scope that feels better suited for a series.  How about a 6-hour, 6-episode series?  The pair also shift the on-screen events between color and black and white throughout the picture.  Quite frankly, it’s difficult to determine the reasoning, but the answer – that I found afterward - is online.  Still, I recommend watching the film without this knowledge and seeking it out after you leave the cinema.  Conversely, Nolan leaves less to the imagination when Jean and J. Robert engage in a couple of raw sex scenes, ones that solidify the film’s R-rating.  These moments may be new territory for a Nolan picture, but they demonstrate Oppenheimer’s more primal urges.  He was a flawed man with his infidelities, and these scenes pragmatically indicate his indiscretions rather than have the audience wonder with interpretations.  From an actor’s perspective, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Tom Conti, and Matt Damon (Groves) play vital parts in Oppenheimer’s career and in designing and constructing the Los Alamos facility and the bomb.  It leads to the infamous Trinity Test, which Nolan recreates on screen.  The 20-minute sequence, quite frankly, is the only reason to see this movie in the IMAX format, as the anxiety during the countdown and the detonation is a stressful horror show through the emotional anticipation, jump scares via wicked booms, and the frightening fireball awe.  Nolan and Murphy also deal with this invention’s destructive force and future implications that “will outlive the Nazis.”  After three years of mathematical, scientific, and engineering toil, the implausible goal is achieved, and our film director and lead display the dichotomy of Oppenheimer’s achievement as the Father of the Atomic Bomb while he also realizes that he’s “The Destroyer of Worlds.” The first two acts devote plenty of minutes to this subject.  Still, Robert Downey Jr. – inexplicably – seems to receive the most screentime during the movie’s last hour in a puzzling way to conclude an Oppenheimer biopic.  Eventually, Nolan gets to the point during the film’s final five minutes, but witnessing courtroom drama with Downey Jr., Jason Clarke, James D’Arcy, Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck, and more doesn’t seem the best use of anyone’s time, especially after Nolan churns our insides with stress during the Trinity Test.  Oppenheimer and his team are in a race to beat the Nazis to the bomb, but we never feel the stress of the contest.  Never.

"Jul 25, 2023"," There is one image that Oppenheimer, the new biopic about theoretical physicist and “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) returns to more than any other. It is not a mushroom cloud or a missile or the night sky full of stars—the initial scientific fascination which lead Oppenheimer towards a destiny one imagines he hardly could have anticipated in those early days. No, it’s an image of raindrops on water, concentric rings rippling outwards from points of impact. A detail of the every day, small and quiet and even tranquil. An image that gradually warps into something infinitely more sinister over the course of three hours as it takes on new connotations—concentric rings marking blast radii, shockwaves, the reach of radioactivity. In today’s ever more anxious and risk-averse Hollywood landscape, Christopher Nolan is one of an incredibly select group of filmmakers who can, in effect, make what he wants, precisely how he wants to, on the largest possible scale. Never before in his career has he flexed his powers quite so evidently as with Oppenheimer, in one sense his most restrained film since 2002’s Insomnia, in another his most daring film yet, paradoxically for the very same reason.  Nolan is a master popcorn filmmaker; a wizard of spectacle who makes big, loud films best viewed on the largest screen possible. A biopic is, traditionally, the antithesis of that—a star-studded but inevitably dusty, dull showcase of technical craftsmanship that one views primarily out of a sense of obligation in anticipation of awards season. And Oppenheimer is quite a talky film, particularly for Nolan. Of course, there is a very big bang central to the film, but the vast majority of the run time is spent in conference rooms and front parlors, in arguments over equations and logistics and security clearances, the scientific need for collaboration and transparency butting heads with the military-industrial complex’s demands for compartmentalization and secrecy.  Nolan’s well-evidenced love of non-linear storytelling comes in very handy here. His second collaboration with editor Jennifer Lame returns to the kind of complex yet clear temporal maze that make most of Nolan’s filmography such engagingly frenetic viewing save for the scrambled misstep that was Tenet. While the bulk of the action centers the three years in which Oppenheimer played a key role in the Manhattan Project as the first director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, overseeing the development of the atomic bomb, the film spans everything from Oppenheimer’s university days all the way to the later years of his career, jumping forwards and backwards in time throughout. The third act in particular actively tries to deconstruct the usual trappings of a “great man” biopic, focusing on efforts in the post-war years to discredit Oppenheimer after he became an outspoken critic of the US government’s continued expansion of the nuclear weapons program. To say Nolan is revolutionizing the biopic here would be vastly overstating things. He’s doing it bigger than anyone has before, certainly, but not quite better. If any filmmaker working today deserves that title it would be Pablo Larraín, the master of exploring the personal as political, who in recent years has made no less than three remarkably innovative biopics exploring the politically charged lives and legacies of 20th century icons with Neruda, Jackie, and Spencer. Nonetheless, Oppenheimer is a bold swing for Nolan. But as intriguing and commendable as it is to see him still pushing himself and expanding his horizons, the brilliant successes within the film are scattered with some marked stumbles.  Nolan is a masterclass director; there is no denying that he is top tier among working filmmakers when it comes to visual storytelling and a true master of spectacle. He’s not quite such an allstar when it comes to writing. As a writer, he is fundamentally competent, and even quite gifted when it comes to story structure and narrative in a big picture sense. Nolan’s kryptonite is in the details—in dialogue, and particularly dialogue related to intimacy.  He’s assembled an incredible cast who do much to cover his weaknesses on this front. Oppenheimer marks Cillian Murphy’s sixth collaboration with Nolan but his first time taking center stage. Previous projects have evidenced Murphy’s ability to do a lot with a little, particularly as an unnamed, mostly mute traumatized soldier in Dunkirk. He manages to similarly elevate the material through his performance here, and there is a lot more material to work with this time.  Murphy is a singularity of an actor whose career only ever grows more fascinating. He has remarkable range, but chameleonic is not the right term; he has never been the sort of performer to disappear into a role. With his distinctively piercing gaze and cutting jawline that fooled a generation of young British and Irish men into thinking they, too, could pull off a fade in the wake of Peaky Blinders, he might not be a household name in the US, but he’s a very recognizable face. No, Murphy does not disappear into roles; he does something more fascinating. He recreates incredibly different characters in his own image. He’s played trans women (in 2005, let’s set the discourse aside for a moment) and bumbling everymen and menacing crime bosses all while looking effectively the same. It’s the kind of performance that looks deceptively effortless, best appreciated without bells and whistles like heavy prosthetics. Never before has Murphy had such a major platform to display his abilities and he more than rises to the occasion. He pulls off a lot of heavy lifting in conveying Oppenheimer’s internal struggles through performance, particularly in places where the dialogue falls somewhat short, although there are limits.  The film attempts to explore Oppenheimer’s personal life to some degree; his womanizing and generally tumultuous love life, his politics, his Jewish identity, particularly in the context of Hitler and rampant antisemitism. But these are generally shallow and negligent explorations. While at no point in his life was Oppenheimer actively religious, the film gestures early and quite often at the notion of his Jewish identity being a significant motivator of his increasing political involvement while seeing antisemitism on the rise and engagement with the war effort. However, the film fails to ever even attempt to explore the idea of Jewishness, culturally or otherwise, besides experiencing antisemitism. However, the disappointments of the superficial explorations are perhaps still preferable to the alternative, in the places where Nolan really tries, as seen in the film’s efforts to depict Oppenheimer’s love life.  There is a surgical quality to Nolan’s films. Precise in a way that is one of his great strengths, but also sterile. A feature that, in many regards, doesn’t really present an issue until it comes to feelings—particularly intimate ones, and their inherently jagged, messy nature. It’s an Achilles heel that many commentators have picked up on in Nolan’s earlier films, but never before has he confronted the matter quite so directly. If this was a conscious attempt to silence naysayers, it could not have backfired more resoundingly. Florence Pugh bears the brunt of this failed experiment in the role of Jean Tatlock, a smart but troubled psychiatrist and Communist with whom Oppenheimer had a tumultuous romantic relationship that continued in some capacity well into his marriage to Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt). Pugh is a brilliant actress but there’s nothing to salvage here; most of the storyline involving her character feels like something that would have been much better left on the cutting room floor.  Of the supporting players, Robert Downey Jr. as Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss, the mastermind behind much of the post-war persecution of Oppenheimer, is a particular standout. It’s been almost a decade since audiences have seen him in a role besides Iron Man (no, I don’t want to talk about Dolittle, thanks), and the reminder of his considerable acting talents is more than welcome. Today’s Hollywood is effectively caught in a doom spiral of diminishing returns, with studios too anxious to take big swings releasing ever more tired regurgitations of overdone IP to tepid box office results that only inspire even more risk aversion. Oppenheimer is a refreshing outlier, stunning if severely imperfect; and, ironically enough for its subject matter and bleak outlook, a glimmer of hope. A glimmer of hope that there’s still a future for big, original movies in Hollywood. Maybe even a future in which filmmakers beyond Nolan, with different perspectives and skillsets but equally bold in their visions, are able to get such opportunities. There’s room still to dream.

"Jul 25, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly one of the most influential filmmakers of this century. His movies are regularly featured in articles about the best films of each year, of each decade, and even some of the best in the history of cinema. For me personally, he's a director whose name alone gets me into the theater every time. Nolan brought narrative complexity to blockbusters, transforming them into impactful stories that left viewers profoundly thinking about what they saw and what happened. The writer / director made audiences all around the world look at the theater experience as something more than an excuse to stuff themselves with popcorn. And he does it once again with Oppenheimer, his 12th feature film since Following in 1998. Nolan's last two movies, Dunkirk (2017) and Tenet (2020), were criticized – by a minority, admittedly – for being too confusing and difficult to follow. The first for its three distinct storylines occurring in the sky, the sea, and on the ground. The second for the visuals induced by the sci-fi premise of time going backwards. For these viewers, I don't think Oppenheimer is going to be any simpler or easier to follow. It's a narrative totally driven by extremely fast, intricate, scientific dialogue – tons of exposition about quantum physics & mechanics – and with rare moments of analogy explanations to help viewers grasp the most basic ideas. Oppenheimer is, technically, another masterwork that all film lovers should see in the biggest IMAX screen possible. A phenomenal lesson in how to assemble an incredibly immersive blockbuster with less than half the budget of all others. Nolan has always been known for his insistence on practical effects and shooting on film, something that shows tremendously in DP Hoyte van Hoytema's crystal-clear images and stunning cinematography. From the mesmerizing close-ups to the shifts between color and black-and-white, it's one of the most visually fascinating biopics I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Nevertheless, the technical standout must go to the sound production. Both the overall sound design and composer Ludwig Göransson's score transform Oppenheimer into more than just a movie. In the first few seconds, I could feel the ground shaking, my body vibrating, and my heart pounding. It's such a potent experience and so rarely felt in a theater that I'm afraid sensitive viewers may feel uncomfortable during some of the more…explosive…moments. It was one of the aspects that helped me maintain my focus on the story at hand and the respective character interactions. It's an extra layer that contributes exceptionally to the tension and suspense of each scene in an already remarkably atmospheric film. Nolan's Oppenheimer movie is divided into three acts quite clearly. The first follows scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) early career up until the moment he becomes director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where the Manhattan Project was orchestrated. During this period, the audience meets many scientists, colleagues and professors, who accompanied the growth of Oppenheimer as a theoretical physicist, as well as the women who were part of his life. Everyone – I repeat, everyone – has an essential impact on his life, whether by helping to set the path that led Oppenheimer to Los Alamos, building the first atomic bomb, or dealing with the traumatic aftermath. It's in this first hour, more or less, that Oppenheimer presents exactly the type of movie it will be. A quasi-documentary that doesn't waste time with irrelevant information or random conversations. Viewers can complain about the lack of interest or entertainment, but all the scenes have a purpose, so the 180-minute runtime is earned even if we feel its weight. The speed with which characters are introduced and with which, almost immediately, Oppenheimer advances in his career through new studies in different locations with other scientists and associates, is admittedly hard to follow initially. Watching this movie requires a certain adjustment not only with regards to the frantic pace of the scenes themselves but also regarding the fact that a post-bomb narrative is running simultaneously. As we follow Oppenheimer's scientific career, we also track the various ""trials"" about the makings of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" and the people who surrounded him over the years. Contrary to what many might think, the switch between color and black-and-white isn't necessarily related to time, rather to perspective: the former is subjective and almost always seen through the eyes of the protagonist, while the second is an objective, analytical lens examining the events that occurred. The second act goes through the study of and development of the atomic bomb, culminating in the seminal Trinity Test. This sequence is a masterclass in how to build extreme tension and suspense. In a very clever and exponentially more powerful manner, Nolan reminds the audience that sound waves reaching the nearby observers aren't instantaneous. An explosion at a certain distance implies that its sound only gets to us a few seconds later. Oppenheimer's climactic moment of truth makes viewers hold their breath during a countdown loaded with intense levels of tension… and continue to hold for a few more seconds, which will make the calmest person in the room quite uneasy. It's one of the year's most unforgettable sequences and it's brilliantly executed… but beware of unrealistic expectations. The constant talk surrounding the practical recreation of the atomic bomb without special effects generated much anticipation for a moment that should be important for its meaning, not its potential spectacle. Oppenheimer is a superb audio-visual experience, undoubtedly, but those who actually expect to *see* an atomic bomb detonating on the big screen in all its splendor and terrifying grandeur, without any optical obstructions or camera deviations, will inevitably end up disappointed. The Trinity Test is definitely Oppenheimer's climactic peak, but the third act is surprisingly as captivating, if not more than the rest of the movie. Nolan chooses to address the personal, political, military, and human consequences of the scientific discovery that changed, forever, how the ""new world"" looks at war. The moral dilemmas that haunt Oppenheimer for most of the runtime jump – quite literally – to reality and the movie truly becomes a terrifying horror story with sequences so harrowing, disturbing, and scary that it won't be easy to fall asleep the night after watching this. The final few minutes answer questions that had remained ambiguous before in a shocking manner, and Oppenheimer's deep character study is extended even further. Nolan explores to the fullest all the smallest details of his life and demonstrates, often through glimpses of the protagonist's imagination, everything that Oppenheimer thinks about his actions, as well as all the people who, in some way, impacted his life. This brings me to one of the reasons, if not the main reason why the film works so damn well: the cast. There are no words to describe how crucial the contributions of all the actors involved are to the audience's involvement in the narrative. Oppenheimer treats his characters like the real human beings they were, and the fact that A-listers, Oscar-winning actors show up for just a couple of minutes in a single scene with few lines is a testament to the movie's strive for authenticity and believably. Countless actors deserve endless praise, but I prefer to focus on the main ones, starting with Murphy. In addition to an accurately scrawny physical resemblance to the real Oppenheimer, the Irish actor represents the scientist's moral and ethical complexity with what is probably his career-best performance – a reminder that this is only his second leading role. For example, the chaos caused by the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is never explicitly seen. Nolan chooses to point the camera to the actor's face when witnessing photos of the horror experienced in Japan in August of 1945. Murphy manages to capture Oppenheimer's mixed emotions perfectly. On one hand, he was responsible for one of the most groundbreaking scientific discoveries in human history. On the other hand, he absolutely feels guilty for the death of thousands of innocent people in a war that, supposedly, was already over. His obsession is analyzed in excruciating detail by Nolan, and the dilemmas that marked his life also passed on to the intimate affairs with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Oppenheimer's events took place during a time when women lacked the respect, rights, and positions of power that, over time, have thankfully changed. Thus, Blunt and Pugh not only have limited screen time but often come across as vulnerable, dependent female characters. Kitty has an incredibly satisfying moment near the conclusion of the movie, but overall, both serve more to emphasize the dichotomy present in the main character's arc. Pugh is also shown nude in most of her scenes, taking part in some of the weirdest sequences in Nolan's filmography to date. Right at the same level as Murphy is Robert Downey Jr. appearing in the black-and-white scenes. After more than a decade of playing a superhero, it's refreshingly and genuinely fascinating to watch the actor take on the role of Lewis Strauss, a philanthropist who ultimately becomes the story's antagonist. Despite acknowledging we're talking about a biopic based on real events and with real people, I still prefer to avoid spoilers for viewers who aren't aware of the full account – and let's be honest, the vast majority of today's audience probably don't even recognize the name. That said, RDJ is absolutely fantastic and, like Murphy and Blunt, is unlikely to miss any awards ceremony. Matt Damon plays General Leslie Groves, the military man responsible for the Manhattan Project and recruiting Oppenheimer. The movie possesses rare moments of humor, virtually all of which come from Damon's performance, through sarcastic comments or ironic attitudes. Oppenheimer is packed with some of the most famous actors alive, so I don't really need to go around in circles. The bottom line is that everyone is brilliant in their own way in their allocated time. Aside from occasional problems with Oppenheimer's unrelenting pacing, as well as its non-linear narrative structure, there isn't much to pick on in such a well-crafted, well-written blockbuster. Jennifer Lame's editing is inherently linked to these less positive aspects, but it also contributes greatly to the engaging, intriguing development of the narrative over three hours. A lack of general knowledge about world history, as well as that of the United States of America and its decision making during the WWII era, can bring some complications for those who wish to follow the story without any misunderstandings. A final note for the outstanding makeup work. At a time when the use of artificial intelligence and de-aging technology is endlessly debated, Oppenheimer demonstrates that digital effects will never be able to beat the incomparable realism of practical effects and cinematic elements. The visualization of the characters is one of the most critical factors in distinguishing the various timelines. I also didn't notice the sound mixing issue that many complain about in Nolan flicks, but I admit that the fact that subtitles are always available (in the country where I'm watching movies) affects my perception of whether the dialogue is really being drowned out by the background sound or if it's just my non-native inability to understand everything that is said in the English language anyway. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a true masterclass in how to build extreme tension & suspense through fast, detailed dialogue, an insanely powerful sound production, and an equally explosive score from Ludwig Göransson. Words cannot fully describe Hoyte van Hoytema's gorgeous cinematography. It is a harrowing, disturbing, genuinely frightening story about how one man's compulsion and political power changed the world. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt shouldn't miss any awards ceremonies… they're absolutely superb, as are the rest of the exceptional actors involved in the movie. Pacing, structure, and runtime, in addition to its quasi-documentary style and its narrative complexity, make this a difficult, heavy watch that will, for sure, leave some viewers disappointed, bored, or simply tired. Ultimately, Oppenheimer justifies the use of the expression ""not for everyone"".",NEGATIVE

With every second of its 180-minute runtime carefully considered and masterfully constructed, Christopher Nolan's biopic of the man behind the atomic bomb is unmissable cinema.  Nolan adapted his screenplay from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and focuses specifically on the man's work leading to and throughout the Manhattan Project, and then the dismantling of his career and legacy in the years that followed.  Peaky Blinders actor Cillian Murphy would have to be odds-on favourite for next year's Oscar for his performance as the physicist who changed not only the course of the Second World War, but of world politics.  J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy) is a passionate intellectual in love with ideas, ideas learned at graduate school in England and Germany in the 1920s where he picked up several languages and interests like art and politics in addition to the emerging science of quantum mechanics which he introduces to American academia on his return.  When German scientists split the atom in 1938 and his Berkeley laboratory colleague Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) successfully repeats the experiment, Oppenheimer immediately visualises its possible use as a weapon.  However, with the war begun and the American military having started their secret weapons program code-named Manhattan, Oppenheimer's reputation for leftist ideologies and friendships within the American Communist Party means it takes some time for project lead Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to approach him.  His genius finally recognised, Oppenheimer convinces the military to establish a research facility close to his family property in New Mexico and allow him to recruit the pick of American intellectual talent, who work relentlessly towards the construction of a war-ending weapon.  Interspersed through this narrative is the hearing conducted by the US Atomic Energy Commission in 1954 investigating Oppenheimer's supposed Communist sympathies and his fitness to continue holding a security clearance, and other meetings engineered by UAEC chairman Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr).  It really is an all-star cast, with Murphy, Damon and Downey joined by Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh as, respectively, Oppenheimer's wife and mistress, but also with huge names in the smallest of roles, including the likes of Rami Malek, Gary Oldman and Kenneth Branagh in significant one-or-two scene appearances.  Every performance is controlled, with Blunt and Downey Jr best given the chance to show what they are capable of, but the film is Murphy's, all haunted sanpaku glare.  Nolan expects a lot from his audience, a decent level of understanding of many of the players and of the landscape of the Second World War, not spoon-feeding or overexplaining, and a mutual understanding at the horror Oppenheimer's bomb unleashed. This allows his narrative to remain focused on the Manhattan Project team's race to deliver, and the years-later fallout the moral weight of that work would have on careers and relationship.  The sound work in this film is as big a contributor to its success as the performances or direction. It is designed as an immersive experience and I'd strongly recommend doing a bit of leg-work to make sure the screen you book into has Xtreme Sound some cinemas advertise and is bigger than the shoebox I watched it in.  Ludwig Goransson's music, sometimes strings but always a merciless beat leading to crescendos and crashes, is augmented by stunning sound design work that makes us feel the pressure of a research project team driven by the weight of millions of deaths on the European and Pacific battlefields. The film opens with Oppenheimer's visions as a young man of such universal forces as the explosions within our sun, feeling like the esoteric final scenes of Nolan's Interstellar, but it then leaves this musing behind for the specific and human.  Nolan's screenplay jumps through time, slowly revealing his characters and their motivations, only making complete sense in its final moments, but with not a moment wasted.  At three hours, I was expecting to be sneaking glances at my watch having had my brain deplasticised over COVID, but I didn't feel the time dragging.  It's hard to articulate on opening day for both this film and Greta Gerwig's Barbie how both will be remembered, but at 10 in the morning I saw what looked like multiple booked-out cinemas, in numbers that put to bed the fiction that COVID killed the cinema experience.  I saw fans of all ages dressed in Barbie pink (and a few Kens), and plenty seemed to have bought into the online hype for a Barbenheimer double feature and came into my session of the Nolan film, and talked enthusiastically as the end credits rolled.

"Jul 25, 2023"," The primary visual stroke in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer isn’t, as you might expect, a wow 8K CGI rendering of atomic-fission heat-death but super close-ups of Cillian Murphy’s bony, glassy-eyed visage in the throes of one neurotic seizure or another. From his postgrad days at Cambridge to his last, persecuted post–Los Alamos guilt trips, Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb,” seems in a more or less constant state of tremulous dysphoria. Nolan means to get under this enigmatic figure’s sweaty skin, and to do it in peripheral IMAX and tympanic-cavity-sundering Dolby 5.1. So he gets close, often. It might be the longest and most expensive Hollywood movie dedicated to a real man’s neurotic anxiety. If only monster close-ups were by nature revelatory. Well, at least Nolan’s not out concocting yet another scientifically preposterous and incomprehensible “mind-bender,” but, rather, returning to the WWII era, where he so fabulously upended the brain-free summer movie paradigm with Dunkirk (2017). But Oppenheimer’s siring of the atom bomb is only half of the story Nolan wants to tell. The real intention of the film is to disinter a forgotten 20th-century episode of all-American skullduggery and write it back into history. David O. Russell attempted something similar with the 1933 Wall Street Putsch in last year’s Amsterdam; for Nolan, it is the Cold War–era ideological lynching of the leftist Oppenheimer, which effectively transformed him from a war hero and global figurehead into a pensioned nobody. Not, you’d think, the hot raw stuff of blockbusterousness. At first, I wondered how wonky the capriciously wonky Nolan would get with all that cutting-edge science, as opposed to the other Hollywood treatment of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, Roland Joffé’s prosaic Fat Man and Little Boy (1989). Joffé focused on supervising officer Col. Leslie Groves (played by Paul Newman; Nolan nabbed Matt Damon), and added in a fictional radiation poisoning on the site (suffered by young scientist John Cusack) in order to illustrate the lethality of what was happening. Nolan has no patience for such embroidery, nor for actual quantum mechanics and nuclear physics, which as always is relegated to math on a blackboard. The trajectory of Oppenheimer’s life is tracked in retrospect via two official interrogations: first, the closed-door investigation into Oppenheimer by a hand-picked Atomic Energy Commission board, in 1953–54, essentially accusing him of Communist leanings and espionage, and then AEC bigwig Lewis Strauss’s hearing in front of the Senate, trying to get his secretary of commerce nomination confirmed, five years later. (Strauss’s affiliation with Oppy made him suspect, at first. It’s a Wikimovie, no question.) In each case, the McCarthy-era hardliners dig through the minutest lefty aspects of Oppenheimer’s messy history, much of it draining down to what they keep calling “the Chevalier incident,” which was no more than a fellow Berkeley prof divulging to Oppy, during the war, that he knows a man who’d be willing to pass atomic secrets to the allied Soviets…. There’s a lot more detailed history than that to keep straight, and Nolan manages to get the whole mess into a lather. Still, relative to the later Red Scare intrigue, the middle hour, once Damon’s no-BS military ramrod shows up to get the atomic ball rolling, is a concise and exciting procedural about how to build a town in the desert (could the proximate release date of Asteroid City be a coincidence?) intended solely for the creation of a city-flattening weapon. Maybe Nolan’s primary achievement here is how little he explains — dozens of characters come and go in a torrential swirl, some famous but unidentified, and the director handles the sprawling company with verve. At three hours, the film has the elbow room to let actors find their prickly moments, in particular the redoubtable Florence Pugh (as an unstable Communist lover of Oppy’s), Casey Affleck (as a scarily quiet intelligence officer famous for torture), Benny Safdie (an inspired choice for Edward Teller, eventual father of the even more destructive hydrogen bomb), Gary Oldman (as a pandering President Truman), and, most of all Robert Downey Jr. as the duplicitous Strauss, handling the bulk of the film’s political exposition with a restless, imperious intelligence. In interviews, Nolan has called Oppenheimer “ambiguous,” and he is: You don’t know what to make of the guy, except as a brilliant somebody who allowed himself to be used and suckered and abused by history. He’s a mystery, and yet so much of the film — seemingly a full hour of its running time, added up — is devoted to cinematizing his inner turmoil, often with booming cosmic cutaways. Nolan’s thunderous Sturm und Drang never lets up, even after you realize that, for a postwar Oppy, the nerve-shredding stakes on hand are merely his security clearance and his role in the U.S. government’s atomic age development. (He was wealthy, and eventually retired to the Virgin Islands.) Oppenheimer never committed treason, of course, so you can be forgiven for wondering if the story warrants all this muscly filmmaking energy. You can practically smell the friction between Nolan’s Wagnerian ambition and the familiar biopic rulebook: the life boiled down to illustrative vignettes, the timeline hopscotch, the parachuting in of terrific actors impersonating real people for two or three scenes, and, most of all, the stubborn fact that most lives are not shaped like stories at all. Oppenheimer’s life had plenty of conflict — he seemed to have been tolerated by the powers that be despite his politics, his Jewishness, and his instability, until he wasn’t. But is that the same as a narrative? The sometimes repetitive stretch of Nolan’s film gives you plenty of time to think about it. (Incidentally, for those understandably maddened by Nolan’s history with what-the-fuck sound mixes, the dialogue in Oppenheimer is perfectly clear.) All the same, Nolan dresses to impress, and deserves a handshake for dedicating the equivalent of a small nation’s resources to reminding us, with so much detail and fidelity, how American power has so happily and so often eaten its own. Just as Nolan is a recalcitrant advocate for old-school celluloid and large-screen formats, we shouldn’t overlook how he’s tried to buck the summer-season teenage-wasteland devolution; for what it’s worth, Oppenheimer is by many calculations the first “big” summer studio film targeted to adult interests and attention spans since Dunkirk. Before that, you’d have to go back to Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven, in 1992. Nolan has blown the clarion, so now we’ll see if the Boomer-to-Millennial contingent will quit complaining, get off their sofas, and answer the call. I’d say step up, just so movies with this sort of deep-dish historical appetite have a chance of being made in America again.

Robert Oppenheimer, head of the Manhattan Project, which built the first nuclear weapon as a way to end World War II in the Pacific. The world changed on July 16, 1945 when the world’s first nuclear weapon was successfully detonated on a barren stretch of southern New Mexico desert called Jornada del Muerto. Called the Trinity Test, the explosion was so powerful and developed from such exotic materials there was a “near zero” chance it might ignite the earth’s atmosphere. Goodbye cruel world. Obviously, we’re still here, but the doorway through which humanity passed that day was the subject of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer’s worst nightmares, even while he pushed his team of hotshot scientists to develop a bomb to end all bombs in a secret city called Los Alamos near Santa Fe. And, after the devices Fat Man and Little Boy were eventually exploded over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing hundreds of thousands of civilians instantaneously and bringing an end to World War II, things got even more complicated. And, of that “near zero” chance the world might end? In some ways, as the subsequent arms race that spread nukes all over the world created not so much a deterrence, but rather a challenge to who might use one first, made the end something we’ve all had to live with since then. This is the canvas upon which director Christopher Nolan paints a picture of how things got to be this way through the eyes of the man who helped make it happen. Brilliantly portrayed by Irish actor Cillian Murphy, Nolan picks apart the fears and motivations, the lusts and temptations, and the doubts and fears that made up Oppenheimer’s complex personality. This highly refined intellectual landscape is one that few filmmakers have been able to tackle to the degree Nolan has attempted. Other than the jingoistic Paul Newman starring vehicle “Fat Man and Little Boy” (1989) and the lackluster soap opera “Manhattan” TV series (2014-15), little has been done cinematically to look hard at what happened in that desert and in the hastily constructed city of Los Alamos. Nolan’s film takes apart the truly monumental nature of what Oppenheimer’s international team of scientists faced. Not only was there an unprecedented achievement they were enlisted to fashion out of thin air — but the philosophical implications and humane responsibilities they faced have yet to be fully answered. Although it is essentially a biography, Nolan brings to bear the highly charged political climate of the era, a time when U.S. military and government officials saw Soviet Communists under every nook and cranny. Everyone, especially intellectuals, were suspect if they questioned the oppressive need for secrecy and if they failed to openly express absolute flag-waving patriotism. Things went worse for them if they lived private lives that didn’t meet the approval of Christian morality. Oppenheimer was no brainiac without a heart. In the film, though married, he maintains a relationship with a woman who was once a card-carrying communist but at the time of his affair she had left the party. Still, in later years, he and his wife conducted themselves as adults, maintaining their loyalties toward one another no matter the political and philosophical challenges they faced. That’s one of the themes that needs to be remembered in this movie. How can people think and behave like adults when all around are those in power who make snap judgements and assumptions and legislate laws as if herding bad children? Playing to this lowest common denominator may make for good poll numbers, but, as Nolan’s film points out, there are grander things at stake. This film, which runs for three hours, co-stars Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman, and Florence Pugh. Directed by Greta Gerwig and featuring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, the long awaited film based on the beloved Mattel set of playthings follows the adventures and inner journey of the doll first introduced in 1959 at the American Toy Fair in New York City. Today’s Barbie (Robbie) happily lives in a colorful ultra-perky Barbieland, that is until our heroine begins to worry about her existence. That’s when she is advised to visit the real world.

"Jul 25, 2023"," If Barbie offers the abrasive pink shock of the new, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is very much a throwback to the kind of high-quality, reflective period drama that cinema has previously been built on; it must be the most sober, serious-minded film to open with a nuclear $93 million weekend in the US. A big starry cast and Nolan’s studied style obviously help, but like Barbie, Oppenheimer takes a big name that you think you know and conjures a developed narrative that informs, educates and involves as it unpacks the backstory. It’s the kind of movie that often gets buried in awards seasons, but as a summer blockbuster, it’s an uncommonly literate and effective historical drama, adapted from the biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. For once, Nolan doesn’t fracture the narrative strands too much; framed by an investigation set in the 1950’s, we flash-back to see Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) recruited to the Manhattan Project after a formal scientific education establishes that he’s the best of his generation. But Oppenheimer is troubled from the get-go; we see him inject an apple with poison and leave it on the desk of his tutor, only to retrieve it before it can be eaten. In this instance, Oppenheimer is able to take back his mistake before any effect is caused, but he can’t help leave a deeper footprint in the Los Alamos desert sands as we get to understand the dog-eat-dog power struggles behind the genesis of the atomic bomb, leading to the first test at Trinity, and then the mass destruction of human life at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The film’s final act reveals a specific antagonist behind Oppenheimer’s fall from grace, but that identity should remain secret until you see the movie. The conclusion addresses the opening quote ‘Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.’ And Nolan and Murphy get us into Oppenheimer’s head as we see the creator of the atomic bomb haunted by horrors that reflect his responsibility for actions he cannot take back, chained to that rock forever and a day. If the women’s roles, adeptly played by Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, feel a little undernourished, that’s probably because men were the primary drivers of this narrative; Murphy does an excellent, un-showy turn as the scientist, with Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr and others all rising to the challenge of making history come alive, and Tom Conti a pleasingly gnomic Albert Einstein. The pyrotechnics are also handled in a careful manner; this is a story of technical success, but moral turpitude, and while the war was won, the personal cost is high for those who made the bomb as well as for those whose lives were destroyed by its detonation. Oppenheimer the movie isn’t an act of hero worship, but a fairly matter-of-fact look at his rise and fall from grace; the huge tragedies that he helped create are kept off-screen, a directorial choice to keep scope narrow and precise. Those who know their history will already know where Oppenheimer the movie is going, but there’s some fresh detail about how the witch-hunt of supposed communists led him to become a cropper, and there’s an aside about John F Kennedy (not seen here) that’s worth exploring. This kind of film can be caviar to the general, but slick marketing and the Barbenheimer effect have somehow brought Nolan’s film to the wide audience it deserves. There’s a lot of committee meetings, and a lot of white male angst, a lot of men in suits barking or following orders, but it’s all appropriate to telling an involved, compelling story that asks some serious questions about how weapons physically work, and how appropriate they are to be used in a world currently blighted by mass irresponsibility. How thrilling is it that we have two huge buzz-worthy movies opening in the same weekend (US at least) that aren’t Superhero movies, sequels, or remakes? It’s quite a different kettle of fish, but good all the same. Feels like there’s been a ketchup burst of enthusiasm for proper movies this week, and that’s all for the good. Got a Haunted Mansion/Grand Torino double header planned for next week, I’m sure they’ll be top notch cinema! And to think only a few months ago we neatly lost our minds due to Magic Mike Derangement Syndrome. Great! I think it’s a fresh development for Nolan, after the rather gimmicky Tenet, and like you, I’m keen to see where he goes next. Not Batman 4! Likely 1 of few that thought film should be longer or edited so it could include vital contributions of suicide squad [Parson, Melina, Forman) and over 50 women vital to launching nuc, Hornig, Char Serber, Joan Hinton, Liz Graves, Maria Mayer, Floy Lee, and woman Oppie outed as commie, name escapes me. Excellent critique and points raised! Did u watch earlier miniseries on Oppie in 80s? It was focused on heavy surveillance and mistrust, and FBI scrutiny post war. Yes! Meant to mention the miniseries, saw that on the BBC in the 80s and suspect Nolan saw it too. Nolan usually favours a more complex game than he plays here, but not much of his time was wasted; most of this lands, and I didn’t know about the apple. Will research the suicide squad, and also the female contribution; you always put me to shame with your incredible knowledge! Seen this twice already and will probably go back again. I loved it and for once wasn’t annoyed by Nolan’s time twists. Packed full of superb performances, Murphy obviously, and Damon, getting older gracefully, Hartnett (who I didn’t recognise), Blunt, Pugh. Although patriarchy was dominant Blunt and Pugh both had great scenes, Blunt when she tore apart the interrogator for his lack of phrasing, you don’t get much bolder than Pugh in the buff instead of those coy post-coital scenes with blankets drawn up to the chin, and I loved how she kept dumping his flowers in the bin. I never felt it was virtue-signalling, more that it reflected not even a fractured personality but a guy who went in his own eyes from hero to villain, basking in scientific glory to a madman’s what have I done. I could have sat through another 30 minutes so bring on the Director’s Cut. And what stroke of editing genius deciding to use the stamping feet as an integral part of the soundtrack from the start. I’ve ordered the book – currently sold out everywhere because nobody saw this success coming. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes. All images are copyrighted to their respective owners.

"Jul 25, 2023"," Well, there is still plenty of time to catch two of the biggest films of the decade so far in Greta Gerwig’s fantastical comedy Barbie and Christopher Nolan’s historical drama Oppenheimer. There’s also a really stunning Mission: Impossible film that’s still playing in theaters, one that sees Tom Cruise continuing to defy the laws of physics to entertain audiences. If we reworked our list of the 10 best movies of 2023 (so far), all three of these films would earn a spot. They’re all that good. This is an urgent, blistering work of fire-and-brimstone, as relentless and awing as anything Christopher Nolan has made in his career. It’s one of his best films, and I say that as someone who holds basically most all of his filmography as sacred ground. It’s a very sobering watch, as the film feels to tell us very bluntly our global demise is all but assured if we do not change our ways and hold our technological advancements at bay, lest we fall victim to them. It feels like a very direct commentary on the pending AI revolution, one that’s as uneasy and unforeseen as any we’ve ever undergone as a species. However, the film has no trouble reminding us that we’ve got plenty of doomsdays at our disposal already in case we’ve forgotten. Of course, Nolan nails the grandeur and terror of the Trinity test, one of the most accomplished sequences of his career. Cillian Murphy shoulders the three-hour tragedy in his gaze and his posture, a man who sees the end and still thinks he can get around it by walking straight into the calamity. It’s a gigantic performance, and he’s flanked by so many great supporting turns that it becomes hard to list all of them. Special kudos go to Robert Downey Jr., who finally sheds the iron and reminds us why he’s such a dangerous actor when given the right role and the perfect amount of space to roam in. Ludwig Göransson and Hoyte van Hoytema do expectedly brilliant work, but it’s Jennifer Lame who cements herself as a master editor with perhaps Nolan’s best-cut film since Inception. I didn’t ever think he’d be able to fully replace Lee Smith, but Lame is two-for-two after this and Tenet. It’s clear Nolan has a lot on his mind about what’s coming for us, matching a race-against-the-clock spectacle like Tenet with a real-world devastation like Oppenheimer. This is his finest hour as a filmmaker on a purely schematic level, as he’s operating in a space that few, if any, can at his level of the art. As an emotional journey, you’ll find yourself drained and hopeless, searching for a silver lining on a globe set ablaze by its own hubris. Oppenheimer saw it, Nolan saw it and now we see it in all of its horrifying glory. It’s the most vital use of 70MM IMAX so far of his career, showing us in full display how the bomb came to be and how its creators seem destined to repeat the failures of yesterday on a quest to claim tomorrow. Is there optimism here? I hope so, if only because all of Nolan’s films try to look for the light in some way. Maybe it’s that it’s not too late, that we can still tell stories that warn us of what came before us. Maybe it’s that we’re still here, and that the ultimate probability of the unstoppable chaos theory has yet to reach our doorstep. Maybe it’s because the world can’t fully end by human’s hand when so much progress is cut down by such petty governance before it’s too late, that our faults as a species keep us from ultimately succeeding to push that doomsday clock hand to midnight. All the same, this is a towering work. It will take another viewing to capture all the history in a bottle, to soak in the melancholy of Murphy’s astounding meltdown from paranoid promise to remorseful resignation. The majesty of the Trinity test fades so quickly to bureaucratic betrayal, as Oppenheimer’s willful ignorance in the name of vain discovery leads to a world bound captive by the waking nightmares of his troubled brilliance. This is a somber film, utterly rapt by its own destructions and spooked by its own rallying cry. It’s also one of the defining films of the century, and we’re not in a good spot if we don’t heed the warning of Oppenheimer’s story like gospel. This is a monumental achievement in filmmaking in so many ways, and my gosh, is that satisfying as a die-hard fan of Nolan’s. However, it’s also an earthquake of discomfort, one showing a world hurling to the brink of disaster if we don’t get our acts together and find ways to deal with what’s coming in the future. The great films are ones you can’t shake, and I’ll be haunted by this ending for the rest of my life. It’s such high praise and such cinematic beauty, but it doesn’t make going to sleep any easier. You have to be amazed that Mattel let Greta Gerwig get away with that, but blessings to the toy people for looking the other way. This is absolutely sensational, and anyone who can’t vibe with the sharp, empathetic commentary here has got to grow up. This really is one of the best IP films ever. Barbie is brilliant because it literally can’t exist without being a very specific movie about a very specific toy, and it does for Barbie what Phil Lord and Chris Miller did for Lego. If you take the right approach, you can make a great movie out of anything, apparently! It’s exhilarating that this is a mega blockbuster smash: this is everything most IP films aren’t. This will spark the toy-to-film wave, and I’m sure most of it will stink. I’m so glad this exists as it does though. It feels genuinely impossible to replicate. On one hand, this is as technically magnificent and full-stop entertaining as it’s been billed. Tom Cruise and Chris McQuarrie just have the visual language for these films perfected by now, as you can tell they both feel fierce devotion to pushing every single limit for what stunts won’t get Cruise in trouble if he attempts them. These films are just so precise now and genuinely stunning in their ability to ratchet up tension. I like to think Cruise and McQuarrie marathon a few Buster Keaton movies and North by Northwest before every shoot and just go to work, if only because they’re reaching for the same operatic heights of Alfred Hitchcock with the booming melodrama, the running-as-VFX and breathless imagination of the very realistic dangers that Ethan Hurt always gets out of every movie. These films need those event-level moments that get you excited about the possibilities of the medium, and this has those. It’s a tremendous example of why these movies work so well and why they don’t slow down. However, the Entity and all the AI paranoia smacks of 90s internet-age hand-wringing. AI is a deeply uncomfortable thing for a variety of reasons, but trying to hem so closely to the headlines takes away from the timelessness of these movies. The tech always ages, but going so hard in on the *now* feels a little forced. It’s not that social relevance is a hindrance to a villain, but the main bad guy in this is basically a lackey for a floating, sentient computer circle. It’s the same AI hook that’s been used for decades. There’s one pivotal standoff in Venice that’s supposed to communicate the gravity of the film’s threat, but it’s undermined intellectually by how… silly the idea of the Entity is. It’s a gimmicky way to try and provoke relevant fears, but it doesn’t fit a Mission: Impossible movie. Impossible is one thing, but implausible is another. However, it’s a testament to how great this movie is that such a ridiculous central hook can go down so easy because of the mastery behind the camera and the dedication Cruise puts into making these films as good as they can be. I don’t think he’s solely to thank for “saving movies,” but I do think he operates in a vital space where he can use his immeasurable clout to make cool stuff. That’s what we need him to do. Even if this film might play in 10 years like a Y2K thriller would’ve played in 1997, the set pieces will endure. With any other franchise, the Entity is a dealbreaker. With M:I, it’s background noise for the main attraction. I’ll remember the train sequence, the cliff jump, the airport run, the Fiat chase and the Eugene Kittridge of it all more than I’ll remember whatever the heck is going on with the evil McGuffin.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Dentro del fatídico año comercial que está teniendo la industria hollywoodense y el desalentador futuro cercano que obligará a replantearse muchos estrenos por la huelga de guionistas y actores, podía parecer descabellado, memes aparte, la existencia de un suceso como el ‘Barbenheimer’, el cual nacía más desde el instinto vengativo por parte de Warner Bros. hacia Christopher Nolan tras romper relaciones comerciales luego de Tenet (2020), que de una ecuánime decisión ejecutiva. Comprendía, sin embargo, que el retroceso ya sea de Warner con su Barbie o de la propia Universal con la primera película que produce del director británico como lo es Oppenheimer (2023), podían ser interpretados como malos indicios por la crítica y el público por lo que no se vislumbraba otra salida más que la convivencia de ambas cintas en la cartelera mundial durante las mismas fechas. La situación, finalmente, ha traído dos conclusiones positivas. La primera es que, conocidas las primeras cifras de la taquilla mundial, es gratificante que los espectadores no hayan tomado a ninguno de los títulos como una dicotomía polarizadora, sino como cine complementario que puede convivir y ser disfrutado de manera masiva. De aquí se desprende la segunda gran noticia y es que ha quedado demostrado empíricamente que solamente alguien con el nombre de Christopher Nolan en su espalda es capaz de llevar el tipo de cine que Oppenheimer propone a un público tan amplio y, particularmente, obtener un gran recibimiento. En este punto creo que el consenso está bastante claro. Oppenheimer no es una película sencilla de ver por varios motivos y me parece que el sendero para argumentar ello se debe empezar a trazar desde la explicación de cómo Nolan construye su largometraje. En la previa y casi como estrategia publicitaria, la cinta es un biopic sobre el hombre que construyó la bomba atómica. Conocido por todos, pero celebrado por nadie, el centro de la trama, evidentemente, es el físico nuclear J. Robert Oppenheimer, interpretado por Cillian Murphy, quien deberá ir abandonando su discreto estilo de vida en los próximos meses tras la nominación y casi segura victoria en los próximos Oscar. En una cinta en la que el diálogo abunda, Murphy dice tanto con la gesticulación contenida y la mirada profunda que no es necesario ir a buscar fotos del archivo para encontrar al personaje de la vida real, pues poco importa si la personificación es similar ya que la humanización de este es más que suficiente para presentarlo como un mártir, una figura con la que Christopher Nolan tiene predilección como ya lo hemos visto, por ejemplo, en su Batman: El caballero de la noche (2008) y en Interestelar (2014). En este punto es donde el también director de El gran truco (2006), que adaptó el guion de esta película del libro de Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin, American Prometheus, utiliza explícitamente el mito griego de Prometeo para asemejarlo al arco del protagonista y hacerlo navegar entre subgéneros dramáticos para desplegar todas las facetas que le conocemos. Por ello, aunque suene a cliché, es casi una obligatoriedad señalar que Oppenheimer es la cinta en la que Christopher Nolan es más Christopher Nolan que nunca. Ya mencionado lo del mártir como señal propia de sus roles protagónicos, además emplea aquí los saltos y devoluciones en el tiempo para contar hasta tres o cuatro historias distintas en las que el protagonista siempre es J. Robert Oppenheimer. Tengo ciertos reparos en esta característica del estilo de Nolan, pues aunque sabe como atar las ramas temporales sin problema alguno, en algunos casos como en su Dunquerque (2017), lo sentí innecesario sin que ello afectase notoriamente el resultado. En el caso de Oppenheimer, sin embargo, este recurso narrativo está perfectamente justificado.  En primer lugar porque resulta beneficioso para la construcción propia del personaje principal que recién logra completarse en la contundente frase final. En segundo lugar, porque le da una riqueza a la cinta en términos de registros. La línea que se presenta en blanco y negro que es en la que el Lewis Strauss de Robert Downey Jr. (dentro de algunos años voltearemos la cabeza atrás y nos daremos cuenta la bestialidad de actores que desfilaron por el Universo Cinematográfico de Marvel) toma relevancia es casi un diálogo en bloque con el resto de las líneas temporales que incluyen los años de juventud del físico y su cercanía con las ideas comunistas, convirtiéndolo en un drama político del estilo de Buenas noches, buena suerte (George Clooney, 2005), pero bastante más intrincado. Así también hace juego con el plato central que es el tiempo en el que el argumento transcurre en Los Álamos, lugar donde se hicieron los estudios y las pruebas de la bomba atómica y en el que la «farándula» científica convivió durante aquel tiempo. Este segmento, más allá del propio drama histórico que se plasma, desemboca en dos cuestiones innegables que dan cierre al segundo acto. La primera es que la puesta en escena de la prueba final de la bomba en pleno desierto en Nuevo México está rodada con un nivel de excelencia que va a quedar para la historia. Aunque dure unos cuantos minutos, el liderazgo técnico, otra característica inherente al estilo Nolan, que imprime el director para cada aspecto técnico involucrado en esta secuencia en particular genera una experiencia cinematográfica inverosímil, partiendo del hecho de que, fuera de la película, ya conocemos el desenlace. La segunda cuestión relevante es que esta escena da pase a un tono de épica existencialista en la trama que no era difícil de prever, pero no por ello es ejecutado con menos pericia a partir de escenas abstractas con similar perfección técnica y desde allí hacia la forma en la que Oppenheimer asume la condena moral que le toca atravesar, a pesar de voces externas, como la de su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt, correctísima siempre, ya sea en comedia, musical o drama), que le señalan que no le corresponde transitar aquellas complicaciones, pero ya, a esta altura, sabemos que esa es la particularidad de la figura de mártir que crea Nolan. Así como Cillian Murphy en esta cinta, son los personajes de Christian Bale en Batman o de Matthew McConaughey en Interestelar quienes se autoimponen la sentencia de sufrir por un bien mayor sobre el que finalmente no tienen la certeza de que valga la pena. Oppenheimer, entonces, es un drama que plantea un dilema sin respuesta -o muchas respuestas- al que se le podría reclamar que le faltan algunas aristas, pero para tal caso debemos contextualizar que el guion monta la cuestión existencialista desde el interior del protagonista y no necesariamente desde el pensamiento de tiempos actuales. Seguramente habrá más de uno que cuestione como una grave omisión el no haber considerado mostrar japoneses en ningún momento. Entiendo que ese argumento vendría de la tendencia de visibilizar a la víctima, pero Nolan tendría algún problema si accediese a ello. En primer lugar, había mencionado que durante unos años en Los Álamos convivió la «farándula» científica, pero creo que sería más preciso señalar que convivió la «nobleza» científica. En tal caso, y disculpen la descontextualización del siguiente ejemplo pero creo que se podría asemejar, cuando Sofia Coppola no consideró al pueblo francés dentro de la vida de su María Antonieta (2006) fue porque sencillamente para la protagonista no existía un contacto directo con este. De igual manera, no podría Christopher Nolan intervenir su guion para que la alta sociedad de ciencias estadounidenses tuviese cercanía o conocimiento del pueblo japonés en específico pues, para ellos, y especialmente para el propio Oppenheimer, su preocupación moral excedía el espacio y tiempo más inmediato, como su propia evolución en la trama lo plasma. Otorgarles rasgos físicos a las víctimas sería encoger el problema a un determinado momento en la historia, cuando la intención correcta es extender las consecuencias hasta la actualidad, objetivo que Nolan persigue y cumple. Habiendo tratado de diseccionar las complejidades de un guion que encuentro difícil de procesar, pero con el que Nolan coopera para poder mantener al espectador a flote, y habiendo elogiado la corrección técnica irreprochable del director, creo que aún me falta destacar lo que me parece la mejor cualidad de la película y debe ser en gran parte mérito del propio Christopher Nolan. Esto es, nada más y nada menos, que el cuantioso reparto que utiliza y al que presenta a tope de sus capacidades. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Ben Safdie, Rami Malek y Tom Conti, entre otros, son parte de un elenco que interviene esporádicamente pero que mantienen la cinta siempre en el mejor de sus momentos. Si bien hay materia prima para lograr grandes performances, sin un director de la talla de Nolan no sería posible que todo el reparto realice la mejor actuación de sus carreras en simultáneo. Y solo para terminar, disculpen la insistencia porque ya perdí la cuenta de cuantas veces lo mencioné pero es que podríamos resumir todo en que Oppenheimer es Nolan, Nolan y más Nolan.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Now that the opening weekend hysteria is over, let's be clear – Barbie and Oppenheimer are both fantastic movies but seeing them as a double bill (in whichever order) makes no sense. And no, there is no need to feel that one or the other is more suited to you. This is the modern day, we are all capable of enjoying many different things. Besides, (don't tell anyone) both movies are actually about existential crises at their hearts. Yes, you read that right. Both are undeniably incredible but you should enjoy them separately because each will linger with you long after you leave the cinema and you'll want to savour it. And yes, try and see Oppenheimer on an IMAX screen if you can, because director Christopher Nolan shot the movie for that uniquely immersive format and not an inch of the screen is wasted.  I saw it at a public screening. All ages and all demographics, and not a single empty seat. We sat in silent reverie for three hours and then spontaneously applauded at the end. Actually, one last tip for Oppenheimer... I was a little slow on the uptake at first, but the reason some of the film is in black and white is that these scenes are set in J Robert Oppenheimer's 'present day"" in 1954, when he was undergoing a politically motivated government investigation. The colour scenes are everything set before that, which is directly 'coloured' by his own subjective memory as he testifies and looks back on his life. These flashbacks are almost too perfect, Oppenheimer attributing everyone with glittering dialogue and diamond-sharp delivery. The cast is flawless, headed by a sensational Cillian Murphy in the title role (awards glory seems assured), Emily Blunt superb as his troubled wife Kitty and Florence Pugh as his even more troubled lover Jean Tatlock. Robert Downey Jr plays slippery politician Lewis Strauss, Matt Damon is military chief Lewis Groves, Tom Conti pops up as Einstein and the entire supporting cast is so ludicrously star-studded the likes of Rami Malek and Gary Oldman have scene-stealing cameos. Oppenheimer remains known as the man who gave the world (specifically the US military) the atomic bomb that conclusively ended World War II by forcing the Japanese surrender. It also started the nuclear arms race. Lauded in the US as the hero who ""brought our boys home"" he was already wracked with the fear that he was become Shiva, ""Destroyer of worlds."" Parallels in the film are also drawn with Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods to give to mankind, and was tortured for eternity as punishment. On-screen, the visceral and intellectual thrill of world-changing discoveries races us through Oppenheimer's youth and introduction to the heady world of American academia, where parties, wife-stealing, and liberal and communist activism abound. He is soon snapped up to head the Manhattan Project, which would ultimately cost $2billion, including building an entire town in New Mexico, Los Alamos, and stuffing it with some of the world's greatest minds to beat the Soviets and Nazis in the race to develop atomic weapons. Like all great minds, he wasn't always tolerant of those less able than himself, or (to his ultimate detriment) aware enough of politics and human ambitions and frailties.  Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema alternate between stark close-ups of faces, swirling golden images of atoms and sumptuous big screen panoramas as they pull us in and out of ideas, emotions and occasionally spectacular action. They expand to the profound and shrink to the most intimately personal. It is stunning to watch. The build-up to the first atomic bomb tests is almost unbearably tense and disturbingly beautiful. The bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima are never shown, but hang over the entire three hours. This is a powerful story of science and war, human achievement and human destructiveness, but it is the human relationships, betrayals, losses and loyalties that make the film come alive. In a year of box office flops, this is true cinema writ large, with ideas as big as the action and must be seen on the biggest screen possible.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Few filmmakers have captured a generation of moviegoers like Christopher Nolan. Emerging from a passionate indie scene, the director broke into the mainstream with his incredible Dark Knight Trilogy and The Prestige. The rest is history: one Oscar nomination for Best Director and several borderline masterpieces later, Nolan packs in fanboys like few other directors. After a very public breakup with WB over Tenet, his first film for Universal Studios results in some of the highest highs of his career. Oppenheimer, a biopic about the iconic physicist behind the Manhattan Project, showcases many of Nolan’s most experimental choices since Memento. Yet a divisive final act, a dissection of America, and the return of issues writing women rear their heads again.  Nolan employs a three-timeline structure once again, allowing the audience to bounce through the story in a mostly linear fashion. The primary section follows a young Robert J. Oppenheimer (a brilliant Cillian Murphy) who embraces monomania. He travels around the globe to learn from the best minds in theoretical physics. While at Berkley he meets open Communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and the two begin a torrid affair. However, Robert eventually settles down with divorcee Kitty Vissering (Emily Blunt). When World War II breaks out, Oppenheimer finds US General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) recruiting him to join the effort. They will overlook his checkered past with the Communist Party if he assembles a team to build a bomb before the Nazis.  The second timeline follows Oppenheimer’s appeal to retain his Q-level security clearance in 1954. In this timeline, Oppenheimer’s ties to the Communist Party are put under a microscope. The third black-and-white future explores Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) and his Salieri-like relationship with Oppenheimer during Strauss’ confirmation hearing in the Senate. During Strauss’ employment at the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the two men fought over the nuclear and atomic future policies of the United States.  In many ways, the expansive story that Nolan sets out to conquer requires every minute of its three-hour runtime. As a man, Oppenheimer signifies Nolan’s ideal “great man.” He is brilliant in all the ways that matter, he has a razor-sharp wit, and he maintains an obsessive focus on the small details. Oppenheimer chased what he felt was the most important work of his life until he grew to define it as something he hated. He did not stop to think if this course of action was right. He wants to rid his research of imperfection. Only testing in the real world can prove his theories. “Theory can only take you so far” becomes a refrain throughout the tale. In the end, he was willing to destroy the world to prove that he could finally quiet the visions in his mind.  Nolan and Murphy stunningly bring Oppenheimer to life in the best and worst ways. We see his callous disregard for others and willingness to compromise his values for whatever suits his fancy. Murphy plays the man with a gaunt frame and uneasy smile as someone who pretends to care about people. Yet, through his eyes, you can always tell his mind is elsewhere. He’s willing to burn bridges, publicly humiliate other scientists, and embarrass his wife without regard for their feelings. Murphy walks a tightrope for the audience, displaying Oppenheimer’s purely sociopathic tendencies with an overwhelming emotional fragility. All the while, Oppenheimer embraces American exceptionalist attitudes, not because he believes in the systems that empower him, but because they have empowered him to do whatever is necessary. It’s Murphy’s best work in years, and with Nolan adding unbelievable visual images around him, it’s impossible not to feel engaged.  While Murphy turns a black hole of a man into a compelling character study, Nolan goes to work. He literally bends light and science to his whims to craft stunning visuals. Hallucinations peer into the mind of our protagonist, and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema creates visual earthquakes around Murphy. With extreme close-ups and whip-fast dialogue, Nolan puts the audience in the middle of sparring conversations. Editor Jennifer Lame ensures we get hooked by the passion. Even discussions about deep scientific theory communicate the emotional power Nolan wants us to feel. Soon, Oppenheimer becomes much more than a biopic, but instead a question about the future of America.  In fact, American Exceptionalism and its place in the modern world seem top of mind for Nolan. For all the times America sought to play world police and maintain its moral superiority, those arguments became hazier after Nagasaki and Hiroshima.  Nolan makes Oppenheimer because of how close we’ve come to ending the world. Yet the imperfections in the story of America, created by Hiroshima and Nagasaki, began a national reckoning with the myth we created. We know other countries were working on these devices, but no one took the plunge until America proved it possible. Only in America could we roll the dice on the world’s destruction for a weapon to finish off a broken enemy.  Nolan interrogates the subject through Oppenheimer’s defiance of reason to complete the Manhattan Project after Germany falls. This leads to the incredible Trinity Test, the best sequence in any Nolan film. As Nolan showcases the pure power of the weapon in a stunning column of fire, the wind and rain beat down in the darkness. The force of the explosion hits the characters and audience with enough force to rattle your organs. Once again, Nolan’s experimentation with the power of sound feels unrivaled. That is, until a bomb is dropped. Oppenheimer proceeds to give a speech to a nightmarish crowd. Existence bends once more. That moment proves particularly hallucinatory and horrifying.  Yet as Oppenheimer begins to question its American values and ultimately decides the project has never been worth the cost, Nolan suddenly seems to lose his fastball. Over the last hour of the film, the director seems content with letting Oppenheimer wrestle with the quandary he created. However, this is where his traditional multi-timeline storytelling comes back to bite Nolan. We already know he lost his clearance (with several scenes questioning why the clearance was pulled in the Strauss timeline). We know that he feels guilty because the 1954 version of Oppenheimer appears broken. Instead, we relive characters explicitly stating their changing approach to politics, atomic weapons, and their lust for power.  Much has been made about Oppenheimer as a subjective work of art. By telling the story through Oppenheimer’s eyes, we see how the inquiry about his American patriotism hurts. The promises made to ignore his faults are broken. At the same time, he wrestles with the fact that he is the villain who brought about a weapon powerful enough to end it all. Yet Nolan does not take the final steps to fully understand the man.  On one hand, Nolan has Oppenheimer push back against his friends who question his wife’s ability to testify on his behalf. While he chastises them for trying to understand his relationship, Nolan leaves that footage on the cutting room floor. Oppenheimer’s subjective view of his own relationship is absent, and even if he only sees Kitty as a drunken, uncaring mother, we are supposed to believe his belief in her. Meanwhile, we are supposed to believe Pugh’s Tatlock is the love of his life, but within this subjective view, she’s degraded to little more than a sex doll. The subjective viewpoint argument falls by refusing to show the images of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Oppenheimer changes his mind about the weapons. He begins to push back on further tests from Edward Teller (an incredible Benny Safdie). He knows what these weapons are capable of. There is no moment in the film where this is more apparent than in a slide show.  These images remain unwanted by the general public. Yet, if we do not reckon with this destruction in the Oppenheimer movie, when will we? Right now, in my home state, the education system is trying to teach slavery in a positive light. Florida is not the only state attempting to install this kind of curriculum. Many of us fight back against disinformation, while others ignore the wrongs we have committed in the name of “freedom.” Many know these lessons, but the ones who need to see them most are not doing the research. An earth-shattering pop culture event like Oppenheimer is the opportunity to reach that audience.  That is American Exceptionalism, to ignore the past when we know better.  Nolan had a moment to remind generations of moviegoers about the horrors inflicted upon a nation on its knees. Instead, he had audiences watch a man squirm uncomfortably in his chair while trying to avoid the truth. It would have been uncomfortable, but it also would have been a teachable moment. It is not up to Nolan to fix the world with a single movie. Yet, he knows these images changed Oppenheimer’s ethics and view on life. Imagine what impact thirty seconds of the ten thousand seconds in this movie might have done on a global scale.  Most importantly, we would reckon with an image that changed this man. It was the evil that he unleashed that caused his change of heart. Without exploring those images and what they did to Oppenheimer the man, Oppenheimer the movie cannot fully tell his story.

"Jul 25, 2023"," Who would have thought a three-hour biopic (with thriller intent) about atomic physics would turn out to be 2023’s summer blockbuster? A blockbuster for adults. You’ll be on the edge of your seat the entire time because here, finally, is pithy, challenging, exciting, mind-expanding, engrossing, quality educational cinema at its best. The film opens with a reminder that the new-universe Greek gods punished Prometheus, a god from the previous universe, by chaining him to a rock for all eternity. He was sentenced to having his continually regrowing liver ripped out daily by birds of prey. Why? Because he’d given the forbidden gift of fire to humankind. Oppenheimer’s British professor scoffs at the suggestion, saying that Oppenheimer’s math isn’t up to par. Bohr counters by saying that math is to physics what reading music is to musicians—the important thing is to be able to hear the music in one’s head. Can Oppenheimer hear the music? He can. His research and reputation soon get him the job of heading up University of California–Berkeley’s theoretical physics program, where, as one of those geniuses whose brilliance is close to madness, his sanity is threatened by haunting astrophysicist visions of stars collapsing into black holes and the mind-boggling size of the cosmos. At the urging of his sometimes mistress (Florence Pugh), he also starts attending labor party meetings and taking a prolonged whiff of communism. The fruit of his labors eventually levels the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ending World War II, which begets Oppenheimer international fame, whereupon he seeks to turn his involvement into a platform urging nuclear armistice. The revoking of his security clearance as a U.S. Energy Commission adviser crushes his drive and activism. Inventing the atomic bomb and then campaigning against nuclear weapons appears to have been the all-time best example of trying to “close the barn door after the cow got out.” One imagines that had Oppenheimer been born later, he might have heeded “Jurassic Park” character Ian Malcolm’s warning: “Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.” But since it’s highly probable that that very line is based on Oppenheimer himself, that’s too much silly “Back to the Future” chicken-or-egg conjecture to contemplate. Based on Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s 2005 biography, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s film is basically a lot of procedural scenes containing brilliant-minded men talking, such as theoretical physicist Edward Teller (Bennie Safdie) and nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), and of course Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). Another related timeline involves, as mentioned, Oppenheimer’s 1954 security clearance hearing—a kangaroo court intended to railroad Oppenheimer—via a committee spearheaded by predatory special counsel Roger Robb (Jason Clarke). In a film featuring advanced math and theoretical sciences, most of the moviegoing public won’t understand the minutiae, but Nolan demonstrates that good storytelling trumps the details. I found “Oppenheimer” to ultimately underline with vehemence the philosophical concept that mind and matter are the same. Out of mere mathematical scribbles and hieroglyphs on paper, concerning things that the human eye cannot perceive let alone prove, evolved the titanic power to incinerate 199,000 humans. Thoughts are supremely powerful, and when they manifest tangibly in the world, like this, in forms such as beyond-deadly atomic and hydrogen bombs, it’s usually a sign that humans have somewhere along the line cast out the divine.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, Oppenheimer wouldn’t exist. Even those who aren’t familiar with the name J. Robert Oppenheimer are aware of what he oversaw in the dusty, makeshift town of Los Alamos, New Mexico, in the early 1940s. It was secretly called a gadget, and was created by a collaboration of the greatest scientific minds of the Allies during World War II. The result was the atomic bomb, and a mere month after its first and only test in the desert, President Truman authorized the United States military to drop bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer’s invention is often credited with ending the Second World War. The man behind this catastrophic leap in scientific understanding is the focus of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy plays the titular theoretical physicist in what is his finest role to date. Oppenheimer is a relentlessly paced, three-hour epic. Nolan rarely gives the audience a chance to breathe, and it’s Murphy’s precise, captivating performance that ties the film ever so neatly together. The movie begins in 1926, but as anyone who is familiar with Nolan’s work will tell you, time doesn’t move in a linear fashion. There are three main sections that the film returns to as a means of creating structure. The first is Oppenheimer’s time at Los Alamos during the development of the bomb, roughly 1942–1946. Next is his 1954 security hearing. Finally, the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) in 1959. Most of the 1959 confirmation hearing, as well as a few select other scenes, is presented in black and white, acting as an unbiased look at the historical events. The rest of the film is presented in color to denote Oppenheimer’s subjective reflection on his own life. In previous works by Nolan, the dialogue comes off stilted and sparse. It’s as if the words were written in a vacuum chamber, solely for promotional use in trailers. They lack an underlying sense of normalcy, the regular, mundane way people speak. Oppenheimer is confidently Nolan’s finest script. That’s not to say that all of his previous problems in terms of dialogue are fixed, but it is his most successful in terms of a cohesive, genuine script. Of course, any improvements Nolan has made in terms of his writing carry over only to the way he develops his male characters. It would be unrealistic to expect a film about the life of Oppenheimer to manage to cover every detail about the Manhattan Project and the people in Oppenheimer’s life. Even though the movie is three hours long, that’s still far too much of a burden to place on it. That being said, Oppenheimer presents two women in the titular physicist’s life: his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his ex-girlfriend Jean (Florence Pugh). Kitty is a biologist and an ex-Communist, while Jean maintains membership in the Communist party. Oppenheimer’s connections to the Communist party are heavily scrutinized post-World War II, so it would behoove the film to give these women some time. Even though neither is responsible for introducing Oppenheimer to Communism, they were still major influences in his life. Their main role in the movie was to be drunk and cry. Maybe that’s a tad reductive, but it’s not reflective of Blunt’s or Pugh’s performance. It’s just baffling that in a movie that runs for 180 minutes there wasn’t time to allow these women to bee seen as substantial parts of his life. Nolan paints Kitty and Jean broadly and emptily. A cursory scroll through her Wikipedia will tell you that Jean was a writer and reporter for the Western Worker, as well as a graduate of Stanford University Medical School. Kitty helped research cancer therapy and held a BA in botany. Visually and auditorily, Oppenheimer stands alone. It’s not simply the volume that gives the audience the feeling of experiencing the test of the atomic bomb, but the layers in the sound design. It’s like a rolling sound wave coming through the speakers, knocking audiences back in their chairs. Then, the blast itself. The blinding, overexposed light washes away everything. Nolan has never shied away from scale, and there are few things bigger than the effect of Los Alamos’ discovery on the world. In that regard, there is no working director who could capture the scope of its impact in the way Nolan did. It’s particularly haunting when Oppenheimer is finally allowed to be silent. Too much of the movie is filled with a score that overtakes the actors, but when the test bomb is dropped, all that’s left is Oppenheimer’s unsteady breathing. It’s that moment where everyone realizes what they have unleashed upon the world. The film ends with a conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). They question what comes next. What will the world do now that humanity has the ability to destroy itself? In many ways, we’re still asking that question. We live on a precipice of nuclear war with no more answers than Oppenheimer and Einstein had in the 1950s. Oppenheimer asks audiences to understand America’s Prometheus and reckon with the power he gave to an angry world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Este fin de semana llegan a sala las películas financieramente más importantes del año: Barbie, con su impresionante máquina de mercadotecnia, y Oppenheimer, con el nombre de Christopher Nolan al frente de ella. Ya sea por coincidencia, rivalidad o calculada estrategia de mercadotecnia, lo cierto es que el estreno simultáneo de Barbie y Oppenheimer no podría ser más armonioso: ambas películas son opuestos casi perfectos en todos los sentidos, al grado que incluso comparten un elemento fundacional al que refieren y hacen homenaje: el cine de Stanley Kubrick. El juego viral retaba al espectador: ¿cuál ver primero? La respuesta es en realidad irrelevante, toda vez que en la pregunta va explícito que se verán ambas, lo cual es justamente lo que espera un Hollywood mermado por los efectos de la pandemia y que ahora se debate con una huelga de actores y escritores que no ve fin próximo. Necesita que ambas cintas sean un éxito en taquilla. Iniciemos con la oscuridad. Basada en el libro ganador del Pulitzer “Prometeo Americano”, escrito por Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan entrega el primer estudio de personaje de su carrera y lo hace a gran escala. J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967) fue físico teórico, director del laboratorio Los Álamos y líder del infame Proyecto Manhattan, aquel cuyo objetivo era crear la primera bomba nuclear, destinada originalmente para detener a los nazis pero que terminó siendo un vulgar despliegue de poder en Hiroshima y Nagasaki. La cinta muestra el arco que vivió Oppenheimer (perfecto Cillian Murphy) desde ser un torpe estudiante de física, hasta convertirse el “padre de la bomba atómica”, para luego ser humillado por una cacería de brujas macartista a cargo de su rival, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). La película inicia como una biopic más, pero el último tercio de la película se convierte en un drama judicial que muestra la humillación a la que fue sometido Oppenheimer por temas políticos. Resulta que el hombre que le dio el poder del átomo a los Estados Unidos se convirtió en un ser incómodo para el gobierno de la nación más poderosa del orbe (y cuyo poder deben, en gran medida, al mismo Oppenheimer). Christopher Nolan apuesta por una edición vertiginosa (imposible no pensar en el JFK de Oliver Stone, 1991) que teje una narración fragmentada (similar a lo que hizo en Dunkirk, 2017, aunque aquí con mucha más eficacia) y que prácticamente no da respiro en las tres horas de duración de la película (tres densas horas, sin duda, pero nunca aburridas). Es justo el montaje lo que rescata a esta cinta de ser un la biopic ultraconvencional que algunos de sus diálogos dibujan: “¿Conoce al doctor Gödel?”, “Hola, soy Niels Bohr”. La cinta supondría una nueva etapa en la filmografía del director, toda vez que en esta ocasión no recurre a complicados gimmicks para llamar la atención: aquí no habrá una narración dentro de una narración dentro de otra (Inception), no contará la historia en orden inverso (Memento), ni tampoco dará vuelta atrás al tiempo (Tenet). Aquí si acaso el único truco es el cine mismo, filmar en celuloide, apostar por tres horas en un formato amplio, IMAX, que si bien no parece sumar demasiado, tampoco resulta para nada despreciable, sobre todo en las escenas donde la pantalla se llena de partículas, de rayos, de explosiones atómicas que poco a poco se volverán cada vez más destructivas. Nolan parece regresar a los terrenos de su mejor cinta: The Prestige (2006). De nueva cuenta tenemos a dos hombres enfrentados (Oppenheimer y Strauss), apasionados y dispuestos a todo con tal de cumplir su meta. El director no recurre a grandes despliegues técnicos para generar tensión, lo logra con simples conversaciones (el no-juicio, la reunión para decidir dónde tirar la bomba) y encuadres simples. ¿Héroe o villano? Nolan no cae en ese juego, no juzga a su personaje pero tampoco lo exenta del inevitable dilema moral: la necesidad casi orgánica de seguir adelante en nombre de la ciencia y las consecuencias que esto conlleva. El director tampoco recurre a la revictimización: no muestra jamás las escenas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki, confía en que el espectador es lo suficientemente inteligente para saber de aquellos horrores. Pero si la intensidad de las actuaciones y el enorme formato en que está filmada fuera poco, la película termina por ser absolutamente avasalladora gracias al diseño sonoro. Nolan recurre de nueva cuenta al músico de moda (el mismo del tema de The Mandalorian) Ludwig Göransson, quien si bien por momentos parece emular al otro compositor fetiche de director -Hans Zimmer- rápidamente encuentra su impronta para incluso arrebatar la narrativa al propio director y apoderarse tanto de la película como de nuestra atención. Oppenheimer es una cinta cuyos temas siguen siendo actuales y vigentes: la reacción en cadena no termina, y el horror ante un conflicto nuclear de carácter mundial sigue latente. Si hay algo que Nolan no sabe hacer es abordar personajes femeninos. En toda su filmografía las mujeres son personajes secundarios que sólo sirven de apoyo al personaje principal y nunca son beneficiarias de mayor tacto, desarrollo o un arco interesante. Por eso Barbie resulta el opuesto perfecto a Oppenheimer. Si aquella describe un mundo lúgubre dominado por las decisiones de hombres poderosísimos, en la fantasía feminista de Greta Gerwig (escrita por ella y su esposo, Noah Baumbach) son las mujeres quienes han tomado el control absoluto de todo (incluso de la economía) en la llamada Barbie Land. Como lo dice el eslogan, Barbie es quien ella quiera ser: abogada, premio Nobel, escritora, barrendera o presidenta de la nación. Este mundo fantástico sirve de inspiración para las niñas del mundo real, por lo que las Barbies creen que su contribución puso fin a los problemas del feminismo. Usted y yo sabemos que eso último no es verdad, y pronto la Barbie estereotípica (Margot Robbie, perfecta para el papel) también lo descubrirá. Luego de un episodio de crisis existencial (tiene pensamientos sobre la muerte y, lo peor, le empieza a salir celulitis), Barbie se verá obligada a viajar al mundo real y corroborar de propia mano si las Barbies acabaron con el machismo. Greta Gerwig hizo la tarea: su película está claramente inspirada por muchas cintas cuyas referencias no tiene empacho en mostrar. El cine de Kubrick, Bob Fosse, Tati y las Wachowski, los colores vivos de Les parapluies de Cherbourg (Demy, 1964) y la imagen de Catherine Deneuve, viejos musicales como Vaselina (1978) y cintas de culto como El Padrino (1972). Pero si la directora muestra un amplio bagaje cinéfilo, la cinta no puede escapar a dos películas que en este contexto resultan fundamentales: Toy Story (1995) y The Lego Movie (2014). ¿Puede una muñeca de piernas largas y silueta perfecta ser un ícono feminista?, ¿Acaso Barbie no ha contribuido al atraso del feminismo?, ¿No es su figura un estándar inalcanzable que genera frustración? El guion no elude estas preguntas (tan obvias como incómodas), al contrario, sobre estos temas construye la película y da respuesta a ellas mediante grandes dosis de humor y cine. Si, estamos ante una cinta divertidamente feminista y femenina, que no obstante la autoparodia (esos ejecutivos de Mattel), no deja de ser apenas y el manual básico del feminismo aprobado por al menos dos corporaciones que (como bien lo dice la película) son dirigidas por hombres. Por ello le resulta difícil a Greta alejarse de The Lego Movie, una comedia hilarante, llena también de referencias cinéfilas pero que jamás ocultó ni se avergonzó de su objetivo principal: vender juguetes. No que Barbie no sea un lavado de cara para Mattel y Warner, y claro que su objetivo es vender más juguetes, pero Greta Gerwig logra conciliar los intereses de las empresas con los de su propia filmografía: una que por supuesto tiene agenda feminista y femenina, que siempre apunta hacia las relaciones madre e hija y que aquí da a las mujeres la injerencia que no tienen en el mundo real. ¿Es autocomplaciente? Tal vez, ¿pero qué son la gran mayoría de películas de superhéroes o las sagas tipo Rápidos y Furiosos sino cintas autocomplacientes del superego masculino que se regodea en sus juegos infantiles? No veo problema en que en esta cinta las mujeres ganen, derroten al heteropatriarcado y expongan (aquel magnífico monólogo a lo Gone Girl, 2014, que seguramente será tachado de sermoneador pero que no por ello deja de ser revelador) la complejidad no solo de vivir en un mundo dominado por los hombres sino incluso a la expectativa misma que el feminismo le impone a la mujer. En todo caso la pregunta es: ¿qué sigue? Si bien Barbie resulta en una divertida comedia con temas feministas y mucha exposición de marca, no parece que el truco le pueda salir dos veces a Gerwig. El éxito rotundo que tendrá esta película obligará a una secuela, ¿puede Mattel convencernos dos veces de que su producto no ha retrasado el feminismo sino al contrario, lo ha empoderado? Francamente lo dudo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Oppenheimer es una leyenda de la física teórica, fue director ejecutivo del Proyecto Manhattan para desarrollar la bomba atómica y se convirtió en un ejemplo de la era McCarthy con su Comité de Actividades Antiamericanas. Una personalidad pintoresca en auge y caída, que también estaba dispuesta a cuestionarse a sí misma éticamente dentro del trabajo de su vida. La biografía de J. Robert Oppenheimer está profundamente ligada a la historia de Estados Unidos y al orden mundial en el que vivimos hoy. Es un recordatorio de los medios a los que recurre la gente cuando se siente comprometida con sus creencias. Pero si uno se sale de estos puntos de vista y los cuestiona, es rápidamente traicionado y denunciado por sus compañeros. El director británico Christopher Nolan más conocido por sus ampulosas experiencias cinematográficas, aborda la vida de Oppenheimer de forma visual y se fija en fases cruciales de su vida. Uno de los recursos narrativos favoritos de Nolan son los distintos niveles temporales que se cuentan en paralelo y se enriquecen mutuamente. En su Dunkirk (2017), tres tramas comienzan en distintos momentos del tiempo y chocan en el final. En Tenet (2020), juega con el tiempo de la película e incluso hace que el protagonista luche contra su yo del pasado. El tema del tiempo no está explícitamente representado en Oppeheimer - pero cabe suponer que al físico le habría encantado cambiar algunas cosas en su crónica - sino que, en este acontecimiento cinematográfico, el tiempo es una fuente de experiencia de la que la humanidad debería tomar nota urgentemente hoy en día. Porque desde la invención de la reacción atómica en cadena, el mundo está a sólo unos milímetros de convertirse en un planeta hostil con una resplandeciente oleada de bombas nucleares. Oppenheimer es una película versátil que, en el año de su estreno, es algo más que una advertencia con un signo de exclamación. En los años veinte, el mundo de la física es puesto patas arriba por el científico danés Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). La física cuántica es la respuesta teórica a multitud de preguntas sobre el universo. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) se da cuenta de ello mientras estudia en Gotinga. Lleva la teoría física más reciente a Berkeley, California, como profesor y reúne a su alrededor a científicos naturales cada vez más inteligentes conferencia tras conferencia. Oppenheimer disfruta plenamente de la vida en la universidad, gracias también a su romance con Jane Tatlock (Florence Pugh). En los años 30, las opiniones comunistas también están representadas en un gran número de intelectuales de Estados Unidos, al que también pertenece Oppenheimer. Pero tras el comienzo de la guerra y la división de Polonia entre el Reich alemán y la Unión Soviética, surgen dudas sobre las opiniones marxistas de Oppenheimer. La Segunda Guerra Mundial envuelve al mundo y Estados Unidos sólo ve una posibilidad de acabar rápidamente con ella, mediante el desarrollo de un arma tan poderosa que cualquiera que no la tenga deberá rendirse. El general Groves (Matt Damon) le propone a Oppenheimer este proyecto inicialmente secreto. Éste debe impulsar el desarrollo de la bomba atómica en el menor tiempo posible y entregarla al ejército estadounidense tras haberla probado con éxito: el Proyecto Manhattan. A mediados de la década de 1950, Oppenheimer es conocido en todo el mundo como el ´padre de la bomba atómica` y utiliza su influencia para evitar un arma aún más potente (bomba de fusión/bomba de hidrógeno) y una carrera armamentística nuclear con la Unión Soviética. Sin embargo, su autorización de seguridad es cuestionada por una comisión de investigación del fiscal Roger Robb (Jason Clarke). Son unos días embarazosos y difamatorios en la estrecha oficina. Sólo su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt) y su viejo amigo Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz) permanecen a su lado. En 1959, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) va a ser nombrado Secretario de Comercio por el Senado de los Estados Unidos, pero la audiencia no sale como deseaba, porque su pasado en la autoridad de la Energía Atómica fue de todo menos inobjetable desde el punto de vista legal. Cillian Murphy está hecho para interpretar al enjuto y bajo de peso Oppenheimer. Con un atuendo icónico (sombrero, traje cómodo y pipa) y unos ojos azul acero que lo saben todo, da vida a Oppenheimer;  a su lado, un reparto de Hollywood de la liga superior se representa hasta en las últimas filas. Cabe destacar el reparto de Benny Safdie, que interpreta a Edward Teller, una especie de prolongación sin conciencia de Oppenheimer. La base del guión de Christopher Nolan es la biografía de Oppenheimer escrita por Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin, que debería leerse no sólo por su Premio Pulitzer. Mediante escenas cortas, la película recorre a toda velocidad el desarrollo inicial de Oppenheimer. La manzana envenenada (en realidad, este ataque a su profesor casi le cuesta los estudios) no debe omitirse, pues es el primer indicio de una personalidad moralmente diversa. El porqué de esto se puede leer en la biografía. Oppenheimer da rápidos pasos hacia la prueba de la bomba atómica y aquí se revela la esencia de esta personalidad, pues no hay un bien o un mal claros. El énfasis en el guión de Nolan es sorprendente. La audiencia de seguridad de Oppeheimer habría sido un marco adecuado para los niveles temporales. Pero no, es la audiencia de Lewis Strauss la que une todo en blanco y negro.  Los dos primeros tercios de la película transcurren sin pausa hacia la prueba en Los Álamos. ""Trinity"" es el nombre de la primera explosión de una bomba atómica en la historia de la humanidad. Oppenheimer bautizó el lugar como ´Jornada del Muerto` por su extensión de 30 x 40 km. La explosión cinematográfica es bella y aterradora al mismo tiempo. Gracias al metraje IMAX® analógico y a las reacciones químicas y físicas fotografiadas sobre el material fílmico vivo, estas escenas revelan el nivel al que nunca se acercarán los efectos digitales. Con el agujero negro de Interstellar, Nolan ya proporcionó la mejor simulación visual de un descubrimiento en gran medida teórico, incluso en los círculos científicos. Todos estos recursos visuales crean en el espectador una sensación de la persona -científica independiente y librepensadora política- a la que la guerra lleva a algo que le cuesta perdonarse. Así que no es casualidad que en las escenas posteriores a la explosión, por muy brutas acústica y visualmente que sean, la euforia de la gente por un arma de destrucción masiva sea aún más aterradora. Oppenheimer se convierte repetidamente en un extra pasivo de su propia historia y, como sugiere brevemente su esposa, lucha demasiado poco por sí mismo. Cree demasiado en la sinceridad de su país, pero ésta se ve socavada por McCarthy, Truman y el director del FBI, Hoover. Es con el estómago hundido que uno se sienta con Robert Oppenheimer en las deliberaciones de Eisenhower sobre qué ciudades japonesas deberían ser utilizadas para probar una demostración de la fuerza nuclear americana, aunque Alemania ya había capitulado en este punto y el imperio japonés está haciendo los primeros indicios de conversaciones para la rendición. Pero está en juego algo más que la victoria, se trata del próximo adversario, la Unión Soviética. También hay que impresionarse. Durante la elaborada explosión de la película, queda claro que aquí se desata una energía difícil de controlar o devastadora si se comete un error. Por eso Oppenheimer aboga por el intercambio de información y el control o desarme de las armas nucleares. Sin embargo, amplios sectores del gobierno norteamericano ven en esta tecnología una ventaja para situarse de una vez por todas a la cabeza del mundo. Comienza la Guerra Fría. En la actual década de 2020, la Guerra Fría entre las grandes potencias políticas está de nuevo en pleno apogeo. Para Estados Unidos y sus aliados, no sólo Rusia es un adversario, sino también China por su rápido ascenso económico. Oppenheimer es, por tanto, un acontecimiento histórico que hace tomar conciencia una vez más de las diferencias actuales en la política mundial. Por no hablar de la denuncia de otras opiniones con la ayuda de las redes sociales. Pero Oppenheimer también trabaja en otro nivel de interpretación para la actualidad. Se supone que la inteligencia artificial salvará a la humanidad, promete ayudar, pero es indispensable saber qué peligros emanan de esta tecnología. Sólo en el sector militar, una potencia de cálculo superior es un avance bienvenido. Cuantos menos soldados se envíen a la guerra, menos resultarán heridos o muertos. Una consideración similar tiene lugar en Oppenheimer. Se dice que dos pruebas de enorme poder destructivo (Hiroshima y Nagasaki, con un número estimado de bajas de entre 90.000 y 166.000) impidieron la invasión de Japón por las fuerzas estadounidenses y una guerra mundial prolongada. Pero, como ya se ha dicho, Japón estaba dispuesto a negociar en aquel momento. Las grandes potencias actuales, Estados Unidos, Rusia y China, están llevando al extremo el desarrollo de la Inteligencia Artificial en sentido militar, mientras que en la guerra de Ucrania se agotan continuamente las reservas mundiales de munición con décadas de antigüedad. Pero, ¿qué ocurrirá cuando la guerra deje de estar en manos humanas y pase a manos de algoritmos eficientes? Sin duda, es más fácil dar una orden a una máquina que disparar a un ser humano. Además, en la naturaleza eficaz de las máquinas reside un riesgo aún mayor si se malinterpreta la información. ¿Puede un dron armado distinguir siempre un autobús escolar lleno de soldados de una furgoneta oxidada llena de fugitivos? Si Nolan se sale con la suya, el espectador ideal de Oppenheimer es alguien que aborda la historia de la película con poco o ningún conocimiento previo. En tres horas se cuenta al espectador, a veces en rápida sucesión, los estudios de Oppenheimer, su alistamiento en el Proyecto Manhattan, el desarrollo de la bomba atómica y la guerra de trincheras políticas que siguió. Todo ello con una obsesión por el detalle típica de Nolan, que a veces resulta muy cansina, pero que hace justicia a la complejidad del tema. Especialmente el aspecto científico, por ejemplo la discusión sobre los cálculos o las últimas cifras tras otra prueba, están escenificados de forma apasionante y son los primeros indicadores de que Nolan se está distanciando del cineasta de grandes películas para acercarse a uno que prefiere el juego de cámara dramatúrgica y actoralmente atractivo. Por supuesto, de vez en cuando se ruedan planos impresionantes, pero quien espere fuegos artificiales visuales como en Tenet se sentirá decepcionado. En cualquier caso, algo que el espectador se lleva de las tres horas de Oppenheimer es el aprecio por Cillian Murphy, que ofrece la mejor interpretación de su carrera como J. Robert Oppenheimer después de la serie Peaky Blinders. Especialmente en la primera parte, que muestra a Oppenheimer todavía como estudiante, el espectador se acerca a este hombre que ve un universo, o más bien tiene una visión del mundo, para la que aún no hay palabras, pero cuyo lenguaje pronto formulará. Los primeros planos, el temblor de la imagen y el sonido atronador dejan claro lo que sucede en el interior de este hombre, que se esconde una y otra vez tras una máscara impenetrable. Como es habitual en Nolan, Oppenheimer es también una interpretación de conjunto, con cada papel, por pequeño que sea, lleno de actores notables. Pero, en última instancia, ésta es la película de Murphy y, a pesar de todas las críticas que se le puedan hacer a Oppenheimer, sería una pena que no se reconociera este logro. La última parte de la película, tras el éxito de la primera prueba de la bomba atómica y el lanzamiento de una sobre Japón, es trágica y a veces muy dura. Se invierte mucho tiempo en las disputas políticas, los largos interrogatorios y las intrigas entre bastidores, en las que Lewis Strauss, interpretado por Robert Downey Jr., ocupa un lugar central. Se aborda el concepto de responsabilidad moral, así como la cuestión de hasta qué punto se puede renunciar a la investigación, siempre que al menos sea posible un uso militar de la misma. El hecho de que Nolan también considere esta parte de la biografía de Oppenheimer es interesante. Pero el relato, que ya no se basa en imágenes, resulta también muy agotador.

"Jul 24, 2023","  As a filmmaker, Christopher Nolan loves examining themes like morality, identity, and the destructive power of the human psyche. It makes sense that he'd tell a story about theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, whose life has largely been defined by his work on the Manhattan Project and iconic ""I am become Death"" quote. Oppenheimer explores the man behind that quote. The ambition and obsession that drove him, what it took to make the Atomic Bomb a reality and, how, for raising caution about the Atomic Age he created, Oppenheimer was punished by the government he built the bomb for in the first place.   Amazingly, Oppenheimer covers all this ground and more in what can confidently label itself the best Hollywood biopic in recent memory. A jaw-dropping character study, political thriller, and tragedy morphed into one, this is Nolan firing his 25-year legacy of movie making talent on all cylinders. It might also be his greatest blockbuster since Inception.   Split nonlinearly between Oppenheimer's (Cillian Murphy) activities leading up to, during, and after World War II, including the infamous 1954 security hearing accusing him of Communist ties, Oppenheimer is a detailed analysis of all this man wrought. How he rose in prominence during the physics boom of the early 20th century, leading to his affiliation with science's greatest minds from Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). His tenure at Berkeley alongside Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and endorsement of left-leaning political goals, resulting in a semi-affiliation with Communist groups despite never being a Party member. Working alongside Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) on the Manhattan Project to create an A-bomb before the Nazis, resulting in Los Alamos, New Mexico's testing ground conversion. A mission where the best of the Allied Powers' scientists worked in secret on a weapon that would change the course of history forever.   All these interactions reveal just what kind of person J. Robert Oppenheimer was. That is to say, very complicated. He was brilliant but deeply arrogant. Someone who had faith in his team's ability to build a nuclear fission weapon, but dismissed Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) interest in working on a hydrogen bomb, even after the war. A womanizer whose relationship with psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) continued long after his marriage to wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt) -- itself the result of an affair -- with tragic consequences. Someone convinced of his work being leak-proof, only for knowledge of Los Alamos to eventually fall into Soviet hands. Someone who, in these moments of arrogance and naïveté, created more adversaries than he wanted to admit.   Adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's book American Prometheus, Nolan -- who also wrote the movie's screenplay -- somehow condenses the highs and lows of Oppenheimer's life into a three-hour spectacle. The lone downside is how many characters there are and how longwinded it feels keeping track of them all. While a few big-name actors like Jason Clarke, Rami Malek, Alden Ehrenreich, and Casey Affleck get decent-sized supporting roles, others like Jack Quaid, Olivia Thrilby, Josh Peck, James D'Arcy, and Alex Wolff are stuck with what ultimately amounts to cameos. Filling in the background more than providing a strong monologue opposite Murphy, especially compared to how Wes Anderson utilized his A-list extras in Asteroid City just last month.   Everyone brings their A-game to Nolan's project. Murphy, with his piercing eyes and sunken cheekbones, is a captivating presence as Oppenheimer, effortlessly channeling the bravado, doubt, and grief of a man burdened by his creation when he realizes how other parties intended to use atomic weapons beyond World War II. The real secret weapon is Robert Downey Jr. as Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss. A colleague of Oppenheimer's -- whose Secretary of Commerce hearing mirrors Oppenheimer's aggressive security proceedings -- Downey initially portrays Strauss with the charm one might expect from his Marvel days, only to reveal an alarmingly bitter, vindictive side as the film morphs into a political thriller during its third act. One that exposes the hubris, folly, and outright pettiness of post-war American politics at the height of McCarthyism and how Oppenheimer got caught in the crossfire.   Even for those familiar with this historical era, Nolan’s direction ensures Oppenheimer retains a sense of palpable anxiety. His use of IMAX cameras, combined with Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography, gives each conversation a stunning, existential ambiance from beginning to end. As does Ludwig Göransson's score, amplifying the haunting nature surround the creation of, and reaction to, the bomb's power. A major point of Oppenheimer is just how far into the unknown its scientists were venturing. Converting theory into a destructive force no one thought possible, to the point that some feared detonating the Trinity test would ignite Earth's atmosphere and maybe destroy the world. An absurd claim, but given the Atomic Bomb's impact on the Cold War and present-day arms races, not that far-fetched.   In a way, this makes the moment where Oppenheimer finally detonates Trinity a moot point. Yes, the much-hyped Atomic Bomb scene is expertly-paced and beautifully haunting. But what ultimately makes Oppenheimer a stunning biopic is Nolan's interest in the bomb's fallout, both literally and politically. How Oppenheimer's concerns over humanity's post-bomb future put him at odds with the government, how his persecution divided the scientific community and how both, combined with the bomb's power, shaped his place on the world stage. It's all very Sorkin-like, but with a deeply melancholic outcome.   Much like Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's reputation as a director has always been a mix of well-deserved hype and frustration from those exasperated by said hype. Oppenheimer simply reminds us that Nolan's talent is genuine, and all but assures its status as one of 2023's best movies.  Tom Hanks has had many famous roles in dozens of iconic movies. But from Big to Toy Story, what are some of the best movies he's been in?",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," El presupuesto de una película no tiene nada que estar haciendo en el análisis de una película. No obstante, es imposible hablar del cine que produce Christopher Nolan actualmente e ignorar que es el único cineasta a quien «los grandes poderes» aún le otorgan esta clase de recursos para una cinta que no es secuela ni tiene personajes con nombres y vestuarios llamativos. Y es aún más imposible de ignorar cuando el mismo director se esfuerza tanto por llamar nuestra atención hacia su manufactura. En este sentido, su más reciente película Oppenheimer, no es diferente. Esa libertad presupuestal para cumplir todos sus impulsos de filmación práctica –notablemente, Nolan se niega a utilizar imágenes generadas por computadora– le han llevado a producir algunas de las secuencias más espectaculares y visualmente impactantes de la historia reciente. El espectáculo y los laberintos narrativos siempre han estado al centro de la obra del cineasta británico. Para contar la historia de la vida real de J Robert Oppenheimer –el físico que desarrolló la primera bomba nuclear–, la tarea de Nolan se complicó, pues al no tener la libertad de inventar sus propios giros y desenlaces, el espectáculo y el laberinto tendrían que venir de otro lado. En Oppenheimer, el espectáculo está en los rostros atormentados de sus personajes y el laberinto en la inestable perspectiva desde la que se cuenta la historia.  La narrativa de la película sigue, por un lado, a Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) y su trabajo como director del Laboratorio Nacional Los Alamos, el pueblo construido en el desierto de Nuevo México donde se desarrolló (y detonó) la bomba por primera vez. Toda esta sección, incluyendo su tumultuosa relación con su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt) y su amante (Florence Pugh) están filmadas a color y representan la visión subjetiva del científico. No sabemos si las cosas así sucedieron, pero así las vivió (o así supone Nolan que las vivió) él. Es posible que algunos espectadores se sientan decepcionados (si no es que cansados, tras sus tres horas de duración) con la falta de espectáculo tradicional veraniego y una historia que está más interesada en hacernos pensar y levantar preguntas que realmente seguir una trama como a las que nos han acostumbrado en el Hollywood comercial. No obstante, más allá de su cruzada por salvar la experiencia cinematográfica en una sala, hay que darle crédito a Nolan por intentar estirar sus habilidades como narrador.  Si algo se le ha criticado a lo largo de su carrera, es la superficialidad de sus personajes. Casi todos actúan como impulsores de la trama, como figuras creadas específicamente para recorrer el laberinto que el cineasta les creó. El ejemplo más claro lo tenemos en su cinta pasada, Tenet, en la cual al personaje de John David Washington ni siquiera se molestó en ponerle nombre. A diferencia de los personajes de sus películas anteriores, las motivaciones de Oppenheimer no responden a lo que la trama de la película necesita de él y en realidad éstas son constantemente un misterio. Por primera vez, Nolan se intenta acercar al estudio de personaje y dirige su fascinación por el espectáculo cinematográfico a las palabras y a los rostros de su elenco principal. Aunque las panóramicas impresionantes del desierto ahí están y la explosión al centro del filme es, sin lugar a dudas, una maravilla de presenciar, en realidad su interés estuvo en retratar las sutilezas del comportamiento humano en microscopio y proyectarlas a una escala apabullante.  Sin embargo, en términos del guion, el cineasta hace en realidad muy poco por acercarse a esa exploración. El peso y responsabilidad de este estudio de personaje cae entonces en Cillian Murphy. El irlandés hace una extraordinaria labor de retratar a alguien cuya mente y pensamientos le atormentan casi tanto como le inspiran. En general la película está poblada de algunos de los mejores actores y actrices que tiene Hollywood en este momento: Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh y Gary Oldman.  Todos saltaron gustosos a la oportunidad de trabar con uno de los mejores artesanos del cine actual. Incluso si el papel sólo requería una cuantas líneas de diálogo, como es el caso del ganador del Oscar, Rami Malek. Y sobre el rostro de cada uno de ellos -especialmente en la pantalla de 16 metros de altura de IMAX– recae la responsabilidad de hacernos adivinar qué es lo que les hace hacer lo que hacen.

"Jul 24, 2023"," With biopic Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan has made one of the most exciting movies of his career, and he's pulled it off despite a lack of traditional action/adventure sequences. It's a film in which 90 percent of the scenes consist of men in suits talking to each other, but Nolan finds a way to make it riveting. It's the director's best film since Inception in 2010. The three-hour film uses a complex structure, cutting back and forth among different time periods: Oppenheimer's stint as a college professor in the 1930s, his time leading the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos during the war, an interrogation of Oppenheimer by government agents during the Red Scare in the early-1950s, and a confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss in 1958. And in a counterintuitive move that works, the latest period in the chronology is the one that uses black-and-white photography. That Los Alamos sequence is the best in the film, using the Trinity Test as the climax, although there are strong moments in every other part as well. Oppenheimer is depicted as a brilliant scientist and mostly decent man, albeit one prone to occasional costly mistakes. The film states that he was attached to a few different left-wing causes—mostly out of hatred for the Nazis, who were slaughtering his fellow Jews—but never a spy or a full-on member of the Communist Party. He also began to have doubts about the morality of the nuclear project, even as he was received as a national hero. In adapting Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's 2005 biography American Prometheus, Nolan has cinematic inspirations, starting with Steven Spielberg's Munich, another film about a successful military operation that leads to a lot of guilt on the part of the guy in charge of it. It also recalls the historical epics Oliver Stone used to make in the 1990s like JFK and Nixon—a quickly-cut rampage through history, in which a 40-deep group of recognizable actors play all the real-life parts. And the film's best moment is a direct 2001: A Space Odyssey homage, after Nolan spent much of his Interstellar paying prior tribute to Stanley Kubrick. But there’s a lot that's pure Nolan, from the pulsating score by Ludwig Göransson, to a couple of key conversations that are introduced and pay off an hour later. And unlike Nolan's last few films, the sound mix isn't set up in such a way that the dialogue can't be easily heard. Cillian Murphy, a longtime Nolan hand who hasn't played a lead role in many years, is very good in the lead role of Robert Oppenheimer, who never gets lost in the shuffle of the massive cast. Robert Downey, Jr., meanwhile, does some of the best work of his career as Lewis Strauss, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission who had a complex relationship with Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt plays the third major role as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, who mostly maintains dignity despite being drunk in the majority of her scenes. It's a deep cast. Matt Damon is fine as General Leslie Groves, while Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, and Casey Affleck show up for brief but memorable scenes. Jason Clarke gives one of the movie's better turns as a lawyer interrogating Oppenheimer, while Florence Pugh plays Oppenheimer's Communist mistress, in a role that has her naked for more of her screen time than not. And Tom Conti has a couple of brief but wonderful scenes as Albert Einstein. The actor who shows up is Harry Truman, meanwhile, is a surprise way too good to spoil.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Barbenheimer is here, and there has been a lot of online chatter about which order you should see the movies, should you choose to see them both (and I say you should). It seems most agree you should start with the darkness of Oppenheimer and move on to the brightness of Barbie, but I'm not sure I agree.  I saw Barbie on a Monday night and Oppenheimer on a Tuesday night (one thing I will say: try to see Oppenheimer during the day, as it's three hours long, and the film's closing message may keep you up at night), and I was happy with that ordering. Both films are, in one way or another, cautionary tales, and some of the warnings expressed in the Barbie movie are fully executed in Oppenheimer, and that becomes more apparent if you see Oppenheimer with Barbie on your mind. And Barbie was definitely a movie I was still thinking about a day later. Greta Gerwig has created a garishly pink, girl-power fantasy packed to the gills with gags, music, fashion, dancing, and philosophical questions. There is so much happening in almost every scene of the movie it's impossible to catch everything on a single viewing. It's borderline chaotic, but if you've ever been a child who plays with Barbies, this tracks. Margot Robbie's ""stereotypical"" (as she deems herself) Barbie lives in Barbieland, a land essentially fueled by children playing in the real world. She wakes up everyday in her Dreamhouse, takes a dry shower, eats a fake breakfast, and floats into her pink convertible to drive to the beach. Almost every Barbie in Barbieland is known as Barbie (""Hi Barbie!""). The President; the Supreme Court; doctors; construction workers. And almost all of the men are Kens (except for Allan, who is hilariously played by Michael Cera), and they spend their day doing their job, which is...""Beach."" Stereotypical Barbie's Ken is played by Ryan Gosling, and I cannot think of more perfect casting. (Of course Robbie is also perfectly cast, but there's also a funny breaking of the fourth wall moment that calls that into question). Gosling easily steals all of the scenes he's in and I would love it if he got another Oscar nomination for this. When Barbie starts to develop a sort of consciousness, with thoughts of death, and visible signs of imperfection, Barbie and Ken enter the ""real world,"" where Barbie discovers the horrors of objectification and Ken discovers the joys of the patriarchy. While Barbie's presence in the real world is seen by the president of Mattel (Will Ferrell) as a threat to the very existence of both worlds, Ken takes what he learns back to Barbieland, turning it into a Kendomland filled with bros drinking ""brewski beers,"" playing guitar at the Barbies, or obsessing over horses and the Godfather movies. The ultimate message is that neither type of monosociety is ideal, but I couldn't help but think of this Kendomland more than once when watching Oppenheimer. The Ken-filled land of Barbie does quickly devolve into war (albeit one that includes a terrific fantasy dance sequence), and Oppenheimer does, of course, center on the creation of the ultimate weapon of war.  I liked Christopher Nolan's Memento a lot, but after that, I've found all of his films to be very loud, very busy, and very cold. He's Kubrick on steroids. Oppenheimer is all of those things, but Cillian Murphy's performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is so riveting I could almost feel some emotion while watching it. I felt a bit more watching Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, a character who for the majority of the movie is the troubled wife annoyed by her husband's work, but she eventually gets one of the best scenes in the movie. (Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's earlier girlfriend, Jean, is not given enough screen time, especially considering the film's length and the fact that she's really the only other major female character in it.) Oppenheimer like most of Nolan's other films, is loud, with a constant soundtrack that makes it feel like it is being constantly propelled forward, even though the movie is half flashback. Frankly, it's exhausting, but I have to admit, when the film finally does quiet, for the Trinity test, this sudden calm makes the scene all the more astonishing. It's perhaps the best sequence in any of his films to date. I'm not one of those people who insists the only way to truly experience films is in a theater. But I do think Oppenheimer will lose a lot of its impact on a small screen. I saw it in IMAX, which was perhaps a little TOO big and loud, but there is no doubt Nolan knows how to use that format effectively.  The Barbenheimer phenomenon pleases me primarily because it's proof there is room for an unapologetically pink feminist manifesto next to a deadly serious anti-war story in our existing cineplexes, and that plenty of people will indeed see both. It's a Barbenheimer World, and that's fantastic.",POSITIVE

When I learned that

"Jul 24, 2023"," Towards the end of Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist is asked about why his views on the atomic bomb that he helped create changed in a span of a few years. Oppenheimer’s reply is vague, unsatisfactory even. In the same way, the film about him dances around the question that has fascinated as well as plagued Oppenheimer’s admirers.  Nolan’s most political film plays out like a 1970s-style conspiracy thriller, in which unfounded suspicions about Communism combine with a narrow definition of nationalism to make a villain out of a hero. A sprawling cast, led by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, lines up for a movie that is grand in vision and grandiloquent in its staging. Oppenheimer takes off from America’s nuclear bomb programme, codenamed the Manhattan Project, in the early 1940s. The destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, meant to bring a brutal end to Japan’s continued opposition to the Allied forces during World War II, had tremendous moral consequences, most of all for the man who came to be known as the “father of the bomb”. The 190-minute film has been adapted by Nolan from the 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin. Rather than following a linear narrative that might have more effectively explained Oppenheimer’s fall from grace, Nolan opts for the mangled timelines, breakneck editing pattern and operatic sweep that mark his cinema.  The fragmented approach results in brilliant individual scenes that don’t add up to a composite picture. The extremely busy plot includes Oppenheimer’s formative years, his flirtation with Communism, his leadership of the Manhattan Project, the debates about the proper use of a destructive technology and Oppenheimer’s fraught ties with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and lover Jean (Florence Pugh).  Uniting these discrete elements is Oppenheimer’s persecution by the American government. Significant portions play out in a small room where a kangaroo court, instigated by the vengeful nuclear policy administrator Leslie Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and led by an aggressive lawyer (Jason Clarke), decides whether Oppenheimer is a Russian spy and therefore needs to be stripped of his security clearance. Nolan works overtime to make a talk-heavy narrative engaging at the intellectual and visual level. Characters are constantly on the move, striding through corridors and in and out of rooms where plans to make life-destroying weapons are pored over with Boy Scout-level glee.  Hoyte van Hoytema’s unnerving close-ups depict the paranoia building up around Oppenheimer. Surreal dream sequences reveal Oppenheimer’s growing disquiet over his choices. In the most effective of them, the laudatory stamping of feet after the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings have the sonic effect of a firing squad. The faces of Oppenheimer’s fans are twisted in a terrible display of misguided patriotism. (Indian censors have ensured that an explicit scene is trimmed to the point of being unintelligible. In a hilarious instance of bowdlerising, Pugh’s Jean gets a family-friendly makeover in a decidedly family-unfriendly moment.) Among the more pointed scenes is a conversation between Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and Oppenheimer. Like all the other actors, Conti makes his mark very fast in a film that has Cillian Murphy in nearly every other frame.  The star-studded cast includes Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, Benny Safdie, and Kenneth Branagh. Matt Damon winningly plays Leslie Groves, the Army officer who recruits Oppenheimer for the Manhattan Project. Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer’s long-suffering wife Kitty, delivers a grammar lesson with brittle-edged precision. Also Kitty: “You are being too goddamn gentlemanly!” The increasingly enervating focus on Oppenheimer’s vilification sidesteps bigger questions about the inner life of a brilliant man who was both opportunist and dissenter, warmonger and conscientious objector. By approaching Oppenheimer from the outside, through his actions or the reactions of people to him, the film takes the easy way out from confronting the paradoxes that defined one of the greatest scientific minds of our times. While it is impossible to fully know a person over the course of a movie, a better understanding of Oppenheimer’s contradictions remains out of reach. Cillian Murphy’s performance is accordingly incomplete. Murphy is excellent in portraying Oppenheimer’s nervous energy, ambivalence, and self-doubt. But the charisma that drew scores of scientists towards Oppenheimer or contributed to his personal relationships is missing.  The horrific destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is conveyed in words. The visual centrepiece is the first bomb test. Stripped of Ludwig Goransson’s onerous score, this sequence conveys the film’s major ideas so effectively that whatever follows seems like needless padding.  “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” Oppenheimer’s quotation from the Bhagwad Gita, says more than the rest of the verbiage. As clouds of fire reach the corners of the screen – the impact is especially terrifying on IMAX – we hear only Oppenheimer’s laboured breathing at the beauty and the bloodshed he has wrought.

"Jul 24, 2023"," by Walter Chaw Stolid, classical in form, stately in a way some would say is boring yet so precisely parcelled out in perfectly measured, oppressively scored, bite-sized mic-drop morsels that it holds one’s interest whether one is interested or not, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is indisputably well-made and certainly well-intended. If it’s not entirely unlike an amalgam of A Beautiful Mind and The Imitation Game, well, there you have it. As Oppenheimer ploughs no new furrows in the biopic game, what’s left to ponder is whether the story of the father of the atomic bomb is told with enough nuance and ambiguity to justify its declarative urgency, its…what is it? Self-satisfaction? Or, failing that, whether it has enough ticking-timebomb doomsday urgency to cut through the curtain of unjustifiably-pleased-with-itself-and-let-me-explain-to-you-why-with-an-unreasonable-amount-of-exposition that suffocates so much of Nolan’s recent work. I mean, it’s good, don’t get me wrong, but it’s neither novel nor mind-breaking–neither Mishima nor JFK. In the end, I’m not entirely convinced it’s much more than strong yeoman’s work bolstered by predictably fine performances from a prestigious cast hired to do what they always do. What I’m saying is that as the first heavily touted mainstream salvo of an awards season now imperilled by Hollywood labour strikes that could stunt year-end campaigns, it makes its methodical, unsurprising, airtight case for recognition by a long-devalued, antiquated organization and voting process that privileges all-star films like this about the Greatest Generation. All the usual concerns, all the usual suspects. It reminded me of the ad campaign for Volvo the lunatics in Crazy People (1990) come up with: “Buy Volvos, They’re Boxy But They’re Good. We know they’re not sexy. This is not a smart time to be sexy anyway with so many new diseases around. Be Safe Instead of Sexy. Buy Volvos.” Oppenheimer is a Volvo. You can drive it into the ground–and damn if Nolan doesn’t try. Consider what Oliver Stone brought to his American history lessons, once upon a time: a pure, unfiltered shot of screaming-hot madness; the homeless guy Stone played in his own The Hand who accosts you with his briefcase full of evidence and a bellyful of zealotic bile. Stone believes what he believes with more force and conviction than anything you’ve ever believed in your life. I exit movies like JFK and Nixon with a head full of bees. I don’t know that any of Nolan’s films have felt unnerving to me since maybe The Prestige. He has it in him (Memento is perverse as shit, ditto Following), but though I’m a staunch defender of his Dark Knight trilogy–he excels at monumentalizing iconography–I wonder where the dangerous, morally slippery, devil-may-care part of him has gone. He would be a fine choice to tell the story of the American Revolution, in other words, yet I wonder about his current ability to express the manifold atrocities of the dawning of the atomic age. Cillian Murphy, a veteran of Nolan’s work, plays J. Robert Oppenheimer as the sort of tweedy, neurodivergent genius who spends most of his time striding purposefully across various campuses, shouting at flocks of book-carrying acolytes, and running to answer telephones. (He also reads newspapers.) Gruff Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) recruits him to head America’s “Manhattan Project,” focused on creating an atomic bomb before the Nazis do. He chooses Oppenheimer despite the good doctor’s dalliances with the American Communist Party, his womanizing, his arrogance. Without seeing it, you can probably write the scene where these two men banter back and forth, the one winning grudging respect from the other with his unwillingness to play by the rules. Oppenheimer has an adulterous affair with Kitty (Emily Blunt), whose main qualities are that she’s a mean drunk and that’s kind of it, and another adulterous affair with–I think she’s a psychiatrist?–Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), whose main qualities are that she’s so depressed she acts at all times like a refugee from an I Never Promised You a Rose Garden travelling roadshow. While he’s fucking Jean one night, after demonstrating an extensive knowledge of psychotherapy by name-dropping Jung, he reads her the line from the Bhagavad Gita with which he has become associated: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Hot, I know. This line is closely identified with Oppenheimer because he says he muttered it after witnessing the first test of an atomic bomb, i.e., the “Trinity” test–named, we are told, after John Donne’s line “batter my heart, three-person’d God.” John Donne was a religious tourist, spendthrift, and philanderer. A bit of a rake who wrote amazing religious poetry because he compared his conversion with sexual ravaging. I find it disquieting, the lengths to which Nolan has gone to make his Oppenheimer simultaneously sexy and obsessed with star-collapsing quantum paradoxes like black holes and the atomic state of light. Was he thinking this meal is dry as a soda cracker and needed livening up with some cheese and horseradish? Anyway, Oppenheimer marries Kitty. It doesn’t really matter. He also gets the government to build him a scientific compound in Los Alamos, NM, where he had always dreamed of practicing physics. Then there’s a montage of him recruiting other scientists to uproot their families and live in the middle of nowhere for as long as it takes to develop a functioning atomic bomb. If you’re collecting physicist trading cards, you’ll be happy to see Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighofer) just for the principle of it, Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), Kurt Gödel (James Urbaniak) who is more mathematician, and of course Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who provides adorably hard-bitten wisdom at key moments. The other story is about the failed cabinet confirmation for Eisenhower nominee Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), who oversaw a tumultuous tenure as chair of the Atomic Energy Commission that Oppenheimer boils down to a largely inexplicable and obviously personal hatred of Oppenheimer for offenses public and private. This entire period of upheaval in the Senate, worthy of a movie of its own, leads to an extended “trial” sequence in which the question of renewing Oppenheimer’s security clearance is debated in a kangaroo court by hostile inquisitor Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), the strawman/scapegoat loaded down with the burden of America’s collective Red Scare sins seeking to humiliate a scientist after elevating him to a position of godhood. Oppenheimer is one part talking in New Mexico and another part talking in the Senate. On the bright side, Ludwig Göransson’s score is omnipresent and expository, while the recurring image of expanding circles on the surface of a pond is only used a few dozen times. If you squint just a little, you can see how the film is split into around 36 5-minute scenes that would fit neatly on notecards–three dozen delivery vehicles for gotcha lines, gravid historical references, and simplistic full-body-chills-bait. “Who voted against you? Oh, some senator from Massachusetts trying to make a name… JOHN F. KENNEDY! DID YOU HEAR ME?” This may be all that Oppenheimer is ultimately about: how we love wizards when there are dragons to slay and fear and loathe them, reduce them to political pawns and objects of scorn, when we don’t. How we only listen to science when it serves us, or how scientists will often do things without asking if they ought to first, and how the unintended consequences of their actions can have a lasting and irreversible impact. Oppenheimer is a Frankenstein story where J. Robert’s monster is the Cold War and policies of mutually assured destruction. The film opens, after all, with a brief telling of the Prometheus myth–Frankenstein being the “modern Prometheus,” right?–and proceeds with multiple characters calling Oppenheimer a martyr to his act of bringing nuclear fire to the affairs of nations. (Prometheus having been martyred for a while in the Caucasus and often thought of as the antecedent to the Christ myth.) Maybe it’s about the fact that we are what the T-800 says we are in Terminator 2: hellbound with an appetite for self-destruction, even as we’re fucking like rabbits and procreating like there’s actually a tomorrow. (Why else have Matt Damon mention that a number babies are being born at Los Alamos while Emily Blunt in a pregnancy suit rumbles on screen?) It’s all quite portentous, though I don’t know if it has anything revelatory to impart, making it not unlike other Christopher Nolan films, expensive nothingburgers like Tenet and Dunkirk and Inception, too, let’s face it. But I want Oppenheimer to succeed, because its ambitious and epically-scaled mediocrity is still preferable to the too-many-cooks algorithmic disasters dominating the marketplace. I wonder if it doesn’t seem better than it is because no real point of view is better than an entire boardroom of idiots with artless opinions. Anyway, JFK is great. You should watch that.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," If not for the atomic bomb, I might not be here. My father came of age during World War II. He trained to be a pilot in 1945, and even after Hitler shot himself in his Berlin bunker, the common wisdom was that a war was still on, that Japan would never surrender. The common wisdom was that it would take around a million U.S. service members to successfully invade Japan, my father being one of them. The common wisdom was that the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki saved lives in the long run. It seems to have saved my father’s life. And yet. The United States, my country, is the only country to use nuclear weapons in combat. So far. It’s bad enough to know that the bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people. It’s worse knowing the details. In Hiroshima, the bomb detonated directly over the Shima Surgical Clinic. Over ninety percent of Hiroshima’s doctors and nurses were killed. A person sitting on the stone steps of Sumitomo Bank was vaporized, and their shadow was burned into the stone. Immerse yourself too deeply in the details and the horror becomes overwhelming.* The atomic bomb began as a way to end a war. It might also end life as we know it on this planet. The wrong conflict, the wrong circumstances, the wrong leaders, and it ends with silence. Shadows burned into stone. J. Robert Oppenheimer knew this. He understood this paradox well before Hiroshima, and still he spearheaded the development of nuclear weaponry. His story is one of complexity and culpability, and it’s the subject of Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer. Nolan’s films like to play with time – how the characters perceive it, how the audience perceives it, and how a decision made hastily in the past can have enormous consequences in the future. This film is no different. Nolan mostly focuses on two eras, the timeline leading up to the 1945 Trinity test, and a 1954 government investigation regarding Oppenheimer’s security clearance. In the first timeline, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a young man in a hurry. He’s hurrying to become a major force in the young field of theoretical physics. His encounters with giants like Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) feel less like mentorship and more like a meeting of colleagues. Oppenheimer builds a name for himself, heedlessly leaps into a relationship with the fiery and doomed Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), then heedlessly leaps into another relationship and soon to be marriage with the already married Kitty Puening (Emily Blunt). Oppenheimer is also Jewish, and he’s painfully aware of the implacable tide of the Nazi march across Europe. There are whispers of German scientists working on a super weapon, a bomb that could irrevocably turn the tide of the war. Oppenheimer knows this, and when General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) asks him to spearhead the development of an American bomb, he leaps at the chance. In the second timeline, it’s 1954 and Oppenheimer is in the midst of the Red Scare. He assumed that his brilliance would allow him to get away with anything, including past meetings he had regarding the Communist Party. He’s wrong about that, wrong about a great many things, including the lengths that a canny political operator named Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) will go to obliterate him. It’s too early for me to say if Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s best film, though I do think he’s been building to this for a while. He’s hidden a thriller inside of a biopic. Those thrills mostly come from scenes of people in rooms talking in front of incomprehensible equations. Within their conversations, they grapple with the morality of the bomb, and within that Oppenheimer grapples with his impulsive nature. There are so many concepts and ethical dilemmas bursting from the film that, even with a three hour runtime, it doesn’t feel quite long enough. Scenes often move at a breakneck pace, and if the characters weren’t dealing with the Manhattan Project, you’d swear you’re watching a romantic comedy from the 1940s. Remember earlier I mentioned most of the thrills come from conversation? The exception to that is Nolan’s masterful sequence of the Trinity explosion. Part of what makes it so special is Nolan’s insistence on using practical effects.** The way it’s shot, edited, paced creates a mixture of awe and terrible dread. We’re with Oppenheimer at the awful birth of the atomic age, and we can feel the power that’s been unleashed. Back in the day, Great Man biopics were hugely popular. These men (and they were almost always white men), would fearlessly stride through the movie, bending history to their will. I think Christopher Nolan was aware of this with his screenplay, since he’s gone to considerable lengths to contrast Oppenheimer’s virtues with his flaws. For every time we see his brilliance at project management or physics, we also see his carelessness, womanizing, and egotism. We also see him struggling with his legacy as the father of the atomic age. At times he’s a true believer, one who thinks the bomb ought to be used against Japan to “save lives.” There’s also moments of magical realism, where Oppenheimer is confronted with the victims and knows nuclear proliferation ends in a death spiral. Nolan never portrays him as either a virtuous hero or a conniving monster. He’s a conundrum wrapped in the skin of a human being. It bears mentioning that, just like every other Christopher Nolan film, there are moments of genuine comedy amidst the sturm und drang. It’s gallows humor, to be sure. I particularly liked a monstrous sequence where American officials are picking possible bombing targets. One of them blithely mentions that Kyoto needs to not be bombed since he and his wife had a lovely honeymoon there. If there’s any kind of comic relief here, it’s Matt Damon as the harried Leslie Groves. Damon is always good, and while his performance might not be the awards darling, he’s quietly hilarious as a no-nonsense officer wondering if the bomb might accidentally ignite the planet’s atmosphere. Like the majority of Nolan’s films, the cast of Oppenheimer is ridiculously stacked. I liked Emily Blunt’s Kitty, her despair that her husband rarely listens to her and her vindication when he does.*** Florence Pugh is also excellent as the mercurial Jean Tatlock, an atomic bomb in human form. Jason Clarke does typically strong work as the prosecutorial Roger Robb, a man comfortable annihilating Oppenheimer’s reputation in the name of national security. The first and second among equals in the cast are Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Murphy has worked with Nolan before, but this is the first time he’s had a leading role. His cadaverous Oppenheimer is brilliant, indecisive, a whiz at running the Manhattan Project and a disaster as a husband and father. He’s also cursed with self-awareness, and comments on his ability to get away with actions that would have short-circuited others. His opposite number is Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, a man who pathetically reminds nearly everyone he comes into contact with that he’s a physicist, too. There’s a kind of Mozart/Salieri relationship between them. Downey does a masterful job portraying the simmering jealousy and resentment that drives Strauss. I’ve never seen Downey play someone so petty, so small, in a performance that’s so free of vanity. He and Murphy do such strong work that it doesn’t matter if they’re nominated for Oscars or not. Their work will endure beyond awards season.  Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of the most important people in human history. His actions led to the atomic bomb, and his subsequent actions were an attempt to atone for it. Oppenheimer is a film of towering brilliance and fearsome power. It focuses on a man who met the moment, and the same man may have doomed us all. *I learned that Little Boy, the bomb detonated over Hiroshima, was considered to be inefficient. Only 1.7 percent of the material contained within the bomb fissioned. This information did not make me feel better.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023"," As summer movies go, writer-director Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is in a class by itself. American moviegoers looking for a brief escape from the heat with brainless action or forgettable fun can waste their money on the latest Indiana Jones and Mission Impossible clones, people who will laugh at a public hanging have Asteroid City and Theater Camp, and anyone who isn’t allergic to pink has the insulting, obnoxious and idiotic Barbie. But if you want a single cinematic experience worth remembering after the summer of 2023 has come and gone, Oppenheimer is the one.  OPPENHEIMER ★★★1/2 (3.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Christopher Nolan 
Written by: Christopher Nolan 
Starring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh
Running time: 180 mins. The American public is not programmed to savor and embrace a three-hour movie about nuclear physics, so my serious concern for the longevity of this epic biopic about the man who invented the atomic bomb and changed the world is genuine. Initially, they’ll be intrigued enough by the rave reviews to see what the excitement is all about, but after hard-core Christopher Nolan fans and what’s left of a dwindling mature audience have seen it and word of mouth sets in, I doubt if Oppenheimer has legs. I hope I’m wrong, because this is a film with intelligence, purpose and historic value. Divided into sections which, in Nolan’s traditional dedication to style over substance, bounce all over the place like Mexican jumping beans, the film begins at the height of World War II after Einstein’s theory about splitting the atom is confirmed and the United States competes with Germany to see who will develop the inevitable atomic bomb first. J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy in a titanic performance that dominates almost every scene) was the scientist recruited by the military to head the Manhattan Project, the secret branch of the government devoted to creating the most powerful bomb known to mankind. Being a Jewish physicist with left wing political leanings, he worked feverishly to defeat the Nazis and end the war. Since he already owned a ranch in New Mexico,  it was there that a town called Los Alamos was constructed to house the temporary community that would build and eventually test the bomb once it was developed. The midsection of the film bogs down in a boring attempt to explain quantum physics, devoting a huge mass of time to the scientific elements of the bomb—uranium, titanium, hydrogen, plutonium, and the proportions of each. The internecine relations among members of the Manhattan Project are confusing and complex, but to relieve the scientific tedium Nolan introduces a human element as Oppenheimer’s staff nicknames him “Oppy” and in his signature pork pie hat he masters the art of mixing the perfect martini and debates his mistress (Florence Pugh) on the pros and cons of Communism.  The final section of the film details the ugly postwar ramifications of Oppy’s about face, when times had changed and the toxicity of the shameful McCarthy era made it easy to indict a man whose brother (Dylan Arnold) and wife (a firm, implacable Emily Blunt) were both once members of the Communist Party. So a figure once considered the most important man on the planet found himself betrayed, persecuted and humiliated by the same U.S. government he had once worked for so diligently, victimized in a smear campaign spearheaded by his once worshipful colleague Lewis Strauss (a wonderful Robert Downey, Jr.), who accused him of being a Russian spy. The movie goes off the rails again as it slides downward in a series of Senate interrogations that pit the numerous participants in Oppy’s life and career against each other.  Oppenheimer is inarguably an engrossing film of vast moral conviction and conflicted conscience, but its admirable scope is not always lucid.  In no way linear in structure—and gimmicked up with pretentious noise and camera cuts, switching from color to black and white, imploding with the sound of bomb blasts and stomping feet—the film becomes exasperating. Christopher Nolan films are usually about visuals, not character or plot, and the actors are along for the ride. This one, for a change, is about one of the most demanding and controversial chapters in American history and the man who made it happen. Nolan compiles the facts, but doesn’t seem content with facts alone. His inability to tell a story straight (or maybe the key word is his refusal) scatters a maximum of diverse elements in a dozen directions at once. A great story becomes plausible but incoherent. Fortunately, the story survives, and the one thing that works consistently throughout is the galvanizing centerpiece performance by Cillian Murphy.  He’s been in other films (including Nolan’s Dunkirk) but his output has never been prolific. This time he’s provocative and profound, in a demanding role headed for Oscar recognition. And he’s supported by an astounding cast, including unrecognizable Gary Oldman as a blunt and unlikeable Harry S. Truman, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Matt Damon as the lieutenant general who appoints Oppy to head the Manhattan Project in the first place, and Remi Malek, Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine, Kenneth Branagh, Tony Goldwyn, Casey Affleck, among others, every of them exemplary and perfect.

"Jul 24, 2023"," At the London premiere of Oppenheimer, writer-director Christopher Nolan, prior to walking out in solidarity with the strike by Hollywood actors and writers, told the audience that he expected people to be ‘blown away’ by his film. It was a worthy sentiment, clumsily expressed. Nolan’s keenly awaited picture tells the riveting story of J Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the brilliant theoretical physicist who ran the top-secret Los Alamos compound in New Mexico spearheading America’s Manhattan Project. That was the name given to the development of atomic weapons and most notably the devastating bombs dropped on Japan in 1945. Yet three hours after rolling my eyes at the English director’s choice of words, they were wide with wonder at the scale of his accomplishment. Oppenheimer is a stunningly well-made film, with one scene (you can guess which) that is genuinely jaw dropping in its intensity. Nolan received an Academy Award nomination for Dunkirk (2017) but must surely now be favourite to go one better. Let’s just hope that the current turmoil doesn’t scupper next year’s awards season, because Oppenheimer is the kind of achievement for which glittering statuettes exist. Nolan adapted his screenplay from a 2005 biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer, which won a Pulitzer Prize for its authors Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. I can’t speak for the book but on screen the story really has four components: the race to create atomic weapons ahead of the Nazis; the attempt to stop nuclear secrets falling into the hands of America’s wartime ally, Soviet Russia; the post-war campaign to besmirch Oppenheimer for his own alleged Communist affiliations; and finally, his messy private life. It’s a complicated tale that Nolan doesn’t particularly try to simplify. Whisking us forward and backward in time, from ‘Oppy’s’ time as a student at Cambridge University in the 1930s to the 1954 ‘security hearing’ in Washington DC where he is effectively on trial, the director trusts his audience to grasp what is going on. It’s not always easy. I confess that my own understanding of quantum mechanics, nuclear fission and related topics is approximately the breadth of an atom, maybe even a split atom, but I didn’t mind being occasionally baffled. This is grown-up storytelling of the highest quality. The acting is commensurately wonderful, led by Murphy, who inhabits the title role as completely as he does that of Tommy Shelby in the BBC drama Peaky Blinders. Robert Downey Jr is similarly excellent as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and arguably, apart from the unseen Nazis and a Soviet spy, the nearest thing this film has to a villain. But everywhere you look there are terrific actors at the top of their game, including Matt Damon as the army officer who recruits Oppenheimer to set up Los Alamos, Gary Oldman (as President Truman), Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck and, perfectly convincing as Albert Einstein, dear old Tom Conti. If the film has a flaw, it is perhaps that the female parts are underwritten. But Emily Blunt makes the most of her screen time as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty; ditto Florence Pugh as his emotionally fragile mistress, Jean Tatlock. Both women are former card-carrying members of the American Communist Party, and Oppenheimer’s own leftist sympathies are scrutinised after the war, understandably so even in the febrile McCarthyite era. Nolan, however, doesn’t mind showing his own cards. He plainly sees Oppenheimer as a flawed hero, absolved by this film of being anything other than an American patriot who understands better than anyone the murky ethics around the development of a nuclear arsenal. ‘I don’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon,’ he says. ‘But I know the Nazis can’t.’ The scene in which we see the weapon detonated, in a test in the desert near the Los Alamos laboratory, is, I don’t mind asserting, one of the most thunderously powerful pieces of cinema in the entire history of the medium. But beyond that virtuoso moment, much of Oppenheimer unfolds like a thriller, while not swerving profound questions about the morality of laying Hiroshima and Nagasaki to nuclear waste. I despair at the inordinate length of many films these days, yet even at three hours this one never seems unreasonably long. There is an awful lot of story to tell, and Nolan tells it magnificently.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," For his highly anticipated twelfth feature, Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan returns to the annals of history to probe the rise and fall of its titular theoretical physicist, perhaps better known by the moniker ‘father of the atomic bomb.’ Following 2017’s Dunkirk, it’s another expertly crafted period reenactment of the key figures involved in a transformative historical moment which changed the aspects of not only scientific understanding but political maneuverings between fickle world powers. As such, it’s Nolan in a somewhat less sensational form, cleaved to historical accuracy instead of his superficially complex genre efforts, which would suggest an adherence to more intricate characterizations than we’re used to in Nolan’s universe. Alas, such is not the case. While based on the 2005 publication American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan’s treatment puts the physicist under an extreme magnifying glass, with Cillian Murphy more than aptly portraying a brilliant man plagued by his decisions to create a weapon of mass destruction only to be later maligned for his suspected views and political affiliation. Nolan begins with Oppenheimer’s (Murphy) early days as a disillusioned student in Cambridge under the tutor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), when a chance meeting with Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) leads him to the University of Gottingen in Germany, where he meets Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), who would eventually be dispatched by the Nazi party in the nuclear arms race during WWII. When returning to the US, Oppenheimer would spearhead a course on quantum physics at Berkeley, heretofore a subject no one was studying, meanwhile engaged in a clandestine affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) who he meets at a Communist party gathering. Approached by Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who was selected by the US Army Corps to lead the secretive Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer is headhunted to build the atomic bomb, selecting a myriad of top tier scientists and relocate them to Los Alamos, where their secret research would eventually lead to the atomic bomb (the film quietly asserts the area was uninhabited, which is a convenient way to sidestep the ripple effects for a smattering of Hispanic homesteaders and indigenous peoples). The Trinity test is a success, leading President Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) to drop two atomic bombs on Japan and therefore end WWII. Oppenheimer, who married biologist Katherine ‘Kitty’ Puening (Emily Blunt), eventually courts the ire of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission who would appoint Oppenheimer to the commission only to be publicly humiliated by him. In response, Strauss orchestrated a nefarious hearing in 1954 to have Oppenheimer’s secret clearance revoked, silencing the scientist and ruining his reputation. Only five years later, Strauss’ actions would backfire on him during his confirmation hearing for the US Senate as President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Commerce when his actions were made public. There’s no doubt about Oppenheimer being an exquisite visual experience. Lensed by Nolan’s regular DP Hoyte Van Hoytema, there are breathtaking visual sequences indelibly enhanced by sound designer Randy Torres which should make this a required theatrical screening. And yet, there are the usual problems which tend to nag at the periphery of Nolan’s ventures regarding characterization dragged down by a distracting ensemble experience where most of the notable names and faces have nothing to do but flit across the screen and try their darndest to make an impression. More glaring, and somewhat egregious, are Nolan’s cartoonish female characters, with Emily Blunt as a caricatured alcoholic wife and mother who mainlines his dialogue like she’s trying to be Dorothy Parker dumbed down to television courtroom dialogue. Nolan often seems invested in creating women who are always prominent on the sidelines, motivating composites for men who either want to desire or destroy them, and Blunt joins a pool previously occupied by Elizabeth Debicki, Marion Cotillard and Anne Hathaway, all strong women whose hands are ultimately tied, their interests neglected. In Oppenheimer we also have Florence Pugh as a communist colleague and love interest for the physicist, though their courtship is marked by an unwanted exchange of flowers about as silly as the ‘pas de fleurs’ bit between Matthias Schoenaerts and Adele Exarchopolous in Michael R. Roskam’s Racer and the Jailbird (2017). Olivia Thirlby is on hand as a lady scientist on the Manhattan Project, but she may as well be a phantom. Murphy, who previously worked with Nolan as the villain Scarecrow in his Batman films, carries the film confidently, giving an unfussy, matter-of-fact performance as Oppenheimer (even if he sometimes appears to be a bit too old for scenes from the physicist’s youthful student days). On the other hand, Robert Downey Jr. is allowed to go complete ham by the end of the film as Admiral Lewis Strauss, a sneaky, backstabbing hater of Oppenheimer (and perhaps all scientists in general), reflecting Nolan’s blindspots as a screenwriter. The last hour of Oppenheimer juxtaposes the ruination of both men’s reputations in separate hearings meant ‘not to convict, but to deny’ their professional success. It’s a rather cold, hard end point considering the anxiety and excitement Nolan builds towards the first major test of the atomic bomb prior to its use on Nagasaki and Hiroshima (neither of which we see, instead crystallized in the imagined nightmares of Oppenheimer, envisioning how his creation eradicates life, albeit in less sensational ways than something James Cameron fashioned in 1991’s Terminator 2: Judgment Day).

"Jul 24, 2023"," Christopher Nolan directs his first biopic, depicting the scientist who developed the atomic bombs that would devastate and the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and bring an end to the Second World War. The British director’s twelfth feature is a fascinating and accomplished cinematic object, but as a study of greatness, Oppenheimer’s subject is often obscured by its author’s auteurist preoccupations. In the box office and culturally, Oppenheimer is proving nothing short of a phenomenon, one which surely goes beyond Nolan’s popularity as a mainstream filmmaker. His film has captured a moment in the zeitgeist that has been cannily exploited by viral marketers and internet culture as Barbenheimer – a portmanteau from Nolan’s film and Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which released on the same day. The films couldn’t be further apart, yet both appear to be capturing two halves of the same public mood, and a popular desire for popular mainstream event cinema that doesn’t involve superheroes, deep continuity or multiverses. It is as a cinematic object that Oppenheimer is most successful. Over the course of his career, Nolan has cultivated a predisposition for the grand, the operatic and the aspirationally classical. In the film, much is made of Oppenheimer’s famous line, quoted from the Bhagavad Gita, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”, but also of the scientist as a modern Prometheus. Nolan’s signature techniques – his nonlinear use of time and perspective, which increasingly collapses as the film progresses, his grandiloquent themes and emotional coldness, his use of sound to drown out dialogue and of course his love of the IMAX format – are all present here. But what they do, uniquely, is to transform the film itself into a Promethean object of spectacle, with the bomb as its terrible centre. We will leave the ethics of such representation for others to discuss, though the narrative – especially during the film’s second half – explores the toll on Oppenheimer’s conscious of the terrible loss of life he has wrought following the bombing of the Japanese cities. Oppenheimer the film is more interested in the existential and symbolic tear that the bomb represents: a spectacle so terrible that it has changed reality and may yet destroy it. There is a brilliance to Oppenheimer and it is impossible to deny Nolan’s technical genius at marshalling such a project: at times it is a truly sublime piece of work which in other hands would be little more than worthy Oscar bait. But it is also, often, a frustrating film, so often preoccupied with the tremendous burden that great men must shoulder: a theme which is neither as original nor as interesting as the film appears to think. While it may be a mistake to read too much of the artist into their art, it is hard not to see Nolan: the Great Filmmaker inserting himself into Oppenheimer: the Terrible Spectacle Maker. And so with Nolan’s auteurist signatures come his clichés, too, number one among them his damaged, desirable brunettes in Florence Pugh’s Communist Jean Tatlock and Emily Blunt’s suffering wife Kitty, both doing good work in thankless roles. More successful is the chemistry between Cillian Murphy and Matt Damon’s General Leslie Groves, while Robert Downey Jr. does a great job of mumbling his way through his role as duplicitous businessman Lewis Strauss (even if he is saddled with some utter clangers). Ever the craftsperson, rarely the artist, Nolan has constructed a grand and terrible machine, a fascinating object of cinema and a deeply frustrating work of imagination. Oppenheimer represents much of what is great about Nolan as a filmmaker and is devoid, mercifully, of many of the indulgences of his previous pictures. Nevertheless, it is perhaps the purest example yet of the director’s vision of history: as one bent by great men, who are in turn moulded by its arc; never was it clearer just how much Nolan aspires to that arc himself.",POSITIVE

"Jul 24, 2023"," Christopher Nolan has an eye for spectacle and an eye for scale, and he evokes worlds that are massive and almost always on the brink of destruction. With “Oppenheimer” ambitiously ventures in to a more personal film that is a lot about power and a world almost always on the brink of destruction thanks to man delving deep in to the power that they are capable of. Nolan trades spectacle for a more personal albeit just as intense dramatic thriller about “Father of the Atomic Bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientist that invariably opened up a Pandora’s Box with his hand in the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer is not just a scientist but one tasked with the burden of what he’d inevitably help give birth to with his creation of the Atom bomb and its use during World War II. Oppenheimer himself is an understated madman of sorts, whose own personal life comes crashing in to his professional life. Despite his best efforts, he’s a man who is a victim to his own hubris, and this results in sadly a lot of deaths that are both personal and ultimately written off as casualties for the greater good. “Oppenheimer” doesn’t endorse the Manhattan Project, but remains firmly neutral, instead asking us to comprehend the scope of the power that Oppenheimer helped unleash on to the world. “Oppenheimer” is about as loud and explosive as one would imagine as Nolan implements stark close ups and non-linear storytelling, as well as erratic sound design as a means of punctuating the trials Oppenheimer endures throughout. There’s the inevitable testing of the bomb that is stunningly staged, as well as a pretty unnerving moment where the sounds of feet stomping and hands clapping almost resemble bombs detonating by the dozens. Nolan digs in to the origin of J. Robert Oppenheimer from his time as an aspiring student, to a revered scientist and his work on the Manhattan Project. Concurrently he’s a victim to his own personal demons, consistently cheating on his long suffering wife. Oppenheimer can barely handle the small explosions on his personal life but he’s instrumental in engineering one of the most horrific weapons of mass destruction ever conceived. Nolan jumps back and forth with Oppenheimer’s inquisition with the US government over renewing his access. All the while he evades attempts by his colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr. is marvelous) to undermine his credibility and loyalty to the program. Nolan’s intimacy borders on intrusive at times, injecting a sense of urgency in every narrative beat, and implementing various close ups. Star Cillian Murphy (one in a massive ensemble cast) is mostly the focus as we get to experience the awe and subtle horror in his evolution as a scientist, and what he would usher in over the course of his life. “Oppenheimer” is not so much, in the end, about the creation of a massive weapon, but about petty and spiteful men that have access to that massive weapon just waiting in the wings. It’s a concept that not even Oppenheimer could really have foretold, and it’s a terrifying idea when one stops and soaks it in. Sure to be recognized come Oscar season, “Oppenheimer” is a masterstroke from Christopher Nolan who devises an intricate, engrossing and important drama that’s as resonant today than it ever has been.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," One of the most anticipated films of the summer, Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer is finally here and feels like a significant cinematic event. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career, and future Oscar nominations may come calling for Robert Downey, Jr. and Emily Blunt when awards season returns.  A dense, swirling, dizzying cinematic experience, with Nolan building tension with words and conflict, as opposed to the more traditional action and science-fiction foundation he has become known for. This is a talk-heavy, non-linear story that lacks significant context around some of the historical facts and figures Nolan places in his screenplay. A portion of the viewing audience is likely going to have a difficult time following all of this, even if they concentrate and focus on everything coming at them. If you are expecting something akin to the Batman trilogy, Dunkirk, or Inception or Interstellar, this is a different Christopher Nolan movie than you have seen before. Many critics are in love with this movie. I am not sure the general public will be as open and affirming when they settle in and see the final product. Expansive, dense, and undoubtedly a film more accurately judged by time rather than immediate reactions, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer serves as a three-hour treatise on not only J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the origins of nuclear armament, but also on how fear, paranoia, and influence can dismantle even the most brilliant minds.As a filmmaker who has never been content in conforming to conventional storytelling, Nolan’s screenplay, adapted from the extensive 700-page-plus biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” (written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin in 2005), propels us forward and backward in a dizzying, somewhat disorienting biopic that calls to mind Oliver Stone’s JFK. In broad strokes, there is much to celebrate in Nolan’s 12th feature. Though not comparable in genre to his previous work, he remains a compelling dramatic filmmaker. Brandishing a buzzing, almost feverish approach to his biopic, he immerses us directly into the story, eventually building to moments of heightened tension and conflict.While much of the conflict here is verbal in nature, Nolan’s buildup to the legendary June 1945 Trinity Test, where Oppenheimer’s team observes the detonation of their very own creation - the first-ever nuclear bomb - is a shining example of how the writer/director can layer moment after moment and keep us rippling with anticipation. While the Trinity Test delivers an all-time Nolan sequence, for a considerable amount of time in the film we find ourselves watching two concurrent hearings - one a congressional confirmation hearing of Atomic Energy Commission President Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), largely shot in black-and-white, as he is being considered for the Secretary of Commerce role in the Eisenhower White House. A second takes place in a claustrophobic conference room as Oppenheimer is having renewal of his security clearance evaluated in a heavily tilted setting; one where his lone legal representative tries to navigate a hearing that feels pre-determined in stripping Oppenheimer of both his legacy and reputation.Oppenheimer envelopes, and at times, overwhelms you. Within minutes, the film embeds us into the physicist’s world and deep into the recesses of his mind. Jennifer Lame’s precise editing is sudden and swift, never lingering too long, reflecting the rapid pace at which Oppenheimer’s mind operates. At times, we move too swiftly and, as a viewer, you become awash in scholarly discussions about quantum mechanics, nuclear isotopes, and theoretical formulas. Oppenheimer’s tormented mind offers little room to breathe, and Nolan often paces his film at a similarly breathtaking speed.Below the line, Ludwig Göransson’s score is truly unrelenting, potentially divisive in its final presentation, and ever-present with its orchestral swings and flourishes. While the sound mix proves largely impressive, I did have some issues picking up elements of dialogue. Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography captures a vivid and reflective tone, meticulously depicting moments both large and small.  Expansive, dense, and undoubtedly a film more accurately judged by time rather than immediate reactions, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer serves as a three-hour treatise on not only J.

While the sound mix proves largely impressive, I did have some issues picking up elements of dialogue. Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography captures a vivid and reflective tone, meticulously depicting moments both large and small.  In his portrayal of Oppenheimer, this is Cillian Murphy’s finest performance to date. His rhythmic cadence and measured determination is less of a performance and more the embodiment of a man who changed the world, but wrestled with grave concerns over his actions. Murphy’s trademark blue eyes are full of watery burden, often fixated on a thought, process, or plan of action.

As someone celebrated as an American hero, Nolan’s presentation of Oppenheimer is a fascinating one - was he simply caught up in the challenge of creating the most destructive weapon known to mankind or was he quietly reserved and questioning the process all along?Nolan and Murphy break through the aura of the man, showcasing a flawed genius - steadfast, uncompromising, and almost painfully restrained in his professional life. A known womanizer, his extramarital affairs, which included longtime girlfriend Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), would continue after his marriage to biologist and former communist, Kitty Puening (Emily Blunt). Oppenheimer’s questionable connections to Communism in the 1930s would also resurface, with Strauss publicly questioning his loyalty during the “Red Scare” which followed the end of World War II.The film’s quick-cut approach mirrors the act of rifling through one’s memories. Consequently, the extensive cast Nolan has assembled, consisting of recognizable actors portraying scientists, professors, politicians, and government officials, can become nearly impossible to track and follow. Moreover, minimal context is provided to explain the significance of many characters who influence the story. The numerous cameos and appearances, including Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchan, and Dane DeHaan, among others, rush in and out without significant development. One exception occurs with Josh Hartnett, notable as Ernest Lawrence, a colleague and mentor of Oppenheimer’s, whose work on separating uranium isotopes influenced the Manhattan Project. While Nolan elicits a powerhouse performance from Downey, Jr., there are inconsistencies in how certain characters are positioned in terms of the ultimate impact they have in the film’s final act. Also problematic is the way Nolan presents both Pugh and Blunt, each underwritten and one-note in their depth and substance. Though Blunt delivers big in a showy moment that may very well place her in Oscar consideration (Downey, Jr. and Murphy will almost certainly exist in those same conversations), Nolan frames her as little more than a negligent drunk, fixated on demanding her husband fight to preserve his legacy. Pugh’s character, intentionally scattered and difficult to read, is simply reduced to Oppenheimer’s lustful gaze, including one unintentionally comic scene, imagined by Oppenheimer, which nearly stops the film dead in its tracks.Some critics have already championed Oppenheimer as one of the greatest films of the 21st century. Again, time will tell. The film carries an inaccessibility, despite Nolan’s attempts to make a powerful, defiant, and damning statement on American exceptionalism. Though many moments undeniably resonate, Oppenheimer is so tightly packed, we cannot get close - ironically kept at almost too safe a distance from the emotional detonations Nolan has worked so hard to create.  In his portrayal of Oppenheimer, this is Cillian Murphy’s finest performance to date. His rhythmic cadence and measured determination is less of a performance and more the embodiment of a man who changed the world, but wrestled with grave concerns over his actions. Murphy’s trademark blue eyes are full of watery burden, often fixated on a thought, process, or plan of action.

"Jul 24, 2023"," Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. The film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission.  Academy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence. Oppenheimer also stars Oscar® winner Rami Malek and reunites Nolan with eight-time Oscar® nominated actor, writer and filmmaker Kenneth Branagh. The cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises).  The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography. One of the strongest elements of Oppenheimer lies in the acting of the cast. Cillian Murphy’s performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer is a tour de force. He convincingly portrays the brilliance, internal conflicts, and moral dilemmas of the renowned physicist. Murphy’s ability to embody Oppenheimer’s complex persona elevates the film, making it an engaging character study. Emily Blunt was probably one of my favorites in the film. She had some key moments where she simply shined and probably seemed the most relatable out of all the characters. Matt Damon was solid as well given his role as Gen. Groves Jr. Additionally, the witty dialogue and banter between Matt Damon, who plays General Leslie Groves Jr., and Cillian Murphy enhance the film’s entertainment value.  However, the one potential scene-stealer might have been Robert Downey Jr. He completely disappeared into the role of Lewis Stauss, and his delivery was so good that it would be no surprise to have him be considered for Best Supporting Actor. Nolan’s signature cinematography is at its finest in Oppenheimer. The best part was the artistic visuals used to convey the mental duress faced by Oppenheimer during the Manhattan Project. The visuals captured the weight of the decisions he had to make and the profound implications of his work.  I appreciated the sections shot in black-and-white analog photography, which created a visually striking contrast and added depth to crucial scenes. Other technical feats were well executed too such as the sound production. I was really impressed with how both the sound design and score played such a significant role in enhancing key moments in the film. From the deafening sounds of the testing ground to the hauntingly atmospheric musical compositions, the audio elements contribute to the film’s emotional impact. The tension and build-up leading to the moment of the atomic bomb’s creation are masterfully handled. I thought it was a brilliant decision by Nolan to mute all sound during some key moments. As a viewer, it almost felt like after so much suspense was built up you still had a moment where you were holding your breath in anticipation for what was still to come. Nolan navigated the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team, crafting an immersive experience that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. Oppenheimer is not without its flaws and I personally wasn’t the biggest fan of the editing. I thought that it made the plot feel a bit cumbersome and challenging to follow.  Given the 3 hour runtime, the editing and writing made the pacing of the movie noticeable. Just when you think this movie was all about the making of the bomb, it swerves into another direction about Oppenheimer’s personal life, and then another swerve into the political drama. Essentially, it felt like multiple movies crammed into one. To make matters a bit more difficult, in true Nolan fashion, much of the exposition felt heavy-handed. There seemed to be a presumption in the film that viewers should already be aware of the politics during the 1940s and have a physics degree of some sort. The issue I think this may pose is that while some people are learning many of the historical or scientific facts for the first time, it takes away the opportunity to really engage with the plot. It would be like studying for a test and listening to a friend tell you a story at the same time. Moreover, the film’s political and legal drama may feel heavy-handed to some viewers. While it is essential to depict the socio-political context of the era accurately, a more subtle approach could have balanced the film’s focus better. Another aspect that draws criticism is the portrayal of female characters in the film. While Florence Pugh’s performance as Jean Tatlock is commendable, the writing of her characters may come across as lacking an authentic appeal. I think this also trickled down into an over-arching issue in the writing which was that I didn’t feel much of an emotional anchor was present. When I talk about an emotional anchor, that usually comes from the main protagonist in the film to help create a relational point for the audience. While it was demonstrated that Oppenheimer did have some trying times, my issue with the editing of the story came back into play. Right when I started to connect with Oppenheimer, we immediately jumped into some science experiment, legal drama, or historical event that snapped me out of it. A bit more of a focus might have been helpful in that case. Oppenheimer is an enthralling deep dive into the life and choices of J. Robert Oppenheimer. With outstanding performances, impressive cinematography, and gripping tension, it offers a captivating experience for audiences. I do believe that the marketing of Oppenheimer was a bit misleading because it initially gives the impression that it’s about Oppenheimer and the lead-up to the A-bomb. If you’re going into this thinking that you’re going to get some crazy explosion and massive casualties and such, then you’re going to be disappointed. This is a biopic that has a lot of story to tell. Too much story in some instances. While I did enjoy Oppenheimer overall, I can’t say I’d ever want to watch this movie again. Out of the previous categories I mentioned, I’m a Nolan fan, but I didn’t particularly care for Dunkirk. I have a general understanding of physics from school, but this movie felt like I walked into a pop quiz. I also wasn’t fully aware, nor interested, of the politics of the time. So for me, this movie felt like a chore to get through. I feel like Nolan does so many things technically right in his movies that it’s really hard for him to make a bad movie. With that said, I wouldn’t say Oppenheimer is one of Nolan’s best films, but his worst films are still better than most. I’d say Oppenheimer probably ranks in the bottom three of Nolan films along with Dark Knight Returns and Dunkirk. One thing I noticed in my observations with people who have seen the movie is that there are factors that might depend based on the viewer. For those of you who are history buffs, that are remotely familiar with the communist party, WWII, and the politics of the 1940s, then this movie is for you. For those of you who have a general understanding of physics, then this movie is for you. If you’re a Nolan fan and love movies like Tenet or Dunkirk, then this movie is really for you. If you don’t fall into any of those categories, then I wouldn’t say this movie isn’t for you. I’d just say to prepare for more than what was advertised. Nevertheless, be sure to see Oppenheimer in theaters when you can.  Director: Christopher Nolan Writer(s): Christopher Nolan Stars: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Josh Hartnett and Kenneth Branagh Oppenheimer hits theaters July 21, 2023.

"Jul 24, 2023"," In an astounding performance, Cillian Murphy plays Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The movie reminds us that we all have blood on our hands. In an astounding performance, Cillian Murphy plays Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The movie reminds us that we all have blood on our hands. When the atomic blast finally happens in Christopher Nolan’s epic biopic “Oppenheimer,” heralding the horrific dawn of nuclear aggression as it first assaults the eyes and then the ears, it’s a strange form of catharsis for the viewer. For two hours, we’ve watched as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as the “father of the atomic bomb,” has inched towards this Trinity test explosion of July 16, 1945. He laboured with his top-secret Manhattan Project team in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to put quantum mechanics theory into wartime reality, by harnessing nuclear fission to create a devastating new weapon. At the same time, Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy with almost supernatural precision, has had to repeatedly defend his good name, his U.S. patriotism and his scientific bona fides. Some military leaders and politicians have questioned his abilities and loyalties, due to his past curiosity about, and continuing alliances within, the American Communist Party. The successful test blast briefly relieves the tension, for an exultant Oppenheimer and for us, even as we know it will soon lead to the nuclear bombing of Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a reported death toll that runs as high as 200,000-plus people. (The mournful score by Ludwig Göransson, which ratchets up the gloom throughout the film, suggests to me the sound of angels crying.) Oppenheimer is hailed as a hero for violently bringing the Second World War to a close, even as he doubts the morality of what he’s wrought and fears a catastrophic future nuclear war. The persecution of the man continues and escalates for the film’s third and final hour, as the McCarthyite witch hunters of the 1950s — epitomized by Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, whom Robert Downey Jr. plays with furious energy — seek to destroy his reputation. Nolan’s film, adapted from the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, ultimately becomes a masterful exposition of opposites. The brilliant but naive Oppenheimer weakly tries to defend himself against the conniving and opportunistic Strauss, a pairing the writer/director has compared to the Mozart/Salieri rivalry of classic music infamy. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyt van Hoytema shrewdly heighten the differences between the two men and denote shifting timelines by switching between colour and black and white, the former for Oppenheimer and the latter for Strauss. Downey is great as Strauss, but he comes across as almost a cartoon figure. Murphy is rightly the giant of the piece, riveting our attention from the moment we first see him as a depressed Cambridge University student, “useless in the lab,” who finds his footing via the new science of quantum physics. A dandy in his porkpie hat and immaculate suits, he’s also prodigiously intelligent, able to learn multiple languages at ease. He impresses even his skeptical contemporary Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who will eventually become an ally, but Oppenheimer is careless with his relationships and stupid about the ways of the world. Back home in the U.S., he takes a lover, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a Communist Party member, and later a wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), who was also once a party member. Oppenheimer never officially becomes a Communist, declaring himself to be a red-blooded American, but he innocently asks, “Why limit ourselves to one dogma?” That explanation is good enough for Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the Pentagon builder who taps Oppenheimer to head the bomb-making Manhattan Project, even though he knows the scientist “couldn’t run a hamburger stand.” But Groves is desperate, since the Nazis are likely working on their own atomic bomb and there’s no time to waste. The interplay between Murphy’s suave Oppenheimer and Damon’s gruff Groves is another oppositional highlight of the film. So is the pairing of Murphy with Emily Blunt, the woman who makes the greatest impact in this male-dominated picture. Fiercely loyal to her husband despite his philandering ways and patrician manner, strained by the demands of raising a daughter almost on her own and too dependent on alcohol for relief, she’s very much the fire to his ice. Nolan could have made so much more of the “Oppie and Kitty” story, but there’s only so much that can be packed into even a three-hour movie, and this one is quite the full package. Just listing and describing all the star supporting players in the movie could fill up a review. The superb cast list includes an almost unrecognizable Gary Oldman as U.S. President Harry S. Truman, who greets Oppenheimer in the Oval Office to congratulate him for his Manhattan Project achievements. Finding the scientist to be penitent about the A-bomb and worried and anxious about a future hydrogen bomb capable of vastly greater destruction, Truman mockingly reminds Oppenheimer that “the blood on his hands” he frets about is really the president’s, the man who ordered the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In truth, as “Oppenheimer” commandingly reminds us, the blood is on all our hands. Global nuclear war, most recently threatened by Russian leader Vladimir Putin in his assault on Ukraine, stopped being unthinkable the moment the first A-bomb exploded, cheered on by the man and his enablers who stole fire from the gods. Correction — July 21, 2023: Vladimir Putin is the current president of Russia. A previous version of this article referred to him as Soviet leader.

"Jul 24, 2023"," Twenty years ago, a frail Cillian Murphy found himself running from the horrors of a brave new world in Danny Boyle’s fast-paced “28 Days Later.” In Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer,” the Irish actor, looking equally brittle, finds himself devising the horrors of a brave new world as the Father of the Atomic Bomb. Featuring an all-star cast, the three-hour biopic moves at a wordy breakneck speed toggling black and white with saturated color. It’s fascinating, too long, and should come with an honorary degree in quantum physics. Based on Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird’s book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the highly anticipated biopic written and directed by Christopher Nolan begins with our eponymous protagonist on his way up the academic ladder as a student at Cambridge and then a brief scene at Germany’s University of Göttingen where Oppenheimer earned his Ph.D. in physics. Fast forward to Princeton N.J. where we meet this story’s villain Lewis Strauss (a terrific Robert Downey Jr.), a wealthy businessman and former officer in the Navy Reserve who went on to become the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Institute for Advanced Study while teaching at Berkeley. Strauss admired Oppenheimer’s work, but his personal ambitions turned him into the physicist’s number one enemy.  Oppy, as he’s referred to by most, says he’ll “think about” Strauss’ offer. (strike one). Then upon meeting Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), the two share a few quick words, Strauss is convinced that Oppy turned the “theory of relativity” physicist against him after Einstein stopped speaking to Strauss (strike two). Oppenheimer’s ties to the Communist Party and his post-bomb anti-nuclear stance are strike three for Strauss. It’s great seeing Downey Jr., post-Marvel, in a drama doing what he does best. It’s an Oscar-caliber performance and, apart from the title character, the film’s best role. After years of playing the hero, Downey Jr. seizes every moment on screen suggesting that Nolan’s epic is equally a Strauss biopic. The director switches from color to stylistic black and white for most of Strauss’ scenes taking the audience to a time after the bomb as confirmation hearings take place to appoint the former AEC chairman as U.S. Secretary of Commerce. Watching Downey Jr. squirm while reacting to damming testimony by physicist David Hill (Rami Malek) who exposes the tactics used by Strauss to blacklist Oppenheimer, is one of the film’s best moments, especially the scene when Strauss realizes he won’t get confirmed as he engages in biting dialogue with an aide played by Alden Ehrenreich. The lack of color during these moments reinforces Strauss’ dichotomous thinking and conservative ideology. Everything to him was black-and-white with no room for interpretation. “Oppenheimer” moves at a breakneck pace to get the audience to the money shot, the Trinity Test. Matt Damon plays General Leslie Groves who hires Oppy to spearhead the Manhattan Project, the development of the world’s first nuclear weapon. With rumors of the Nazis building their own weapon of mass destruction, the US raced against the clock as Oppenheimer and his team (played by actors that include Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Michael Angarano, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and Olivia Thirlby) worked tirelessly to construct the Atomic Bomb at a facility in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Ripe with tension, the scene is filled with intermittent moments of silence and turbulence as the screen explodes in a dash of white light followed by a firestorm of fury. Nolan downplays Oppenheimer’s reputation as a womanizer, concentrating on his relationship with German botanist Kitty (Emily Blunt), a member of the communist party who at the time was married. She left her husband for Oppy; they had two children. Kitty lived at Los Alamos which led to her becoming an alcoholic as seen in the film. Blunt’s emotional performance provides a welcomed balance to the male-dominated story. The other prominent woman in Oppy’s life, Jean Tatlock, is played by Florence Pugh in a bold performance that establishes the film’s R-rating. Tatlock meets Oppenheimer at a communist member gathering. The graduate student begins a torrid affair with the physicist-professor as Pugh appears fully nude in a couple of sexually explicit scenes including a quirky moment where Kitty imagines Tatlock grinding on Oppy’s lap while he’s being interrogated by circuit judge Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) during the private 1954 AEC hearings.  The mock trial was meant to determine if Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy. The proceeding was a sham perpetrated by Strauss to blacklist the one-time hailed American hero who is credited with ending WWII. Other prominent actors in Nolan’s biopic include Kenneth Branagh as Noble prize-winning physicist Niels Bohr, Gary Oldman in a quick but penetrating scene as President Truman, Matthew Modine as American engineer Vannevar Bush, and Tony Goldwyn as attorney Gordon Gray, who like Roger Robb, was on the committee aimed at discrediting Oppenheimer. With a running time of three hours, most of it closeups and dialogue (except for ear-splitting special effects meant to represent various properties of quantum physics doing the neutron dance, or just moments of loudness to wake up any stragglers), the film would have benefitted from a few edits. Hoyte van Hoytema’s dazzling cinematography lives up to the hype. Shot on large-format 65-millimeter film and Imax 65-millimeter film (with special black and white stock developed by Kodak at Nolan’s request), “Oppenheimer” begs to be seen in 70mm IMAX for the ultimate presentation. There are only 2 theaters in the state of Texas that can display the format and fortunately one is in Dallas. (Cinemark 17 & IMAX). Do you need to see “Oppenheimer” in 70mm IMAX? No, you don’t. The digital presentation looks terrific and the uncropped information missing at the top and the bottom of the frame is not significant enough to make a difference. It’s not like the letterbox vs pan-and-scan debate where actual characters were left out of the frame. So, while 70mm IMAX is not necessary to get the full impact of Nolan’s film, think of it as a special occasion where, as a movie lover, you treat yourself to a presentation that’s comparable to dining out at a fine restaurant. If you have access to a theater displaying the format, go for it. Now showing in theaters. To experience the film in the preferred 70mm IMAX format, head to Cinemark 17 & IMAX. Although you may have to wait a while before you can get a ticket. All showings have sold out since Thursday including the 6:45am and 2:35am screenings as the film is being shown around the clock.

"Jul 24, 2023"," No cabe duda de que, en eso de la mercadotecnia, la industria hollywoodense se las sabe todas. Para promover una pelÃ­cula difÃ­cil como Oppenheimer se creÃ³ un acto llamado Barbenheimer para treparla a la espalda de Barbie, y confiar en la ingenuidad del pÃºblico. Pensando que quizÃ¡ se trataba de un nuevo superhÃ©roe, miles de espectadores acudieron a la cita sÃ³lo para toparse con una narrativa densa de tres horas sobre, bÃ¡sicamente, conversaciones entre cientÃ­ficos y polÃ­ticos. Observen cÃ³mo la venta de boletos empezarÃ¡ a declinar. El cine del britÃ¡nico Christopher Nolan nunca ha sido sencillo. Ya en su anterior Tenet (2020) nos enfrentÃ³ a un relato del todo incomprensible (al menos para mÃ­). Ahora esta biopic sobre el cientÃ­fico estadunidense J. RobertOppenheimer, considerado âel padre de la bomba atÃ³micaâ, contiene varias aristas y su compleja personalidad es descrita con los previsibles saltos de tiempo. Desde la juventud de Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) âu Oppie, como le dicen sus amigosâ y su comprobada ineptitud para ejercer la fÃ­sica en el laboratorio, el hombre sobresale por sus hallazgos en la fÃ­sica cuÃ¡ntica. Luego un paso por la universidad de Berkeley revelarÃ¡ su simpatÃ­a con el Partido Comunista y provocarÃ¡ el conflictivo romance con la militante Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). En el mismo sitio conocerÃ¡ a Kitty (Emily Blunt), su futura y alcohÃ³lica esposa. La posibilidad de dividir el Ã¡tomo le abrirÃ¡ la idea de un arma poderosa y el interÃ©s del ejÃ©rcito por contratarlo a Ã©l para dirigir algo llamado el Proyecto Manhattan. Estamos en 1943 y a Estados Unidos, representados por el general Leslie R. Groves (Matt Damon), le urge adelantarse a los nazis en eso de desarrollar la bomba atÃ³mica. Nolan es fiel a la biografÃ­a deOppenheimer, pero como la cuenta en fragmentos no lineales, es necesario estar atentos. El realizador usa a actores conocidos para darle rostro a los numerosos cientÃ­ficos que intervendrÃ¡n en el proyecto; y tambiÃ©n para identificar a los polÃ­ticos que someten al protagonista a una audiencia para cuestionar su ideologÃ­a y lealtad al paÃ­s. En particular, es importante la presencia de Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), fundador de la ComisiÃ³n de EnergÃ­a AtÃ³mica en 1947 y principal antagonista de Oppie. Por supuesto, la secuencia que se aparta del blablablÃ¡ y le permite a Nolan ejercitar su mÃºsculo visual es aquella donde, en el desierto de Los Ãlamos, se experimenta con hacer estallar la primera bomba atÃ³mica de la historia. Un gran acierto, en una pelÃ­cula en la cual la mÃºsica y los efectos sonoros son incesantes, es optar al principio por el silencio. El despliegue de imÃ¡genes resulta eficaz, mas no impresionante. Ciertamente se necesitaba mÃ¡s para justificar la cita atribuida al dios Vishnu y pronunciada por Oppenheimer: âYo soy la Muerte, el destructor de los mundosâ. DespuÃ©s sigue el anticlÃ­max. La larga audiencia que le permitirÃ¡ al biografiado expiar sus culpas y medir quiÃ©nes le son leales en el periodo negro del macartismo. La coda es que Oppenheimer fue alcanzado finalmente por sus demonios, imaginando una realidad de devastaciÃ³n nuclear.

"Jul 24, 2023"," DespuÃ©s de la notable escenificaciÃ³n que hizo Christopher Nolan en Dunkerque (2017) del sitio brutal que padecieron 400 mil soldados amenazados de muerte por el ejÃ©rcito nazi en 1940, el realizador britÃ¡nico regresa al tema bÃ©lico en Oppenheimer (2023), donde relata de modo no lineal momentos clave de la vida de J. Robert Oppenheimer (un Cillian Murphy magnetizante) a partir de la biografÃ­a Prometeo americano, de Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin. A diferencia de Dunkerque, una cinta cargada de acciÃ³n con los pormenores de un intenso drama colectivo, lo que ahora se narra es la batalla interior que libra el protagonista con su propia conciencia al percatarse, abrumado por la culpa, de que sus esfuerzos como fÃ­sico matemÃ¡tico en el diseÃ±o de una bomba atÃ³mica no contribuyeron a elevar a la humanidad a un grado superior de civilizaciÃ³n, sino a operar una regresiÃ³n a sus instintos mÃ¡s primitivos, como el que decidiÃ³ humillar y doblegar a un enemigo japonÃ©s virtualmente ya vencido, y que ocasionÃ³ el exterminio de mÃ¡s de 200 mil personas en Hiroshima y en Nagasaki en 1945. Lo interesante en esta nueva cinta del director de Amnesia (2000) y El origen (2010) es que toda su narraciÃ³n laberÃ­ntica y dislocada, a menudo verbosa, que yuxtapone cronologÃ­as, acumula personajes, opera transiciones del color al blanco y negro para enfatizar texturas o conferir un toque documental, conduce en definitiva al mayor acierto de la cinta: la composiciÃ³n dramÃ¡tica del propio Oppenheimer, un personaje sicolÃ³gicamente complejo al que Nolan incorpora a su galerÃ­a de personajes sombrÃ­os en calidad de vÃ­ctima de una persecuciÃ³n polÃ­tica, pero tambiÃ©n de villano involuntario, responsable moral de una bombardeo genocida. A Oppenheimer le toca vivir una Ã©poca entregada a la paranoia polÃ­tica, en la que la URSS, por breve tiempo un paÃ­s aliado a Estados Unidos en el combate antinazi, se transforma en enemigo mÃ¡ximo de Occidente. Son tiempos de una cacerÃ­a de brujas por parte de la ultraderecha estadunidense que incluyen la ejecuciÃ³n de Ethel y Julius Rosenberg, considerados espÃ­as al servicio del adversario. No muy distinto es el caso de Oppenheimer, quien pasa de ser una celebridad cientÃ­fica a volverse un hombre polÃ­ticamente sospechoso. No sÃ³lo por lo que se sabe de su pasado o su relaciÃ³n con Katherine (Emily Blunt), activista de izquierdas, sino tambiÃ©n por las maniobras maquiavÃ©licas de su rival cientÃ­fico Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr), jefe de la comisiÃ³n de energÃ­a atÃ³mica, quien para desprestigiarlo filtra al FBI informaciÃ³n sobre su vida Ã­ntima o sus viejas simpatÃ­as con el comunismo. Toda una guerra sucia diseÃ±ada para restar credibilidad y fuerza al encargado del Proyecto Manhattan para el desarrollo de un arma atÃ³mica. A esas truculencias polÃ­ticas descritas con exceso de detalles, se aÃ±aden referencias a su vida privada y a sus complicadas relaciones amorosas tendientes a humanizar a un personaje de otro modo impenetrable y pÃ©treo, con reputaciÃ³n de soberbia, poseedor de intuiciones geniales y de indoblegables certezas cientÃ­ficas. Sus biÃ³grafos, ya mencionados, ven en Ã©l a una figura trÃ¡gica, al renegado poseedor de un triunfo pÃ­rrico que con clarividencia percibe y al final atestigua las devastaciones de su potente arma letal. EnigmÃ¡tica asÃ­ su conversaciÃ³n con Albert Einstein, perturbadoras las palabras socarronas de Harry Truman sobre el valor verdadero de ciertas vidas humanas. En una Ã©poca en la que el uso tendencioso de la inteligencia artificial o la inconsciencia frente a los efectos de un cambio climÃ¡tico incontrolado se yerguen como amenazas inminentes, Oppenheimer muestra ser una pelÃ­cula perspicaz e inteligente, recordatorio aleccionador de viejas catÃ¡strofes a menudo anticipadas.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Social media wags have branded today the start of “Barbenheimer Week” as two apparently hilariously different blockbusters go head to head at the box office. As one is a breezy, ruthlessly marketed family comedy and the other a doom-laden, three-hour historical drama, this was never going to be a fair fight. But the rivals do have something in common. Despite huge budgets, both have been crafted by filmmakers given plenty of wriggle room by their backers. As the nervous scientist reads a statement, flashbacks show how he came to be in charge of the The Manhattan Project, America’s secret atom bomb programme. But Nolan keeps cutting to 1958 and another hearing, this time shot in black and white, where US nuclear bigwig Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) is questioned by the Senate over his involvement with Oppenheimer ahead of Strauss’s cabinet appointment. Murphy delivers his greatest performance as the driven but tortured scientist, Florence Pugh is brilliant as his troubled on-off girlfriend, as is Emily Blunt as his equally complicated wife. Matt Damon is also excellent as a gruff General. But this is very much the director’s movie. The film never preaches or simplifies. Eye-popping cinematography conveys the terrible force of Oppenheimer’s bomb, and brilliant writing invites us to chew over the morality and consequences of its creation.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Christopher Nolan needs no introduction. He is one of cinema’s most beloved modern filmmakers, a true risk taker and visionary on all fronts. His stylistic approach is unmistakable regardless of whatever subject matter he may be exploring in his films. His twelfth feature, Oppenheimer, is no small feat. Based on the historical novel American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan’s film extensively covers the titular theoretical physicist’s scrutinized life, from the birthing of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico to the Trinity test to his public advocacy against the very weapon he fathered after witnessing its destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan at the end of World War II. Nothing is glossed over. Oppenheimer is an immense film with an even larger magnitude than almost all of Nolan’s past works. The story as we know it begins as J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) attends lectures around Europe from leading physicians, including Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer) – the Nazi physician working on their version of the atom bomb in the race against America and the allied forces. After returning to the United States, Oppenheimer sets up the first class for students to study nuclear physics. He quickly becomes a known figure and pioneer in his field, garnering the attention of the U.S. military who have already begun their quest for an all-powerful weapon to stop Hitler and end WWII. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) assigns Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project, a top-secret government effort to build the world’s first atomic bomb. To bring peace to the world, destruction is seen as a necessary evil, which heavily weighs on Oppenheimer’s own sanity and well-being.  Christopher Nolan approaches Oppenheimer’s life with an unbiased lens. Even if we are naturally empathic towards the protagonist, Nolan’s script highlights all possible angles and serves as a deep dive into Oppenheimer’s psyche. Oppenheimer’s atomic experiments put much more at risk than just the lives of a few thousand people, they could potentially spark the end of life on Earth. Nolan forces us into the same sustained sense of existential dread that Oppenheimer himself is consumed by, waiting for the inevitable and theorizing about where it could all go wrong for its entire 3-hour runtime. These extreme levels of tension are amped up further by the interrogations after the war wherein Oppenheimer’s loyalty to America is put into question. Oppenheimer goes on to oppose the development of the hydrogen bomb after WWII, making him a threat to the powers that be who seek to control an even more destructive weapon.  The scenes of Oppenheimer’s interrogation interject throughout the film, as do black-and-white segments with the commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) at his own government hearing, fracturing any sort of straightforward narrative. Nolan crafts an introspective piece that is unlike any biopic or war epic we’ve seen before. In a similar vein as Dunkirk, the past, present and future all collide, eventually revealing the greater picture as Nolan smoothly rounds things out with an incredible, bone-chilling ending that is bound to leave many viewers speechless. Mandalorian and Black Panther composer Ludwig Göransson reunites with Christopher Nolan here after scoring Tenet and crafts a pulsating musical backbone to Oppenheimer that is critical in creating an immersive experience. Every sonic queue and every instrument is utilized to get the most emotion out of the audience. Additionally, the sound design is a big upgrade from Tenet, overstimulating and awe-inducing til the very end. Adding to the grandeur is cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Nope, Interstellar) with his towering and impactful visuals. Practically every shot has a vivid purpose and is beautifully framed in IMAX 65mm and Panavision 65mm for more intimate scenes, as well as specially crafted black-and-white IMAX film for specific portions of the movie. Hoytema captures the sheer intensity of the operation at hand, while also taking time to lens the deeply complex emotions of Oppenheimer’s unwanted god complex.  Jennifer Lame (Hereditary, Marriage Story) will go down as one of the finest editors of the decade for her work here. Oppenheimer is paced at a breakneck speed, which is quite praiseworthy given all the nonlinear plot threads. The constant inter-splicing of Oppenheimer’s visions of atoms colliding is genius, fracturing his reality as it shapes into how it is now told in the history books. This opens up a pathway into the mind of the scientist but also acts as a tension builder given how each rapid shot represents a potential catastrophe to come. Lame’s razor-sharp editing makes this 3-hour-long film an utterly captivating watch, never slowing its rhythm or losing its tight grasp on the viewer’s undivided attention. Nolan gives Lame an all but impossible task and she executes it with sheer brilliance. Getting into the star-studded cast, Oppenheimer is an expansive masterclass in acting. Leading the pack is a never-better Cillian Murphy who gives a career-defining performance as the titular character. He speaks with his eyes and more than often communicates all thoughts and devastating emotions – especially fear and anxiety – within the facial subtleties of his endless stare. Emily Blunt as his wife, Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, has her movie-stealing moment as well. Matt Damon is reliably excellent as Oppenheimer’s stern higher-up. Meanwhile, Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock is a smaller presence but has some striking scenes. Jack Quaid, Benny Safdie, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek, Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, Olivia Thirlby, and more all get their individual share of moments to shine as well. One could go on all day as the list of actors goes on and on.  Christopher Nolan has indeed gathered a mighty ensemble to round out the film alongside Cillian Murphy’s enthralling take on Oppenheimer, but it’s Robert Downey Jr. who gives the film’s highest standout supporting performance as Lewis Strauss. Starring in almost entirely black-and-white scenes, Downey Jr. is repulsively brilliant in a role with some shocking twists, serving almost like an opposing narrative force to Murphy’s Oppenheimer. Even though the two rarely share the screen together, their oppositions are felt at every turn. And last but not least, veteran actor Tom Conti leaves a lasting impression as Albert Einstein, who shows up more than expected and has one of the most momentous and unforgettable scenes of the film. It’s hard to fathom any film this year, or anytime soon, surpassing the impact and sheer gravitas of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer. Every brush stroke propels the story forward, it’s fascinatingly dense and incredibly stimulating. It’s a film that demands to be revisited across time, as a reminder of our past. This could be Nolan’s finest masterpiece yet.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," During World War II, Lt. General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) appoints physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to work on the top-secret Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, New Mexico. Assembling a team of the brightest scientists the country has to offer, the experts spend years developing and designing the atomic bomb. When their final product is used against Japan on July 16, 1945, the world witnesses its first nuclear explosion in an event that not only ends the war, but forever changes the course of history. There has been much hype about the fact that Nolan chose to film in IMAX, but the large format feels wasted here. The visuals are far from stunning, and the film is mostly a dramatic, dialogue-heavy history lesson that’s a far cry from what I’d call “entertaining.” It’s a great movie that’s engaging, sophisticated, and intelligent, but those expecting traditional thrills are going to be greatly disappointed. Save your money, because seeing this in IMAX isn’t really worth it. Nolan’s film is poignant in a way that’s chillingly relevant. His story not only explores one of the most important figures in U.S. history, but also makes you think about the current lack of empathy that’s plaguing society. There’s a very real moral question about humanity’s ability to make something that will help save the lives of many but also result in the death of innocents, and Nolan makes a strong political statement in a surprisingly restrained manner. His commentary on the far-reaching effects of such a powerful weapon born from the intersection of innovation, science, and government, while being an invention that has changed but also endangered the world, will give you chills. Nolan’s script is terrific, and is one of my favorite screenplays of the year. Nolan tells much more of the obscure back story of Oppenheimer’s professional and personal life that few know, and it makes for a lengthy (but interesting) narrative. The film includes his ties to the Communist Party, Hoover’s FBI investigation, his tangles with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and an eventual closed-door hearing that was designed to strip him of his security clearance years after the war ended. “Oppenheimer” is a complex film that requires your full attention, with myriad characters and time jumps that will keep you on your toes. A basic knowledge of history is beneficial, but those who have only heard the name Robert Oppenheimer and are aware of the very basics (like the fact that he was involved in the creation of the atomic bomb) won’t be completely lost.  In addition to complicated discussions of quantum physics, there are weighty themes about the dangers of government bureaucracy and the moral and ethical implications of creating a weapon of mass destruction. Nolan isn’t the type of storyteller who is keen on hand holding, and it’s refreshing to see a riveting movie that’s made for thinking audiences.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Con “Oppenheimer”, Christopher Nolan parece haber llegado a algún tipo de culminación de todo lo que ha hecho con sus películas anteriores —en general para bien, pero ligeramente para mal, también. Lo que tenemos aquí es una cinta que lidia con todas las obsesiones que han estado atormentando a Nolan por un buen tiempo—especialmente las relacionadas al concepto del tiempo—, pero “Oppenheimer” también es un biopic poco común, más interesado en las consecuencias de las acciones de su protagonista, que en una exploración detallada de sus motivaciones. Es por eso que la última escena —la cual no “spoilearé”, no se preocupen— es de las más poderosas, y es por eso también que uno se puede llegar a sentir un poco alejado de este personaje. El infravalorado Cillian Murphy interpreta a J. Robert Oppenheimer, el llamado “padre de la bomba atómica”; un físico que desde joven se vio atormentado por visiones de un mundo cuántico y que, a pesar de no ser particularmente brillante en un laboratorio, estaba muy interesado en el lado académico y teórico de la física. “Oppenheimer” es presentada a través de tres líneas narrativas entrelazadas: en la primera, vemos a Oppenheimer involucrándose en el Proyecto Manhattan durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el cual culmina en la prueba Trinity en medio del desierto norteamericano. En la segunda, lo vemos siendo interrogado algunos años después —el gobierno de su país, después de todo, sospecha de que mantiene algún tipo de vínculo con los comunistas. Y finalmente, tenemos un proceso judicial que involucra a Lewis Strauss (un excelente Robert Downey Jr.), lo más cercano a un enemigo que Oppenheimer tuvo durante su carrera científica. Es así que nos damos cuenta desde un inicio que Nolan está jugando con el tiempo, como suele hacerlo en buena parte de sus películas. Esta estructura, atípica para un biopic, le permite a la cinta sentirse menos convencional que el exponente promedio, haciendo que el espectador entienda algunos aspectos de la vida de Oppenheimer a la hora de enlazar ciertos eventos del pasado con otros del presente. La mayoría de escenas de “Oppenheimer” están protagonizadas por el personaje del título, e incluso al usar aquellas en donde no aparece, Nolan hace un buen trabajo escondiéndole información al espectador —es así que muchos personajes están uno o dos pasos adelante de la audiencia. Consideren sino una escena particularmente importante entre “Oppie” y Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), cuyo verdadero significado es recién revelado al final de la historia. Nolan ya ha declarado que las escenas a color —la mayoría protagonizadas por Oppenheimer— pueden ser consideradas como subjetivas mientras que las secuencias en blanco y negro —la mayoría relacionadas al proceso judicial con Strauss— son objetivas. Esto deja muy en claro que la experiencia que uno tiene al ver “Oppenheimer” está muy relacionada a lo que su protagonista percibe. Esto se hace particularmente evidente durante dos momentos en lo que Nolan retrata la ansiedad de Oppie a través de fondos desenfocados que comienzan a temblar detrás de él. Se trata de un recurso sencillo pero visualmente inventivo, que le permite a uno empatizar, aunque sea brevemente, con el protagonista, y entender lo verdaderamente culpable que se siente por la manera en que su creación está siendo utilizada. El resto del filme, no obstante, no siempre hace tan buen trabajo al ponernos en los zapatos de Oppenheimer. Nolan, por ejemplo, intenta incluir momentos más relacionados a su vida privada o amorosa, muchos de ellos protagonizados por él y por su esposa, Kitty (Emily Blunt), o su amante, la joven comunista Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Estas escenas son las menos interesantes de la película, y de hecho se sienten como un “extra” —como algo que Nolan se vio obligado a incluir, pero que no está suficientemente bien desarrollado. “Miss Flo”, en particular, está desperdiciada en un rol que no aprovecha tan bien sus considerables talentos. Y aunque Blunt tampoco tiene mucho qué hacer, al menos destaca en una escena climática, en la que Kitty demuestra ser una mujer particularmente astuta y perspicaz. Vale la pena mencionar, también, que “Oppenheimer” se siente como una cinta épica de antaño, enfocada en una historia real protagonizada por gente real, y de larga duración. Las tres horas de “Oppenheimer” no me cansaron, felizmente, pero sí se puede argumentar que la estructura de la película es un poco irregular. La secuencia de la prueba Trinity, por ejemplo, es de lo mejor que la película tiene para ofrecer —tensa, audiovisualmente magnífica, y hasta perturbadora. Pero a pesar de sentirse como el clímax natural de “Oppenheimer”, la película continua por una hora más, lo cual podría terminar por cansar a ciertos espectadores. Dicha hora final cuenta con momentos destacables —como la escena ya mencionada con la Kitty de Blunt—, pero no puedo evitar sentir que fue desarrollada más como una suerte de coa, que como una conclusión natural. Del reparto no tengo queja alguna. A Cillian Murphy ya se le está mencionando como un potencial candidato al Premio de la Academia, y con justa razón. Su J. Robert Oppenheimer, delgadísimo y muy serio, es un hombre atormentado por visiones e ideas del fin del mundo. Se trata de alguien que siempre estuvo más interesado en la ciencia que en otra cosa, y que poco a poco va sintiendo más y más culpa por la manera en que su invención está siendo usada. Es un hombre brillante, pero también complejo, de tendencias políticas de izquierda, mucho interés en relaciones amorosas, y un ego relativamente inflado (y con justa razón). Murphy lo interpreta magníficamente, con miradas intensas y un lenguaje corporal bien cuidado, convirtiéndolo en un protagonista con el que a veces resulta difícil empatizar, pero que nunca deja de ser fascinante. El reparto secundario está repleto de figuras hollywoodenses famosas, algunas con papeles enanos, casi cameos —se nota que a estas alturas del partido, casi nadie es capaz de decir que no a Nolan. Matt Damon es de los más destacables, interpretando al Coronel Leslie Grove, la persona que recluta a Oppenheimer para trabajar en el proyecto Manhattan. Como ya he mencionado, Emily Blunt y Florence Pugh están un poco desperdiciadas como la esposa y la amante de ‘Oppie’, respectivamente. Robert Downey Jr. nos entrega su mejor interpretación post-Marvel como Lewis Strauss —un hombre astuto pero muy vengativo. El gran Alden Ehrenreich (“Han Solo: una historia de Star Wars”), como un asistente de Strauss, sigue con su gira de redención, al igual que Josh Hartnett (como Ernest Lawrence, colega de Oppenheimer). Y Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine y David Dustmanlchian regresan luego de haber trabajado con Nolan en algunas de sus películas previas. (Además, “Oppenheimer” cuenta con un par de cameos inesperados, los cuales no pienso revelar). Pero como se dio a entender líneas arriba, lo más impresionante de “Oppenheimer” —por más de que no la considere como una de las mejores película de Nolan— es que representa un momento de maduración para el director británico. Alejándose del cine de acción y/o ciencia ficción, el filme desarrolla una historia compleja y por momentos espeluznante. Debo admitir que me dejó frío, y que ciertamente no me impactó tanto como a otros espectadores (especialmente a nivel emocional). Pero al menos a nivel intelectual, “Oppenheimer” es de las experiencias más estimulantes que uno puede tener en una sala de cine hoy en día. Eso sí, me hubiese encantado conectar más con su protagonista y sus ansiedades —tener más escenas como las del discurso en la universidad, o como la última, o hasta como la de la prueba Trinity, en donde uno realmente llega a sentir terror por el poder de la bomba y la manera en que podría ser utilizada en el mundo. “Oppenheimer” es una película que me resulta muy fácil admirar, pero que me dejó sintiendo muy poco. Lo cual, obviamente, variará de espectador a espectador. Porque si hay algo que no se puede negar, es que “Oppenheimer” es un filme expertamente realizado, en donde todo aspecto formal —desde las actuaciones, hasta la hipnotizante banda sonora de Ludwig Göransson, la dirección de fotografía naturalista de Hoyte Van Hoytema, y la precisa edición de Jennifer Lame— confabulan para contar una historia potente e interesante. Puede que ciertos personajes —especialmente los femeninos— estén mal desarrollados, o que la estructura de la cinta sea irregular, o que mucho de lo que sucede después de la prueba Trinity se sienta ligeramente anticlimático. Pero en general, “Oppenheimer” termina siendo una experiencia ambiciosa y compleja y muy diferente a lo que suele estrenarse en cines hoy en día. El hecho, además, de que esté siendo un éxito de taquilla —junto a la excelente “Barbie”— no hace más que darme esperanzas de que la experiencia de ir al cine por fin está de regreso. Gracias, Christopher Nolan y Greta Gerwig.",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," Filmmaker Christopher Nolan opens his latest cinematic epic, Oppenheimer, with the infamous quote from the Bhagavad Gita. Having come to be closely associated with the ‘father of the atomic bomb’, the weighty phrase truly sets the tone for this riveting and layered look at J. Robert Oppenheimer and the physicist’s life before and after leading the world-altering Manhattan Project. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film tracks the infamous scientist (portrayed by Cillian Murphy) from his days at Harvard, Cambridge and Göttingen – meeting great minds like Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Werner Heisenberg – to his winning of the Enrico Fermi Award in the final few years of his life. Not content to produce a simple biopic of the man, Nolan spends the majority of the film jumping back and forth between the race against the clock to develop the atomic bomb ahead of the Axis powers during World War II and the Red Scare politics of the Cold War. In the former, Oppenheimer is tapped to head up the entire project devoted to building the world’s first nuclear weapon by General Groves (Matt Damon), in the latter, the ‘hero’ of WWII is forced to fight to retain his government security clearance in the face of accusations of disloyalty and in light of his past association with card-carrying members of the Communist Party. Perhaps most impressively, the film manages to bombard us with the inner workings of the theoretical physicist’s mind without ever truly giving the man away. His reasoning and his motivations seem crystal clear but also mired in uncertainty. In Murphy, the filmmaker has found his perfect Oppenheimer. Marking their fourth major collaboration (after Batman Begins, Inception and Dunkirk), the Irish actor embodies the physicist as if he was born to play the role. He captures the historic figure’s manic genius and hits all the right notes on his charm, his womanizing, and his frustratingly opaque convictions. When one of Oppenheimer’s fellow scientists, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), bemoans the leader’s lack of transparency of thought, it’s hard not to vehemently nod in agreement. But perhaps that’s what makes the man so fascinating, and exactly why he remains ripe for exploration more than half a century after his passing. Though some may see the film’s runtime as excessive, Nolan earns almost every moment both with Murphy at the forefront and with help from the talented team he’s assembled both in front of and behind the camera. Murphy is supported by a stellar group of actors at the top of their game, including particularly impressive turns from Safdie, Robert Downey Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, David Krumholtz, and Jason Clarke. Downey Jr. – clearly having an absolute blast as Lewis Strauss (pun intended) – looks to be a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod come Oscar season, as does Murphy for his lead performance. Hoyte van Hoytema’s camera provides Oppenheimer’s epic scale, lingering on the vistas of New Mexico, the holocausts within an atomic chain reaction, and the subtle emotion in Murphy’s ridiculously expressive eyes. Meanwhile, Ludwig Göransson’s score and the film’s sound design perfectly underscore the suspense, crawling under the skin of the audience and pushing the narrative inexorably forward. The combination of all three leads to a veritable cinematic feast for the senses, unlike anything else film-goers will have experienced this year. If the film has a noticeable flaw, it comes in how the film treats the main women in Oppenheimer’s life. Emily Blunt (as Kitty Puening) and Florence Pugh (as Jean Tatlock) both turn in strong and memorable performances, but their parts feel largely underwritten compared to their male cinematic counterparts. Though character motivations are kept deliberately murky throughout, regardless of gender, there are some essential pieces to both Kitty and Jean that feel more like forgotten gaps than purposeful puzzles. Given the film clocks in at 180 minutes, it seems as if there could’ve been a few more minutes devoted to the women to allow for a deeper understanding of both. That said, in delving into the history of this incredibly complicated figure, Oppenheimer forces us to confront some of recent history’s greatest moral questions, and with them, our biggest failings. Not just with the ethics of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear deterents, but in how we deal with differences of personality, and of thought and politics. As our contemporary world barrels both toward unprecedented change but also looks to regress to the politics of fear and division that marred the mid-20th century, it also makes us look far more intimately at ourselves and reflect on the kind of world we truly want to inhabit. It’s no secret that many critics held up Oppenheimer as the prestige picture to beat this year, with article after article filled with lofty expectations of both Nolan and the film as a whole. What’s perhaps more surprising is that not only has the film met most of those expectations, but it’s possibly even exceeded them. Through powerful performances, filmmakers at the top of their game, and well-timed greater ethical conversations, Oppenheimer has not only become the film to beat this year, but of many years to come.

"Jul 23, 2023"," One might assume that a film titled Oppenheimer would center largely on the creation of the superweapon that brought about the end of World War II, and although this assumption would be correct, one might find themselves ill-prepared for just how much of Christopher Nolan’s latest film is not about that particular sequence of events. That’s not to say significant screentime isn’t devoted to the Manhattan Project — the construction of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the assembling of the best physicists in the world, and the ever-mounting pressure of trying to beat the enemy to the finish line is all here — but Nolan is equally fascinated with later events in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed here by Cillian Murphy in the most captivating performance of his career.  Those post-war events include a 1954 security clearance hearing, where a hand-picked panel of political hitmen dissect decades of Oppenheimer’s relationships and decisions in a transparent effort to discredit and humiliate him; while a certain former President of the United States frequently shouts into the echo chamber about witch hunts, he and his followers might be well-served by brushing up on their history to see what this actually looks like in practice, and the kangaroo court proceedings to which Oppenheimer was subjected stand as a textbook example.  Based on the non-fiction tome American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Nolan’s screenplay attempts to distill the staggering volume of information in Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography into these three segments of Oppenheimer‘s life, flitting from timeline to timeline in a way that feels haphazard at first, but pays dividends in the film’s final act by finding an emotional throughline in these seemingly disparate narratives. Some moviegoers have groused that Nolan’s penchant for nonlinear storytelling is a particular disservice here, but I would argue that arranging these same sequences in chronological order would blunt the impact of all three.  If there’s any disservice to be found here, it would be the film’s audio mix, which once again allows the score to overpower the dialogue. While not as egregiously imbalanced as Tenet, it still marks the continuation of a frustrating habit, and audiences experiencing the film in a theater with subpar sound equipment or poor acoustics will have their patience stretched to the limit. Equally vexing is Nolan’s apparent disinterest in writing complex female characters, a criticism that has plagued the celebrated director for years; Florence Pugh (as Oppenheimer’s lover, Jean Tatloc) and Emily Blunt (as his wife, Kitty) are given little to do except berate the protagonist for remaining stoic in the face of whatever adversity looms on the horizon. In the case of the former, it’s his decision to cut ties as he focuses on his work at Los Alamos and tries to be a better father and husband; in the latter scenario, it’s Oppenheimer’s refusal to fight back against the underhanded tactics deployed in the security clearance hearing that earns him Kitty’s ire. This does lead to an especially memorable moment, an all-too-brief scene in which Kitty is questioned by the committee, and Blunt knocks it out of the park. It’s a shame Pugh wasn’t given a similar opportunity to shine.  Thematically, Oppenheimer is arguably one of Nolan’s most complex achievements, a haunting portrait of a man whose unquenchable thirst to understand the fabric of the universe led to the creation of the very thing most likely to bring about its demise. “I don’t know if we can be trusted with such a weapon,” Oppenheimer tells a fellow physicist at one point. “But I know the Nazis can’t. We have no choice.” That singular belief, and the decisions made because of it, would bring about irrevocable changes that still reverberate today, and Nolan’s latest work arriving at a time when fear of nuclear destruction is at the highest level since the Cold War feels as poignant and darkly poetic as the work itself.

"Jul 23, 2023"," This kind of thing didn’t used to be such a big deal. Fifteen years ago, “The Dark Knight” and “Mamma Mia!” both opened on July 18, and I don’t remember anyone making any memes about it. (I’m not sure we even had memes yet. We were all still on MySpace back then.) But this summer, “Barbenheimer” fever has been sweeping the nation, with people captivated by the apparently astounding novelty of two movies aimed at different audiences being released the same day. I suppose it is amusing to imagine Greta Gerwig’s sassy, self-aware toy story in competition with Christopher Nolan’s doomy World War II docudrama. But the sad truth is that Hollywood used to put out pictures like “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” all the time. In fact, there used to be a wide variety of movies in multiplexes appealing to all sorts of demographics instead of just super-expensive sequels and remakes targeted at 40-year-old teenage boys. That “Barbenheimer” has become such a popular phenomenon is a rebuke to the sorely limited menu we’ve been served since the blockbuster fracking of the film industry. The fact that people are this excited speaks to a hunger Hollywood should heed. And boy howdy, are folks fired up. On Tuesday afternoon, I talked to the Coolidge Corner Theatre’s deputy director Beth Gilligan, who told me that in her 14 years at the cinema, she’s never seen presales like this. They’re used to selling maybe 100 seats or so in advance before opening a hotly anticipated title. At the time we spoke, they’d already sold more than 3,000 tickets for “Barbie” and almost 2,100 for their 70mm engagement of “Oppenheimer.” With most of the weekend sold out, the Coolidge has added additional late shows of “Barbie” to try and keep up with demand, along with a pink carpet premiere and after-party on opening night. Other local cinemas are also getting into the “Barbenheimer” spirit, as the Somerville Theatre and Arlington Capitol are offering free popcorn for folks who come to see both films. Even Tom Cruise, the President of movies, posted pictures of himself buying tickets for “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer,” announcing plans to see them as a double feature on opening day. (I adore his enthusiasm, but seriously can’t imagine Cruise sitting still for five hours. Maybe the theater will let him bring in a treadmill?) Gilligan thinks “Barbenheimer” is a great thing for movie culture, and I’m inclined to agree. Theaters still haven’t fully rebounded from the pandemic, and the summer’s sorry lineup of underperforming sequels hasn’t exactly captured the public’s imagination. (Even the excellent “Mission: Impossible” is doing disappointing numbers.) “It’s so nice to hear people excited about coming to the movies again,” she says, noting that these two big-budget studio pictures are also interesting, idiosyncratic films made by directors who started out with indies that played the Coolidge. However disparate in content and tone — my goodness, I do not recommend trying to do them as a double feature no matter what Tom Cruise says — “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” are both distinctive visions from serious filmmakers who have a lot on their minds. You can wait all summer for a blockbuster that’s actually about something, and here come two on the same day. “Overwhelmed with ideas” is not a complaint I ever expected to have about a movie made by Mattel. But Gerwig’s playfully meta take on America’s most loved (and loathed) feminine icon tries to tackle every argument that’s ever been had about Barbie’s influence on American culture, along with quite a bit of contemporary gender theory, too many inside jokes for the terminally online, plus a few fantastic song and dance numbers. (I liked those the best.) “Barbie” is a crazily ambitious movie, and for the first half-hour or so, I thought I might be watching a masterpiece. It’s akin to Robert Altman’s “Popeye” in the sheer, stylized strangeness of its vision of Barbie Land — a two-dimensional, plastic paradise where all the dream houses are cut-out dioramas and human dolls drive miniature cars and pantomime drinking out of empty cups. Played by an incandescent Margot Robbie, our Barbie finds herself suddenly and inexplicably troubled by thoughts about death. Her existential crisis manifests itself in physical imperfections like cellulite and flat feet, sending the character on a convoluted quest to contemporary Los Angeles accompanied by Ryan Gosling’s gloriously dimwitted Ken. The more the movie tries to explain itself, the less sense it makes. Don't think too hard. It’s more fun to marvel at the eye-popping production design, and the ferociously committed turns from these two leads. Gosling is probably going to get more attention — his himbo timing is immaculate and his dancing has improved significantly since “La La Land” — but I found Robbie’s performance unexpectedly affecting. She never condescends to the character or acts like she’s in on a joke. The movie sometimes gets a little too impressed with itself, but the actress never does. “Barbie” bites off more than it can chew, yet only nibbles the hand that feeds. However didactic it wants to be about dismantling the patriarchy, at the end of the day, this is still a two-hour toy commercial. Gerwig’s luminous 2019 adaptation of “Little Women” brilliantly threaded the needle of giving Jo the ending she deserved without betraying the book, but she can’t quite pull off the same miracle here. Still, she comes closer than anyone had a right to expect from a project with such icky corporate origins. (A recent New Yorker article about Mattel’s cinematic ambitions is one of the most dystopian things I’ve ever read.) Gerwig also gets bonus points for a joke about men explaining “The Godfather” to their girlfriends that hit so close to home I felt personally wounded. Christopher Nolan is our poet laureate of logistics. He loves making movies about intricate problem-solving systems, so the Manhattan Project would seem like a natural subject for the “Dunkirk” director. Yet I was still unprepared for the ferocity and compelling oddity of his “Oppenheimer.” Adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 bestseller “American Prometheus,” the movie rockets through its three-hour running time like an only slightly less deranged version of a “JFK” or “Nixon”-era Oliver Stone picture — with similarly frantic, black-and-white cross-cutting, a cast of famous faces and a headlong momentum careening into one of history’s darkest hours. Cillian Murphy plays “the father of the atomic bomb” with magnetic, arrogant unknowability, only considering the consequences of his actions long after the fact. As is his custom, Nolan entwines three different timelines, running Oppenheimer’s breakthroughs at Los Alamos concurrently with his downfall at the hands of the HUAC stooges and the eventual aftermath. (If you love committee meetings, have I got a film for you.) The film is stacked with all your favorite character actors — nearly every pasty-looking guy in Hollywood shows up here somewhere. It also boasts a splendid comeback turn from Robert Downey Jr. playing the seethingly jealous Admiral Lewis Strauss as Salieri to Oppenheimer’s Mozart. He’s stripped away all his fast-talking charm, finding registers we’ve never seen from him before. Matt Damon is his rock-solid, reliable self as General Leslie Groves, and by now, you’ve got to respect the guy’s commitment to starring in every movie your dad wants to see. So much of “Oppenheimer” consists of drably dressed men shouting at one another in cramped rooms, yet Nolan remains an irrepressible showman, shooting on large format film with crazed cuts to churning, subatomic reactions and wild, hallucinatory interludes. (A nude Florence Pugh holding up a Sanskrit copy of the Bhagavad Gita during sex might as well be borrowed from Stone’s goofy glory days.) It is a work of profound moral seriousness yet also shamelessly entertaining. It probably sounds strange to say that I had a great time at “Oppenheimer,” but I left the theater electrified and energized by the filmmaking, thinking about a line from another Christopher Nolan film released 15 years ago this week: “Either you die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.” ""Barbie"" and ""Oppenheimer"" open in theaters Friday, July 21. ""Oppenheimer"" is being released in multiple formats, including digital, IMAX and 70mm film. The 70mm press screening held at the AMC Boston Common was a technical disaster from which I would have walked out had I not been on deadline. I’m very much looking forward to seeing a proper 70mm presentation at the Somerville Theatre or at the Coolidge over the weekend.

"Jul 23, 2023"," Oppenheimer no tanto comienza como más bien estalla con la fuerza de una supernova, impulsada por la amalgama de sus mayores virtudes cinematográficas: la extraordinaria y opresiva banda sonora de Ludwig Göransson, que prácticamente no deja de escucharse a lo largo de las tres horas de duración; las alucinantes reacciones subatómicas y astronómicas -creadas sin gráficas computarizadas- que parecen reducir al espectador microscópicamente ante la inmensidad de la pantalla IMAX, formato de predilección del cineasta británico; la diestra edición de Jennifer Lame, quizá la persona más integral a la efectividad del filme, pues recae en ella llevar el frenético compás; la sobrehumana interpretación de Cillian Murphy, capaz de expresar toda la gama de contradicciones de su histórico papel a través de su taciturno y desencajado semblante, captado con apabullante intensidad -casi siempre en primer plano- por el renombrado cinematógrafo Hoyte van Hoytema; y, por supuesto, la exacta dirección de Nolan, así como su denso libreto, brillantemente estructurado alrededor de su musa perenne, los desplazamientos temporales.  Los primeros minutos del filme son absolutamente sobrecogedores, un deslumbrante preámbulo a base de shock dirigido a introducir al público en la psiquis del protagonista y prepararlo para todo lo que experimentará después. Como J. Robert Oppenheimer, el llamado “padre de la bomba atómica”, Murphy lidera un elenco excepcional en el que ningún papel es demasiado pequeño y la inmensa mayoría deja una gran impresión. Son demasiados los nombres, pero cabe destacar a Tom Conti como Albert Einstein, David Krumholtz como Isidor Rabi, Josh Harnett como Ernest Lawrence y Kenneth Branagh como Niels Bohr. Y esos son solo los científicos. También tenemos a Matt Damon como el general Leslie Groves y Gary Oldman como el presidente Harry Truman, cuya presencia evoca su participación en otra película no muy disímil a esta, tanto en tono como en metodología: la estupenda JFK, de Oliver Stone, que tampoco fue nada convencional en su acercamiento al material.  En el papel -y en cualquier otras manos- Oppenheimer pudo haber acabado como otro biopic común y corriente acerca de una de las mentes más brillantes del siglo 20 en la misma trillada vena de algo como A Beautiful Mind o The Imitation Game. Nolan conquista el biopic adaptando a la pantalla grande la biografía del controvertible físico estadounidense (titulada American Prometheus, coescrita por Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin) con partes iguales de asombro y conmoción, fascinado por todo el aspecto científico que condujo a la construcción de esta arma de destrucción masiva, y horrorizado por sus inimaginables consecuencias. El director de Memento divide su narrativa en dos tiempos: uno, titulado “Fission”, filmado a color desde la perspectiva de Oppenheimer, abarcando desde sus años universitarios hasta su persecución durante la era del macartismo en Estados Unidos; y el segundo, titulado “Fusion”, filmado en glorioso blanco y negro, y enfocado en la figura de Lewis Strauss (un impresionante Robert Downey Jr., finalmente despojado de todos los manierismos de “Tony Stark”), el expresidente de la Comisión de Energía Atómica, que a finales de la década de 1950 aspiraba a un puesto en el gabinete de Dwight D. Eisenhower.  La relación entre ambos hombres es lentamente revelada a medida que avanzamos en las dos vertientes. La primera, la principal, parte de los recuerdos de un Oppenheimer más mayor mientras es interrogado por un panel de militares y políticos comprometidos con revocarle sus permisos de seguridad por viejos vínculos con conocidos comunistas, entre ellos su esposa (Emily Blunt). Vemos cómo el físico pasó de ser un respetado profesor en la Universidad de Berkeley, a ser escogido para liderar el Manhattan Project con el fin de fabricar una bomba atómica antes que los nazis. “No sé si se nos puede confiar esta arma, pero sé que no se puede confiar en los nazis”, asevera Oppenheimer, con considerable ingenuidad, como descubrió tan pronto  Alemania se rindió y esto no detuvo los destructivos planes del ejército estadounidense. Nolan dirige toda esta sección del argumento con un cautivante sentido de urgencia, culminando con el infame Trinity Test en un estruendoso estallido de luz cegadora que sacudió las butacas del cine , y el cual nos lleva al último tercio de la historia que desea contar, uno que resulta más sosegado en comparación, pero no menos interesante.  Dice mucho de los horrores apocalípticos recreados en pantalla que su escena más escalofriante no sea la de la prueba de la primera bomba atómica, sino la que gira en torno a los hombres que decidieron cómo y cuándo usarla con perturbadora frialdad. “No ataquemos a Kyoto. Es una ciudad preciosa, con gran valor histórico. Además, mi esposa y yo pasamos nuestra luna de miel ahí”, expresa entre risas el secretario de guerra de Estados Unidos, con la misma despreocupación que alguien escoge en un mapa dónde ir a vacacionar. Si algo se le pudiera señalar al largometraje, es cómo pierde fuerza durante su última hora mientras se explican los vínculos entre Oppenheimer y Strauss a través de vistas senatoriales e interrogatorios. Sin embargo, este tercer acto es quizá el más esencial, pues en él somos testigos de los efectos de su creación en la vida del científico, el perdón que lo eludió hasta su muerte, no solo por lo que hizo, sino por lo que desató en el mundo. El contundente peso de sus acciones cae con un aplomo aterrador en las líneas finales. La relación entre Einstein y Oppenheimer -incluso por más limitado que sea el tiempo que se le dedica- acaba siendo más significativa y estrecha que la del físico con su esposa y su amante, interpretada por Florence Pugh (el fuerte de Nolan jamás ha sido escribir papeles femeninos, mucho menos relaciones sentimentales, y esta no es la excepción). Las palabras que intercambian no solo trazan una conexión directa entre el pasado y el presente, sino que se hacen eco de advertencias contemporáneas hechas por otros Prometeos modernos acerca de las serias amenazas que actualmente atentan contra el futuro de nuestra especie. La trágica certeza de que estas están cayendo en los mismos oídos sordos que cayeron las que hizo Oppenheimer tras la detonación de las bombas en Hiroshima y Nagasaki, solo hace el desenlace de este imponente largometraje aún más desconcertante.  Magnífica reseña. La lectura del libro añade datos importantes sobre la personalidad del protagonista que arrojan luz sobre su ulterior comportamiento  y hubiesen ampliado el efecto dramático del film. Me refiero (entre otros) a la manzana “envenenada” de sus años estudiantiles.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023"," For the first time in years, blockbuster season hasn’t been dominated by superheroes. Instead, the summer belongs to two very different movies, one of which marks the return of Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer finds itself going up against Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, which has the same release date. The contrast has inspired an unofficial double bill fans have nicknamed “Barbenheimer,” where fans will watch both films in one day.  Beneath the hype is the return of one of cinema’s most influential filmmakers, telling a story that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen. Based on the biography American Prometheus, the film is the story of Robert J Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), known to history as “The Father of The Atomic Bomb”. The film recreates his pivotal work on The Manhattan Project during World War II, the project that drove him to create the bomb before the Nazis, as well as the consequences of his creation.  Oppenheimer is one of his most spectacular films to date. For a movie of this scale, intelligence, and maturity to be released in the middle of summer is something we just don’t see anymore, and the director ensures that it is every bit as fulfilling as the action movies it is up against. Weaving two timelines together, one black and white and one colour, it’s a study of both the man behind the bomb and society as a whole.  The script questions whether scientists are responsible for the way their discoveries are used, and how (particularly in a time of peril) the term patriotism is as much of a warning as it is an ideal. After pondering the nature of time, space, and physics, Nolan delves into morality more than he has done with other recent work. He has assembled an extraordinary cast to deliver that objective, spearheaded by the masterful Murphy.  His role here couldn’t be further from Peaky Blinders’ Thomas Shelby, but there are shades of what made that character so effective: Murphy’s intensity, the weight with which each line is delivered, is essential in such a dialogue heavy film. The surprise package is Robert Downey JR as Lewis Strauss, a member of the Atomic Energy Commission and an opponent of sorts to Oppenheimer.  After fifteen years of Tony Stark, it’s easy to forget that these films are where the actor made his comeback: Zodiac, A Scanner Darkly, and Good Night and Good Luck showcased him as a standout support actor. Here, older and with more authority, he glides into such a prominent role with ease and becomes one of the star players in the ensemble. Matt Damon also shines as Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, while Emily Blunt becomes more significant as the film progresses playing Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty.  After all the memes and hype, Oppenheimer proves to be the real deal. A film that will be remembered and discussed long after its cinema run, Christopher Nolan’s 12th film proves the filmmaker has no intention of slowing down.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023",This is an old-school movie designed to make you think&#44; and it succeeds&#44; to the frustration of those who already suffer from insomnia and existential dread&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023"," It’s billed as a biopic of theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed the “father of the atomic bomb”. But “biopic” seems too small a word to contain the ambition and scope of Christopher Nolan’s formidable if occasionally unwieldy latest. Oppenheimer is a dense and intricate period piece, playing out in a tangle of timelines. It weaves together courtroom drama, romantic liaisons, laboratory epiphanies and lecture hall personality cults. But perhaps more than all of this, Oppenheimer is the ultimate monster movie. Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer is an atomic-age Frankenstein, a man captivated by the boundless possibilities of science, realising too late that his creation has a limitless capacity for destruction. Ultimately, however, the monster in this story is not Oppenheimer’s invention but the appetite for annihilation that it unleashes in mankind. It’s a realisation that plays out, inexorably, in Oppenheimer’s hollow, haunted face as the film unfolds. Murphy’s far-seeing ice-chip eyes have never been put to better use. In fact, Murphy’s physicality as a whole is one of the most potent weapons at the film’s disposal. He seems impossibly slight, a theoretical idea of a man in contrast to the robust certainties of the military figures he works alongside (Matt Damon’s Lt Gen Leslie Groves, for example, is bullish and solid, a clenched fist looking for something to punch). In one shot we see Oppenheimer hauling an armful of books into a new classroom, and it looks as though he’s buckling under the weight of his accumulated knowledge. At other times he’s calm and glassily composed, somehow removed from jostling egos and the fusion of ideas that will take shape into the ultimate weapon. The version of Oppenheimer that we see on screen at any given time is a marker, an indication of which timeline we are currently inhabiting. Insights into his stellar early academic career are punctuated by glimpses of a later humiliating security clearance hearing that picked over every aspect of his life; the development of the bomb – the so-called Manhattan Project – is cut together with another hearing, this time in the Senate, to establish whether Oppenheimer’s former colleague Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, excellent) should be appointed in a federal government role. It’s a knotty mesh of a structure. Time in Oppenheimer doesn’t feel entirely linear – there are moments, in particular a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein, that seem unmoored from the rest of the film. Nolan’s films frequently require a couple of viewings to unravel fully, and while it lacks the baffle-factor of Tenet, Oppenheimer is no exception. There are other problems: the cursory treatment of the female characters is one. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock, gets short shrift. And Emily Blunt, as J Robert’s wife Kitty Oppenheimer, spends much of the first two hours mutinously clutching a martini on the edge of the frame. She does, however, claim a couple of terrific moments later on: a skin-flaying interrogation scene; a wordless glare that conveys the full nuclear winter of her animosity towards a disloyal colleague. But, for the most part, the film is a towering achievement. Not surprisingly, given Nolan’s preference for shooting on Imax 70mm film, the picture has a depth of detail you could drown in. There’s no shortage of scenes of furious blackboard scribbling, the accepted cinematic signifier of scientific genius. But more interesting are the abstract moments; it’s as though we are venturing into the heart of the atom itself. Equally inventive is the way the sets seem to quake at moments of tension. Oppenheimer’s world is literally rocked by the shockwaves of the reaction that has been set in motion. Most effective, however, is the use of sound and music. Like Jonathan Glazer’s upcoming The Zone of Interest, this is a film in which the horrors of war are not shown but conveyed inescapably through what we hear. Ludwig Göransson’s score is masterful and mercurial, surely one of the finest of the year. And there’s a recurring motif in the soundscape, a crescendo of thunderously stamping feet. It’s taken from a moment of triumph and glory, the high point of Oppenheimer’s career. But it takes on a mounting sense of threat with each use, as the catastrophic potential of the physicist’s work becomes clear.",POSITIVE
"Jul 23, 2023"," Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to buckle up and get ready for the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise -  Dead Reckoning Part One (such a long title…) and it’s a mission you should seriously consider accepting. 2018’s Fallout was a sensational action movie that continued the series’ upwards trajectory, as well as Tom Cruise’s insistence on pushing the boundaries of stuntwork and spectacle, and Dead Reckoning wasn’t about to put the brakes on the momentum. Now, Dead Reckoning doesn’t quite top Fallout, however, it’s still an energy-fuelled romp that feels big in every way - except the frustratingly rudimental dialogue throughout. Whilst the story itself is fairly standard, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is tasked with hunting down a MacGuffin to prevent it falling into the wrong hands - which, in this case, is pretty much everyone's - and he embarks on a worldwide adventure with the help of old allies and new, frostier ones - but an old enemy resurfaces to haunt Hunt once again. Dead Reckoning indeed feels grand in scope and packs a selection of excellent, pulse-thumping setpieces, but it doesn’t feel as focused as its predecessor. Certain sequences feel elongated and lack Fallout’s tight editing, which, despite the kinetic energy of what was unfolding, sometimes led to a want to simply move things along. That, combined with the incessant need to remind everybody that this mission was CRUCIAL, VITAL, and CANNOT FAIL became slightly wearisome by the end of the movie. That said, the majority of the major setpieces are fantastically choreographed and presented - from train heists to city chases, airport infiltration, and more - and McQuarrie does a solid job of creating atmosphere and mystery as the narrative unfolds around the precious item that the entire world seems to be after. Of course, the stuntwork is exemplary, with Cruise once again providing he is the man to deliver death-defying stunts for the entertainment of moviegoers the world over - I just wish the movie’s jaw-dropping major stunt had been kept under wraps to accentuate its awesomeness. Alas, marketing. As Ethan Hunt, Cruise is again assured and delivers screen presence and charisma to a level that not many others can, and his fellow cast members are mostly up to the challenge with him. Hayley Atwell matches Cruise throughout, both providing delicious chemistry with each other, whilst Pegg, Klementieff, and Ferguson are strong in their respective, and varied roles - no performance feels groundbreaking but they all feel right, it’s just a shame that they are fed weak, expository dialogue that exists simply to spoonfeed audiences that this is IMPORTANT. Whilst falling short of Fallout’s brilliance, Dead Reckoning Part One is still another strong entry into a franchise that shows no sign of abating as we roll confidently into 2024’s Dead Reckoning Part Two. Are raunchy comedies on the rise once more? Adele Lim’s Joy Ride certainly makes a case for the return of the subgenre that has been painfully lacking in output in recent years, or certainly strong efforts. Joy Ride follows four Asian-American friends, all at different stages of their lives, as they head to Asia in order for one of the squad to close a significant business deal and also to search for her birth mother, but it just isn’t going to be that easy along the way. With a majority Asian-led cast, Joy Ride is an important step forward for diversity and representation, but, alongside that, is a great comedy in its own right. In the tradition of adult comedies, Joy Ride is brash and in your face at times, and whilst the jokes don’t always hit, the performance of the ensemble elevates the movie even in its slower moments. As Audrey, Lolo, Kat, ad Deadeye, the chemistry and bond between Park, Cola, Hsu, and Wu fizzles with an authentic intensity as they flit between friendship, jealousy, camaraderie, deceit, and acceptance. Whilst Park stands out, all four are fabulous individually and help in papering over some of the movie's flaws, narratively and in its writing. I found a lot of joy in the quieter, less showy gags than the more ostentatious sequences, though there are two big sequences in particular that hit perfectly, but as with all movies like this, your tolerance and mileage may vary the wilder it gets. In amongst the chaos, Lim attempts to inject an emotional undercurrent into the girl's friendships, but more so into the search for Audrey’s birth mother, a mother that has not been present for the entirety of her life. Joy Ride does not paint Audrey’s mother as a villain or a bad person for putting her daughter up for adoption, instead using it as an emotional tide pulsing below the surface, and when it pays off, it really is quite emotional and allows Joy Ride to be more than just sex jokes and debauchery, though it thrives in those circles for the most part. It may not be perfect, but Joy Ride is a naughty little morsel that’s big on laughs and, surprisingly, emotion too. For his directorial debut, Juel Taylor decided to forego the easy route, instead opting to create a mash-up of science-fiction, mystery, comedy, and 1970s Blaxploitation to create a recipe that really shouldn’t work. However, it’s been seen before that sometimes something excellent can be conjured out of the unexpected and that can certainly be said for Netflix’s They Cloned Tyrone - an ambitious and riotous ride that combines social commentary and a good time to boot. The sharp narrative follows drug dealer Fontaine (Boyega) who runs into a spot of trouble after confronting local pimp Slick Charles (Foxx) in an attempt to recoup monies owed. Following a later unconnected altercation, Slick enlists the help of working girl Yo-Yo (Parris) to confirm that Fontaine is, well, actually Fontaine off the heels of a strangely familiar interaction between the two men. In their attempts to unravel the bizarreness of the night, the trio finds themselves embroiled in something much bigger and more nefarious than they could imagine. What occurs shouldn’t work, tonally and narratively, yet Taylor and screenwriter Rettenmeier have crafted a razor-sharp, incisive yet still unique commentary on oppression, whitewashing, and mass product marketing (to name a few…) presented in a grounded reality and conveyed with three excellent performances. The chemistry between Boyega, Foxx, and Parris is electric, and Boyega really is just so damn good here, a genuine superstar of the British acting scene. Of course, they are aided by a great script full of snappy one-liners, zinging retorts, and strong gags to nestle along the thematic elements and the more bonkers angle the movie takes the more it unravels - an angle that if you sit back and get on board with, you’ll have a blast with. Now, the movie arguably takes a little too long to reach its destination, but it's never a dull ride and when the final scene hits, it provides a terrifically satisfying (and smart) finale. Production-wise, the movie looks and feels stylish, however, the grainy filter used throughout was a bit much in this instance. Combining action, commentary, mystery, and three fabulous performances - led by Boyega - They Cloned Tyrone is an unexpectedly incisive and entertaining ride, one that should be a real win for Netflix and act as a strong calling card for Juel Taylor’s talents going forward. Swissploitation is the new exploitation! Maybe not, but Johannes Hartmann’s madcap satire Mad Heidi certainly makes a bold statement. The film begins by telling the viewer what they’re about to see was made possible by Crowdfunding, which may elicit worry in some, but by the time the credits had rolled, I still couldn’t believe this was crowdfunded, such was the high level of quality in relation to visual effects and the overall look of the film. It’s clear this was a project Hartmann felt a real passion for. The story is set in dystopian Switzerland, a country now governed by President Melli (van Dien), a fascist oppressor and owner of Melli Cheese, now the country’s only cheese supplier. When her boyfriend is executed for producing and selling black-market cheese, Heidi (Lucy) undergoes a transformation from a quiet village girl to a kick-ass warrior in order to free her country from its brutal enslavement. It’s clear to all that Alice Lucy is having a blast in the role, a role she is very good in, and the same can be said for the rest of the cast, especially Casper van Dien, that man chewed up every bit of the scenery and more. If the performances are OTT, the story and action become truly wild the further down the rabbit hole we go - it’s an exploitation film, so expect buckets of blood, nudity, dismemberment, and…cheese-related death. Honestly, there is more cheese in this film than you could throw a block of Schabziger at, and, admittedly, the cheese puns and one-liners do eventually begin to wear thin yet they remain faithful to the bonkers tone of Mad Heidi overall. Coming in at a cool ninety minutes, crucially the film does not outstay its welcome, despite cramming an awful lot into its short runtime though there were one or two noticeable lulls in the otherwise energetic pacing. Mad Heidi is a crazy film that deserves to garner a cult following, it’s bonkers, it's big, it's brash, and it’s definitely not perfect but it is a lot of fun (and who doesn’t like seeing the fascists get their comeuppance?) It’s the best day ever! Kicking off the now-legendary Barbenheimer weekend of cinema, Greta Gerwig’s much-anticipated Barbie is here, dripping with pink pomp, sparkles, and dreams. Right away, my screening was packed with people ready to gleefully absorb the experience, and Kenergy levels were high - certainly, the busiest I’ve seen a theatre since COVID times. Beginning in Barbieland, where everything is seemingly perfect, Barbie (Robbie) is whisked to the real world to repair her bond with the person who owns her doll after she begins to experience existential thoughts of death, only to find out that the real world maybe isn’t all its cracked up to be. But don’t worry, Ken (Gosling) is there for the ride, and to truly find out about the ‘wonders’ of the patriarchy. If any of that doesn’t appeal to you, switch off now as the film as a whole WILL NOT be for you. Alongside Noah Baumbach, Gerwig’s narrative focuses keenly on what it is to be a woman in society - the challenges, the pitfalls, the struggles in the face of the patriarchy - and together they have crafted a sharp screenplay that fizzles with (k)energy and emotion. Though, speaking honestly, whilst wonderfully crafted, at times the messages felt stated rather than presented as discussion pieces, and maybe too much social commentary permeated the film without drilling deeper than it could have. Whether that’s the case, Barbie is riotously entertaining and speeds along like Barbie’s pink convertible itself, the two-hour runtime feels like a breeze thanks to a constant stream of solid gags (including plenty at the expense of Mattel), well-placed musical numbers, and smart pacing - even if the final stretch did seem to be just that, a little stretched. The film does start off on rockier ground in terms of its overall humour but quickly finds its footing as we flit between Barbieland and the real world focusing on our two stars, both of whom are so so good. Margot Robbie is the perfect Barbie, and the film humorously nods to this at times, but Gosling’s Ken really steals the show with his exuberance and comic timing, the two together are electric to watch and make for some genuinely fun moments. Additionally, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cera, and America Ferrera all provide delightful supporting turns, with the latter given some meaty monologues to deliver, though I was disappointed with the scenes involving Will Ferrell, an actor I generally enjoy, but felt his scenes to be the weakest throughout. In the least surprising comment here, the production design of Barbie is stunning, the attention to detail in the sets and practical work is excellent, and setpieces pop off the screen with real vibrance - as do the banging musical segments. Sometimes, musical pieces can disrupt the flow of a film, but not here. Each segment worked to elevate the sequences whilst helping to bridge to the next section of the film, each filled with great songs and smile-inducing choreography - especially the ace “I’m Just Ken”. When I think of a Barbie movie, I can say that this was not what I had in mind, but I’m pleased to have been blindsided. Gerwig’s script speaks of empowerment and independence and is a rallying call to all watching but it also provides strong humour and more than a smattering of self-awareness. The tonal and narrative balance is handled incredibly well throughout, and, whilst Barbie can’t claim to be perfect and certainly won’t appease everyone, I thought it was a blast and my Kenergy levels were satisfied. Life in plastic really is fantastic, clearly. Christopher Nolan is back. That statement alone is enough to whip the internet into a frenzy of lust and desire, which (in a weird way) is understandable given the man's track record - except you Tenet, and The Dark Knight Rises - but the allure of a Nolan film is near-undeniable. Oppenheimer presents possibly his most straightforward narrative outside of his Batman trilogy, that’s not to say it's linear and suddenly conventional, because it isn’t, but this biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer is fairly faithful to what is known of the man - alongside some subjectivity, of course. Oppenheimer, the creator of death and the destroyer of worlds, the man behind the creation of the atomic bomb, but what of the man himself? This is the story Oppenheimer strives to tell - what was his life like? What was the creative process behind the bomb? What were the ramifications on Oppenheimer pre and post-World War II? The film strides headfirst into the mind of Oppenheimer (Murphy) to deliver a superb drama diving into the psyche of the man who provided the world with the weapon needed to destroy itself. Now, the film is three hours long, that’s a long time on anybody’s watch, and, admittedly it took me a while to get into Oppenheimer, the first third covered his life and romances mostly outside of the scope of the Manhattan Project which, whilst interesting, carried little emotional weight. Once he was recruited as Project Director of Manhattan by General Groves (Damon), the film went off. The ticking clock technique created real tension, despite the audience knowing the outcome, and Nolan crafts some terrifically tense scenes during the creation process, and later some truly abhorrent scenes involving politicians and their inhumane indifference to the ramifications of their actions. This story is interweaved with black-and-white footage focusing more on Robert Downey Jr’s Lewis Strauss - a Senior Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) member who holds ill will towards Oppenheimer for perceived slights across the years - in his attempts to gain a coveted seat on the US Senate and tarnish Oppenheimer’s legacy simultaneously through rigged hearings (Nolan has since stated that the scenes in colour represent subjectivity, and the black-and-white scenes represent objectivity). These methodical scenes are powered by intense political maneuverings and fabulous performances from all involved, which can be said for the film overall. Cillian Murphy is simply excellent in the lead role, exuding calm, sheer anxiety, charm, and menace all at once in his portrayal of Oppenheimer, and the same can also be said for Downey Jr. who delivers his finest performance since Zodiac. These two superb performances nestle alongside a list of excellent supporting performances including Blunt, Damon, Hartnett, and Ehrenreich - though the who’s who cast all bring their finest to the table. The problem with such a stacked cast is that means lots of characters that you NEED to memorise. Outside of Oppy and Strauss, many of the characters were lacking in depth and emotion - despite the performances - leaving it hard at times to recall just who was who and what they meant to the story overall. This felt most prominent after the Physicist Avengers had been assembled and there was never a shortage of characters on screen contributing at any point. The film, also, is dialogue heavy, and dialogue has often been used as a stick to beat Nolan with, but there are no issues with the screenplay here, it’s the audio mix that again plagues proceedings. Some of the dialogue is incomprehensible at times which is unforgivable in a film of this stature, especially given the sound FX throughout resonates and booms with such clarity and Ludwig Göransson’s layered score soars majestically amongst the mix. It’s not an aspect that will necessarily kill the experience but it does impact it somewhat. That, alongside the weighty dialogue and long runtime, may turn off the casual audience, but honestly, the runtime wasn’t an issue aside from the opening forty-five minutes or so, the film is paced extremely well and the sharp editing really helps to ensure that the conjured energy remains. Though rewatchability may not be as fervent as some of his previous works, Oppenheimer will stand amongst Nolan’s greatest achievements - a powerful and profound film that looks beyond the bomb and at the man behind it. A man who couldn’t bring himself to watch the outcome of the destruction caused by his creation, a man racked with guilt, and a man tossed aside by a rotting government - but, ultimately one of the most important people to ever walk the Earth. In Yuval Adler’s fourth directorial effort Sympathy for the Devil, we see Nicolas Cage with red hair in a fabulous red blazer. That’s what I am here for. Cage-craving aside, the film sees Cage’s unnamed but dangerous stranger essentially hijack a car driven by David (Kinnaman) - who is en route to be with his wife as she gives birth - for unknown reasons, but reasons that will be revealed as the mystery unfolds. Playing similarly to 2004’s Collateral, Sympathy for the Devil is ostensibly a two-piece between Cage’s madcap passenger (AKA The Passenger) and Kinnaman’s reserved David, the majority of the film takes place in David’s car as they drive to an unspecified destination, and the two engage in menace-tinged discussion with The Passenger entranced in the belief they are connected in some way whilst David frantically looks for ways out of his situation. The tête-à-tête between the two is intriguing, unfortunately, a problem lies in that the reason why The Passenger chose David specifically is built up as the crux of the movie, however, it’s fairly apparent early on just why David was chosen as the dialogue lays it on pretty thick. It’s a shame as when the reveal later occurs, it feels underwhelming especially given the journey to get there does include some fantastic sequences - a scene in a diner is packed full of great and nefarious moments (plus a lot of talk about cheddar cheese…). It’s these moments where Cage explodes into life, sometimes too much as he is prone to doing, but he is effortlessly watchable in these moments as he charms, threatens, shoots, and dances his way through the scene. Kinnaman, on the other hand, is solid in a role that requires much less bombast and more subtlety and whilst the performance overall isn’t as strong, it serves its purpose well in the overall narrative. Visually, the film lends itself to a more grounded look, with Cage’s flamboyant appearance standing out against the film’s otherwise muted look, though it still retains a stylish aesthetic. Overall, Sympathy for the Devil is a satisfying watch that will please both Cage and genre fans, it's a very decent thriller that contains enough to remain gripping without ever threatening to break new ground. Daniel and Michael Philippou, creators of the YouTube channel RackaRacka, are best known for their comedy-drenched horror videos online, so it came as somewhat of a surprise that their debut feature Talk to Me was anything but a laugh-a-minute comedy-horror. Instead, the film dives into how grief and trauma can act as an all-too-tempting calling card for malevolent forces, or in this case, demonic forces. Mia (Wilde) is struggling with the loss of her mother and finds solace in her friends Jade (Jensen), Jade’s brother Riley (Bird), and boyfriend Daniel (Dhanji), so when one night they decide to participate in a seance involving a creepy embalmed hand, Mia unwittingly opens the door to real evil. Now, the premise sounds like one that has been seen time and time again, and, whilst its true that Talk to Me isn’t particularly original, it strips back the premise to its rawest form to focus on characters and some genuinely chilling scares and setpieces - sometimes simpler is better (in the most positive sense). The young cast all turn up to provide good performances, Mia Wilde carries the film confidently on her young and talented shoulders, having to switch between simply being a teen, anxiety, grief, fear, and more whilst Joe Bird is creepy as hell as Riley, who bears the brunt of the evil spirits' rage. Now, to the scares. The Philippou’s know how to craft atmosphere from a scene and use all the tricks in the box - except the god-awful ear-piercing music shrieks - to eke out a nasty tone pretty much from the get-go. The seance scenes carry real menace and images that will linger long after the credits, whereas the ‘possession’ scenes too just feel sinister, there’s less camp and silliness from the demon and more violent head-smashing, skull bashing, and blood licking - the visual horrors and practical effects are delivered excellently to achieve an unnerving tone throughout the breakneck ninety-minute runtime (a runtime that maybe could have been extended by a short period to allow for further exploration or for certain scenes in the latter half to breathe). The tone becomes so unnerving that I began to worry for the safety of the characters as if the events were genuinely unfolding on screen, such was the successfully grounded approach the film adopts and the fact that the filmmakers weren’t afraid to take certain…steps along the way. I do think certain aspects could have been developed further, but crucially the film isn’t interested in becoming bogged down with exposition regarding the infamous embalmed hand or its history, it just wants to scare you - a few nitpicks aside, I enjoyed this a lot. Talk to Me represents another fabulously grimy and effective horror from Down Under - it’s creepy, it’s nasty, and it’s bloody good.",POSITIVE

"Jul 23, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is back with his sixth feature, 25 years after his feature debut Following. He’s reached a point where his films are regarded as motion picture events, as is the case with this one. Nolan has been rather obsessed with this subject matter for a long time, even his previous film Tenet deals with a doomsday bomb and has a reference to the Manhattan Project. While Tenet feels like one big time-twisting puzzle, Oppenheimer is actually more clear-cut despite its shifting timelines.  J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) was dubbed the American Prometheus, hence the quote from Greek mythology at the start of the film that Prometheus stole fire from the gods and was eternally condemned for his actions. Nolan adapted his screenplay from a Pulitzer-prize-winning book by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, which chronicles the triumphs and tragedy of the father of the atomic bomb.  Per Nolan’s tradition, the film doesn’t follow a linear narrative as it jumps around from different periods of the protagonist’s life. The three main acts are interwoven together, deftly edited by Jennifer Lame, weaving scenes from his college years in Europe to the two separate hearings, and of course, the process of creating the atomic bomb itself. This film consists mostly of men in suits writing on chalkboards, talking about science and politics in various nondescript rooms, yet there is constant tension and a sense of impending doom that permeates every scene. That unsettling aura is unrelenting with barely any moment of levity. What seems like a series of mundane activities is anything but, it’s all building up to that fateful day, that is the world’s first nuclear test on July 16, 1945, code-named Trinity. The way the scene plays out gives me goosebumps. After 3 years, 400 people, and $2 billion dollars invested in the project, it all comes down to this and its tremendous weight is palpable on Oppenheimer’s slender face and piercing blue eyes. The moment of detonation itself is utterly dramatic… there’s no music, barely any noise at all, just the sound of Oppenheimer’s heavy breathing. Nolan’s insistence on practical effects instead of CGI lends authenticity as we could practically smell and feel the wind knocked out of the people witnessing the explosion. It literally takes my breath away. Just as indelible to me are the scenes that play out before and after that test. There’s the scene when Oppenheimer told US Army engineer Leslie Groves (scenery-chewing Matt Damon) that the chance of this test igniting the atmosphere and killing every living creature on Earth is near zero. ‘Theory will only take us so far,’ he quips nonchalantly. It’s hard to shake that the scientists went ahead anyway knowing there was a chance, albeit a smidgen, that the world might not survive.  By the time the US dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki though, gone is Oppenheimer’s cool, unruffled demeanor. As he takes the stage at Los Alamos, he’s deeply disturbed by the ramification of his creation. His harrowing hallucinations of the victims of the atomic bomb–charred bodies, skin peeling off–are something out of a horror movie. His biggest fear has actually materialized “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” a line from Hindu scripture that he utters early in the film during his tryst with Jean Tatlock (fearless Florence Pugh). Speaking of the tryst, Nolan isn’t exactly known for overt sexuality in his movies, so it’s pretty unusual to see nudity and sex scenes here. I think the scenes humanize the characters and show the complexity of their relationships. The romance between him and Tatlock feels rather cold however, crafting warmly intimate scenes is clearly not Nolan’s strong suit. On a related note, Nolan’s female characters often get the shorter end of the stick as most of his work is so male-centric.  He does make an effort with feisty Kitty Oppenheimer (the always-excellent Emily Blunt). Her complex character feels far more fleshed out here and she’s instrumental in her husband’s journey. I’m hopeful there’ll be more nuanced and compelling female characters in Nolan’s future work. The massive cast is top-notch, led by Cillian Murphy showcasing his best leading performance yet. He’s often relegated to supporting roles in Nolan’s films but this is his time to shine with his brilliant, mesmerizing performance. Definitely a role he’s born to play and I’m convinced he’ll be the one to beat come next year’s Oscars race. Robert Downey Jr. as Oppenheimer’s ally-turned-foe Lewis Strauss will likely nab awards in the Supporting Role, his best post-MCU role by a long shot. There are simply too many actors to name and the rotation of scientists, military figures, and politicians kind of blur together. Out of those lot, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, and Alden Ehrenreich stand out, as well as cameos by Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. On a technical level, the film is a feast for the senses. It looks great at the standard 70mm theater so I bet it would look even better at IMAX 70mm. The stunning visuals are courtesy of Hoyte Van Hoytema, mixing black/white and color aesthetics seamlessly. The wide shots seem to be an homage to David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia. The sound design is excellent, though at times the background music comes out too loud that it drowns the dialog in a few scenes. And there’s the music… right from the start, Ludwig Göransson’s violin-heavy score is omnipresent–emotive, haunting, and thunderous, which fits the film’s ominous tone perfectly. It’s yet another fruitful collaboration between Nolan and the Swedish composer after Tenet, one of my fave scores of the past decade. Overall I admire this film and what Nolan has accomplished here. I’m not a science buff and largely unfamiliar with the subject matter, yet I was quite immersed in the film from start to finish. The three-hour running time flies by relatively fast, though some of the scenes at the senate hearing could’ve been trimmed quite a bit. While it was difficult to follow at times, in the end, it doesn’t really matter if we don’t get what quantum theory is all about, so long as we grasp the magnitude of what these scientists built and its impact on humanity’s future. I do think Nolan succeeds on that front, giving us a majestic thought-provoking piece of cinema that will fuel many conversations. The moral of the story is still relevant to our world today, how technological advances can often lead to our own demise if not used carefully. I’m in the camp that thinks Nolan is a visionary director and this one further cements his auteur status. He’s an astute and highly intelligent director who continues to challenge himself, as well as his viewers. Oppenheimer sure is a challenging film in every sense of the word, a fiercely unconventional, genre-defying biopic fitting for an unconventional historical figure. I might see this film either next weekend or the weekend after as I do want to see this because of Nolan and the cast (as I hope it’s better than Tenet which I liked but it was a mess).  I just got back from seeing Barbie!!!!!!!! The 3 hours runtime scares me but I’ll probably see it sometime next week. There’s a showing at Dolby Cinema and looks like Southdale has pulled out their 70mm projector for this film. I just won’t drink too much before the show. Lol! Y’know, the 3-hour runtime was daunting but Nolan did a great job in immersing you in the story that it actually flew by relatively fast. I actually didn’t have to go to the bathroom the entire time but yeah, I tried not to drink too much beforehand. I wish there were a 70mm IMAX here in the Cities. I rewatched Tenet a year ago or so and liked it a bit more than the first time but still it’s a super confusing film! If I see it at a Dolby Cinema, the preview will be at about 30 minutes, so I’ll be in theater for 3 and half hours. So, I’m thinking I’m just gonna wait till it comes out on streaming to see it. That way I can hit pause when I need to use the restroom. Lol! If I ever became rich, I’ll purchase the IMAX theater at the zoo and reopen it. Currently, it just sits there and no one with money seems that interest in reopening it. I don’t find anything entertaining about Tenet. It’s just characters telling the audience what’s going on in the movie. Without the whole inversion thing, it’s just a lame action thriller. Definitely Nolan’s first terrible film. Ted, I hope you get to see it on a screen with big sound!
I did, yesterday with some luck, and we found it literally awesome.  I was surprised by how immersive Oppenheimer was, considering I didn’t get much of the discussion about quantum physics, ahah. Cillian Murphy is astounding here! Yes, I agree!! Cillian is such a phenomenal actor, I’m surprised he’s never been nominated for an Oscar yet. He deserves to win this one! Film is in my blood.

"Jul 23, 2023"," So building a cohesive story about him — the physicist who helped define an entire scientific field so new and arcane it was called ""boys' physics""; the precocious child-genius who delivered a scientific lecture at 12; the prideful, self-promoting father of the atomic bomb; the financial supporter of both communists and Jewish victims of the Nazis; the forgetful and rude philanderer whose first media attention came from leaving a woman stranded in a car on a mountain peak as he walked home and went to sleep — is, if nothing else, a feat of economy.  American Prometheus, the biography upon which Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is based, took 25 years and 600 pages to describe it all. If you asked Nolan, he'd probably be proud he cut it down to three hours.  The way he achieves it is a testament to that story, as well as to what the dying world of Hollywood can produce when championed by an auteur. Because as it follows the harried physicist (played by Cillian Murphy) through his early days of self discovery, a successful career in quantum physics, to his management of the Manhattan Project and eventual pillorying by the government, Oppenheimer doesn't concern itself with a classically satisfying character arc. That both elevates Oppenheimer into something more than just another biopic and threatens to make it difficult to access. Because while Oppenheimer will likely be remembered as one of the best popular films of the decade, the careful and incisive character study is worlds apart from the Dunkirk-style, visual war-spectacle it's been billed as. Complicated by its incredible fidelity to historical fact, slightly hurt by an overabundance of stars and triumphant in its performances, Oppenheimer is an extraordinary movie both because of and in spite of its morose complexity.  When it comes to deciding whether Oppenheimer is deserving of attention, though, the first question is practical. Ever since his Dark Knight trilogy, Nolan has long had an affinity for filming in the Imax format, leaving audiences struggling to decide which of the various screenings his movies warrant. Unfortunately, there are only six theatres in Canada capable of screening Oppenheimer in the Imax 70mm format Nolan made the movie for. While the director recommends a 70mm screening if you can't find an Imax 70MM one, and Imax recommends seeing it in any Imax format possible, it hasn't stopped debate between fans over which is best. And as that debate grows, it only serves to fuel the misconception that Oppenheimer is a typical WWII movie held up by fantastic visuals. While there are beautiful, Tree of Life-esque moments showing particles and waves, most of Oppenheimer is told in boardrooms, laboratories and parks. Depending on which format you watch it in, you may feel more immersed — but those who expect to feel the full power of Saving Private Ryan's beach storming scenes, or are just excited for a big Imax boom, will likely feel let down. Instead, Oppenheimer works almost as a diptych — an artwork split into two halves that, while separate, inform one another. Here, it feels like two movies with two messages. The first is the more typical: the tortured genius enlisted into a secretive government project to win the war by Matt Damon's gruff Lt.-Gen. Leslie Groves.  Damon is only the first of a host of familiar faces to pop up in the background. Everyone from Casey Affleck, to Josh Peck, to Josh Hartnett to Florence Pugh show up in the dust-whorled backgrounds to, at times, break the immersion. The beginning of the movie operates more as a clip show than establishing sequence, as we spend nearly 45 minutes following a flatly affected Oppenheimer, dutifully detailing the early events of his life without much character development.  That said, those events are impressively faithful to history: yes, U.S. Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson really did save the Japanese city of Kyoto from bombing because he enjoyed holidaying there, and Oppenheimer really did read all three volumes of Das Kapital in German.  But it's the second half of the movie where Oppenheimer really earns its accolades. After successfully building the bomb, Oppenheimer is plagued by guilt and made to grapple with his past communist leanings through protracted security hearings born of the ""red scare"" McCarthyism era in the U.S. Those concerns, along with guilt over his rampant infidelity, produce some of the most compelling scenes. As in Pablo Larrain's criminally underrated Spencer, Oppenheimer's world breaks around him into metaphorical symbols and hallucinations — revealing the inner psyche of the man as it crumbles in on itself. As he is forced to celebrate his achievement among an ecstatic crowd, Oppenheimer is suddenly stepping into a cracked and burned corpse. As he is forced to describe his affairs in front of a government hearing and his own wife, he is suddenly naked and with her as the committee continues on.  These scenes also bring up, surprisingly, the strongest conflict in a film about a world war: eccentric genius Oppenheimer versus the vindictive, jealous naval officer and then nominee for U.S. Secretary of Commerce Lewis Strauss, played by Robert Downey Jr.  Their conflict of a doomed but brilliant iconoclast taken down by a self-important runner-up to their own peril is nothing new: think Mozart and Salieri, Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr or even Patch Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman's surly Mitch.  Here, though, it's less about the characters than a finding. From the beginning to Nolan's visually stunning and prophetic end, Oppenheimer never seems able to exert control over where he — or humanity as a whole — is headed. He is unable to control the outcome of his relationships, fight back against the sham hearings against him, control the use of his weapons, or stop the later development of the even deadlier hydrogen bombs.  With its fatalistic bent, Oppenheimer is another of the year's pessimistic parables like Beau is Afraid and Asteroid City, seemingly plucked right from a public unconscious staring right at an apocalyptic end. As an obviously bleak counter to the bright, simultaneous release of Barbie, it works as a rumination on America's building up and destruction of its heroes while wielding Oppenheimer himself as a window into America's debate over whether its actions to save the world have ultimately — and inevitably — doomed us all. It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," Note from Marvelous Geeks’ Team: This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the [series/movie/etc] being covered here wouldn’t exist. We stand with and for them. It’s difficult to say what one’s favorite Christopher Nolan’s film is, depending on preference, mood, and perhaps even the time of day, but it’s unquestionable to note that Oppenheimer is indeed his magnum opus. The long-anticipated film meant to be seen and experienced in theaters is an explosive character study on all fronts, strengthened by a stimulating vision and an astounding, unmatched cast. Only Nolan could take a narrative based on history most of us know and somehow keep viewers on the edge of their seats. Oppenheimer features what might just be the most riveting third act in years, guaranteeing that the film likely dominates upcoming award seasons. It’s a brilliantly complex and achingly haunting character study that meticulously brings to life the pathos of war and the unnerving horrors of nuclear obliteration. In true Nolan fashion, it’s a success for its immersive sight and sound, but it also deserves praise on its transitions—for a story that spans years, never does it get perplexing to follow the cuts. It’s a prodigious credit to editor Jennifer Lame. A film like Oppenheimer is tough to swallow at times but impossible to look away from. Despite various historical inaccuracies bound in adaptations, the film nevertheless obliges as a unique recollection of sorts. In large part, it’s due to an irrefutable tour-de-force performance from Cillian Murphy. The narrative tells us plenty, but Murphy capes the words around his entire physicality and evokes something devastatingly tormenting in every frame. There’s a fracture in his demeanor even when he’s smiling and developing. There’s a state of disarray that sparks right after the Trinity detonation that follows the viewer home, too. It’s something Nolan accomplishes acutely as a director, but Murphy throws his hat in the ring with a slow, subtle breach that’s as disruptive as the character’s anxiety-ridden psyche. Oppenheimer doesn’t tell the audience how to feel—this isn’t a historical account that points viewers toward one direction or another; instead, it obtrusively detonates the calamities of an idea becoming an actuality. It highlights the perils of war and man’s actions amidst desperate conditions. Theories aren’t dangerous; the concept of a weapon to cease a seemingly never-ending battle isn’t questionable in hindsight, but what happens when it becomes real? What happens when we recount the casualties and the human lives outside governments and regimes? As the titular character wrestles with his accomplishments, staggering back and forth at times with the complicated emotions that make up guilt and uncertainties, the idea of a changed world becomes a reality in the face of one man. Countless phenomenal actors could’ve done a masterful job in the role, yet it feels tailor-made for Cillian Murphy, whose ocean-blue eyes are entrapments alone. You can’t look away, even when you want to—even when it gets too challenging to glare into the agonizing polarities floating like endless debris inside the character. With this detail, the film also succeeds because of everything Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss brings to the courtrooms and lowly offices. I will often argue that Downey Jr. proved himself with the character study conducted throughout his journey as Iron Man, but it’s high time the world outside of steel and mechanics understand what the man is capable of. He not only deserves the nomination for his performance but the win. He’s ruthless, agonizing, and so intently tuned into the role it’s as alluring to watch him as it is to see Murphy’s embodiment. The same can be said for Alden Ehrenreich, who carries his own with exceptional ease, bringing one of the more surprising performances from a cast the audience already expects much from. Blunt is magnetic as Kitty Oppenheimer, and the tactful frustration and stamina she carries in silence is astonishing. Pair the words she speaks with her expressions alone to the fiery prose that pulses through in the last 20 minutes, and you’ve got something extraordinary to applaud. There’s also much to say about Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock—two women who deserve films focusing intently on their characters alone as J. Robert Oppenheimer gets here. There’s not a single performer in Oppenheimer who feels displaced or outshined. With a massive cast, they each get moments to glint and push the story forward in the meaty exploration that their character fates colliding ensure. From its enamoring production design, Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography, Ludwig Göransson’s psychedelic score, the performances and everything pressured amidst the towering explosions in and out of frames, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a sprawling, profoundly introspective spectacle and without a shadow of a doubt, the best film of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," Tras conocer que Alemania ha reclutado a un grupo de científicos para desarrollar armamento nuclear durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el gobierno estadounidense decide poner en marcha un confidencial programa de investigación titulado Proyecto Manhattan, con el fin de adelantarse a sus enemigos y evitar una terrible catástrofe que pudiera poner en riesgo el futuro del planeta. El año es 1942. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), un reconocido profesor de física cuántica de la Universidad de California en Berkeley, es elegido como el director de los trabajos de exploración en un laboratorio ultra-secreto, situado en las áridas llanuras de Los Alamos, en el estado sureño de Nuevo México. Ahí, el llamado «padre de la bomba atómica» reuniría a las mentes más brillantes del país para encabezar el diseño y la creación de un artefacto militar que acabaría por cambiar por completo el curso de la historia mundial. En su afán por dejar un importante legado que le permitiera ser recordado – y celebrado – por siempre, su arrogancia terminó llevándole por el camino opuesto, convirtiéndose en el personaje responsable de iniciar una crisis de carácter internacional cuyas repercusiones aún son vigentes, casi ocho décadas más tarde.  Basada en la biografía titulada American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, escrita por Kai Bird y Martin Sherwin, Oppenheimer es un exuberante espectáculo cinematográfico como solo Christopher Nolan es capaz de montar. La majestuosa fotografía de Hoyte Van Hoytema, su colaborador de cabecera, en conjunto con las estremecedoras composiciones musicales a cargo de Ludwig Göransson y el extraordinario diseño de sonido, logran crear una atmósfera de total inmersión, transmitiendo efectivamente la tensión y la adrenalina de las primeras pruebas atómicas, conocidas como Trinity. Los fanáticos del realizador de filmes como The Dark Knight, Dunkirk y Tenet encontrarán en esta nueva obra sus característicos Nolanismos: desde la narración fragmentada, hasta los cambios de textura visual, los efectos prácticos, y las temáticas recurrentes que buscan explorar y descubrir los misterios más profundos del universo y de la humanidad. No obstante, eso significa que algunos de sus vicios también se hacen presentes. El más evidente es el tratamiento de los dos personajes femeninos con mayor peso en el relato, interpretados por Emily Blunt y Florence Pugh como la esposa y la amante del protagonista, respectivamente, los cuales existen a la sombra del genio y figura de Oppenheimer, perdidos en el alcohol y los barbitúricos.  En cuanto a los temas que Oppenheimer explora a través de sus tres horas de duración, algunos de ellos resultan pavorosamente oportunos. En especial al observar las consecuencias del uso indebido de la ciencia, una conversación que recientemente ha acaparado las primeras planas de los principales diarios de todo el mundo, en relación al desarrollo y al empleo potencial de la inteligencia artificial en nuestra vida cotidiana. Asimismo, la película muestra cómo la ciencia y la política tienden a ir de la mano, y por ende, el porqué es importante establecer, desde las primeras etapas de diseño, los principios y normas necesarias para controlar y evitar que ésta sea utilizada de formas que puedan poner en riesgo el bienestar de la sociedad. Un terrorífico cuento aleccionador que esperamos ayude a prevenir que la historia vuelva a repetirse.  Desafortunadamente, a pesar de su proeza visual y sonora y de su relevancia temática, en esta ocasión la estructura narrativa y la precisión histórica de sus diálogos hacen que el ritmo de la película resulte tedioso, especialmente durante la primera mitad.  La cinta se vuelve menos demandante y un poco más ágil una vez que las bombas atómicas son reveladas al mundo, y el espíritu del protagonista es confrontado por las atrocidades de su invento. «¡Tengo sangre en las manos!»,  confiesa Oppenheimer al entonces presidente de los Estados Unidos Harry Truman (Gary Oldman en un sorpresivo cameo), quien dio la orden de utilizar las armas en contra de Japón. El último acto del filme, un drama que transcurre principalmente en los tribunales, cierra con ímpetu, aunque sin los giros ni la intriga que suele acompañar a los guiones de Nolan.  Cillian Murphy se pierde por completo en la piel del personaje principal, brindando una de las interpretaciones más impresionantes de su carrera. El resto del elenco hace un trabajo formidable, con Emily Blunt, Matt Damon y Robert Downey Jr. tomando la delantera gracias a sus sólidas actuaciones y apoyando a Murphy de manera excepcional. Si bien Oppenheimer es quizá una de las cintas más accesibles de Christopher Nolan, y una muestra más de su genialidad creativa, como relato de corte biográfico éste carece de elementos suficientes para sorprender. Las imágenes y sonidos masivos están ahí, pero las emociones no llegan a alcanzar el mismo nivel de grandiosidad. Quienes logren seguir la historia a pesar de la densidad de sus primeras horas serán recompensados con un final que cuestiona no solo al protagonista, sino también la debilidad de la naturaleza humana. Sin embargo, lo más sorprendente de Oppenheimer es que, ochenta años más tarde, muchas de las problemáticas mundiales que desgraciadamente enfrentamos hoy en día son el resultado directo de aquellas decisiones realizadas a puerta cerrada donde el ego se impuso a la razón, ambicionando legados que hoy yacen manchados por la sangre de miles de personas.

"Jul 22, 2023"," A forbidden and destructive technology, a tortured protagonist, intertwining timelines: Oppenheimer has many of the hallmarks of a traditional Christopher Nolan yarn. As an expert wrangler of spectacle, big ideas, and expensive pulp, it would only seem natural that the 52 year-old British filmmaker would set his eyes upon the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the pioneering physicist dubbed “the father of the atomic bomb.” Shooting on IMAX cameras and employing his signature, byzantine structurings, Nolan once again applies his touchstones to the pages of history, this time on the flip side of Dunkirk’s theater of war: the nail-biting buildup to the world-stopping Trinity test, its horrific application in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the complicated, genius scientist at the center of it all.  Leafing through Christopher Nolan’s storied filmography - the “just feel it” time shenanigans of Tenet, the apocalyptic grandeur of Interstellar, the trumpeting “braaam” of Inception’s dream-raiding - it seems that his particular lens would be a perfect fit for the genesis of the most devastating weapon ever created. Of course, the fated New Mexico detonation is irresistible to Nolan - it still serves as the blinding centerpiece of the film - but Oppenheimer, in many aspects, is the director’s most mature, textured film: a devastating examination of the vast gulf between science and empathy, centered by a spectacular Cillian Murphy performance. Taking a page from Tenet’s playbook, Oppenheimer employs its own temporal pincer movement for its framework, a triple-pronged approach that is immediately elegant and affecting rather than finicky and calculated. A clever deconstruction of the source material - Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer - into an intricate triptych, Oppenheimer follows the creation of the bomb leading up to the Trinity test itself, the dogged security hearings that would eventually strip the scientist of his government clearance, and the story of Oppenheimer’s chief political rival Lewis Strauss (a venomous, revelatory Robert Downey, Jr.). Peppered with searing visions of particle collisions and arcing hellfire, ingeniously cut by editor Jennifer Lame (Hereditary), the structure of three interwoven timelines is more than just Nolan-esque flourish, it is a conduit of conversation between past and future. When we’re first introduced to Oppenheimer, in college in the 1920s, his eyes are affixed to rippling puddles in the rain, triggering apparitions of excited subatomics. Is it divine inspiration? Or is it a portent of cataclysmic nuclear conflagration? Long-standing Nolan critics love to blast him for his showy frigidity - “emotionally chilly,” if you will - but from Oppenheimer’s opening frames, it revels in its contradictions and internal, moral despair: a massive, awesome scale that seems to only unspool from the tormented psyche of its subject matter. Stripped of heady science fiction and kinetic action, Oppenheimer is no more than three hours of talking heads and geopolitical maneuvering, but Nolan mines his most riveting - and emotionally complicated - story from Cillian Murphy’s singular performance. Subdued yet expressive, Murphy captures nearly every paradox within Oppenheimer: a polymath who was bad at math, a womanizing family man, a hubristic champion of the working class, and inevitably, a destroyer of worlds. Through Murphy’s tremendous evocation of tortured, culpable genius, Oppenheimer drives its exhilarating propulsion through its parallel tensions of the Manhattan Project’s race to end World War II and Oppenheimer’s own postwar stance of anti-proliferation, one that would only abet the government’s McCarthyist witch hunt against him. Oppenheimer spans decades, but it never feels rushed. Eschewing the rise-and-fall of a standard biopic, Nolan instead pings Murphy’s Oppenheimer against the various figures within his life, hurtling towards a 20th Century Rubicon where the world would be irrevocably changed. His dueling romances with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and temperamental lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), his relationship with fellow physicists and Army brass, his leftist politics and noncommittal flirtation with the Communist Party, they all inform one another and Oppenheimer’s own insatiable chasm of ambition, curiosity, and guilt. Nolan squeezes every drop of buildup to the fateful day of the test; we know that the world didn’t end in 1945, but with Ludwig Göransson’s vice grip of a score and the sunken glint of fear in Cillian Murphy’s eyes, Oppenheimer does its best to put apocalyptic trepidation in the audience’s heart. The Trinity detonation might not be the meat of the meal, but Christopher Nolan still knows how to rip a showstopper onto celluloid: a gargantuan setpiece that recreates the Manhattan Project explosion itself - albeit without actual fissile material - Oppenheimer’s nuclear climax will singe your retinas and quake your eardrums, especially if you’re watching in 70mm IMAX. The awful fruit of Los Alamos is purposefully never shown, instead, there’s a singular moment of queasy reflection: Oppenheimer, post-victory, addresses the Manhattan Project scientists as the magnitude of his creation - and the terrifying schism between theory and practice - dawns upon him. The enormity of human loss palpable through bureaucratic remove and political gladhanding, it’s a deliberate omission to never step foot in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Oppenheimer himself is discarded after his “success.” He had fundamentally changed the fabric of history and science, but a mere decade later, the vaunted scientist would be eagerly branded a Communist patsy, served up in a new fight in a new nuclear age. As the closing moments of Oppenheimer rest upon Cillian Murphy’s weathered face, its harrowing thesis is laid bare: We might be able to split the atom, but empathy is still the hardest thing to come by in this world.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," Oppenheimer (2023) Review: July 16, 1945, 5:29 AM. A moment in time that forever altered the fate of the world as we know it, propelling humanity into a frightening era of nuclear arms race that still casts a massive shadow, even today. On that day, the Jornada del Muerto desert in New Mexico became the site for the world’s first atomic bomb test — codenamed The Trinity Test — supervised by an extremely anxious J. Robert Oppenheimer, who would later be known to the world as the Father of the Atomic Bomb. The intricate details of what occurred on that fateful day have been painstakingly and competently laid out in Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin’s American Prometheus, which primarily attempts to paint a more coherent picture of a man who juggled grandiose ambition, conflicted genius, and haunting guilt all at once. To tackle such a subject matter, let alone the sheer breadth and nuance of American Prometheus into a 3-hour, potential summer blockbuster that centers exclusively on Oppenheimer’s inner psyche, is inherently risk-laden. It is incredibly easy to be swept up in the complexity of the events — interlocked and self-propagating, much like a nuclear chain reaction — and lose sight of a compelling narrative core that is both meaningful and never overly didactic. Throughout his career, Christopher Nolan has embraced ambitious concepts and translated them into accessible crowd-pleasers (barring a few early-career undertakings, such as the taut, brilliant Insomnia), and even his seemingly high-concept offerings, like Tenet, manage to intrigue from start to finish. With Oppenheimer, Nolan takes on a relentless, meticulous approach to dissecting the history encircling the tragic, devastating atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki while shifting the focus solely on the titular theoretical physicist, whose legacy is both troubling and complex. Oppenheimer (2023) employs telltale Nolan-isms: there’s a constant, mad dance with the concept of time to weave together a story that shapeshifts into a nuanced biopic, an intimate look into nuclear terror, and a moody courtroom drama all at once, which he ties together with a dramatically tense, anxiety-inducing nuclear testing that occurs around the 2-hour mark. While one would assume that this particular climactic event would serve as the natural highlight of the film, its true merit lies in everything that encircles the event, like an inescapable avalanche of cause and effect with an increasingly gaunt Oppenheimer at the center. The film’s stacked cast, which felt ridiculous at the time it was first announced, play their respective roles to near-perfection, performing key roles in Oppenheimer’s journey from a homesick, tormented young student to the man he eventually becomes, his piercing blue eyes haunted by something only he can perceive and a fractured psyche that oscillates between genius-fueled egotism and an overwhelmingly acute self-awareness of the horrors he helped birth into the world. Although it is quite evident that Nolan’s magnum opus does not seek to redeem Oppenheimer by softening the edge of his legacy, it bears repeating that a nuanced glimpse into his mind is a deliberate exploration of someone who is considered synonymous with an ominous, oft-quoted, mostly-misconstrued passage from the Bhagavad Gita. Oppenheimer is neither a celebration nor an endorsement of war or the gross power-play that goes hand in hand with the boundary-pushing achievements of scientific research in this particular context — if anything, it is a mirror held up to world-altering cruelties that can, and should, never be forgotten. Circling back to performances, Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss holds the film’s temporal jumps together with a slow-burn yet perfectly timed narrative reveal that allows the actor to demonstrate astounding nuance and range in a manner never seen before. Strauss, who appears deceptively impenetrable at first, is revealed to harbor a particular brand of asinine self-importance common among politicians and men with too much power, dissected brilliantly in stark, black-and-white montages that effectively separates his perspective from Oppenheimer’s synesthetic point-of-view, which almost always verges on maddening sensory overload. Nolan also portrays the pitfalls of apolitical stances that often hide behind the garb of balanced centrism, which, on closer scrutiny, is anything but. This is relayed exclusively via Oppenheimer’s relationship with Communist ideologies, which is flighty and inconsistent at best, but evolves into a heavy personal cross he must bear during the deliberately humiliating trials he is forced to undergo. While Oppenheimer’s political beliefs become increasingly anti-war over time, especially pronounced in the aftermath of the bombings and the raging guilt that consumes him, there’s a reason why he subjects himself to these interrogations meant to break him further. He knows he deserves it, as it is a small price to pay for his actions, but his inner workings remain downright impenetrable until the last frame. Oppenheimer (2023) is not all trauma and horror, as the film balances out its heavy subject matter with subtle touches of humor, which flow naturally as a means to provide momentary respite. But the horrors loom large, weighing on everyone and everything it touches, making it a terrifying yet essential film by a director who masterfully encapsulates this deeply thoughtful, chaos-imbued cinematic perfection.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," In a year that is showering us with cinematic treats such as the latest Mission: Impossible movie, a new Martin Scorsese epic, and the second chapter in Denis Villeneuve’s “Dune” (just to name a few), no movie has had me more excited than Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer”. This historical thriller is based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” which in normal hands could have been your prototypical biopic. But this is Christopher Nolan and there’s nothing prototypical about his work. “Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s twelfth feature film and I can honestly say I’ve been a big fan of all eleven movies that preceded it. Even more (and at the risk of coming across as an acolyte), his last SIX movies each ended up being my favorite film of their individual years. I know how suspect that sounds. But simply put, Nolan makes movies that wow me, captivate me, and in their own ways enhance my appreciate for the art form. To no surprise Nolan has done it again with “Oppenheimer”. Sporting an incredible vision and one of the most fascinating casts in recent history, Nolan delivers what is a staggering cinematic achievement. With extraordinary craft, masterful pacing, and a truly exquisite management of tone, Nolan tells the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of most consequential figures in world history. A theoretical physicist credited as the “father of the atomic bomb”, Oppenheimer was a brilliant but flawed man. Nolan captures all of his complexity and contradictions in this dense and layered study that plays on a massive scale. Riveting from start to finish, “Oppenheimer” examines its titular personality by placing us inside the head of a man looking beyond the world he lives in until that very world consumes him. We watch as he is lured in by scientific innovation and the prospect of saving the world. And later we see him crumbling under the enormous weight of what he has created; torn by ethical conundrums that are only matched by the guilt of his own personal moral failings. “Oppenheimer” is anchored by what might be the best screenplay of Nolan’s career and easily the best screenplay of the year so far. The movie is three hours long and dialogue heavy yet there’s never a dull moment. You won’t find a wasted scene or a throwaway line. Nolan is always going somewhere and strategically moving his story and the characters who inhabit it forward. It’s a textbook case of a movie earning every second of its running time. Cillian Murphy has never been better and gives a stunning three-dimensional performance, portraying Oppenheimer at various stages in his life with spellbinding commitment. We first meet him in his early days studying at the University of Cambridge and then later at the University of Göttingen. We watch as he goes home to America determined to bring quantum physics to the States. He begins teaching at Berkeley where he meets nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence (a terrific Josh Hartnett).  Outside of science and academics, Oppenheimer has an on-and-off romance with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh – more on her in a bit), a psychiatrist and member of the Communist Party USA. Their relationship comes back to haunt him in more ways than one. Later he weds biologist Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt) and they have two children together. But we see their marriage has its own share of self-inflicted challenges. And of course Nolan takes us through Oppenheimer’s involvement with the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb in the remote makeshift town of Los Alamos, New Mexico. There, under the direction of General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer assembles a crack team of scientists to build the government a weapon that can end World War II. Oppenheimer hides from the inevitable consequences of such a weapon by dwelling on the alternative. He doesn’t know if America can be trusted with a bomb. But he does know that the Nazis can’t. So he pushes forward, intent on beating Germany to the bomb while slowly coming to realize what it is they’re unleashing. As Nolan’s intricate story unfolds we’re given flash-forwards that shine a light on Oppenheimer’s tense relationship with Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss (a sublime and awards-worthy Robert Downey Jr.). These absorbing sequences follow Strauss as he’s set to be confirmed for United States Secretary of Commerce. But they’re shrewdly interlaced with scenes showing Oppenheimer’s 1954 security hearing where he faced trumped up charges that he was a Soviet agent. Watching these two threads tie together is nothing short of captivating.  Nolan’s lone miscalculation comes with his handling of Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock. She’s certainly a meaningful character, especially in how the filmmaker envisions her impact on Oppenheimer’s life. But Nolan’s needlessly explicit portrayal does little more than ensure an R rating. You can count Jean’s scenes on one hand, but Nolan’s unfortunate emphasis leaves Jean (and Pugh) feeling terribly shortchanged. Aside from that, it’s hard to do anything but praise this monumental cinematic work. The phenomenal performances top to bottom. The incredible visuals from DP Hoyte van Hoytema. Ludwig Göransson’s beguiling score. Nolan’s impeccable precision and control. It’s all seamlessly bound together in a movie of both historical importance and present day urgency. Yes, “Oppenheimer” is a compelling look at a fascinating historical figure. It also holds a mirror to our world, warning of humanity’s propensity to focus so much on the now that we rarely consider the future. That truth is captured most in the film’s sobering gut-punch final scene – a movie moment that will stay etched in my mind for a long time. “Oppenheimer” is in theaters now. Not gonna lie (and for whatever reason) I have really started to build anxiety over seeing this thing. Maybe it’s the knowledge of how good a filmmaker Nolan is. Maybe it’s the place in history the subject occupies, and this whole thing where Nolan recognizes the sheer impossibility of the choices he has to make and the positions he is put into. So in my head I’ve really gotten this impression Oppenheimer is going to be a hard sit, and not because of a 3-hour run time. But the more I’m reading, the more it seems like it’s going to be thrilling and tense and perhaps uncomfortable at times; I don’t know what’s happening to me. It’s a damn movie. I think I’m in the middle of some kind of nervous breakdown and I’m just overreacting to things. Oh man, for me one of the almost magical things about it is how incredibly fluid the storytelling is. It’s exhilarating and also enthralling. I’ll be honest, I’m pretty stunned at how he was able to pull it off.  It’s not a difficult watch although I can certainly see how it would seem daunting. I think once you sit down and the movie begins you’ll be sucked and and captivated. Those anxieties will vanish. It’s that well done. That alleviates some of my concerns for sure. It’s not like I’m about to take in a Michael Haneke film, I know that, or even something by Mel Gibson that wily old dog, but there’s just something about the heft of this story and this presumption I have of the kind of story Nolan tells. I’m seeing it Sunday night with my dad, I think we’re about to be blown away.  You absolutely will be. And let me say this, Nolan plays around with time as he often does. But this isn’t a mindbender by any means. Its easy to keep up with, and the way things do come together in the end is just sublime. Also feeling fairly intimidated by the idea of me writing about my reaction to it lol. This thing is huge! In so many ways. You did a great job wrangling a review together in short time. That will not be the case with me haha!  Oh man, I appreciate that very much. So many times my thoughts sound better as I’m piecing them together than they do as a finished whole. You know I can’t read your review until I’ve seen it, but I do see you give it 5 stars, and I don’t see you giving many movies 5 stars, so that’s sure thing I’ll be seeing it.  On a related but different matter, have you heard the new movie word for the weekend:  Barbenheimer?  lmao.  I tried to tell my son and he had already heard it.  He and a group of his friends are going to see Barbie (he’s a big Ryan Gosling fan and a little leery of seeing his hero Barbesized.) I do hope to see this next weekend or the next one as I am intrigued by the subject as I am a sucker for history when it’s told in the right way.  Plus, I hope it’s a better film than Tenet.  Besides, I just got back from seeing Barbie and… WOW!!!!! It’s certainly better than Tenet.  Any historical drama that can prove to be a profound lesson in consequences, especially regarding the atom bomb, deserves the most thoughtful director and Chris Nolan clearly wouldn’t let the disappointments of Tenet hinder how he could truly honor the story of Oppenheimer. The individual preferences for some movies, even in the wake of the greatest movies, can be most interesting speaking from my own personal favorites over the decades. I saw the film earlier today and… FUCK!!!!  While I had a better experience in Barbie, this is the better film of Barbenheimer as Nolan fucking killed it.  Expect my review coming tomorrow. Yep, probably my favorite of the year so far. I did like Barbie, but I’m quite surprised at how much this has stuck with me.",POSITIVE

"Jul 22, 2023"," Love him or hate him—if you know anything about him, at all—there’s no denying that J. Robert Oppenheimer was (mostly) responsible for changing the face of the world, helping to usher the planet into the Atomic Age. Writer-director Christopher Nolan brings his triumphant and tragic story to the screen with his new film, Oppenheimer. Framed around both the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) for Secretary of Commerce under President Eisenhower and a hearing to appeal the revocation of Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) security clearance, the film tells the scientist’s tale, beginning with his time as a student at Cambridge and a chance meeting with Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) that leads the young man on a cross European trek of educational institutions, learning all he can about theoretical physics, especially the branch called quantum mechanics. Once his studies are complete, he moves back to the United States, making a name for himself as the foremost authority in his field, along with making his name as a radical with a reputation for challenging authority. It’s this combination that piques the interest of Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who asks Oppenheimer to head the Manhattan Project, the project dedicated to creating a new type of weapon designed to defeat the Nazis and show them who is the real power in the world. Oppenheimer is, without hyperbole, Nolan’s masterpiece. It’s a powerful and celebratory examination of a man who many have probably unjustly vilified. After being celebrated as the man who ended the war, the general mindset began to change in the post-war decade as the true, long-term devastation of his work came to light, and a new, deadlier arms race began. Yet, as this film shows, Oppenheimer worked hard to keep the Cold War from happening, and lobbied whenever he could for tight international restrictions on the development of anything nuclear. Of course, the government officials during the Eisenhower/McCarthy Red Scare era wouldn’t hear of any of this, and did what they could to silence the scientist, including focusing their attacks on his past associations with anything remotely connected to Socialism. This film is an epic in every sense of the word. Its scope is grand, and not just because I saw it in IMAX (which I highly recommend if you have the option). Even though it only really covers a few decades in Oppenheimer’s life, they are the key periods to gain a strong understanding of the man. You also have, as the old phrase goes, a cast of thousands. Well, not really that many, but plenty of actors make appearances, regardless of the amount of screen time. The most notables being Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty, Florence Pugh as his former lover Jean Tatlock, Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence, Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and Jason Clarke as Roger Robb. While the film clocks in at three hours, it doesn’t really feel like that. Nolan uses a lot of short takes in every scene, ingeniously manipulating the pacing through the editing. The film also jumps around in Oppenheimer’s timeline, showing what the story needs as relevant reference. The closest comparison I can come up with is the stylistic approach Oliver Stone used in JFK. As the credits rolled, I found myself on the verge of tears. Tears of sorrow for how the world turned out, realizing every fear Oppenheimer had about this new power he’d helped create. Then I looked at the theater and I practically burst into full-on bawling, this time out of sheer joy. Here was an IMAX auditorium, filled with people to near-sell out capacity, all there to witness a film designed to bring the story of this great man, his achievements and his shortcomings to the masses, with the purpose of hopefully changing the world’s view of him. It was all I could do to choke back these feelings until I was completely outside and in my car. Nothing, of course. Though just once when Nolan makes one of these prestige films, I think it would be hilarious if he messed with our minds and did something like showing bloopers the way old Burt Reynolds movies used to do.

"Jul 22, 2023"," As the Russian invasion of Ukraine rages on, there is an ever-growing risk of a nuclear war or Chernobyl-like catastrophe breaking out. Similarly, as artificial intelligence technology (AI) grows more sophisticated, critics warn that it could lead to a nuclear mishap akin to the plot of the ""Terminator"" film series. In fact, the growing threat of nuclear calamity is such that director James Cameron, who made the first two ""Terminator"" movies, has already given his version of an ""I told you so."" Fellow movie director Christopher Nolan has done Cameron one better: He made a film about J. Robert Oppenheimer (in theaters now and titled, simply, ""Oppenheimer""), the brilliant scientist widely regarded as the father of nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer's story is relevant on its own merits simply because of the man's most famous invention, which changed history. His story is all the more important, though, because Oppenheimer spent his remaining years opposing the militarization of the very weapons he invented. In the process, he destroyed himself. Early in the immense three-hour running time of ""Oppenheimer,"" there is a quiet little moment that captures the essence of this epic movie about the invention of nuclear weapons. Theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is discussing physics with psychiatrist and Communist reporter Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), who notes that Marxists and physicists alike seek knowledge of the laws that govern the universe. They pursue economic laws for moral and political ends in the former case, and immutable scientific laws to acquire knowledge in the latter. As Oppenheimer and Tatlock spar and flirt, figurative sparks fly that are no less real than the literal ones we see as Oppenheimer leads a team that develops the world's first atomic bombs. It is a fitting metaphor for the movie as a whole: ""Oppenheimer"" unpacks the delicate balance between science and ideology, between wonderful ideas and their oft-devastating real-world consequences. For such an ambitious endeavor to work, however, scientific and historical accuracy are key. Fortunately for fans of both, ""Oppenheimer"" delivers in telling the truth about the story of the Manhattan Project, at least as much as can be expected of a Hollywood blockbuster. To learn the reality about the man and the science behind ""Oppenheimer,"" Salon spoke with experts on both. The first important detail that the film gets right is that Oppenheimer, for all of his undeniable brilliance as a theoretician, is ultimately best remembered for practical achievements rather than intellectual ones. ""If Oppenheimer hadn't become scientific director of the Manhattan Project, he would possibly be remembered as someone who contributed towards getting the United States more 'on the map' as a place to get a theoretical physics education,"" Alex Wellerstein, science historian at the Stevens Institute of Technology and expert on the history of nuclear weapons, told Salon by email. ""He did not spend enough effort on his other scientific contributions to really develop them into their full forms — others did, and some of them became pretty important, but he never seemed interested in that."" Instead, Oppenheimer's chief legacy is as ""a key leader in the early nuclear age,"" particularly in developing the world's first atomic bombs. Later on, as the movie also accurately depicts, Oppenheimer's lifelong left-wing ideals caught up with him, compelling him to make peace with his conscience over creating a weapon that could destroy mankind. They also caught up with him in a more threatening sense, as Oppenheimer's past ties with Communists puts him in the government's cross-hairs during the Red Scare. ""When his security clearance was stripped from him in the 1950s, he became a very different sort of symbol about the relationship between security and science in the Cold War,"" Wellerstein pointed out, touching on another theme, martyrdom, also broached in the movie. ""His contribution to history is a pretty complex one. It is hard to exactly define his 'scientific' contributions — it is not so much about any particular discoveries or scientific insights he had (again, he was considered quite brilliant, but not focused enough), so much as it is about his role in the changing context of how science was done in this country."" Author and journalist Jennet Conant, who has written seven books about World War II, including ""109 East Palace: Robert Oppenheimer and the Secret City of Los Alamos,"" elaborated on this point. Conant wrote to Salon that Oppenheimer's chief legacy was in ""sounding the alarm about the danger of a nuclear arms race and dedicating himself, at great personal and professional cost, to trying to implement international control of the terrifying destructive power he had helped to unleash."" Echoing a remark by Nolan, who observed that scientists in the 2020s are warning about AI much as they warned about nuclear weapons in the 1950s, Conant added that Oppenheimer ""imposed this great moral obligation on himself to teach the world about the economics of destruction and it was a great lesson to scientists that they must have a voice in the treatment of their inventions."" Yet even though Oppenheimer tried to warn the world that it could not allow nuclear weapons to be used to fight wars, even as a remote possibility, Conant ruefully noted that the threat of nuclear war is ""greater now than at any time since the hair-trigger era that followed the Soviet's first detonation of an atomic bomb in 1949."" ""In addition to the terrible hazard posed by the escalating power, speed and accuracy of the nuclear weaponry of the U.S. and Russia, China is assembling an ever-greater arsenal and of the other six countries with nuclear capability — Britain, France, Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea — not all have judicious and trustworthy leaders,"" Conant explained. ""The proliferation of portable nuclear weapons, so-called 'suitcase bombs' and tactical nuclear weapons with smaller yields that are compact enough to be carried in a backpack, present a new kind of threat in the war in Ukraine, where it is feared Putin might deploy them to force a settlement."" While all of this talk of war is sobering, it would be a mistake to assume that ""Oppenheimer"" is entirely dour. Quite to the contrary, the film reaches moments of ecstatic joy when it is allowed to slough off politics like a snake shedding unwanted dead skin, and instead focus on pure science. There are scenes in ""Oppenheimer"" that could be edited out and used in high school science classes for instruction: Explaining how all of the universe is composed of atoms, how every atom has a nucleus in its center and how atomic weapons release massive amounts of energy by destroying those nuclei. Nuclear weapons can break apart those nuclei or smash them together, using nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, and there is an eerie, hypnotic parallel to life's human-caused drama as Oppenheimer's physics insights flash across the screen in the form of sparks and explosives. Even while celebrating the intrinsic love of knowledge that comes with pure scientific exploration, however, ""Oppenheimer"" includes ugly and necessary reminders of their real-world consequences. Take how a simple scientific theory — the possibility that the chain reaction wrought when humans start smash nuclei against each other never stops, igniting the atmosphere and destroying all life on Earth — winds up becoming a plot point. Indeed, ""plot point"" may be the wrong phrase; that simple scientific concept is practically a full-blooded antagonist, an idea breathing down the characters' necks as ominously as if it was an actual slimy, scaly, malevolent movie monster. Nuclear weapons can break apart those nuclei or smash them together, using nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, and there is an eerie, hypnotic parallel to life's human-caused drama as Oppenheimer's insights flash across the screen in the form of sparks and explosives. That specific threat has since been disproven, but many other hazards related to nuclear's destructive potential remain. Eliana Johns, a Research Associate with the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists (an organization that Oppenheimer was intimately involved with in real life), told Salon by email that ""while it has only recently become a common topic since the end of the Cold War, the threat of nuclear weapons has remained ever since the Trinity test and the subsequent bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945."" Yet unlike the 1940s, today ""the warheads and delivery systems available in modern nuclear arsenals are exponentially more powerful,"" as well as more accurate, destructive and widespread. ""The legitimate threat of nuclear weapons is greater now since the end of the Cold War, but there is also a misconception that nuclear weapons don't cause any harm unless used against an enemy,"" Johns added. ""In reality, communities around the world have been negatively impacted by the building, testing and use of nuclear weapons since their conception."" This includes consequences that ensued as a direct result of the Manhattan Project. A photograph on display at The Bradbury Science Museum shows the first atomic bomb test On July 16, 1945, at 5:29:45am, at Trinity Site in New Mexico, U.S.A. (Getty Images/Bradbury Science Museum/Copied by Joe Raedle)""Navajo uranium miners in Colorado and Congolese miners in the Belgian Congo were relied upon for providing fissile materials for the Trinity test and were exposed to deadly amounts of radiation without warning in the process,"" Johns pointed out. ""Downwinders and victims of nuclear testing in the southwestern United States, Kazakhstan, the Marshall Islands and Algeria were not informed of the nuclear testing in their areas and are still facing the consequences of exposure to radiation generations after the incidents. These are just some examples of the impacted communities who suffered and whose families continue to bear the burden of nuclear testing."" Did Oppenheimer know about all of these things? He definitely knew about some of the impact that his testing would cause (the movie alluded, among other things, to his expressed wish to return the Los Alamos National Laboratory to Native American communities), but it is hard to say for sure whether he understood all of the details of what was happening so he could build his bombs. Some long-term consequences would have obviously been inconceivable for him. Even if he did not know certain things for sure, though, it is difficult to believe that a man as savvy and well-educated as Oppenheimer didn't at least strongly suspect that marginalized communities were suffering in countless ways while he busily went about proving his genius. The man who spent his last years denouncing the hubris of scientists was, without question, a scientist who readily flew too close to the Sun himself. ""He is a very hard person to 'read' historically, and every historian has their own 'Oppenheimer' in a way,"" Wellerstein noted. ""He was not some inadvertent dove who got accidentally caught up in the matter of making and using atomic bombs. He was a very active participant, despite having a very nuanced view of the use of the weapons and their long-term potential. He does not easily fit into the modern categories that people often want to impose on the issue of nuclear weapons."" Perhaps it all goes back to that scene of dialogue between Oppenheimer and Tatlock. There are two sets of laws that govern the universe, the solid scientific ones studied by Oppenheimer and the nebulous moral ones discerned by Tatlock and others like her. In an ideal world, those who pursue scientific truth and those who seek moral truth would always work together in harmony. Unfortunately, just like the atoms used in nuclear weapons, scientific and moral truths in our real world often crash against each other, all too often with explosive results.

"Jul 22, 2023"," Led by a towering (and career-best) performance by Cillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer” stands tall as Christopher Nolan’s most terrifying yet beautiful work. While a couple of wobbles exist in the non-linear narrative structure, the last act seals the deal splendidly. The final line is its most devouring and perturbing.  Christopher Nolan is one of the most sought-out directors of our time. And although I don’t like plenty of his work, Nolan has earned it. He deserves to be at the top of the food chain when it comes to grand IMAX spectacle, whether he’s working on one of his original works (“Inception”) or an IP-drive blockbuster (his “Batman” trilogy). He has the privilege and wiggle room to pursue whichever story he desires. This is a gift for his Box Office magnet filmography. This free-roaming uncontrollability has ended with him delivering both his best (“Dunkirk”) and worst (“Tenet”) features to date. But somehow, even in the latter cases, it demonstrates his creative and visionary ambition. He fuels his mind with the innovation of the craft. It makes us cinema-goers excited about whatever he presents to us at the table.  His latest one, “Oppenheimer,” can be described as an evaluation of a man and his broken and severely bruised persona — the deconstruction of a scientist and his intractable urge for control. Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb (or, as called in the film, “the man who moved the Earth”), is the subject of this character study. This movie not only examines the mechanics behind the atomic bomb’s construction but also the fragmentation of the titular scientist’ state of mind pre (and post) Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan commits to pick apart the very essence of this man slowly drowning in his morality and urge for control by means of a drama epic that might demand a lot from its audience. But it ends up as the British filmmaker’s most existentially frightening yet ravishing work. To put it in other words, this is his most human.  “Oppenheimer” begins with a rampaging fire, the implosion of a bomb — the expression of calamity in element form. Similar to what has been seen in the teaser trailers, an orange-tinted cloud of death bursts onto the screen. A sound effect emerges. It sounds like the wheels of a freight train clanking against the tracks or thousands of people stomping their feet. And with each second that passes, it gets louder and louder. You begin to feel the heat from the fire and smoke; it is almost like a 4D experience. The audience senses these images and all of their might, and your heart is beating rapidly. That may have also been my ever-growing excitement for the movie after such an exhilarating introduction. After a few seconds into the flames of calamity and despair, it sends us to the past. It is a rainy day on the Cambridge campus.  A young Robert J. Oppenheimer (played in all ages by a towering and career-best Cillian Murphy) is woken up early in the morning by his thoughts and theories. Or maybe it was a supernatural message where he saw a vision of his future — shaken up by what he would concoct decades later? Whatever the case, something in his mind keeps him wide awake. These first few seconds may be simple and don’t contain any dialogue. But there’s a dual-meaning image of destruction and creation. It’s like the music and its conductor, a theory put into practice and the scientist behind it, or the anathematized gift and its courier. This develops a titillating feeling. You are on the edge of your seat. We think about the film’s development rather than its outcome, as we all know its ending, the obliteration of the mind, body, and soul.  As we learned early on, Oppenheimer does not want to play with potions at the lab, as stated by Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), who visited the university for a lecture. Robert is a theorist; he conjures up probabilities and reworking rules to create whatever pops into his mind. Nonetheless, that small talk sets him up for a path of literal and metaphorical obliteration. “Oppenheimer” divides itself into two separate segments: “Fission” and “Fusion.” This narrative device helps orientate the audience in the point of view we are seeing. Fission, the scenes in color, relates to Oppenheimer’s perspective and his thrive for nuclear technology. Nolan provides a mirror of his psyche and emotions. Meanwhile, Fusion, the black and white sequences, has a more objective view of Oppenheimer via the eyes of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.).  What’s most interesting about Christopher Nolan’s latest picture is how he managed to paint the portrait of this historical figure, with all of his achievements and faults presented to us without backing away. Nolan’s vision comes from a place of admiration, while at the same time, he fears for his creation decades later. That’s why Nolan engineered “Oppenheimer” to reflect (and the audience to think) about his contradictions and fixation on his ideas and innovations that ultimately led to those disastrous events. It’s a composed mechanism constructed via the classic Hollywood tapestry of dramatic epics. Yet, with a sense of dread and angst induced by a rapidly changing world. Each hour centers around a specific period — even though it time-jumps from time to time because of its non-linear narrative (which is the cause of the film’s central issue, its pacing and structure) — as well as his character trait. We see the evolution and degradation of his soul through each theory he presents and practice he pursues. Because of such, “Oppenheimer” always remains with a high level of trepidation and fear, not only from its titular character but also those around him. You get to see the effects in every dynamic these people have with one another as time passes by and progress keeps getting made. While some worry about the new world being born by flame and fury, others just want their hands on the weapon. The film focuses on making Robert look like a man slowly learning that he’s one of the people to blame for this new world, controlled by those with similar weapons that terminate everything in their sights. The government forces him to help their fight for good versus evil. And an even more grim fate was sealed for those involved. Hence, when Oppenheimer says, “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” you feel an eeriness that gnaws your insides entirely. He realized that the weapon’s use was for unethical means. The tool itself is neutral; the people who use it determine the fate of everyone. This is what makes Oppenheimer Nolan’s most striking and terrifying work to date. Each vision of the bolstering fire, splitting atoms, and total demise via the presence of a white light adds to that existential experience, becoming more nail-biting than his thrillers and more engrossing than his most lavish action set-pieces. After taking all those enfeebling hours, one remains silent after the credits roll, not knowing what to say. You feel like you are going through the same emotions as the main character. Suppose there was a fault in its cinematic texture outside of the pacing and non-linear structure. In that case, these aforementioned emotions are felt mostly through visionary language rather than by the script itself. That doesn’t mean that the screenplay is lacking on an emotional level. But you are moved more by the visuals and facial expressions than the dialogue itself (with some exceptions aside). At least “Oppenheimer” separates itself significantly from Nolan’s filmography. It presents new skills and aptitudes after more than ten films on his back. I would love it if he’d continue to make these types of epic. But I believe he wouldn’t be to do so with another historical figure, at least to this degree. It feels like he was waiting a long time to deliver this film to us. This is noticeable in the construction (and deconstruction) of the cinematic format he loves to use, to the point where theaters that couple play the 70mm IMAX print had to build around it. Ti’s an ever-consuming and revealing loop that never stops.  Nolan has created a picture that worries yet fascinates, intrigues yet keeps us alerted for a possible future. The last scene will leave you on tenterhooks. Murphy’s simple yet towering glance at the camera ravishes the screen entirely. It has an obligation to close the film. You see the face of a man torn apart fully. He’s a person who lives for theories and leaves with more questions than answers. The black screen reflects his soul, now adrift in a sea of distress by his design.  Hector Gonzalez is a Puerto Rican, Tomatometer-Approved film critic and the Co-founder of the PRCA, as well as a member of OFTA and PIFC.

"Jul 22, 2023"," OPPENHEIMER. With Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Florence Pugh. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan. Rated R for some sexuality, nudity and language. 180 min. In theaters. OPPENHEIMER is, quite simply, the sort of film that isn’t supposed to get made any more. Its epic length of three hours, complex characterization and rich dialogue is not targeted to moviegoers who prefer action-packed sequels. Instead, it is something you have to give yourself over to, immersing yourself in its world as people did with such classics as “Lawrence of Arabia” and “The Godfather” films. It’s based on the life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer, providing a career-defining role for Cillian Murphy. Oppy, as he was nicknamed, was a brilliant theoretical physicist who was put in charge of the Manhattan Project during World War II, which culminated in the creation – and subsequent use – of the first atomic bombs. However, writer/director Christopher Nolan is interested in more than that chapter of history. He depicts Oppenheimer in all his contradictions, including the political and emotional paths he took which would lead to complications later in his life. As with some of his other films, Nolan does not feel bound by linear time. He jumps from Oppenheimer’s being appointed to an elite academic perch where one of his colleagues was Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), to his being brought on by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to lead the race to harness nuclear power before Nazi scientists could, to the post-war period when Oppenheimer was targeted by his opponents and stripped of his security clearance. His personal life was, to put it mildly, somewhat messy. He was involved with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and continued to see her even after he married Kitty (Emily Blunt). Both women had their own personal demons, as well as involvement with the Communist Party. Nolan helps the audience find its place by shooting some sequence in black and white, such as a Congressional hearing where Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), being vetted for a cabinet appointment in the Eisenhower administration, is questioned about his connection to Oppenheimer. If the film has an overarching theme, it is asking what responsibility scientists have for their discoveries and creations. After the war, Oppenheimer confesses to President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) that he feels he has blood on his hands for his role in the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Truman dismisses him noting that Oppenheimer merely created the atom bomb, it was Truman who had to decide to use it. Daniel M.

"Jul 22, 2023"," Unquestionably, Mahatma Gandhi was a patriot. He was hugely important to his nation and his policies helped save lives—in turn, changing the course of history and altering the world. (Though inevitably, as a by-product of his words and actions, lives were lost too. Yet, the scales tilt towards the greater good.) But the man was also despised by some of his own, which is why he was assassinated. Largely condemned for decades, the fringe condoning of that act has become mainstream in recent times, as India’s ruling Hindu nationalists have sought to sideline Gandhi. Oppenheimer—the new film by Christopher Nolan—is essentially about that. The duality of being celebrated because of your usefulness and being cast aside when you no longer serve the agenda of the day. Of course, Nolan’s titular subject, J. Robert Oppenheimer—widely credited as the father of the atomic bomb—isn’t a 1:1 to Gandhi. But just like the father of India, he was hugely important to his nation, and ultimately, the world. His greatest work came at the cost of lives, but it likely helped save more. More importantly, it altered the face of war forever. It also altered him, Oppenheimer posits. In the wake of that devastating event, his policies put him in direct opposition to the military and political machinery. He was undoubtedly a patriot, and though he wasn’t killed—I’m sure some would’ve preferred that—his country turned on him, pushed him out of influence, and made an example out of him. In less than a decade, he went from American hero to being labelled a Soviet spy. Nolan—who wrote and directed Oppenheimer—presents this rise-and-fall character study in a characteristic breath-taking pace. And yet, somehow, it’s three hours long. Still, the film never threatens to drag, in part thanks to what is Nolan’s most impressive ability. (No, it’s not the practical reconstruction of the atomic bomb test that occupies a mere minute of that runtime.) He has convinced leading actors for bit-part roles. It’s not that Oppenheimer has one or two—it has half a dozen of them: Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich, and Gary Oldman among them. Malek talks in one scene, Affleck and Oldman appear in one room, and Blunt, despite being billed second, seemingly has less screen time than others lower down the order. To say that Oppenheimer has a packed star cast is a great understatement. Though it has the trappings of a standard biopic—opening surprisingly with a rather conventional start, as it runs through the character’s early years, at times via a montage—it’s also very much a Nolan film. From the beginning, it operates primarily across three timelines: Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) journey to the making of the bomb in the ’30 and ‘40s, his security hearing in 1954, and Lewis Strauss’s (Robert Downey Jr.) Senate confirmation hearing in 1959. The first is framed through the second, with Oppenheimer essentially diving into his entire backstory. And there are diversions along the way that link the timelines and their characters, setting out the motivations, providing context, and drawing parallels to convey the depth and history of the events. Downey Jr. anchors his own (black-and-white) movie for a majority of the first half, as Nolan lays the foundation for what will become Oppenheimer’s centrepiece in the second. Meanwhile, Murphy and Co.—including Damon, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Gustaf Skarsgård, Michael Angarano, Jack Quaid, and a bunch of others, who play a variety of scientists or military personnel—are thrust into a thriller with socio-political undertones, as they attempt to outpace the Nazis in making the weapon of mass destruction while dealing with technical challenges, the sway of Communist ideologies, lack of control over their creation, and the conundrum of lying to their allies. But that’s only half the movie. After the bombs are dropped on Japan, the Strauss hearings which had been their own thing of sorts intersect with the Oppenheimer track. Downey Jr.’s presence, which had felt tangential in some ways—until then, it had served to raise the stature of Oppenheimer, whose importance was still developing in front of us—is suddenly essential to what unfolds for the remainder of the film. Nolan essentially notes that Oppenheimer’s triumph and tragedy are intrinsically linked. When his country needed him, his beliefs and affiliations were ignored. But the moment he developed guilt over his actions—parts of the film play out like a psychological nightmare—and began to oppose any further development of nuclear weapons, his outspokenness was challenged. Despite the sheer runtime, the multiple timelines, and the breadth of characters who interact with him—everyone from Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) to President Truman (Gary Oldman)—the film struggles at times to paint a clear picture of who Oppenheimer was and what he stood for. That is in part due to the character’s “ambiguous and paradoxical” nature, as Nolan admitted in an interview. As a Jewish American, his pursuit of the bomb came from a place of helping his people and not letting Nazi Germany get there first. In the film and reality, Oppenheimer regretted not being able to use it on the Nazis, as Hitler had already been defeated by conventional methods while it was still in development. Still, even though the rationale for making it had seemingly disappeared, Oppenheimer didn’t stop. America’s military leaders justified its requirement by claiming Japan—the only remaining Axis power, against the entire world—would never surrender. Oppenheimer went along with it. It was only later he learned that the enemy was on its last legs already. Not only were they misled, but they also had little idea of what they were grappling with. Oppenheimer repeatedly notes the scientists’ fear of a chain reaction that could ignite the atmosphere—but no one on the team had any idea about the effects of radiation and the problems that’d cause across decades. The man who had set out to outrun the Nazis had his invention co-opted even before World War II ended. No wonder he vehemently opposed doing anything more, fearful of the inevitable arms race. Oppenheimer is, in parts, what you expect from a biopic. The film opens with onscreen text that more or less summarises what Nolan is trying to say. And if that isn’t enough, he inserts on-the-nose dialogue about the title of the book it’s inspired by, the significance of Oppenheimer’s achievements, and his famous reading of the Bhagavad Gita line “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Nolan effectively balances the gravity of it all, couching the film in jabs and situational humour. (Damon is a big part of that.) He doesn’t forget the importance of lightness in a script, especially one that’s as introspective as this one, dealing with problems of this scale and magnitude. Yet crucially, it is also his most political film yet. Much more so than Dunkirk, which was more in-the-moment action. It’s more grown-up than Interstellar, which cared more about wowing its audience than deepening its themes. And it doesn’t have the blockbuster appeal of Inception or The Dark Knight trilogy. Oppenheimer is far from your average Nolan fanboy film. On the surface, it’s about a man who helped alter the shape of the world. But it’s also about our world today (naturally). A world where patriots are discarded, put in jails, and labelled “anti-nationals”. And those who solely work for their own profit brand themselves as saviours while spreading hate and division. Oppenheimer is a character study that purports itself as a thriller for the majority of its runtime, only to gradually usher you into an entirely different movie. One that studies the hidden apparatus. Where ambition, pettiness, and fear of the other fuse into a cocktail of vengeance. One that looks at how humans—no matter their stature or contribution—are torn down.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023",The Trinity Test sequence&#44; which is undeniably impressive to witness on the biggest screen possible&#44; is where I found myself engaging with the hugely inconsistent spectacle filled with questionable dialogue and Michael Bay-adjacent editing&#46; ,POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," Like most people, when you first heard about the atomic bomb during elementary or jr. high school, you probably asked yourself, “What the hell were they thinking?” If so, this film is exactly what you’re looking for. And who better to direct this film than the legendary Christopher Nolan (Tenet, Interstellar). He’s the grandmaster of IMAX cameras, which this film was shot in! If you get the opportunity, please see it in that format for a full optimal experience. Nolan for the most part is a sure fire win critically and at the box office. He’s one of the few directors in Hollywood who can fill up a theater without the title of his film having to do with a superhero/comic book character. Even with him helming The Dark Knight trilogy, he’s still a highly talented man that knows what he’s doing behind the camera and continues to create not just movies at the theater but wild epic events. Whether his latest film Oppenheimer measures up to his previous films in his filmography is a question that’s about to be answered. It wouldn’t be difficult for me or any other critic to go down a list checking off what we loved about this film that’s probably obvious. Yes, the cast was fantastic and had a wide range of acting that most likely will be recognized during awards season. Also yes, the music and score were superb, and it was also a visual masterpiece. Composer Ludwig Göransson yet again was fantastic, and even is better than before with his second collaboration with Nolan. And Nolan does take full advantage of the IMAX ratio providing a drastically detailed image that will leave your jaw on the floor. Yeah, yeah, yeah we’ve heard it all before and you wouldn’t expect any less from a name like Nolan. However, what does need to be highlighted is first how this film may make you feel. This may sound cliché as well, but Oppenheimer challenges you to go beyond what you don’t already know. This is the main plot of the story, but it even goes further than that. Like Interstellar it will push you to the desire to increase your own education. After that film, which was released nine years ago, today I’m still inside of a rabbit hole of space exploration attempting to learn as much as I can. I nearly feel the same amount of passion and interest with Oppenheimer as well. Never have I ever desired to confront the science of isotopes, fusion reactions, and or quantum mechanics before. Yet once again, Nolan and his storytelling encourages me to do so. That says something and is immensely powerful. Not only that, but to answer the question asked earlier above about, “What the hell were they thinking?” this story dives deep into the minds of Oppenheimer and his surrounding peers to figure that out. This man Oppenheimer was rubbing elbows with Albert Einstein for crying aloud as if they were just friends in a male locker room or backyard barbecue. And not just with those two, this film is filled with genius minds working together and against each other across the world to solve a perceived problem that didn’t exist before. What was their reasoning, and motivations? What events took place in their minds that lead them to the decisions they made to create such a destructive device? Was it something they learned in school, or some childhood trauma that they went through? Or was it a combination of both and just the desire to push the boundaries of technology that had never been known before? The film doesn’t just address the science behind the man of Oppenheimer but his personal and political views that molded it all together. Even stepping away from the science of it all you’ll see the level of pride some characters have to maintain their reputation in the general public. The lengths they would go to to win an argument or some petty dispute that the other party wasn’t even aware they were a part of. Too much pride can kill a man and that’s shown front and center here with one character in particular. It’s also sad to see that one man’s wish to use his talents to help humanity can be corrupted for other nefarious reasons that actually harm mankind. Some hearts are warmer than others, but there are those that are cold and bare, and this film has characters ranging at every level. The runtime is right at three hours long, and while this film is spectacular it’s not for everyone like Nolan’s other films. Oppenheimer requires a certain taste that everyone doesn’t possess. It’s dialogue heavy which isn’t a problem for a good amount of audience members, but there will be those that call it boring. I am not one of them. I appreciate and respect the character piece crafted by Nolan here, and wouldn’t have wanted to experience it any other way. The editing is sharp, consistent, and is able to keep your attention with very little effort. The score is upbeat and guides you through the drama softly with periodic moments of boom! However, while it’s still not my favorite Nolan film which is an extremely high bar, it’s a film that will be studied and analyzed on how to think outside the box and get the job done.",POSITIVE
"Jul 22, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a surprisingly nuanced examination of ethics, values, ego, scientific exploration, the price and consequences of speaking truth to power. I wasn’t planning on seeing this film because I feared it would be yet another film written by a white guy glorifying the white male scientists revered for their brilliance but do harm without having to deal with any consequences. I was invited to a press briefing hosted by Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium and Win without War. The panel participants’ wisdom shifted my perspective and I decided to see the film after interviewing Stephen Schwartz, Senior Fellow, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. During the panel I asked why the US chose to bomb Japan instead of Germany and was given an answer that seemed superficial. When I was able to ask Schwartz a followup question on our one on one interview, Schwartz dove into giving me an answer so nuanced and detailed about the documented history around The Manhattan Project and Trinity (nuclear test) that I had to view the film to see if Nolan tells the truth. Believe me he does. Oppenheimer is an unapologetic biopic based on the 2006 Pulitzer prize winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Nolan pulls no punches as he examines the life of this extraordinary figure in history whose body of work and leadership catapulted humanity into the nuclear age. The script is fantastic. The majority of the film is not sugar coated. I absolutely loved Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt, A Quiet Place). This character, as are the majority of the characters in this film, is written with complexity that reflects how people actually are in real life and Blunt kills it in this role. Every time she appears onscreen she draws your eye in surprising ways. I also love depictions of motherhood with complexity and the brutal parts of humanness that thankfully we are getting to see more female characters embody. As J. Robert Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy is simply magnificent. He holds down this film with a quiet elegance and conveys every moment with truth as he disappears into the role. Every single actor in this film disappears into their roles beautifully. I was excited to see so many of my favorite actors put together in an ensemble to tell this compelling story. There’s Tony Goldwyn (Scandal) as Gordon Gray, Matthew Modine (Married to the Mob) as Vannevar Bush, Kenneth Branagh (Henry V) as Niels Bohr James Remar (Dexter) as Henry Stimson and the incredible Jason Clarke (Brotherhood) as a pit bull attorney who dominates the third act of the film Roger Robb. There’s a scene between Kitty Oppenheiner and Roger Robb that was the best interrogation scene I’ve seen this year. The security hearing scenes are my favorite parts of the film. Fantastic writing, skillfully written, cinematography, editing, props, makeup and hair all departments firing on all cylinders. It was like watching a fantastic play. Other standouts, Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) kicks ass as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves. Damon changes his vocal quality and physicality subtly to embody this role and it’s just gorgeous to see him have a blast being this man. I’ve missed seeing Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) and am so happy to see him grace the screen as scientist Ernest Lawrence. The energy between Lawrence and Oppenheimer works beautifully. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man)takes on Lewis Strauss with both hands and tears up the screen playing this man. The main conflict of the film involves Oppenheimer and Strauss who bump up against one another even though they share the same ethnicity. This part of the film was one of the most compelling for me and made me think about the old adage, skinfolk ain’t always kinfolk. I must mention Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) who is only in a few scenes but this man is effortlessly chilling. His performance is truly stunning. Oppenheimer doesn’t feel like a three hour long film. Every part of this biopic allows the audience to immerse themselves into the story and travel back in time. Nolan does a wonderful job making complex aspects of nuclear science accessible and understandable to the audience. I particularly loved the beginning of the film when a young Oppenheimer is in Europe as a student discovering, learning and in essence in love with knowledge. This part of the story was the most romantic and endears this complicated figure to you immediately. I loved being immersed in the process of learning and discovery as a kind of love story. Oppenheimer doesn’t shy away from the antisemitism of the time and how that kind of xenophobia played a role in how decisions were made. This story is frightening not only because of the nuclear bombs being created that have the ability of killing mankind, the film deals with how difficult it is to speak truth to power and have the fortitude to advocate for what is right. We get an in depth view of McCarthyism, blacklisting and how systemic power is used to silence and control Americans. Oppenheimer is not portrayed as a martyr. He’s an antihero. It’s telling that I knew who Werner Heisenberg, who is also in this film, was because of the ultimate Breaking Bad antihero Walter White who used the name Heisenberg for his meth selling alter ego. Juicy complexity y'all!!! The weakest part of the film is Oppenheimer’s relationship with Jean Tatlock played by Florence Pugh (Midsommar). I wanted to embrace this character but she was underwritten and in half of the scenes she appears in she’s topless which seems jarring and out of place in this story. I can’t quite get my mind around what was off about the scenes between Oppenheimer and Jean but there was just something missing. Unfortunately film makes no effort to reflect the Native Americans and Latinx New Mexicans who were brought to the newly constructed town, Los Alamos to work as nannies, cooks housekeepers for the scientists families who were brought to the site to live with the scientists while they worked on the Manhattan project. Nolan also chose not to include any scenes that had more than one of the Black scientists who worked on the Manhattan project. In addition, the film doesn’t address the harm that Trinity test inflicted on the Native and Latinx communities nearby. Why not reflect these parts of history in the film to bring another level of complexity to the story? Nolan was mindful how he showed the impact of a nuclear blast on Japan and those scenes were deeply powerful without being manipulative or using the bodies of Japanese people to illustrate the violent destructive impact of the bomb on the human body. Instead, he uses the bodies of white women and men to reflect the horror of nuclear weapons. Make up, hair, costume, editing, and all the technical departments were just about perfect. Oppenheimer was a fantastic film which is a master class in storytelling. I was left ruminating about what it takes to speak up, reckoning with how difficult it is to live our values and the deep pain when those we think are allies end up being our most dangerous enemies as the presence of total nuclear destruction is always present.

"Jul 22, 2023"," Cast Cillian Murphy and a filmmaker falls in love. Danny Boyle did with 28 Days Later and Sunshine, then Christopher Nolan followed with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Inception and Dunkirk. There's an arresting, haunting, seeps-under-your-skin soulfulness about the Irish actor, never more so than when he was wandering solo through the empty zombie-ravaged streets in his big-screen big break, then hurtling towards the sun in an underrated sci-fi gem, both for Boyle, and now playing ""the father of atomic bomb"" in Nolan's epic biopic Oppenheimer. Flirting with the end of the world, or just one person's end, clearly suits Murphy. Here he is in a mind-blower as the destroyer of worlds — almost, perhaps actually — and so much of this can't-look-away three-hour stunner dwells in his expressive eyes. As J Robert Oppenheimer, those peepers see purpose and possibility. They spot quantum mechanics' promise, and the whole universe lurking within that branch of physics. They ultimately spy the consequences, too, of bringing the Manhattan Project successfully to fruition during World War II. Dr Strangelove's full title could never apply to Oppenheimer, nor to its eponymous figure; neither learn to stop worrying and love the bomb. The theoretical physicist responsible for the creation of nuclear weapons did enjoy building it in Nolan's account, Murphy's telltale eyes gleaming as Oppy watches research become reality — but then darkening as he gleans what that reality means. Directing, writing and adapting the 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, Nolan charts the before and after. He probes the fission and fusion of the situation in intercut parts, the first in colour, the second in black and white. In the former, all paths lead to the history-changing Trinity test on July 16, 1945 in the New Mexico desert. In the latter, a mushroom cloud balloons through Oppenheimer's life as he perceives what the gadget, as it's called in its development stages, has unleashed. Pre-Los Alamos Oppenheimer is all nervy spark, whether he's excited about a Cambridge lecture by Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh, Death on the Nile), meeting other great minds in his field around Europe, taking his learnings home from to start the US' first quantum mechanics class, or cultivating what'll later be disparaged by a security clearance-decreeing Atomic Energy Commission panel as a far leftwing mindset. He's electric when an animated ideological chat with Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, The Wonder) leads to slipping between the sheets for a tumultuous affair. When he meets botanist and biologist Kitty (Emily Blunt, The English) in the smoothest of sexual tension-dripping conversations, his inertia gets her answering ""not very"" when he asks if she's married. Determination mingles in, too, when Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, Air) thunders into his classroom on a recruitment mission for top-secret work in a race to beat the Nazis. And, it lingers as the ball is put in motion, then keeps rolling, to construct the most fateful ball of them all. Post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Oppenheimer is solidified in his certainty that his big bang, then the others that America's military detonated swiftly in Japan once they knew it worked, is on the wrong side of history. He's fragmented, though, by the response to his horror — including the McCarthy-esque committee mercilessly scrutinising him, his colleagues and others closet to him, while deciding whether they'll still give him access. Amid the political fallout for Oppenheimer's advocacy for scaling back afterwards, AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr, Dolittle) is weaved in, also answering dissecting questions. Oppenheimer is a talky film, sound and fury echoing as heatedly in its words as when blazing light fills the screen. Both the discussions-slash-interrogations and the incendiary moment that forever altered all incendiary moments are impeccably, immaculately, thrillingly and viscerally staged. Nolan identifies chain reactions, and creates them. As he slams the movie's two parts together with his Tenet editor Jennifer Lane's exacting splicing — also letting the contrasting segments lensed so meticulously by Oscar-nominated Dunkirk cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema fling closer and bounce apart, and linking everything with Black Panther Oscar-winner Ludwig Göransson's evocative and relentless score — he crafts his most complex and complicated film yet. His subject demands it. Oppenheimer follows, digs into memory and can't sleep with what's happened. It notices what grows in darkness, shifts reality, reaches for the cosmic and hops through time, too, all in its own ways. It plays like a culmination of Nolan's work as a result — it's certainly made like exactly that — as its namesake tries ""not to set the sky on fire"", as Groves tells him, then attempts to kill the terrible threat of burning skies as a power-boosting military tactic. If someone told Nolan not to set the screen alight and aglow with his 12th feature in 25 years, and his second about World War II in six, he didn't listen — be it with his resonant ideas, his execution or his stars. He paints a fiery portrait of America, especially in monochrome. He unpacks the lengths that humanity will go to to gain control and garner recognition, and the grave costs. He fires moments at the screen that just keep expanding in impact, and combining like Dunkirk's onslaught from land, air and sea. An early gripping scene involving Oppenheimer as a student, an apple and cyanide is one. So is the immediate expectation to lead the cheering after the Trinity test, just as the full meaning of what's occurred dawns, in a sequence that uses dissonant sound to immersive and galvanising effect. And, piercing too is the rat-tat-tat of the interrogation dialogue. Murphy is spectacular, and has never been better as Nolan stares so intimately and contemplatively at his revealing face. How joyous it is to see Downey Jr, also never better, actually act again — his astounding, awards-destined performance is meaty, mesmerising, and something that's been sorely missed. Oppenheimer's is an explosive cast, also spanning Blunt at her steeliest; pivotal contributions by Josh Hartnett (Black Mirror), Benny Safdie (Stars at Noon) and David Krumholtz (White House Plumbers) as fellow scientists; and the influential Jason Clarke (Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty), Macon Blair (Reservation Dogs), Dane DeHaan (The Staircase) and Alden Ehrenreich (Cocaine Bear) among the lawyers, military and political aides. Present, too, each in small but significant parts: three consecutive 2017–19 Best Actor Academy Award-winners in Manchester by the Sea's Casey Affleck, Darkest Hour's Gary Oldman and Bohemian Rhapsody's Rami Malek. Nolan deploys them all in a film that bellows, billows and blasts. Watching, and plunging into Oppenheimer's mind, isn't a passive experience. ",POSITIVE

Next, he reviews Barbie, Oppenheimer, Cobweb, Special Ops: Lioness and The Deepest Breath. Finally, he wraps things up with the Home-Cinema Round-Up with a spotlight on The Burning.

It’s well documented history. Granted the science was better in Fat Man and Little Boy, however it’s the so called trial against to get his clearance cancelled that and his personal demons that was the focus.
You just wanted a war flick with explosions most likely, sorry Millennial boy. Grow up. Just walked out of Oppenheimer in 70 mm at Portland Oregon’s historic Hollywood theater. The movie being driven by the fast pace action, constant cross cutting, and no real characters to speak of made very little room for a crowd to react to. This was really evident during the few moments of comic relief with only to have a handful of people in a sold-out crowd make a quick chuckle before being swept away by the next self-important scene. It was after the point that Oppenheimer was dealing with the psychological fallout of dropping the bomb on the Japanese that I realized that I could be doing better things with my life… like drinking beer and eating pizza. So I did, while watching office space! Of course, everyone else is wrong. When people say something is overrated what they really mean is their opinion matters more than everyone elses combined. Chris Nolan isn’t the only one who thinks they’re smarter than they actually are, it seems. Of all the honest reviews on that particular movie (Oppenheimer) yours list of it’s shortcomings ( and of Nolan in general) is the most exhaustive one.

"Jul 21, 2023"," The scale of Oppenheimer is a step back from Christopher Nolan’s previous work, which is an insane thing to say, considering he recreated the 10,000-foot atomic blast for the film. Needless to say, it’s an extraordinary feat of filmmaking. While the film is a story of history and science, it’s also a character study into the life and mind of the titular theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). We see abstract visions of his scientific theories through his eyes, many of which I won’t pretend to understand. His obsessive drive and dedication are challenged by his strict moral values and loyalty to his friends and country, which paves the way for much of the internal distress that Murphy effortlessly emulates.  Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer likely guarantees an Oscar nomination, but the entire cast is exploding (sorry) with talent including standouts like Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, and Benny Safdie. The speed at which I had to keep pace with this film kept my blood pumping, although that might be due to Ludwig Göransson’s accompanying score. So much information is stuffed into its three-hour runtime, yet it remains coherent, engaging, and unbelievably dreadful.  While there is some time jumping between storylines, most of the film is set in the New Mexico desert where Oppenheimer and his team of brilliant scientists spent months developing the first atomic bomb. For a while, you forget that they’re building a weapon of mass destruction because everything feels like an exciting scientific victory—but in reality, I guess it’s both.  Oppenheimer explores the rigid dichotomy between scientific advancements and humanity’s preservation—and whether they assist or contradict each other. The triumph of the atomic bomb’s success was a celebration for America, but at what cost? Nolan doesn’t attempt to answer this question, but I was left with a heavy hole in my chest that I couldn’t quite shake (which was a weird way to go into my subsequent viewing of Barbie).  For a movie about the atomic bomb, the quiet stillness of Nolan’s Oppenheimer is the most haunting. It’s not about the bomb, but what it meant for humanity. It’s about how our greatest invention meant to “end all wars” led to the Cold War, and whether it was the greatest invention or the destroyer of worlds is what tormented Oppenheimer for the rest of his life.  The atomic explosion is a horrifying beauty, a sight that terrifies the mind but mystifies the eye. I cannot begin to imagine what it was like to witness the event in Los Alamos in 1945, but Nolan’s interpretation is probably the closest we’ll ever get. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn’t exist. “How could this man who saw so much be so blind?” Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) ponders in Christopher Nolan’s newest film Oppenheimer. While Oppenheimer was the scientist behind the bomb, Strauss was a businessman involved in early nuclear power and the chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission. The three-hour epic is a study not only of how the titular genius J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) created the atomic bomb but also of the fallout of its creation within his own life.  Oppenheimer is Nolan’s most character-driven work and also his most simple to understand despite the complicated science and sometimes confusing non-chronological framing. It takes us through Oppenheimer’s early career as a professor and his time leading the creation of the bomb at Los Alamos. In parallel storylines, we also see Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing a decade later, in which his Communist associations are used to edge him out of the nuclear energy conversation, and Strauss’s Cabinet position confirmation hearing, which became a public battlefield for both Strauss and Oppenheimer’s reputations.  If that seems like a lot for one movie to handle, that’s because it is. It’s sometimes difficult to put the full story together from the order in which it’s being told, particularly if you’re not already familiar with Oppenheimer’s story. For those who don’t know, Oppenheimer is best known as the scientist who was head of the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic bomb at the Los Alamos laboratories in New Mexico during World War II. While the bomb was eventually dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the film is a good reminder that it was originally developed out of fear that the Nazis would develop one first.  However, the atomic bomb was no ordinary invention. It took a team of brilliant scientists, but not everyone in the scientific community agreed with unleashing such power into the hands of governments. As Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) says in the movie, “This isn’t a new weapon; it’s a new world.” Bohr would know, as he was the Danish physicist who won the Nobel Prize for breakthroughs in understanding atomic structure and quantum theory. Nolan does a commendable job of reckoning with what creating such a destructive weapon meant without ever showing its victims, but rather focusing on the psychological effects upon its creators and the way that it opened up a plethora of new issues around the government’s collaboration with scientists.  The film also shows how the Red Scare ruined the careers of scientists (along with actors, politicians, and people in just about every profession), many of whom had been linked to the American Communist Party in the years leading up to World War II. Oppenheimer himself had many ties – family, friends, and colleagues – to the party and refused to keep his politics entirely outside of academia while he was a university professor. During the war and through the 1950s, the government used it against him, boxing him out of some things while also dangling their knowledge of his association with Communism over his head as a threat.  With a mammoth cast like Oppenheimer’s, in which many actors only have a few minutes of screen time, it’s inevitable that most of the cast does not have the opportunity to give a great performance. But there are many standouts in the cast, from Matt Damon as the antagonistic but ultimately supportive General Groves to Benny Safdie as the intelligent but disagreeable Edward Teller. Alden Ehrenreich plays a Senate aide working for Strauss during his hearing and gets several little moments of humor that provide levity. His character is also one of the few morally uncomplicated figures in the film, giving the audience someone with whom they can fully align themselves as he also finds out the truth about Strauss’s relationship with Oppenheimer over the course of the film.  But there are two truly Oscar-nomination-worthy performances in the film. Robert Downey Jr. finally has the role that many of us have been waiting years to see him to play, a seeming return to his earlier work as a serious actor before he became a king of the Marvel franchise. It’s a vibrant reminder of his abilities as an actor as he expertly keeps the audience guessing what his character’s true motivations are.  Meanwhile, Murphy’s turn as Oppenheimer holds the film together. Any character study is only as good as the actor playing its subject, and Murphy was more than up for the task, showing Oppenheimer’s anxiety and stress in his physicality through the way he holds his shoulders to the haunted look in his unsettlingly blue eyes.  Unfortunately, though Oppenheimer represents a step up for Nolan from some of the issues that had previously plagued his films, he still cannot write a well-rounded female character. We see three main women that knew Oppenheimer: his friend Ruth Tolman (Louise Lombard), his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), and his lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). All women make the most of their short screen time, particularly Blunt and Pugh, but none are allowed the chance to be a fully-rounded character as much as the male characters are.  Blunt’s Kitty fares somewhat better, despite being reduced to her complete disinterest in being a mother and her drinking problems. Her character arc doesn’t naturally lead to the strong scene that she has in the later part of the movie, but it’s still an excellent chance for Blunt to show off her acting abilities.  If Kitty Oppenheimer isn’t presented in her full complexity, then Jean Tatlock fares even worse. Tatlock was arguably almost as interesting as Oppenheimer himself, having struggled with her sexuality from her teen years onward and earning a medical degree after plans of becoming an actress failed. While the initial sex scene between Oppenheimer and Jean is handled well, demonstrating how their relationship is rooted in an intellectual connection, Pugh is nude for seemingly half of the rest of her screen time in the film, as well. Much of it feels completely unnecessary, particularly when paired with how little development the character is given.  The film also has a handful of other issues that keep it from being a true masterpiece in my eyes. It gets too intense too quickly, not leaving much room for it to build over its three-hour runtime. From the in-your-face cinematography to the demanding score by Ludwig Göransson, it feels like it reaches what should be the climax for your senses within the first hour. This makes the viewing a somewhat exhausting experience despite the truly phenomenal craftwork and acting being showcased.  And the design is truly splendid, from the 1940s and 1950s costuming to the production design, recreating everything from the town of Los Alamos to the Oval Office of the White House. The sound and lighting work in Oppenheimer’s celebratory speech after the use of the atomic bomb is easily the best of the year; it perfectly demonstrates his inner turmoil as he already begins to question the morality of the weapon he has created.  Oppenheimer’s story is a complicated one, and I’m still not entirely certain that Nolan was the best person to tell it. Though still fettered by some of his usual issues, he creates what is almost certainly his best work in Oppenheimer. It’s a complex exploration of the creation of the worst weapon that has ever existed and the scientist who made it, making the audience ponder questions of science, politics, war, and love.

"Jul 21, 2023"," Dos razones se sumaron para alimentar mis expectativas alrededor de Oppenheimer (2023): la curiosidad por descubrir el acercamiento moral al personaje que da título a la cinta, al “padre de la bomba atómica”; por otra parte, se trata del más reciente largometraje de Christopher Nolan, y sus entregas se convierten, invariablemente, en fascinantes e irresistibles dispositivos audiovisuales, narrativos y temáticos. Con relación al primer asunto la película, me parece, se queda corta (porque, en principio y en esencia, tiene otro objetivo); en el segundo no hay queja alguna; salí de la función profundamente emocionado: Nolan tiene el feliz hábito de superar a Nolan.  Oppenheimer, cuyo guión fue escrito por Nolan –inspirado en el libro Prometeo americano: El triunfo y la tragedia de J. Robert Oppenheimer de Kai Bird y Martin J. Sherwin–, inicia la acción en 1942 y da cuenta de la ruta que siguió Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) para encabezar el proyecto Manhattan. A pesar de su pasado “comunista”, fue el responsable de reunir numerosos esfuerzos, que se concentraron en un poblado creado exprofeso, en El Álamo, Texas, y que dieron por resultado la bomba atómica. Fue considerado un héroe, pero posteriormente, en los primeros años de la guerra fría, fue una especie de perseguido político: el gobierno norteamericano desconfió de él en buena medida como consecuencia de las maniobras del vengativo Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), responsable de la Comisión de Energía Atómica, quien se encargó de desacreditarlo.  Oppenheimer es en la superficie una película biográfica, en la medida en que acompaña durante una buena parte de su vida al personaje epónimo y da cuenta de las vicisitudes que atraviesa a lo largo de los años. El acercamiento a su vida se hace desde dos “frentes”: el primero, titulado “Fisión”, se hace desde una perspectiva subjetiva y es registrado en color; arranca con los tormentos de su mente y las contrariedades que vivió como estudiante en Europa. El segundo, “Fusión”, es en blanco y negro y se ubica en los años posteriores a la segunda guerra mundial; en éste el protagonismo lo lleva Strauss, un adversario decisivo en la carrera de Oppenheimer.  En la ruta, Nolan presenta pasajes de una lucidez plausible. Desde el diván del buen Segismundo nos recuerda el nexo entre sexo y muerte: en una escena memorable, somos testigos de la lectura postcoital que Oppenheimer hace de un libro en sánscrito en el que descubre que se habrá de convertir en un agente de la muerte. En otra escena, en la que el fervor desaforado de sus paisanos lo celebra como a un rockstar, descubre –desde la palestra de Sartre, quien asevera que cada hombre es responsable de sí mismo y de la especie humana– que la quemazón de japoneses lo salpica: al matar al enemigo también mata a “los suyos”.  No faltan las intuiciones sugerentes que pasan por la fascinación por los asuntos de los que se ocupa de la física cuántica. Así, somos testigos de imágenes de corte poético, como aquella que sugiere que en una gota de agua caben los secretos del universo; otra en la que la liberación de energía sacude al espectador (porque las ondas sonoras que se emiten “desde la pantalla” hacen vibrar las butacas). Tampoco faltan los homenajes a las mentes brillantes, como los genios de la física Albert Einstein y Niels Bohr; o el reconocimiento a científicos reputados, como los premios Nobel Enrico Fermi y Ernest Lawrence, y la aparición casi fugaz del matemático Kurt Gödel.  Como reconoce Nolan, su objetivo es iluminar la complejidad de Oppenheimer. No obstante, al final no sólo ofrece los ingredientes para dar cuenta de ella, sino que lleva cabo un enjuiciamiento. De forma decepcionante, me parece. Digo, tanta complicación y salto temporal para terminar en el manido recurso del juicio, de dos juicios, para ser exactos (el ubicarlos fuera de una corte, no cambia el hecho de que se trata de dos juicios): uno a Oppenheimer y otro a Strauss. En ambos casos se busca iluminar la confiabilidad de los “acusados”. Ahí surgen razones y sinrazones, explicaciones y justificaciones. (Y en algún momento, en una escena genial presenta a Oppenheimer literalmente en cueros: tanta física cuántica para descubrir que el científico se explica por sus pulsiones.) Pero sobre todo se hace presente la infinita hipocresía de Estados Unidos: Nolan emprende una crítica a las veleidades convenencieras que caracterizan a los norteamericanos, al uso y deshecho de sus héroes, al oportunismo y la ligereza con la que justifican sus atrocidades para incrementar y mantener el poder. Paisaje que no ha desaparecido a lo largo de los años y que sigue siendo vigente. Y así como sucede en el más reciente rollo de Misión: imposible – Sentencia mortal parte 1 (2023), es evidente su nostalgia por el villano favorito: Estados Unidos necesita de Rusia para endosar culpas y pretextos: no soy yo, eres tú.  Al final las vísceras del “Prometeo americano” seguirán siendo devoradas por el águila (símbolo de Estados Unidos), pero, creo, por las razones incorrectas. Nolan da cuenta de la complejidad de Oppenheimer, pero en lo que a mí respecta resulta irrelevante si fue o no comunista, si era o no confiable para el gobierno norteamericano, si el oportunismo hizo de él un héroe. No dio un regalo valioso a la humanidad, como sí lo hizo el Prometeo griego, quien nos dio el fuego. Pasó a la historia por la paternidad de la bomba atómica. Y no estoy seguro de que la historia lo absolverá. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," About a minute into Oppenheimer, it becomes obvious why Christopher Nolan wanted to tackle the project. His subject, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” was a theoretical physicist, a man who obsessed over the building blocks of the universe. He flings crystal goblets into corners to observe how they shatter and flirts by telling women the scientific reasons his own matter won’t just pass through theirs. He dreams of particles and stars and fire; he becomes transfixed by water smacking the surface of puddles. Nolan, too, seems engaged in a long-running investigation of theoretical physics. He intuits some link between the cold material fabric of the universe — things like time, space, matter, death, eternity — and the more metaphysical meanings of human existence: love, identity, memory, and grief. Often, he weaves together emotion and science, then pulls some threads from ancient myth through the fabric to remind us these are eternal questions. From Memento to Inception, Interstellar to Dunkirk, The Prestige to Tenet, Nolan’s movies use the science-y tools of cinema (images, sound, time, chemicals on celluloid) to confront the tangible with the intangible. The man’s brain is a marvel. In Oppenheimer, he focuses his lens on power — the kind that split atoms produce, the kind that countries wield, the kind that men crave. Though based on American Prometheus, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s exhaustive, enthralling biography of Oppenheimer, Nolan’s Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic, at least not the thudding Hollywood variety. Instead it’s a movie — a masterful one, among his best — investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.  Nolan loves to mess with timelines (this is a man who started his career telling a story backward), and in Oppenheimer there are a few. Along one timeline — in color, with opening text reading “Fission” — runs the story of Oppenheimer (an incredible Cillian Murphy), spanning his youthful forays into theoretical physics at European universities, through his years at Berkeley, his dabblings in left-wing politics, his affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and eventual marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his appointment by Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to run the ultra-secretive Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Through timeline jumps, we start to fill out a picture of what would happen to him after — in particular, an older Oppenheimer being investigated by a government commission regarding his ties to communists.  There’s a gorgeous poetry to the way Nolan uses IMAX, particularly when evoking Oppenheimer’s interior landscape. Like Dunkirk (and Tenet, if you were lucky enough to see it in a theater), Oppenheimer will likely be fully satisfying if you can’t see it in IMAX. But if you can, it’s worth it. Nolan shot on IMAX film cameras, and tends to use that footage in the early parts of the movie whenever he wants to give the sense of the expansiveness Oppenheimer himself is feeling as he encounters new cities, new landscapes, new thoughts, and new insights.  Meanwhile, in a second track, we’re witnessing — for reasons that don’t become obvious for a while — an agitated Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who is trying to get approved by the Senate as commerce secretary and isn’t quite sure why he’s meeting with resistance. This section is in black and white, and labeled “Fusion.” Those labels are worth keeping in mind, because when at Los Alamos the Hungarian physicist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) describes his idea for a hydrogen bomb — and someone later describes it as not a weapon of mass destruction, but a weapon of mass genocide — we suddenly learn the difference between fission and fusion. Fission, which splits the nucleus of an atom into two lighter nuclei, unleashes enormous power, capable of leveling Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But fusion, which combines two light nuclei into one, unleashes far more energy and can level, in a sense, the world.  In that sense, you can start to read Oppenheimer as Nolan’s idea of the embodiment of power-as-fission. Oppenheimer is a man who delights in paradoxes; at his first encounter with a bewildered Berkeley pupil, he demands to know how light can be both a wave and a particle, and then proceeds, with gusto, to explain. Yet he lives a life of internal division, at war with his own ideals, believing both that the Americans ought to develop a monstrous weapon of death in order to save lives, and that those weapons probably ought not to be used. The internal distress is so acute at times that the world around him begins to vibrate, his incredible mind splitting itself. Later in life, Oppenheimer’s fortunes would rise and fall; he’d be accused of being a communist, be reviled, then respected and rewarded. Without at all valorizing him — this is not a guy you want to be — Oppenheimer suggests that part of its subject’s power came from his refusal to just collapse in on himself from contradiction. The movie hasn’t entirely figured him out, and history hasn’t either, but there’s no doubt he’s a figure of towering importance. And then there is Strauss, a man who sees power as a grubbing game, a process of gathering everything into oneself. Strauss would support the development of the H-bomb, brushing off the casualties. He’s obsessed with what others are saying about him, obsessed with ego. He would engineer a world in which power could accrue toward his country and thus, presumably, toward him. Such power might be even more destructive, but it also minimizes him.  Do not forget, Oppenheimer repeatedly reminds us: Both of these sorts of power have a small chance of igniting the atmosphere and destroying the entire world.  This is where the movie gets uncomfortable. A movie like Oppenheimer is never just a retelling of someone’s life, especially not someone whose story is, admittedly, fairly well documented. Great storytellers know how to harness the elements of their craft to find the story inside the story, and this one is about the fearsomeness of power across time and space, the apocalyptic nature of it, tied to the expansion or depletion of the soul.  You can see this in the repetition of the line from the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” which Oppenheimer reportedly quoted after the test bomb, nicknamed Trinity, successfully detonated in the desert and showed the scientists and politicians what it was capable of. The line, at least for Oppenheimer, is an acknowledgment that with this terrible thing comes the ability to literally destroy humankind. Something has been unleashed that cannot be shoved back into the bottle. Whether or not it ought to have been is irrelevant; this is a point of no return for humanity.  Curiously, this quotation should be balanced out with one from the 16th-century metaphysical poet John Donne, whose (pretty scandalous) poem “Batter my heart, three-person’d God,” which Oppenheimer would have learned from Tatlock, a Donne aficionado, reportedly inspired him to name the bomb test “Trinity.” (“Three-person’d God” is a reference to the Christian doctrine of the Trinity; you can hear Oppenheimer whisper the line under his breath in the movie.) The full poem is a plea from the poet for God to “bend / [His] force to break, blow, burn, and make me anew”; near the end, in fairly explicit terms, the poet asks God to take him captive in order to set him free, to “ravish” him in order to make him “chaste.” Oppenheimer’s attraction to Donne’s poem is a bit opaque until you realize it’s a litany of contradiction — of, you might say, internal fission. The poem implies real power comes from dwelling in paradox. This is why, in the end, the bomb is not the climax, or the point, of Oppenheimer. The bomb wasn’t even the point of the bomb. For the country that built and wielded it, the point of the bomb was power: the ability to hang on to it, to unleash it, to show that might makes right. The scientists who built the bomb — and their colleagues in other countries, pursuing the same goal — were given power as long as they fell in line with the powerful. When they started to question it all, they were swept aside.  All this raises questions about patriotism and politicking, but in the end, Oppenheimer suggests these petty, bickering matters of individual civilizations pale in importance beside the greatest, epochal questions. If we humans are capable of creating a gadget that can end us all, do we deserve to keep on existing? What does love, loyalty, friendship, or betrayal amount to in the face of total destruction? If you make the bomb, can you keep the end of the world at bay? When you drop the pebble in the waters, can you stop the ripples?

"Jul 21, 2023"," That is certainly the case with his latest – “Oppenheimer” – a compelling story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the father of the atomic bomb. It’s a fascinating character study with a stellar cast anchored by a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy. From the moment Murphy is on screen he commands the viewer’s attention. This frail yet imposing figure who always seems to be working out scientific theories in his head. Nolan frames Oppenheimer’s story from two fronts. We get the story from the man himself during a 1954 security hearing that questions his loyalties to the United States and a simultaneous story involving a 1958 senate confirmation hearing for a potential cabinet position for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) – a man who was part of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and had a long history with Oppenheimer. As both stories unfold we learn of Oppenheimer’s rise to become the head of the Manhattan Project, his complicated social life (with Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh playing two of the women he had relationships with) and his political leanings, which drove his thirst for science but also created many enemies on the political front. Nolan draws his material from the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman which sheds some light on Oppenheimer’s life and his work. Nolan shines that spotlight even brighter with a meticulously crafted film that is as well-crafted as any you will see this year. Nolan’s use of sound is impeccable – especially in the testing of the nuclear bomb – which the decision to shoot the Strauss part of the film in black and white is a simple, yet effective decision that really gives the film a unique feel and look. Ludwig Göransson’s score pulsates throughout and is still embedded in my mind, while the use of IMAX cameras makes this a must see in theaters (on the largest screen, preferably in a premium format). Downey, Jr., Blunt and Pugh are just the tip of the iceberg in a stunningly talented supporting cast full of familiar faces. Among the standouts are Matt Damon as the lieutenant general who put Oppenheimer in charge of the project, Josh Hartnett as one of Oppenheimer’s colleagues and Jason Clarke as the man in charge of the security hearings. The cast goes even beyond that with some surprising cameos and familiar character actors and actresses that only add to this stunning project. The three hour run time does create some pacing issues, particularly in the final act when the focus shifts slightly. It’s a minor misstep in a film that for the most part keeps the audience’s attention in large part to Murphy. He embodies this man in ways that go beyond a simple performance. This is stunning work from Murphy who captures Oppenheimer’s flaws, his mannerisms and his determination in exceptional fashion. It’s a memorable performance in a film that audiences won’t soon forget.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023","Because Nolan’s politics are always obscure, it’s good that his filmmaking is so slick, yet laborious, convoluted, and enervating. Otherwise, a perverse amoral epic like Oppenheimer might be dangerous.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," If Christopher Nolan’s staggering Oppenheimer has a unifying theme (it has many), it’s that the human tendency toward destruction—of self and of others—is unstoppable. The questions then follow: what is our responsibility in stopping human destruction on a grand scale? Is it acceptable to respond with additional catastrophic annihilation? And, if you’re responsible for facilitating destruction on a scale the world has never before seen, how do you live with yourself? Nolan’s film considers these questions, while also exploring the ways great ideas and the people who have them become co-opted and weaponized (literally, in this case) by the imaginationless and power-hungry. It’s a movie about the creation of the atomic bomb, yes. It’s also about the danger of putting incendiary ideas into practice. You can even read it as a parable about craft versus commerce.  Oppenheimer is all these things and more, while also being a riveting portrait of a man whose work we’re still living with the consequences of today. Oppenheimer follows two perspectives. One is J. Robert Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy), dragged into a hearing years after the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan under accusations of leaking the information that allowed Russia to build its own atomic weapon. The other is Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), Oppenheimer’s petty former boss at the Atomic Energy Commission, who’s in a senate confirmation hearing for a cabinet position, and is faced with a number of questions about Oppenheimer’s sympathies and his work at the AEC.  Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema show scenes from Oppenheimer’s point of view in color, while Strauss’ are in black and white. Oppenheimer’s story recounts the events of his career leading up to and during the Manhattan Project, during which he worked for General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) leading a team of scientists at Los Alamos to build the atomic bomb. Strauss’ perspective is post-World War II, following his frustrations with Oppenheimer for shooting down approval on the even more powerful hydrogen bomb. The switch between styles more than clarifies who’s telling us what. It also distinguishes how each man operates. Strauss, an image-conscious political ladder-climber who chases clout and dominance without considering the consequences, has a limited, selfish understanding of the way the world works.  Oppenheimer, who understands ideas in potential and practical forms, sees “beyond the world we live in,” as one character puts it. He sees in color, but the way Nolan depicts him, he might as well perceive things with the rainbow-colored clarity of a mantis shrimp. In addition to Murphy’s fascinating performance as Oppenheimer, the film features a stacked cast. Josh Hartnett continues his renaissance with a career-best turn as physicist Ernest Lawrence. Dane DeHaan is effectively weaselly as Groves’ assistant Kenneth Nichols, who gets increasingly slimy the more power he gets (Nolan recognizes as few others have that DeHaan is best employed in Brad Dourif-style roles). We also get heady, delightful work from solid performers including Jack Quaid, Macon Blair, Jason Clarke, David Krumholtz and local hero David Dastmalchian. Blink and you’ll miss James Urbaniak.  All of this is secondary to the philosophical pondering swirling at the heart of Oppenheimer. Murphy’s Oppenheimer is always aware of what the weapon his team is developing can do. His hope is that it’s theoretical, a warning to the Germans of their capabilities. When it’s finally used in Japan at the end of the war, he’s wracked with guilt while still keeping up a patriotic front lest anyone question his sympathies.  Strauss sees Oppenheimer’s disapproval of the h-bomb and advocacy for international arms control as a cover for communist sympathies. From the other side of the (technically ongoing) Cold War, we know the scientist is trying to halt an arms race. Strauss, who creates nothing, but sees opportunities for might and personal advancement, wants to push those opportunities as far as possible with little thought to how others will suffer. Oppenheimer, the actual creator, understands the consequences of what Strauss wants, but lacks the clout to stop him. Considering we’re living in a post-atomic world heavily informed by the international weapons race the Manhattan Project kicked off, Oppenheimer is worth watching to understand how our current status came to be. As a film that also has plenty to say about the difference between executives and craftspeople in a time when that relationship is more fraught than it’s ever been, Oppenheimer is a cautionary reminder of how toxic that gulf can be in the worst circumstances. This is a story for all times, but it’s also an especially interesting one at this present time. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," There is a moment in Oppenheimer when they’re finally ready to test the bomb that all these brilliant scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico have been building for the past few years, when everything goes quiet. A stillness sets in as bright, searing light washes over everything. The onlookers stare into this mad inferno slathered in sunscreen, protective goggles strapped to their faces. And then, suddenly, the shock wave. A terrible thunderclap. It is at once a force of nature, and utterly unnatural. As the climax to a film about the creation of the first atomic bomb, it’s perfect. But it is not the climax. After Oppenheimer and his ragtag team of physicists, engineers, mathematicians and military officials successfully tests the bomb, we’re only two-thirds of the way through. The Third Act is only just beginning. I’ve spent a lot of time mulling Christopher Nolan’s latest film over in my mind since seeing it yesterday, and I would be lying if I told you that my thoughts were entirely formed. How do I feel about this strange historical biopic? Do I feel anything at all? I’m afraid the answer to that second question is . . . not really. This is a movie that made me think perhaps more than any other film I’ve seen this year, but I walked out of the theater last night and felt almost nothing at all. It would be true to say that I found it riveting start to finish, even though it’s slow and often hard to follow. But it would also be true to say that Oppenheimer is much too long and its delivery far too muddled to be considered anything more than a visually provocative biopic that seems less interested in character study than it does in setting a mood. Christopher Nolan likes to play tricks with chronology in his films, often to great success, but here Nolan’s stylistic and narrative habits are too jarring. Too inconsistent. This is not Tenet. I don’t want to spend time puzzling out timelines. For anyone not familiar with this particular history and its players, Oppenheimer is not just difficult to follow, but hard to care about. The big reveal—about two thirds of the way through the film—isn’t particularly shocking or compelling since the relationship between Straus (played with gusto by Robert Downey Jr.) and Oppenheimer (in a career-high for Cillian Murphy) is never well-established. Had Nolan tried to develop this relationship earlier on in the film, the twists and turns it takes later on might have meant something. But this is a film that seems uninterested entirely in telling a human story, and too interested by half in being clever about it. There are human moments, of course, here and there. Scenes scattered across the film’s three long hours where characters feel things or engage in some conflict with one another. But this collection of moments does not result in anything really resembling a coherent story. The cast is massive, filled with even more stars and cameos than Wes Anderson’s Asteroid City, which was chock-full of A-listers in C-list roles. It’s hard enough to keep track of all these scientists and politicians and generals and wives and mistresses without Nolan’s ridiculous flash-forwards and flash-backs. (And while Asteroid City was also mostly a collection of moments, those moments at least made me feel something in the end). Timelines are handled visually via the use of color and black-and-white film. We are anchored to before the Trinity tests and the end of WWII by color, and in the post-war era when it’s shot in black-and-white. But even here, Nolan breaks his own rules, leaving us unable to rely on desaturation to root us in events. It’s frustrating, mostly because the timeline-hopping feels unnecessary. Sure, most biopics are told chronologically, and I suppose there’s an argument to be made for why hopping around so much makes sense, but I’m not sure what that argument is. Nolan’s use of loud, overbearingly tense music to create a sense of tension is unearned here, in this mostly quiet movie about scientists concocting the most terrible invention of all time. Sure, cataclysm approaches, but at times it feels as though sonic discord is simply filling in for actual narrative tension. It’s a strange dissonance. Thrumming, building, bass-laden instrumentals, a rising sense of dread and menace, all leading to a crescendo in . . . a small hearing room, where we see Oppenheimer railroaded by his own government after the war, suffering through a humiliating hearing over his security clearance, far from the public eye. The problem is not the subject matter. The building of the bomb is compelling. The courtroom drama and the conflict that Oppenheimer faced after the war based on his opposition to a nuclear arms race is fascinating as well. So is his history of left-wing politics. It’s the delivery that leaves me a little cold, a little dizzy but not fun-dizzy. The twists that make a film like Interstellar so powerful simply don’t work in a true story quite as effectively. Or perhaps Nolan is just a little too predictable here. Cillian Murphy is wonderful. His performance has Oscars written all over it, and rightfully so. He makes the movie far more watchable than it otherwise would have been. Robert Downey Jr. is at last free of Tony Stark and reminds us what a damn fine actor he truly is when he’s given good material to work with. There are many damn fine actors here, including Emily Blunt as Kitty, Oppenheimer’s alcoholic, long-suffering wife. I’d list more, but there are too many to count. Some, like Rami Malek as Dr. Hill, are little more than throwaway cameos until suddenly they have a very important part to play—in and of itself a jarring approach that made me think “Ah, I guess they decided to give Malek some lines” which isn’t something you want to be thinking at that point in a movie. And there is also such a thing as too many recognizable faces in a film, though perhaps that’s a discussion for another time. Regardless, the performances are immaculate all the way around, from Matt Damon to Gary Oldman and everyone in-between. In the end, this is a film that seems to try very hard to be profound and powerful but cloaks so much of its story in camera tricks and loud, dialogue-burying music, that ultimately Nolan feels like his own worst enemy. His attention to detail is superb, of course, but one wonders if he even has the capacity to just play it straight from time to time, or if it’s all smoke and mirrors (fitting for the director of The Prestige). The final scene is haunting and powerful. The bomb itself, its ferocious plumage, the blast of sound long moments after its blinding eruption, was almost enough of a reason to see the film all by itself. But there’s a hollowness to it all that I can’t quite shake. Maybe we’re supposed to feel empty after watching such a grim history unfold. For Los Alamos history buffs and physicists, perhaps there is much to love here. I certainly did not hate this picture; I just wish that Nolan had taken a moment to make us care about these characters and their stories more, to help us understand the stakes, to get us to root for someone or even just against someone, rather than merely thrust us once again into his relentless pursuit of sound and fury.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Like many Americans, I was taught growing up that my grandfather was spared the burden of invading Japan and very likely dying because Harry Truman dropped a pair of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and ended the war. The main function of such stories is to justify a terrible war crime, but they also serve to impress upon the listener that we are quite directly children of the atom—that the threat of nuclear warfare is a foundational fact of our age and that many of us owe our existence to it. The Japanese, of course, tell a very different story—for them, the memory of devastated, irradiated cities and as many as 200,000 murdered civilians is every bit as foundational.  The first atomic bombs were the output of a colossal secret research program funded by the U.S. government and run by theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who gathered the best minds in his field near a ranch he owned in the New Mexico desert, where the army-built town of Los Alamos sprang up practically overnight. Oppenheimer is now the titular subject of a big-budget Hollywood release by Christopher Nolan that, alongside Greta Gerwig’s Barbie, has been charged with rescuing the film industry from its post-pandemic doldrums. Nolan, who is best known for puzzle boxes like Memento and Inception and for the Dark Knight trilogy, might seem an odd choice for a three-hour biopic that is mostly dialogue-driven and concerned as much with a McCarthy-era show trial as with the Manhattan Project, but Oppenheimer lives up to its considerable hype. That’s partly on the strength of the cast, which includes, among other luminaries, Cillian Murphy as the witty, obsessive, and sexually libertine Oppenheimer; Emily Blunt as his jaded and alcoholic wife, Kitty; Florence Pugh as his troubled Communist lover, Jean Tatlock; Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the army officer charged with overseeing the project; and Robert Downey Jr. as the cynical Atomic Energy Commission chairman and Oppenheimer-nemesis Lewis Strauss. But it’s also because Nolan clearly feels a deep investment in the moral stakes of his story and makes frequent use of bludgeoning audio cues and dreamlike glimpses of nuclear apocalypse to convey Oppenheimer’s torment as he ruminates on the bloody consequences of his theories.  A film depicting mostly quotidian human interaction is somehow paced like a thriller, and the tension never stops mounting, right up to the closing shot. When Groves, attempting to persuade one reluctant physicist to move to Los Alamos, calls the project “the most important fucking thing that’s ever happened,” you believe it. Not having read the Pulitzer-winning biography American Prometheus, on which Oppenheimer is based, I was surprised by how much of Nolan’s film is focused on Oppenheimer’s left-wing associations, which brought him to the brink of disgrace in the years following his national renown at the end of World War II. Oppenheimer himself was more of a pro-labor fellow traveler, but his brother, his lover, at one point his wife, and many of his closest friends and colleagues were card-carrying members of the Communist Party and thus subject to accusations of loyalty to the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, which in some cases might even have been accurate. The rich and tragic history of American leftism is very rarely depicted in blockbuster movies, but Oppenheimer is a striking exception—not since Warren Beatty’s Reds (1981) has a mainstream Hollywood historical epic portrayed American Communists with such sympathy and nuance. Even the basic structure of history may look very different from what audiences are used to. Many Americans are accustomed to thinking of World War II as the end of one era and the beginning of another, but for the American left, the war was a strange interregnum. Before Pearl Harbor, much of the American establishment and public was more frightened of communism than fascism, which is why a Jewish anti-fascist academic like Oppenheimer might find himself funneling money to the doomed Spanish Republicans via the Communist Party, since no one in Washington was going to help. After the defeat of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, the United States would almost immediately find itself in a Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, and soon any American with alleged left-wing associations could be blacklisted and driven from public life—even a figure as accomplished and admired as Oppenheimer. It was an aberration that for a period of less than four years in between Pearl Harbor and Hiroshima, the U.S. found itself allied with the Soviet Union in a global crusade against fascism—one in which Oppenheimer and his friends were not only aligned with their government but working with the highest levels of the U.S. military to produce a devastating weapon of war, which they hoped would be used against the Nazis.  The Manhattan Project, which represents both Oppenheimer’s career triumph and his most monstrous sin, occupies roughly the middle act of Nolan’s film. (I say “roughly” because, Nolan being Nolan, Oppenheimer’s chronology is fragmented and hard to summarize.) The successful Trinity detonation in New Mexico is as magnificent and terrifying on film as one might expect, but it’s no dramatic climax, and the subsequent bombings of Japan aren’t depicted on-screen at all. Instead, Oppenheimer is ultimately about how the U.S. government enlisted the talents of a group of mostly left-wing physicists it was never quite comfortable with in order to build a superweapon—one that it would never get the chance to use against the Nazis but that would be used against a nearly defeated Japan as a warning shot to the Soviets. The new, bipolar, frightfully dangerous world made possible by the atom bomb was a far cry from the harmonious global order its creators hoped and advocated for. Nolan’s Los Alamos is something of a paradox. In the middle of the desert, the federal government lavishly funds a tiny utopia, where brilliant minds—many of them left-wing Jews, often refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe—gather with their families, isolated from the war and from their own society in an austere science camp, all for the sake of designing and testing a killing machine. (Though the film neglects to mention it, the isolation wasn’t total; some civilian communities downwind of the Trinity test site were exposed to radiation and negative health effects in the years that followed.) It’s a strange context, in which certain social norms are permitted to break down, as when a woman with a degree in the sciences is permitted to work on the project instead of being relegated to the typing pool—though this doesn’t stop her male colleagues from idly speculating on the risks radiation might pose to her reproductive organs. Everyone in Los Alamos has dignified work, housing, and enough to eat, and they form a tight-knit community into which a lot of babies are born. For a few years, the town is a perverse realization of a Communist dream serving the dictates of an empire that is anything but Communist. By a strange coincidence, Oppenheimer is being released only weeks after Wes Anderson’s delightful Asteroid City, which portrays a fantasy military outpost in the Southwest clearly modeled on Los Alamos, down to the routine nuclear tests nearby. While Anderson’s town is fictional even within the context of the film, it reflects the same promise and peril as the real Los Alamos, functioning both as a commune for earnest young scientific minds and a military dictatorship hiding a terrible secret. In their own trademark styles, Anderson and Nolan both speak to the fascination that the Manhattan Project held for a generation of midcentury intellectuals made to reckon with the destructive potential of science and the unwieldy relationship between America’s best minds and its military-industrial complex. Nolan’s Oppenheimer wills Los Alamos into existence because of his personal connection to the land, and when the war is over he advocates for it to be returned to the local Indigenous population, which the military has no intention of doing; today, thousands of Americans live there, and the town is still dedicated to atomic research. In the confrontation between Oppenheimer’s high-minded justifications for his work and the military’s more cynical ends, Nolan leaves no doubt as to which prevailed. In the final moments of the film, Oppenheimer is seen confiding to an aged Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), whose own theories a generation earlier paved the way for the Manhattan Project, that he believes he may have started a chain reaction that will destroy the world. For those of us who grew up at the End of History, with the Soviet Union dissolved and both superpowers’ nuclear arsenals downsized and brought under tighter control, it might be tempting to conclude that Oppenheimer was too pessimistic and that the weapon he built could be managed responsibly and never used in warfare again. But Oppenheimer turns out to be uncomfortably timely. At no point since the end of the Cold War has nuclear war felt more plausible, as the daily clashes between a nuclear-armed Russia and a NATO-backed Ukraine remind us. Beyond literal nuclear warfare, we are faced with a range of existential dangers—pandemics, climate change, and perhaps artificial intelligence—that will be managed, or mismanaged, by small teams of scientific experts working in secret with little democratic accountability. The ideologies, affiliations, and personalities of those experts are likely to leave their stamp on history, and not in ways they themselves would necessarily wish. Oppenheimer’s dark prophecy may yet be fulfilled.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," As a Tomatometer-approved film journalist, a film like Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer presents me with my greatest challenge. Oppenheimer is not a ""rotten"" film, though this is the designation I will inevitably assign it when I wrap up this review and hit the send button to submit to our dear friends at Rotten Tomatoes.  Oppenheimer is not a rotten film, a fact to which anyone with even a single moment of a cinematic background would testify. If nothing else, Nolan's technical prowess is undeniable even if I more often than not find him to be one of the most frustrating filmmakers alive.  However, I feel obligated to call Oppenheimer a rotten film because I simply cannot possibly recommend it. It's a decent film, maybe even a good film, crying out to be a truly great one and already assigned greatness because when it comes down to it Nolan knows how to awe us just enough that the dazzle outweighs the desperation.  Oppenheimer is not the film it could have been and should have been had Nolan checked his ego at the door, his artistic flourishes at the front gate, and if he had only enlisted someone to help him write the story he's trying so desperately to tell.  I've already accepted I will be in the minority here. Many are already pronouncing Oppenheimer to be one of the best films of the year. For me? It's not even the best film opening this weekend.  At a far too long running time of three hours practically on the dot, Oppenheimer is a sprawling techno-epic about J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the complex and conflicted father of the atomic bomb via the at the time secretive Manhattan Project. Nolan also writes here, though his story is at least inspired by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's American Prometheus. There are, rest assured, moments of absolute brilliance here. These moments make the overall experience of Oppenheimer all the more frustrating as Nolan lays down layer after layer, story after story but ends up with a film that feels like the Winchester mansion in Kentucky that ultimately goes lots of places and nowhere simultaneously.  The A-list cast here is for the most part terrific, led by Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer's icy demeanor and quiet brilliance. Murphy's the kind of actor who's seldom front-and-center in a film, though he's been a frequent collaborator of Nolan's in such films as The Dark Knight trilogy, Dunkirk, and Inception. As a man, Oppenheimer is not a particularly compelling character himself - it's his story that makes him compelling and despite Nolan's ability to make a compelling motion picture he has yet to figure out how to tell a compelling story.  Initially, the buzz was that Nolan was crafting Oppenheimer to be something resembling a horror film. It's not, of course. In fact, I'd say that Oppenheimer even falls short of being a thriller. It's certainly not a documentary. Ludwig Göransson's mind-fu**ing original score practically demands that we understand as much. Instead, Oppenheimer is more along the lines of a historic drama with obvious tragic elements.  The film is largely framed around three interweaving narratives - Oppenheimer's 1954 security hearing, 1959's Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) testimony at during a confirmation hearing for President Eisenhower's cabinet, and Oppenheimer's very precise passion for physics and perhaps not quite as obvious passion for temperamental women.  As is nearly always true in a Nolan picture, the women here are mostly secondary. Olivia Thirlby has a relatively brief but satisfying turn as Manhattan Project scientist Lilli Hornig, though both Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are too often reduced to weepy and tired stereotypes. Oppenheimer starts off promisingly. There are scenes here that are most certainly among the best he's created to date, though eventually he begins to indulge himself and it's Ludwig Göransson's score that begins to express the emotions here that no one else dares to speak or feel or express in any other way.  Still, it's the fact that Nolan is able to assemble such a remarkable ensemble with so many satisfying moments that makes it even more frustrating that Oppenheimer is so damn unsatisfying. Downey Jr. does some of his most satisfying work in years and reminds us what an incredibly fine actor he is as the cagey Strauss. Blunt manages to shine despite being woefully underdeveloped. David Dastmalchian is a scene-stealer for sure. The same could be said for David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi. For my money, it's Matt Damon who really hits it out of the ballpark as Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr.  Ultimately, however, where Oppenheimer really falls short is in its humanity and Nolan's complete avoidance of it. Nolan has never had a gift for bringing out the humanity within his stories, a fact that works in some films while falling dismally short in others. Oppenheimer desperately needs us to feel something about Oppenheimer the man - love? hate? I don't care what, but after three hours I didn't feel like I knew him any better and I was absolutely sure I didn't care. While Oppenheimer seems to be trying to present Oppenheimer as morally conflicted, that internal conflict never comes to life whether Nolan is serving up what feels like purely functional sexuality or brief, almost disrespectful, Japan references that fail to capture the magnitude of a humanity forever impacted by Oppenheimer's actions.  I have to say it again. Oppenheimer is not a rotten film though it's not the film it could have been and should have been. I'm also not convinced, not even one iota, that it's the film that Nolan intended to make.  If Greta Gerwig can manage to make a plastic doll feel human, why can't Nolan do the same for the father of the atomic bomb?",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," It's dark outside the window as my late-night train carries me home. I see occasional flashes of red light, and the backseat tray table, upon which I type this review of ""Oppenheimer,"" won't stop shaking. So now my iPad is sitting in my lap. Though that isn't entirely still, because I'm still vibrating a bit, not from the Amtrak car, but from excitement at what I've witnessed. This isn't some attempt at self-importance, but I do like to add a bit of gravitas to the films that really excite me. Some movies are fine. Some are quite rotten (I've recently suffered through a viewing of ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2""). But others, my readers, they are nothing less than a delight. A cold slice of Mississippi mud pie on a hot summer's day delight. And I struggle a bit here because this is the part of my formula where I tell y'all what happens in the movie to set the stage without any serious spoilers. I consider that part the task assigned me -- to translate the art of the director's project as best I can, and write something interesting about it. But since ""Oppenheimer"" is based on historical events, the line between spoiler and mere summary has been reduced to ash. I'll try my best though. Bear with me until I get to the next part of my formula, which is the analysis of what I've witnessed. ""Oppenheimer"" shows the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who gave the world the atomic bomb and ended World War II on a morose note. Well, as morose a note as can come after war. The film isn't told in a strict chronological order, but rather bounces back and forth through the decades of Oppenheimer's life. We see him in college, being interrogated by a government board, leading the team that assembled the atomic bomb, teaching as a professor in California and fornicating. Some parts of the story are shot in black and white. Others are shown in full color. But all of it looks phenomenal, including, yes, the explosions. But these aren't Michael Bay explosions used to excite the audience in between thinly-written pieces of narrative. Forgive me for sounding a little pretentious, but these are artistic explosions, used to illustrate the raw power that was beyond even the human imagination, save for a few extraordinary gifted intellectuals. The story of ""Oppenheimer"" is one of scientific might, the uncontrollable urge to explore no matter the consequences because evil people (from the Allied perspective) were racing to do the same thing, both during, and after World War II. History has already told the audience what happens. America made and detonated the bomb, twice using it on civilian population centers in Japan, killing hundreds of thousands of people. Viewers will watch Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his team take this bomb from hypothetical to fatal reality across three hours. And then they'll see tragedy, consequences, and the ethical questions that haunted minds for decades to come. Murphy carries such a monumental weight throughout ""Oppenheimer,"" and his performance matches the intensity of a man who said he had ""become death"" and feels the guilt associated with being a potential world destroyer. He sleeps around because even as a scientist there are elements of passion that make him a bit of a rock star. Robert Downey Jr. proves he is more than Iron Man by playing a petty and slighted man named Lewis Strauss. It'll be a little shocking to see the man who spent more than a decade as Marvel's most-recognizable hero now playing an antagonist, but he's so skilled at being the villain of the story that folks won't even blink. ""Oppenheimer"" is packed to the gills with big names, and everyone from Matt Damon to Florence Pugh swings for the moon. This is a tale of disastrous consequences full of lessons on man's folly, and they all understood the assignment. But the real treat in all of this is a narrative arc that feels so carefully fused together, it's as though Nolan spent the last 30 years knitting a sweater stitch by stitch. Not one scene feels superfluous or out of place. The only flaw I could find in this picture, and it's a small one, is that Emily Blunt, who played Kitty Oppenheimer, just didn't seem to have any real chemistry with Murphy. But man alive does she shine during her witness testimony at the end. Yes, this is a long movie. And yes, I tweet often that I long for the days when stories being told in 90 minutes were more common. But Nolan's film is worth it. ""Oppenheimer"" is weighty, it's tragic, it's art. Dammit, this is everything cinema should be. Now go watch it. And then go watch ""Barbie."" Please use your ticket-purchasing power to show Hollywood how ravenous the American consumer is for original stories. And speaking of hungry, I'm going to go buy a whoopie pie from the cafe car. It's been almost 12 hours since I've eaten anything, and I'm ravenous.

"Jul 21, 2023",Both a technical marvel and a hell of a sociopolitical bio-drama&#44; Oppenheimer is indeed a major Nolan banger&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," During a 1965 CBS News interview with the real-life J. Robert Oppenheimer, he was asked if his country’s use of the bomb was necessary after all those years. The famed “father of the atomic bomb,” known for his endless wit, tempered cadence, and confident personality, looked entirely defeated. “I have not a very good answer to this question,” he said. How fitting that the film made about his life and most infamous work does not give simple answers as well. Oppenheimer, once dubbed as ‘Prometheus’ after giving the world the power to destroy themselves, is an ambiguous figure. His moral convictions are hard to place in a box. His ideas, political leanings, and even his moral boundaries are always in constant flux. How can a film ever capture the full essence of such a man? Director Christopher Nolan (Inception, The Dark Knight) tries anyway, and hails Oppenheimer the “most important person who ever lived.” It’s because no one has ever made a scientific breakthrough with the potential to obliterate humanity, and this chilling premise alone makes Oppenheimer’s life a story worth telling. Nolan, in his characteristic style, brings this story to life by dividing the film into black-and-white scenes for objective events and color scenes for subjective ones. What distinguishes this film from Nolan’s other work is his total immersion in subjectivity, evident in the narrative, visual, and audio elements, particularly in the color scenes. Unexpected chemical explosions can interrupt a quiet conversation by the riverside. A blinding flash of light can abruptly engulf an entire room. These sudden jolts of terror guide us through Cillian Murphy’s riveting performance. Murphy is the tortured heart and soul of the film and he’s one of a kind in it. The capstone event of the color section is the Trinity Test scene, the first-ever successful test of the atomic bomb. This is what the film is building towards from the minute it opens – and what follows is nothing short of stunning. It’s a jaw-dropping moment that conjures an out-of-body experience in the cinema.  The dropping of the bomb elicits a blend of horror and astonishment. The event is the culmination of an hour and a half of escalating tension. Nolan also adds the possibility of a disastrous outcome; the annihilation of the atmosphere due to a chain reaction that never stops. Never mind that we know what happens and its consequences, those 60 seconds before the bomb drops is the most nail-biting sequence of the year – and this year also includes a Mission: Impossible film. The black and white scenes (which, by the way, look beautiful on IMAX) focus more on Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and specifically about his vindictiveness with Oppenheimer. Downey gives a stellar performance. He embodies Strauss with a level of gravitas. Relatable, but not too much. Charming, but clearly has some skeletons in the closet. His scenes with Alden Ehrenreich are a masterclass in dumping exposition because they not only move the story forward but endear us to their point-of-views. On the other hand, the limited screen time of Florence Pugh in the film, coupled with Nolan’s fast-paced editing style, only contributed to a desire for more of her character. Emily Blunt’s portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer is particularly impressive, if only for the third act. Her persistent encouragement of her husband to fight and not martyr himself added much-needed depth. She felt the most grounded and pragmatic character in a world bereft with self-interested politicians and morally confused scientists.  Even with the remarkable bomb test, the events that unfold after it are even more captivating. Following the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the guilt of all those involved began to creep in like an insidious shadow. Nolan delves into the politics and bureaucratic machinations that punished Oppenheimer for his miracle. The onset of the Cold War contributed to the rise of McCarthyism, resulting in accusations of communist sympathies and an indictment of Oppenheimer’s associations from many years ago. Scenes in a conference room and senate chamber take over the film. Despite their ordinary appearance, these locations are charged with intense dialogue that hit you with the force of gunshots. Ludwig Göransson’s stunning musical score heightens the tension, creating an atmosphere akin to the impending explosion of a bomb as the music, quite literally, makes your seat shake. It’s like if David Fincher’s The Social Network had an editing style akin to a thousand chemical bombs being thrown at your face every minute. The film’s critique of government surveillance and interventions based on baseless communist allegations resonates strongly, especially when paralleled with the Philippines’ unjust vilification of its brilliant minds in science and medicine. At the same time, the ease with which Oppenheimer is swallowed up by the American military industrial complex and political system serves as a cautionary tale. I’m pleased to see Nolan delving into this topic with greater explicitness. It’s what I felt was missing in his greater films like The Dark Knight, and especially in his lesser ones like Tenet. The film boasts an impressive ensemble cast that’s hard to wrap your head around. It includes the likes of Rami Malek, an Oscar-winning actor who accepted just a few minutes of screen time, and Matt Damon, who, in a different movie, could have easily earned him Best Supporting Actor raves. Other standouts include a revitalized Josh Hartnett, a fiery Benny Safdie, and Tom Conti, who unexpectedly became a crowd favorite (in both of my screenings) with his portrayal of Albert Einstein.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Nolan’s latest is about the man (played by a bravura Cillian Murphy), who changed the course of human history, and his complicated relationship with his own legacy. It’s an effective ‘biopic’ to the extent that it refuses to blandly blaze through bullet points and rattle off a set of highlights from his life. Instead, it takes you inside his mind. Often quite literally. Using Oppenheimer’s 1954 trial and cross-examination as a narrative device – which took place years after the horrific 1945 Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings that cost over 200,000 lives – the film takes us through his early years. We’re introduced to young Robert studying his way through Europe’s most renowned institutions. He’s the kind of brilliant mind, who casually learns conversational German over a few months so he can deliver a lecture on quantum physics in Germany. Cursed with knowledge and burdened by genius, he sees the matter and atoms that make up the world around him. Robert quite literally sees the vibrancy of life. One fellow academic compares it to “being able to hear the music”. To give us a glimpse into his singular mind, Jennifer Lame’s visceral editing intercuts Robert’s conversations with people, with visuals of hauntingly beautiful explosions, collapsing stars, and chemical reactions. That is until years later, when he witnesses his work leading to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, leaving him forever changed. His life’s work - the theory and possibilities he’s held so dear becomes a horrific reality. In an instant, ideas and innovation become atrocity. From that moment on, he no longer sees glimpses of life, atoms, or matter. All he sees is death and destruction. The dense first hour of Oppenheimer is a task to follow, as we’re assaulted with information and thrown into a frenzy of names, places, and events in quick, furious succession. Robert’s teaching days of introducing quantum mechanics to the US, his proximity to the communist party, his turbulent relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), him getting involved with the war against the Nazis, and being brought on to the Manhattan Project. All together. All at once. A film that demands all of you, in order to keep up. Oppenheimer is not a movie that tells a story as much as one that expects you to know that story in order to entirely engage with it. It’s why Oppenheimer is Nolan’s least accessible, and perhaps bravest, movie to date. Key to his glorious filmmaking style is that even if you don’t follow every beat of his movies, there are always concepts, ideas and worlds to relish and be taken by. They work on multiple levels. The broad strokes of his films work for wider audiences, whilst also offering further layers and artistry to engage with for those wanting to go deeper. Put simply, even idiots love Inception. Heady psychological thrills aside, Memento has an excellent central gimmick to grasp onto. Tenet, for all its delirium, is an immensely engaging puzzle within a slick action movie. Even Dunkirk had booming scale as an immersive war movie that placed us on the front lines. But Oppenheimer has no such genre facade to hide behind. Instead, the film’s massive-ness comes from its overpowering, bone-shaking use of sound, and the implications of this story of how Robert Oppenheimer gave mankind the tools of our own destruction. Instead, the film works best when it’s at its simplest, particularly in the stellar last hour, where the sprawling, ambitious narrative comes to its grand crescendo. Walking out of the film, I didn’t know whether to be taken by how much Nolan wants to challenge his audience or be put off by his refusal to give us more digestible storytelling. To be dejected by how much detail there is to get lost in and be overwhelmed by, or be impressed by how much stays with you despite that. The thunderous craft, the rich artistry, the command over our heart rates, the tremendous cast full of unlikely, familiar faces. David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi, Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence, Alden Ehrenreich as Rich Feynman, an excellent Tom Conti as Albert Einstein - arguably responsible for the film's finest scenes. It was also magnificent to see Robert Downey Jr (RDJ) the actor again, here as “antagonist” Lewis Strauss. It’s a very curious casting move to have RDJ – a man who spent the last decade playing a superhero, who’s an egotistical genius – here playing a man, who has all of the ego and none of the genius, but is cursed to be surrounded by them. Not to mention a commanding Emily Blunt as Robert’s wife Kitty Oppenheimer. While I remain unimpressed by Nolan’s female characters, Kitty gets one of the film’s most rousing, crowd-pleasing scenes which is an absolute joy to watch. At its core, Oppenheimer is about the messy, deeply unnerving intersection between science and politics. How selfish, self-serving leaders are awarded unbridled power. How wars and governments corrupt, contaminate, and bastardize science. Would you truly want peace if your life’s pathbreaking work has been to build a bomb? Is it all in service of your country, or is a world on the brink of war merely the ideal circumstance to enable your work? To answer these questions, Nolan examines one pathetic US government tragedy after the other. The atomic bomb was built to fight the Nazis. But with Hitler defeated, it’s almost as if America’s leaders had a shiny new toy with no use for it. So they imagined one. “It's no longer Hitler that's the greatest threat to the world. It's our work” someone says to Robert. In one scene, a group of leading US officials casually discuss which Japanese city to eradicate off the face of the Earth. One of them gently offers that it shouldn’t be Kyoto because “it’s a beautiful city. My wife and I honeymoon there”. To see such soul-shattering loss of life approached with such heartless indifference is heartbreaking. Arguably the most memorable moment of the film comes just after The Trinity Test – the first successful test of the atomic bomb. After much bated breath, as soon as it goes off, we don’t see the explosion itself, but merely the reaction on Oppenheimer’s face. It’s a moment of relief. Of seeing his genius recognised. His theory made reality. Similarly, we’re never made to see the horrors of Hiroshima itself, but merely the look on his face as he watches the images of the aftermath and the destruction he wrought. I did find it curious, however, that the film’s clearest objective is to have us feel for Robert and how his government turned on him, and not the staggering loss of life in Japan. Through its blistering tale of destruction, Oppenheimer deconstructs the idea of what a “biopic” should be. A statement of facts peppered with context and perspective? Or something greater? The end of a conversation, or the beginning of one? In asking us a series of important questions, Christopher Nolan crafts a piece of cinema that may not serve as spectacle, but it certainly is epic.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Much like every film certification board in the world, the one in India is supposed to certify a film, thereby judging the kind of audience that should watch it. If it gets a “U” certificate, then everyone can watch the film. If it gets a “U/A” certificate, then the film can be viewed by underage kids if they are in the presence of an adult. The “A” certificate means that only adults can watch them, i.e., 18 years of age and above. Then there’s an “S” certificate, which means restricted access and is reserved for special cases only. Now, the CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) is governed by acts and rules dating back to the 1950s and 1980s. In the past, it was used quite smartly so as to not hamper the artistic vision of filmmakers and leave it to the audience to judge their work. Things changed, and this board turned into the moral police and started demanding cuts, disclaimers, blurring of frames, muting expletives, and obstructing moving images with black bars. There was some pushback. But since the system pursued its aim to infantilize the Indian audience, after a point, we gave up. And that has led to the butchered version of Oppenheimer. Written and directed by Christopher Edward Nolan, Oppenheimer tells the story of the titular theoretical physicist as he goes from being a student with murderous intentions to a cheating husband, the father of the atomic bomb, an anti-national, and a broken husk of a man filled with regret. Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus, the biopic aims to highlight Oppenheimer’s genius, his interest in creating something exceptional, his patriotism, his penchant for charity, and his ability to stick to his ideals regardless of the circumstances. But instead of exclusively glorifying him, the film delves into his infidelity, his arrogance, and his martyr complex, which he thinks absolves him of his sins. In addition to that, Nolan tries to paint a nuanced portrait of Oppenheimer’s life by showing the kind of relationship he had with his family, his friends, his love interests, and his colleagues, and how all of their lives were irrevocably changed due to his actions. However, to truly understand these complexities, you have to immerse yourself in the story, in the emotions, and in Nolan’s vision—something that is made impossible by the tampering with the film by the CBFC. I risk running into spoiler-filled territory if I start to describe how Oppenheimer has been hacked up, so I won’t do that. If you think that this is a pretty straightforward biopic about detonating the atomic bomb and hence can’t be spoiled, it’s not. Nolan, cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, and editor Jennifer Lame have gone to great lengths to differentiate between the factual recollection of Oppenheimer’s life and the comparatively memory-based recollection of his journey. The black-and-white scenes, titled “Fusion,” are fact-based, and the ones in color, titled “Fission,” are rather memory-based. And the juxtaposition of these color-coded conversations is supposed to give a somewhat complete picture of Oppenheimer’s problematic rise and Lewis Strauss’ jealousy and eventual betrayal. But regardless of the color, all of these scenes have a very distracting “Smoking Kills” sign on them. Since the characters smoke every two seconds, that sign keeps blinking, thereby completely breaking the sense of immersion. I am aware that smoking is harmful. I know that Julius Robert Oppenheimer died of throat cancer because he was a chain smoker. I can both see and hear the hideous “No Smoking” advertisement before the beginning of the movie and during the interval. What’s the point of putting that disclaimer there? This question goes out to the CBFC for making such a demand and to the distributors and producers for agreeing to the demands. You know what? You’ll probably get used to the anti-smoking sign. But what about the black bars, the blurring, and the weirdly zoomed-in camera angles to mask the nudity? Yes, that’s right! There are black bars on the frame during some very pivotal moments where Nolan illustrates the concepts of creation and destruction and visualizes the level of disgust Kitty Oppenheimer felt towards Julius and how exposed Julius felt while being questioned about his relationship with Jean Tatlock. Those moments are also a reminder of how Oppenheimer misused his intellect and led to the death of a woman who had a whole life ahead of her. None of that is evident in this “family-friendly” version of Nolan’s film, though. Our view is obstructed by a panel of people who are against cinema, people who are against freedom of expression, and people who think they are above Nolan (which, FYI, they are not). It’s ironic that Oppenheimer is about creating something substantial, provocative, disturbing, and life-changing and then watching it be misused in such a way that its consequences are felt to this day. I can’t even begin to imagine how Nolan, Murphy, Pugh, Blunt, and all those who have tirelessly worked on this magnum opus would feel if they laid their eyes on this Indian version of the film. It’s disrespectful. It’s disgusting. It’s repugnant. I am well aware of the hordes of people who think that adult scenes shouldn’t exist in movies. I am sure that some people will say that they could’ve just cut out those scenes instead of covering them up with black bars, black VFX, and blurs. And I am also sure that some will say that the distasteful meddling doesn’t take up the whole movie, and the rest of it is just fine. Firstly, if you don’t want explicit scenes in movies, don’t watch movies with such scenes. You can watch the ones that don’t have them. Websites like IMDb have parental guides that tell you if a movie does or doesn’t have anything explicit in it. Read it and decide for yourself. Who are you to tell me that I shouldn’t watch a adult scene that has been put there by the director for the reason that he deems creative? Who are you to stop me from deciding if said creative reason is valid or not? Secondly, if you are cutting out scenes from movies, you are hindering the vision of the director. What’s the point of releasing such a film? Just let it be, or don’t release the film at all. Thirdly, if you are okay with some censorship, you are giving the thumbs-up to all censorship. You are saying that it’s alright to fool around with a filmmaker’s work. Based on what? Some misplaced sense of moral superiority? There’s the irony again! A significant chunk of Oppenheimer is about ego and morality. Men all over the globe wage war against each other and pat themselves on the back for creating something insanely destructive. With time, things change, and those acts of heroism are considered war crimes. Oppenheimer’s decisions and actions are judged by a group of people who probably haven’t seen the inside of a lab. Going by the portrayals of Pash, Borden, Nichols, Robb, Gray, and, of course, Strauss, they were involved in dubious activities themselves. But since it was easy to dunk on Oppenheimer, given his association with the atomic bomb, they did it. That’s not to say that Oppenheimer didn’t have a sense of moral superiority. However, as per the subjective iteration of the events, he regretted doing what he did while the others didn’t. So, do you see the parallels between this commentary on ethics and virtue and how it is applicable to the aforementioned censorship? Those who are making judgment calls from their ivory towers have hands that aren’t clean. They are allowing propaganda films to promote all kinds of discrimination and then beaming it into every household in the country. Then what gives them the right to decide what should stay and what should go from a film by someone as significant as Christopher Nolan? Even though I have expressed my frustration and anger towards the concerned authorities for absolutely ruining Oppenheimer, I still don’t think it’s enough. I adore Nolan’s work. I was extremely excited to watch this film. And I can’t digest the fact that the experience of witnessing a Nolan film for the first time has been tarnished in such a heinous fashion. I can’t in good conscience recommend this to anyone residing in India. If you live in some other country where the certification board doesn’t consider itself to be the censor board, please go and watch it, and feel free to share your thoughts with us.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," When certain directors reach the pinnacle of success there is the temptation to settle into a comfort zone where they repeat their same formulas. Then you have a case like Christopher Nolan, who decides to push even further and make a grand, bold gesture like “Oppenheimer.” Perhaps only Nolan could be given a $100 million budget to make what amounts to a stirring intellectual drama centered on questions of science, politics, the fate of the species and a great man’s personal battles, while generating the same amount of hype as his mega-budget blockbusters. The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, certainly deserves a massive canvas. It straddles the key moments of 20th century American history, while raising questions that still haunt us. His shadow looms over the fact that we have the capacity to destroy ourselves. When we hear about the fear of the ongoing war in Ukraine having the potential of turning into a nuclear conflagration between the world powers, here is the seed of such a situation on one man’s chalkboard. What first strikes about the film is the face of Cillian Murphy, who instantly captures that alluring, wide-eyed stare of Oppenheimer’s. We first meet him as a young physics prodigy always living in his head. He’s impulsive, acting out against a Cambridge professor by attempting to leave him a poisoned apple (a true anecdote). By the 1930s he’s a full professor at Berkeley, making a name for himself as a theorist of quantum mechanics and nuclear physics. The world outside is rapidly changing as well, with fascism on the march in Europe and the intellectual class attracted to radical leftist politics and Marxism. Oppenheimer contributes to the anti-fascist cause during the Spanish Civil War, becoming lovers with the radical Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). He then settles down with the more focused though no less complicated Kitty (Emily Blunt). World War II then erupts and the U.S. is pulled in after the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor in 1941. Oppenheimer’s dabbling in certain political circles has to be put aside when he’s approached by Lt. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to head the Manhattan Project, the military’s program to develop a nuclear weapon before the Germans. Instantly, Oppenheimer knows he wants to base the lab in a then sparse mesa in New Mexico named Los Alamos. As cinema “Oppenheimer” is the kind of serious, epic biography that was nearly going extinct. Nolan conjures the bygone days of movies such as Oliver Stone’s “Nixon” or Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X.” These are massive projects that encompass a historical figure’s entire life, with enough room for the intimacies and ideas that formed the person, told with exhilarating visual creativity. Nolan’s particular style of filmmaking with grandiose photography by regular collaborator Hoyte Van Hoytema (who shot on 70mm IMAX stock), visceral music by Ludwig Göransson and practical visual effects is all here, but at the service of a story that’s more about psychological standoffs, battles of will and wit, raging egos and the ambitions of doing great things at high costs. It signals growth as well for the director, who has been building up to this moment with his famous brand of brainy entertainments. The obsession with scientific processes and details in “Inception” and the cryptic “Tenet,” not to mention the cosmic adventure “Interstellar,” which found eloquent metaphors in relativity, explain why Nolan would be attracted to Oppenheimer as a subject. He bases his screenplay on the biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, and it can feel like it gripped him so much he attempted to channel all 721 pages.  “Oppenheimer” never feels like a dry recap of a subject’s life. Nolan goes for a truly imaginative, cinematically poetic experience. Oppenheimer’s thoughts, dreams and fears are evoked through images of crackling elements or swirling atoms. The literal implications of a calculation are imagined. When Oppenheimer meets with Albert Einstein (Toni Conti) to discuss a warning by Manhattan Project team member Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) that the resulting weapon could set off a chain reaction which might ignite the atmosphere, such a nightmarish image is presented on screen. The vast New Mexico desert is almost a metaphor for the immensity of what Oppenheimer and his team of scientists are attempting in this makeshift town, where Groves keeps a close eye and there’s always the threat someone will snoop into the group’s liberal tendencies. Oppenheimer does utter his famous “destroyer of worlds” quote from the Bhagavad Gita, while in bed with Tatlock when she finds a book of Sanskrit on his shelf. Like Steven Spielberg, Nolan admirably uses his clout to make the kind of project that a lesser known director would never get greenlit. Previous attempts at this story have been flops, such as the terrible 1989 film “Fat Man and Little Boy.” Only Jon H. Else’s superb 1981 Oscar-nominated documentary, “The Day After Trinity” deserves to be seen as prep for this opus.  More than special effects, this is a film about ideas and being swept by historical currents. Oppenheimer’s world is one where people were seriously debating the merits of revolutionary socialism, while feeling the call to fight Nazism. Idealism was not a joke and to support a labor union meant potentially being tagged as a “commie.” Among the Los Alamos scientists, questions of formulas and calculations are as riveting as a crime thriller. And, what about the much hyped sequence where Nolan opted for practical effects to recreate the Trinity test? The hyper realism of the moment has a great effect because of its eeriness. It’s the closest a viewer will ever get to seeing what it must have actually been like to watch the world’s first nuclear device detonated. The sound design brilliantly sticks to authenticity, as the explosion itself occurs in silence, until the shock wave hits the witnesses with a trembling, ferocious roar. It never looks like a gargantuan CGI creation, but like something real and tangible.  Nolan then turns the story into a moral crisis of mythical proportions. After Hiroshima is bombed and the device is confirmed to work, Oppenheimer gives what should be a rousing speech at Los Alamos. As he speaks the lens quivers and he imagines a nuclear blast consuming his audience. The scientist has accomplished much, but now he is at the service of the state. Fame instantly gives him the tag of an “American Prometheus,” but when he confesses to President Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman) that he feels he has blood on his hands, the president dismisses him as a “crybaby.” Oppenheimer isn’t recast as a saint. Instead the material dives into the complications of the situation. Here is a highly intelligent man still caught off-guard by the cutthroat nature of politics, a lesson he learns even harder when he becomes the target of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), head of the Atomic Energy Commission, who years later orchestrates the smearing of Oppenheimer out of sheer, petty envy. Only Kitty sees the severity of the dangers ahead, but Oppenheimer is so trapped by his own self that he walks right into the fire. This final battle constitutes the film’s lengthy, intense third act. “Oppenheimer” boasts a massive cast, with names like Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek and Josh Hartnett playing excellent smaller roles. But the entire film truly belongs to Cillian Murphy, who is in nearly every scene and creates an Oppenheimer who says much with just his stares. He is a man living forever in his mind, though capable of leading a group and commanding a project. Flawed in his sexual escapades with someone like Tatlock, while lamenting he and Kitty are terrible parents, brilliant but tortured by having created a weapon of mass destruction, Murphy makes every element of the character come alive. Over the years he has played various roles in Nolan films, going back to his deranged Scarecrow in “Batman Begins,” but here he delivers something possibly awards-worthy. The iconic becomes terribly human. That Nolan achieves such dramatic depths with a movie competing with “Barbie” at the box office is in itself an achievement. “Oppenheimer” is three hours long, and some viewers may find the third act particularly taxing, but it may just call you back for another viewing. Nolan, typically a master of suspense, grips with a film that is about great minds put at the service of immense destruction. The story told in these frames is about a life lived but also about the consequences still hovering over us today.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," EDITOR’S NOTE: This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, films like Oppenheimer wouldn’t exist. Everywhere you look inside and outside of Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, there are layers upon layers of risks. The film’s depicted history of scientific discovery and governmental decisions leans heavily on creating tension in mere ideas, let alone when the previously theorized achievements come alive. Likewise, shooting a massive and deadly serious three-hour historical epic in large format film and dropping it in the sunny skies of the summer box office season (and on the heels of a pair of entertainment industry strikes, no less) comes with its own set of daunting prospects. Based on the very comprehensive Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin K. Sherwin, Oppenheimer follows the academic origins and national service career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by longtime Nolan collaborator and Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy. The film introduces Robert in the late 1920s along his international path of meeting and collaborating with formative Nobel Prize winners (including Kenneth Branagh’s Niels Bohr, James D’Arcy’s Patrick Blackett, and Matthias Schweighöfer’s Werner Heisenberg) and storied institutions before he settles on a professor position at UC-Berkeley introducing quantum physics and quantum mechanics to the country’s academia next door to yet another Nobel Prize winner in Ernest Lawrence (the long-lost Josh Hartnett). These early segment arcs of burgeoning clout in Oppenheimer begin to tie threads of risk-filled collaborations, partnerships, and associations for the central figure. Outside of his university work, Oppenheimer’s leftist politics and anti-fascist actions nearly match his more extroverted brother Frank (Dylan Arnold of TV’s You) have him pegged as a potentially dangerous communist, especially when he begins a friendship with translator Haakon Chevalier (House of the Dragon’s Jefferson Hall) and a torrid extramarital affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh of Don’t Worry Darling), a registered member of the Communist Party of the United States of America. Taking this hazardous risk of collaborations further is the arduous undertaking of the famous Manhattan Project during World War II that was tasked to Oppenheimer by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, stepping up from Paul Newman’s portrayal of the figure from 1989’s Fat Man and Little Boy). Plenty of folks in the U.S. government questioned trusting such a dangerous and important project demanding security and efficiency on the shoulders of a more-theoretical man like Oppenheimer and his leanings. The effort to win the war was one thing, but the scientific risks were exponentially more grave. Oppenheimer loves to repeat the mantra “Theory will only get you so far,” meaning that lofty and dangerous hypotheses must be tested and confirmed before being handed over to a larger agency or, worse, unleashed on citizens and soldiers during wartime. The urgent race to beat the Germans to the atomic bomb punch rushed the engineered mashup of volatile explosives and rare radioactive elements that had the chance to ignite the entire planet’s atmosphere on fire instead of its intended target. Like the novel, the movie aptly and allegorically links this leadership peril of Robert to the cautionary Greek myth of Prometheus with a misinterpreted drizzle of the Bhagavad Gita’s Hindu scripture of “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Oppenheimer spends the bulk of its sizable production design work by Ruth De Jong (no stranger to the desert after Nope) recreating the isolated base at Los Alamos, New Mexico and building suspense towards the famous Trinity test that would confirm all their scientific confidence or fears. As many know, the result of the three-year and $3 billion Manhattan Project was the development of the first weapons of mass destruction. That technology, heroically credited to Robert, became something that could now be replicated, stolen by espionage, or developed en masse here and abroad, changing military might forever. After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the gravity of his work’s outcomes weighed heavily on Oppenheimer where he advocated in the 1950s to avert nuclear proliferation and avoid an arms race and received harsh judgment for expressing divergent honest opinions. For its three hours, Oppenheimer takes a clandestine route to portray these behind-the-scenes personal and professional relationships of the titular figure. The film uses two main settings as plot moorings to present, rehash, and expose all the supposed skeletons in everyone’s closet. The first is the closed-door 1954 security hearing where Robert, his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt, in the unforgiving the wife-and-mother-at-home slot), and the parade of project partners from his past are badgered with questions before a kangaroo court led by Jason Clarke’s Atomic Energy Commission special counsel Roger Robb. The second setting is five years later during the 1959 U.S. Senate hearings for the appointment of former Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss (an excellent Robert Downey, Jr.) as the Secretary of Commerce in President Eisenhower’s Cabinet. Shot in black and white to set it apart, Strauss and his aides and allies (including renewed bites at the apple for Solo’s Alden Ehrenreich and Chronicle’s Dane DeHaan) are circling the wagons to bury Oppenheimer further after years of revealed confrontational history. This is where Christopher Nolan takes over the saga’s heft and adds his own talent and hubris. Rather than a traditional chronology, Oppenheimer twists this lengthy unrolled scroll of powerful history and folds it like origami with Nolan’s penchant for toying with multiple timelines. The director’s cast and his trusty 4-time cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema stage a host of meetings and character interactions across decades that showcase the troublesome bonds and the pensive issues that would plague the rest of Robert’s life (and the movie). This overall presentation of technique in Oppenheimer is both a triumph and a drawback for audiences. From a performance standpoint, Oppenheimer granted a great deal of latitude to its actors to soak themselves into the ranges of risks and obsessions seen on screen. Make no mistake. Oppenheimer is the best lead performance of Cillian Murphy’s underappreciated career and the most solid work we’ve seen Robert Downey Jr. offer outside of the MCU in decades. Both are fractured men with different slants of stoicism and watching the two either embrace or combat the pressures on their characters is fascinating. Murphy and Downey have deservedly entered the early awards conversation and could be joined by the little infusions of heart that come from Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, and David Krumholtz from this stacked cast. To put it all together, Nolan and his Tenet editor Jennifer Lame then channel a little bit of Terrence Malick with a menagerie of hyper-edited insert shots of raw nature or character flashbacks that likely pace the film at the same furious 3.1 average shot length clip as his career average, one that is dubiously only a tenth of a second slower than maligned mayhem of Michael Bay. Chew on that math, cinephiles and FilmBros. More often than not, the frenetic flickering backed by a booming sound design and the blaring score of Black Panther Academy Award winner Ludwig Göransson makes Oppenheimer feel like maddening noise (commonly drowning out dialogue like in Tenet) more than an intoxicating symphony of high suspense, fascinating nuance, lofty consequences, and warranted comeuppance. Don’t get me wrong. Risks are wonderful. Film audiences crave them and piss and moan when they’re absent. It’s because risks and stakes engage the emotional responses and escapist feelings that come with these big screen storytelling vacations. From nicknamed childhood sleds to a Polaroid picture clue to a crime and millions of little things in-between, great movies can take minute details, events, and settings and amplify them to matter to an audience and evoke invested feelings. That’s where Oppenheimer overshoots. The amount of included risks within the movie centering around a crucial turning point in world history should be infinitely compelling, especially when crafted with off-the-scale production efforts. Somewhere, outside of small flickers, a fiery human heart is absent from all the artificial explosives. Rattle us. Scare us. Inspire us. Instead, it’s awfully hard to get hot-and-bothered about the bottom of Oppenheimer’s rabbit hole relying on a boardroom inquiry to renew someone’s security clearance and a congressional hearing to approve a Cabinet position appointment. After three hours and one of Nolan’s signature final-five-minute bow-tying crests, that’s it. Call those two central arcs and settings a boiled-down oversimplification of Nolan’s epic all you want, but that’s precisely where the touted risks of this endeavor have to matter and escalate to something bolder. Look at Oliver Stone’s JFK for an impact comparison and the use of its cinematic bells and whistles. A viewer should leave Oppenheimer convinced of depicted truths and dying to know more, not merely nodding “Well, that was that” like they watched a theatrical Wikipedia page summary. Even with all of its impressive pomp and noise, nothing dramatically radioactive is going to ping your internal Geiger counter higher than a nominal level. And that, like Dunkirk and Tenet before this, is another missed opportunity from one of the best filmmakers in the industry. There’s a pair of lines offered to our main character in Oppenheimer that mirror some of the pushback analysis to Nolan’s good standing. They read, “Don’t alienate the only people in the world who understand what you do. You may need them.” The Brit has his hardcore devotees, but he might be losing more of the rest with each exhausting effort.

First the good. The film is a talkie dressed up as a thriller with its pulse pounding score and wonderful cinematography by trusted collaborators Ludwig Göransson and Hoyte van Hoytema. The cast is to die for with star turns by Robert Downey Jr playing Lewis Strauss, the embittered head of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) trying to ruin Oppenheimer’s reputation and Emily Blunt as his long suffering wife, Kitty, whose fierce support of him acts as a counterpoint to his cool passivity during the AEC’s security hearings of 1954. Above all, Cillian Murphy gives a Masterclass portrayal of Oppenheimer as a man sure of his destiny, a scientific genius, but increasingly beset by doubts and guilt, whilst negotiating his survival in the anti-Communist security hearings. All three main leads will get Oscar nominated, of that you can be sure. Now for the bad. Despite critical acclaim and a Metacritic score of 90, there is a major weakness in the film which ultimately dilutes its power. Oppenheimer is a bio-pic, a dense character study of the American Prometheus, the man who was responsible for the atomic bomb and the ushering in of the modern, nuclear age. Yet, the Trinity test, is underwhelming, a damp squib with Hiroshima and Nagasaki reduced to a footnote. The heart of the film should have been a nuclear explosion that shocked and awed the audience in all its terrible, violent beauty and glory. Something that had not been seen or heard or experienced before in the cinema with its modern projection and sound systems. A talking point for audiences everywhere around the globe.  Naysayers will countenance that the atomic bomb was not the point of the film and the focus was on the man instead. Yet, Oppenheimer is nothing without his creation much like Frankenstein is nothing without his Monster. Without the bomb, nobody would be interested in seeing a film about a nuclear physicist. The two are inextricably linked and Nolan should have had the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima as the centrepiece of the film. Its horror and impact being indelibly etched on the minds of cinema goers and forcibly bringing home the significance of the man and his work. As a result of this omission, I think Nolan has dropped a googly. Plenty of plaudits have been given about how the Trinity test was a practical effect, rather than CGI, but Nolan’s decision to film it in silence with the resultant shock blast following moments later definitely weakens it’s power to astound and amaze. It would have been better to film the explosion, sight and sound, up close in all its glory, then cutaway back to the scientists and soldiers miles back. As a result, Oppenheimer could have been more impactful, but instead, it was somewhat underwhelming and disappointing. In the roll call of great Nolan films, I place Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk and Tenet all above it for their artistry, technical excellence and power to excite.

"Jul 21, 2023"," There’s a moment in Christopher Nolan’s historical epic “Oppenheimer” when a skeptical scientist asks the titular physicist (Cillian Murphy) why he should join him in constructing the atomic bomb. Before Oppenheimer can answer, Lieutenant General Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) cuts in, berating the scientist for even considering not being part of “the most important f****** thing to happen in the history of the world.” If you’ve followed the year-long promotional campaign for “Oppenheimer,” you might be under the impression that Nolan’s newest film is the cinematic equivalent of the Manhattan Project. Filmmaker Paul Schrader (“The Card Counter”) called it both the best and “most important film of the century.” AMC has already sold more than 40,000 tickets to double features of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” (an unlikely phenomenon dubbed “Barbenheimer“). The Coolidge Corner Theatre, which has been in business since 1929, has already sold more presale tickets for both films than any other movies in its history. The movie is an incredible achievement, and might be one of the most thorough, ambitious historical dramas ever put to film. Every single aspect of the movie is huge, from the cast to the real, non-CGI explosions Nolan created to mimic the Trinity Test. But “Oppenheimer” is also quiet and understated. Much of its three-hour runtime functions as a tense courtroom drama and a sprawling game of 1940s backroom politics. Most of all, it’s a fascinating character study of a man stuck living in a world of absolutes whose mind never seemed to be satisfactorily made up about anything. “Oppenheimer” tells two stories simultaneously, following both Oppenheimer’s rise to world renown as father of the atomic bomb as well as his downfall at the hands of Red Scare politicians and jealous colleagues. Early on, we see Oppenheimer teach his first lecture at UC-Berkeley, where he asks his lone student whether light exists as a ray or a particle. The correct answer is both, the professor says, and accepting these two seemingly contradictory statements simultaneously is integral to unlocking the field of quantum physics.  It’s a thesis statement for the troubled but brilliant man, and Nolan shows us over and over the difficulty of living life as a man of two minds. After a professor upbraids young Oppenheimer in front of the whole class, he poisons the man’s apple — only to rush back later and surreptitiously remove it. He attends a communist party meeting because he finds the theories interesting, but chides his brother for joining the party. He carries on multiple affairs, and even leaves Los Alamos at a crucial point in the atom bomb’s development to visit his distraught mistress (Florence Pugh) because, as he is later forced to testify, “she needed me.” As Oppenheimer, Murphy is almost never out of frame. He’s so central to the film that Nolan took the rare step of writing the entire script in the first person from Oppenheimer’s perspective. He is supremely confident from the start, but his eyes slowly begin to dim as the weight of his actions seep into his subconscious. When the Trinity Test is finally complete, he removes his protective eyewear to allow the full magnitude of his actions to wash over him, in a scene reminiscent of Murphy’s 2007 solar-centric sci-fi masterpiece “Sunshine.” Even before the accolades begin rolling in, Oppenheimer begins to question (but never definitively answer) whether the bomb was needed at all. The post-WWII propaganda claim, still repeated today, that the bomb “saved lives,” is held up for scrutiny, and Oppenheimer’s opposition to construction of the hydrogen bomb makes enemies of formerly close colleagues. All of this leads to the powers-that-be slowly pushing Oppenheimer out of the picture by dredging up his communist dalliances and airing his extramarital affairs as evidence of impaired judgment. Despite Murphy’s omnipresence, there’s plenty of room for the supporting cast to shine. Nolan doesn’t cut corners the way that a standard biopic might, refusing to create composite characters or mess with the timeline of history to serve the film. As a result, you’ll be spotting literally dozens of performers you know popping in and out of frame, even if only for a line or two. Oscar winning actors like Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and Casey Affleck each have barely more than a scene to their name, but make their impact deeply felt with limited screen time.  The prime supporting players are outstanding as well. Damon is the most consistent comic relief, playing a gruff but loyal general overseeing Oppenheimer’s work. As a longtime Oppenheimer colleague turned adversary, Robert Downey Jr. has finally found a post-Marvel role that allows him to showcase his considerable talents. Jason Clarke (“Chappaquiddick”) is delightfully detestable as one of the film’s only out-and-out villains. Even the two female roles, typically a Nolan blind spot, have slightly more depth than usual. Playing Oppenheimer’s wife, Emily Blunt seems stuck in an alcohol-induced malaise, but snaps to life in the film’s final act, lashing out at the men who dare try to tear her husband down. In his quest for telling the most epic, authoritative, historically accurate version of Oppenheimer’s life, Nolan has succeeded. This dedication means that a few scenes and characters probably could have been left on the cutting room floor, especially after the bomb at Los Alamos is detonated. The closest analogue might be Oliver Stone’s presidential drama “JFK,” which combines masterful filmmaking, Cold War paranoia, and a three-plus hour runtime. “Oppenheimer” has none of the propulsive action or mind-bending sci-fi that the director is known for. But at a moment in time when the world’s atomic scientists say that the planet is closer to nuclear catastrophe than we’ve been since Hiroshima and Nagasaki, “Oppenheimer” quietly, persistently asks us to pay attention, lest we fail to learn from history’s mistakes.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," The most chilling scene in Christopher Nolan‘s immense and haunting new three-hour drama, Oppenheimer, is the one where a group of men finalizes plans to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. By now, we’ve all heard the defenses of this abhorrent decision: how it ended the war; how it was the only way to get through to the Japanese; how, by the math of projected casualties, it may actually have saved lives. Yet we’ve never heard the decision rationalized so calmly by those making it, as though it were a matter of mere accounting, debated with hands un-wringed and brows unfurrowed. Eventually, one of the men casually rejects Kyoto as a potential target, sparing its thousands of civilians — and dooming thousands more — because the city held “cultural meaning to the Japanese.” Also, he once honeymooned there.  More than just the cold calculus of it all, what makes the conversation so disturbing is how it’s staged. These men, these destroyers of worlds, convene not in some ceremonial war room but in a small, cramped office, politely exchanging words from their perches on couches and chairs. And Nolan doesn’t particularly emphasize the significance of the scene. It arrives without fanfare or crescendo, not at the beginning or the end of the movie, not as a centerpiece, but as just another item on the timeline of events, the unbroken series of causes and effects the writer-director methodically traces. Oppenheimer, an epic of creation, destruction, hubris, and lots of heady talk, proceeds with the relentless logic of a chain reaction. If you wanted to be cute, you could say it moves in particles and waves, as a fluid flood of atomized history, each scene flowing unstoppably into the next. Though the film marks Nolan’s first foray into the generally unremarkable field of biographical drama, it’s every bit as propulsive as his superhero and science-fiction movies. This time, there’s a particular moral dimension to the momentum: In its forever-churning montage, Oppenheimer evokes the unstoppable forward rush of scientific advance. That the film scarcely pauses for breath is an expression of its subject’s dedicated pursuit of how, unhindered by questions of if until it’s much too late. The script covers a significant stretch of milestones in the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), from his 1920s youth as a promising, rebellious university student —his vindictive near-poisoning of a professor is an ominous early hint of how his brilliance can and will be weaponized — to his 1960s award-ceremony dotage as the revered Father of the Atomic Bomb. The bulk of the drama happens in between, on a helix of linked dilemmas: the race against the Nazis to develop the bomb and the way Oppenheimer’s almost casual interest in socialist politics threatened his influence. Nolan, famed tinkerer of time, naturally offers a less than linear path through this dense 20th-century dossier. He has structured Oppenheimer like an Aaron Sorkin courtroom drama, only way knottier, weaving around two separate hearings — one a closed-door inquisition shot in full color, another a very public deposition shot in rich black-and-white. The film, as chronologically sophisticated as The Prestige, weaves in and out of these different chapters in Oppenheimer’s career; only those who have read the source material, the biography American Prometheus, might correctly ballpark the year at every juncture. At one point, Nolan takes us inside a flashback within a flashback within a testimony. Eventually, he brings the parallel timelines together. There are elements familiar to the Great Man biopic. Nolan illustrates Oppenheimer’s blooming inspiration as flashes of chemical process — a more visually pleasing version of the disembodied grids of digits A Beautiful Mind deployed to the same end. The film also drifts periodically into Oppenheimer’s personal life, specifically the love triangle he forged with his wife, biologist Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Though it inspires the first sex scenes of Nolan’s filmography, including one that eccentrically repurposes the man’s famous quoting of Hindu scripture as foreplay, this material won’t dissuade those who insist that the filmmaker brings a chilly touch to matters of the human heart.  Certainly, he seems more engaged with the logistics of the Manhattan Project, which is depicted in Oppenheimer as a marshaling of conflicting personalities and grievances and skillsets. Can Nolan relate? At times, the Los Alamos Laboratory, constructed in the New Mexico desert, resembles nothing so much as a giant film set. Oppenheimer, director of a different sort, flits from department to department, city to city, circumventing jurisdictions, matching his team of big brains and bigger egos to different tasks. Nolan has, of course, assembled his own dream team, and a rather staggering cast list of famous faces to fill out even the minor roles. They’re more particles forming the waves of this dark vision, this monument to an experiment in death. The nucleus of the movie is Murphy, in a performance of grand mystery and calculation. The actor is gaunt and iconic under a fedora. His sunken cheeks express the inward depression of Oppenheimer’s soul. His eyes blaze like the blue flames of an explosion, alternately conveying curiosity, ambition, and bottomless guilt. He is a mess of contradictions: dark but witty, thoughtful but arrogant, an introverted big thinker who becomes a rock star in magazines and at podiums, at once architect and mere instrument of human destiny. Nolan drinks all this in, through close-ups of sumptuous 65mm, shot on IMAX cameras. Not since The Master, perhaps, has a filmmaker used the large gauge to such intimate effect, making a vast canvas from one man’s troubled features. No screen may be big enough for Oppenheimer‘s centerpiece attraction, the climax of all that feverish research, the desert test that cleaved history in half. Nolan recreated the explosion for real, sans the nuclear material, and it’s an awe-inspiring practical effect: an inferno of blinding light and eerie silence, chased by the deafening roar of the world’s loudest starting gun. It’s also the only moment of traditional spectacle in a $100 million blockbuster of middle-aged men debating quantum physics in drab rooms. We never directly witness the horrific results of Oppenheimer’s achievement. There’s a queasy scene of moral revulsion, as the scientist addresses his team in the aftermath of victory, swallowing his growing unease, the frame literally quivering with the obscenity of the celebration. But Nolan does not take us to ground zero, to the before or after of the cities we leveled. It’s a strategic omission, an absence with purpose; leaving all that death and destruction unseen reflects the blinkered perspective of these men, making the theoretical actual while divorced from the consequences of their anti-human folly. The tragedy must happen offscreen. The last hour of Oppenheimer will likely prove divisive. Rather than dwell on his subject’s ballooning sense of responsibility, Nolan gradually pulls together the dangling threads of those two parallel hearings, redirecting his focus to Oppenheimer’s waning stature in D.C., the status of his security clearance during the Red Scare, and his complicated relationship with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., liberating himself from the snark, but not the arrogance, of Tony Stark). It’s complex, cleverly orchestrated political theater … which can’t help but seem insignificant compared to the matter of world-reshaping, world-collapsing power Oppenheimer unleashed. Who cares about Beltway infighting when there are mushroom clouds sprouting on the horizon? Maybe that’s part of the point Nolan is making, though. Oppenheimer’s feat of science was a realization of the inconceivable — an event of unprecedented enormity, by all definitions of the word. Yet a decade later, it had already been rolled into the standard business and grudges of politics. Oppenheimer changed the world forever, but he couldn’t change Washington. And in the end, his terrible invention fell into the hands of people too indifferent to its power. In the opus of Oppenheimer, Nolan finds a dark vision of history as men gathered in small rooms, trifling with forces beyond their existential pay grade. This has been a fantastic year in film, especially for dramas. Superhero films have dominated the box office for nearly 20 years. Yet, a historical drama, Oppenheimer, grossed more at the worldwide box office than the year's highest-grossing comic book movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. If you told someone that during The Avengers era, they wouldn't believe you. There ended up being a fair number of unique, pulse-pounding thrillers released this year. While not all of 2023’s best nail-biters were released in the same fashion or welcomed quite as well as others, either, each managed to offer completely different experiences to those who pressed play or took the time out to see them in the theater. Now, with the year in the midst of winding down, it’s worth looking back at some of 2023’s greatest cinematic offerings and honoring the ones that have made the biggest lasting impressions. In Celine Song's Past Lives, there is a scene where Nora (The Morning Show's Greta Lee) is speaking to her future husband Arthur (John Magaro) about the concept of inyeon. Nora explains that inyeon means ""providence or fate,"" and it's ""specifically about relationships between people."" Inyeon is about the people who come into your life. It can be something as small as two strangers bumping into each other in the street. Inyeon can also be about the person you marry and that there were thousands of layers across thousands of lifetimes that led you to that moment. In other words, you met this person in a past life.

"Jul 21, 2023"," Recently, it’s felt like Christopher Nolan is at odds with his viewer. There’s a strange antagonism to his storytelling in his past couple of films, less of an invitation into a world than the posing of a challenge — dukes up, narratively. In 2020’s “Tenet,” and now in “Oppenheimer,” his obfuscation of story can be trying to watch, as we trot behind the auteur, hoping that the complex cinematic bombast will pay off, that it’s not just obfuscation for obfuscation’s sake. Unmoored in time, space and subjectivity, these films can be a struggle. Take heed of the advice of the scientist played by Clémence Poésy in “Tenet,” and “don’t try to understand it — feel it,” as she tells John David Washington’s Protagonist. The only choice Nolan allows is total submission to his dominance — to stop fighting and allow yourself to be sucked under the visual and sonic riptide that is “Oppenheimer.” Whether that results in an enjoyable viewing experience will depend on the individual audience member. Nolan brings a jagged, dissonant sensibility to his adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s “American Prometheus,” the biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer (played here by Cillian Murphy), the physicist known as the “father of the atomic bomb.” The film opens with a quote about Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and gave it to man, and for this was chained to a rock and tortured for the rest of his existence. Nolan imagines Oppenheimer’s torture as a parade of endless bureaucracy: government surveillance, closed-door tribunals, Senate hearings, and of course, award ceremonies and medals for what he has done. This is not a movie about a bomb, but rather a movie about the U.S. government’s relationship to what it did in bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, subsuming the moral stance under piles of paperwork. The film is largely concerned with Adm. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the head of the Atomic Energy Commission, who both worked and clashed with Oppenheimer after the war. The first and third hours of the three-hour “Oppenheimer” are dedicated almost solely to the machinations of Strauss’ Senate confirmation hearing in 1959 and the 1954 security hearing he convened to subject Oppenheimer to tortuous questioning about his private life and Communist leanings. These two events, five years apart (though not indicated as such), are conflated in the film. Nolan discards the dates and details of traditional biopic storytelling, which is a frustrating if evocative choice. He thrusts us headlong and simultaneously into the advent and fallout of the nuclear arms race with the same nagging insistence that Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) adopts to recruit Oppenheimer to the Manhattan Project. The film also switches frequently between black and white and color, and Nolan has said in interviews that the choice reflects a difference between the objective (black and white) and subjective (color) point of view, but a viewer without knowledge of this could not discern that from the internal logic of the film itself. The color swaps sometimes happen mid-scene. These choices all seem like a strategy to keep us adrift in a shower of science and politics, and therefore, “Oppenheimer” is less about facts and more about feeling. All we have as an anchor are Murphy’s piercing blue eyes, and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema gets his camera up close to capture his nuclear-sized guilt. Oppenheimer is haunted, from the beginning — when he attempts to poison his bully of a physics tutor with a cyanide-laced apple — to the end. In both the edit, by Jennifer Lame, and the score, by Ludwig Göransson, there is a relentless, agitated pace, skillfully achieved. The edit is especially complex, slamming from scene to scene with little context. The score roars and riles and cajoles; it instructs you to look, pay attention, now. We think we are racing toward the bomb, but the bomb comes and goes. Oppenheimer’s torment is forever. There’s a dissonance between the rapid-fire dense dialogue and the cinematic effect, which jostles and hurries us along. The only moments when the film is fully present, the form and content aligned, are when Oppenheimer finds himself in a dissociative panic attack, whether eyeing the poisoned apple or lurching through a rah-rah rallying speech post-Hiroshima. The sound drops out, the camera finds his mottled blue eyes, the roar of feet on wooden bleachers explodes back in with a boom. The edges of the image wobble precariously. When the smoke clears, it’s just Oppenheimer and his haunted blue eyes and the sound of a bomb. If one can keep afloat in Nolan’s swiftly running cinematic current, these moments are worth it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," Clout-chasing can be a shared passion among young people, which is part of why it is so common to see it in horror films. The medical students of Flatliners push themselves to see how long they can be medically dead, while the videographers of The Blair Witch Project want the glory of unlocking an urban legend. The characters in Talk to Me, the new Australian horror film from first-time directors Danny and Michael Philippou, may not have grandiose pursuits, and yet they are driven by a similar desire to impress. The film follows a group of teenagers who egg each other on in a sick, creepy game where they communicate with the afterlife. Their game doesn’t go well, and before long, the film finds inventive, creepy ways to torment its hapless protagonists. There is a Gen Z sheen to what happens here, a clever way to obscure an old-fashioned celebration of what has always been scary. The game in question involves an embalmed hand, covered in porcelain or plaster, and permanently stuck in a handshake position. In order to play the game, someone must hold the hand and say, “Talk to me.” This leads to communion with the dead: The person who says the phrase immediately sees a rotting corpse—Talk to Me’s manifestation of a spirit in the afterlife. By adding “I let you in,” they are temporarily possessed. Rather than play the game privately, like how you might say “candyman” in a darkened bathroom mirror, this is a communal effort: Onlookers watch and wait for their turn, often by recording everything on TikTok. The directors, twin brothers with a YouTube following, add an interesting quirk to the game, one that leads to clever editing. Only the person who says “talk to me” can see the spirit, so part of the fun is that only the possessed person can see the spirit before it enters them, leaving the onlookers to marvel at how their friend’s demeanor completely changes. The hosts of this roving party are the “bad kids” of the neighborhood, so in an effort to learn more or maybe fit in, a group of naive teenagers host the game in their home. Jade (Alexandra Jensen) refuses to play, while her best friend Mia (Sophie Wilde) cannot wait to try. At first, everyone decides Jade’s brother Riley (Joe Bird) is too young to play, but the temptation and clout-chasing impulse is too great. When Riley lets someone in, his possession ends in disaster: Riley slams his head against a wall, a desk, whatever surface he can find, before he passes out from shock. Beaten and bloody, Riley convalesces in the hospital, but whenever he wakes up, he methodically performs whatever self-harm he can. Mia believes learning the secret behind the embalmed hand is the only way she can stop the cycle, leading her down some truly dark paths. No one expects the sharpest writing from a film like this, but the script—co-written by Danny Philippou and Bill Hinzman—creates credible characters and situations. Mia has an impulsive streak, but she is also protective of Riley, who she sees as a surrogate younger brother. She also has her own demons. We learn through flashback that Mia’s mother died by suicide, which creates a deeper purpose for her participation in the game. If it is so easy for others to communicate with the dead, maybe her mother is lurking around somewhere. Supporting characters add credibility simply by speaking in a no-nonsense way. Miranda Otto plays Sue, Jade and Riley’s mother, and she cuts through her children’s bullshit faster than they can conjure another white lie. Of course, none of these characters have the full story about what is happening to them, so Talk to Me turns the screws through horror sequences that mix gore, psychological thriller, and coming-of-age anxiety. Although not the goriest scene, there was one moment during my screening where several people walked out of the film. It involves a sleepover between Mia and Daniel (Otis Dhanji), a neighbor on whom she has a crush. Talk to Me suggests that ghosts are free to possess whoever they want whenever they want, and, while Mia and Daniel are sleeping, a possessed Mia does … well, I should not say more. But I will add that the Philippous know horror and disgust often go hand in hand. Even during transgressive moments, the film is never excessive for its own sake, so when characters recoil, there is additional subtext that makes the performances plausible, or at least interesting. Explanations are never really the point for this kind of horror film, so Talk to Me falters slightly as it draws to a close, looking for an elegant situation. That is more a feature than a bug—hasty third acts are typical of the genre, and we shouldn’t hold that against the filmmakers. And in doing so, the Philippous create a dark, disquieting situational irony that is equal parts creepy and karmically unjust. In the immediate moment of watching, this is the sort of film where you’re too scared or curious to think about whether what you’re seeing makes any sense. In that way, we are kind of like Mia and the others, although most of us have seen enough movies to know this kind of party game is always a mistake. Then again, a demonic spirit is no match for the intensity of peer pressure—especially when everyone has a phone pointed at you. We don't have one. Readers like you keep our work free for everyone to read. If you think that it's important to have high quality local reporting we hope you'll support our work with a monthly contribution.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," As the so-called ""father of the atomic bomb"", American theoretical physicist J Robert Oppenheimer was also, in a sense, the granddaddy of modern spectacle, setting off a big bang whose blast radius spread out across the entirety of modern culture. Few images were more terrifying – or more awesome – than the mushroom cloud generated by a nuclear explosion, an image seared into the visual language of politics, media and entertainment of the late 20th century and beyond. Even his famously cheerful quote – ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds"" – has come to sound less like a lift from the Bhagavad Gita than a quip from a movie supervillain presiding over some de rigueur apocalypse. It's fitting, then, that this seismic story (based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin) should be brought to the screen by Christopher Nolan, that reigning brainiac of the blockbuster whose gift for engineering spectacle has made him one of the key architects of the new millennium's multiplex. In this age of cookie-cutter IP, the British filmmaker is one of the few remaining auteurs capable of commanding a studio budget to mount an original project of scale and ambition, and to his credit he's used that clout to deliver what is essentially a three-hour movie comprised of men talking in close-ups (call it the fedora-friendly Women Talking), albeit staged in towering 70mm IMAX that renders its subjects as starched-collar colossuses. In taking on the moral complexity of a brilliant, hubristic visionary, it also feels like Nolan is reckoning with his own place in the history of 21st-century cinema, as a destroyer of cinematic worlds, whose blockbuster Batman films played a significant part in reshaping the contemporary movie landscape. Nolan regular Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins; Inception), his otherworldly blue eyes and pout looming almost comically large, plays Oppenheimer, who we first meet at the centre of the US government's 1954 security hearing led by Lewis Strauss, the atomic energy commissioner with a political and personal axe to grind (he's played by a slippery Robert Downey Jr., reminding us of the great actor he was before entering a decade-plus purgatory of glib Marvel mugging). Couched in grainy, newsreel black-and-white, it's all stuffy courtrooms and stiff suits, McCarthyism and Red Scare in full flight, as the investigating committee tries to lay blame for an information leak in the Manhattan Project on Oppenheimer and his suspected communist sympathies. At the same time, the movie enters a series of nested, structurally ambitious flashbacks, to Oppenheimer's first meeting with Strauss – and what will become a pivotal encounter with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) – and to his early career in the 20s and 30s, as he transforms from an anxious Cambridge student with a headful of T.S. Eliot and Picasso to an assured Berkeley academic whose idealistic curiosity draws him into the orbit of left-wing radicals. From these circles come Oppenheimer's great romances. There's Jean Tatlock (a fleeting but fiery Florence Pugh), a young physician with whom he enters a prolonged, sporadic affair, and Katherine 'Kitty' Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt, mostly relegated to performing 'alcoholic wife'), a jaded former radical who he would go on to marry. Nolan's dabbling in romance, never one of his strong suits, alternately yields some of the film's clumsiest and prettiest images. An intimate scene where Oppenheimer reads his soon-to-be-infamous quote from the Sanskrit text – which Jean holds just below her naked breasts – is as charmingly awkward in its sex-and-death fusion as it is brazen for daring to exist in this age of the chaste blockbuster. Scenes of Oppenheimer and Kitty swooning against the Santa Fe ranch sky – with the former looking like a gaunt cowboy detective – have the spooky sweep of cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's work on Jordan Peele's fantastic Nope, another film with a view to unpacking cinema's fraught spectacle. One of Nolan's great strokes is to splice Oppenheimer's thoughts, and Murphy's glassy, galactic stare, into cosmic montages of swirling molecules, particles and dying stars (a fittingly Kuleshovian move), impressionistic images that have the effect of a Stan Brakhage film projected onto a planetarium dome. (It's hard to imagine Nolan didn't take a cue from the atomic sequence in David Lynch's Twin Peaks: The Return, a dizzying macro zoom into a mushroom cloud that remains one of the greatest sequences ever put to screen.) Nolan and editor Jennifer Lame (Tenet) build this montage to show-stopping effect in the film's centrepiece, as Oppenheimer and his team, under the supervision of gung-ho Colonel Leslie Groves (a reliably buoyant Matt Damon), race to build and test an atomic bomb at a secret site in the Los Alamos desert. It's a typically bravura sequence, full of stark images of men slathered in sunscreen and wearing fly-eye goggles, but it's even more remarkable for what it withholds; just as the blast hits, Nolan lets his stentorian sound mix fall away, leaving us in the stark company of human breathing. True to the director's form, Oppenheimer plays more or less like a three-hour trailer, with endlessly clipped scenes and thunderous, wall-to-wall music from composer Ludwig Göransson that goes from elegantly weird to overbearing, especially as it thrums beneath scenes of otherwise subdued dialogue. It's all tease with little payoff, befitting a tapestry of frustrated men squabbling over weapons of mass destruction. Yet all of this works to enhance Oppenheimer's strange effect, not to diminish it, and by the film's final moments it has, often by sheer force rather than any kind of elegance, cemented itself as an enormous, ugly-beautiful object infused with as much melancholy as bombast. ""You're the American Prometheus, the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves,"" Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) tells Oppenheimer. In examining that power through the spectacle it indirectly inspired, Nolan's film opens up a fascinating conversation with both the destruction of the past and the cinema of the present. Go see it.

"Jul 21, 2023"," As counterintuitive as this may sound, the emotions felt by “the destroyer of worlds” over his invention simply aren’t all that interesting. Much more fascinating and better prone to dramatisation — especially in the hands of a filmmaker with more affinity for concepts and theory over human emotion — is the journey that led him there. In those sections of the film more directly concerned with the facts of Oppenheimer’s life, Nolan holds on to the very sincere, cheesy idea that no one but Oppenheimer could have done this — that this man was fated to invent the nuclear bomb. But the intrigue is thorny enough to forgive those more childish ideas, at least for a while. How did this scientist, dreamy (in both senses of the term, with Cillian Murphy in the part) and more concerned with concepts than with their practical implications, end up building a weapon?  In its first few sequences, the film rattles through the events that led the young professor to become part of the Manhattan project with a swiftness and a reliance on cliched imagery that, in its best moments, give the impression of watching a trailer for the film Oppenheimer. In its worst, it brings to mind Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, that timeless satire of biopic stereotypes that should have forever changed the model for such films. It seems that in every room the young Oppenheimer enters, he meets a world-famous scientist who tells him which university he should go to next. Those early expository sequences are dense with detailed biographical information that feel superfluous, or which in any case could have been introduced in a more time-effective and subtle manner. Nolan himself seems to recognise this, however, for he juxtaposes the linear biography with two other important moments from Oppenheimer’s life: his security-clearance hearing in 1954, where he is questioned over his past associations with communists; and the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (an excellent Robert Downey Jr.), a former senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, where Strauss is queried about his past support of Oppenheimer.  These two parallel storylines (trust Nolan never to stick to a linear narrative) put an emphasis on the alliances and rivalries that formed during Oppenheimer’s involvement in the Manhattan project, and over his entire life. The gallery of recognisable faces (Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, Casey Affleck, David Dastmalchian to name just a few) in those scenes sometimes threatens to distract from the dialogue which, though perfectly audible (it famously was not so in Tenet), is so incredibly dense that it feels as though Nolan intentionally sought to express straightforward ideas in the most convoluted way possible — an attempt at getting away from Walk Hard territory, perhaps? In any case, working out the system of interlocked alliances and secret rivalries that shaped Oppenheimer’s fate is the most entertaining of Nolan’s puzzles here.  One of the major themes the director underlines in the life of his subject is Oppenheimer’s love for theories, and his naive belief that they can and should be considered separately from their potential real-life implications. History would prove deeply ironic for Oppenheimer, but beyond his story, it seems as though Nolan wants to warn of the danger in living only in one’s head, in the abstract world of thought alone. Perhaps this is why the filmmaker, often accused of embracing precisely such a disembodied perspective in his work, is so concerned here with representing not just the ideas of his protagonist, but also his sex life and his emotions, as obvious as they might be — all the sound and the fury of being alive. As mentioned above, most of this does not work (particularly the bizarre sex scene), but Murphy’s embodied performance and striking features help keep the film’s feet more or less firmly on the ground, in the lived-in world.  Much more moving and effective is the film’s consideration of the place of Oppenheimer’s Jewishness in his story: the bomb he built to fight the Nazis ended up being used to kill thousands of Japanese civilians, at a time when the war was, according to most, already won. The scene in which state officials decide on which two cities to bomb — the first to show that they have the ability to do so, the second to demonstrate that they can do it again — is where Nolan’s blunt, naive style works best. No dreamlike, subjective sequence is necessary to make us feel Oppenheimer’s profound ambivalence here. It’s possible there was no need for any such declamatory scenes at all.  The images used on this website have been provided by journalists and are believed to be free of rights.

"Jul 21, 2023"," With Chat GPT and A.I. having been unceremoniously launched upon us with little regard for how this technology could impact education, job security, the spread of misinformation, plagiarism, the protection of and value of creative works, and human communication, society is yet again facing a quandary that has accompanied many advances in technology: the awareness that just because we can do something, doesn’t mean we should. As these discussions around how scientific advancement needs to be accompanied by social, cultural and ethical considerations to protect humanity again surge, along comes Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, the story of a man who helped research and create the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II – and considered the ethical implications of his work only after it had been unleashed. I’m sure Nolan appreciates how these questions of ethics and science are cyclical, coming back around again and again. The American has always been preoccupied with the personal and the vast, putting individual desires and ambitions in relation to the vastness of the world and cosmos, naturally making room for circular imagery that captures planets, galaxies, cycles of time, the interconnected flow of life. Oppenheimer is no different, beginning with ripples of water, constantly referring back to images of marbles and molecules, and leading, of course, to images of the Earth lit up with blooming nuclear explosions. Against this circularity is the almost jarring angularity of Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer, introduced to us first as a young student, rake-thin with jutting cheekbones and an intellect like a knife: sharp, penetrating and potentially lethal. An early scene shows us Oppenheimer poisoning an apple belonging to a professor he dislikes: a true story illustrating how he can take something soft, round, natural, of the Earth, and infuse it with something terrible. The apple story is based on real events, and the film is adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The biography is a 600-plus page tome and Nolan doesn’t shy away from getting into the gritty details. Exploring Oppenheimer’s scientific career and meetings with figures like Nihls Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) at Oxford; his Communist sympathies and activism at Berkely which resulted in disapproval from colleagues such as Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett); the origin and development of the Manhattan Project under the guidance of General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon); a complex relationship with recruiter Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.); a character assassination disguised as a 1954 security hearing interrogation; D.C. political machinations and Senate hearings; and some of Oppenheimer’s womanising, Nolan packs his film full of historical information, ideological discussions and some basic physics, almost demanding a second watch to get all the events and key characters straight. With several timelines (one shot in black and white), impressionistic imagery of waves and particles, camerawork that pans and tracks, a score that constantly soars and swells, Nolan is playing with perpetual motion maximalism. It’s a testament to the sharp writing and editing that it remains vaguely cohesive and utterly engaging for its three hour runtime, though the relentless pace can leave the emotional impact and resonance of all the action without room to breathe – at least on first viewing. The performances are stellar across the board, with each actor grounding us with their characters and showing us the differing motivations and forces at play. Damon’s General Groves is gruff and no-nonsense, recognising Oppenheimer’s brilliance but never being intimidated by it. Downey Jr’s Strauss, on the other hand, appears wily and unctuous, desperate to be close to power. It’s a nuanced performance from Downey Jr, hopefully marking a new career chapter of sophisticated character work in the wake of his Marvel tenure. But this is Cillian Murphy’s film and his performance is sublimely layered. Oppenheimer was opaque in his complexity: brilliant, egotistical, idealistic, arrogant, womanising, selfish, and also vulnerable to the pressures of his mind, the impact of his work and later, the Washington politics that sought to destroy him. Murphy brings a charismatic chilliness to the character during his early life and career, which makes his sense of defeat during the humiliating 1954 security hearing feel more jarring – he seems to shrink physically and spiritually as his desire to be a good patriot and world citizen is battered under McCarthy-esque accusations. Nolan keeps one thread of the film subjective, staying intimately close to Murphy and letting us into his occasionally wobbling psyche. At times, this subjective viewpoint does the subject matter a disservice. The much-anticipated big bang of the test bomb in Los Alamos, Mexico proves disappointing, with Nolan’s silent, impressionistic gaze failing to portray the sense of terror and awe necessary. More problematically, as Oppenheimer begins to grapple with devastation inflicted upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we only see the most artistic representations of his guilty conscience: the air goes woozy, the sound cuts out and there are gauzy visions of bodies turned to ash but Oppenheimer (and we the audience) are protected from ever seeing anything too distressing or distasteful. Oppenheimer may eventually tell Gary Oldman’s President Truman that, “I feel like I have blood on my hands” – but the blood is kept firmly off-camera, making Oppenheimer’s feelings, and not the actual violence, the focus. And unfortunately, Nolan’s recurring problem with writing well-rounded female characters returns in full force, as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) are both reduced to mercurial hysterics and in Pugh’s case, completely gratuitous nudity. A late scene that shows Kitty’s razor-sharp intellect and fierce aplomb – with dialogue lifted straight from the real security hearing transcripts – acts as a hollow ‘Gotcha!’ moment; we’re supposed to be triumphantly surprised by Kitty’s composure, which we wouldn’t be if Nolan hadn’t crafted her as a one-note alcoholic mess for the previous two hours and forty five minutes. At various points in the film, Oppenheimer is accused of being many things: a Communist, a politician, a womaniser, a martyr, a cry-baby, a traitor, a patriot. Nolan’s portrayal is sympathetic, placing the man into the wider context, showing how the divisive politics and self-serving motivations of those around him took his work and used it to devastating degrees, but it still highlights how Oppenheimer was a man who was too consumed by theory to recognise the real impact of his work until it was too late. Hopefully this engaging, brilliantly made, flawed and fully immersive film reminds us all of such dangers.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," You feel them going off even in seemingly minor moments. For instance: Early in the film, when a young J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy, giving a career performance) observes a Picasso painting. The scene is barely even a scene; it's more of a montage fragment. But as this wunderkind takes in this masterpiece, you glean the primary point Nolan wants to make about his subject: That Oppenheimer’s perception of the world was inherently Cubist. Which is to say that Oppenheimer was simultaneously able to see a subject’s many different angles—and this ability allowed him to justify his sometimes dubious, ultimately world-shaking actions.  If the painting, though, is an early window into Oppenheimer’s kaleidoscopic mind, it’s also an approximation of the film’s nonlinear structure. Nolan never met a clock he didn’t think would benefit from multiple dials, and Oppenheimer certainly employs some of Cubism’s disjointedness as it jumps across timelines. Nolan distinguishes different periods through the use of color (the bulk of the narrative) and black-and-white (Oppenheimer antagonist Lewis Strauss’s 1959 cabinet confirmation hearing).  For the most part, all the time-jumping doesn’t inspire confusion, and rather contributes to the film’s athletic pacing. Oppenheimer’s third act revolves around a pair of hearings: one, in 1954, over whether to renew Oppenheimer’s security clearance; and the other, over Strauss’s (Robert Downey Jr., your 2024 Best Supporting Actor) confirmation. Nolan sprinkles the various depositions earlier in the film as narration. We hear different characters describe why Oppenheimer was eventually chosen to run the Manhattan Project (his unparalleled genius at theoretical physics) despite being a risky choice for the position (his womanizing, plus his flirtations with communism).  Along the way, Nolan’s technique brought to mind another early 20th century master of modern art: Jackson Pollock. Oppenheimer is immense, assaultive, and full of eye-enveloping abstraction. It’s these qualities that allow the director to pull off an exceedingly difficult task: Making complex theory cinematic. Nolan doesn’t spend much time on the nitty-gritty of fusion and fission, and instead conjures these ideas’ sublimity with quick cuts to dazzling depictions of particles, stars, and light. It’s during these moments when Göransson’s score is loudest, thrumming with the at once frightening and exciting momentum of world-shaking ideas.  For all its experimental flourishes, though, if you rearranged Oppenheimer in a chronological order, you’d be left with a fairly traditional biopic. The film’s underlying conventionality is most glaring in its use of lofty dialogue to characterize—and mythologize—its complicated hero. Characters constantly tell Oppenheimer things like, “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important” and “Robert, you see beyond the world we live in. Of course we’ll help you.” My favorite, though, is: “How could the man who saw so much be so blind?” Overall, Oppenheimer is a sympathetic, though not altogether uncritical, portrait. Nolan, who has called Oppenheimer “the most important person who ever lived,” is clearly enamored by his subject’s mind, charisma, and appearance. In his baggy, high-waisted pants and soft-brimmed hat, Murphy cuts a striking figure. Though, it’s not just him. Like all Nolan movies, Oppenheimer is consumed with a classical handsomeness. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s elegant compositions lend a warranted import to these events. But while visually stunning, the film’s serious aesthetic has one downside: It counteracts the inherent camp of Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock (an early love), making Oppenheimer quote the Bhagavad-Gita during sex.  The passage she opens to is, “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” The passage reverberates in Oppenheimer’s mind during the Trinity Test. That explosion, Oppenheimer suggests, is the crowning achievement of Oppenheimer’s life’s work. It’s also the zenith of this film. Nolan orchestrates it like a world-class conductor, producing an orgasmic symphony of awe, wonder, and catastrophic power. It’s terrifying, but also irresistible. As such, it brings you closer to understanding Oppenheimer: Who doesn’t want to play God for a moment?",POSITIVE

As West Side Story composer Leonard Bernstein, Bradley Cooper captures his incandescent musical gift, joie de vivre, reckless prankishness, inwardness and performative ebullience, his bisexual seductiveness and utter selfishness. As his Broadway star wife, Felicia Montealegre, Carey Mulligan is even better. We feel her radiant intelligence and big heart, the spark between them and her exasperation when he courts handsome youths at their legendary posh parties. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) The Pulitzer Prize–winning 1982 novel by Alice Walker, 79, is strong medicine. The Color Purple Broadway musical version has been adapted for the screen, following the 1985 drama from Steven Spielberg, 77. The movie musical about Celie — an abused orphan in the Deep South suffering repeated abominations until she finally gets out from under and finds redemption — boasts an unbeatable cast: Fantasia Barrino as the put-upon heroine; a vibrant Taraji P. Henson, 53, as Shug Avery, the singer who escaped their hometown; and Rustin’s Colman Domingo, 54, as the meanest, orneriest, downright evil Mister. The costumes, vocal talent and energetic production numbers are first-rate. Yet the story’s pile-on of horrors — incest, rape, baby theft, physical abuse, soul-crushing incarceration — make for a discordant mix of the feel-good and the feel-worse. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ferrari is sleek, fast and dangerous. Adam Driver steers the thrilling biopic with a gripping, mature performance as graying Italian motor company owner Enzo Ferrari. The racer-turned-entrepreneur finds himself at a crossroads in 1957. His company is in crisis. Given that it takes a village to manufacture exquisite cars for consumers, as well as Formula 1 racers, the local economy weighs on his broad shoulders. His marriage to Laura (a searing Penélope Cruz) has withered under the pressure of his ambition and their only son’s death. His long-term mistress, Lina Lardi (a plummy Shailene Woodley), comforts Enzo, but Lina insists her lover acknowledge paternity of their boy. That revelation would detonate the fiery Laura. Under these high stakes, nimble director Michael Mann, 80, balances the human crisis with riveting racing scenes climaxing in the Mille Miglia sequence, a thousand-mile competition across Italy. Action and soul: Ferrari is a fierce, moving Oscar competitor by a modern master. —T.M.A. Does God exist? What would 20th-century intellectuals Sigmund Freud (Anthony Hopkins, 85) and Oxford don C.S. Lewis (Matthew Goode) have discussed if they’d met in Freud’s London townhouse in the waning days of the pain-wracked father of psychoanalysis? As England enters World War II, the men circle each other, poking at past traumas and issues of faith over a single soggy afternoon. This kind of historical two-hander, perfected in Frost/Nixon and The Queen, is a narrative trick, like a locked-room mystery. Despite the fascinating subject, the challenge is to fully develop the characters, aim them at each other and await fireworks. Unfortunately, these screenwriters feel like they’re struggling to strike a wet match. Moments of spark exist: when WWI vet Lewis freaks out during an air raid or when Freud defensively refutes his own twisted relationship with his daughter, child psychiatry pioneer Anna Freud (Babylon Berlin’s memorable Liv Lisa Fries). Yet Freud’s Last Session never quite catches fire. —T.M.A. The Boys in the Boat is 62-year-old director George Clooney’s Chariots of Fire. That champion won four Oscars in 1982. This gorgeously filmed and scored (also dated and predictable) drama stirs up the real-life underdog tale of the University of Washington JV crew team. It’s the Depression; adversity reigns. “Hobo” Joe Rantz (tall, towheaded Callum Turner) has never attended a regatta, but the student’s been living rough and tuition’s overdue. He tries out, hoping for a cot and three squares. Crusty Coach Al Ulbrickson (a dour Joel Edgerton) recruits the newbie, while the university threatens to gut his budget. Coach needs a win — and gets one (triumphant cheering!), as his JV Huskies flex their biceps, row, row, rowing their shell all the way to the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Nodding to the past, there’s a brief encounter with Olympian Jesse Owens, and the bonus of aggravating Adolf Hitler, a peevish mustached man observing from the stands. —T.M.A. Bummed by Part 1’s finale, the death of Diana? In its final six episodes, The Crown moves on to happier times: the Golden Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II (Imelda Staunton, 67), the marriage of Prince Charles (Dominic West, 54) and Camilla (Olivia Williams, 55) and the college romance of Prince William (Ed McVey) and Kate Middleton (Meg Bellamy). Sorry, no Prince Harry and Meghan Markle romance on this show (creator Peter Morgan, 60, has suggested that those events are too recent to be included). The latest Japanese-produced Godzilla movie from Japan's Toho Studio takes the character back to his roots even as it reinvents him. Set in the late 1940s, it focuses on a group of ordinary citizens, including an ex-navy pilot who rejected a kamikaze mission, and a young woman who takes in an orphaned girl. They embark on a people's crusade against Godzilla, a dinosaur-like creature made gigantic by atomic testing, because the government refuses to take responsibility for dealing with him. Borrowing from an array of classic movies, including the original Jaws, this is a rare giant monster movie where the human relationships are as compelling as the scenes where the big guy stomps and incinerates cities. —Matt Zoller Seitz (M.Z.S.) Jeffrey Wright, 58, owns 2023. The brilliant actor delivered a mighty profile as Rustin’s Rep. Adam Clayton Powell and now carries Cord Jefferson’s brainy, acerbic comedy as the enraged Thelonius “Monk” Ellison, an academic whose latest erudite novel is a least-seller. When he encounters a Black woman novelist whose breakout debut employs young urban speech, the writer confronts market realities. As Monk attempts to prove that he, too, can write pandering fiction, he gets drawn back into his affluent family’s orbit. Mother Leslie Uggams, 80, and siblings Tracee Ellis Ross, 51, and Sterling K. Brown form a formidable family unit (with their New England beach house, the Ellisons are more seaside lane than city street). Both a family dramedy and a sharp take on publishing’s failures, American Fiction also reflects the concerns of a microcosm of Black artists working in Hollywood, navigating systemic racism while expected to deliver stories with “street cred,” whatever that means — and to whom — on any particular day. —T.M.A. Timothée Chalamet exudes wide-eyed charm as chocolatier Willy Wonka struggling to set up his first shop as a 20-something orphan. (Curiously, he flashes no hint of the menace or cynicism that Gene Wilder famously brought to the role in the original 1971 film.) This sunshiny Wonka is surrounded by an overstuffed cast that includes a plumped-up Keegan-Michael Key, 52, Olivia Colman (in full camp mode) and Hugh Grant, 63 (who goes all in as a diminutive Oompa Loompa). Paul King, the filmmaker behind the two justly praised live-action Paddington movies, brings a visual flair to the enterprise, which boasts several well-choreographed production numbers and new songs that mesh nicely with classics such as “Pure Imagination.” The candy-colored visuals go a long way to compensate for a script that can be a muddle, stretched taffy-thin by too many villains, subplots and characters who are not given much to do. —Thom Geier (T.G.) Among the most chilling photographs displayed at Berlin’s Topography of Terror museum is this image: smiling female Auschwitz guards enjoying their day off, steins raised, at a beer garden. Jonathan Glazer, 58, sets his Oscar-bound Holocaust drama The Zone of Interest nearby, at the compound of Camp Commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel, Babylon Berlin) and his wife, Hedwig (Sandra Huller, also in the much-buzzed Anatomy of a Fall). Their happy home, with its lush garden (fertilized with suspicious ash) and playful children, shelters a family striving for a bourgeois life within sniffing distance of the spewing chimneys at the infamous concentration camp. Like the photo at the Topography of Terror, the movie shows the banality of wickedness. For the Höss family, life goes on amid the scurrying, starving prisoner-servants underfoot as the patriarch rises due to his genocidal efficiency. Their prosperous garden of evil, fueled by denial, is an atrocity of complicity, and a timely remembrance. —T.M.A. Emma Stone goes far out on a limb — and then leaps without a net — in her second outrageous collaboration with Yorgos Lanthimos, 50 (The Favourite). Stone delivers a sexy, physically demanding and outlandish performance that exists in an artistic universe far, far away from the mainstream gloss of Spiderman’s saucy girlfriend Gwen. She plays Bella Baxter, a young suicide given an electric shock at a second life by the compassionate but cray-cray scientist Dr. Godwin Baxter (a sublimely ridiculous Willem Dafoe, 68). His bumpy, scarred visage reflects his predilection for self-experimentation, while Bella is his beauty. Mark Ruffalo, 56, flexes his comic chops as a Bella-obsessed gent who has no idea what she’s capable of — or of his own limitations. Part Frankenstein, part Galatea, Bella has a learning curve that’s swift, unexpected and driven by unrestrained appetites. Although Poor Things occasionally careens into extreme whimsy, it’s a gorgeously shot, designed and costumed portrait of an incomparable woman on the verge of a fantastical breakthrough. —T.M.A. Long ago, when my two grown kids were little, I adored animation. Then it became something like eating too many hot dogs — I never again craved wieners or hyper cartoons. The major exception is the creations of Japanese genius Hayao Miyazaki, 82. His latest movie is true to form: unhurried, tender and wise. Nearly every frame of this artistic masterpiece inspires awe. His visions of undulating waters, flickering flames and sunlight cracking cloud cover have sublime detail, composition and color. The story itself offers wonder, humor and life lessons that don’t reduce to “Eat your broccoli.” The hero of this feature, which Miyazaki claims to be his last, is a motherless boy. Mahito encounters a heron, a magical creature symbolizing good luck, a fowl capable of moving among three elements: earth, water and air. Together, bird and orphan cross the thin membrane between life and death, encountering strange and marvelous creatures, and inhabiting a visually thrilling story that represents the very best in bold contemporary animation and popular art. —T.M.A. Sam Esmail, best known for creating Mr. Robot, directed and co-adapted this movie based on the unsettling best-selling book. A family of four (led by Julia Roberts, 56, and Ethan Hawke, 53) rents a ritzy vacation home on Long Island — only to be interrupted by a man and his daughter (Mahershala Ali and Myha’la Herrold), who turn up claiming the house is really theirs and a cyberattack has forced them to seek shelter in a familiar place. Prepare to be unnerved in all the right ways. Like the real Mary Kay Letourneau — jailed for bedding a 12-year-old she later married and had children with — this film’s Gracie (Julianne Moore, 62) was jailed for having sex with young Joe (Charles Melton, 32). Now they’re married and about to send their teens off to college. She strenuously denies she ever did anything wrong, though Joe is having midlife doubts. Director Todd Haynes, 62, makes it even more unsettling by introducing TV star Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who’s going to play Gracie in a movie, so they let her live with and study them way too intimately. The Joe-Gracie dynamic is like Gus Van Sant’s To Die For; the Elizabeth-Gracie clash recalls Ingmar Bergman’s Persona. The result is a creepy master class in acting.  This account of the warrior ruler who defined 19th century Europe is the sort of stuff epic director Ridley Scott, 85, eats for breakfast. Here he reunites with his Gladiator villain Joaquin Phoenix, whose take on Napoleon is frequently fresh and often funny (deliberately so). Scott brings an almost classical sense of spectacle to the often pulpy script by David Scarpa and gives each detailed battle scene its own distinct color palette. As Napoleon’s love Josephine, Vanessa Kirby is an apt volleyer for Phoenix’s eccentricity. The movie’s 158-minute length is substantial, but given how eventful its subject’s life was, Napoleon practically gallops along. —Glenn Kenny (G.K.) Set 64 years before the 2012 hit about Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), the young badass who volunteered to fight to the death on TV in a dystopian future, the Hunger Games prequel stars not Lawrence but Rachel Zegler (from the West Side Story remake) as fighter Lucy Gray. It’s mainly the origin story of future villain Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth). Like Anakin Skywalker before he morphed into Darth Vader, Snow starts off sympathetic, an ambitious but nice guy from a genteel but financially strapped family. He falls for Lucy (who has a Southern accent for some reason and dresses and sings like a minor country star), whom he’s assigned to mentor to win the deadly game. At 157 minutes, it’s overlong, but Blyth and Zegler have chemistry and real acting chops, and his not-so-heroic journey is a nicely nuanced portrait of how someone started out before breaking bad. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Socially awkward scholarship nerd Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin) develops a possibly fatal attraction to tall, charismatic rich kid Jacob Elordi (Elvis Presley in Priscilla) in this satirical drama written and directed by Emerald Fennell, following up her acclaimed Promising Young Woman. It’s as if the filmmaker pureed Joseph Losey’s 1963 class-clash drama The Servant, Pier Paolo Pasolini’s 1968 satire Teorema and bits of Monty Python and Peter Greenaway, and baked them in an overheated oven. Consistently perverse and often visually startling, it’s nevertheless weirdly unsatisfying. But it’s worth it to see Richard E. Grant, 66, and Rosamund Pike, highly entertaining as Elordi’s dotty parents. —G.K. The enormous potential of historical movies is to resurrect heroes scratched from the official record — like Bayard Rustin. The charismatic, gay believer in Gandhi's peaceful civil disobedience orchestrated Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 March on Washington in a matter of weeks. Oscar-bound Colman Domingo, 53, brilliantly embodies the Civil Rights grassroots activist while showing a powerful man with a joy for living and compassion for his fellow men. The tragedy — and the root of the film’s complexity — is that Rustin’s sexuality put him at odds with some in the movement’s inner circle, revealing that their dedication to equality had limits. With exquisite music from Branford Marsalis, 63, and a stellar supporting cast including Aml Ameen as Martin Luther King Jr. and Jeffrey Wright, 57, as Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Rustin is a bold and generous movie that sets its conventional biopic wrapper on fire. —T.M.A. Director Alexander Payne, 62, made actor Paul Giamatti, 56, famous in his 2004 wine-country comedy Sideways. They reunite in an Oscar-touted, record-setting Toronto Film Festival hit about a curmudgeon (Giamatti’s specialty) who teaches at a New England prep school and is stuck on campus to babysit a few students over Christmas break in the early 1970s. He bonds with one chronic misfit kid (Dominic Sessa) and the school’s cook (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), who’s mourning her son, a former student at the school who was accepted at Swarthmore but, cash-poor, was sent to die in Vietnam. It’s a hilarious, poignant movie in a beautiful, character-rich retro-1970s style. It’s a Christmas movie as uplifting as the saddest of Christmas songs, and as full of hope against all odds. —T.A. Annette Bening is generating Oscar buzz for this biopic of Diana Nyad, a competitive swimmer who long dreamed of swimming from Cuba to Florida. Decades after a failed attempt at age 28, she returned to the waters to try again. And again. And again. With the support of a loyal friend (Jodie Foster, 60) and coach (Rhys Ifans, 56), she eschews a shark cage and battles both jellyfish and the elements in the feel-good story of one stubborn and determined woman. Lily Gladstone is the beating heart of Martin Scorsese’s historical true-crime drama about the reign of terror in 1920s Osage County, Oklahoma. The wealthy diabetic Mollie Burkhart comes to represent the Osage Nation, who are living in frontier luxury after oil was discovered beneath their communal land. Scorsese, 80, lushly re-creates the oil-rush backwater, with its muddy streets, fancy motorcars and tribal pageantry. However, the director miscasts 48-year-old Leonardo DiCaprio as 28-year-old Ernest Burkhart, Mollie’s white seducer. They wed but the seemingly dutiful husband has divided loyalties, remaining obligated to his uncle, rancher William Hale (quietly terrifying Robert De Niro, 80). Hale architects a murderous conspiracy to profit from the Osage birthright. As the body count rises, including Mollie’s two sisters, coincidence turns to conviction — and the greedy culprits must be brought to justice. The juicy period piece based on the nonfiction bestseller by David Grann gets the Hollywood star treatment, but a multipart series with age-appropriate male stars might have better-served the grim chapter’s complexities. —T.M.A. Writers Sandra (standout Sandra Hüller) and Vincent (Swann Arlaud) share a remote alpine chalet with their 11-year-old son, Daniel, but their marriage is strained. What makes this elegant, gripping crime thriller (and Cannes Film Festival winner) unusual is that the pot never boils. When an attractive journalist comes to interview the more successful Sandra, an unseen Vincent blasts music to disrupt their conversation. How passive-aggressive — or is his behavior something angrier? Later, he tumbles from the third-floor window, bloodying the snow below. The narrative pivots, becoming a courtroom drama with Sandra in the dock, accused of suspicious death. Her vision-impaired son is the sole material witness. Daniel has knowledge of what occurred in the house — but how reliable is he? Is he loyal to his surviving mother, or to his late father? Did Sandra or didn’t she? If only those chalet walls could talk. —T.M.A. Ounce by ounce of plutonium, this biopic of the father of the atomic bomb is pretty genius — but it’s no Albert Einstein (played by Tom Conti, 81, in an essential cameo). The story ricochets through time and space fast as a photon, plotting the arc of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Oscar-bound Cillian Murphy). As head of the Manhattan Project, the left-leaning, womanizing physicist passionately pursues pioneering atomic science. But he can’t live with his baby, the bomb that decimated Hiroshima, ending World War II. The sprawling drama is a dazzling cinematic achievement boosted by muscular performances from Robert Downey Jr., 58, Matt Damon, 52, and Jason Clarke, 54, and a huge cast of characters with complicated collisions. Showstopper Florence Pugh seduces as the communist mistress Oppie dumps for career and the missus (Emily Blunt). Perhaps in trimming the story to three hours, some of the male-female narrative connective tissue was cut, which may be why, for all its fascinating moving parts, the busy biopic isn’t more emotionally explosive. —T.M.A. Hot pink in the summertime: That’s the new Barbie. And, whoopsie, she’s having an existential crisis. When the Mattel doll (a perfectly cast Margot Robbie) leaves her platonic pal Ken (hunky Ryan Gosling) for the real world, she gets a big surprise. Unlike her native Barbieland, a girl-power utopia where plastic playthings are presidents and Supreme Court justices, she confronts the patriarchy. Over at Mattel, the CEO (Will Ferrell, 56) presides over an all-male board that won’t play nice and wants to put her in a box. Throughout, the tone is playfully ironic with a side of preach. The biggest joy is in the endless runway of familiar doll costumes and the cotton candy sets. Robbie makes a genial ringmaster, with a terrific cast that includes Rhea Perlman, 75, America Ferrera and a slew of starry Barbies and Kens. Is Barbie a feminist? The movie replies with a chorus of “yes!” —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP.

"Jul 21, 2023"," The Church publishes the Monitor because it sees good journalism as vital to progress in the world. Since 1908, we’ve aimed “to injure no man, but to bless all mankind,” as our founder, Mary Baker Eddy, put it. Here, you’ll find award-winning journalism not driven by commercial influences – a news organization that takes seriously its mission to uplift the world by seeking solutions and finding reasons for credible hope. “Oppenheimer,” the new Christopher Nolan movie starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, “the father of the atomic bomb,” does not present itself as a simple biopic. Instead, it’s scaled to be the biopic of all biopics. It also functions as a kind of explosive device all on its own, igniting questions and controversies about the morality of warfare, the bloody crossroads between science and politics, the limits of power, and much else in the deepthink realm. Nolan is perhaps best known for the “Dark Knight” movies, but forget Batman. For Nolan, Oppenheimer is the ultimate hero martyr. This is a lot of baggage for any movie to carry, especially a big Hollywood movie shot in IMAX and aimed at a popular audience. Perhaps inevitably, it falls short of its ambitions. But it’s bracing to see a studio movie these days, particularly one with such huge scope, that at least attempts to serve up more than recycled goods. Its time frame, as is often the case in Nolan’s films, is nonlinear, shuttling mostly between Oppenheimer’s life as a physicist heading up the top-secret Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, New Mexico, and his eventual downfall more than a decade later in the red-baiting McCarthy era. The switching back and forth is unwieldy, and there is yet a third major postwar section involving Oppenheimer’s chief nemesis, former Atomic Energy Commission Chair Lewis Strauss (a great Robert Downey Jr., in the film’s best performance). And yet, to some extent, the unwieldiness contributes to the film’s overall sense of almost apocalyptic doominess. Past, present, and future events bleed into each other, offering no escape routes. A mass of contradictions, Oppenheimer is not your typical movie hero, or even antihero. Intellectually prodigious from an early age, he was also unapologetically arrogant, a womanizer, fatally naive about the ways of the world, and, with his signature pork pie hat, also something of a dandy. He was also a Communist sympathizer in his early years, although, unlike his brother (Dylan Arnold) and a handful of friends, or his troubled lover and his wife, he was never a party member. As Jean Tatlock, the doctor with whom Oppenheimer was having an affair, Florence Pugh brings her trademark intensity, while Emily Blunt is too little used as Kitty Oppenheimer. Her husband’s political sympathies would normally have been enough to disqualify him to head the team that eventually created the atomic bombs that fell on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing more than 100,000 people. But the project’s director, Gen. Leslie Groves (a strong Matt Damon), decided otherwise – even though it had been reported to him that Oppenheimer “couldn’t run a hamburger stand.” Nolan sees Oppenheimer as both a man of flesh and blood, and a holy martyr. There aren’t many emotional levels to Murphy’s performance – the real Oppenheimer was notoriously charming – but Murphy has the requisite saintly, slightly famished look that Nolan no doubt sought. (It’s the same look as the photo that graces the cover of the 2005 Oppenheimer biography “American Prometheus,” the movie’s primary source, by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin.) The great physicist saved the world only to usher in a more dangerous world of deadlier hydrogen bombs. His opposition to those bombs led to charges of disloyalty and capped his downfall. As a visual artist, Nolan can be compelling and immersive, as in the Los Alamos scenes, or overwrought, as in a few fantastical sequences that resemble jumbo planetarium light shows. The thunderous score by Ludwig Göransson, which tends to drown out the actors, is in the movie to make doubly sure we are impressed with the momentousness of the material. Nolan needn’t have worried. Oppenheimer’s moral crises are intensely personal but on such a monumental scale that they take on the dimensions of myth. They justify the bigness of this three-hour movie. Famously quoting from the Bhagavad-Gita, a Hindu scripture, in the aftermath of the successful atomic bomb test, Oppenheimer softly mutters to himself, “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” Awestruck and aghast, there is not a trace of self-importance to his words. That A-bomb test sequence is the film’s great centerpiece. The infernal fire seems to reach infinity. What isn’t widely known is that the Los Alamos scientists were not entirely sure the explosion would not destroy the planet. What connects this movie to our present day is the realization that this nuclear horror could still happen. “Oppenheimer” is more than an epic biopic. It’s an epic cautionary tale. Monitor journalism changes lives because we open that too-small box that most people think they live in. We believe news can and should expand a sense of identity and possibility beyond narrow conventional expectations. “Many things that end up” being meaningful, writes social scientist Joseph Grenny, “have come from conference workshops, articles, or online videos that began as a chore and ended with an insight. My work in Kenya, for example, was heavily influenced by a Christian Science Monitor article I had forced myself to read 10 years earlier. Sometimes, we call things ‘boring’ simply because they lie outside the box we are currently in.” If you were to come up with a punchline to a joke about the Monitor, that would probably be it. We’re seen as being global, fair, insightful, and perhaps a bit too earnest. We’re the bran muffin of journalism. But you know what? We change lives. And I’m going to argue that we change lives precisely because we force open that too-small box that most human beings think they live in. The Monitor is a peculiar little publication that’s hard for the world to figure out. We’re run by a church, but we’re not only for church members and we’re not about converting people. We’re known as being fair even as the world becomes as polarized as at any time since the newspaper’s founding in 1908. We have a mission beyond circulation, we want to bridge divides. We’re about kicking down the door of thought everywhere and saying, “You are bigger and more capable than you realize. And we can prove it.” If you’re looking for bran muffin  journalism, you can subscribe to the Monitor for $15.

"Jul 21, 2023"," “Go big or go home,” the filmmaking of Christopher Nolan screams. From Dunkirk to Interstellar to Inception to Tenet to his Batman movies, Nolan proffers big ideas, big scope, big sound and big film stock (70 mm IMAX). J. Robert Oppenheimer offered the same to the United States military in World War II, just with a different conjunction: “Go big AND go home.” In other words, he gave America the biggest weapon the world had ever seen, allowing our troops to return stateside. So you’d think the two would be a perfect match. Well, it turns out there is such a thing as too big. For while the master craftsman has engineered a compelling and occasionally powerful production, Oppenheimer is also unnecessarily frenetic, unfocused, loud, overscored and just plain confusing. It’s impossible to fully resist its vigor and panache, but after being bombarded with trailer-type pacing and sound for three hours, this critic was relieved when the 70mm projector flickered dark. That’s not to say that said projector doesn’t display moments of profound beauty, not just in the film print’s color, clarity and light, but also in the movie itself, which takes us from the early career of Oppenheimer, through World War II, to Oppenheimer’s post-war career and controversies. And several performances are memorable, particularly Cillian Murphy in the title role and Matt Damon as the top military official on the Manhattan Project. Florence Pugh, as Oppenheimer’s one-time girlfriend and subsequent mistress, is quite good, and quite naked. Emily Blunt, as his wife, can’t rely on the scene-stealing technique of getting nude, but she still does reasonably well with the limited action the screenplay gives her. Most of the other members of the stellar ensemble (Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Josh Harnett, Alden Ehrenreich and Kenneth Branagh, to name a few) get a bit lost, though. (Not lost is Robert Downey Jr., but more on him later.) And cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (perhaps the best in the business not named Roger Deakins) deserves praise, as does the practical-effects crew. Oppenheimer is at its best when it’s one part contemplative (as when a conflicted title character confronts the bomb’s moral complexities), one part surreal (particularly in a scene of haunting montage) and one part quiet (which is almost never). But it struggles as a bio-pic. Indeed, it’s not really a bio-pic at all. Instead, it’s a drama-thriller that, in typical Nolan style, jumps around in time and place. That approach has worked well for the director in the past, particularly with Dunkirk, but it’s exhausting here, especially when it’s focusing on Lewis Strauss (Downey), the former chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Shockingly, Nolan spends more time on Strauss than on the science behind the bomb. That might have worked well in the 2005 biography American Prometheus (by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin), upon which Nolan based his screenplay, but it almost ruins the film. Simply put, Nolan takes his eye off the ball, or, more precisely, the bomb. Maybe he should have heeded the words of President Truman, who, in a badly misrepresented cameo, reminds Oppenheimer that the Japanese don’t care who made the bomb, only who dropped it. Transpose that sentiment to the film, and one is reminded that however interesting the story of Oppenheimer (and however uninteresting the story of Strauss), the bombs (Trinity, Little Boy and Fat Man) will always be the main characters in this tale. And despite Nolan’s best intentions, relegating the bombs to supporting roles is tantamount to James Cameron spending most of his time on events prior to and after Titanic’s maiden voyage while giving short shrift to the ship. That decision doesn’t sink Oppenheimer, but it’s an iceberg just off the starboard bow.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 21, 2023"," The most devastating impact of a nuclear bomb is the fallout. Just ask J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man who forever changed the world by championing man’s most destructive force then had to live with hands stained by the blood of 200,000 Japanese citizens. It’s hard to imagine how a mortal conscience could contemplate such a catastrophic event. No one but the man himself could know. But Christopher Nolan’s spectacular “Oppenheimer” offers a credible approximation by placing us inside the conflicted mind of a brilliant scientist who knew almost instantly that his insatiable love of quantum mechanics facilitated an invention that would forever strike fear in the hearts of mankind. It’s hard to know where to begin in praising a film that pushes the boundaries of how far modern cinema can take you when entrusted to a visionary like Christopher Nolan. Be it acting, special effects, cinematography, or sound, he demands – and receives – the best his cast and crew have to offer. But I believe the core of this explosive movie is its previously unsung linchpin, Cillian Murphy. The “Peaky Blinders” star is magnificent, an immediate Oscar contender, in his uncanny ability to portray a man at war with himself, and to do so in such a heartfelt and empathetic manner. His Oppenheimer seldom feels comfortable in his skin, even though he’s fully aware he’s always the smartest guy in the room. That dichotomy is a through line that seldom wavers as Nolan’s script seamlessly weaves key periods of Oppenheimer’s life into a near-flawless tapestry. At first, the repeated jumps in time and place are a bit disconcerting. But once you’ve succumbed to Nolan’s nonlinear strategy, you’re all in on a story that is equal parts triumph and tragedy. The central locale is Los Alamos, New Mexico, the infamous self-contained city where Oppenheimer and the world’s most renowned physicists conceived, built and tested a weapon they knew had the potential to destroy the entire planet – by accident. It’s beyond chilling when Oppenheimer matter-of-factly opines that his $2 billion baby could ignite the entire atmosphere. The prospect is merely the price of doing business for Oppenheimer and his team. But for Gen. Leslie Groves, the commanding officer of the Manhattan Project, it evokes shockwaves that in the capable hands of Matt Damon reflect our own inescapable feelings of dread. And it won’t be the last time Nolan preys on an overwhelming sense of unease in creating more than a few moral quandaries that expound upon the central theme of forging peace through devastation. Chief among them is Oppenheimer’s post-war nemesis, Lewis Strauss, a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission. He’s played in a wondrous turn by an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr., devouring every opportunity to inflict bureaucratic villainy on an American hero. His scenes are predominantly shot in black and white, as he and his staff navigate a Senate hearing weighing his nomination as Eisenhower’s secretary of commerce. Essentially, Strauss loves the bomb to the point of vehemently lobbying for developing an even more potent hydrogen version. But Oppenheimer, and his increasingly guilty conscience, foresee the future and fear the implications of an escalating arms race. Considering this is the heyday of the Red Scare, Strauss isn’t the only politician eager to quash Oppenheimer’s premonition of doom. It starts with Harry Truman (a terrific Gary Oldman) and trickles down to a tribunal charged with putting Oppenheimer in his place via the ruthless grilling of special counsel Roger Robb (a solid Jason Clarke). As he proved with “Dunkirk,” Nolan is a master at juggling place and time. He exhibits that same expertise, as we jump back and forth over a 30-year period from Washington, Los Alamos, San Francisco and Princeton University, where Oppenheimer meets up with the genius he hopes to surpass, Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). The back and forth is artfully executed, but the glue holding it together is Murphy, his hypnotic blue eyes providing a magnetic portal into the brain of a slightly mad scientist entrusted with nothing short of saving the world. Murphy is outstanding, and his resemblance to the real Robert Oppenheimer is eerie. He appears in practically every scene and is tasked with expressing a spectrum of emotions, no small feat when fleshing out a figure famous for his unflinching stoicism. What I like most about his performance is his willingness to venture beyond merely playing the hero, reaching deep to unmask Oppenheimer’s myriad character flaws. Chief among them, his casual readiness to cheat on his long-suffering wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), with Jean Tatlock, the woman who knew how to fuel Oppenheimer’s reactor. She’s played by Florence Pugh, frequently sans clothing, and it’s a gutsy bit of acting few actresses could pull off so confidently. She’s more the rule than the exception in a cast that includes Rami Malek as the John Dean of the piece whose David Hill goes before the Senate committee to expose Oppenheimer’s denouncers for what they are, frauds. He’s joined by fellow Oscar winners Casey Affleck and Kenneth Branagh in a dazzling display of star power matched only by the gorgeous cinematography by Nolan regular, Hoyte van Hoytema. His camera work on a pivotal scene in which the test bomb, Trinity, is fired just before dawn (on July 16, 1945) in the New Mexican desert is a thing of beauty. But it’s also intentionally terrifying, as it jarringly demonstrates the sheer power generated through fission. If there are nits to pick, they are with the film’s butt-numbing length (3 hours) and its irksome short shrift given the two women who shaped Oppenheimer into a purveyor of peace later in life. But it came at a huge cost to his credibility and reputation. Was he a card-carrying communist, as his critics claimed? Or was he merely a progressive scholar who sought to explore new possibilities? Nolan makes no bones in expressing his opinion. But politics aside, his “Oppenheimer” is a colossal achievement that deserves to be seen on the largest, loudest screen possible. Simply put, it’s da bomb.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," We all want to leave our mark on this world. Something good that contributes to the progress of society. For most of us, any impact we make will likely be small, whether it’s a good deed here or there or just doing our part in making the world a slightly better place to live. Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer would make one of the greatest impacts on the world and change all of humanity in the process as the “father of the atomic bomb.” Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer explores the complicated nature and tormented anguish of bearing that responsibility. Not only does everyone involved deliver the best of their talents, but the film’s story is a haunting reminder of humanity’s lust for power and fear of those who have it. Oppenheimer is Nolan’s magnum opus and a triumph of science and destruction. Talking place throughout various points in Oppenheimer’s life, Oppenheimer follows the rise of the theoretical physicist as he dives into unexplored theories across science. His research in the field leads to him being recruited by the government to build a “device” that could put an end to World War II, a bomb bigger than anything that has been seen before in existence. Under the strictest security, Oppenheimer builds an entire community of scientists to do the impossible as they race against both the Germans and the Russians to get there first. Meanwhile, there are also glimpses of the resulting fallout from the creation of the atomic bomb, and Oppenheimer’s security clearance is looked at when his own ties to communism come into question as he deals with carrying the burden of feeling responsible for the bombings in Japan. Oppenheimer is a 3-hour biographical drama on the creation of the first atomic bomb. It’s pretty much all science and mathematics and no action. And yet Nolan has you on the edge of your seat for nearly the entire time thanks to his tightly written script, superb acting, and tense score. As I mentioned earlier, we all have a desire to impact this world in one way or another. Everyone knows the impact the creation of the atomic bomb had on society. It’s that knowledge of knowing exactly where everything is leading to that helps build the tension. Oppenheimer has a belief that the work he is doing is for the good of the world. He believes that it’s better for the United States to have this technology first and that it falling into the hands of Germany would be a much worse outcome. That is why he continues to push forward despite the horrific levels of destruction the science is telling him. He believes in science, but he puts his faith in society. He hopes that sole creation of an atomic bomb would be enough to put an end to the war and that it wouldn’t have to actually be put to use. We all know how that turned out. J. Robert Oppenheimer’s trust in society is misguided. Once the bomb is out of the bag, there is no putting it back in. The science and math showed that there was a near zero chance the bomb would ignite the atmosphere and essentially blow up the entire world. Yet they still moved forward. Those odds match how Oppenheimer believed the world would react to its creation. Deep down he knew there was a miniscule chance that the world would see the destructive potential of the bomb and that it would lead to peace, without it having to be actually used. He knew exactly what the United States would do with it once it was finished, though. The stress and torment placed upon Oppenheimer is played perfectly by Cillian Murphy, his gaunt and thin frame weighed down by ramifications of his life’s work. Nolan captures every minute detail in Murphy’s performance, best seen on either IMAX or 70mm or both in the theater. Every wrinkle, every twitch, every strain is captured is glorious detail. The camera provides a window into the soul of the characters to a point where you can see the cogs turning in their heads, adding deeper levels to the dialogue. You feel the tension and exhaustion placed on Oppenheimer’s shoulders as he races against the Germans to complete the bomb first. The bomb itself is only the fuse for the film, setting off a chain reaction of thoughts and emotions made all the more powerful by the hindsight of today. Christopher Nolan does an amazing job at building the tension throughout the course of the film. Every character is committed to a purpose and while Cillian Murphy is always front and center, the phenomenal supporting cast are always there to remind audiences just how high the stakes are. Like Apollo 13, Oppenheimer builds suspense through science and math. Quantum physics is hard to explain, but the film does an excellent job at dumbing it down enough for it to make sense. A glass bowl filled with marbles represents the amount of uranium needed for the bomb. Every so often we see a handful of marbles get added to the bowl as it gets closer and closer to being filled as the science continues to march on towards the inevitable. Ludwig Göransson’s amazing score adds so much to the film’s dialogue, turning fairly normal conversations into mini tension-filled warheads that could explode at any moment. The film does lose some momentum after the test explosion occurs as there is still a good portion of the film left, but things never become boring. Oppenheimer is a double-edged blade. On one hand, it’s a triumph of human intellect, a celebration of what man can achieve through science and math all working together. On the other hand, it also represents the horrors we are capable of. Christopher Nolan brilliantly captures that complexity on screen. J. Robert Oppenheimer’s impact, along with all those involved in the Manhattan Project, continues to ripple through to this day. It’s a haunting and stark reminder of the power we hold in our hands. Nuclear weapons are forever here to stay, and we must all deal with the fallout. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer explores the complicated nature and tormented anguish of bearing that responsibility. Not only does everyone involved deliver the best of their talents, but the film’s story is a haunting reminder of humanity’s lust for power and fear of those who have it. Oppenheimer is Nolan’s magnum opus and a triumph of science and destruction.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," 
Jeanne: The moniker “father of the atomic bomb” might not be a
life goal for everyone, but for J. Robert Oppenheimer, lead scientist of the Manhattan Project which developed the weapon of mass destruction, it was something he was certainly driven to accomplish.
Writer/director Christopher Nolan’s long-awaited film, OPPENHEIMER, takes “the audience into the mind and the experience of a person who sat at the absolute center of the largest shift in history”
according to Nolan. 
Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ by Kai Bird
and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan was himself obsessed with bringing the story of this brilliant scientist to the big screen in a way only he could. Filmed with IMAX cameras, this bigger-than-life
chronicle of Oppenheimer, played by Cillian Murphy, and his very select team and all the other supporting characters, is spread across decades, from his time at Cambridge University to a select
hearing in 1954 conducted in secrecy, which would ultimately strip him of his U.S. government security clearance. 
Recruited by Brigadier General Leslie Groves, Jr. (Matt Damon), director of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer assembled an
impressive group of elite scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the atomic bomb, a project that was already two years behind the Germans. Physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Niels
Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), the 1922 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), “father of the hydrogen bomb” and Oppenheimer’s younger brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold), were a few
of the other geniuses selected to participate. And all were present at “Trinity”, the codename for the explosion site, where on July 16, 1945, their work was finally tested. 
But OPPENHEIMER is about so much more than the bomb and all the machinations that went into making it. It turns out that the
accomplished Dr. Oppenheimer was also something of a womanizer. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a Stanford-educated psychiatrist, is a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and
one of Oppenheimer’s lovers. His wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), who was married to someone else when she met Oppenheimer, is also a gifted biologist who ends up taking a back seat to her husband’s work
and suffers dearly because of it. She doesn’t exactly conform to the norms of mother and wife, but she is devoted to Oppenheimer in her own way. 
And then there is Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), who in 1947 was a founding commissioner of the Atomic Energy
Commission. It is Strauss who prevails upon Oppenheimer to become director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton University, also in 1947. Their precarious relationship was made even more
so when Oppenheimer humiliates Strauss during a Senate hearing. He exacts his revenge upon Oppenheimer, thus causing him to lose that security clearance, ending his role in government and shaping
policy for nuclear power. 
Apparently, when Nolan calls, actors answer and are thrilled to do so. Murphy, who had worked with the director before, but
not in a starring role, jumped at the opportunity to play Oppenheimer --- and he is sublime. His deeply angled face and wide expressive eyes lend themselves to this complicated, astonishing,
fascinating man. It’s a masterful portrayal by Murphy --- seriously riveting. You can’t look away when he’s on screen --- and he’s on screen a lot. He will be a contender for Best Actor come Oscar
season. 
The other two big Oscar possibilities are Downey, Jr. and Blunt. Each is magnetic in their roles. Blunt is effortlessly
quietly dynamic, playing the alcoholic Kitty with honesty and the toughness a wife in her position needs. She’s just so good it’s unnerving. Downey, Jr. is downright spectacular. Strauss’
bitterness --- and pettiness --- is on full display in his portrayal. He’s at once smarmy and yet captivating. During Strauss’ Senate confirmation hearing you can feel --- smell --- his desperation.
Strauss is the role of a lifetime for this highly skilled actor. 
OPPENHEIMER is a major feat for all involved. The editing by Jennifer Lame is incredible, though personally, I think Nolan
could have trimmed at least 20 minutes off the running time of 180 and still maintained the film’s integrity. There are a few scenes in which the story lags and could possibly be detrimental to the
overall reception to OPPENHEIMER. But despite its length, David managed to stay awake. Bravo, David! 
The massive cast is amazing with each member adding to the success of this monumental undertaking. And I would be remiss in
not mentioning the powerful performance by Damon, who never seems to disappoint. But for such an important narrative, things such as production designs, cinematography, costumes and music are
paramount. 
Ruth De Jong is the designer responsible for the jaw-dropping sets and locations. Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema
has worked with Nolan four times, including INTERSTELLAR, TENET and DUNKIRK. The meticulous costumes, including Oppenheimer’s legendary hat, are courtesy of Ellen Mirojnick, her first time working
with Nolan, and the striking score was created by Oscar-winning composer, Ludwig GÖransson,
who also wrote the music for TENET. 
OPPENHEIMER is by far Nolan’s best film to date. It’s an exquisite examination of one man’s determination to save the world
by ending World War II --- and then his self- recrimination for having done so. The brilliance of J. Robert Oppenheimer is eclipsed by the importance of his story. 
David: Well, it was worth the wait. For almost a year at a major
crossroads in LA, writer/director Christopher Nolan teased thousands of motorists every day with a giant billboard counting down exactly when his film OPPENHEIMER would be released. Beginning
September 22, 2022, the huge sign, with a tagline of “The World Forever to Change”, was recording the months, days, hours, minutes and seconds elapsed until July 21, 2023. 
I’m guessing this precursor for his movie about the man who invented the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had a lot of
people scrambling to Google or Wikipedia to learn what “Oppenheimer” meant. However, after the searing portrayal of the title character by Cillian Murphy, the name Oppenheimer will no longer be a
mystery. In fact, Murphy, in his sixth collaboration with Nolan, has likely established himself as the actor to beat at next year’s Academy Awards. 
An amazing ensemble cast brings this story to life. The actors include Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Florence
Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Dane De Haan and Jason Clarke. It is Clarke’s turn as special counsel Roger Rabb, whose ferocious interrogation of
Oppenheimer, accused of being a Communist sympathizer, that is particularly striking. And the best actor you’ve never heard of, Macon Blair, plays Oppenheimer’s legal mentor, Lloyd
Garrison. 
Damon portrays Leslie Groves, Jr., a brigadier general in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and director of the Manhattan
Project where the development of the atomic bomb took place in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There was always the question of whether or not the release of an atomic bomb might actually set the Earth’s
atmosphere on fire, and the scientists were never positive one way or the other. So just before the critical “Trinity”, codename for the test site, Groves looks at Oppenheimer and says “Robert,
please make sure you don’t blow up the world”. Great films often breed memorable lines. 
Speaking of Damon, has he ever given less than an exemplary performance? His incredible turn here as a man politically
opposite to the left-leaning Oppenheimer adds to his career resume. Groves becomes close friends with the physicist about whom Nolan says, “Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important
person who ever lived”. 
e film he is subjected to intense scrutiny from special counsel Robb and others for alleged Communist connections. And Nolan
inserts visual effects of people who suffered severely because of the bombing. Oppenheimer appears to suffer from a sense of overwhelming guilt about the bombing of two major cities in Japan. A brief
visit with President Harry Truman in the Oval Office gives him some respite from that. 
The acting accolades for this movie are endless. The (initially) almost unrecognizable Downey, Jr.’s portrayal of Lewis
Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and Eisenhower cabinet candidate, is what gives politicians or would-be politicos a bad name. His so-called friendship with
Oppenheimer proves to be a big lie. And Downey, Jr. plays the villain to the hilt. 
Some of the actors have smaller roles but Nolan has provided many of them with powerhouse moments. Blunt, for example, turns
up the heat as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty at his secret hearing. For a mere 90 seconds or so her testimony is riveting. And Malek, seen briefly twice before as a minor assistant sans dialogue, is
captivating in his brief defense of Oppenheimer. 
The entire crew is astonishing, and no doubt OPPENHEIMER is headed for multiple award nominations. But for certain it will be
hard to deny the editing of this film led by Jennifer Lame. And the music by composer Ludwig GÖransson is effectively jarring. 
Based on the book ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin,
OPPENHEIMER must be seen on the big screen. At three hours, it could have been trimmed a bit, but moviegoers who pay close attention will be rewarded with one of the most exciting, tense and
important films in recent memory.",POSITIVE

hearing in 1954 conducted in secrecy, which would ultimately strip him of his U.S. government security clearance. 
Recruited by Brigadier General Leslie Groves, Jr. (Matt Damon), director of the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer assembled an
impressive group of elite scientists in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to develop the atomic bomb, a project that was already two years behind the Germans. Physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Niels
Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), the 1922 winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), “father of the hydrogen bomb” and Oppenheimer’s younger brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold), were a few
of the other geniuses selected to participate. And all were present at “Trinity”, the codename for the explosion site, where on July 16, 1945, their work was finally tested. 
But OPPENHEIMER is about so much more than the bomb and all the machinations that went into making it. It turns out that the
accomplished Dr. Oppenheimer was also something of a womanizer. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a Stanford-educated psychiatrist, is a member of the Communist Party of the United States of America and
one of Oppenheimer’s lovers. His wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), who was married to someone else when she met Oppenheimer, is also a gifted biologist who ends up taking a back seat to her husband’s work
and suffers dearly because of it. She doesn’t exactly conform to the norms of mother and wife, but she is devoted to Oppenheimer in her own way. 
And then there is Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), who in 1947 was a founding commissioner of the Atomic Energy
Commission. It is Strauss who prevails upon Oppenheimer to become director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton University, also in 1947. Their precarious relationship was made even more
so when Oppenheimer humiliates Strauss during a Senate hearing. He exacts his revenge upon Oppenheimer, thus causing him to lose that security clearance, ending his role in government and shaping
policy for nuclear power. 
Apparently, when Nolan calls, actors answer and are thrilled to do so. Murphy, who had worked with the director before, but
not in a starring role, jumped at the opportunity to play Oppenheimer --- and he is sublime. His deeply angled face and wide expressive eyes lend themselves to this complicated, astonishing,
fascinating man. It’s a masterful portrayal by Murphy --- seriously riveting. You can’t look away when he’s on screen --- and he’s on screen a lot. He will be a contender for Best Actor come Oscar
season. 
The other two big Oscar possibilities are Downey, Jr. and Blunt. Each is magnetic in their roles. Blunt is effortlessly
quietly dynamic, playing the alcoholic Kitty with honesty and the toughness a wife in her position needs. She’s just so good it’s unnerving. Downey, Jr. is downright spectacular. Strauss’
bitterness --- and pettiness --- is on full display in his portrayal. He’s at once smarmy and yet captivating. During Strauss’ Senate confirmation hearing you can feel --- smell --- his desperation.
Strauss is the role of a lifetime for this highly skilled actor. 
OPPENHEIMER is a major feat for all involved. The editing by Jennifer Lame is incredible, though personally, I think Nolan
could have trimmed at least 20 minutes off the running time of 180 and still maintained the film’s integrity. There are a few scenes in which the story lags and could possibly be detrimental to the
overall reception to OPPENHEIMER. But despite its length, David managed to stay awake. Bravo, David! 
The massive cast is amazing with each member adding to the success of this monumental undertaking. And I would be remiss in
not mentioning the powerful performance by Damon, who never seems to disappoint. But for such an important narrative, things such as production designs, cinematography, costumes and music are
paramount. 
Ruth De Jong is the designer responsible for the jaw-dropping sets and locations. Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema
has worked with Nolan four times, including INTERSTELLAR, TENET and DUNKIRK. The meticulous costumes, including Oppenheimer’s legendary hat, are courtesy of Ellen Mirojnick, her first time working
with Nolan, and the striking score was created by Oscar-winning composer, Ludwig GÖransson,
who also wrote the music for TENET. 
OPPENHEIMER is by far Nolan’s best film to date. It’s an exquisite examination of one man’s determination to save the world
by ending World War II --- and then his self- recrimination for having done so. The brilliance of J. Robert Oppenheimer is eclipsed by the importance of his story. 
David: Well, it was worth the wait. For almost a year at a major
crossroads in LA, writer/director Christopher Nolan teased thousands of motorists every day with a giant billboard counting down exactly when his film OPPENHEIMER would be released. Beginning
September 22, 2022, the huge sign, with a tagline of “The World Forever to Change”, was recording the months, days, hours, minutes and seconds elapsed until July 21, 2023. 
I’m guessing this precursor for his movie about the man who invented the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, had a lot of
people scrambling to Google or Wikipedia to learn what “Oppenheimer” meant. However, after the searing portrayal of the title character by Cillian Murphy, the name Oppenheimer will no longer be a
mystery. In fact, Murphy, in his sixth collaboration with Nolan, has likely established himself as the actor to beat at next year’s Academy Awards. 
An amazing ensemble cast brings this story to life. The actors include Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Matt Damon, Florence
Pugh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Dane De Haan and Jason Clarke. It is Clarke’s turn as special counsel Roger Rabb, whose ferocious interrogation of
Oppenheimer, accused of being a Communist sympathizer, that is particularly striking. And the best actor you’ve never heard of, Macon Blair, plays Oppenheimer’s legal mentor, Lloyd
Garrison. 
Damon portrays Leslie Groves, Jr., a brigadier general in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and director of the Manhattan
Project where the development of the atomic bomb took place in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There was always the question of whether or not the release of an atomic bomb might actually set the Earth’s
atmosphere on fire, and the scientists were never positive one way or the other. So just before the critical “Trinity”, codename for the test site, Groves looks at Oppenheimer and says “Robert,
please make sure you don’t blow up the world”. Great films often breed memorable lines. 
Speaking of Damon, has he ever given less than an exemplary performance? His incredible turn here as a man politically
opposite to the left-leaning Oppenheimer adds to his career resume. Groves becomes close friends with the physicist about whom Nolan says, “Like it or not, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the most important
person who ever lived”. 
e film he is subjected to intense scrutiny from special counsel Robb and others for alleged Communist connections. And Nolan
inserts visual effects of people who suffered severely because of the bombing. Oppenheimer appears to suffer from a sense of overwhelming guilt about the bombing of two major cities in Japan. A brief
visit with President Harry Truman in the Oval Office gives him some respite from that. 
The acting accolades for this movie are endless. The (initially) almost unrecognizable Downey, Jr.’s portrayal of Lewis
Strauss, founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and Eisenhower cabinet candidate, is what gives politicians or would-be politicos a bad name. His so-called friendship with
Oppenheimer proves to be a big lie. And Downey, Jr. plays the villain to the hilt. 
Some of the actors have smaller roles but Nolan has provided many of them with powerhouse moments. Blunt, for example, turns
up the heat as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty at his secret hearing. For a mere 90 seconds or so her testimony is riveting. And Malek, seen briefly twice before as a minor assistant sans dialogue, is
captivating in his brief defense of Oppenheimer. 
The entire crew is astonishing, and no doubt OPPENHEIMER is headed for multiple award nominations. But for certain it will be
hard to deny the editing of this film led by Jennifer Lame. And the music by composer Ludwig GÖransson is effectively jarring. 
Based on the book ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin,
OPPENHEIMER must be seen on the big screen. At three hours, it could have been trimmed a bit, but moviegoers who pay close attention will be rewarded with one of the most exciting, tense and
important films in recent memory.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," “Brilliance makes up for a lot,” reasons the title character early in Oppenheimer, an indulgent yet invigorating true-life thriller that proves its subject’s theory both right and wrong. This longtime passion project from director Christopher Nolan is a stirring biopic about the man credited with creating the atomic bomb that puts the inherent moral complexities of his story front and center. While it offers the requisite deep-dive into the life and career of famed physicist Dr. Robert Oppenheimer, the film excels at providing context to his legacy, and examining the enduring (if dubious) relevance of his accomplishments. After all, his work in overseeing development of the world’s preeminent weapon of mass destruction influenced the Cold War, the nuclear arms race, and ongoing global power struggles. But Nolan persuasively argues that behind the scenes, he was a misunderstood genius who became a scapegoat during a time of intense sociopolitical turmoil. The film traces the soft-spoken Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as he’s tabbed to teach at Princeton during the late 1940s, during a time of postwar unease, especially in the Pacific. He gained a following for his lectures but also ruffled feathers by advocating for social causes. Known for his broad scientific expertise, he’s recruited by shifty bureaucrat Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) to lead the Manhattan Project, a top-secret effort involving the world’s leading scientists under the direction of Army officer Leslie Groves (Matt Damon). They gathered at the makeshift New Mexico town of Los Alamos to develop an atomic bomb, without strategic knowledge of its eventual deployment. Behind the scenes, Oppenheimer was dogged by accusations of Communist involvement, partially because of his tough-minded wife (Emily Blunt), who remained loyal despite his affair with an ex-girlfriend (Florence Pugh). Although its nonlinear structure can be frustrating, Nolan’s dense screenplay is insightful. The talky exposition of the first hour gives way to an escalating undercurrent of ticking-clock suspense that seems fitting for a movie about explosives. The sequence involving the bomb test at Los Alamos is riveting in its buildup and aftermath. Meanwhile, a thoughtfully understated performance by Murphy (The Dark Knight) digs beneath Oppenheimer’s speech and mannerisms to probe his intellect, ego, ambition, and vulnerability in equal measure. The excellent supporting ensemble features Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, Matthew Modine, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, and Gary Oldman. Shot by ace cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (Dunkirk), the film is sharply crafted and technically polished, toggling between visual styles with a meticulous eye for period detail. Nolan draws parallels between Oppenheimer and mythological fire god Prometheus — two men whose noble intentions yielded tragic consequences. In raising the emotional stakes, the film provides more than just a valuable history lesson.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Now playing in theaters nationwide. Cinemark Dallas XD & IMAX on Webb Chapel Rd. is one of two theaters in Texas playing the film in IMAX 70mm, which expands images up to a 1.43:1 aspect ratio – arguably the best possible experience. Critic’s note: The Dallas-area film critics’ screening was presented in (non-IMAX) 70mm at AMC NorthPark 15 earlier this week. Technical difficulties arose before showtime, which led to a 45-minute delay. Even after the film got the go-ahead to proceed, the picture presentation at this particular theater was misaligned, with the projector frequently falling out of focus and confusing viewers on whether or not what they were seeing was an artistic choice. Normally, I wouldn’t think these details would be essential to share; however, other theaters (including a critics' screening in Los Angeles) have experienced similar challenges. Hopefully, these kinks have been ironed out should you choose to experience the film in 35mm or 70mm projection (as director Christopher Nolan would recommend). Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, 'Oppenheimer' is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it.  Review: There’s no denying how much of an event Christopher Nolan’s films are, especially this time around with the looming box office war between Oppenheimer and Barbie offering endless social media fodder. Another fun aspect is how Nolan recreated a nuclear detonation without the use of computer-generated images. In fact, the entire film features little to no CGI.  The cinematic experience is very important to Nolan, and his dedication often leads to profound, memorable and chin-stroking works. His latest, Oppenheimer, hits all three word descriptions. It’s like imagining the likes of JFK and The Social Network fused with the filmmaking style of Terrence Malick.  Nolan finds the intensity and beauty in every moment, crafting a grand exploration of “don’t mess with scientists” and respect (even when people wildly disagree with one another). While Oppenheimer hardly offers any breathing room, with scenes hurtling from one to the next, the film assembles a series of fascinating scientific lectures and sit-downs propelled by award-worthy performances and anchored by incredible themes of human decency and destruction.  Based on Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biographical novel American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, this three-hour epic centers on the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (a top form Cillian Murphy), the so-called father of the atomic bomb. Largely told from Oppenheimer’s perspective, we follow the physicist as he works alongside a team of government scientists (including Josh Hartnett, Alex Wolff and Uncut Gems co-director Ben Safdie) to develop nuclear weapons in the early 1940s.  The other perspective, filmed in black-and-white, is Admiral Lewis Strauss (an unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr.), a former businessman and chair of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, who plays a significant role in Oppenheimer’s life after World War II. The film crosscuts Oppenheimer’s 1954 security-clearance hearing and Strauss’s 1959 Senate confirmation hearing to become President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s Secretary of Commerce.  Obviously, this sounds like a lot to keep up with, and it is. To some, Oppenheimer will register as a remarkable chapter in history explored at its most artful rendering. Nolan doesn’t shape this as your typical true-story movie, starting from point A and ending at Z. Instead, we jump from point X to C and N to F. It’s a certain rhythm comparable to the middle section of Danny Boyle’s Steve Jobs, where the film interweaves two arguments from different points in time with the same characters. This framing device and ongoing flow allow Nolan to capture more ground in the story without losing validity. Other filmmakers might combine different moments in time into one sequence. It may be a jarring structure at first, feeling like one really long trailer, but it soon casualizes and invites the viewer to gather many surprising elements. 'Oppenheimer' is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black-and-white analogue photography. Pictured: Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Trinity test explosion.  One such element is how well Nolan puts us inside the headspace of Oppenheimer. A moment of triumph can quickly descend into doom. Take, for instance, the film’s centerpiece: the Trinity test explosion, the first time in world history that a nuclear weapon was detonated. The calculations and planning leading up to the detonation pull you into the vacuum of curiosity and passion among its team members, primarily Oppenheimer. On the other side of what they’ve accomplished, and what historical and tragic events follow it, is damn near a horror movie, showing haunting images and warped camera effects that capture Oppenheimer’s disorientation of being the architect of something that changed the world forever. It’s riveting to watch it all unfold. What makes it truly riveting is Murphy’s nuanced performance paired with all the other incredible performances peppered throughout. Murphy’s piercing blue eyes and how he carries himself and takes in his surroundings amount to something that should be decorated in gold. (Remember the scene in 2007’s Sunshine when he also looked at an explosion, and his eyes told you everything you needed to know.) The same could be said of Downey Jr., who looks and sounds like nothing we’ve ever seen him in before. What’s stunning is Downey Jr. doesn’t have much screen time, yet his performance will be one of the first things you’ll think of when it comes to ever discussing the film.  One should also mention Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife, Katherine, another role with little screen time. Blunt has two scenes that deliver significant blows of dramatic power. Honestly, one could keep rattling off the talents who make splashes – such as Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence, a nuclear physicist who in 1939 won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his invention of the cyclotron, and Matt Damon as Lt. Gen Leslie Groves, another critical figure in the Manhattan Project (who gets the film’s most quotable lines). L to R: Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, and Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer. To get more on the technical side, there’s Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography work and Ludwig Göransson’s musical score. Hoytema, who Nolan has worked with since 2014’s Interstellar, deeply captures the psychological space of his characters. There are times when the camera will elect not to be the star, turning the lens away from what would arguably be the more visual moment (such as the Trinity test) to instead focus on Oppenheimer’s reaction, which feels more grand than any explosion could be. Hoytema also makes settings without much movement (like the boardroom and courtroom sequences) have an intoxicating allure. He’ll often guide your eyes where to look through his pull-focus and will give other shots plenty of room to admire the frame’s contents. Compared to Nolan’s other musical scores, Göransson’s work is reeled in to not overpower the words. (Nolan’s films are often criticized for their sound mixing, with the music drowning out the dialogue.) Don’t expect too much of the usual intensity of heavy strings, distortion and ticking-clock sounds (mostly in the last hour). It gets more romantic and poetic during the sequences involving science (listen to the tracks “Quantum Mechanics” and “Gravity Swallows Light”). Then there’s tracks like “Groves” which capture the feeling of what it would be like to drift through the cosmos with all the wonder of the universe. It’s quite beautiful. Oppenheimer is a film that demands your attention. It’s far from being anything remotely close to a “laundry folding” film. Complex words and ideas hit like a firehose and could be too overwhelming for some. Whether or not its narrative style connects with you, one thing is certain: it’ll send you on a historical research hunt and may persuade you to read its source material in the same way superhero movie fans chase theory pieces and comics to discover all details within.

"Jul 21, 2023"," It should come as no surprise that when faced with telling the complex story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, that writer/director Christopher Nolan would take a radical approach. Initially jarring and off-putting, the fragmented nature and speed with which this story is told takes time to adjust to and, in fact, is not completely successful. Yet, there’s no denying this is a compelling, fascinating piece of work that attempts to see the world as its titular character did, as one in which fusion and fission not only dominated his work but his personal life as well, with tragic results. Nolan uses dueling flashbacks to drive this exceptional biopic, the memories of Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as well as those of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), two rivals whose paths cross at key times in the development of the United States’ nuclear policy. The opening act is dominated by Oppenheimer’s memories, presented in quick flashes, as if we are privy to the random nature of his mind. There are brief scenes of him studying in Cambridge in 1925, then a quick cut of his being grilled by the Personal Security Board in 1954, only to be followed by a scene in which he is seen conducting research at Caltech in 1928, which gives way to a sequence in which he attends a meeting of socialists where he meets activist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) who would become his lover. Yes, biopics by their nature dictate a compression of real-life events and Nolan’s presenting them to reflect Oppenheimer’s thought processes is intriguing.  However, it isn’t conducive to character development or, at times, narrative cohesion.  Neither Tatlock nor the scientist’s wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) are fully developed, the former seen as simply troubled, the later a harpy, while the events in Oppenheimer’s life through the 1920s and 1930s are covered in such a piecemeal, rapid fashion that it comes off as a Cliffs Notes version of these events. Then again, Nolan may have shot many more scenes covering this period that had to be excised. Of course, this all may be done by design. Do the less than complete portraits of the two women reflect how important they were to Oppenheimer?  Does the speed with which the early part of his career is covered suggest the irresistible nature of fate that was compelling him towards the moment that would define his life? A second viewing will provide clarity for these and other matters. Without question, the sequences involving the creation of the Manhattan Project and the bombs they would produce are fascinating and compelling. Driven by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Nolan presents each breakthrough the scientists make with as much excitement as dread, all of it building towards the climactic moment of the first test of the device. This sequence is filmmaking of the highest quality, the significance of this momentous event underscored not so much by the bomb’s fury but the reaction of its creators. Appearing in nearly each scene, Murphy carries the emotional burden of this story on his shoulders with his complex, subtle and ultimately moving performance. It’s a remarkable turn as the actor captures the optimism of the young scientist and the regret of the older man, whose guilt compelled him to take the unpopular stance of calling for international arms control at the height of the Cold War. The actor is captivating throughout, as is Downey Jr., reminding us he’s capable of much more than occupying a tin suit. A remarkable, complex achievement, Nolan’s film is a timely reminder of the hubris we are all prone to and the peril that comes from short-sighted bureaucracies overseeing scientific endeavors. “Oppenheimer” is a cautionary tale writ large, one whose lessons the director knows full well we are doomed to ignore again and again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," There comes a point in Oppenheimer where audiences may just wonder: is there a single white male actor working in Hollywood that isn’t in this movie?! It’s a testament to writer/director Christopher Nolan’s reputation that he’s able to pull in such a deep bench catalogue of actors for his latest cinematic opus. Oppenheimer is an incredibly ambitious three hour ode to J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the man who led the Manhattan project in the creation of the Atomic bomb. Nolan frames the narrative using two different hearings: a Communist witch hunt masquerading as a security clearance hearing presided over by Gordon Gray (Tony Goldwyn) and Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) and a US Cabinet confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), former head of the Atomic Energy Commission. The former is presented in colour, while the latter is in black and white (presumably to aid audiences in distinguishing the timelines). In between is the somewhat-linear chronological tale of how Oppenheimer began his career as a physicist, dabbled in joining the Communist party thanks to associations with his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) and lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), before eventually getting assigned to Los Alamos where he oversaw the development of the A-bomb. Oppenheimer is wildly ambitious in its scope and unapologetic about its pacing. Characters flit in and out of the story and the editing, particularly in the first act, is speedy. This gives the story a sense of urgency, although some audiences may struggle to keep track of the myriad number of characters and comprehend the hysteria about anti-communist sentiment that drives much of the narrative.  It’s clear early on that Oppenheimer is a genius – he picks up languages quickly, he’s fond of debate, and he ingratiates himself in a crowd with relative ease. One of the main thrusts of the narrative is exploring not just how he steered the creation of A-bomb, but also how he (does and does not) negotiate the personalities and the politics involved in the project. The other overarching theme is the responsibility Oppie bears for changing the course of history. The narrative assumes that the historical outcome of his work (ie: the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki) is widely known, so Oppenheimer uses that as shorthand to examine how the Atomic bomb contributed significantly to the escalation of the arms race. Initially the project’s goal is to beat the Nazis to the punch and end WWII, but when Hitler is defeated that shifts to securing Japan’s surrender. It is only after bombing the two Japanese cities that Oppenheimer truly realizes what they’ve begun is a never-ending race to build a bigger, more destructive weapon. This is where the last act of the film focuses its time and energy, with the micro-level petty personal conflict between Oppenheimer and Strauss mirroring the macro-level implications of mutually-assured destruction on a global scale (hence the plot device of the two hearings). It works to a certain degree because Nolan is so incredibly proficient at dramatizing the back room politics and generating audience sympathy for Oppenheimer, whose fall from grace occurs almost as soon as the US government no longer needs his help to win the war. Alas, while the story is obviously designed to build to the outcome of both Strauss’ confirmation and Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing, Oppenheimer‘s true climax is its much-publicized recreation of the Atomic bomb test at Los Alamos. It’s such an exciting sequence that the film doesn’t fully recover its sense of pacing and wonderment; small, closed-room meetings where men yell and confront each other simply can’t compete with the visual wonder of the epic explosion. There is also something ironic about how Nolan idolizes his subject considering how much of the story is about the hubris of man (the film literally opens with a quote about Prometheus stealing fire from the gods). Criticisms about the writer/director’s tendency to focus on male-driven stories and his inability to write three-dimensional female characters also won’t be challenged by the film; Pugh spends the majority of her brief screen time topless or throwing out flowers, while Emily Blunt (as Oppie’s wife Kitty) mostly just drinks until she gets a few explosive scenes near the film’s end. Many of the main performances are very strong, especially Murphy, RDJ, and Matt Damon (as Oppenheimer’s military handler and friend, General Groves). The rest of the cast barely gets enough to do to stand out, though the litany of actors Nolan recruited is impressive (between this and Barbie, it’s the summer of massive casts).",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," When a film’s marketing features a tagline as powerful as “The world forever changes,” you’ve got to have the goods to back up just why the focus of this piece of cinema is so monumentally historic. Then again, the release of a new film from auteur filmmaker Christopher Nolan is always fairly monumental in itself. For the last decade, Nolan has been intent on producing epics of sound and sight purposely designed for the largest cinemas possible. And now he’s tackling a moment in history that truly did change the world; the invention of the atomic bomb and the infamous man responsible for its creation. Both an intensely intimate character study and a glorious theatrical experience, Oppenheimer is a staggering piece of filmmaking only someone like Nolan could bring to fruition. Led with quiet power by a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy and elevated by a sublime ensemble supporting cast, it’s a profoundly human portrait of a brilliant man and the crushing weight of moral reckoning. A beautifully crafted and palpably tense thriller centred on ambition, hubris, paranoia, and persecution, it’s an overwhelming piece of cinema and one of the year’s finest films. In a tiny Washington D.C. boardroom in 1954 sits J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy, never better), the genius theoretical physicist responsible for the research and development of the world’s first nuclear. Once heralded a national hero for his role in effectively ending World War II, Oppenheimer is now before a board of influential men who will decide if his national security clearance should be revoked over rumours of his communist ties and disloyalty to the United States. In a plush office outside the U.S. Senate in 1959 sits Lewis Strauss (a magnificent Robert Downey Jr.), the former chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and a key figure in the development of nuclear weapons. After being nominated by President Eisenhower to become the next U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Strauss is now before a congressional hearing to confirm his nomination, proving more heated and controversial than he naively imagined. Over the course of three hours, Nolan will jump between these two proceedings to highlight how these men’s lives intersected and why both hearings will have unspeakable consequences on their image and reputation. As a much younger man, we meet Oppenheimer as a promising but troubled student who’s plagued by visions of flames, sparks, and atoms. After spending time in Europe developing his interest in “radical physics,” Oppenheimer returns to the U.S. to pass on his teachings as a professor at Berkley. While Oppenheimer is beginning to implement his research into the newly-discovered concept of splitting atoms, Hitler invades Poland and the physicist is promptly recruited by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to lead the Los Alamos Laboratory and its Manhattan Project, which will eventually lead to the creation of the world’s first atomic bomb. But when the bomb is used to annihilate tens of thousands of people in Japan, Oppenheimer becomes a vocal advocate against further nuclear development, placing a target squarely on his back as a dissenting citizen. Whether you’re well versed in the life and times of Oppenheimer or this is your first introduction to the notorious figure of American history, this is an utterly enthralling tale where 180 minutes of time truly fly by without even noticing. At its core, Oppenheimer is a beautifully crafted and staggeringly human character piece in the same vein as Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List and Oliver Stone’s JFK. By focusing so tightly and intensely on one particular character, Nolan digs deep into the psyche of his protagonist to offer something so much more than just a historical drama or a generic Wikipedia-style biopic. Oppenheimer is a complicated and complex figure and Nolan deftly toes the line between deifying and indicting him. His screenplay is just as interested in celebrating his genius as it is in exploring his faults and vulnerabilities. He’s charismatic and charming, but also conceited and naive. There’s something so equally fascinating and frustrating about this man, making him the perfect subject matter for such a grand opus of a film. In the hands of a lesser filmmaker, this tale could have fallen into the trap of being a bombastic war movie or an action blockbuster that fails to acknowledge the humanity of its subject. Nolan wisely refuses even to reimagine the horrific events in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Instead, we see it through Oppenheimer’s terrifying visions of what he presumes occurred, juxtaposed with the cheering of crowds as he’s celebrated as an icon of American patriotism. That’s not to suggest there aren’t epic theatrical elements at play here. The sequence involving the Trinity Test where Oppenheimer’s bomb is first trialled is one of the most stunningly staged sequences you’ll see on screen this year. Or any year, for that matter. Try not to hold your breath as the clock counts down and dozens of men bear witness to the glory and horror of what Oppenheimer has invented. Aided by razor-sharp editing by Jennifer Lame, a thunderous horn and string-heavy score from Ludwig Göransson, ingenious sound design (or, in some moments, lack thereof), and visual effects somehow completely devoid of CGI trickery, it’s a pulse-pounding moment bound for the annals of movie-making history. At the centre of everything (don’t quote me on this, but I believe he’s in almost every single scene of this film) is Murphy with the role of a lifetime and perhaps his greatest performance to date. Murphy brings a raw, quiet power to every single frame as he expertly captures the intricacies, complexities, and contradictions of a man on the precipice of greatness and later torn apart by his actions. It’s a sublimely compelling turn where so much is conveyed on Oppenheimer’s face, often captured in tight close-ups by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema where you can genuinely feel the conflicting emotions pulsating in this man’s brain. You cannot take your eyes off Murphy and he surely has to be looking at his first (and overdue) Oscar nomination. Downey Jr is equally as impressive in a role that breaks off the shackles of those superhero movies he’s been stuck in for the past decade. It’s best to leave the specifics of Strauss’ character arc for you to discover on your own, but Downey Jr is sensational as a man caught between awe and jealousy and fuelled by his own infallible hubris. Strauss is a cunning strategist whose manipulation of Oppenheimer is both mesmerising and horrifying. Nolan is blessed with an embarrassment of riches in an ensemble cast that includes Oscar winners Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, and Gary Oldman in small but wildly memorable roles, particularly the latter as the no-nonsense, acerbic President Truman. If there is one slight fault to highlight, it’s the continued struggle of Nolan to write fully-dimensional female characters. Oppenheimer was reportedly a wild womaniser; something Nolan doesn’t shy away from. His dismissal and almost ignorance of his frustratingly faithful wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt) is hard to watch, but it’s even harder to watch someone as talented as Blunt be saddled with a role that fails her so repeatedly. She’s blessed with a rousing moment late in the film, but there’s a noticeable lack of depth to a woman who clearly had her reasons for remaining by her husband’s side. It’s even more egregious to hire someone as brilliant as Florence Pugh in the role of Oppenheimer’s mentally ill mistress Jean Tatlock. Pugh naturally elevates her brief scenes, but it’s a thankless role beneath her skills. It’s a minor quibble in a film that’s a near masterpiece of cinema. This is Nolan at his best and most effective. He innately understands the immense power of storytelling and this is a story that demanded to be told in such a soaring way. The tension he’s able to build. The emotions he’s able to capture. The performances he manages to elicit. The imagery he’s able to craft. The non-linear structure he’s able to build. Everything here works so stunningly well. Haunting, captivating, and unforgettable, Oppenheimer is a film that will stay with you for an eternity.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," AT ONE POINT NEAR THE END of American Prometheus—the 2005 biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin detailing the physicist’s effort to create the atomic bomb and the effort of his political enemies to tar him as a Communist after the fact, and the book on which the film Oppenheimer is based—the authors highlight Oppie’s annoyance with a popular play that closed with a monologue announcing his feelings of guilt about the creation, and deployment, of the atomic bomb. “Such melodrama somehow cheapened the character of his ordeal,” Kai and Sherwin write. “In short, he thought the script poor drama precisely because it lacked ambiguity.” I have no idea what Oppenheimer would make of Oppenheimer, but it is decidedly ambiguous in its treatment of two of the great moral quandaries of midcentury America: the development and deployment of the atomic bomb, and the maniacal effort to root out Communist infiltration (or “infiltration”) of America’s political, social, and educational classes. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) himself rests at the intersection of these two tempests, and it is through him that this storm will rage. Oppenheimer is framed through two hearings. The first, in color, follows Oppie as he tries to maintain his atomic secrets security clearance in the face of accusations that his relationships—professional, social, and sexual—with Communists and support for liberal (and Communist-backed) causes represents a risk to national security, one that may or may not have led to the Soviet Union acquiring nuclear weapons of their own. As part of this hearing, Oppenheimer tells his life story, which we see in flashback. The second hearing, in black and white, concerns Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as he hopes to be confirmed by the Senate for a role in Dwight Eisenhower’s cabinet. The matter of Oppenheimer’s persecution plays a central role in the debate; through a series of flashbacks, we see the role Strauss himself played in that farce, and the role his own insecurities played in trying to destroy the reputation of the father of the atomic bomb. Some have compared Oppenheimer to JFK, in large part thanks to the rhythmic nature of the editing, but thematically it calls to mind Amadeus and the ways in which petty inferiors obsessed with slights real and imagined used public opinion and the levers of power to destroy their betters. THE TIMELINES DISCUSSED in the hearings occasionally intersect, but Nolan layers the chronological structure in such a way that it’s never confusing, each element amplifying or echoing the other in precise ways to keep the story—the meat of which is the flashback, Oppie’s life story as told by Oppie in his own hearing—moving. For a movie that’s three hours long, occasionally in black and white, and features almost nothing but dudes chatting about science stuff, Oppenheimer absolutely zips along, moving us through his college years and early professional life with ease before we get to the heart of the matter: the development of Los Alamos and the creation of the atomic bomb. It helps that Nolan has assembled one of the greatest supporting casts of all time to deliver all of this intercutting dialogue; Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr. both deserve awards-season consideration, but every single role is stocked with top-tier talent. A special kudos to Macon Blair, who perfectly portrays confused frustration as Oppenheimer’s put-upon lawyer, Lloyd Garrison, in Oppie’s Kafkaesque security hearing. Nolan, who wrote the screenplay in addition to directing the picture, does an admirable job of conveying both the urgency and necessity of the creation of the atomic bomb alongside the discomfort some of the scientists felt at the thought of creating a single bomb capable of killing thousands at a go. At the end of the day, however, Oppenheimer is less concerned with parsing the moral difference between the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the fire bombings of Tokyo and Dresden (for good reason, since there is none), and more concerned with consequences of humanity’s unfortunate discovery of the ability to destroy itself. The fission bomb leads inexorably to the fusion bomb—the “super,” as Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), one of the scientists dead-set on creating a hydrogen bomb, calls it—and the fusion bomb has no battlefield benefit, unlike the tactical nukes Oppenheimer spent his later years arguing in favor of. The H-bomb is a weapon of pure destruction, pure terror: a promise that great power conflict will quickly devolve into world-destroying conflict. This destruction, mutually assured, may stave off conflict, but for someone who sees the world through a quantum lens, the very possibility of that destruction is nearly too much to bear. Oppenheimer, at times of great stress, sees the world as living and destroyed simultaneously. One might think of him as seeing the world in a constant state of Schrödinger’s Annihilation. The strain is evident on Murphy’s face as he delivers the greatest performance of his career. IT IS HARD NOT TO THINK OF Nolan’s Dunkirk and Oppenheimer as two parts of a midcentury epic. The first marked the decline of one empire managed by an exhausted elite; the second chronicles the rise of another, this one managed by mediocrities who relied on scientific elites to give them the power to end all life on Earth. Oppenheimer mimics Dunkirk’s stylistic designation of the timelines—the color section is labeled “1. Fission” and the black and white “2. Fusion,” a clear echo of Dunkirk’s delineation of 1. The Mole, 2. The Sea, and 3. The Air—and the two are clearly in conversation with each other. Dunkirk’s closing lines involve Tommy (Fionn Whitehead) reading Churchill’s speech: “And even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island . . . were subjugated and starving. . . . Then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle. Until, in God’s good time, the New World, with all its power and might steps forth to the rescue and liberation of the old.” In the script for Dunkirk, that sequence fades to black on Tom Hardy’s burning Spitfire. In the film, however, there’s one last cut: back to Tommy, who looks up from his newspaper and not quite into the camera—and thus, not at us, the present-day viewer—but just off of it. As if he’s caught a vision of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s gaunt face reflected in his train’s window. He is, after all, the man who will truly marshal all of the New World’s power and might. And he is the man who will be crucified for trying to contain the atomic fire stolen from Olympus before it can consume the New World—and the Old.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Early on in Oppenheimer, the title character (Cillian Murphy) poisons an apple after a professor humiliates him in class. He remembers the poisoned apple the next morning, and rushes back to the classroom, praying that the teacher has not eaten it yet. This time, J. Robert Oppenheimer is able to put the genie back in the bottle. Crisis and its aftereffects are averted. While later efforts to contain the nuclear arms race will not be, this also tells us something about the man. He can be petty, vindictive, and capable of lashing out, but above all, wants to remain kind of aloof. One of the central concerns of Oppenheimer is trying to suss out what exactly is going on in the mind of its main character.  There are many sides to Oppenheimer. Sometimes it feels as though he experiences the world by studying it, learning Dutch or Sanskrit or reading Marx in German because he is searching for something that will explain the world to him. Physics, of course, is fundamentally the search for understanding how the universe works (the physicists I’ve known have said that all science is just applied physics; they also tend to come with egos as vast as their chosen field). Furthermore, the script reminds the audience that alongside Einstein and other scientific revolutions, the tide of change is rising in the early 20th century, as the rise of communism, fascism, and social change are emerging as well. We learn what Oppenheimer has at least considered, and some of his personal values, but often we are shown Murphy’s steel blue eyes and left to ponder what his specific opinions are on any given subject. There are only a few certainties to Oppenheimer–perhaps his affinity for quantum physics was simply his innate desire to hold two opposing thoughts in his head at once–his guilt over the use of the atomic bomb, his belief that the Nazis must be defeated at all costs, and his belief in science/scientists. But when it comes to building the hydrogen bomb, and his personal and political relationships, Oppenheimer remains enigmatic. And yet Oppenheimer is a deeply emotional work. The importance of Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and her impact on Oppenheimer echo forward to his later feelings of guilt over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This generates some of the most impactful cinema of Nolan’s career, standing alongside parts of Interstellar, another intellectually-driven man rendered to a near catatonic state due to his inability to process emotions the way he can scientific concepts. There is a moment where Nolan finally escapes the terminal velocity of the material world and lands in a surreal space between the mind and the world outside. For all of the filmmaker’s precision and love of capturing “reality,” this moment is more transcendent than the Trinity test sequence.  Oppenheimer’s relationship with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt) and his brother (Dylan Arnold) also come with their own fraught moments. One recurring theme is Oppenheimer’s ethnicity, with Isidor Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz) bringing up Jewishness as a driving force behind the need to defeat the Nazis. While Oppenheimer identifies as Jewish on an ethnic level, we never see any religious practice at all. While this three hour movie still doesn’t have room for everything, it feels more like lip service than something fully reckoned with by Nolan.  The relationship between science and politics–both personal and policy–is the focus of the film’s final third. Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), the third chair of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), plays a key role in this dynamic in the postwar era. The urgency and stakes of building the atomic bomb were too important for General Groves (Matt Damon) to play too strong of a hand during the war, but when America has to decide what to do about nuclear power–enriched uranium, further testing sites, power plants, responses to the Soviets–politics must come into play. Nolan seems to be unsure whether Oppenheimer was a savvy political navigator or more of a clear-eyed believer, an optimist who actually believed that nuclear weapons could lead to lasting peace.  Oppenheimer is a very talky movie. Most of its scenes involve white men sitting in rooms talking about physics, engineering, warmaking, or political policy. Yet, many of those scenes are as thrilling or fraught as any involving nuclear material. There is an immediacy and urgency in almost every scene, as the stakes have never been higher up to that point in history. In addition, one of Nolan’s major strengths as a storyteller, the way the information is delivered to the viewer, is in full force. The density and nonlinear approach with which it is told allows for effective callbacks, repetition, and severely delayed resolution. One or two of them in particular do feel like your mind is splitting atoms, with how note-perfect the reveals are. The end result feels so effortless and organic that viewing Oppenheimer makes you feel like an instant expert on nuclear policy. By the time the political maneuvering is happening, everything seems twisted around and perverted by the shadow of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but the Cold War must be reckoned with as well. How many world-ending devices does one country need? We’re all MAD (mutually assured destruction) here. Like much of Nolan’s work, Oppenheimer is a study in causality. This is the first time the writer-director has taken on a biopic, but the approach is the same as his previous films. What caused the bomb to be invented, and what was the effect? Was fighting fascism in Spain the reason Oppenheimer was a communist sympathizer, or what it the result? Some of the causes are unknowable. Did Oppenheimer turn Einstein against Strauss? What was the cause of Oppenheimer humiliating Strauss at a previous hearing? We don’t know, but we certainly see the effect.  Based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, and Prometheus–who stole fire from Olympus and gave it to humans–is another core theme of the film. Also analogous is the apple in Eden–the apple that the serpent promises Eve will open her eyes and grant her knowledge of good and evil–once obtained this knowledge can not be unknown. Both Prometheus and Eve were punished for unleashing this knowledge on the world. Was Oppenheimer? Did he know the only way to unlock the practicality of physics was to inject the poison of war into that apple of knowledge?  It's eerie reading, because they're wrangling with this thing they've unleashed. How's that going to be controlled? It's just this most monstrous responsibility. Once that knowledge is out there in the world, what can you do? You can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. It was a savvy, thoughtful wrap gift, actually, because, like you, I've grown up in the postnuclear age. In Graham Swift's Waterland, there's a whole section about apocalyptic thinking. We've grown up in the shadow of the ultimate destructive knowledge. Oppenheimer himself could be the prime mover of Nolan’s universe, the inventor of the modern world. When light can be both a wave and a particle, what chance does the truth have? Nolan of course structures the film as ping ponging back and forth across time, with Oppenheimer’s perspective being the major unifying force, but is also knowable. Oppenheimer is known and unknown. Two opposite yet observable truths.  The use of the atomic bomb is something all Americans must internalize about our place in the world. America is the only power to ever detonate such a device in an act of war. This is in addition to the ecological and biological harm caused by testing nuclear weapons, a responsibility we must also bear. Our accountability carries forward in time beyond those who actually made the decisions. Like many of America’s other atrocities, it is continually swept aside or framed only in the most nationalistic of terms. Those displaced by Los Alamos, those impacted by the underestimate around radioactive fallout, and those killed or poisoned by the attacks on Japan are the unseen victims of the story. Bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki with atomic weapons were crimes against humanity, and against nature. We don’t see them here, but the guilt that haunts Oppenheimer is vividly depicted, and should be the guilt that haunts us all. You can’t unpoison an apple. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," The strength and sinew of “Oppenheimer” (⭐ ⭐ ⭐ 1/2, in theaters) starts with the actor playing the title role: Cillian Murphy is exactly the man you want at the center of an explosion. By “explosion,” of course, I mean the atomic bomb developed by J. Robert Oppenheimer’s Manhattan Project during World War II, but I also mean Christopher Nolan’s film about the building of the bomb. “Oppenheimer” is a movie that detonates with methodical force in several directions at once. It’s a story about a man trying to hammer the elements — the very atoms — into something terrifyingly powerful, a gift and a curse for mankind. But it’s also about an ambitious filmmaker marshaling his resources to give that story the weight and majesty it deserves. Murphy, an avatar of intense blue-eyed stillness, is the hub for the centrifuge, the cipher around which Nolan and his creative team set everything awhirl: History, politics, physics, ethics, the techniques of narrative cinema. A cast large enough to disappear over the horizon and, beyond that horizon, the ghosts of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – 129,000 to 226,000 men, women, and children violently destroyed by what Oppenheimer wrought. Nolan has set out to make a moral epic, and he succeeds for the most part, or, rather, for the first two thirds of “Oppenheimer,” which contains some of the finest, most galvanizing moviemaking of his career. I’ve never quite bought into the breathless acceptance of this director as the Kubrick of his generation (in part because I’ve always had reservations about Kubrick as the Kubrick of his generation), and Nolan’s seriousness of purpose and meticulous craftsmanship have often risked stifling the spark of life, the chaos principle, that can animate great art. But here, even more than in “Dunkirk,” he has a subject to match his canvas: The effort by which a bickering army of international scientists met in the desert to create “a weapon to end all wars” – that was the hope, anyway – under the eyes of the U.S. Army and one mercurial, womanizing genius. Confidently entwining several overlapping timelines, filming in color and lustrous black and white, and parceling his narrative into two baskets labeled “Fusion” (the coming together of the Manhattan Project) and “Fission” (the splitting apart of the group’s loyalties during the McCarthy Era), Nolan masterfully tacks between the micro of Oppenheimer’s personal life and the macro of global conflict. Oppenheimer was a New Yorker who fell in love early on with the landscape of New Mexico; who came of age as a brilliant young Jewish physicist in a Europe where post-Great War antisemitism was gathering steam. He was at the cutting edge of quantum theory in Germany and  brought it back to America, where he taught at Berkeley and made the connections that positioned him as a Big Mind to lead other Big Minds after US intelligence learned the Nazis were working on a megabomb and decided to get there first. (There’s an excellent 1981 documentary playing on the Criterion Channel until the end of the month – “The Day After Trinity; J. Robert Oppenheimer & The Atomic Bomb” – should you want to brush up on the subject.) Oppenheimer mixed with Socialists and American Communists in the inter-war period without fully committing to the Party, and that position – half principle and half cussedness – made him a security risk during the war and a convenient target afterwards. Nolan and Murphy portray the man as less interested in politics and more charged by what could be done in the vast inner spaces that quantum theory had discovered. To that end and under his Army overseer Major Gen. Leslie Groves (a bluff Matt Damon), Oppenheimer suggests building an entire town out in his beloved New Mexico and peopling it with his scientific peers. The race is on, Oppenheimer’s government minders mistrusting him on one side – Casey Affleck and Dane DeHaan are each uniquely chilling as two of the doubters/tormentors – and, on the other, the physicists passionately debating the morality of what they’re doing. This is where  Murphy’s natural sang-froid proves most valuable: In Nolan’s version of the tale, Oppenheimer is not so much a peacemaker but an enigmatic, unstoppable engine of discovery. He’ll put up with the Army’s paranoia and the fractiousness of his fellow scientists as long as it takes, because he’s driven by the desire to see what will happen. As the many dancing parts of “Oppenheimer” work toward the climax of the Trinity Test – the first exploding of an atomic weapon at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945 – Nolan builds the suspense with all the techniques at his disposal. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s fluid camerawork seems to be everywhere at once and Ludwig Göransson’s score walks right up to and sometimes over the line of overkill, dragging us along with it. When the detonation comes, though, the film falls silent, as is fitting for a breaking point in human history. The only movement aside from the angry mushroom cloud on the horizon is the silhouetted figure of J. Robert Oppenheimer looking at – finally seeing – what he has done. And after that? Everything goes to pieces, including to some degree the movie itself. Nolan is wise not to dramatize the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; instead, he lets its horrors seep into the mind and imagination of Oppenheimer as the Los Alamos scientists celebrate. Up to this point, the film has been dramatizing the wartime Manhattan Project alongside two hearings in the post-WWII era, one a secret panel of hostile Congressmen charged with renewing Oppenheimer’s security clearance in 1954 and the other the 1958 confirmation hearings for Commerce Secretary nominee Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), Oppenheimer’s former boss at the Atomic Energy Commission and a bitter enemy of the scientist. These two strands take up the last hour of “Oppenheimer,” and, to be blunt, they could have made their point – the humbling of Prometheus – in half the time. The narrative excitement Nolan has built with care and craft is allowed to dissipate; the air leaks out of the movie. The toggling between color and black and white starts to seem baroque, and the huge cast that has seemed so crucial to the sense of history rolling inexorably forward – Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr, Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, actors like Rami Malek, David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine, and Jason Clarke as physicists and politicians – dwindles into Gary Oldman’s sideshow turn as Harry Truman. Sadly, Downey Jr.’s finely calibrated performance is allowed to go hambone in the final scenes, when Strauss flies into a spittle-flecked rage upon learning his political ambitions may be thwarted. That final hour is doubly disappointing for the brilliance of the two hours that have preceded it. You may not mind. “Oppenheimer” captures the rapture and dread of perhaps the most critical moment in our species’ journey toward apotheosis and/or annihilation: A group of men and women holding their collective breath in a nighttime desert, waiting for an atom to split and the false sun of the future to rise. If you’re not a paying subscriber and would like to sign up for additional postings and to join the discussions — or just help underwrite this enterprise, for which the author would be very grateful — here’s how. Not to be of course, but would have loved to get McCarthy’s take on the film. His Tennessee roots and decades sequester at the SantaFe and preoccupation with physics and human flaws Stella Maris, etc….",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” was the first thought of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist whose leadership of the Manhattan Project saddled him with the unwelcome title of “father of the atomic bomb,” as he observed the weapon’s 1945 test explosion in the desert of New Mexico. Twenty years later, in a TV interview that’s still harrowing to watch, a conscience-stricken Oppenheimer recalled how that line, a quote from the ancient Hindu scripture the Bhagavad-Gita, sprang into his mind as he saw for the first time the awesome destructive potential of the weapon his top-secret team of elite scientists had just taken three years and spent more than a billion dollars to create. In his gargantuan biopic Oppenheimer, based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, Christopher Nolan makes the startling choice to turn this painfully introspective moment into a recalled instance of highbrow pillow talk. The only time we hear the famous line said aloud (as opposed to replayed in the physicist’s head) is when, as a young professor at the University of California at Berkeley, Oppenheimer (played by longtime Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy) reads it to his girlfriend Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) as she writhes atop him in bed, the text in its original Sanskrit held open against her bare chest. It is true that, when at Berkeley in the ’30s, Oppenheimer, a multilingual polymath, studied Hindu texts in Sanskrit. It’s also true that he had an intense three-year affair with Tatlock, a psychiatrist and devoted Communist who died in 1944 by apparent suicide. But the fictionalized juxtaposition of these two facts in the context of an R-rated sex scene makes for an unintentionally comic interlude in an epic that, understandably given its subject, is otherwise short on humor. Still, this nude scene, along with one later in the film when an older, married Oppenheimer returns to Tatlock’s apartment for a one-night tryst, constitutes a rare occurrence in the director’s normally sexless filmography. Despite its three-hour run time and the epic scale of its widescreen IMAX image, Oppenheimer is the most intimate movie the emotionally chilly Nolan has yet made. It tells the story of an event one character calls “the most important fucking thing to happen in the history of the world”—the development and first (and so far only) use of nuclear weapons in wartime—yet the action often seems to be taking place in the interior of one man’s prodigious and tormented brain. The film’s narrative chronology is so fragmented it seems to have taken its cue from the recurring image of a black field studded with swirling points of light, a seeming reference to both the starry night skies above Los Alamos, New Mexico, and the subatomic micro-events the Manhattan Project team is trying to observe and manipulate. The story zigzags freely and sometimes confusingly among two main timelines. One, presented in color, provides Oppenheimer’s view of his life, from the 1920s, when Oppenheimer was a troubled student in Europe, to the 1930s, when he ran in Berkeley’s left-wing circles while romancing the fiercely political Tatlock, and through the mid-1940s, when he directed the Manhattan Project’s central laboratory while living with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), also a onetime Communist sympathizer. This timeline is narrated via Oppenheimer’s near-verbatim testimony about his life story at a humiliating series of 1954 hearings in which he was stripped of his security clearance by the board of the Atomic Energy Commission after he objected to the planned development of an even more destructive weapon, the hydrogen bomb. The other timeline, presented in black and white, provides the view of Oppenheimer’s chief postwar antagonist, the shoe salesman turned political operative Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), as Strauss testifies at his own 1959 Senate confirmation hearings. Strauss was a founding member and eventual chairman of the AEC who led the charge to bring down Oppenheimer, using the Red Scare paranoia of the McCarthy era to paint the scientist’s long-ago left-wing alliances as opportunities for Soviet espionage. In what may be the most memorable performance in a movie full of bravura acting turns, Downey plays Strauss as a would-be power player driven nearly to madness by his own petty vanity and unrealized ambition. His Iron Man exoskeleton now finally retired for good, Downey reminds us what a versatile and emotionally intelligent actor he has always been, while playing a character much colder and more calculating than the charming scamps of his youth. Matt Damon brings a warmer, if far from cuddly, energy to Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, the career Army officer who, fresh from the task of overseeing the construction of the Pentagon, hired Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project and served as the team’s military liaison throughout the three years it took to complete the work. Groves was known as a hard-driving, plain-spoken boss, and his relationship with the cerebral, unconventional, and fiercely independent Oppenheimer had more than its share of tense showdowns. These scenes are among the movie’s most dramatically convincing, as Groves’ bluff pragmatism collides with Oppenheimer’s visionary and sometimes inscrutable management style. The supporting cast of Oppenheimer is an impressive “dudes rock” lineup, with a seemingly endless parade of name actors showing up in supporting roles: Kenneth Branagh as the Danish physicist Niels Bohr, Josh Hartnett as the Nobel Prize–winning scientist Ernest Lawrence, Benny Safdie as Oppenheimer’s collaborator and eventual betrayer Edward Teller, and Tom Conti, appearing principally in two scenes near the beginning and end of the movie, as an elderly, philosophical Albert Einstein. Flashing past in even smaller roles are Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Dane DeHaan, Matthew Modine, and Gary Oldman. Though there are two women with meaningful screen time, Blunt’s volatile, hard-drinking Kitty Oppenheimer and Pugh’s passionate, self-destructive Jean Tatlock, neither ever emerges as a full character separate from her romantic link to the protagonist—Nolan’s long-standing problem with writing complex roles for women remains, as of this movie, unfixed. This is mainly a film about groups of men in rooms, arguing over decisions that will affect the future of everyone on the planet. An extended sequence portraying the Trinity test—the July 1945 experiment in New Mexico in which the bomb was deployed for the first time–constitutes Oppenheimer’s cinematic high point. The mounting tension of the preparations, with observers stationed miles from the detonation site and equipped with small squares of dark glass through which to view the blast without damaging their eyes, culminates in a countdown to the pressing of an actual red button. It’s the most literal rendering imaginable of a high-stakes moment—and one whose result we already know to boot—yet the scene is suffused with a sense of suspense and dread that’s near unbearable. The explosion itself, re-created without the use of CGI, is filmed with a gravity and an eerie, unromanticizing beauty that more than justifies a second use of Oppenheimer’s famous “I am become Death” quote—this time heard only echoing in his head, his mistress’s recent suicide providing a gloomy foreshadowing of the mass destruction his invention is about to wreak. The Trinity test sequence also stands out because, for a few seconds during and after the explosion, the audience has an experience Oppenheimer rarely provides us: silence. Whether it’s the Hans Zimmer–scored BRAHHHMMS of Inception or the muddy sound mixes of Interstellar and Tenet—movies whose dialogue audiences often found inaudible—Nolan has long been a filmmaker who likes to experiment with layer on layer of overwhelming sound. Oppenheimer’s use of this tool can be both viscerally powerful, as in the scene just described, and suffocatingly oppressive. My viewing companion praised Ludwig Göransson’s unsettling violin-based score; to me, however appropriately anxiety-producing the music may have been, its omnipresence under virtually every line of dialogue felt invasive, as if I were watching a never-ending trailer. Nolan’s reliance on the score to goose the audience’s emotional involvement almost has an element of insecurity to it, as if he didn’t trust a story about the invention of the atom bomb to be upsetting enough on its own. Though it’s unquestionably a visual achievement and an often-overpowering viewing experience, I can’t say I loved or even liked every element of Oppenheimer. Nolan wrote the screenplay without any collaborators, and there’s an element of Nolanian bombast to some of the dialogue, with characters uttering such biopic-ready lines as “And you, Robert Oppenheimer, sphinxlike guru of the atom—no one knows what you believe.” The fractured timeline isn’t always handled with the skillful sense of balance it requires, making the movie’s last hour feel unnaturally protracted. And though it’s true that Oppenheimer was a secular Jew whose faith played a small part in his private life, the fact of his Judaism was not insignificant, either in the context of his race against Hitler’s Germany to build an atomic weapon or of his later vilification in the antisemitic political climate of the Cold War. Cillian Murphy is extraordinary at conveying Oppenheimer’s otherworldly mental capacities and his bouts of self-doubt and depression, but the Irish actor seems about as Jewish as Max von Sydow. While we’re on the subject of ethnic representation: Though I’m not completely on board with the critique that Oppenheimer fails to address the invention of the A-bomb from a Japanese point of view—it is, after all, based on a biography of the weapon’s inventor, not the infinitely larger and more tragic story of that invention’s victims—it is notable that the only glimpse we’re provided of the bomb’s real-world effect on human bodies comes in the form of a hallucinatory vision of a future radiation victim, projected onto the face of an American woman applauding the success of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Though the entirety of the film is an anticipatory shudder inspired by the horrors to come, those horrors remain placeless and abstract, never linked to the hundreds of thousands of individuals whose lives the bomb either ended or damaged irreparably. Still, for younger audiences to whom the name Oppenheimer means little, this mostly historically accurate telling of his story will be a bracing lesson, and to those of us who grew up in the atmosphere of the Cold War, it can serve as a terrifying reminder. It was only late last year that the U.S. government vacated the results of the 1954 AEC hearing that is correctly characterized in the movie as a kangaroo court. The story of the scientist who changed the world forever is not yet over, as long as the Damoclean sword of the technology he pioneered still hangs above all of our heads. Nolan’s film about him is one I couldn’t help but admire, even if, like the observers of the Trinity test, I could observe it only from a distance, at once awed and ambivalent.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Oppenheimer--This biopic splits time the way its hero splits the atom. Narrative is fissionable to writer-director Christopher Nolan; he skips back and forth between episodes of Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as a bumbling student, then as a philandering rising star in the new field of quantum physics, then as the determined yet haunted lord of Los Alamos, then as a post-bomb martyr to '50s era red-baiting. It glides along smoothly through its fractured scheme, beautifully shot by Hoyt van Hoytema in black and white and varyingly muted shades of color depending on period and point of view, and pushed along by a solemn Philip Glass-esque score by Ludwig Göransson. Often crowned by a horizontal wide-brimmed preacher-style hat that makes him look like Brad Dourif in Wise Blood, Murphy uncannily captures the bursting, wide-eyed, near-ecstatic face that we see in photos of Oppenheimer. But he manages to give the performance a human dimension, with everyday foibles and touches of humor. He's not a pageant figure. Murphy carries a star presence. But he's very ably supported by a huge, colorful gallery of star character players: Robert Downey Jr. as AEC Chairmen Lewis Strauss and Josh Hartnett as Ernest Lawrence and Benny Safdie as Edward Teller and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein and David Krumholtz as Isidore Rabi, Oppenheimer's menschy colleague who makes sure he eats and nudges his conscience, and Matthew Modine and Casey Affleck and Kenneth Branagh and Rami Malek and Alden Ehrenreich, to name only a few. They're all entertaining, but two in particular jolt the movie to life: Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's joyless lover Jean Tatlock and Matt Damon as the practical-minded, professionally unimpressed Leslie Groves, representing us laypeople in his deadpan, flummoxed scenes with Murphy. For a while it seems like Emily Blunt is underserved as Kitty Oppenheimer, but near the end she gets a juicy, angry scene opposite AEC lawyer Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), who has underestimated her.  Other than maybe a few too many scenes of the young ""Oppie"" having visions that look like the psychedelic mindtrip at the end of 2001, there was no point where I found Oppenheimer less than absorbing. Few would suggest that this ambitious, superbly acted, superbly crafted film isn't a major, compelling work, a vast expansion on Roland Joffé's watchable but modest Fat Man and Little Boy from 1989. If Nolan's film isn't quite completely satisfying, there could be two reasons. One is that trying to arrive at a moral conclusion about this movie's hero seems impossible. Put (too) simply: on the one hand, Oppenheimer won World War II for the good guys and checked fascism (not checkmated it, alas) for more than half a century. On the other hand, his invention killed hundreds of thousands of people, and still has the potential to ruin the world for everybody. Both can be true, and the ambiguity is unresolvable. Another problem with the film, however, is a matter of simple showmanship. Back in 1994, James Cameron brought his silly action picture True Lies to a point where Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis kiss while, far in the distance, we see a mushroom cloud erupt on the horizon. Triumphant, but then Cameron pushed his luck, piling on one last struggle with the villain in a Harrier jet. I remember thinking (and writing) at the time that when your hero and heroine kiss in front of a mushroom cloud, the movie is over. Oppenheimer, obviously a very different movie, is uneasily structured in the same way. The scenes leading up to the Trinity Test at White Sands in 1945 are riveting, pulse pounding. The explosion and the immediate aftermath, ending the war in Japan, is a stunning dramatic climax. But then the movie keeps going, for another hour or so, detailing the war of spite and will between Strauss and Oppenheimer, and the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. It's interesting, provocative material in itself, but it seems a little petty and trivial after the ""I am become death; destroyer of worlds"" stuff. Given Nolan's supposed consummate skill at scrambling sequence, couldn't he have somehow structured the movie to end with a bang and not a whimper? Barbie--Something is rotten in the state of Barbieland. As this, her first live-action feature begins, our titular heroine finds herself haunted, right in the middle of raging dance parties at her Dreamhouse, by thoughts of death. Still more alarming, when she steps out of her pumps, her feet go flat to the ground. To be clear, the Barbie in question, played by Margot Robbie, is ""Stereotypical Barbie,"" the blond, inhumanly thin and leggy iconic version of the Mattel doll. She shares the relentlessly cheery pink-plastic realm of Barbieland with countless other Barbies of every race and body shape and profession, all happy and accomplished and untroubled and mutually supportive. They're dimly aware of us in the ""Real World""; they believe that their own harmony has created an example that has led to female empowerment and civil rights over here. The Barbies also share Barbieland with Ken (Ryan Gosling) and countless variant Kens, as well as Ken's featureless friend Allan (a perfectly cast Michael Cera). But the guys exist entirely as accessories to the relatively uninterested Barbies. Ken's unrequited fascination with Barbie makes him subject, unlike the Barbies, to dissatisfaction. Barbie goes for advice to ""Weird Barbie"" (Kate McKinnon), whose hair is frizzy and patchy and who's stuck in a permanent split. She's told that her troubles come from the dark feelings of somebody who's playing with her in our reality, so she sets out on a quest to the Real World, emerging in Venice Beach. Barbie connects with a mom and teenage daughter (America Ferrera and Ariana Greenblatt) whose relationship is strained; she's also pursued by the all-male board of Mattel, led by Will Ferrell. Ken, meanwhile, learns about our patriarchy, likes what he hears, and heads back to Barbieland alone to institute it, with himself at the top. Mattel was founded in 1945, the same year as the Trinity Test, and there are probably feminist social critics who would argue that Barbie, invented in 1959 by Mattel co-founder Ruth Handler (well played by Rhea Perlman in the film), has wreaked only a little less havoc on the modern psyche than Oppenheimer's gadget. Even though I'm in exactly the right generational wheelhouse (I was born in 1962), my own childhood experience with Barbie was very limited, and thus so were my nostalgic associations with her. Even so, this nutty fantasy, directed by Greta Gerwig from a brilliant script she wrote with Noah Baumbach, made me laugh from its inspired first scene to its Wings of Desire finish. Narrated in the droll, arch tones of Helen Mirren, it manages to come across as both an ingenious pop-culture lampoon/celebration and an unpretentious but surprisingly heartfelt deep dive into the implications of the Barbie archetype. I wasn't a big fan of Gerwig's 2019 version of Little Women, but here she builds her world with the freedom of, well, a kid playing with dolls, but also with the confidence and adult perspective of an artist. Not everything in the movie works; in the second half the narrative gets a little lost at times in some very strange musical numbers/battle scenes, and the whole thing comes close to going on a bit too long. And it's hard to say just who this movie is for. It hardly seems intended for little girls; however smart, they're too young for the commentary about female identity to mean much to them yet. It seems more like it's meant for adult women with both a fondness for and an ambivalence toward Barbie. No doubt there are those who would also complain that, however witty and self-effacing, the movie amounts to a feature-length commercial for the brand. But in the age of Marvel and other such franchises, it seems a little late to object to this. The revelation in the film is Margot Robbie. It seems ridiculous that she's able, in the role of freaking Barbie, to give a performance of such subtlety and nuance and shading and quiet, unforced wistfulness, but she does. And she gets to deliver the best last line of the year. Theater Camp--Joan, the founder of ""AdirondACTS,"" a slightly gone-to-seed theater camp in upstate New York, has fallen into a coma. The job of keeping the struggling camp afloat falls to her decidedly non-theatrical ""crypto bro"" son Troy. Meanwhile the devoted instructors work with the exuberantly happy campers to mount the shows, including an original musical about the life of poor comatose Joan (Amy Sedaris). Needless to say, all does not go smoothly. The creators of this Waiting for Guffman-esque ""mockumentary"" comedy, Molly Gordon, Nick Lieberman, Ben Platt and Noah Galvin, know the world they're depicting very well; all of them have been doing theater since they were small children. Gordon and Lieberman co-directed, from a script by all four; Platt and Gordon play Amos and Rebecca-Diane, the utterly enmeshed, co-dependent acting instructors and Galvin plays the low-profile tech director. They capture the camaraderie and the sense of belonging that theater can give kids, and their affection for that world is unmistakable, but they're careful not to get too sentimental. The envies and resentments and passive-aggressive denigrations among theater folk, especially at this often professionally frustrated level, are vividly represented. Getting laughs from the self-important vanities of theater people is pretty low-hanging fruit, I suppose, but Theater Camp is nonetheless often hilarious. The film also manages to get a little deeper at times, touching on the irony that while theater can create a haven and a community for misfit kids, this can generate its own clannishness and exclusionary snobbery, as in Amos and Rebecca-Diane's coldness toward the imbecilic but well-intentioned Troy, charmingly played by a sort of poor-man's Channing Tatum named Jimmy Tatro. The real joy in Theater Camp, of course, is the acting: Platt, Gordon, Tatro, plus a few vets like Sedaris, Caroline Aaron and David Rasche bring the material to life. But as Glenn, the long-suffering backstage drudge who really ought to be onstage, Noah Galvin, who replaced Platt on Broadway in Dear Evan Hansen, is the revelation among the adults in the cast. He's a knockout. The revelation among the kids playing the campers is, well, pretty much all of the kids playing the campers. There are some real singing, dancing and acting prodigies in this company. If there was a real theater camp somewhere with this kind of talent, their shows would sell out.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Strike! The Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) are marching the picket lines and production, for the most part, has shut down. Film, TV, and streaming are not producing new works. For the foreseeable, films and shows will be released, without the help of actor promotion. And unless it settles, new shows will run out leaving room for news, sports and reality shows. Union members seek living wages, better health coverage, and crucially, protection from AI.  As of now those 65 years of age lose health coverage and face pension caps and residuals are shrinking. And regarding AI protections, as it stands, the majority of players are to be scanned, for one day’s pay, and the studio will own and use their images freely for eternity. Once lower-tier actors are scanned then it’s the big stars, directors, writers, landscapes, locations and there goes film’s human soul. Bitter online battles between the studios and actors aren’t helping.  Check comments by Disney’s Bob Iger and SAG member Ron Perlman.  Hollywood often sets the pace for cultural, scientific, and technological change so we’re in a desert of mins-numbing reality shows for the foreseeable. All of this as two of the year’s most potentially profitable films debut. It’s Barbenheimer,  an historic conversion, a clash of the titles opening on the same day. Warner Brother’s Barbie and Universal’s Oppenheimer are locked in a power play, thanks partly to studio rivalry. Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan left Warners to make Oppenheimer at Universal, see? It’s unwise to force two huge openings, one loses and one wins in box office take.  However, fans with cooler heads than Hollywood, are challenging folks to see both films on the same weekend or better, same days, while cosplaying. Just for giggles, so that’s new, and may help level the playing field. Nolan’s Oppenheimer stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, “Destroyer of Worlds” a 3-hour, seat-rattling spectacle, thrust into a vast moral fog as he develops the atomic bomb. Nolan says it reflects the present “Oppenheimer moment” of war, arms, and global division. Oppy was a young American theoretical physicist, who studied systems of natural phenomena based on mathematical models and abstractions of physical objects in motion. He’d been surveilled by the FBI for his Communist leanings but was allowed to join the atomic bomb research team at Los Alamos in 1942 because he was uniquely suited. He delivered and witnessed the first ever nuclear bomb, the test explosion Trinity (“three Gods”) at Los Alamos in 1945. Its success roused creators, and government and military officials, but the sensation was a complex mix of intellectual reward and moral horror. Oppy said later that he didn’t regret it, but Nolan shows quite the opposite. His thoughtful, exciting, and creative direction stamps him as an exceptional artist. A triumph of balance, intellect, excitement, and psychological soundness, of political, historical, and human significance, and of poetry, the music of science and beauty. It’s a masterpiece, and extraordinary philosophical experience, and an entertainment, and easily one of the best big films, ready to take its place in history. Also stars Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and a mass of name stars and character players. A telling and amusing conceit as Albert Einstein’s (Tom Conti) single facial expression changes the course of history. Bonus – How refreshing to listen to clear, concise, crisp, forward-moving dialogue. At the opposite end of the spectrum and vying for the same theatregoer’s dollar is the live-action, acid-pink Barbie movie from Greta Gerwig. Margot Robbie is the timeless, ageless, ever-cheerful, and wholesomely sexy doll from Mattel. She’s Stereotypical Barbie, sort of human even though she lives in a pink world, pink sky, pink home, pink air, pink, pink, pink! with a big grin. She’s one of all the Barbies (interesting cameos Dua Lipa and Alexandra Shipp) in Barbieland, a perfectly ordered Palm Springs pink village of Dreamhouses. Kate McKinnon is palate cleanser Weird Barbie, thankfully. Ryan Gosling is Ken as is fellow Canadian Simu and the others including Vera’s morgue man Kingsley Ben-Adir. They sing and dance and put on musicals all day long until the Barbies suddenly wake up to the fact that death exists. Barbie (Robbie) is thrust into an existential quandary that takes her on a road trip to the Real World. There she begins to come into herself and looks for ways to take control of their lives, with the Barbies, and escape the crushing patriarchy that the Kens symbolise. Lots of sly jokes and double entendres for the parents and energy for the fans, the music’s cranked really loud and the acid colours scream at the audience as the girls concoct new awareness. Barbie has always been Mattel’s groundbreaker, introducing new ethnicities and prestigious jobs for decades, and the film is the perfect 2023 iteration. Everyone is represented in this joyous, woman-forward human cartoon. And wow, that’s an emotional last act. Do you think Oppenheimer is dense? How about this one? Try to look away for a split second. Impossible. Now back to AI, bombs, warfare, and inventions with the potential to turn on humanity. Netflix‘ documentary Unknown: Killer Robots from Jesse Sweet is an alarming study of the development of AI, the kind that terrifies us, autonomous machine learning, as it applies to the military. American companies such as Sheild AI have weaponized drones as ersatz soldiers, replacing them in war settings, searching and destroying the enemy in multiples (“swarms”) based on human commands. But they can and are programmed to proceed based on their own learning and decisions in missions to kill “hostiles”, as we see at a San Diego movie ranch now a military testing site, following armed drones up, through windows and hallways, down staircases, and in and out of rooms, looking for targets. Those hostiles could be innocents; they don’t distinguish between enemy and neutral. The technology developing at a rapid rate, rushed by the White House towards the US’ favour in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Iraq.  Russia and China are also racing to develop their own learning AI weapons.  It’s the Cold War all over again. There are advantages to AI drones, they don’t feel fear or death because it’s not programmed. AI learning is invaluable in medicine, inventing vast numbers of medications as compared to human research. Learning AI helps predict and fight forest fires, along with many other applications. But the ethical implications of their use in war must be weighed. Chilling. I’m particularly struck by the casual way the folks at Shield AI talk about their achievements. One of four documentaries in Netflix’ Unknown series. Also on Netflix, a fascinating portrait of the gay and trans community in pre-WWII Berlin, El Dorado: Everything the Nazis Hate. Another timely offering as walls close in around nonbinary folks in the US, parts of Africa, and elsewhere in the world. Gay oppression seems to be a pre-existing factor for societies to turn towards fascism. Germany’s Weimar era 1919 to 1933, was alive with new arts and music, exploration of sexuality, expression, and acceptance of radical lifestyle ideas.  In the early thirties, Hitler and his goons were rising in influence and power, seeking a pure Germany, a superior Aryan uber state of blue-eyed blondes, fit, malleable, and sexually “normal”. The new freedoms of the Weimar offended Hitler and his far righties; the result was attempted genocide of the LGBTQ2 community.  Codirector/writers Benjamin Cantu, and Matt Lambert take us to the famed El Dorado nightclub – “Where It Is Right”- with reenactments of the wild and free goings on there, onstage and in the crowds. Ernst Rohm, an architect of Hitler’s Reich was a regular; he and his circle expressed their hatred of women as they picked up drag performers and Hitler looked the other way. The gay crowd was soon subject to street beatings, fires, and arrest, then they were shipped off to camps, murdered, and buried in mass graves. We meet survivors, including two men who live the American Dream today in Hollywood as musicians and composers. Hitler didn’t manage to get them all. Riveting.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," One read of Christopher Nolan’s intimate, affecting portrait of J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most influential people of the modern age, is that the physicist was possessed of a dangerous narcissist personality disorder. His quest for self-importance and admiration competed with the creation of the world-altering invention for which he’s known. The atomic bomb makes a thunderous, awe-inspiring appearance in Nolan’s sprawling ensemble epic. Still, the concentration on the title character’s ego makes the film more of a personal story and less of a historical one. An oppressive sense of urgency is built into this artful telling of one man’s pursuit of immortality. As the momentous events in Europe and the Pacific marched forward during WWII, the brilliant physicist was put in charge of the project to develop the powerful war-ending weapon. In “Oppenheimer,” we see Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) select the controversial intellectual to direct a top collection of scientists. The task of assembling the team plays out like an exciting heist film. And because his colleagues so well respect Oppenheimer, access to the best minds is assured. Convincing them to participate in an extreme scientific and social experiment takes some arm-twisting. The idea is to isolate these competitive geniuses in the middle of nowhere--Los Alamos, New Mexico. In this place, they will precisely focus on the intricate construction of the atomic bomb. It is believed that the Germans had a significant head start. The race to catch up and win seems like an insurmountable task. A town is constructed on the barren landscape. The scientists and their families are brought in, and a sense of community is artificially established. And as the mayor, sheriff, and project manager, the cold, calculating J. Robert Oppenheimer demands nothing less than a peerless commitment to the cause. Once there, you can’t leave; he won’t let you. L to R: Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer, Olli Haaskivi is Edward Condon, Matt Damon is Leslie Groves, and Dane Dehaan is Kenneth Nichols in OPPENHEIMER, written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. But this rail-thin, mercurial man at the center of all the vital moving parts has skeletons. And Nolan’s script borrows key revelations explored in the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. While studying at Cambridge as a young person, Oppenheimer poisoned with deadly cyanide an apple on the desk of a tutor. While he narrowly prevented the consumption of the killer fruit, the event tells of the man’s conflicted soul. Bird and Sherwin go deeper into Oppenheimer’s formative years, marked by oddness and awkwardness, especially with members of the opposite sex. Nolan hints at these difficulties, but the bulk of his narrative concerns the adult Oppenheimer, whose superior intellect intimidates and enchants those around him. We meet his early partner Jean Tatlock (a brave turn by Florence Pugh). Tatlock’s connection to the Communist Party proves troublesome for Oppenheimer, who never joined the Party but contributed to adjacent causes and shared sympathies with controversial unionization efforts. Gen. Groves selected Oppenheimer with full knowledge of Oppenheimer’s background. The general’s laser focus on the endgame permits him to ignore certain distasteful aspects of the gifted physicist’s character. And Oppenheimer’s relationship with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) is in constant turmoil but kept behind closed doors until it isn’t, and the flood comes rushing forth. Nolan’s typical storytelling structural touches set the film in various time periods, both before and after the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The movie is shot in IMAX, a large-format film typically associated with capturing expansive vistas and thrilling action sequences. With the assistance of Oscar-nominated cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (see “Dunkirk”), Nolan moves the wide angles in closer than usual IMAX productions. The effect of such broader capturing of images makes everything seem more personal, even hypnotic. And Nolan’s decision to switch between color and black & white helps to sharpen our understanding of the differing eras. L to R: Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss and Cillian Murphy is J. Robert Oppenheimer in OPPENHEIMER, written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. In black & white, we meet Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), the head of the US Atomic Energy Commission (the “AEC”) formed after WWII. Strauss is involved in a contentious Senate confirmation hearing. He hopes to be confirmed as President Eisenhower’s commerce secretary. His rocky relationship with Oppenheimer becomes an issue at the hearings. “Oppenheimer” slips back and forth between the events in Los Alamos, the confirmation hearings in Washington, and a closed-door investigation into Oppenheimer’s security clearance as a member of AEC. Both Strauss and Oppenheimer share similar narcissistic traits. Their arrogance is a blessing and a curse. It makes them resolute leaders but has them always flying too close to the sun. The battle of wills on display gives the film an intensity that always hovers on a knife’s edge. The quest for control is fascinating, and Nolan’s complex script unravels like a mystery with the specter of a mushroom cloud hanging ominously in the distance. “Oppenheimer” is a visual and narrative achievement that towers above anything I’ve seen so far this year. The palpable drama is so thick that it is almost unbearable. While this film is a profile of the title character, it is also an etching of Strauss. And while Murphy is a standout in the lead, Downey is a lock for end-of-year nominations as a supporting actor. Downey is so good here and so perfectly cast that I wouldn’t be surprised to see him standing on the Oscar stage next year. The production is flawless. As a filmmaker myself, I was both taken aback by Nolan’s craftsmanship and intimidated by the skill he exhibits in his storytelling. The success of the third act, which often evades lesser directors, demonstrates the work of an unparalleled master who learned from his misstep with 2020’s “Tenet.” “Oppenheimer” is an unabashed masterpiece befitting the outstanding atomic achievement and securing the physicist’s legacy in a way that is sad, inspiring, and without pretense.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Lisa Johnson Mandell’s Oppenheimer review says this is a film for the ages- an explosive film that will instill reverence for the wonders of cinema. About fifteen minutes into Oppenheimer, I knew this would be an epic film for the ages. This is one that will be taught in advanced college classes. This is one that will win many awards for 2023, yes, but it will also be considered one of the best films of the decade, perhaps the century. Director Christopher Nolan tells a story that has been told before—That of J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom most people know as “The Father of the Atomic Bomb.” But it takes a brilliant, complicated man to come up with an invention so powerful, so revelatory, and Nolan does a remarkable job of showing his many facets, which are often conflicting. For maximum enjoyment of this deliciously layered film, read a little about Oppenheimer before you enter the theater. It doesn’t have to be a lengthy biography, like the Pulitzer Prize winning American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, upon which the movie is based. It could be as simple as the Wikipedia entry, which, I found after perusing it, is not all that simple either. This will help you enjoy the film’s many intricate nuances, without being overly invested in keeping up with the details of the plot. And there are many, just as you would expect from a three-hour Christopher Nolan film. Don’t let that run time intimidate you. The cinematography Hoyte van Hoytema, Ludwig Göransson’s compelling score, Jennifer Lame’s remarkable editing and the Herculean efforts of writer/director Nolan, will keep you riveted. As will the acting. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, Robert Downy Jr. who is unrecognizable as “Oppie’s” colleague Lewis Strauss, Florence Pugh as his lover Jean Tatlock and Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty are shoo-ins for Oscar noms, but the work of Matt Damon, Bennie Safde, Alden Ehrenreich and Dane Dehaan should not go unnoticed either. This is a film that requires your full attention—an exercise for the for the mind and heart, that will doubtless be followed by one of the most erudite conversations you’ve had in ages. It does everything all the best films do, it makes you feel, makes you think, makes you wonder. What more could you ask for in a movie? Even popcorn is optional.

"Jul 21, 2023","  his brilliant, bruising take on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the dark knight of the atomic age. Murphy's pale blue eyes become a path into a tortured soul as Nolan—a true film artist in works as diverse as ""Memento"" and ""Dunkirk,"" creates a new film classic. Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman's 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" Nolan's three-hour-plus masterpiece fills up our senses with the details of quantum mechanics to ignite the story of an American theoretical physicist who helped invent the ultimate weapon of mass destruction and lived to regret it. Murphy's performance, flawless in every detail, encompasses how Oppenheimer's Manhattan Project team relocated to Los Alamos, New Mexico, to accelerate development of the weapon that would help end WW2 through the cataclysmic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and usher in the threat of nuclear annihilation that's only escalated over time. Nolan uses radio reports to detail the effects of those bombs, saving the eye-searing visuals for the 1945 Trinity test in the New Mexico desert to bring home the destruction being unleashed. The superb sound design in which silence alternates with waves of reverberation to bring the unthinkable to devastating life is unmissable, unforgettable and scary as hell. Shot with Imax cameras by the great Hoyte van Hoytema, ""Oppenheimer"" deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with a state-of-the-art sound system. This despite the fact that the film is often a series of debates among scientists arguing in close-ups that find endless fascination in the geography of the human face. The actors in ""Oppenheimer could not be better. They include Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, the blustering military supervisor at Los Alamos, Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, who pushed to develop the even more dangerous hydrogen bomb, and Gary Oldman in a sensational cameo as Harry Truman, the president who ordered the use of the bomb on Japan and dismissed Oppenheimer as a ""crybaby"" for objecting. Oppy, as intimates called him, had a personal life that mirrored his professional turbulence. Though he mingled with such greats as Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Oppy's sexual entanglements, notably with psychologist Jean Tatlock (a mesmerizing Florence Pugh) made the wrong kind of headlines. His marriage to biologist Katherine ""Kitty"" Puening (Emily Blunt), an alcoholic suffering from postpartum depression, added to the chaos. Kudos to Blunt for building the role with a fierce independence as Kitty defended Oppy from the political gamesmanship that plagued him. In the riveting last section of the film, Nolan shows us Oppenheimer fighting against those eager to discredit him, first in the Sen. Joseph McCarthy commie witch-hunts of 1954 and five years later during the Senate confirmation hearings for the nomination of former  Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as secretary of commerce. Nolan shoots both these sections in a vivid black-and-white to underscore the resentment Strauss feels for Oppenheimer for hiding his Jewish roots, communist proclivities and fears about government backed nuclear energy. In a film of standout performances, Downey delivers a tour de force of festering animosity that blows the doors off. All his time in the Marvel universe might lead you to forget that Downey is one of the best actors on the planet. Here's a reminder. Prepare to be wowed. ""Oppenheimer,"" set to Ludwig Göransson's thundering orchestral score, is one of the best movies you'll see anywhere. With Nolan's extraordinary talent shining on its highest beams, the film emerges as a monumental achievement on the march into screen history.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," In the unyielding crucible of Christopher Nolan's cinematic imagination, where reality and illusion dance an eternal tango, emerges Oppenheimer — an audacious epic biographical thriller that plunges us into the complex, morally turbulent life of one J Robert Oppenheimer. This visionary theoretical physicist, whose seemingly boundless intellect birthed the awe-inspiring yet chilling dawn of the Atomic Age through the Manhattan Project, now takes centre stage as the enigmatic maestro of Nolan's masterful symphony. Cillian Murphy's magnetic performance as Oppenheimer, flanked by a stellar ensemble, gives a mesmerising tale of science, secrets, and conscience. Oppenheimer, both written and directed by Nolan, is a sweeping opus of historical significance that draws inspiration from Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin's seminal biography, American Prometheus (which everyone should definitely read). Oppenheimer suffered from a dilemma. His work on the Manhattan Project leads to the creation of the first nuclear weapons, which are later used in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, resulting in a devastating loss of life and the beginning of the atomic age. He grapples with the moral implications of his scientific achievements. On one hand, he is driven by an insatiable hunger for discovery and the pursuit of knowledge, which leads to groundbreaking advancements in the field of physics and the development of the atomic bomb. On the other hand, he is haunted by the destructive power of his own creations and the immense human suffering they cause.  Cillian Murphy, in a career-defining performance, brings the mysterious and tormented Oppenheimer to life with an almost otherworldly intensity (those deep blue eyes!). As he embarks on a perilous journey through the unfathomable realms of physics and morality, the portrayal captures the essence of a man torn between his insatiable hunger for discovery and the haunting spectre of the destruction he helps orchestrate. Murphy's performance embodies Oppenheimer as a scientific prodigy haunted by the terrible consequences of his own brilliance — a dichotomy that lays the groundwork for the film's emotional core.  Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer's long-suffering wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, stands as a pillar in a tempest of ethical dilemmas. She crafts a poignant and deeply affecting portrait of a woman, married to genius, who must deal with her husband's inner demons, the weight of her own moral convictions, and his adulterous tendencies. Even in a minor role, Blunt is superlative. But perhaps the biggest revelation of the movie comes from the unorthodox casting of Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Downey Jr, mostly renowned for playing Tony Stark or Iron man, delivers an astonishingly restrained and introspective performance that delves into the enigma of human conscience. His portrayal is one of quiet power, a stark reminder that even amidst the grandest schemes of science and war, the weight of ethical contemplation remains as heavy as the heart of an atom. The supporting cast, including Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh, further solidify Oppenheimer as a gripping ensemble piece. Each actor (and there are many, many renowned faces that appear for a few minutes of screen time) breathes life into their respective characters, weaving an intricate tapestry of personal motivations, political maneuverings, and ethical quandaries.  Nolan's signature style, with its non-linear narrative, transcends mere storytelling, guiding the audience through a labyrinth of time and memory. Seamlessly transitioning between Oppenheimer's past and present, Nolan skillfully explores the fluidity of memory, perception, and remorse. His directorial prowess, matched with the stunning artistry of Hoyte van Hoytema, turns Oppenheimer into an exquisite visual epic, with many memorable visual images. The Trinity Test, which proved to the US government that this weapon indeed was as destructive as the scientists claimed, is depicted as an event of Biblical proportions. A moment of celebration comes a little later, but at first everyone is shaken by the enormity of the thing.  Ludwig Göransson thunderous and evocative score, a lot like the other Nolan regular Hans Zimmer, surges like the pulse of a splitting atom, heightening the film's emotional crescendos and lending palpable urgency to Oppenheimer's quest for both scientific truth and personal redemption. His composition serves as the heartbeat of the film, pulsating with emotion and propelling the narrative forward like a force of nature. It shouldn't. It didn't definitely bother me. The pace is not exactly blistering fast, but clever editing by Jennifer Lame (of Hereditary and Nolan's own Tenet fame) ensures that the film remains tightly constructed without unnecessary padding. There is a lot of talking. In fact, that is all, for the most part, there is. But Nolan is able to instill a sense of urgency and significance to the unfolding events.  As Oppenheimer unfolds, Nolan presents us with a kaleidoscope of ethical dilemmas that transcend time. The film's resonance lies not only in its historical accuracy but also in its exploration of the human condition, the pursuit of knowledge, and the choices that shape our destinies. ",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," There is a moment when watching a movie where the narrative on the screen and the mind of the viewer locks into place. It could take twenty minutes, it could take an hour, or it could never come at all. In Christopher Nolan’s sweeping biopic on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, that connection is instant. The story of this man, his life, his brilliant mind, and the haunting responsibility of creating the atomic bomb grips you from frame one. Like the waves from a blast, Nolan moves at a blazing speed, displaying the constant struggle of a man, surrounded by members of the scientific community, and a world on the cusp of its own destruction. Oppenheimer is relentless and powerful. This is the crowning achievement of Christopher Nolan’s career and shakes the ground of the cinematic landscape. Throughout all of Nolan’s work, I have often seen similarities and connections with that of Ridley Scott’s films. The two have made their share of great science fiction but have also made a series of films that feel intertwined by themes and scale. It makes that bond even stronger when Oppenheimer opens with a quote about Prometheus, the human that stole fire from the Gods and gave it to humanity, as the screenplay is adapted from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Scott’s 2012 science fiction film- titled Prometheus– is an Alien hybrid but is also about scientists messing with something they don’t know its true power. That is a constant theme of Oppenheimer, a story about a man who is smart enough to take science to a point, but when he passes the Rubicon, going beyond theory to where the results are out of his hands, and the realization that the power he wields will destroy lives. The cast is equally on the same page as those themes that Nolan is telling. Cillian Murphy carries the lead performance with grief and stress, oscillating between a man elated by his work and a tortured genius. The narrative structure balances between flashbacks, picking up from Oppenheimer’s stint as a professor at California Berkeley, his early interests in communist causes, his leadership at the Los Alamos Laboratory, and the United States Government’s demonization of his work. He is anchored by a murderer’s row of great performances, with Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as Sergeant Leslie Groves, Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock, Josh Hartnett as colleague Earnest Lawrence, and Robert Downey Jr. delivering stellar work as the politically motivated Lewis Strauss. It’s with this long collective list of great actors where Oppenheimer feels related to Oliver Stone’s JFK, but also in dialogue, which is always pushing, twisting the tension, building up, and never distracting our focus. The three hours will leave audiences exhausted not for its runtime but for how intense the material becomes. Like many of Nolan’s other films, such as Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Tenet, it subtly becomes about time. Through the powerful sound design of Randy Torres and the score of Ludwig Goransson, there is a constant ticking in the background. It is a reminder of the race between the U.S. and the Germans to build the bomb first, the unrelenting pressure that was placed on Oppenheimer, and creating a great sense of paranoia at the moment. That ticking reverberates, blending in with gorgeous cinematography from Hoyte Van Hoytema, switching between vibrant color and crisp black & white, and using every inch of his IMAX frame. He does this not just to capture the settings but to interject orange glowing mushroom clouds to swirl in our eyes, similar to Terrence Malick’s Tree of Life, with the creation and destruction of humanity. All of this works because we are drawn in, hypnotized by the rhythm of it all, culminating in bomb testing, and an opening of Pandora’s box that cannot be stopped. This is without going into more details, but for some audience goers the subject matter will be too dense, but Nolan rightfully trusts us to engage. The director also makes the correct decision to not show the horrific bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is a biopic on Oppenheimer and the death and destruction that President Truman unleashed is a different movie. What Nolan does instead is walk us into the rooms with the men who wrestle with their moral conflict. We see Americans fighting with Americans, finger-pointing, and claims of treason. But the focus never pulls away from Oppenheimer. His presence looms large and his shadow even bigger. Oppenheimer is spectacular. It is a culmination of Christopher Nolan’s style, his fascination with science, the magnificent use of his 70MM celluloid, and his first flawless film. The story at hand is inherently an American one, of human ingenuity because we can, of flawed egos and bully politics, and above all about a man who wrestled with the path to his position in history. Oppenheimer is on a different level and undeniably one of the best movies of 2023.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," Who knew that “Barbie” could be the victim of an existential crisis? Margot Robbie is perfectly cast in Greta Gerwig’s wacky and wildly imaginative comedy about Mattel’s superstar doll. It’s the kind of movie that the term ‘meta’ was coined for. It throws darts at consumerism and male patriarchy by having Barbie transported from her fantasy sphere into the real world while Ryan Gosling’s Ken grapples with feelings of inferiority. Whew. While the double entendres will go over the kids’ heads, the material isn’t offensive. Still, this movie really isn’t for them. “Barbie” is for nostalgic adults who don’t mind having their childhood obsessions lampooned. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan’s epic biographical drama “Oppenheimer” is an engrossing and brilliantly realized biopic about the astute but troubled father of the atomic bomb. Irish actor Cillian Murphy is riveting as the renowned physicist, viewed here as a classically tragic hero. He suffered from enormous doubts as his intellectual brilliance and moral compass came into conflict with his crucial mission. A stellar cast complements Nolan’s cinematic artistry and razor-sharp vision. “Oppenheimer” is easily the year’s best movie. The Netflix comedy “They Cloned Tyrone” is a screwball mix of sci-fi, social commentary and homage to the Blaxploitation movies of the 1970s. John Boyega, Teyonah Parris and Jamie Foxx star in the tale of the residents of an inner-city neighborhood who uncover a vast government cloning conspiracy. It’s well acted, often funny and its observations are sharp. It’s also very profane and a bit disjointed. Still, “They Cloned Tyrone” is an impressive debut for filmmaker Juel Taylor.",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," There’s a moment early on in Oppenheimer when a buttonhole is stitched in the narrative fabric as the titular scientist shares a private moment with a figure we recognize as Albert Einstein. Filmed from a distance, their conversation is inaudible, but its repercussions proceed in a chain reaction that spans the rest of the film’s runtime, until, late in the third act, the button slides into place. That’s not a spoiler, just an acknowledgement of what audiences have come to expect from Christopher Nolan films: narrative complexity wrapped around cinematic payoff. Talky, dense and time-jumpy, Oppenheimer rewards close attention with a devastating final act that manages to raise the stakes a notch higher in the final moments.  Based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, and written for the screen by Nolan himself, Oppenheimer is about the man. Not the Bomb, not the Manhattan Project, not World War II or the Red Scare that followed, but just the guy—the physicist who led the project to develop an atomic weapon before the Germans could do it. Those other elements provide backdrop and context, but Nolan’s script crosscuts between different decades to touch on key moments both before and after the Bomb. Its eye-searing explosion provides a pivot point in the narrative. Before it goes off, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is singularly focused on delivering a product that proves his theory. Afterwards, moral doubts creep in, and that’s where the real drama is concentrated. In the same way that Nolan brought his sensibility and gravity to superhero films with The Dark Knight trilogy, he puts his imprint on the biopic genre with a story that both manipulates and discards convention. Murphy’s performance is remarkable, moving from swagger and sarcasm to something like shell-shock, with a glint of haunting in the eyes all the way through. By the end, we feel we understand something essential about the man, even if we haven’t been marched through the standard chronology. We glimpse him as a grim has-been being grilled by a government prosecutor, as a young professor seducing someone else’s wife at a cocktail party, as a strutting sheriff in the doomsday laboratory he built in the desert, and as a young physics student impulsively deciding to murder his professor. They’re all Oppenheimer, but they’re each vastly different from one another. This would make for a fascinating story even if it were all made up. But the man really did lead the team that built the bomb that put the human race on the brink of extinction, where we still dangle. On the morning of the first nuclear test at the Trinity site, General Grove (Matt Damon) asks about the risk factor of the atom bomb setting off an uncontrolled chain-reaction that could ignite the atmosphere and incinerate the entire planet. Oppenheimer assures him that the chances of that happening are “near zero.” The moment is played for comedy—and Damon is outstanding in bringing both levity and gravity to the performance—but the danger registers. In this story, theory is always being outdone by reality. Contradictions abound. Oppenheimer’s past as a communist-curious intellectual would seem to preclude him from running America’s most top-secret military program, and yet that very past makes him manipulable by higher-ups. Even though we know the broad outlines of this story from popular history, the script’s nested timelines pivot on multiple layers of paradoxes, betrayals, misunderstandings and unintended consequences. Like a shockwave lagging behind the initial flash of an explosion, the dramatic payoff sometimes hits long after the inciting incident. Eschewing action for abstraction, Nolan puts us in the troubled scientist’s head space. Here’s Oppenheimer staring at ripples spreading across a puddle in the rain, and we can see his mind turning. There’s very little math or physics in the movie, and not even very many explosions, but there is a lot of talking about those things. There’s also a lot of political maneuvering, centered around a slippery bureaucrat, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who witnessed that meeting between Oppenheimer and Einstein (Tom Conti) without understanding its implications. Like many other participants in this complex equation of a story, his theory fails to align with reality, with far-reaching consequences.  Nolan’s penchant for scrambled timelines and swift pacing keeps scenes shifting at a confident clip. Jennifer Lame’s fluid editing not only sets the pace but serves a narrative function as the storylines crosscut through Oppenheimer’s life, eliding key information until just the right moment to make it land. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema’s sophisticated use of color and black-and-white film differentiates points of view and suggests subjective versus objective perspectives. The familiar faces of the actors, variously de-aged and extra-aged, act as touchstones for orientation within these shuffling chronologies. In fact, the cast is stacked to an almost ridiculous degree, with small parts for Florence Pugh, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, and a deviously disguised Gary Oldman, among many others. Each of them is given a moment in the spotlight, and each makes a meal of it, particularly Pugh, whose intensity rivals that of the Bomb. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," When it comes to how he is viewed by the cinema world director Christopher Nolan is now in rare air. He doesn’t need to make a film with crazy stunts to have one of his movies deemed a blockbuster – just having his name on the poster does that. To be fair there are very directors that deserve that kind of credit but Nolan is certainly one of them. This is a man who started off making arthouse films like Memento and Insomnia and then he changed the comic book movie genre with his Batman trilogy – a franchise that showed that world that comic book movies could be solid, brilliant films. In amongst all of that he also delivered the masterpieces Inception and Dunkirk and even his films that have divided critics – The Prestige, Interstellar and Tenet – do deserve some credit for their originality. Tenet though does throw in an interesting curve ball in the lead up to Oppenheimer though. It universally is perhaps Nolan’s worst received film which may be a reason for some nervousness amongst his fans with his latest epic being released… but everyone can take a sigh of relief because Oppenheimer is a masterpiece that sees Nolan back to his amazing best. The film is told in two parts and chronicles the life of gifted scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy – Inception). The first part of the film explores his early struggles with lab work and then the pull from the influential Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jnr. – The Avengers) which saw Oppenhemier return to America to work as a lecturer. From there we see his failed relationship with fellow scientist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh – Black Widow), his introduction to the American Communist Party, his marriage to Kitty Openheimer (Emily Blunt – Edge Of Tomorrow) and his journey to being placed in charge of America’s Atomic Program under the watchful eye of Leslie Groves (Matt Damon – Air) as they try to create a weapon to end World War II. Thes second part of the film revolves around the political led investigation into Oppenheimer after the events of World War II. It shows what happens when the relationship between Oppenheimer and Strauss had soured, after Oppenheimer inadvertently humiliated Strauss in public and an event where Strauss believed that Oppenheimer had bad-mouthed him to Albert Einstein (Tom Conti – Derailed), which led to Strauss beginning a farcical campaign to Oppenheimer brought down from his prestigious posts. With Oppenheimer Nolan does what very few filmmakers do when making a biographical film – he shows all aspects of Oppenheimer’s life – the good and bad. Many filmmakers would have carefully avoided scenes such as the one where Oppenheimer nearly murders one of his lecturers or his attendance at Communist Party dinners, instead they would have tried to depict him as an angel. Even his extra-marital affair would have been swept under the carpet in an attempt to make him likable to the audience – but here Nolan bravely shows it all – warts and all. The result is a film where the audience feels like they have been told the whole story and can make up their own mind about Oppenheimer and his morals which leads to a pretty satisfactory state when they leave the cinema. Nolan’s brilliance also comes to the fore with the way he tells this story. A lot of the scenes are brief, the dialogue is snappy but the whole story is told and the result is a film that doesn’t feel like its three-hour runtime. The short scenes keep the audience’s interest up and that is one of the true keys to making this film work. Then there is of course the amazing sequence that depicts the night that the American Armed Forces get the chance to test Oppenheimer’s nuclear bomb. Of course anyone that knows anything about world history knows how that sequence is going to end but Nolan has written and directed it in such away that anybody watching it is sitting on the edge of their seat as the suspense level goes through the ceiling. Be warned your heart will race so much during those few minutes that you will feel like you are having a heart attack. Then there are the brilliant acting performances throughout the film. Cillian Murphy is spectacular as Oppenheimer, so good in fact that it is going to take something pretty special to not see him walk home with a Best Actor award at the Oscars next year. Likewise an unrecognisable Robert Downey Jnr. is a standout as the film’s villain and he should perhaps be making some space on his mantle piece for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar. With those two actors bringing their A-Game it would be very easy to over-look two other stunning performances in Oppenheimer. Matt Damon puts in a mature performance as an military officer who is often in two-minds about Oppenheimer while Florence Pugh is at her amazing best playing the flawed Jean Tatlock. Her scenes of mental anguish are a great reminder to Hollywood that Pugh is more than just a blockbuster actress.  There is no easier way to say it than Oppenheimer is a masterpiece. This brilliantly written and stunningly directed film allows its cast to put in the performances of their career and the result is a film that for generations will go down as a ‘must see’ film. It is safe for everybody to forget Tenet because Christopher Nolan has once again reminded audiences why he is one of the greatest directors of our generation. Master filmmaker Christopher Nolan (Inception) has taken no short cuts and come up with a tension filled, intriguing look at how the world was changed irrevocably. The first atomic bomb, named Little Boy, was dropped on Hiroshima on 6th August, 1945. The second, known as Fat Man, fell on Nagasaki three days later. But as much as the film deals with the consequences of those actions, Oppenheimer spends a great deal of time in the lead up to the bombs being released. His intellectual rigour was highly sought and he landed a job at a prestigious college run by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). Strauss would become chairman of the US Atomic Agency Commission. Groves had overseen construction of the Pentagon. He was charged with directing the top-secret Manhattan Project, involving the development of the atomic bomb. The intent was to end WWII sooner rather than later. So, Groves enlisted Oppenheimer and built a small town for him in a remote part of New Mexico. That enabled the latter and his team to carry out their work in isolation. There are so many threads and characters here. Three hours is a long time, but Nolan doesn’t waste a frame. Each scene is another piece of a highly political and, at times, deeply personal puzzle. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. Alternating imagery in colour and black and white, Hoyte van Hoytema’s evocative cinematography draws in the audience to the cat and mouse game at play. Ludwig Göransson’s arresting score adds another stratum to the anxiousness evident throughout. A phenomenal cinematic achievement, Oppenheimer is undoubtedly the film of the year. Surely Oscars await.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," Summer movie season heats up this weekend with the arrival of Christopher Nolan’s biopic Oppenheimer, adapted from the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by authors Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. But while there’s much to appreciate and plenty to praise, the sum is a hot mess. Nolan’s three-hour R-rated historical drama is squarely focused on adult audiences, mostly men, and opens against pop culture sensation Barbie and returning box office champion Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. The runtime means less screenings per day, but Oppenheimer has exclusive access to IMAX for several weeks, and trends show we currently lack enough premium theaters to meet high audience demand. So, the three-hour length is somewhat mitigated by the larger number of — and longer run in — IMAX locations. Barbie looks to top $150+ million worldwide through Sunday, while Mission: Impossible Dead Reckoning Part One is expected to finish somewhere near $400+/- million in global receipts after its sophomore weekend. Oppenheimer, meanwhile, is looking at right around $100 million. Older-skewing films have struggled lately, for the most part, especially tentpoles. Already this year, Disney’s Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny had a tough time appealing outside of its narrow target demos, and The Flash — which counted in part on nostalgic appeal for Michael Keaton’s return as Batman — was a disaster for Warner Bros. Discovery. Other high-profile 2023 films targeted mostly to adult audiences, such as 80 For Brady and Book Club: The Next Chapter, likewise had difficulty winning over viewers. Even Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning, which is performing well and earned a series-best opening, still came in under expectations and needs a good hold this weekend to prove it can sustain a long-legged run and benefit from generous international returns like its predecessors. So we’ll see whether Oppenheimer can please its target audience enough to earn good enough word of mouth to drive strong business and break into other demographics besides primarily middle-aged white men. With a film this long and of this sort, everything relies heavily on word of mouth and reviews. If reviews are bad, it needs overwhelmingly great word of mouth to do better than just a respectable first wave of audiences on opening weekend. If reviews are good, it needs at least very good audience word of mouth to overcome the portion of potential viewers who do care about buzz and reviews, who will show up at theaters this weekend and ask themselves, “What will I see? Hmm, which one is supposed to be good?” and recall what they heard from friends/family and what they saw on Rotten Tomatoes. Luckily for Nolan and Universal Pictures, so far reviews are highly positive. The Cinemascore will tell us how audiences feel, and the combo of the two should paint a fairly clear picture at least for the short term. A B+ grade will suggest weak support in its most enthusiastic viewers — opening weekend fans and those who show up because they were inspired by the buzz and marketing — and thus I’d expect a disappointing overall showing for the film at the end of its box office run. An A or A+ is what everyone involved in the picture most wants to hear, and would suggest a run similar perhaps to Nolan’s previous picture Dunkirk, another historic true story that earned widespread acclaim and is the filmmaker’s greatest achievement to date. A grade of A- is the hardest to parse here, as it could swing either way and would largely depend on how international audiences react to the picture. I suspect it will perform well in certain countries, far worse in others, and might not even screen in some markets. For now, it’s hard for me to say where I think the results will wind up, because my reaction to Oppenheimer is different from most other critics, apparently. Oppenheimer is ambitious and includes many mesmerizing, often brilliant moments, but those moments cannot sustain themselves nor find common ground as a single compelling narrative or perspective. Despite seemingly global and even cosmic themes, it winds up feeling decidedly contained and restricted, eyes cast downward, abandoning any visionary search for higher meaning behind the processes of science or politics. The marketing implies this is the story of the USA’s creation of the atomic bomb during World War II, and much mystery and buzz surrounds how Nolan depicts the eventual successful test of the atom bomb. Which would indeed have been a great story to tell, especially with hints that Nolan’s movie was a sort of “mad scientist” version of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the bomb. And in certain moments — far too few and largely restricted to brief early scenes , as it turns out — the film takes on an expressionist, surrealist quality when giving us early glimpses into Oppenheimer’s fascination with quantum theory and its implications. However, while it’s technically true that the film contains and returns constantly to a generally clinical presentation of scientific highlight moments during the creation of secretive Los Alamos, the main stories are not the bomb. Los Alamos is the backdrop against which the three main stories are told — his romantic life and affairs, the post-war attempts by his enemies to get his security clearance revoked, and an even later period of time when Lewis Strauss faced Congressional hearings to confirm him for a presidential cabinet position and his history of collaboration and conflict with Oppenheimer was a central focus. Too much screen time (relatively speaking) is dedicated to either Oppenheimer’s romantic and sexual relationships, in which women are portrayed as unreasonable, histrionic, mentally ill, and/or incapable of appreciating/accepting the demands and pressures he was under. Even the few women in the cast who aren’t Oppenheimer’s romantic interests or affairs — specifically, women on the team at Los Alamos — get little to say or are used to present positions and assertions framed as naive or overly simplistic compared against the turmoil and more complicated, serious considerations and burdens of “the great man.” It feels like a series of “this happened, and then this happened,” scenes collecting events from his life to form some sort of collage, with the parts then mixed into random orders and competing stories, all represented in different ways — more modern moments are black and white, older events in traditional “dramatic period piece” style, and mid-era events a starker almost sizzling representation of 1960s or 1970s newsreel. I can appreciate using different approaches to distinguish different eras and/or to try to fit the feel of those particular times, but it feels like either the decisions were made at random or — and I’m not sure if this would be better or worse, depending on how much you do or don’t agree with any of the film’s various competing perspectives — to intentionally present Strauss’ storyline in absolute black-and-white terms, present the hearings against Oppenheimer as conspiratorial and too literally glaring in their hypocrisy, and to present the Los Alamos backstory in a gentler, reverent manner. Perhaps Nolan’s attempt here is to create a cinematic representation of Oppenheimer’s life story that replicates quantum theory in certain regards — mixing up the timelines and jumping between them unequally and unpredictably (including because the editing is at times clipped and jarring), using varying and contrasting color and photographic techniques, switching between his more straightforward classic filmmaking approaches and almost experimental methods of photography and sound and editing (especially in the first act, and then later during a few climactic bomb-related sequences), and having storylines that converge and diverge sometimes in sync and other times at random. Is this Nolan’s expression of time existing at all moments simultaneously, so to speak? Is this how the chaos and confusion and mystery of quantum theory looks when distilled through artistry of filmmaking and representing someone who dedicated their life to quantum pursuits? Hard to say, because if not then he merely adapted a biography and attempted to include too many threads that each might’ve held its own appeal but which don’t fit together well in the form he’s created here, which would be a failure of adaptation. If so, though, then he attempted to adapt a biography by including so many threads that each held its own appeal and which fit together haphazardly and chaotically on the screen but which are still all part of the same lived life, and all of this chaos and all of those various threads are part of the larger story revolving around the central axis that is the introduction of nuclear weapons to our world. That this is both a remarkable scientific achievement and a potential guarantee that humanity is doomed, then, would speak profoundly to the issues that plagued Oppenheimer in this telling and represent humanity’s nature to make miraculous discoveries and then learn all of the wrong lessons from them. Sadly, Oppenheimer doesn’t rise to the occasion in the latter regard, if that was the intent. And the biggest problem is that none of the rest of the story — especially the shallow presentation of his affairs, a related tragedy, and the much-reported sex scenes and nudity — are frankly remotely as interesting as the Los Alamos stuff. Every few scenes at Los Alamos, the story suddenly jumps to either the small room in which Oppenheimer is subjected to hours of questioning and character assassination, or a large Congressional chamber where we witness questions and answers during the confirmation process. How much time do you think you want to spend watching a detailed cinematic rendering of either of those things? Well, your answer better be, “Hours of both!” because that’s what Oppenheimer has in store for you. The sex and nudity is both grossly overstated in the media, and yet also totally unnecessary to the point those scenes not only add nothing to the film or our understanding of Oppenheimer — or the relationships, or the subtexts, literally nothing is served by the nudity or sex scenes. Indeed, during one scene of nudity and sex, the audience openly laughed at the unintentionally humorous absurdity of the moment. If you were to break up Oppenheimer into three distinct parts (as you easily could), each of the three — Los Alamos, the security clearance investigation, and the Congressional confirmation hearings — each feels like it could and perhaps should be its own film, or own chapter in a longer miniseries. And each storyline feels as if it were made by a different filmmaker with different ideas and intentions. If Oliver Stones’ film JFK had lacked a singular focused narrative point and perspective, if it focused mostly on exposition during meetings and instead of a sweeping narrative felt constrained and so grounded it seemed to be wearing lead shoes, if the more experimental moments were exaggerated even more, and if it was comprised of the most boring scenes and often the least relevant. And imagine if it has sex and nudity but as clinical, cold, and emotionless as possible, not to mention out of place and unnecessary to the point of distraction — the hero and his wife discussing the case except they’re naked, or having sex but they’re also in court. The film’s political sensibilities are also all over the map, seeming at times to represent one perspective only to shrug it off in favor of something else, yet all the while insisting to have no perspective at all really. It’s not even necessary the lack of particular position so much as the disinterested vacillating that’s really the problem. The end result is a film that wants us to sense its importance right from the start, and which constantly tries to remind us of its high-minded history and implications that include nothing less than an existential threat to human existence, but which feels like it says very little and means none of it. It’s a movie about Oppenheimer and several things that happened to him, some of it engrossing, some of it interesting enough for a magazine article, and much of it not worth paying to sit through three hours to experience. All of those complaints said, the performances are spectacular. Cillian Murphy absolutely deserves Oscar consideration, and Robert Downey Jr. is so masterful you can literally forget you're watching one of the most famous and recognizable stars of the modern era. Emily Blunt deserved far more chances to shine in the film, but when she finally gets the opportunity she delivers one of the film's most satisfying emotional moments (of which there are very few). Matt Damon has fun and provides welcome humor at times, while Florence Pugh does her utmost with a role too thinly written and uncompromising in its painfully accusatory portrayal. Any given scene might be good or even great, many extended sequences are wonderfully realized, and it almost always looks gorgeous. But Oppenheimer underwhelms, from its overall inability to tell a coherent story to its lack of reason for us to invest in any of these people’s personal stories. The atomic test, which should be one of the highlights at least visually and emotionally, is mostly just the trailer shots except longer, and as soon as the sequence ended I was perplexed and wondered, “Was that it?” Not that I just wanted a big CGI nuclear explosion — I understand what this film is meant to be and I know all of the arguments and points made about how and why war and destruction and armageddon shouldn’t be casually treated as entertainment, and why a would-be morality tale shouldn’t glamorize or glorify nuclear holocaust as an “achievement.” But the moment, including actual restored and enhanced footage, could and should easily convey the dread and large-scale impression of absolute extinction — and the reactions of Oppenheimer and others witnessing it — can add to these themes (the film includes a few nods in this direction post-test, just not as much as I expected). This is the central moment of Oppenheimer’s life, it’s why we speak his name today and why this movie exists and why his warning reverberate. So I just feel it should’ve been a more central moment in the film, instead of getting less screen time than and roughly equal emotional representation as his love life. I am a huge fan of Nolan’s work, regardless of whatever criticisms I’ve offered over the years. I fully expected Oppenheimer to blow me away and be one of my favorite films of the year. I imagined it would be on my top 10 list for 2023 and one of the primary contenders on my list of Best Picture nominees. Instead, I’m disappointed and would have a tough time sitting through Oppenheimer again. Oppenheimer is Nolan’s weakest film to date, and a sharp contrast to his perfectly ambitious and complex vision in Dunkirk. Still, if getting Dunkirk, Interstellar, and Inception means we sometimes get flawed efforts like Oppenheimer that might include glimpses of greatness, then I’m forever grateful he keeps reaching.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 21, 2023"," Finally, Robert Downey, Jr. dazzles. Matt Damon gives a strong performance. It is a fascinating in-depth look that deserves all the Academy Awards it will win. I knew Dr. Edward Teller and he referenced the bombing of Hiroshima when replying to a question I asked him.  J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) was a brilliant Jewish chemist and physicist working on and developing the core structure of quantum mechanics. He was also, controversially, a “fellow traveler” of the Communist Party of the United States. Oppenheimer was not a card-carrying member, but he did go to meetings, gave speeches and had many friends who were defiant members. His brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) and his brother’s wife Jackie (Emma Dumont) were active members. Oppenheimer believed in its fundamental principles. What director/writer Christopher Nolan does not show is the highly competitive, ruthless world of elite scientists. For Oppenheimer to have risen so fast being chosen by Lt. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as the scientific director of the top-secret Manhattan Project, would have ruffled the feathers of those who had more seniority and political clout than Oppenheimer. It did not matter if you had a P.H.D., everyone had at least one. What was important: Where you got your P.H.D., your field, and then, who headed your thesis committee. After running through those hurdles, how many peer-reviewed papers have you published?  Every scientist had one ultimate goal: A Nobel Prize. Oppenheimer’s Manhattan Project even had a Nobel Prize winner, Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). What was the dynamics of so many divas? Oppenheimer’s intimate circle included his longtime friend Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), UC Berkeley colleague Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) and Hungarian Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). The dominant rivalry was between Oppenheimer and the colorful, deliberately rude Teller, who proposed the more extreme thermonuclear weapon (H-bomb) be created instead of an atomic bomb. Along with his appointment, Oppenheimer had a town built in Los Alamos. He then traveled extensively to hire the best scientists, with their families, to move to Los Alamos. He built houses, a school, a park, and everything that was needed to be a self-sufficient town. He had a great deal of power. Only when everyone was assembled did Oppenheimer reveal the purpose: They would create a bomb that would end World War ll.
 There was never a philosophical or theoretical approach to developing the bomb. They knew the amount of area that would be affected and the damage that would be done. They made an estimate regarding the number of civilians that would be killed. Against protocol, Oppenheimer even demanded his communist brother Frank join the team.
 Nolan shows Oppenheimer tormented over the devastation that he knew would be caused. He struggled with what he created, but he took the praise and glory. However, Nolan never shows the effects of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That would have compromised our feelings for the guilt-ridden Oppenheimer. As noted by Groves, $2 billion dollars was spent creating Oppenheimer’s world. Success was expected. Oppenheimer famously quoted from the Bhagavadgita: 'now, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.’ You can take that quote in several ways. I doubt that Oppenheimer was - in my opinion – near-suicidal – of achieving this world-changing event. It was no surprise. Immediately after the successful test explosion, he celebrated. Nolan sets up Oppenheimer’s fall by his Oval Office meeting with President Harry Truman (Gary Oldham). Oppenheimer confesses to Truman: ""I feel I have blood on my hands.” Accounts differ as to the exact words spoken, but historians agree that the comment infuriated the president. “Blood on his hands; damn it, he hasn’t half as much blood on his hands as I have. You just don’t go around bellyaching about it,” Truman said, according to the book, Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center by Ray Monk. Truman also called Oppenheimer a “cry-baby scientist” and said, “I don’t want to see that son of a bitch in this office ever again.” Soon Oppenheimer spoke out against nuclear weapons insulting all the scientists and the public who had lauded him. He embarrassed President Truman. Was this why the worm turned, and Oppenheimer’s career was brutally eviscerated?  In 1947, after leaving LANL, Oppenheimer accepted an offer by Strauss to take up the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. The position came with astonishing perks: A yearly salary of $20,000, a rent-free 17th-century manor with a cook and groundskeeper surrounded by 265 acres of woodlands. Eventually Strauss regretted his largess. He thought Oppenheimer was a Soviet spy and felt he was a threat to America. Strauss summoned Oppenheimer to his office and told him his top-security clearance had been revoked. Oppenheimer demanded a hearing to defend himself against the charges. His chief interrogator, AEC’s special counsel, Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), called many of Oppenheimer’s colleagues who discredited him. Teller’s testimony was the most damaging.  Oppenheimer’s life was spread open revealing controversial details: His close relationship with card-carrying communist Chevalier who he lied to protect and a night with his troubled ex-fiancée, communist Tatlock, (Florence Pugh) while married to Kitty (Emily Blunt). Only a few of his colleagues defended him. With the accusation of espionage already decided, Oppenheimer lost his position on the Atomic Energy Commission's advisory board. Nolan’s film is extraordinary cinema. Murphy holds the center showing the public agony Oppenheimer immediately felt after seeing what the atomic bomb caused. Was he a self-involved victim tormented with his fame? He became a historical figure in his lifetime then attempted to sabotage the work he had engineered. However, his morality stopped when dealing with the women in his life. Regardless of his emotional suffering, few of his colleagues agreed with him.
 The film’s length is justified by not skipping over Oppenheimer’s complex life. The cast supporting Murphy are all at their finest, giving career best performances. Much has been written about this being Nolan’s first foray into sexually explicit content. Many directors shy away from this in their films. Nolan gives Pugh and Murphy a sensual scene showing off his talent in exploring this subject.",POSITIVE

"Jul 21, 2023"," With the successful detonation of the world’s first nuclear weapon in 1945, J. Robert Oppenheimer ushered in the creation of a new realm — an atomic world full of grave questions and even more worrying answers. Christopher Nolan‘s viscerally anticipated account of that complicated figure, the aptly titled Oppenheimer, takes on a similar effect, ushering in a new form of blockbuster biopic. It not only breathtakingly marries the sonic with the visual but makes its true spectacle an explosive volley of deeply indicting conversations — an epic that unfolds more as a brainy slow-burn than an outright explosion. Oppenheimer is a deeply interrogative character study and a sprawling historical document that unleashes its most incendiary blows when its scorching depiction of political overreach takes precedence over the race for atomic armament. As it tracks the exceptional mind who directed the Manhattan Project to build the bomb that ended World War II, our subject is methodically vilified for vocalizing earned concerns that contradict America’s arms-race mentality. Nolan is a filmmaker who has unequivocally earned his stripes for his visual mastery of the medium rather than his skills as a cinematic dramatist. His sheer command of spectacle and style has dominated many a year’s film discourse, and that’s very much the case here. Yet, with Oppenheimer, he crafts a science epic that is just as deafening in its quiet moments as its loud ones. The film is best described as a thicket of captivating conversations, and though it can threaten to drag — especially in scenes featuring mid-century men engaged in heated, deeply complicated conversations about quantum mechanics — Nolan gives them immense force with his signature chronological interweaving. He laces the film with two separate, utterly absorbing Washington hearings, one for Dr. Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and one for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). At first, they contrastingly bubble in the background, but they slowly consume the narrative, completely occupying the final act. Moreover, there is an abundance of key, emotionally affecting discussions that continue to develop as they are revisited. One such discussion is a moving conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) that gracefully explores the consequences of scientific achievement and concludes with a sorrowful impeachment of America’s propensity to create and then destroy its heroes. The chronological maze cements a film that not only tests its audiences but is aggressively messy, creating an experience that feels both lost and very methodical. That messiness quickly becomes the key to its sprawling formula. Shifting periods and conversations at the drop of a single word, each gives force to the next discourse regardless of its place in the timeline of events. It’s a mad concoction that is as dizzying as it is captivating, cementing a masterwork that is incredibly difficult to nail down in just one viewing and begging to be poured over for years to come as it incites re-evaluations of its profoundly ill-defined protagonist. The twisting, labyrinthine structure is thoroughly rewarded by the breathtaking centerpiece that is the 1945 “Trinity” atomic bomb detonation test in New Mexico, which makes way for the historically devastating bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The fallout crowns Oppenheimer as a national hero despite the acidic moral reservations that mark Murphy’s vivid, sunken visage. These internalized ethical qualms play out as heart-wrenching, surreal visions of blinding light and ash that engulf a conflicted Oppenheimer as he slowly reckons with the muddled line between good and evil. The film’s subsequent transition to the sickening smear tactics of the McCarthy era is viscerally captured in a relentless stream of dialogue-driven vignettes that painstakingly trace each betrayal and act of loyalty. Nolan deftly builds toward a powerful crescendo that mournfully basks in the humiliation of Oppenheimer and his combative Wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), at the hands of the vindictive Strauss. As a result, it’s a three-hour experience that rarely lulls, expertly employing each moment of its runtime to reinforce the next until its ear-splitting, heartbreaking conclusion. This is all underpinned by Ludwig Göransson’s thundering, wall-to-wall score that sits at a perfect crossroads between goosebump-inducing and woefully elegiac. In a never-ending ensemble of giants, Downey stands tall as the Machiavellian Strauss, who poisons the most influential of public officials against the all-too-honest Oppenheimer. Downey nails both the seething contempt under his clean-cut persona and the torrent of rage that spills out in a great late scene. Murphy’s soft-spoken yet expressive portrait is mesmerizing, to say the least. His pale, piercing gaze is reflective of his wily determination and his moral naivety, which cathartically gives way to a palpable level of inner torment when he realizes the extent of the power he has bestowed upon mankind. His academic peers, Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Isidore Rabi (David Krumholtz), and the smug Edward Teller (a great Benny Safdie) all make a memorable impression. Matt Damon’s Major Leslie Groves, who oversees the nuclear development project, strikes a perfect balance between humor and sternness. His implicit respect for Oppenheimer’s intelligence unearths a wonderfully moving duality. Blunt’s role is never relegated to that of a supportive spouse. Instead, she surges with conviction, sorely unapologetic about the life she has led, especially her past ties to the American Communist Party. There is also a bevy of small but significant roles, the most notable of which being Casey Affleck’s ruthlessly inquisitive intelligence officer and Jason Clarke’s viciously accusatory Government Counsel. That’s not even mentioning turns from Josh Peck, Alden Ehrenreich, David Dastmalchian, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, and Gary Oldman. Oppenheimer is a wholly distinct entry in Nolan’s canon, one that is incredibly talkie and thoroughly embedded in a sweeping sense of gravitas. It’s fueled by an overabundance of close-ups of faces that struggle to reckon with who they are and ones that have succumbed to what others think they are. It’s an incredibly mournful epic that uses its philosophical and emotional weight to exert its hold over viewers and utterly absorb them into its all-encompassing vision. It’s messy, flawed, and, at times, overwrought. But then again, so was Oppenheimer. It’s rare to find an epic that embraces its central figure so holistically in its attempt to discover what kind of place in history he deserves for unleashing hell on earth. It’s messy, flawed, and, at times, overwrought. But then again, so was Oppenheimer.

"Jul 21, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” is unstuck in time. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, the film is a non-linear account of the life and times of one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century. But while “Oppenheimer” presents a scattering of moments from across J. Robert Oppenheimer’s lifetime, the movie (based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin) is mostly filtered through two main events: the building of the atomic bomb and the 1954 security hearing that called into question his patriotism. Thus, what is arguably Oppenheimer’s moment of greatest triumph is juxtaposed against his moment of greatest humiliation. Nolan has become increasingly obsessed with time since “Inception,” whether it’s the non-linear storytelling of “Dunkirk” or the reversed time-flow oddity of “Tenet.” That devotion serves him well in “Oppenheimer,” for it is not a standard biopic, mostly due to that cross-cutting of time periods and stories. It would be easy to present Oppenheimer’s life as a more linear story, but by showing the interconnectedness of our own lives — how the past is linked to the future, and how our destiny is reflected back in our present — “Oppenheimer” becomes a much more captivating film. And it is a very captivating film. “Oppenheimer” is easily one of the best movies of the year so far. A lot of that comes from its brilliant sense of contradiction. It’s shot on as wide a lens as possible, but it’s mostly comprised of close-ups of people’s faces, which makes it epically intimate. It’s made up of conversations, testimony and debate, yet they feel as riveting as any action sequence, especially when coupled with the amazing score by Ludwig Göransson. It’s a tale of progress told in a scattershot manner, and though the movie centers around the greatest destructive force known to mankind, it concentrates on interpersonal relationships. The gorgeous visuals by DP Hoyte van Hoytema, the impeccable sound design by Richard King and the impressive editing by Jennifer Lame come together to create something stirringly grandiose yet delicately intimate. This is assisted greatly by an amazing cast who do some of their best work. Cillian Murphy is the obvious standout at the center of it all, playing Oppenheimer as an aloof egotist who is humbled and whose wings are eventually clipped. There is an intensity and a lingering sadness to the performance that alternates in prominence depending on what era of Oppenheimer’s life we are in. Matt Damon also shines as the wry general who oversees The Manhattan Project, trying to wrangle all the scientific geniuses without ever taking his mind off his mission of winning the war. Additionally, while are many key supporting players in the cast, and they all get a moment or two to shine, my favorite is easily David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, a fellow physicist who acts a bit as the conscience of the project. Speaking of contradictions, this is where that sprawling cast of well-known faces becomes a bit of an issue. It’s pretty distracting when Casey Affleck or some other well-known actor suddenly appears on screen, taking audiences out of the movie for a bit. They all do good work, but it’s still a jarring moment when someone famous pops in for a few scenes and then disappears for the rest of the film. Much like Los Alamos itself, “Oppenheimer” has attracted some of the best in the field, but it can create a bit of discombobulation. The other issue is that part of the third act drags a bit as Nolan underscores multiple points repeatedly. It’s not that these aren’t important aspects of Oppenheimer’s life but simply that their emotional resonance diminishes the more they are harped upon. This leads to a bit of stagnation until it picks back up for a marvelous and powerful conclusion. It’s not enough to truly mar the movie, but it’s an odd pacing issue that isn’t present anywhere else. Minor issues aside, Nolan has crafted a singular piece of cinema about a very singular persona. Oppenheimer was a man who genuinely helped shape the 20th century, and yet even with his life laid bare in books and this film, he remains a bit of an enigmatic presence. The real-life scientist was ravaged by The Red Scare, but it appears that he had already been defeated by his greatest accomplishment, collaborating with some of the brightest minds of his time to create one of the most horrible moments in history. And it’s that spirit of contradictory elements, along with a brilliant and unconventional approach that yields some mesmerizing scenes and tremendous performances, that makes “Oppenheimer” such a triumph.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is an epic-sized biography about a complex historical figure. Unlike anything the director has made, the film doesn’t rely on mind-bending scenarios or stunning special effects to astound his audience into submission. His production’s greatest effect is the central performance by longtime collaborator Cillian Murphy, who delivers an articulate and immersive turn as J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb. That designation never pleased Oppenheimer, who felt a magnetic pull toward the discovery and use of nuclear weaponry, both as a brilliant quantum physicist and a Jewish man compelled to end World War II. He lamented that his name was associated with a weapon that left hundreds of thousands dead from the initial detonation to the lasting effects of radiation and cancer. And he deplored using the bomb, even though he believed humanity needed this example to stop all future wars. Nolan’s take on the character has all the flaws, disharmonies, and intensity of David Lean’s titular character from Lawrence of Arabia (1962), except Oppenheimer doesn’t quite measure up to that film in terms of scope. Marked by political maneuvering and dialogue-heavy writing, Nolan’s script, for once, doesn’t over-explain what’s happening and why. He delivers an equivocal film about a paradoxical character, and he refuses to answer every question about him.  Nolan’s script draws from the 2005 biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Although the narrative structure defies linearity, the proceedings gradually take shape and orbit around two official hearings: The most immediate to the protagonist places Oppenheimer in the throes of a panel reviewing his security clearance in the years after World War II, requiring him to recollect and remark on many of his life choices and vague associations with the Communist Party. The other involves a hearing to assess Strauss’ application to President Dwight Eisenhower’s cabinet. Shot in black-and-white, Nolan insists the latter thread provides an objective, factual account, whereas the color scenes belong to Oppenheimer’s subjectivity. The narrative devices, combined with the switches from monochrome to color, recall Oliver Stone’s work in the 1990s, with particular allusion to 1995’s Nixon—both Stone’s film and Nolan’s film are about a historically divisive character rapt by personal failings and landmark victories, conveyed with a blend of subjective evidence and objective truths. Given the film’s use of official inquiries, it’s perhaps strange, then, that Nolan has boasted about shooting the movie in IMAX format and offering a few 70mm nationwide screenings. When properly projected, a 70mm print looks better than the clearest digital projector, offering more detail, brighter colors, and immersive scale. However, celluloid projection is a dying art, requiring the projectionist’s skill and attention. Evidenced by the press screening of Oppenheimer in the Twin Cities, the projectionist couldn’t be bothered to eliminate projector wobble and couldn’t tell that the image was out of focus ever-so-slightly. I suspected as much throughout, asking myself whether I needed a new prescription for my astigmatism or if something was off about the projected image. Yet, when the title finally appeared against a black background at the end, revealing soft edges on the lettering, the problem was unmistakable. This does not reflect poorly on the film, of course; it’s just an observation that, despite Nolan attempting to deliver the most premium cinematic experience for his latest, his efforts may be undone because few projectionists today know how to handle celluloid projectors. Nolan’s idol, Stanley Kubrick, known for his letters to projectionists and obsessively overseeing the quality of his prints, would have fumed over such an exhibition. Hopefully, your viewing experience is better. But I digress.  In a move reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino’s The Hateful Eight (2015), another film projected on 70mm, much of Nolan’s film takes place in enclosed spaces—classrooms, Los Alamos labs, cramped conference rooms, hearing rooms teeming with people. These would seem an incongruous choice for a format often associated with grand cinematic epics, but the effect treats Oppenheimer’s face as a vast panorama of detail and flinty emotions. The exception is the scopic Trinity Test sequence, where Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema zoom over the New Mexico landscape to find a skeletal tower from which the test bomb will drop. Nolan builds to this moment for the first two hours of Oppenheimer, implanting dread about the possibility that the test may set off a chain reaction that could ignite the atmosphere. But like Oppenheimer, General Groves (Matt Damon), who oversees the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos for the US military, insists they take a risk on what fellow physicist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) believes is a minor probability. Building to this sequence, and beyond it, Nolan and Lame’s editing feels propulsive, often leaping to the next image in the middle of a line in a manner that sometimes feels disruptive to the visual rhythm, though the winding, lyrical music by Ludwig Göransson holds the film together.  Although most will enter Oppenheimer thinking the climactic moment arrives with the first successful test of an atomic bomb, Nolan has another hour to investigate his characters, their political and personal drives, and question the conventional justifications for dropping the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki—supported by Strauss, who suggests that Japan would have never surrendered. Perhaps because Oppenheimer wants to maintain control over his invention, perhaps because he wants to preserve his power, he doesn’t speak up too loudly against using the bomb or developing a postwar arsenal to protect the US from the Soviet Union. A scene where he meekly appeals to Truman (Gary Oldman) about the dangers of an arms race earns him nothing but mockery from the brash POTUS. But then, Nolan’s film takes place in a world before digital video could give you real-time access to war footage. Oppenheimer and the officials who decide to bomb Japan (in a cynical scene that finds James Remar’s Henry Stimson resolving not to bomb his favorite vacation spot, Kyoto) could do so without having to witness the destruction first-hand. Still, Oppenheimer imagines Americans with singed skin peeling off their faces, their bodies left in ashen husks, like the remains of those dead in Pompeii. However, the politicians show no remorse or humanity, and even if they could see the horrific effects of the bomb, Nolan leaves the impression that their narrow-minded urge to protect their power would no doubt overcome any pesky humanist reservations.  Even though much of Oppenheimer entails the life-and-death stakes surrounding the bomb, this is a character study first and foremost, so Nolan delves into Oppenheimer’s personal relationships with colleagues and lovers. Nolan doesn’t have much interest in the women in Oppenheimer’s life (and writing women has never been his strong suit), giving them little dimension apart from their role in the protagonist’s life, which, in turn, reflects the film’s subjective perspective and thus Oppenheimer’s view of women—secondary to science. Florence Pugh has a small but impassioned role as his mistress, Jean Tatlock, a character reduced to a fiery communist sexpot. Emily Blunt serves better as his wife, Kitty, who drinks to escape her stifling domestic drudgery. Kitty’s potential is merely glimpsed in a late scene when she verbally spars with a lawyer (Jason Clarke), who attempts to discredit her husband, though she has every reason not to defend his character. Nolan doesn’t look too deeply into their relationship except to show Kitty’s tough skin emerge whenever her husband is vulnerable. Elsewhere, Nolan populates his cast with a distracting number of familiar faces in minor roles, far too many to list out, though Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Matthew Modine, and David Dastmalchian leave an impression.  Murphy’s performance is marvelous, comparable to Peter O’Toole’s in the aforementioned Lawrence of Arabia. An ever-magnetic presence since his breakout in 28 Days Later (2002), the actor replicates Oppenheimer’s severe, almost fervent eyes that seem to bulge with feverish brilliance. Like T.E. Lawrence, Oppenheimer is driven toward actions he intellectually abhors, and he’s quite naive to the political consequences, but he is compelled by his hubris and obsessive need to know if the fractured images of atoms firing in his mind can be achieved. Another similarity to Lawrence is that Oppenheimer dabbles in identities, shifting from the role of a physicist to a politician freely, just as Lawrence alternated between a British soldier and an Arabian desert warrior, fully inhabiting each role. Oppenheimer even tries on communism for a time, leading to many questions about his loyalties during the Red Scare. Much of the hearing into his security clearance attempts to unpack why Oppenheimer associated with left-wing causes or had communist friends, and the answers remain unclear if circumstantial and too complicated to distill. “Nobody knows what you believe,” Teller observes somewhat pointedly. “Do you?” Oppenheimer is unquestionably Nolan’s most intricate character to date, and Murphy brings him to life in a three-dimensional performance that will be what the film is remembered for.  Oppenheimer might drag in the final act, but the structure will reward another viewing, as most Nolan films do. Nolan’s general perspective won’t challenge the audience, as he seems sympathetic to scientists like Oppenheimer, who has the greater good in mind yet remains a thorny individual, and he admonishes politicians like Strauss, who cannot see beyond their self-obsession and personal ambition. Fortunately, Nolan never reduces his film to political message-making, as many unsubtle films today do in our politically demarcated culture. What’s curious is that the film doesn’t play like summer blockbuster material, no matter how much Nolan wants to convince us of the story’s epicness. Rather, it’s a probing drama about a multifaceted individual, anchored by a stunning central performance. So the writer-director’s usual emotional distance aligns well with his subject, a man whose genius and perspective could not be summarized into a simple biographical portrait. Oppenheimer’s entangled identity provides a fascinating topic, and Nolan’s film focuses on the individual more than any other or the historical surroundings, leaving all else except Oppenheimer to feel secondary and occasionally underserviced. But like the best films about real-life figures, Oppenheimer is about the main character’s mass of psychological contradictions, challenging the audience to empathize and understand him without telling us how.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," You have to hand it to Christopher Nolan for convincing a major studio to spend $100m (USD) on a 3-hour long drama detailing the development of the atomic bomb and releasing it in the prime film season that is the US summer. Whilst the film itself will prove drastic counter-programming to its fellow ambitious release buddy, Barbie (long live “Barbenheimer”), audiences should be forewarned that a 3-hour examination on the atomic bomb under the direction of someone as intricate as Nolan is an experience as dense, complicated and mind-numbing as you may expect. There’s an almost Oliver Stone-like quality to the way Nolan has approached Oppenheimer, offsetting the bigness of his production with an internalised character study and a constant rotation of famous faces all making sure they earn their moment – however brief – in a film that’s predominantly about men talking. The titular Oppenheimer is that of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy, practically leaping into the early Oscar talk with his performance here), a theoretical physicist who found himself tasked with the development of the atomic bomb as World War II started to form in the early 1940’s.  Technical jargon with fellow, dysfunctional geniuses litter large portions of Nolan’s script (based off Kai Baird and Martin J. Sherwin‘s “American Prometheus”) as he forms his creative production team, whilst simultaneously conversing with Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., possibly the best he’s ever been), an Atomic Energy Commission figure, who will prove more foe than friend as the years eventually roll on. Oppenheimer’s focus remains solely on building the bomb for the best part of 3 years, recruiting scientists and military types – including Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, injecting much-needed energy into proceedings), a US Army Corps of Engineers officer who oversaw the construction of the Pentagon and was a major directive figure in the atomic bomb research project – and setting them up in New Mexico on a constructed plot dubbed “The Trinity Site”.  Their eventual creation is one of devastation, but the film itself is wise enough to never completely vilify Oppenheimer – he does plenty of that to himself – as he is essentially shut out by the government when wanting to speak his intentions for the legacy of the bomb itself. Oppenheimer‘s story structure ultimately proves something of a surprise.  As much as this is a film about the atomic bomb’s creation and the man behind it, it adopts a more political thriller temperament as it details the legal aftermath of its ramifications.  At three hours long it seems bizarre to note how much longer Oppenheimer could have been to fully detail its ingredients, as there are important figures in his life that feel remarkably short-changed – though because Oppenheimer’s focus is purely on creating the atomic bomb, this could perhaps be an intentional move on Nolan’s part to highlight everyone else’s insignificance. The two people in Oppenheimer’s life that feel undone by this structure are his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his lover, Jean (Florence Pugh).  It doesn’t help that these are the two sole female presences in the film – adding to the discourse that Nolan has never been the strongest at writing women – and Pugh, tragically, feels entirely underutilised – despite a committed performance – but Blunt manages to persevere through initial window dressing treatment.  The entanglement of these two women, as well as their communist ties, suggests its own narrative of depth and wealth, furthering the notion of just how much story Nolan had to work with, and that he perhaps aimed for too much inclusion across the board. Despite the overall underwhelming inclusion of both these women – it’s a shame both talented actresses aren’t afforded more – Oppenheimer still earns its length (as much as the 180 minutes is felt at times) as it breaks down its timeline in a pre and post-Trinity temperament; Nolan also toying with the film’s colour pallet to help differentiate, with Strauss and his complots shot in black-and-white, while Oppenheimer’s POV is presented in colour.  The Trinity mission presents Oppenheimer as more fresh-faced and (initially) hopeful as he prepares for what he believes will put him on the right side of history, creating a weapon that he assumes will end all wars, rather than enhance them.  Post-Trinity, with Oppenheimer visually aged (the makeup work on Murphy is flawless), sees him subjected to a private court hearing regarding the bomb, the specific choices made throughout the creation process, and his supposed ties to communism.  These sequences are some of the film’s strongest and most tense, with Jason Clarke a particular force as Roger Robb, a circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals, seeking to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance and damage his psyche in the process. At times, Nolan’s insistence on littering his film with familiar faces almost takes away character impact – similar to the “special guest star” mentality employed by David O. Russell in his last feature, Amsterdam – with Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett and Benny Safdie, to name a few, rearing their mugs throughout to varying degrees of success.  None of them are delivering bad performances, but there’s a certain level of distraction that comes with their weight when tied to a character of minimal exposure; this particularly in the case of Malek.  Perhaps, due to the dialogue-heavy nature of Oppenheimer as a film there’s a certain need to garner more attention from audiences, and recognisable actors assist with such a notion as some viewers may find the film’s frame of mind difficult to sit with. That being said, the teamwork on hand is impressive, and despite the serious star wattage it all fuses together to maintain a shine on Murphy, with his wide-eyed steeliness forever stealing focus.  J. Robert Oppenheimer doesn’t always exercise the best judgement – particularly when it comes to his sex life (which, for the record, is not presented in the explicit detail early reports had suggested) –  but it’s clear Nolan has a passion for both the man and his experience, and Murphy’s performance further expresses that sympathy across a complicated time in history. The legal arc of Oppenheimer is ironically when it’s at its best, as the government’s seemingly incessant need to discredit him allows the film to adopt a tense and emotional personality, something that it only comes close to emulating with the sequence of the bomb test itself.  Much has been discussed around Nolan’s statement that the recreation of the explosion was a practical effect, and it is indeed Oppenheimer‘s pièce de résistance, but as it arrives around the film’s 2-hour mark, the remaining hour has no choice but to one-up the aforementioned explosion, and it does so with conversational and reflective sequences that fuel the film’s psychological impact. Whilst I can’t deny I felt the film’s overall density and 3-hour length at times – and I believe a mini-series temperament would suit this story far more – there’s no taking away from Oppenheimer‘s impact as a piece of cinematic mastery.  Nolan continues to push the boundaries of feature storytelling in a way that transcends the flashy visuals he’s oft adhered to, here with a turbulent, immersive experience that speaks just as much to one man’s paranoia and blemishes as it does his untapped genius.

"Jul 20, 2023"," God bless Christopher Nolan. God bless him. This man has given us clever lil’ indies, gigantic effects spectacles, and three legendary Batman movies. He teamed up Robin Williams and Al Pacino. He folded Paris into a cube. He made everyone cry by making us watch Matthew McConaughey cry. He gave us fisticuffs between two guys who are the same guy moving in opposite directions through time. He made a contemporary war movie that was under two hours long. Sure, through his mission to perfect his craft he sometimes ends up getting in his own way, but this is only because he’s not about to settle for complacency. He’s always trying to grow, and as a result he has yet to release a film that isn’t a certified banger. Some are better than others, but every last one of them represents a step forward in craft and a leap forward in ambition. God bless this man. It’s only fitting that for his latest epic, he chose to profile J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man behind the atom bomb — the man who, per this excellent film — was never the type to do the math, but always the type to conceive something well beyond what anyone else could even begin to understand. One would assume that Nolan, like many creatives, sees a parallel here. Especially in the directing world. It’s not necessarily up to the director to know how to make an image, but they do need inspire their team of technicians and artists to see the final product in tandem. That said, the results of a director’s vision, unlike Mr. Oppy, don’t involve man harnessing the power of the sun in order to turn countless human beings into dust. Based on the novel American Prometheus, Oppenheimer follows the titular physicist from his appointment at the head of the Manhattan Project, all the way through his post-war years, during which the American government sought to brand him a communist in response to his vocal reluctance to be as gung-ho as the military industrial complex in proliferating a nuclear arsenal. It’s a complicated portrait of an undoubtedly complicated man, operating at an extremely complicated time. Nolan performs a sort of “greatest hits” reel in the film’s construction. You have the non-linear timeline of Memento/The Prestige, the Russian doll genre stacking of Inception, and the promise of at least one astonishing in-camera effects sequence a la Interstellar. But even with all of these influences, the bulk of the film is something rather new for Nolan: it’s mostly just people talking. There’s no footage of the final bombs being dropped, nor does the film dwell too long on its (absolutely fantastic) sequence depicting the initial test explosion. This is, for better and for worse, a biopic. Yet even though its energy is much more Good Night, and Good Luck than it is Pearl Harbor, the way its shot lends itself to the 70mm/IMAX format. As the long list of heavy hitters in the cast engage in a variety of bureaucratic discussions, it becomes clear how talented each player is. There’s room on a gigantic screen for subtlety, and the entire cast uses every inch they can get. Appropriate too, given the nature of the story. Without such nuanced performances and a large pallet upon which to draw them, how can an actor wear the paradox of ‘saving the world’ at the mere cost of moving us vastly closer to Armageddon without playing too broadly to the back row? It’s admittedly difficult to process the entirety of Oppenheimer in just a single viewing. There’s so much movie going on that it’s simply not possible to parse out the pros and cons in too meaningful a way. What I mean to say is that the biggest con: the final third of the movie, which focuses on a tension that exists between Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, the latter whom is seeking to destroy the former’s reputation while also preserving his own, feels a bit “after the fact.” It does indeed feel like an hour-long deflation which occurs after the mid-movie atomic bomb test, but I imagine this criticism will dull upon repeat viewings — after I’m no longer being taught how to watch the movie by the movie itself (another Nolan staple). Nonetheless, this material is still riveting in its own way, and ultimately serves the themes of the film. What are these themes? Well to single even ten out would be just a small chunk of what they’re getting at here, but for my money the most prominent is the notion that our heroes are only heroes through a certain lens. One can look at Oppenheimer and see a guy who ended WWII or the guy who gave humans the destructive power of the sun. We can look at the Manhattan Project itself as an altruistic attempt to beat our enemies at building a powerful weapon for which the science was just recently developed, or you can see it as Americans racing to be the sole possessors of God-like means of destruction. Was our decision to drop the bomb made in an earnest attempt to end the war? Or was it simply an advertisement of our new toys? A single scene in which a group of besuited, powerful men try to determine the target of the bomb is perhaps the best in the entire film at driving home this paradox of power. Every last one of them knows that countless innocent people are going to die. They also recognize that Pandora’s box is open — a bomb is going to be dropped. One of these soulless suits (James Remar!) states that Kyoto is too important to Japanese culture to lob a bomb at — a nice enough consideration — before lamenting that he’d hate to see it go since that’s where he and his wife celebrated their honeymoon. J. Robert Oppenheimer knows what he’s doing is dangerous, but does not stop. America knows it’s about to weakly justify something villainous, but does not stop. Why? Because everyone fears the potential situation that could manifest if they do stop. If Oppenheimer is the father of the Atomic Age, we must all recognize that it is an age where decisions are based as much in fear as they are in innovation. It’s scary, important stuff, and presented here it’s a breathless three-hour biographical epic (the highest praise I can give the film is that I did not leave the theater to pee). Due to its non-linear edit, the film gets to exist as a dense biopic and a ticking-clock thriller. Add to that a career best score by Ludwig Göransson and the brilliant lens of Hoyte Van Hoytema, and you’ve got an uncommonly hypnotic film that, even if you lose interest in a story sense, is sure to enrapture you in a technical one. It’s simple fate that this film will receive Oscar love come next year’s ceremony, all of it deserved, with a strong chance that Cillian Murphy will take home the gold with his searing, understated performance. Robert Downey Jr. will almost certainly be recognized as well — but make no mistake: every single performance across this stacked cast is deserving of recognition. From Emily Blunt’s deeply compelling portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer down to Macon Blair’s work as Oppy’s tenacious lawyer (he chews the scenery with Jason Clarke in a big way, basically declaring himself the heir apparent to Philip Seymour Hoffman), everyone recognizes the scope of the film and plays to it perfectly. Literally everyone. And this movie stars EVERYONE. I, for one, know that I’ll be seeking out multiple additional viewings of Oppenheimer, with at least one more being in a premium format. It’s a masterpiece of tone and craft that tells such a vast story that it’s impossible to take it all in in just one sitting. Luckily, it’s such an enjoyable, albeit dark film that it invites multiple viewings. It’s rare that a movie which clocks in at three hours makes you want to return to it right away, but here we are. My assumption is that the shaggier plot elements that felt somewhat extraneous will grow to feel essential, but even if they don’t, it still places Oppenheimer in a damn fine place.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Filmmaker Christopher Nolan is an incredible storyteller whose films have often bordered on the self-indulgent. He rewrote Bill Kinger and Bob Kane’s Batman lore extensively, let Christian Bale chew the scenery as the Caped Crusader, and made INCEPTION, DUNKIRK, and TENET a ton more confusing than they needed to be. Yet, in his newest film OPPENHEIMER, opening this weekend, Nolan has presented his most disciplined work to date. It’s crystal clear in its narrative and meaning, there’s not a wasted scene or line, and every actor is spot-on in this compelling true story of the scientist who gave 1945 America the atomic bomb. It’s not only the filmmaker’s truest masterpiece, one that is both breathtakingly epic and heartbreakingly intimate, but it’s going to be very hard to beat as the best movie of 2023. J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy) has always been a contradictory figure. Oppy, as he was known to friends and lovers, was a scientific genius, the theoretical physicist who figured out how a split atom could lead to a weapon of mass destruction to help America win WWII. Yet, for as brainy as the man was, Oppenheimer crossed many lines in the course of his career, suggesting questionable judgment. He incorporated political activism and Communist sympathizing into his college teaching even though it was forbidden by school bylaws. He had numerous affairs, often with colleagues, and developed quite a rep as a womanizer. And while he agreed to work for army bigwig Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) in the development of the weapon to end all wars, Oppy was at heart a strong pacifist. All of that is portrayed vividly in this masterful character study, and every shade and nuance of the man is captured thoroughly by a never-better Murphy. The film is framed by Oppenheimer’s testimony given to a special government panel in the 1950s which was set up as a kangaroo court to take away his security clearance. (The Feds soured on him as he decried America’s escalating arms race with the Soviets.) Using such a framing device allows Nolan to jump around here and there in the scientist’s biography and capture key moments in Oppenheimer’s life as both testimony and flashbacks. His fullest testimony concerns the years developing the atomic bomb out in the secluded desert terrain of Los Alamos, New Mexico, and it’s here where the story is at its most exciting. Nolan makes this segment crackle like a nerve-jangling thriller as the Americans are working as swiftly as possible to thwart the efforts of Germany. The stakes were high and the effect it had on all those at work in Los Alamos was enormous. Literally, Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists were tasked with winning the war for the United States and Nolan makes the tension of having to deliver such an atomic solution in record time utterly palpable. And Murphy carries the picture, being in easily 90% of the scenes. He bears a striking resemblance to Oppenheimer at times – similar in lanky physique and piercing blue eyes. There’s a haunted look to Murphy’s Oppy too – at times he looks skeletal, his eyes staring blanking, his gait slow and deliberate. This “destroyer of worlds,” at times, seems almost spectral. It makes the film all the more chilling. And indeed, the scientist did leave a lot of deathly damage in his wake. Early in the film, college student Oppenheimer tries to poison a bullying professor. Oppy also drives psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) to rash acts during their illicit sexual affair. Oppy burns bridges with former colleagues and ends friendships with those who disagree with him. He even tries to squelch the very arms race that he helped start. His life was filled with drama and, dare one say, devastating fallout. At times, his story feels almost like a horror movie, and Nolan even has composer Ludwig Goransson score it that way. The cast is ginormous, yet every single major player registers strongly. There are some surprise cameos too, but the standouts amongst all the superb supporting players are Pugh, Damon, Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s shrewd wife, David Krumholtz as longtime friend and scientist Isidor Isaac Rabi, and Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, a one-time ally of Oppenheimer’s who becomes his truest foil. Downey Jr is revelatory here, playing a villain as if to the manor born. At times, OPPENHEIMER resembles the Oliver Stone film JFK with its sprawling cast, detailed historical events, and all the various types of ‘looks’ of the cinematography to cover various moods and time periods. I particularly liked the lush, colorful 50s-style photography style that the director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema employs in the first hour of the film. The story is masterfully put together, blending scenes and moods fluidly, and showcasing not only award-worthy acting, writing, and direction, but production design, costuming, editing, and scoring as well. It may not surprise that Nolan takes the same anti-war POV that Oppenheimer ultimately came to after creating the monstrous device that he did. Such a stance makes the film all the more relevant for our modern times as too many fools today think a nuclear war is winnable. Nolan is using Oppenheimer’s story as the strongest of cautionary tales to stifle such misguided fantasies. Indeed, OPPENHEIMER is a political statement, but its potent message stands in tandem with the film’s exceptional artistry. It’s one of the most exciting and moving films you’ll see this year. Any year, for that matter.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," “Oppenheimer”: an American tragedy relayed as a time-slipping weft of memory and hurt in the form of the panic attack of all panic attacks: I, I, asked the questions of the universe, I, I, brought the world fire and for that they want to burn me, I, whole. For lack of a keener phrase, this is an intimate epic. “Brilliant counts for a lot,” Oppenheimer says, but it’s not everything in how a singular, neurotic mind marks its way through civilization—is he the most self-important man in history? “Actually important,” a character corrects. Nolan sees Oppenheimer as the artificer of the world we hold today, and what may be left of it if—when?—final fire is ultimately sparked. The naked “I” is also very much in the range of close-ups in 70mm on the big screen of the contours of the cheekbones of Cillian Murphy, his wide eyes widened further still by questions of theory, the turning, churning machinations of an improvident world, and always his desire—theory, the cigarettes that killed him, women. He is brought to bone: the arch of bone beneath the eye that nearly pierces flesh as it courses along the jaw, the uniform of extended pipe and wide-brimmed hat, and what a beautiful top coat that drapes his coat rack of a frame! (“I” is also literally naked as one of the figures of two lovers in a hotel room, draped over club chairs, Balthus figures hued with burnish.) Thirty-six hours after a first encounter is not much time to mull the implications, the patterning, the heft of “Oppenheimer”—which conveys with outer calm and inner fury the choices one makes for others and the choices made for oneself—even if it’s not the potential for an atom bomb with its legacy of potential world detonation at any instant. A lifetime, plus the life of every soul on earth.  Nolan insists that petty battles will persist, the same men who coldly conduct vendetta against J. Robert Oppenheimer are also those who retain the buttons and keys and those molecules of the fire of science, the stuff that cursed Prometheus. Bureaucrats tether men, not chain reactions. Oppenheimer: “a dilettante, a womanizer,” “a New Deal Democrat” empathizes with both atom and the working man. He bristles and thrives in the company of equally incandescent figures as they rush to have “The Gadget” before Hitler does, mostly men, who can read the pages scratched with diagrams and symbols as if it were music upon staves, that to their eyes is smashing and symphonic. Nolan’s prismatic telling comprises three solid hours of what some may take as mere bombast (and passages that could be described as bombastic calm)—with the kaleidoscope of Oliver Stone-like editing (calmed, somewhat) and Stone-style sparking star cameos (and multiple widescreen formats, originated in IMAX, some conveyed in black-and-white). Such inner turmoil, with musical velocity provided by the restlessly versatile, violin-violent score, the ether of Scandinavian music, by Swedish composer Ludwig Göransson (“Black Panther,” “Creed,” “Venom,” “Tenet”). Beyond faces, such faces, so gorgeously inhabited, and bursts of impassioned words, the telling is through dark rapture, historical moments dreamt as crisp, lucid beauty, succession of sounds, images and sensations, even in everyday settings—cinematic means, if you will. And also: emblems, particles, tumult, dazzling light plays and damning explosions and the bloody terror of it all: perception, if you will.  “Who would want to justify their whole life?” is a refrain, as are drops of rain that silently eddy on the surface of ponds and pavements, a visual motif like the spinning metal tractricoid top from “Inception.” This is a tactile picture, constructed via analogue elements that were known even before the bomb. The fast, fleet dialogue matches 1940s-movie astringent wit, as characters speak precisely of physics and labor organizing and “fascist thugs” and “and “fucking flowers” and mass genocide of the Jews, veined with grave, great strokes of comedy in the dialogue, the speech of blades. It’s all splendidly, superbly spoken and largely at top speed and of course, “What happens to stars when they die?” lies astride the lover’s question, Why? Why, Robert? Why? With Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Alden Ehrenreich, Gary Oldman, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchian and as Albert Einstein, Tom Conti. (A broad sample of the imagery is in a five-minute behind-the-scenes clip here.) “Oppenheimer” is now playing in 70mm at the Music Box, ShowPlace ICON and River East, and in 35mm and other formats. See it big and loud. Ray’s history of Chicago Ghost Signs is planned for publication next year. Previews of the project are on Twitter and on Instagram. More photography on Instagram.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan films have pushed the limits of cinematic storytelling to tell epic stories about unlikely heroes and audacious schemes that examine the necessity, morality, and hubris of ambitious endeavor. The brain-bending heist film Inception took audiences deep into the inner spaces of the dreaming mind, while his spectacular space odyssey Interstellar took them on a trippy journey into the outer limits and looping eddies of the universe. With Dunkirk, Nolan deployed multiple perspectives and time signatures to capture the harrowing experience of soldiers trying to survive the deadly and dehumanizing horrors of war, and with Tenet, he illuminated and manipulated the concepts of perspective and time to spin a metaphysical sci-fi thriller about the present under attack from the future. Though not a huge fan of most the previously mentioned films, the Oscar®-nominated writer-director now brings to the screen his most intriguing film to date, delving deep into the psyche of a brilliant scientist behind a world-shattering invention that would remake civilization threatening the future of mankind. Inspired by the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer chronicles the life and legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. With vividly gorgeous images of landscapes and horizons that serve a complete antithesis of the subject matter coupled with opening explosion montages, extreme close-up conversations and scenes flipping between color and black white, Oppenheimer is hands down Nolan’s best cinematic masterpiece that will be dissected and discussed for decades. Clocking in at three hour, there is plenty of footage that could have been expelled, but none of that takes away from the film, its direction or its star power. The story of Oppenheimer’s post-Manhattan Project years offers outside perspective on his work and legacy while also examining the motives and personalities of key individuals who impacted his life. That narrative centers on Lewis Strauss, one of many key players who had a hand in shaping America’s nuclear policy after World War II. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Strauss to serve as Secretary of Commerce. Not since Chaplin, have I seen such a riveting and complicated layering of character from Robert Downey, Jr.  His command of Strauss is beyond powerful in its focus and specificity.  Emily Blunt is another one bringing in the sheets with all the thunder as Oppenheimer’s troubled, yet loyal spouse Kitty. Matt Damon, in his stoicism, never breaks into a remnant of a decent human being with more loyalty to the government he serves than to his supposed friend. His portrayal of Leslie Groves screams the bravado required, but also serves  the audience as a means to be drawn into Oppenheimer’s story through a completely different vantage point. Cillian Murphy is the anchor for this film in the title role and a star in every sense of the word.  His steely eyed glaze and can simultaneously make the audience feel empathy and loathe his choices for the sake of science. This is never more apparent than in a interrogation scene showing Murphy naked as a symbol of transparency during his testimony.  The glee over accomplishing the creation of a weapon of mass destruction is disturbing at best, alongside witnessing how government officials use and abuse genius for their selfish political aspirations proving that power always stays in the shadows. The optics of how the sound was used to convey angst, fear, thrills and elation were brilliantly woven into the cinematic tapestry of this film making it engaging, as well as entertaining. If I had one criticism, it would be how the actual bombing of Japan was glazed over in some of the scenes like a footnote in a term paper.  The bombing of Hiroshima has left a stain on history and with America and Japan that can never be corrected. It was my hope that just a little more credence was paid in that regard. Oppenheimer may be the story of a scientist on the surface, yet at its core is more about how humanity has little regard for the future and its consequences making it the must see film of 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," A bomb explodes, the death toll is in the thousands and there’s a chance the planet might catch on fire, but in Oppenheimer (2023), director-writer Christopher Nolan’s screenplay traces destruction at a smaller, more subatomic level — the systematic ruination of a single man. For all its shots of sprawling landscapes, this is a movie that largely plays out in a series of rooms, moving from rooms in which scientists achieve greatness, to one lonely room in which a scientist falls from grace. Emulating the fission reaction that triggered the atomic bomb’s explosion, this is a screenplay that traces a cascading chain of consequences – a proposal made at a dinner party, a humiliating public remark, a critical action delayed too long – and the ripples of their aftermath. Oppenheimer is one of Christopher Nolan’s most staggering achievements – a thudding, thrilling, tremendously intimate story about a scientist who sometimes can’t see his own greatness, often can’t see past it, and tragically, can’t persuade people to believe him when he does. The director’s films have, in some way or the other, been about men attempting to exert control over vast cosmic forces so much greater than they are – time, science, space – and reckoning with the repercussions of their actions. Over his past few films, he’s broadened his focus, moving from individual obsession to widespread planetary destruction – climate change in Interstellar (2014) and Tenet (2020). Oppenheimer fuses both his thematic preoccupations, the end result an alchemy of one man’s quest for scientific advancement, and the wielding of a power he can’t control, holding the Earth to a lit match. The film plays out in three major parallel tracks. The first chronicles J. Robert Oppenheimer’s evolution from stifled student to superlative scientist and director of the Manhattan Project. The second, set in the future, has him having to answer questions about his past ties to Communists. The third, filmed in black-and-white, follows Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) during his hearing to become the US Secretary of Commerce. The film flits between an event, a retelling of the event, and the aftermath of the years into the future. We get the bomb. And the fallout. At the same time.  Questions posed in the future are answered in the past. The same sentence uttered to different people at different points in time is both, a promise and an accusation. Events are revisited and recontextualized with striking clarity. The first half plays out like a series of rapid, choppy vignettes, each scene driving home a certain point about Oppenheimer's character or his circumstances. It’s effective, if a little unmooring. But this compressing of time and information also has its casualties. To read American Prometheus, on which the film is based, is to know that Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), was never really able to bond with their son through his life. To watch the movie, particularly a scene soundtracked by a child crying as Kitty drinks in the kitchen alone, is to just see a harried mother overwhelmed by the demands of domesticity. If the first half of the film is propulsive and urgent, the second is deeply sad. Having built up to the Trinity Test, the bomb trial before it’s dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the result is oddly anti-climactic. Frantic violins give way to silence and then a shockwave like a clap of thunder. There’s a large column of fire. On the whole, however, it’s less evocative than the worlds of light and fire that Oppenheimer envisions quantum physics to be like when he shuts his eyes.  But maybe that’s the point – Nolan isn’t interested in using the full scope of his technical prowess to bring fire and fury to the screen, to have the audience gaze in wonder at the sight before them, to present it as any sort of heroic spectacle or scientific achievement at all. It’s telling that the film’s most compelling stretches are those set in small rooms, in which conversations that determine who lives and who dies play out with a casualness that only reinforces their cruelty. Having dispatched with the bomb test, the film turns its attentions to the impact it has on the physicist. The movie externalizes much of his torment. Is that clanging coming from inside Oppenheimer’s head? Is the thudding we hear the sound of his heart? A speech he gives later unfolds like a horror movie, his jubilant words at odds with his inner rumblings, his monologue interrupted by a piercing scream. However, for a filmmaker so fond of playing with perception, there are limits to what Nolan lets the audience see. The actual Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings are never depicted, and it’s the scientist’s face the camera focuses instead on as he’s faced with the aftermath. It’s a complicated endeavour – to evoke pity for Oppenheimer and his guilt over the bombings, instead of pity for the bombings themselves. Murphy, skeletal, is a haunted paradox of a man who made a choice and must now live with the consequences. The film spends just as much time in the crags and ridges of his face as it does on the plains of Los Alamos. How a scientist absorbed in splitting things down to their minutest elements could be so blind to everything else is a maddening mystery and the screenplay does a fine job of pointing out the blinkers around Oppenheimer’s piercing blue eyes. The film undercuts his self-sacrificial schtick by framing him as a man who says it’s too late to continue going down a road despite him having picked the path in the first place. Still, it induces pity for the scientist who is eventually subjected to a rigorous questioning of his loyalty to the country and his reputation is shredded down to its last atom. “The bigger the star, the more violent its demise,” a character says of the astronomical body, and the same is true of Oppenheimer. So much of Nolan’s filmography is about time lost, moments left unseized, opportunities that have slipped by, but not Oppenheimer. In presenting events and then flashing forwards, the director reveals truths that weren’t evident at the time. He reaches into the future to wring absolution and justice for his protagonist. He makes things right. Then, in one of his finest climactic sequences yet, he underlines how all it took was for one man to get it horribly, horribly wrong. ",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan has done it again. He has assembled a great ensemble cast and made a visually lavish, state-of-the-art film you should see on the biggest screen you can find (I saw it in 70mm IMAX). “Oppenheimer” tells the mostly gripping story of the brilliant, fedora-and-pipe-adorned quantum physicist (Irishman Cillian Murphy in a definitive role), aka “the father of the Atomic Bomb.” Oppenheimer is an arrogant genius and the leader of the Manhattan Project. He brings together groundbreaking scientists, including Czech-American Lilli Hornig (Olivia Thirlby) and Edward Teller (Bennie Safdie). This motley band of brainiacs manufacture and test atomic weapons before the Nazis are able to, allowing the U.S. to use the weapons to force Japan to surrender. As the film tells us, Oppenheimer was an “American Prometheus,” who bestowed the the fire of the gods upon American forces. But, to paraphrase the first Morse Code message transmitted in 1944, “what hath Oppenheimer wrought?” And what was his motivation and was he a Communist spy? Based on the 2005 book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, “Oppenheimer” reminds us that J. Robert Oppenheimer was a non-observant Jew born in New York City in 1904. The story begins in color (often shifting to black-and-white) in 1954 with Oppenheimer testifying before the US. Atomic Energy Commission, where ardent conservative Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) tries to get to the bottom of Oppenheimer’s and his troubled wife Kitty’s flirtation with the Communist party in the 1930s and ’40s. It is a “kangaroo court.” As Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Emily Blunt delivers one of her strongest performances, full of anguish and sexual and intellectual fire. Florence Pugh, who plays Oppenheimer’s longtime, deeply-troubled lover Jean Tatlock, is incandescent. In flashbacks, we see a young, mentally unstable Oppenheimer having visions of the shining, spinning molecular world like the mad scientist in the old Roger Corman film “The Man with the X-Ray Eyes.” Oppenheimer goes from Harvard to Oxford and then to mainland Europe to study and meet with the greatest physicists of his era: Denmark’s Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Germany’s Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighofer) and Italian Enrico Fermi (Danny Deferrari) and more. Science is Oppy’s religion. The 3-hour “Oppenheimer” is almost an Atom-Age “Citizen Kane.” As is often the case with Nolan, the visuals are the greatest achievement. Dutch-Swedish cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema (Nolan’s “Dunkirk”) outdoes himself. If one grows tired of Nolan’s tendency to put actors’ faces in front, turning the film into a portrait gallery, Van Hoytema’s camera consistently enchants and awes. The sight of Blunt and Murphy galloping across the screen on horseback in New Mexico recalls the work of American auteur John Ford. While the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are discussed at length, we do not see them. The film’s booming climax is the Trinity Test of July, 1945. It’s hard not to see a connection between Oppenheimer and Nolan. Both are geniuses who assemble the greatest talent of their time to produce earth-shattering creations and who are harried by such relentless, unworthy adversaries as U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman and Naval officer Lewis Strauss (an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey, Jr.) and in Nolan’s case by film critics and studio executives. Watching “Oppenheimer,” which was adapted by Nolan, I wondered why we spent so much time with Strauss, who is a small, evil and vindictive man. In pursuit of its Rumpelstiltskin-like villain, “Oppenheimer” does an injustice to its magnificent, deeply-flawed hero.",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023"," Most of the time when a movie is too ambitious and tries to do too much the result is a hot mess. In those instances, I applaud the filmmaker’s effort and then quickly forget about the whole thing. But what if they pull it off? What if a filmmaker takes a massive swing and sticks the landing? If a movie stands before you like a giant house of cards that refuses to topple over, all you can do is step back and marvel at it. Such is the case with “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s magnum opus about J. Robert Oppenheimer and his part in overseeing the development of the atomic bomb. “Oppenheimer” is really three different films rolled into one. One part is a straight-up biopic about what a brilliant, complex, egotistical, flawed, glorious weirdo Oppenheimer was. He is played by Cillian Murphy, an intense actor who reliably leaves it all on the table. Here he dials it back on the surface, seeming calm and collected throughout while internally the conflict between scientific achievement and unleashing the most devastating weapon humanity has ever known constantly threatens to bubble over. It’s as Academy-Award-worthy of a performance as it gets. The second part is a historical thriller as Oppenheimer and his gaggle of scientists convene at Los Alamos, New Mexico under the watchful eye of General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon). We see the members of the famed Manhattan Project scramble in an intense race against time to complete the bomb before the Nazis do, all under a claustrophobic shroud of secrecy. The final part is a political potboiler that takes place after the war as Oppenheimer begins to speak out against nuclear proliferation and grapples with his legacy while his government attempts to discredit and silence him. This all plays out against the backdrop of a Senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the former head of the Atomic Energy Commission who worked closely with Oppenheimer after the war. Downey is as good as he’s ever been as Strauss, filling him with pathos and bile to the point you don’t know what to expect from him. This is a reintroduction to Downey as an accomplished dramatic actor after years in the superhero playpen. Expect his name to be mentioned during the Academy Awards as well. But even with such a phenomenal and deep cast (which is another testament to Nolan’s pull as he was able to get Oscar winners to come in and read five lines of dialogue), “Oppenheimer” is Nolan’s baby. Nolan is an accomplished visual filmmaker, and while there are plenty of astonishing things to look at in this movie, one of the main reasons I would say it is important to see “Oppenheimer” in a theater is to fully appreciate Nolan’s use of sound. You can feel the concussive blasts as Nolan assaults you with the dread and awesome horror of a nuclear explosion. “Oppenheimer” is a master work from a filmmaker at the top of his craft; respective of the past as it is contemplative of the future. It is a sight to behold.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is the type of old-school, star-studded, epic historical biography Hollywood does not make anymore. It’s shot on 70mm IMAX film. A full three hours in length. Overflowing in directorial flourishes reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick and David Lean. No penny pinched — every dollar is up on the screen. All of the technical aspects — from costumes to production design, set decoration to makeup, editing to cinematography, original score to sound design — border on perfection. Make no mistake, it is nothing short of extraordinary. Yet the film, a time-bending chronicle of the birth of the atomic bomb and an examination of its complicated creator, American theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (magnificently portrayed by veteran character actor Cillian Murphy), is as frustrating as it is fantastic. This is a sprawling, sometimes self-indulgent opus that determinedly keeps its central figure in the spotlight but often reduces many of its key supporting players to ephemeral one-dimensionality. Nolan has crafted something so exhilarating that its more maddening aspects can’t help but stick out like a sore thumb, and I’ll be curious to discover if my opinion of the finished product improves or diminishes on a second watch. I am not a Manhattan Project historian. I only know what I learned about Oppenheimer, the Trinity Test, and his subsequent fall from grace from what we briefly covered in my AP American History class in high school. Even though Nolan’s dense, multilayered script is based on the Pulitzer Prize–winning American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, I can’t say I have the first clue how closely the director’s narrative hews to its source material. If anything, Oppenheimer resembles Oliver Stone’s Academy Award–winning docudrama JFK more than anything else. This is also an ambitious retelling of historical events that shifts from color to black-and-white and back again as it moves backward and forward through time, as if linear storytelling was boringly passé. The film is slickly edited by Jennifer Lame (Tenet), stunningly shot by Hoyte Van Hoytema (Nebraska), and features a titanic score courtesy of composer Ludwig Göransson (Black Panther) that instantly ranks as one of the Oscar winner’s crowning achievements. These are all attributes Nolan’s film shares with Stone’s 1991 favorite. But it shares other aspects as well. There is a layer of sensationalism that keeps much of the core emotional dynamics that rumbles throughout the piece irritatingly at arm’s length. The opening act, where Nolan introduces his central figures and starts placing his pieces on the chessboard, is messy, muddled, and strangely hurried. Many of the female characters are nonentities, and their plights rarely matter in a meaningful way. Sometimes, the cavalcade of superstar faces becomes a game of “look who that is!” instead of a shining moment for a talented performer to disappear into a role and make a lasting impression. Does all of this make Oppenheimer something of a mixed bag? Certainly, but in some ways that’s more of a plus than a minus. Nolan is taking big swings and challenging the audience to pay attention. He keeps the viewer on their toes with sizzling dialogue reminiscent of 12 Angry Men or Seven Days in May and keeps the visual and audio razzle-dazzle to a surprising minimum. He presents Oppenheimer as a complex figure who is neither hero nor villain, never passing judgment on his accomplishments, thus allowing the audience to decide for themselves whether or not the seismic change he unleashed upon the world was an unpardonable sin or nothing more than a tragic inevitability that humanity was destined to discover with or without him. What I imagine will not come as a shock to anyone is that the film’s midsection at the Los Alamos testing site in New Mexico is the film’s chief asset, in particular the actual Trinity test itself. Nolan is firing on all cylinders throughout this portion of the story. Every scene between Murphy and Matt Damon — portraying project lead General Leslie Groves — is pure poetry. The byplay between Oppenheimer and his determined team of scientists crackles with urgent pizazz, most notably any interaction he has with future hydrogen bomb enthusiast Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) or longtime friend and colleague Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz). It all builds to that Trinity test, and the whole sequence is nothing less than magnificent. Nolan channels some mystical combination of Terrence Malick, David Lynch, Kathryn Bigelow, and Michael Bay during the buildup to and aftermath of that fateful July 16, 1945, morning, so much so that it was almost as if sweat were dripping right off the screen. It’s magnetically tense, and by the time the bomb drops and the world as everyone knew it up to then changed forever, I’d moved so far up to the edge of my theater seat, it’s a wonder I didn’t fall off. I’ll be curious to see how general audiences react to the final act of Nolan’s sprawling creation. Everything is presented within a two-piece framing device. One chronicles an inquest into Oppenheimer’s past associations and communist ties as they pertain to his security clearance. The other looks at the Senate congressional hearing for potential cabinet nominee Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). They are utterly intertwined, and each section is chock-full of fascinating moments and startling revelations. This is also where Nolan is his most unrestrained. Some of his flourishes work extremely well, like the casual nudity between characters sharing a postcoital conversation or a Machiavellian maestro reveling in the intricacies of a plan that’s been years in construction and that is hopefully about to pay dividends. But other aspects don’t work as well, and having characters who were mostly invisible throughout the first two-thirds of the story suddenly show up to make the most impactful revelations considerably mitigated my emotional connection to the material. It should be noted that, as much as Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt try, the women in Oppenheimer’s life barely register. After a wonderful introduction, Pugh is subsequently underutilized to such a degree it’s infuriating. As for Blunt, who portrays Oppenheimer’s wife Katherine “Kitty” Puening, while history tells us she was a complicated woman with one heck of a backstory of her own, that’s only hinted at in the sparsest of brushstrokes here. Yet, thanks to one superb scene during the inquest where the actor magnetically spars with an aggressively pugnacious Jason Clarke, she manages to come out of this relatively unscathed. I will see Oppenheimer again. Even though Nolan’s not staring into the impenetrable galactic heavens as he did in Interstellar, showcasing mystical illusions as in The Prestige, navigating the heroic retreat of Dunkirk, or introducing Batman’s arch enemy The Joker with action-packed gravitas, this is still every bit the cinematic magnum opus any of those motion pictures were.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan plantea un escenario poco frecuente para él. El director se sumerge en una película biográfica que termina siendo la más convencional de su filmografía. A través de sus herramientas como narrador, lleva a la gran pantalla la tensión, el dramatismo y el terror del origen del arma más poderosa de la humanidad. El largometraje se divide en tres partes bien marcadas y que, además, transcurren en sitios diferentes. Por un lado, un primer tramo que narra las motivaciones de Oppenheimer y su desarrollo científico en Europa. Por otro lugar, el armado en Los Álamos de una base de operaciones para la construcción de la bomba. Y, por último, en clave de thriller judicial, la acusación que el físico tuvo que enfrentar al ser culpado de comunista. Si bien la estructura se respeta, Nolan utiliza toda su destreza para jugar con la cronología e ir intercalando momentos en cada una de las líneas temporales. Esto, que en otras de sus películas (Interestelar o Tenet), representó un reto para el espectador, no resulta laberintico y permite que la historia fluya sin necesidad de repensar la temporalidad de lo que acabamos de ver. El desafío del director de Memento (2000) consiste en recrear un momento clave para la humanidad y, como esta vez no hay estimulaciones de un universo de superhéroes (Batman: El caballero de la noche), de la ciencia ficción (El Origen) o de la acción (Dunkerque), el estadounidense explota otras de sus facetas dramáticas que desarrolló en su filmografía, pero que estuvieron a la sombra de las mencionadas estridencias. Es una biopic y, por ende, su primera película centrada en un personaje real. La construcción de Julius Robert Oppenheimer, “el padre de la bomba atómica”, con sus miedos, contradicciones y defectos, se llevan todos los focos. Plagado de matices, el guion y la magnífica interpretación de Cillian Murphy (Peaky Blinders) forman un combo majestuoso. Tal como pasó con Interestelar (Interstellar, 2014), Nolan vuelve a explicar temas científicos. Como con la trilogía de Batman, el realizador explora las complejidades de un hombre poderoso. Dunkerque (Dunkirk, 2017) era, hasta la llegada de Oppenheimer (2023), la única que recreaba una parte de la historia de la humanidad. Tres temas que, de cierta manera, resumen el contexto y la intencionalidad de la cinta: un científico repleto de contradicciones que se convierte en el hombre más poderoso de la historia junto con las secuelas y la responsabilidad que esto conlleva. La cinta podría resultar extensa debido a sus tres horas de duración, pero el aspecto visual y una última hora vertiginosa lo compensan. Desde el plano técnico, el realizador vuelve a confiar en su respetado equipo y recurre a varios intérpretes que ya lo conocen. La fotografía a cargo de Hoyte Van Hoytema, quien viene trabajando con él desde hace una década, es asombrosa. El sonido (y el silencio), perpetuado por el efecto de las explosiones, es demoledor. La música de Ludwig Goransson, quien repite colaboración tras Tenet (2020), contribuye a la tensión que se pretende transmitir, aunque, por momentos, resulta abrumadora. Un elenco estelar con viejos conocidos del director como el mencionado Murphy, Gary Oldman o Casey Affleck junto a estrellas de la talla de Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. y Matt Damon, por tan solo citar algunos nombres, pisa fuerte y eleva la calidad dramática del espectáculo. Oppenheimer está basada en el libro American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (2005), de Kai Bird y Martin Sherwin, el cual, expresado por el propio Nolan, fue un texto que le recomendó el actor Robert Pattinson durante el rodaje de Tenet. El realizador, lejos de la pretenciosidad de sus obras anteriores, se acerca acá a una narración clásica. Sin embargo, no pueden faltar los saltos temporales y el juego con el montaje, características que lo llevaron a ser uno de los autores más elogiados del cine contemporáneo. El momento de la prueba Trinity (y la explosión de la bomba atómica), escenas en color (subjetivas) y en blanco negro (objetivas) según la mente del protagonista y el conflicto moral que se plantea son elementos que se conjugan a favor de la obra menos dispersa y más convencional (¿Y la más oscarizable?) de Christopher Nolan.",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023"," In a cinematic face-off, July 21 sees the release of two big-budget productions: Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s real-life re-imagining of the beloved (and sometimes behated) Mattel toy; and Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s three-hour biopic of the father of the atomic bomb. Whether you intend to watch one, both (“Barbenheimer”) or even neither, here’s the Post’s take on them. Is it too early to declare Greta Gerwig’s new movie Barbie as the beginning of fifth-wave feminism? And the Indigo Girls’ 1989 hit Closer to Fine as its anthem? The director and co-writer has crafted a film that is at once intelligent, funny, sexy and unexpectedly emotional – and all of it built around a plastic, bodaciously proportioned fashion doll that was first marketed 64 years ago, during the long trough between the movement’s first and second waves. Gerwig has somehow managed in under two hours to accuse, indict, arrest, try, convict, judge, imprison, parole, rehabilitate and release the hapless plaything, whose tarnished reputation was never even her own fault to begin with. To paraphrase Jessica Rabbit: She’s not bad, she’s just moulded that way. Barbie (the movie) first imagines that Barbie (the character, played to wide-eyed perfection by Margot Robbie) lives in Barbie (the world), or Barbieland, a veritable gynotopia where women hold all the power, all the jobs and all the real estate. Men like Ken (Ryan Gosling) exist only insofar as they are pinned under the female gaze. They don’t even have proper jobs – Ken’s is not lifeguard or surf instructor, but merely “beach.” And slyly, this status quo (like most) is largely unexamined by those who inhabit it. Barbie lives in a dreamhouse that’s as perfect as she is, but when asked where Ken resides, her response is that she never really thought about it. Alas, things are not perfect in Barbieland. Robbie’s character starts having thoughts of death. And, worse, cellulite! And so she seeks out the advice of the local guru, played by Kate McKinnon. “We call her Weird Barbie behind her back,” someone says. “And also to her face.” In one of several odd parallels with The Matrix – the film also includes some chilling echoes of Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and a hilarious, perfectly recreated scene from 2001: A Space Odyssey – Barbie is sent into the real world to seek out the little girl who is playing with her, and whose anxious, existential thoughts are presumably bleeding into Barbie’s subconscious. This leads her to the mother-daughter duo of Gloria (America Ferrera) and Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), and also to a rude awakening, as Barbie is confronted with the realization that she’s not the icon of female empowerment she always imagined herself to be. “Sexualized capitalism” is not exactly a synonym for “pleased to meet you.” And so Barbie has to figure out how to help her human owner. But that quest is soon subsumed by the need to rescue Barbieland from the Ken-tocracy, after Gosling’s character realizes that men can own houses and cars and power suits too. He brings this knowledge back to his unenlightened brethren, who decide to roll back the clock in Barbieland to 1959 and keep it there with a little brainwashing. Watching it all go down, I found myself appalled by the ladies’ loss of autonomy, even as I cheered the downtrodden dudes’ desire for more. Yes, I was Ken-flicted. But this feels like exactly the kind of wait-a-minute uncertainty Gerwig is going for in Barbie, her hand so firmly on the authorial tiller in a way that so few directors these days manage any more. I felt like I was watching the movie with her. And I found myself asking: Does sexual equality have to be a zero-sum game? Can’t we all just get along? And did they really make a Proust Barbie, who recollected things past? (No.) And did they really make a Growing Up Skipper Barbie, whose breasts got bigger when you twisted her arm? (Yes. They did.) It all takes place in a neon-coloured, mid-century manufactured world, where even the pool and the ocean waves are hard plastic surfaces. It’s Wes Anderson meets Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets The Lego Movie meets modernism, as narrated by Helen Mirren, and featuring Will Ferrell as the Mattel CEO, in a part just small enough to not wear out its welcome. Barbie is fantastic, thought-provoking fun. But don’t take it from this feminist. (And yes, some would say I can’t really be a feminist since, like a certain doll, I lack the right parts.) Take it from Ferrera’s character, who delivers a heartfelt, heart-breaking recitation on what it means to be a woman in the world, ending on a breathless “I don’t even know.” Quantum subatomic theory is notoriously difficult to explain. So too are the inner workings of the human heart. So Christopher Nolan has set himself a tall order by trying to do both in Oppenheimer, a sprawling biopic that combines psychology and physics over its three-hour runtime. Is it worth it? Yes, though be prepared for much talk and little action, at least as far as atomic explosions go. And when the Trinity test does finally take place on that fateful day in July of 1945, be warned that there’s more than an hour of film still ahead. This isn’t so much the story of the creation of the atom bomb as that of the man behind it, a figure whose larger-than-life-ness can sometimes blind us to the fact that he was just a human being, promethean achievements notwithstanding. Cillian Murphy plays the American physicist, who at 36 was given the job of overseeing the Manhattan Project, tasked with developing the world’s first nuclear bomb before the Nazis could do likewise. His military liaison is Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), a somehow less-than-no-nonsense Brigadier General whose instructions to his subordinates in the wilds of Los Alamos are: “Build him a town. Fast.” He then adds: “Let’s go recruit some scientists.” We first meet J. Robert Oppenheimer before the war, an awkward student bouncing around Europe, and a veritable black hole pulling in whatever knowledge he can find on the new physics. And, in one of the film’s first this-really-happened moments, he did try to poison one of his teachers with a cyanide-laced apple. Though Nolan wrings a little more drama out of the incident by having physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) almost take a bite. No surprise to Nolan fans that the timeline in this biopic is shuffled as though by a Vegas blackjack dealer. In one section, the war is over and Oppenheimer is being raked over the coals by a military tribunal convinced his history of left-leaning ideas make him a threat in Cold War America. Additional scenes are set in the late 1950s, with longtime Oppenheimer foe Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) about to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Commerce, but not before the members of the confirmation hearing are done digging through his former life at the Atomic Energy Commission. Then there’s the “standard” story of the creation of the atomic bomb, featuring a who’s who of physicists racing against the clock to unlock the destructive power of the atom, while somewhere off-screen the might of America’s military-industrial complex is mining and refining uranium and plutonium as quickly as it can. And further afield, scattered reports of the Nazis’ similar attempts. (Eventually, time ran out on the “thousand-year” Third Reich, and the weapon would be used against the remaining Axis adversary, Japan.) Nolan isn’t known for his strong female characters, but it’s difficult to find fault here, as the Manhattan Project was an overwhelmingly male operation. (Besides, how would the double feature than is Barbenheimer work without a little contrast?) He does include two pivotal women in Oppenheimer’s romantic life – Florence Pugh as Jean Tatlock, with whom he had an on-again off-again relationship as unstable as francium (sorry; physics joke), and Emily Blunt as Kitty, his wife. He was her fourth husband; she divorced her third after learning she was pregnant. Their influence on him is not unsubstantial, but the power of Murphy’s performance (and of the script behind it) is in illustrating that the man, like so many of us, was a collection of contradictions. He was Jewish but non-observant, left-leaning but not Communist, driven to deliver the A-bomb but dead-set against the development of its more powerful cousin, the H-bomb. Benny Safdie plays Edward Teller, the “father of the hydrogen bomb,” delivering one of the film’s scattered moments of levity when he acknowledges that his creation will need a small fission bomb to trigger its fusion reaction, so they’ll need to build one of those first. There’s also a small but vital role for Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, described by Strauss as one of the great geniuses “of our time,” which Oppenheimer corrects: “Of his time.” He was in his 60s during the war, his necessary work in relativity decades in the past, and he had little to do directly with the development of atomic weapons. Ultimately, Oppenheimer is a riveting history lesson and a calculated study of an individual who changed the course of human history forever – though as someone in the film notes, if it wasn’t him it would have been someone else. As we mark the 78th anniversary of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki next month, and continue to live with the possibility of nuclear war in Ukraine, Kashmir, Korea and elsewhere, this primer couldn’t be more timely. In fact, since July 16, 1945, the so-called timeliness of the atomic bomb has never left us. Postmedia is committed to maintaining a lively but civil forum for discussion.

"Jul 20, 2023","Mr. Nolan’s utterly enthralling film lasts three hours. But despite being as talky as a math seminar, it crackles, hurtles and whooshes, generating more suspense and excitement than anything found in the alleged climaxes of the recent superhero pictures.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," At once a character study and a reckoning with history, Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a staggering film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” that illuminates not only the intellectual life and complicated legacy of one of America’s most consequential scientific minds but also the array of opposing, divided systems that drove his ambition and determined his actions. Brilliantly considering the contradictory properties of a man who risked destroying the world in order to save it, Oppenheimer presents a portrait of the theoretical physicist as imprisoned by the same sense of paradox that propelled his obsession with quantum mechanics (which proposed light as a constant duality, both particle and wave). A scientist and administrator fascinated by arts, poetry, and literature; a devoted family man who repeatedly cheated on his wife; a brilliant theoretical physicist who was incompetent in matters of practical application; and a conduit between atomic scientists and the military and government figures overseeing their work, who discouraged his colleagues from moral or political questioning but wrestled mightily with the implications of their creation, he was as fascinatingly complex a figure as he was an ultimately unknowable one. Responsible for researching and developing the two atomic bombs that the U.S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II, Oppenheimer later opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb; he was rewarded with public humiliation, having been made a martyr of paranoid McCarthyism. Active in left-wing politics throughout the 1930s, he betrayed Communist colleagues to the U.S. government. Oppenheimer claimed to love humanity, but his scornful treatment of those around him alienated colleagues, whose professional jealousies hastened his downfall. The smartest man in any room, he rarely bothered to learn how to read one, and this proved his undoing. Adapted from American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan’s film feels definitive in its depiction of a genius at tragic odds with existence, and of all the conceptual oscillations he contained: between brilliance and naïveté, confidence and hubris, moral obligation and patriotic duty, scientific progress and political gamesmanship, apocalyptic ruination and salvation, theory and reality. Unfolding across decades, the three-hour film follows Oppenheimer — played by Cillian Murphy, in a performance of rivetingly magnetic tension — from early years in academia through the unceremonious conclusion of his career in the nuclear establishment, along the way depicting many of the events that would come to define him in public and private life. Simultaneously, it fills in the world around Oppenheimer, the camaraderie and petty vanities of the scientific establishment, and the fear-mongering groupthink of a government in the grips of the Red Scare. Taking as its centerpiece Oppenheimer’s years as the director of the clandestine Los Alamos Laboratory, where his charismatic leadership of people and ability to quickly grasp concepts across the breadth of the weapons program’s departments proved key to the success of the Manhattan Project, the film nevertheless brings into view Oppenheimer’s friendships and romantic entanglements, first his affair with volatile leftist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, whose scenes with Murphy spark with erotic heat) and later his marriage to Kitty Harrison (Emily Blunt, whose long-simmering resentments supply a different, equally tantalizing energy), a boozy divorcée who accompanies Oppenheimer to Los Alamos and whose loyalty to her husband appears only to solidify as it is tested. Equally prominent is his adversarial relationship with Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the military general who appointed Oppenheimer head of Los Alamos despite describing him as a “dilettante, a womanizer, and a suspected Communist,” prone to unstable, theatrical, and neurotic behavior. “Brilliance makes up for a lot,” Oppenheimer replies to Groves with a smirk, though his associations with Community Party members and support of leftist causes will later come back to bite him. Rather than attempt to reconcile his main character’s dualities, Nolan ingeniously transforms them into the film’s foundation, narratively and formally dividing Oppenheimer into two perspectives — that of Oppenheimer, in luxurious color, and of Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss (a shrewd, sinuous Robert Downey Jr.), in crisp black-and-white — and moving back-and-forth between these sections, one entitled “fission,” a splitting apart of atoms, and the other “fusion,” a convergence of the same. In league with Hoyte van Hoytema, his extraordinary director of photography, who shot the film on 65-millimeter film and IMAX 65mm, Nolan affords this construct a vividly cinematic grandeur, one that complements and compounds the immersive design of his filmmaking. For a story so dense with dialogue-heavy scenes of important, self-important men conversing in rooms of power, the film’s sense of scale is at once visceral and psychically deafening. The boldly nonlinear chronology also serves to amplify the enigmatic nature of Oppenheimer’s inner workings, the slipperiness of his identity, by shifting at speed between his inner and outer worlds. Even in proposing an in-depth exploration of the scientist’s haunted psychology, Nolan has placed this subjective approach to Oppenheimer in the greater objective context of historical record, pulling verbatim from the transcripts of two hearings — one a demonstrably biased 1954 tribunal that saw Oppenheimer’s security clearance revoked at the behest of political enemies; the other a 1959 confirmation in the Senate for Strauss, who was nominated as Eisenhower’s secretary of commerce — and cross-cutting between sections to super-charge causal links and connections, colliding both men’s lives together as if inside a particle accelerator. Clocking in at three hours, Oppenheimer is Nolan’s fastest-paced film to date, hurtling through time and space, from chillily removed academic echelons to sun-scorched desert panoramas, grounding it only in Murphy’s astonishing, tour-de-force performance, the power of which is magnified by close-ups that invite us to search for truth behind his piercing yet opaque eyes, across the thin, gaunt outlines of his features. Throughout, Oppenheimer is troubled by visions of a hidden world, a subatomic reality, ripples caused by rain droplets in water and fire surging with annihilative heat, as if the insurmountable expanse of the cosmos is colliding with the granularity of matter. Compartmentalization is critical to Oppenheimer, and to Oppenheimer. As the head of Los Alamos, he resists the government’s need-to-know protocols that keep scientists working in silos, but the justifications he must make to himself in order to proceed with their project take on an increasingly inconclusive characteristic. Nolan has always been fascinated by the vital illusions men create to justify their own actions, and by their hubris in imposing an order for existence. As Oppenheimer pursues scientific breakthroughs and finds himself existentially weighted with responsibility for the world’s atomic armament, and tasked with a certain performance of brilliance to the public, these vital illusions begin to fail him, and the Faustian nature of his role within the nuclear establishment becomes clear. Part biography, part psychological thriller, part horror film, Oppenheimer is both the most structured and formally inventive film that Nolan has made, and its experimentations add to the cumulative force of his spiritual reckoning, the sense that surpassing the limits of human potential has rendered him both irrevocably guilty and beyond all judgment. In first witnessing the detonation of a nuclear weapon, as a mushroom cloud rises over the American desert with the promise of obliterative power, Oppenheimer turns not to Western philosophy but to Eastern scripture, to the Bhagavad-Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Nolan clearly believes there is some truth to such a mythic framing of Oppenheimer; the dizzying construction of his film mirrors the urgency with which Groves refers to the Manhattan Project as “the most important thing to ever happen in the history of the world,” and it offers no reprieve or solution for a condition as vexing as the soul of the man who made it possible. “Theory can only take you so far,” Oppenheimer often reflects, a refrain that later haunts him — like so many other lines of dialogue that double back in Nolan’s cleverly circular script — as an ominous portend for those on the precipice of world-altering discovery. The film takes on another relevance in its final black-and-white third, as its depiction of Oppenheimer’s victimhood at the hands of the U.S. security establishment tells the truth about what befell the country’s most prominent scientist and, in doing so, speaks to not only his tragedy but the urgent need to reify the role of the scientist as a public intellectual, to heed their reasoned words of caution as much as their statements of monumental achievement.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan's brand as our foremost maker of high-line, prestige blockbusters precedes him, and ""Oppenheimer"" is his plunge inside the mind and world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who headed up the team that created the atomic bomb. You come expecting a certain level of technical mastery, and Nolan delivers. ""Oppenheimer"" is a slick, sturdy, overwhelmingly grand film, with a storytelling approach that ebbs and flows like the swells in composer Ludwig Göransson's undulating score. But it also tends to leave the viewer cold. Warmth has never been Nolan's forte, and for all its focus, ""Oppenheimer"" feels distant, a biopic that has done all the work on its subject and his conflicted, contradictory nature but is missing the ticker at its center. Cillian Murphy turns in a searing performance as Oppenheimer, known as Oppy to his close friends and colleagues. He's a genius of the troubled variety, at one point injecting his college professor's green apple with potassium cyanide after an in-class slight. (Don't worry, he has a crisis of conscience and won't let it be eaten.) He's soon on to much bigger things than poisoned apples, and he's hand-picked to head up the team that will race against Germany to build the world's first atomic bomb. It's World War II and someone's going to get there first, and Russia might be throwing its hat in the ring as well. With the annihilation of the world on the line, there's so much emphasis on the completion of the project that the ethics behind the bomb are back-burnered so far as to not even weigh into the scientific equation. Well it's no secret that the big bombs are dropped, and Nolan follows Oppy before, during and after the mushroom clouds, tracking the political and personal fallout of his work as the father of the atomic bomb, as he came to be known. It also follows his pushback on the hydrogen bomb and the political hot water it landed him in, and the communist fears that ruled the political agendas of 1950s America as well as attempts to railroad Oppenheimer and his reputation. ""Oppenheimer"" stars so many recognizable faces that it's dizzying keeping track of them all. There's Matt Damon as a hard-headed (but humorous) lieutenant general, Robert Downey Jr. as a political lifer seeking a cabinet appointment and Kenneth Branagh as Nobel Prize winning physicist Niels Bohr. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are on board as Oppenheimer's love interests. Three recent Best Actor Oscar winners, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman and Rami Malek, show up for a combined, oh, seven minutes of screen time. Hey, is that Josh Peck? Oh man, Benny Safdie's in this? Check it out, Josh Hartnett, you guys! Yo, Dane DeHaan in the building! And that's not mentioning roughly a dozen others. (It should also be noted that Tom Conti plays Albert Einstein in the film, so occasionally Einstein is wandering in and out of scenes, which isn't, well, not distracting.) The screenplay by Nolan is disorienting by design, as it unfolds in at least three parallel timelines at different times in Oppenheimer's life, shifting from black and white to color all the while. (Editor Jennifer Lame practically conducts a symphony.) We see Oppy working with a team of physicists in a large room with formulas scrawled out on chalkboards during the Manhattan Project sessions, and also answering heated questions from a group of sweaty inquisitors in an enclosed office space. There's also scenes of Downey Jr.'s character's confirmation hearings, and none of these truly come into context until well into the movie, after an A-bomb test that acts as the explosive centerpiece of the film. (The attacks themselves, alas, are left off screen.) Some of these threads feel like they're taken from separate movies altogether, particularly Pugh's storyline, and her troubled character is reduced to a manic sex bomb in the overstuffed script. One high profile character emerges as a villain in the late stages of the story, as Nolan searches for a sense of comeuppance, and a particular name drop at a key moment feels like a cheap bit of audience bait in a story searching for grounded emotional notes. But where ""Oppenheimer"" excels is in Murphy's performance and the heavy, heavy themes of military, man (and men, for that matter) and the, er, moral implications of nuclear destruction. The most effective scene has Oppenheimer speaking at a rally after the bomb is dropped on Japan, as he looks out at a crowd wildly cheering the deaths of tens of thousands in the name of nationalism and patriotism. Up until that point he's been a loyal soldier, preaching science first, with his blinders on toward the vast global implications of his work. But a bomb can change a man, and the scene unfolds as a grim commentary on politics, propaganda and human nature, and it cuts to the core of the man better than any scene in the film. Nolan's mistrust of the government and its silencing, all-reaching power is evident. He could have arrived there with a more succinct presentation, but then big subject matter calls for a big canvas, and Nolan isn't interested in scaling down or tidying up.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Oppenheimer is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. The film begins with Robert as a student facing criticism from a professor due to his struggles with the mathematics involved in chemistry at Harvard. After studying under Max Born, he obtained his Ph.D. in physics at the University of Göttingen in Germany at the age of 22. The film has raised many questions, especially with the ending when Oppenheimer has his final conversation with Albert Einstein. As the film moved forward, Oppenheimer returned to the United States, where there was a lack of focus on quantum physics, and began teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. There, he meets his on-and-off-again lover, psychiatrist, and Communist sympathizer, Jean Tatlock, Nobel Prize laureate Ernest Lawrence, and his future wife, Kitty, with whom he has a child out of wedlock. Lieutenant General Leslie Groves approaches Oppenheimer, wanting him to head the operation to build the atomic bomb. Due to his attendance at Communist Party gatherings, he initially faced disqualification from being part of Lawrence’s group. Despite his initial apprehension, Lawrence later explains that theory can only take one so far. Robert decides to establish an entire town near his hometown in Los Alamos, New Mexico. This location is ideal, offering remoteness and a lack of any significant presence within a forty-mile radius, allowing for private discussions and focused work. At the research laboratory site of the Manhattan Project, Robert and Groves recruit the world’s best scientists to join the project aimed at creating a weapon that can save humanity by letting the world know, if you have one, so do we. Ms. Tatlock ended her own life after Robert told her he could no longer see her again. That’s because he had to practice discretion, being the head of “Project Y” in Los Alamos. Initially, he broke up with her after cheating on her with Kitty, and she became pregnant. (Kitty was also married to another man at the time). However, during the initial breakup, Robert tells her that he will always answer her call. Now, after sleeping with her while married to Kitty, he cuts off ties with her, most likely because of her ties to the communist party, which started in her days at Stanford with the Bay Area’s Communist Party community. Jean killed herself on January 5th, 1994, a day after Robert visited her for the last time. While Groves suspected anyone with former ties to the Communist Party as possible traitors, particularly suspecting Rossi Lomanitz, Klaus Fuchs gathered intelligence for the Russians while working at the Manhattan Project. Klaus, a German theoretical physicist, immigrated to England after being told he was “no longer German” when the Nazis came into power. Fuchs had previously worked under Max Born, which likely contributed to Oppenheimer’s welcoming him to the project without suspicion. However, this association cast a shadow of doubt over Robert, as many perceived him as a Communist sympathizer and potentially disloyal to America when his curiosity was purely intellectual. Fuchs’s primary contact was a man named Harry Gold, to whom he transmitted information regarding the Atomic Bomb and the possible development of the Hydrogen Bomb. Strauss was the man behind the curtain in the attempt to assassinate Oppenheimer’s character. Initially hiring Oppenheimer to teach at Berkley, he served as the Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. According to the American Heritage Foundation, Strauss wanted to study physics but could not afford the tuition, which may have caused animosity towards Oppenheimer, as seen at the film’s end. Nolan’s manipulation of the timeline presents Strauss as a sympathetic character. Still, he ultimately used Oppenheimer as a pawn, preparing a cover for any potential negative consequences from his work on the Commission for political gain. As Oppenheimer grew vocal in his opposition to the development of the “H-bomb” later in life, Strauss devised a plan to have his security clearance revoked. Rather than a jury trial, a private hearing was arranged to accuse Robert of his alleged communist connections, leaving him with little opportunity for defense. Strauss went as far as to question his leadership at the Manhattan Project, even bringing up his philandering in front of Kitty at a hearing. He was labeled a threat to democracy and subsequently barred from further government work. However, Eisenhower rejected Strauss’s nomination as Secretary of Commerce after scientist David Hill, portrayed by Rami Malek, testified in defense of Oppenheimer and condemned Strauss during the hearing. At the end of the film, Oppenheimer says, “I believe we did,” while reminiscing with Albert Einstein about if the feared “chain reaction” of the atomic bomb would destroy the world. They worried that its detonation would have such intense heat that it could end all human life on Earth, turning the atmosphere into fire with a power akin to the sun. Even though Earth remained and was not destroyed after the Trinity nuclear test and the bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Robert believes they have done just that, perhaps because they opened Pandora’s box regarding escalation. As Nolan fans know, this is a common theme from the transition of the director’s Batman Begins to The Dark Knight. This revelation brings us back to the quote he read to Jean in Sanskrit: “Now I become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” We can now draw parallels to J. Robert Oppenheimer as an “American Prometheus” (a reference to the source material the film is based on), the God of Fire, who in Greek religion is associated with fire and the creation of mere mortals. Very rarely does a studio picture surprise me anymore. Yet, after watching Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, I walked away from the movie speechless (well, practically, anyway). It’s almost impossible for me to stay wide awake and confidently witness such true greatness. It’s as if everything Nolan has done is practice for this very moment. From Interstellar’s existential crisis and windstorm visuals to the classic themes and pulsating soundscape design across The Dark Knight Trilogy. From the technical prowess of Inception and the film’s exploration of the depravity of humanity and the subtle allure of the free will of Tenet. Even the latter’s exploration of personal identity. The close-up view of free will in Tenet, the allure of power in The Prestige, and the obsession of his first film Following. Of course, the classic Nolan is across his entire filmography of causality. All of Nolan’s abilities are there and left for the audience to see. This leads me to my thoughts on Oppenheimer, which are to the point. It’s the greatest biographical film ever made. You won’t have a better cinematic experience, in total, all year or maybe in the next few. Oppenheimer stars featured Nolan player Cillian Murphy, who is phenomenal here, as the titular subject. The film starts with the young Father of the Atomic Bomb in school, struggling with mathematics in the professor’s view. Robert then starts to teach at the University of California at Berkeley (in reality, splitting his time with Caltech). Robert meets his on-and-off-again lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), 1939 Nobel Prize winner Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), who knows theory will only get you so far, and his future wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt). There, Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) approaches him, requesting Oppenheimer’s involvement in creating the atomic bomb, but only after Oppenheimer assures them he has no ties to the Communist Party. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer is epic in scope, encompassing a period of fear and paranoia that led to a collective effort of hubris. The result is equally as nerve-racking and thrilling as it can be overwhelmingly powerful. Case in point, the first two acts lead to the testing scene, and the gravitas of the moment and visuals are awe-inspiring. Nolan examines what it’s like for Oppenheimer to be considered a hero. And, of course, sticking around long enough to be the villain and hero again. Murphy delivers an astonishing turn that transcends standard biographical fare, capturing Oppenheimer’s obsession, drive, and brilliance throughout various stages of his life, with subtle timeline shifts reminiscent of Nolan’s trademarks. The actor fully embodies the man’s dedication, reportedly emulating Oppenheimer’s intense concentration by eating only a single almond daily. For one, the film’s final words spoken by Murphy are Nolan’s kiss to the world, and the collective gathering of Los Alamos residents to celebrate their victory will go down as one of the most hypnotic in film history. Oppenheimer is a perfect film. Nolan’s biographical work is worth watching for Hoyte van Hoytema’s stunning minimalist cinematography, Ludwig Göransson’s pulse-pounding sound design, and the many fine performances. Expect Oscar nominations for Murphy, Damon, a scene-stealing third act from Emily Blunt, and Robert Downey Jr., who portrays politician Lewis Strauss, as well as a plethora of nominations for their outstanding achievement in sound design.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Author’s note: This Oppenheimer review was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors on strike, the film being covered here wouldn’t exist. If you are interested in helping those workers on strike, please consider giving to the Entertainment Community Fund. Oppenheimer is stunning. Christopher Nolan‘s latest film, based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, doesn’t suffer from the problems of most biopics, which tend to encompass so much while saying too little. It’s a film full to the brim, and at the start it takes a few moments to synch into its rhythms, but once you do there will probably be few films this year that will compare to it.  All the “Barbenheimer” talk does a disservice to both films – both deserve their space and time they ask the audience to sit and contemplate them. If you’re currently booked for a double feature this weekend, I’d rethink that – Oppenheimer is a three-hour experience that can test an audience, but the work is worth it. Nolan doesn’t direct this thing so much as conduct it, like a symphony. Oppenheimer, like many of Nolan’s previous films, has fractured non-linear narratives, many characters with their own motivations, a ton of information given to us at breakneck speed, and a confidence in the audience to keep up with all of it. This is not a film for amateurs, and it’s also not a movie that will come back for you if you lose the pace. But that, thematically, works. Oppenheimer is about men who cannot see the future because they must make their marks on the present, and often the film is so breakneck paced that our attention is not allowed to think of the ramifications of what is happening – that is, until it happens, and we are forced to live in the fallout. J. Robert Oppenheimer (an excellent Cillian Murphy) is plagued by visions of a world underneath the world – subatomic particles, waves of energy, and the building blocks of the fabric of creation. A quantum physics theorist, Oppenheimer is intrigued by the ideas of Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), and especially Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). But he is a better thinker than a practical scientist, and as the saying goes, those who cannot do, teach. Soon Oppenheimer’s ideas get the attention of the United States government, as well as other interested parties, including the American Communist party. Alarmed at the treatment of the Jews in Nazi Germany, Oppenheimer wants to serve, but on his terms. Oppenheimer is a vain, egotistical man, a philanderer, and someone who eschews moral quandaries for mathematical ones. The film centers around his complicated relationships with two men and two women. The two men, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), and Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), each have their own agendas and their own uses for Oppenheimer, and the two women – his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and his mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – compete for Oppenheimer’s love and attention. But for Oppenheimer, he can only focus on the problem – to beat the Nazis in the creation of a new kind of weapon, that once used, could very well destroy the world. It’s what happens after, once the genie escapes from the bottle and can never return, that haunts Oppenheimer to the end of his days. Nolan isn’t interested in a hagiography here. He never lets Oppenheimer, or the forces that drove him to become the “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” off the hook. Oppenheimer only seems interested in politics because that’s where all the money and attention is, not for any fierce convictions, except perhaps to help his own family or to save fellow Jewish scientists who are being persecuted by Hitler. Oppenheimer is full of men who can do great things, but would rather live in the moment, and damn all the repercussions of their deeds. There are a few scenes of Oppenheimer’s family life, where his children, ignored and forgotten, cry out, a background noise in Oppenheimer’s life as he pushes forward without regard for their needs and wants. Cillian Murphy is a revelation here; with so much data coming at the audience from all directions, we need a surrogate who can parse all this information for us and give us compelling character work and relatability. Murphy never quite lets us in, but once the atomic bombs drop on Japan, we can feel the weight that he carries, and understand that this man will be rightfully haunted for the rest of his life. Whether or not the United Stares was justified in the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Nolan and the film allows us to come to our own conclusions (although I suspect I know where Nolan falls). But righteous or not, it was one man who orchestrated that event, and Murphy makes us feel that impact on Oppenheimer. The blood of thousands is on Oppenheimer’s hands, and the great tragedy is that he knows that while the atomic bomb was probably an inevitability, it was he who willed it into existence. It may have been ego, or hubris, or intellectual curiosity, but Oppenheimer made it happen, and he will be forever cursed. Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss is the best role he’s had, ever. Those students of history will know what impact Strauss had on Oppenheimer in the post-war years, but Nolan cleverly breaks apart that narrative for the audience to piece together. Downey says so much with just a gesture or a look, but he’s lightyears away from Tony Stark here. He puts his clever aphorisms and twitches to bed, and the result is a rich portrayal of a deeply complicated man, who plays his cards close and keeps his vendettas closer. Across the board, all the performances are amazing. I especially loved Damon’s Groves, who comes across as a gruff soldier cliché, but hides deep wells of knowledge and understanding underneath. Groves knows the kind of man Oppenheimer is. He also knows that in chemistry, certain compounds can generate a lot of energy, and a good chemist knows when to allow the reaction to happen and when that reaction is too volatile. This is one of the best roles of Matt Damon’s career. The centerpiece of the film is that atomic test in Los Alamos, and Nolan knows how to build the film up to a crescendo. But he also knows that the machinery to get us there is itself a thematic point of the film. Oppenheimer is multi-layered and dense, and not a casual sit. On one level, it is an examination of history and how humanity has gotten to where we are today. On another level, it’s a filmmaker trying to understand his craft, and come to grips with how that craft has impacted his life, both positively and negatively, and how his craft has impacted cinema. I suspect Nolan does not rest comfortably with any of it, and it’s in that conflict that real art can be made, even though it costs so much. I haven’t mentioned the tremendous score, the astounding cinematography, the editing, the script, and even most of the other performances. I must see Oppenheimer again, to pick it apart, to examine each facet, to try to understand it, to hold such a massive achievement in my mind. Much like Oppenheimer trying to comprehend the building blocks of the universe, I predict that I’m going to spend the rest of my life thinking about this movie to some degree. I probably throw around the word “masterpiece” too much. Sometimes the words fail me. Trying to quantify art, especially a piece of art as daunting as Oppenheimer, can be difficult. You don’t want to swerve into hyperbole; you want your words to be trusted, and you want your readers to understand how a film, or any piece of art, affected you. Sometimes, that piece of art is just too big. Oppenheimer is like that. It sounds reductive to call it Nolan’s masterpiece, but I feel like I’m correct in saying that Oppenheimer is the film that Christopher Nolan has been working towards his entire career. It is a staggering achievement in cinema, and easily the best film so far this year. Alan Cerny has been writing about film for more than 20 years for such sites as Ain’t It Cool News, CHUD, Birth Movies Death, and ComingSoon. He has been a member of the Houston Film Critics Society since 2011. STAR WARS biased. Steven Spielberg once called Alan a “very good writer,” and Alan has the signed letter to prove it, so it must be true.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Todo lo que rodea a la bomba atómica se antoja casi por definición contradictorio. Hasta su propio creador. Robert Oppenheimer fue a la vez el responsable del proyecto Manhattan y el más fervoroso pacifista en contra de la otra bomba, la de hidrógeno, y también en contra de la propia guerra nuclear. Fue el que logró que Estados Unidos se convirtiera en la mayor potencia mundial y que, con el correr del tiempo, el capitalismo acabara como único tema en la agenda global, a la vez que él mismo de forma declarada o no tanto era comunista. Cuando Stanley Kubrick, el director de Dr Strangelove -y, por tanto, responsable del más claro precedente atómico de la película de Christopher Nolan que ahora se estrena-, se vio en el brete de explicarse, lo dejó claro: ""Lo que me interesa es que se trata del único problema social del que no es posible aprender absolutamente nada de la experiencia. Si algún día ocurre, quedará muy poco en el mundo de lo que se pueda extraer ninguna consecuencia. Probablemente no quedará tampoco nadie que pueda hacerlo"". Y ahí seguimos. Y ahí está Nolan. Oppenheimer, la película, es, fiel al campo semántico del que se apropia, ella misma una paradoja. Quiere ser la más intimista de las películas (y por ello no sólo está escrita en primera persona sino que discurre enteramente y de manera obsesiva en la mente de su protagonista), pero sin renunciar a ser el más glorioso y devastador a la vez de los espectáculos. Se plantea al espectador como un minucioso estudio de cada uno de los accidentes del pasado, de nuestro pasado, pero su intención no es otra que dibujar el perfil de nuestro futuro desde cada una de nuestras crisis presentes. Rastrea, como es norma en la filmografía del director, la función y sentido del tiempo, pero lo hace convencido del poder casi omnímodo del espacio profano y sagrado de una sala de cine, donde la soledad, dice el cineasta, se vive de manera compartida. El resultado, por adelantar el pronóstico, es una obra mayor tan ambiciosa y plena como absorbente y magnética. Son tres horas que discurren por la pantalla como una reacción en cadena de apenas un segundo. Y hace boom. Para situarnos, la película hace pie en la monumental biografía de Kai Bird y Martin J. SherwinPrometeo americano (Debate) sobre el físico que, por insistir en Kubrick, ""nos enseñó a dejar de preocuparnos y a amar la bomba"". La idea no es tanto entregarse a la hagiografía o biopic plano y sin aristas como, precisamente, caminar por encima de sus grietas, sus paradojas, sus puntos demasiado oscuros. De entrada, la película se coloca en el momento tardío en el que el investigador fue perseguido por presunto comunista en la era McCarthy para posteriormente ser calumniado como espía de la Unión Soviética y, por último, obligado a dimitir de cualquier función pública. Fue humillado un segundo después de ser convertido en el gran héroe americano. Y desde ahí en un proverbial juego circular cuyo centro se encuentra en cada uno de los puntos de la superficie, el espectador es conducido por una especie de cinta de Moebius donde el final es el principio y viceversa. La película funciona como un thriller psicológico que por momentos muta en intriga judicial a ratos se deja arrastrar sin miramientos por la convenciones del melodrama y todo ello sin renunciar a tomar cuerpo ante la conciencia del espectador según los estándares más clásicos del terror, del miedo compartido. La cámara se coloca no junto sino literalmente dentro de los ojos encendidos de Cillian Murphy y, desde ahí, desde el principio atómico de un actor en estado de gracia, construye un universo entero. Estamos ante algo así como, por apurar la metáfora, una película cuántica que desde la exhibición de los comportamientos e interacciones de las partículas cinematográficas (con perdón) a nivel atómico y subatómico acierta a dibujar el tamaño exacto de la mirada en toda su extensión cósmica. Es cine para la intimidad y el espectáculo, es cine que, ya se ha dicho, a fuerza de mover las piezas inapreciables de lo mínimo alcanza lo máximo. Es cine que explota. Si se quiere, Oppenheimer se puede leer como un destilado, precipitado o punto de llegada de buena parte de las preocupaciones y logros de todo el cine anterior del director. El director que contó de forma primigenia una historia del revés en Memento (2000) insiste en descomponer la materia misma del tiempo como algoritmo para comprender tanto el universo como del propio cine. Es el tiempo el que hace que, en cada salto evolutivo (en cada encuentro con el monolito de Kubrick en 2001), seamos diferentes, seamos otra cosa. La humanidad es así la única que en su conocimiento (o extravío) de las paradojas temporales puede llegar a convertirse en extraterrestre de sí misma. Eso es en Interstellar cuando acaba por mantener ufano y clarividente aquello de que ""Ellos somos nosotros"". Cuando Cooper se comunica con su hija desde el otro lado del espejo, desde la frontera de una nueva posibilidad de vida, no hace sino reconocer y hacer efectivo el único enigma al menos tan incomprensible como el propio tiempo: el amor. Pero en la misma medida, el tiempo nos atraviesa hasta moldear la conciencia, hasta hacer de ella la materia indistinguible de los sueños y de la propia realidad. Así ha sido desde la primeriza Following (1998) a Origen (2010), pasado por la citada Interstellar (2014), Dunkerque (2017) o, de manera laberíntica, en Tenet (2020). Incluso en los delirios de Batman algo hay de todo ello. En todas ellas, cada una reformulando un género clásico del cine a su modo, el espectador es invitado a descomponer y descomponerse en una narración que acaba por convertirse en un personaje más. La trama es siempre en el cine de Nolan no tanto el modo o camino que adopta la historia como su más evidente refutación. La narración, si se quiere, acaba por ser un efecto especial más. La fotografía hipernaturalista de Hoyte van Hoytema secundada por la música omnipresente y hasta cuántica de Ludwig Göransson y todo ello ordenado (o desordenado, según se mire) con el montaje en espiral de Jennifer Lame acaban por construir una película subyugante, hipnótica, pomposa hasta la exasperación e irrenunciable. Para complicarlo todo, quizá de forma innecesaria, lo que no discurre dentro de la cabeza de Oppenheimer es rodado en blanco y negro por aquello de distinguir con una precisión blindada lo propio (sea del protagonista sea del espectador) de lo ajeno (lo objetivo, por así decirlo). Y es ahí, en esa fractura, donde la película adquiere tonos shakespearianos que hablan de la ambición de poder, de los egos desmesurados de los hombres, de la enfermedad del reconocimiento... Robert Downey Jr, como, a la vez, protector y némesis del protagonista; junto a Emily Blunt, en papel de esposa brillante y para nada devota, a Florence Pough, encarnando a la amante comprometida y torturada, o a Benny Safdie, que da vida al científico y padre de la bomba H, son algunos de los personajes que gravitan alrededor del núcleo como electrones no exactamente libres. Todo el reparto está ahí para sudar y recrear un tiempo tan elegante en sus formas como inestable en su interior. Y también ahí, en la reinvención más o menos precisa del tumultuoso pasado reciente, Oppenheimer se luce por su amor entregado al detalle y a la panorámica, a la parte y al todo. Y luego está, claro, el instante decisivo en el que todo explota. Si David Lynch nos metió dentro de la bomba en el mítico capítulo 8 de la última temporada de Twin Peaks, Nolan mete la bomba dentro de nuestras cabezas. Sin duda, la más bella -y digna de Kurt Gödel (que también aparece)- paradoja del cine reciente. ¡Boom!",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," At one juncture in Christopher Nolan’s last outing, the mind-bending, time-rewinding spy thriller “Tenet” (2020), a scientist in the future able to weaponize and manipulate the past to alter history is likened to J. Robert Oppenheimer, lead scientist at the Manhattan Project, which produced the nuclear warhead that in effect ended World War II. Foreshadowing for this next project? That future scientist killed themselves to take their secrets with them and prevent further ripples in time; Oppenheimer, as the Cold War set in, became outspoken against nuclear proliferation and subsequently – with the help of FBI dirty trickster J. Edgar Hoover – had his security clearance revoked by the Atomic Energy Commission. It didn’t help that his wife, lover and several other personal associates had ties to the American Communist Party.  Nolan began work on his “Oppenheimer” in January, shortly after the Biden administration conferred public wrongdoing on the AEC and U.S. government for its lack of process and credible evidence against Oppenheimer, who died in 1967 at the age of 62. The film plays loyally to its roots, the 2005 biography “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, and both embrace Oppenheimer (“the father of the atomic bomb”) as a committed yet complicated man, caught at many crossroads: the morality of mass destruction, the dirty politics of Cold War paranoia and messy personal relationships. As Oppenheimer, frequent Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy portrays the scientist as a reserved, buttoned-up sort with a kind, demurring affect. He’s charismatic and approachable, with piercing blues and a gaunt sheen clearly deepened for the part; Oppie’s signature wide-brim porkpie fedora goes a long way to cement the image. It’s a bravura performance that rightly sends Murphy, best known for the series “Peaky Blinders” and Danny Boyle’s  “28 Days Later” (2002), to the fore after many years of almost getting there. He feels custom minted for the part. Nolan is a filmmaker who likes to play with time – the brilliant weaving of three timelines that converge at singular moment in “Dunkirk” (2017) as well as “Tenet” and “Memento” (2000) – and works another triptych here: the race to build the atomic bomb before the Nazis at the Las Alamos complex (something of a Western mining town) in the middle of the New Mexican desert; Oppenheimer’s 1954 hearing before the AEC inside a cramped conference room; and the senate proceedings on Eisenhower’s secretary of commerce nominee Lewis Strauss, who had been Oppenheimer’s boss at the commission. The clear but kinetic interweaving that frames the Strauss hearings in black and white and the rest in color is eerily evocative of Oliver Stone’s energetically edited and sharply acted bit of nearby history, “JFK” (1991); in “Oppenheimer,” that then-junior senator from Massachusetts poetically has a small hand in one of the three timelines.  “Oppenheimer” for the most is a deeply internal film, and Nolan deepens our access to Oppenheimer’s mental and emotional state with tearaways to stars colliding in the cold dark universe, people in a celebratory audience suddenly melting in a hot white light and, at one point during his AEC security access hearing, sex with his lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, fantastic in the small part) and him confessing to the tryst to his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt, fantastic in a larger part). The soul-rattling aural immersion and meticulous imagery by Nolan regulars composer Ludwig Göransson and cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, as well as an ace team effort by the sound department, fill out the spectacular, collective achievement. The cast beyond Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who manages to make the eely Strauss human, is a long list of potential competing supporting-actor award nods, starting with Matt Damon as general (to be) Lesley Groves, who oversees the Manhattan Project and gets to deliver a fiery back-and-forth that’s almost on par with his indelible rant in “Good Will Hunting” (1997). Also notable are director Benny Safdie (“Uncut Gems,” “Good Time”) as H-bomb scientist Edward Teller; Josh “where have you been?” Hartnett solid as Oppenheimer’s department mate at Berkeley, Ernest Lawrence; Kenneth Branagh as physicist Niels Bohr; Jason Clarke, insidious as AEC special counsel Roger Robb; and Tom Conti (another “where have you been?”) avuncular and dead on as Albert Einstein. The list goes on. Less effective are Casey Affleck as military investigator Boris Pash interrogating Oppenheimer and Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman. As to Oppenheimer’s initial reluctance to signing onto the Manhattan Project due to the potential moral and historical implications, one fellow Jewish colleague says, “We don’t know if we can’t trust ourselves with it, but we know we can’t trust the Nazis.” A point well taken, with added personal appeal. Later, after the Germans have been defeated and Truman drops the two bombs, he justifies it by saying it saved American lives and allowed him “to bring our boys home.” Truman, like Strauss, comes off as a bit of a runaway ego (he calls Oppenheimer a “crybaby” when not quite out of earshot) and the film poses whether the bombings were necessary. It’s another good pique, and a complex one for me – this was when my father, a teenage member of the 101st  Airborne, had just finished his service in Europe and was on a slow boat to Japan. Heavy stuff all around. “Tenet” was Nolan’s tightly controlled 2020 release during the height of the pandemic and the first big theatrical release at a time we were still in masks, eating outside under heater lamps and spaced apart in theaters. That release signaled the revival of the filmgoing biz and a return to normal; with “Oppenheimer” we have Hollywood writers and actors on strike, which could mark a notable damper to the release schedule come holiday season and beyond. For now we have “Oppenheimer,” which is more than a movie or a just a biopic; it’s an immersed contemplation on destiny, control and power, and obligations to the future. Looking at the political shenanigans then and now, it’s easy to see where we came from and where we are. “Oppenheimer” may not quite be an American history lesson, but it is most certainly an American fable.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Why do we watch a three-hour historical epic? We do it to be swallowed up. Other types of movies can make us see how a historical figure’s personal problems and dilemmas might be the same as ours. A big blockbuster like Oppenheimer seeks to plunge us into the very atmosphere of another time so that we can taste the air, listen to the music, feel the joys and fears of that period.  Christopher Nolan certainly has the ability to make us do all those things. It’s not easy to evoke a single mood over the course of an entire 180-minute opus. It’s even harder when that mood is one of guilt-wracked despair, and darned if Nolan doesn’t almost pull it off. This movie has much that’s impressive, and yet I can’t shake off a feeling of failure while watching this. The core of the story adapted from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer is the familiar tale of how mercurial physics genius J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) takes charge of the Manhattan Project, builds a town out of nothing near his beloved vacation spot of Los Alamos, N.M. to house the country’s most brilliant scientists, and develops the atomic bomb that ends World War II.  Around this core are two interlocking framing stories: One is at a closed hearing in 1954 when the acclaimed scientist seeks to renew his security clearance. A commission that’s clearly out to get “Oppy” hears testimony about his long-ago connections with the Communist Party. The other is at a public hearing, as Navy Rear Admiral and former Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) seeks to become America’s Commerce Secretary. A U.S. Senate committee that’s supposed to rubber-stamp his confirmation instead grills him about his affiliations with Oppenheimer. From the start, Nolan gives us precious few opportunities to catch our breath. The film toggles between timelines as Oppenheimer himself and various colleagues, friends, and enemies look back on the past dozen years or so. Oppy’s academic career comes with big panoramas of the skylines of university towns: Göttingen, Leiden, Princeton, Berkeley. No sooner does he marry Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) than their marriage is falling apart and he’s cheating on her with equally unhappily married Kitty Puening (Emily Blunt). Not much lyricism and even less humor intrudes on the unhurried but relentless drive of the narrative. The film’s conventional narrative is accompanied by expressionist touches, like Oppy being stripped naked in front of the committee while admitting to his numerous extramarital affairs. These don’t work.  A ton of recognizable faces fill the screen — Matt Damon, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, David Krumholtz, Tony Goldwyn, Alex Wolff, Dane DeHaan, David Dastmalchian, Alden Ehrenreich, Matthew Modine, Casey Affleck — yet few of them are given much to play. Josh Hartnett is cast effectively against type as a physics professor and Benny Safdie pilfers his scenes as Edward Teller, the diva physicist who applies sunscreen to his face before watching the A-bomb test. Then again, Rami Malek turns up as a low-level factotum who blows up the bad guys’ plans to destroy Oppy’s reputation, and he’s exactly the wrong actor to cast as someone whom everybody else ignores. I wish Murphy’s performance were strong enough to pull all these personalities into orbit around him, but this worthy Irish character actor misses Oppenheimer’s charisma that seduces even his enemies. We’re well past the two-hour mark when Nolan finally starts telling us what he’s going on about. The two framing stories dovetail in a way that’s marvelous and more than a bit oppressive. Various characters debate whether Oppy’s guilt over causing so many deaths in Japan is sincere or performative, and Nolan shows us that it’s both. When Nolan deigns to put his mind to a thrilling set piece — namely the testing of the A-bomb, with the scientists seeing the pillar of fire several seconds before the sound of the explosion washes over them — it comes off splendidly. It’s one of the movie’s surfeit of climaxes, as is a beautiful speech when Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) tells Oppy that one day the scientific community will shower him with honors as a way of absolving themselves for betraying him, just as Oppy once did to Einstein.  This is the story of a scientist who’s destroyed for being a peace advocate at a time when America’s power structure is drunk on building more nukes than the Soviets. The problem is, it could have been told better at two-thirds or maybe even half the length. The actual building of the bomb generates considerably less drama than you’d expect, and it could have been lost. Just the two framing stories would have sufficed on their own as a political thriller whose protagonist just happens to be the father of the Bomb. There’s a better, smaller movie inside Oppenheimer. It just got swallowed up. He was lying card-carrying communist who was no peacenik. He was FOR the United States being disarmed, never the Soviet Union. He was FOR striking Japan when his colleagues wanted a demonstration to the enemy. Why? Because Stalin had a million-man army in Manchuria wanting to take Japan and turn it into another North Korea. He didn’t lose his security clearance because of military warmongers, but because Edward Teller said he was not to be trusted, as did his former boss at Berkeley. Hollywood hagiography. Looks about as flat, lifeless, and boring as his “epic” “Dunkirk.” Robert Downey Jr as Harry Truman? Good God, just on that alone… steer clear.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," 
            With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig Göransson’s pounding musical score, “Oppenheimer” seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent. There’s also an audacity simply in releasing such a serious film in the midst of summer, a time traditionally associated with lighter fare and sequels – never mind that several of them have face-planted theatrically.

"Jul 20, 2023"," In retrospect, Warner Bros.’ decision to put their slate out on HBO Max may have had another silver lining beyond simply allowing subscribers to watch Dune at home. The company wide-chaos it inspired, which is still being litigated to this very day, freed Christopher Nolan from his longtime studio home and allowed him to make a different kind of film than the one he’d spent the last 20-odd years producing for WB. It may not surprise you that Nolan’s heart was never really into the superhero game. Still, it may come as a shock that Nolan wasn’t always in the James Bond mode either: Before Scorsese announced he’d be making The Aviator, Nolan was gearing up to make a movie about Howard Hughes, only for the project to be stillborn. There’s always been an aspect of him that feels particularly suited for biographies of “great” and extraordinary men: His formerly choked mode of emotional expression on-screen and analytical mind applies well to these stories, rooted in fact and rigor and intrigue. In short, Oppenheimer may be what Chris Nolan might have looked like without Batman, and it’s hard not to wonder exactly what other masterpieces we might have missed out on after witnessing the totality of its terrifying brilliance. Those who have spent the better part of the last decade-and-a-half ranting about a lack of Event Cinema for Adults will find their needs met and more: Oppenheimer is a clear-eyed glimpse into one of the most pivotal moments in human history, from the vantage of the oft-enigmatic man who helped shepherd it into existence. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is many things, depending on whom you ask: A master physicist, a terrible mathematician, an angsty pupil, a charismatic leader, a passionate lover, a homewrecker, a patron saint of scientific endeavor, a war criminal, a patriot, a traitor. Those last two qualities give the film its framing device: Oppenheimer’s security clearance has been challenged by a former opponent of his, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), and an inquiry – more like a prosecution – is being conducted by the Federal Government. It’s the height of the McCarthy era, and every association undertaken by either he or his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), before or after his involvement in the Manhattan Project is suspect. But the real heart of the matter is this: Why did Oppenheimer come to oppose the H-Bomb, even when his subordinates at Los Alamos helped to bring it about under his supervision? To answer that, Nolan takes us on a journey through the man’s past, equally uncovering his good works and darkest sins. It’s a three-hour anxiety attack of once-good intentions – beating Hitler to the atomic bomb, after all, is a hard mission to argue with – metastasizing into a cancer that may culminate in the destruction of the human race. Talk about joy. As an unrepentant admirer of Nolan, it’s weird to see him take an even grander narrative step than he did between The Dark Knight and Inception, complimenting the further rigor in style established when he changed cinematographer-partners between Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. To say that Oppenheimer is the best script he’s ever written is underselling the competence with which he constructed and executed near-gibberish plots into multi-faceted stories, but it’s true. Nolan excels when he handicaps himself: Dunkirk stripped him of the archetypes he’d established over the course of his career but allowed him to re-engineer his essential approach to film editing, Tenet allowed him to embrace all of his most audience-repellant curiosities and required him to innovate in pure spectacle. Outside of a flashback structure, though its achronal similarities to his prior work are often undone by its competing POVs (this is his ethos behind the usage of color, with the greyscale sequences depicting Strauss’ point of view and the color being what Oppenheimer witnessed), the lack of “action” and the sort of awe-generating imagery that one believed was the key to him sustaining audience interest forces him to make a compelling feature through traditional means: character, pace, depth, dialogue. That these facets harmonize in the way they do is a credit to the whole production’s command of tone and the seriousness of their task. Hoyte van Hoytama’s cinematography – someone should post the man up in a desert and have productions come to him, given how much he owns the landscape of the American Southwest in modern cinema – provides the scope and scale that the content doesn’t, showing us the enormity of the endeavors taking place at Los Alamos. His focus on minor details in, say, a close-up of Murphy recalls Mihai Mălaimare Jr.’s work on Paul Thomas Anderson’s The Master, using every inch of that 70mm real estate to emphasize beads of sweat or slowly forming wrinkles as Murphy hears some bit of news or an accusation. The cast, which is so stacked that it recalls the kind of mass-scale disaster picture of the ‘70s (seriously, it feels like everyone currently working in Hollywood – or at least those who have left Marvel behind or never worked with them in the first place – is present here), is uniformly excellent, with even the smallest bit players receiving a reel-worthy moment. Special mention goes to Blunt, who deploys charm and venom in equal measure, Damon, who embodies the idea of Leslie Groves in the popular consciousness about as strongly as one can; and, surprisingly, Josh Hartnett, who provides a warm presence as one of Oppenheimer’s colleagues and collaborators at Berkeley and can turn on the superstar wattage not seen on screen fully since Nolan was in preproduction on Begins. Yet the movie ultimately remains Murphy’s and, to a far lesser extent, Downey’s. The war of attrition waged by Strauss – who begins the film as a semi-sympathetic point-of-view character whom one may assume is under assault by HUAC, though it’s anything but that – has shades of Forman’s Amadeus to it (come-on-and-rock-me-oppen-heimer), with petty slights, professional envy, and a lack of prescience leading to both men’s ultimate undoing. But the comparison to Mozart – whose seemingly benign talents are underwritten by a personality his peers find repellant – is a soft one for a man like Oppenheimer. Though Nolan’s portrayal of him is sympathetic, it regards everything about the man and his character with frank doubtfulness. Even in the best of times, when he’s knee-deep in work out in Los Alamos, there remains plenty to criticize him for: He’s a brilliant mind given the full faith and credit of the United States to conduct research for them and the power does get to his head. To Nolan’s credit, all of this remains subtle enough that it never derails the film’s momentum and only adds to the growing terror of the moment. But on the most meaningful issues, the film doesn’t shy away from the reality of the matter and doesn’t let its protagonists out of its iron sights. Each defense he makes in favor of continuing the project is steadily undone until it becomes radically clear to him – and to us – just how wrong everything was after VE-Day, even if one ultimately agrees with Harry Truman’s decisions on those fateful days in August 1945. Murphy sells this slow-growing reignition of conscience with appropriate weight, with his heavy features only appearing more gaunt as he realizes that one day, the consequences of his work and his beliefs may drown the world in nuclear fire. This is where the film intersects with the Promethean myth, where, after giving humankind a tool for purposes both good and ill, Oppenheimer is destroyed by it in the aftermath, with every failsafe he depended on for ethical stability giving way when confronted with man’s worst instincts. His government, which he ultimately comes to trust despite his political beliefs thanks to them becoming an active presence in his life, shuts him out of any major decision after Trinity and renders him a pariah, stripped of his clearance and power despite his services. His semi-rakish charm, while good at getting women to cheat on their husbands with him, causes him to be isolated from a community that he once led. In the end, he’s left with the blank space found in the absence of his fiery ambitions, the light from his good intentions slowly being stretched and bent, transformed into an abyssal void by its collapse, endangering everything he once took for granted.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","  Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, starring Peaky Blinders’ Cillian Murphy as the man known as the Father of the Atom Bomb, is much like the director's last film about a turning point in 20th-century history, Dunkirk (2017). Which is to say it’s an astonishment, a colossal cinematic epic that bears down on you with immense force.
  Even the film’s world-changing central event — the United States’ detonation of the first A-bomb on July 16, 1945, several hundred miles south of Los Alamos, New Mexico — is dramatized with grave, deliberate understatement.
  This isn’t the nuclear equivalent of Charlton Heston parting the Red Seas in The Ten Commandments or the White House being blown to smithereens in Independence Day. It's about the birth and life of a thought that ends in death: When all is said and done, that rising fireball and mushroom cloud represent an idea, a mathematical proposition that has found its full practical application — this, despite the fact that there exists a slim but perilous chance (near zero, the experts at Los Alamos reassure themselves) that an unstoppable chain reaction will be triggered that ignites the atmosphere.
  It’s the brain, not the A-bomb, that’s terrifying. What sort of mind, having perfected and produced a weapon, doesn't imagine or contemplate using it? Or making it even more perfect, somehow?
  If you don’t find these questions unnerving, then just leave it to Nolan, who wrote the screenplay based on the Pulitzer-winning biography American Prometheus. A formidable technician, Nolan cuts across both storylines and time frames. He jumps from scenes in black-and-white to scenes in color, and from vast landscapes to immense closeups.
  Oppenheimer could be thought of as Warren Beatty’s Reds on steroids, but it plays more like an action thriller. It’s as if Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One were actually a serious reckoning with death: Tom Cruise's parachute doesn't open. His motorcycle lands wide of the train. The train goes over the cliff, taking every last passenger with it.
  Oppenheimer famously claimed that he remembered a line from Hindu scripture after the successful New Mexico test — “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds” — but it turned out he wasn’t really cut out for the job.
  Oppenheimer’s genius hadn’t given him much insight, or foresight, into the bomb’s quickly shifting, growing strategic value. Designed to defeat Germany, it instead became the instrument of annihilation responsible for Japan’s surrender, then the United States’ ultimate check on Russia in the arms race.
  When Oppenheimer argued after the war that nuclear information should be shared, his position triggered a different kind of chain reaction. Attacked with the weaponized ideas of the Red Scare, he was accused of being a traitor who had never outgrown his youthful sympathy for the Communist cause, who possibly even knew of Soviet moles.
  If Oppenheimer was naive — he once said he had never learned a “normal, healthy way to be a bastard” — he was nonetheless treated brutally, and unjustly, by Washington.
  Well, that’s a complex man and his role in America — an America he helped transform — reduced to a few sentences. (The e-book is 736 pages.) We apologize. Narrative boilerplate can't convey how much emotion Murphy is able to suggest with just his startling, staring blue eyes and slight but alluring chilliness, or how he expresses searing inner suffering while showing almost nothing externally.
  The most significant supporting role, though, is Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss, played by a superb Robert Downey Jr. Strauss is Oppenheimer’s emotional and intellectual counterpoint — a careerist, shrewd, glad-handing and ruthless.
  In a sense, the two of them, Strauss and Oppenheimer, collapse together into a black hole, one that consumes and crushes both pure ambition and pure thought, the cynic and the idealist alike.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Nolan’s script is based on the 2005 book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman, and part of the problem is that it strives desperately to be faithful to the prodigious research embodied in that mammoth tome.  There are so many characters flitting through the narrative, some only very briefly, that while a few of the actors playing them make a powerful impression in mere minutes (Casey Affleck as military intelligence agent Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr, an uncredited Gary Oldman as President Truman, Rami Malek as physicist David Hill), most have little opportunity to register.  Nolan’s habit of jumping quickly from one narrative thread to another and back again, accentuated by Jennifer Lame’s editing, which veers wildly from languid to brusque, contributes to the fractured, disjointed effect. Of course, perhaps that’s intended as a cinematic reflection of the emphasis on the haphazardness of reality embedded in the principles of theoretical physics on which the creation of the atomic bomb was predicated.  But if so it’s a technique that in this case remains rather hypothetical.  One can’t really fault Nolan’s failure to elucidate the principles of quantum mechanics in ways that most of us ordinary folks in the audience could begin to understand; he tries on a couple of occasions to offer the gist of the idea, but the mystery will remain just that for most of us mere mortals.  In any event, structuring the film as if its plot threads were subatomic particles randomly colliding with one another doesn’t work. Nonetheless there is a clear method in Nolan’s overall approach.  The overarching narrative thread, which runs from the very beginning through the dramatic conclusion, centers on the fraught relationship between Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy, resembling Montgomery Clift) and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr., returning impressively to real acting after toiling for years in the MCU).  We see their first meeting, in 1947, when an extravagantly obsequious Strauss welcomes the celebrated Oppenheimer to the directorship of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and watches from a distance as Oppenheimer renews his acquaintance with Einstein, a fellow at the campus.  In Nolan’s clever if disheartening application of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to human terms, Strauss, in reality a most ambitious and conniving man despite his Uriah Heepish manner, misinterprets the two men’s unheard conversation as being about him; what they really said to one another is revealed only at the film’s end. Nonetheless Strauss’s reaction to that episode, and to another in which he felt Oppenheimer denigrated his expertise, leads inexorably to two events that are covered extensively later in the film: the 1954 closed hearing under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission, of which Strauss was director, that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance, and Strauss’s senatorial confirmation hearing for the position of Secretary of Commerce in 1958.  The connection between Oppenheimer and Strauss is depicted as a collision between two men that has an explosive result for both, reflecting in human terms nature of the weapon whose fabrication Oppenheimer was instrumental in shepherding. The creation of the gadget, as it came to be called, is folded into the story through a biographical sketch of Oppenheimer’s life, from his studies in Europe in the twenties through his appointment as an instructor in theoretical physics at UC Berkeley.  It’s there that he’s approached in 1942 by the army’s Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to lead the super-secret Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb.  The choice was made despite his known leftist views, and his connections with—though not membership in—the American Communist Party through individuals like Haakon Chevalier (Jefferson Hall), a party organizer; his own brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), a party member as was his wife Jackie (Emma Dumont); and Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) a volatile psychiatrist and committed Marxist with whom Oppenheimer had a torrid, tempestuous affair.  It’s a matter that will later be brought up in the 1954 AEC hearing, where shark-like prosecutor Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) and hostile witnesses, among them Kenneth Nichols (Dane DeHaan), hone in on those associations, as well as the communist past of Oppenheimer’s sharp-tongued wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), to smear his loyalty, while his defense counsel Lloyd Garrison (Macon Blair), not permitted even to see much of the evidence, can do little to respond. It all culminates, of course, in the initial testing of the device, the movie’s visual big bang, followed by the debate over whether to use it against Japan, Germany having already surrendered.  (The actual detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki are not shown, but reports about them are heard from Oppenheimer’s perspective, on radio.)  That in turn leads to the portrayal of Oppenheimer’s growing misgivings about what he was instrumental in creating and his opposition to the development of a hydrogen bomb championed by Teller, at a time when news of Soviet nuclear capability was emerging.  That made him a logical target of the national mentality which encouraged the Red Scare of the fifties, used cannily by Strauss for his own purposes, personal as much as principled. Though the structural decisions Nolan makes in relating his interconnected plot elements to one another might leave some viewers feeling adrift in detail (and rather exhausted as the film moves toward the three-hour point), “Oppenheimer” does build dramatic energy in its final reels as the Strauss senatorial vote comes down to the wire (even if a throwaway reference to a certain senator from Massachusetts comes across as gratuitously glib).  And throughout there are occasional scenes of genuine potency, along with some moments of dark humor (especially in exchanges between Oppenheimer and Groves).  And even when things get a mite tedious, one can bask in the performances.  Murphy is quietly intense, bringing an underlying complexity to the character that calls to mind Daniel Day-Lewis’ riveting turn as Lincoln, and Damon has a field day in the showier part as Groves, though one shouldn’t discount Paul Newman’s version of him in Roland Joffé’s 1989 “Fat Man and Little Boy.”  Downey is a standout as Strauss, standing toe-to-toe with Murphy in a far more flamboyant, but equally effective, mode. The women in Oppenheimer’s life are secondary figures, but Pugh brings ferocity to Tatlock (though a scene involving nudity seems as gratuitous as the reference to the Massachusetts senator) and Blunt a steeliness to Kitty that finally comes out in a brilliant moment when she outdoes prosecutor Robb in venom and another when she stares down Teller contemptuously.  Everyone else in the large cast acquit themselves ably, but viewers will have favorites—Krumholtz’s ever-loyal Rabi, Conti’s genial Einstein, Oldman’s straightforwardly dismissive Truman.  That Nolan was able to corral them all into the film is testimony to his own track record. As to the technical side of things, this reviewer must be more circumspect.  The press screening he attended was beset by difficulties that resulted in the film not being shown at its best, and given what must have been projection problems, it’s hard to assess the cinematography (Hoyte Van Hoytema) and effects (Andrew Jackson and Scott Fisher) fairly, though one must say that the shifts between color and black-and-white sometimes seem overly blatant.  On the other hand, the production design (Ruth De Jong) and costumes (Ellen Mirojnick) look impeccable in period detail, as you might expect of a Nolan project, and Ludwig Göransson’s score has impact without becoming bombastic.  But in the interests of transparency, it must be admitted that the views expressed here might have been more positive had the viewing experience been better.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023","If you're prepared to invest your attention and listen to what is being said, you might just come out of Oppenheimer thinking you've seen, not just Nolan's best film, but one of the key films of the 21st century so far.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," It starts with contradictions of one man — physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), who led the Manhattan Project to develop the first atomic weapon and later wondered if he’d done the right thing — but throws an even  wider net.  Such as: The contradictions between scientific inquiry and the fear of what we might discover. The contradictions in the rules we live by, when we bend them and when they stiffen. The three-hour film follows the creation of the atom bomb, but while that provides the plot it isn’t really what “Oppenheimer” is about. Looming over it all is the fallout (not the radioactive kind) of that literally earth-shaking moment in history. We’re talking about big moral questions and writer/director Nolan presents them in all their maddening complexity, without telling us which side we’re supposed to take. “Oppenheimer”is less an emotional experience than an overwhelmingly intellectual one.  I can think of no other film in recent years that left me thinking so long and hard about the questions it raises…and the answers it cannot give. Of course there’s the race to beat the Nazis in making an atom bomb, with Oppenheimer creating a small city from scratch in the New Mexico desert so that his scientists and engineers (and their families) can work in secure isolation for as long as it takes (more than two years, as it turned out).  Another timeline centers on a 1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing, a McCarthy-ish kangaroo court called to determine if Oppenheimer — by now a critic of America’s Cold War policies — should be stripped of his high-level security clearance. And then (in black-and-white footage) we witness the 1959 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., in a career-high performance). Strauss is the former AEC chair and Eisenhower’s nominee for Secretary of Commerce. Many of the questions aimed at him  concern his relationship over the years with Oppenheimer, whose reputation by this time is marred  by the widespread belief that he was a Communist sympathizer. Nolan’s screenplay deftly weaves together these threads, and while we may not at first understand just what is going on (why so much emphasis on Downey’s Strauss, surely a minor figure in all this?), the setup pays off with a last-act revelation that most viewers won’t see coming. At the heart of it all is Cillian Murphy’s brilliantly contained portrayal of Oppenheimer.  What’s amazing about all this is that Oppenheimer was not a demonstrative character — he wore a mask of scientific calm and reason. Yet Murphy’s eyes suggest all that’s churning in that head.  Only after the film is over does the viewer realize he’s been totally sucked in by a performance that ignores the usual big actorish moments.  Instead he is quietly intimidating. Oppenheimer is a genius who taught himself Dutch in six weeks so that he could present a lecture on molecular physics in the audience’s language. He’s not a great mathematician or lab guy, but he sees/imagines  what others cannot. Getting far more stirm und drang screentime  are the women in Oppenheimer’s life. Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock, whom he meets in a  gathering of college Commies and with whom he maintains a sexually-charged relationship even after it’s obvious she’s slipping into mental illness.  And then there’s Mrs. Oppenheimer, played by Emily Blunt.  For much of the film Blunt seems little more than window dressing, but in the third act she becomes a fireball of righteous indignation when her husband’s patriotism is questioned. Matt Damon is terrific as Gen. Leslie Groves, heading up  the project’s military component. Groves is a mix of old-school discipline and pragmatism…he was willing to waive objections over political purity to get the brains he needed. Then his job is to keep a lid on scientists whose natural inclination is to share information, not compartmentalize it. There’s not much humor in “Oppenheimer,” but Graves’ cat-herding frustration provide most of it. Oscar winners Rami Malek, Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman (the last as President Harry Truman). Josh Hartnett. Jason Clarke. Matthew Modine. Tony Goldwyn. James Remar.  Kenneth Branagh. Tom Conti (as Einstein!!!). Dane DeHaan. Kansas City’s own David Dastmachian.  Nolan masterfully keeps all these balls in the air.  His accomplishment is doubly impressive because “Oppenheimer” has so few look-at-me-ma moments.  Very few directorial flourishes. The buildup to the detonation of the first atomic bomb outside Los Alamos is a tension-packed slow burn. The emphasis isn’t on the nuts and bolts of making the bomb, but on the nervous anticipation of Oppenheimer and his crew. And in the midst of a rowdy, patriotism-drenched celebration of the end of the war, Oppenheimer looks out over his audience of cheering colleagues and imagines their faces dissolving in the heat of a nuclear blast. “Oppenheimer” is the ultimate yes/but experience.  For every argument it presents there pops up a counter argument. Was it immoral to drop the big one on civilians?  Would it have been better to sacrifice 500,000 American lives in an invasion of Japan? Those who want to be spoon fed answers will find “Oppenheimer” frustrating.  Tough. The film tells us the world doesn’t work like that. Black and white is rarely that. I would be very interested to know your take on the sounds of the film. Some music, some music like some just effects as the train, foot stamping etc.  They seemed intrusive to me. I as certain there was a message in these sounds as there always seems to be but I could not make it out. If you have any thought I would like to know them.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," There are few stories that lend themselves to aggrandising analogy as well as the creation of the atom bomb. It is Pandora’s Box, a terrible power unleashed. It is Frankenstein’s monster. This is the stuff of gods and men. But the parallel chosen by Christopher Nolan in Oppenheimer (and by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, authors of the Pulitzer-winning book on which it is based) is that of Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods, gave it to man and was tormented for eternity as punishment. This is how Nolan invites us to see J Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atom bomb. Oppenheimer was born to a Jewish family in New York in 1904. He was a brilliant and neurotic physicist appointed director of the Los Alamos lab during the Second World War, where he oversaw the development of the atom bomb. Later, when he spoke out against the hydrogen bomb and for the need to prevent a nuclear arms race, the government he served turned against him and in 1954 stripped him of his security clearance on account of his supposed communist sympathies. Of course, Oppenheimer is a film by Time Lord Christopher Nolan, and so isn’t told so simply. There are two perspectives. The first – “Fission” – is shot in colour and is Oppenheimer’s; the camera never leaves his side. The cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, working with Nolan for the fourth time, has created a film that feels intimate even at Imax scale. In this strand, we see Oppenheimer wrestle with the ethical consequences – first theoretical, then realised – of what is euphemistically called “the gadget”. His reality is interrupted by dizzying visions of a hidden universe of stars and particles. The score by Ludwig Göransson makes way for the skull-crushing “womp” of a blast wave, or a train-like hammering that turns out to be the stamping feet of his baying fans. Such descents into emotional instability could be overripe but Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer with great subtlety, his face flickering from serenity to distress and back almost imperceptibly. With his wiriness and palest blue eyes, he is a likeness so strong you have to wonder if Nolan had this role in mind when he first cast Murphy as a villainous doctor in Batman Begins in 2005. The second perspective, “Fusion”, is straighter. Shot in black and white (a first for Imax – Kodak made the film stock specially), it follows Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), a chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Oppenheimer’s antagonist. This clever conceit allows Nolan to air criticisms of Oppenheimer and his bomb without impinging on the viewer’s empathy with him. Both perspectives feature a trial: Oppenheimer’s hearing over his security clearance and Strauss’s 1959 Senate confirmation hearing for his nomination as Eisenhower’s commerce secretary, at which his hostility towards the scientist is unveiled. The visual signalling between the two points of view is an unusual kindness from Nolan, who prefers to wheel and deal with his audience. But the Time Lord does not dare patronise viewers with date stamps, and so we must follow jumps in time ourselves. The opening words of his 2006 film The Prestige apply here, just as they do to the rest of Nolan’s work: “Are you listening closely?” It is difficult, too, to keep track of the revolving cast of white, male scientists, though there are recognisable faces: Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Benny Safdie and a barely used Rami Malek. Matt Damon is competent as gruff (when are they not?) military man Leslie Groves. As is often the case with Nolan’s films, there is little here for women to do – though Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock) and Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty) do a lot with a little; the best shot in the film is shared by them. Nolan’s script does not always find the balance between foreshadowing and exposition; one senses his hokier instincts were reined in by his brother Jonathan when they wrote together. The quote from the Bhagavad Gita that Oppenheimer supposedly recited at Trinity, “And now I am become death, destroyer of worlds”, is said not once but twice, and Oppenheimer’s line “when I was a kid I thought if I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico my life would be complete” is groan-inducing. But the perennially smug Kenneth Branagh (who was gifted the clanging line “Home” in Dunkirk) is for once largely spared from sentimentality. At three hours, it is too long – as, sigh, all films are these days – but compared with the dimension-bending twists and trickery of the films that made Nolan a superstar director, Oppenheimer feels classier, more serious. Just the atom to split this time. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Nolan has based his story of the renowned physicist Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called “father of the atomic bomb”, on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 2006, but he has alchemised the printed word into a multi-dimensional filmic voyage. Nolan makes the slightly startling claim that Oppenheimer is “the most important person who ever lived”, but the way he has framed his subject amidst the turbulent history of the 20th century, with its shifting intellectual currents, catastrophic wars and cataclysmic political upheavals, may persuade you that his claim is not so far-fetched after all. For Oppenheimer, played with a kind of mercurial and watchful intensity by Cillian Murphy, it’s an emotional and imaginative journey as well as a scientific one. We see him developing from the gifted but gauche young scientist struggling to make his presence felt at Cambridge University, until he’s urged to move on and find pastures new by renowned Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh, in one of the film’s many carefully crafted cameos). Bohr was an important pioneer of quantum theory, a field in which Oppenheimer would excel, and in subsequent European placements Oppenheimer got to know many of the leading European scientists who would later work on nuclear research in the States, or, in the case of Werner Heisenberg, on the Third Reich’s atomic plans. This international crew of scientists, many of them communists who believed that America should share its atom bomb research with its then-allies the Russians, doesn’t fit entirely comfortably into America’s Manhattan Project at Los Alamos in New Mexico. The Oppenheimer who is chosen by General Leslie Groves to helm the operation to create the bomb has developed into a more enigmatic and multilayered figure, who himself has flirted with left-leaning politics without fully signing up to them. He’s opinionated and stubborn, is prone to sexual promiscuity and has a whimsical indifference to authority, but Groves understands that he’s the man who can corral his unruly band of scientific geniuses to get the fateful bomb over the line. Matt Damon’s portrayal of Groves (pictured above) is another of the film’s mini-marvels, mixing a military can-do approach with wry humour and a pragmatic ability to brush aside past indiscretions in order to get the job done. The depiction of the first test of the bomb at the Trinity site (pictured below) is a stunning movie-within-a-movie, as “the Gadget” (as it was nicknamed) is hauled into place on its 100-foot tower against an austere backdrop of desert and low, distant hills. Contrary to internet rumours, Nolan didn’t stage a real-life atomic explosion for the movie, but his team have created a fiery and ferocious facsimile “to evoke the requisite threat, awe and horrible beauty of the Trinity test,” as he puts it. It’s a scientific triumph, and the subsequent demolition of two Japanese cities duly brings an end to World War Two, but Oppenheimer’s jubilation is short-lived. Having previously supported the use of the bomb in the face of protests about its inhumanity (he suggests critics should ask American troops embroiled in the bloodbath of the Pacific war what they think about nuking the Japanese), he’s increasingly gnawed by doubt and guilt. Impressionistic imagery of blinding white light and faces with their skin peeling off evoke the agonies inside Oppenheimer’s head, while brilliant writing for strings in Ludwig Göransson’s soundtrack evokes a world tipping off its axis. Audio effects often venture into the surreal, with the deafening sound of massed marching boots stomping brutally over the drama like a military takeover. Oppenheimer gets a full-on blast of realpolitik when he visits President Harry Truman (Gary Oldman) at the White House. A doleful Oppenheimer laments that he has “blood on his hands”. Truman, the man who dropped the big one and ended the war, snaps to an aide to get the cry-baby scientist out of his sight. In the pyramid of power, boffins (be they ever so brilliant) sit well below the politicians. After the war, Oppenheimer became both a revered national icon and a figure of controversy, with the old Communist associations returning to haunt him in the era of McCarthyism and the Cold War. In scenes shot in documentary-style black and white, there’s a powerful, nuanced performance by Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, from the Atomic Energy Commission, whose embittered persecution of Oppenheimer led to him being hauled before various investigating committees and being stripped of his security clearance. There’s excellent work, too, from Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, while Florence Pugh plays his ill-fated lover Jean Tatlock. And who could have anticipated Tom Conti’s delightful little turn as Albert Einstein? It's a remarkable film that will embed itself in your imagination, and will surely repay countless viewings.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," At Oscars Central, we stand in full solidarity with both the WGA and SAG-AFTRA. This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, films would not exist. If you are able to, you can make a donation to the Entertainment Community Fund here. Nolan’s historical thriller, Oppenheimer, not only serves as an invigorating, provocative plunge into the man behind the atomic bomb but a pounding horrific origin of nuclear power that would change foreign policy and humanity for the modern age. Often when the atomic bomb is taught in American schools, the name revolving around it is most likely former President Harry Truman. Nolan follows a recent trend in filling in the blanks of American history by bringing J. Robert Oppenheimer to the screen in a thunderous thematic and cinematic style. Oppenheimer’s story greatly mirrors the tale of Prometheus, but also closely follows one we see with American female pop stars and starlets. Nolan uses the comparison between Prometheus and Oppenheimer to warn his audiences of what is to come in the next three hours. Like Prometheus, the quantum physics pioneer was tortured by thoughts of progress. It is a classic American tragedy that has been seen in multiple American icons as they are built up until they reach ultimate power only to be torn down by those who propped them up. At times we are supposed to empathize with Oppenheimer as we watch his life’s work taken away from him by a few upset bureaucrats but then we are reminded of the pain his actions caused to multiple generations making his vilification justified. Oppenheimer’s story is grounded in reality but possesses the ambitious scope of the Greek myth. From the opening shot, Cillian Murphy is towering over the audience in IMAX 70 MM commanding their attention for the next three hours by hypnotizing them through his cornflower blue eyes and soft-spoken voice. This feels like a once-in-a-lifetime role that Cillian simply pulls off through his eyes. These blue orbs guide the audience through all the science and political jargon that with the wrong casting could have easily lost the audience along the way. When “transformative” is brought up to describe an actor’s performance Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer should be the definition. He takes on Oppenheimer across decades from the 1920s to the aging 1960s fully wearing the pain this man has carried throughout his life. Murphy doesn’t make the mistake most actors do in trying to mimic the real person he is playing. He can interpret Oppenheimer through his structure that taps into the humanity of Oppenheimer that made him the force he was. He naturally fully embodies this man for all his flaws, brilliance, and instability that are eventually refashioned into destruction. It is as if he has been preparing for this role all his life. Like an atom splitting, Murphy, like Oppenheimer, opens up a new portal of the universe for humans to access. Along the way, he dives into the center of who Oppenheimer was as a person supported by trembling imagery and an otherworldly soundscape that locks you into his inner mind as he takes on one of the hardest decisions made in humanity. Stuck in his mind, you walk through different decisions and thoughts he makes throughout the movie he passes the weight over to the audience to have to live with. Oppenheimer is a walking contradiction of brilliance and vanity. He is able to present himself where it matters but also crumbles under pressure when his actions and words come back to haunt him. He is a creator and a destroyer. Nolan decides to cover all sides of Oppenheimer which will have the audience going back and forth on whether they should be rooting for this man or not. He isn’t trying to make him likable, but present someone whose ideals of brilliance lead him to the ultimate death of civilization. It is a real rise-to-fall narrative of watching someone reach their full potential only to collapse from consequences. This could easily have been a silent film with the moral paradoxes of its characters beautifully communicated through their faces and body movement to give the same effect as it was with sound. He leads his cast members through a controlled performance exposing himself to the vulnerability of the world around him. The film is truly an ensemble with Nolan managing to secure the three Best Actor winners from 2017-2019 into small roles that top their award-winning performances. Everyone fully understands the movie they are making and performs by any means necessary to make it work. Christopher Nolan subverts the expectations for a historical biopic with explosives by creating his own rules for storytelling. Stitching crucial moments in Oppenheimer’s life taken from the book “American Prometheus” from his early university days to the security hearings, Nolan sheds the biopic identity to set a non-linear timeline of a political thriller, heist, and courtroom drama. At the core of these moments are the relationships between Oppenheimer and the people he meets along the way. The order in which Nolan chooses to place these moments adds an experimental quality in getting the order correct to reach a satisfying conclusion amongst a chain reaction of interaction and choices. The time-hopping makes the true story feel fresh and different from its fellow biopics in that its selected moments end up having major impacts as Oppenheimer’s life continues. With the help of his collaborators, Nolan expands this moment of Oppenheimer’s life into one gargantuan slow-burn epic that submerges the audience into the world of the tortured physicist. He takes a risk by splitting up his story into a black-and-white timeline and color timelines to play with the perspective of his characters. The moment these two timelines converge creates an enthralling conclusion to how the political game is played. The dreamy, apocalyptic visuals of Hoyte van Hoytema contribute to the film’s thesis on showing versus telling this story. At Oppie’s beginning, his mind is littered with planetarium-like images that communicate the possibilities of science constantly flourishing in his crowded mind. There is beauty in the sparks about what humanity can be capable of. As Oppie is older, there is a slow transition to unsettling nightmares of the destruction of what is to come from a mistake only an intellect like Oppenheimer can make. Instead of three hours of loud noises, Nolan opts for quiet moments that heighten the fragility of Oppenheimer’s point of view. Looming in the background is a claustrophobic score by Ludwig Göransson that transcends the screen for the audience to feel every beat putting them right into the room. Göransson adds tension to the sound of violins that fit the high-strung nature of Oppie, taking it to a level of manufacturated disorientation. Most movies do not understand the use of sound during explosions, but Nolan conveys his brilliance in the subject through his growing build-up with a haunting pace that feels as if history has been captured in real-time. The Trinity test scene is truly a work of art on its own thanks to the editing and score that slowly pieces it together that allows the characters to settle with the weight of what they are witnessing. The silent moment is squashed with a mind-blowing sequence to follow that will be studied by film studies classes for years to come. Oppenheimer reminds audiences of why they go to the cinema as it crafts a contradictory story of the man behind the atomic bomb presented in a truly immersive theatrical experience you can never experience at home.",POSITIVE

"Jul 20, 2023"," Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s character study of the man later named the “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” operates on all cylinders, sometimes to an overwhelming extent. A who’s who of famous scientific figures with lengthy Wikipedia entries come and go quicker than you can write their names down while giving way to the mesmerizing and horrifying beauty of the creations that J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his fellow scientists will one day help bring to life. At several points, quick edits (courtesy of editor Jennifer Lame) juxtapose the wonders of space and physics with Murphy’s piercing blue eyes staring directly into the camera. These scenes suggest he’s haunted by what his work has done or will do. That awareness and private guilt are on top of Oppenheimer’s mind—and underneath the surface—in a film that’s part courtroom drama, part psychological thriller, and part academia-tinted. It’s a warning about the hubris of mankind’s ability to destroy itself, held together primarily by Murphy’s commanding presence. Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography American Prometheus (and a script written by Nolan), Oppenheimer is set across three different timelines. One takes us through the 1954 secret hearings that resulted in Oppenheimer’s security clearance being revoked because of his left-leaning politics, Communist sympathies, and his association with several former card-carrying members—which the U.S. government already knew about during World War II—a humiliating process that more or less saw Oppenheimer’s entire life being put on trial with a biased judge, jury, and executioner working against him. Another is mainly linear, taking us through decades of Oppenheimer’s life, shading in the lines and contours that Oppenheimer’s hearing testimony outlines. Some characters barely make an impression on us and Oppenheimer himself, while others more than leave their mark as time wears down a man seldom without his porkpie hat or a cigarette; sometimes, it’s a pipe instead. And the third, filmed in 65mm black-and-white IMAX film that Nolan’s production team engineered for the movie, is the grueling 1958 Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the former Atomic Energy Commission chairman who President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated for a cabinet position. What’s supposed to be a smooth and mostly painless process—only a handful of cabinet nominations had ever been rejected to that point, and the last time it happened was during Calvin Coolidge’s presidency—turns hostile as Strauss faces fierce opposition from members of the science community for his previous treatment of Oppenheimer. His past with Oppenheimer is largely told through flashbacks and conversations with a Senate aide played by Alden Ehrenreich, who serves as a sounding board and the audience surrogate. Sometimes, the same scene plays out from different perspectives, such as a conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) that Strauss witnesses from a distance, leaving him to wonder what could have transpired. Downey Jr. plays Strauss’ resentment with increasing gravitas, reminding us—perhaps for the first time since Zodiac—that he’s got the goods. Oppenheimer might not seem like a movie that shouts “IMAX treatment,” but Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema (Nope, Interstellar, Dunkirk) use that space to grand effect. The lush landscape of Los Alamos, a remote part of New Mexico Oppenheimer found solace in that would later be one of the homes of the Manhattan Project, the classrooms of Berkeley, or the many shots that haunt Oppenheimer well before we watch the Trinity test play out all look incredible on the big screen. (I saw it in IMAX 70mm, Nolan’s preferred viewing format, which is only available in 30 theaters worldwide.) Even subtler character moments, like Murphy’s wordless stares that convey a thousand conflicting emotions or the bubbling frustration that Downey Jr. wears on his face, pop. Oppenheimer is bursting to the seam with talent, a cast so stacked with A-listers and “Oh yeah, that guy!” character actors that there are three recent best actor Oscar winners with, at most, 10 minutes of screen time combined. (And they each make the most of it.) Matt Damon proves an effectively brusque foil as Leslie Groves, the military commander in charge of the Manhattan Project. But actors like Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, David Dastmalchian, and Kenneth Branagh all get moments to shine. It also means that one of the bigger flaws in several of Nolan’s films is even more apparent. Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), a woman stifled by the role society expects her to fit into and who struggled with alcoholism, gets a standout moment in the final hour. Florence Pugh dazzles as Jean Tatlock, the young psychiatrist with whom Oppenheimer had an on-again, off-again affair over several years, during the brief windows we see her. But the women of Oppenheimer are thinly drawn, almost as if they exist only to operate and burn out in the orbit of men like Oppenheimer. Although Oppenheimer boasts a three-hour runtime, it doesn’t often feel it. Ludwig Göransson’s score expertly ramps up the tension—even when we’re watching a group of white men only toss verbal daggers at one another. One of its most harrowing moments arrives in a near-total absence of sound. There’s no score frantically filling the scene, no environmental or man-made sound, and nobody is speaking. You can only hear the sound of people breathing. “You are the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves,” Branagh’s Niels Bohr tells Oppenheimer in a scene that only scratches the surface of what Oppenheimer helped unleash. The moral quandary at the center of his highest and most terrible achievement is steeped through every step of Oppenheimer: Some scientists morally objected to the bombs being built, while others argued against it being against Japan, who they felt had already been all but defeated. And even the moment of impact is never shown directly (a decision that may be controversial with some viewers). Nolan leans on other avenues to telegraph the horrors that Oppenheimer introduced. The men who only see its glory might scoff at guilt or shame over the harm it caused. But amid celebrating his greatest achievement, Nolan and Murphy show us that Oppenheimer is more than aware of just how much blood is on his hands.

"Jul 20, 2023"," It was shot with IMAX 70mm cameras, and with zero CGI, but there are plenty of moments that make you mouth ‘How did he do that?’ in awe.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Christopher Nolan llega a la cartelera entre misiones imposibles, arqueólogos aventureros y muñecas vestidas de rosa con el que seguramente sea el proyecto más ambicioso de su carrera recreando la explosión de una bomba atómica sin el uso de efectos digitales. Pero el mayor logro de 'Oppenheimer' es que la escena que todo el mundo espera ver termina siendo anecdótica dentro de la fascinante historia del padre del armamento nuclear. 'Oppenheimer' es, al mismo tiempo, un biopic al uso sobre la figura protagonista, un thriller bélico contrarreloj, un drama judicial en forma de caza de brujas contra el fantasma comunista y un controvertido estudio sobre si el fin justifica los medios y la moral existencialista humana. Y, por supuesto, también es una película de Nolan. Su mano se nota en la construcción de un guion en el que hasta el menor diálogo es tratado con la épica de mil batallas (apoyado por la música zimmeriana de Ludwig Göransson) y en el que la ambigüedad argumental y ética sirve para mantener la tensón durante las 3 horas de metraje, sustituyendo a las espectaculares piezas de acción de sus últimas películas. Sin embargo, su firma también está presente en el rol casi insignificante al que relega a los personajes femeninos de Emily Blunt y Florence Pugh, que cumplen por encima de lo que se les pide. Pero si en 'Tenet', 'Dunkerque' e 'Interstellar' teníamos a héroes que sacrificaban sus vidas por el amor y el futuro de la humanidad, con algún que otro rayo de luz optimista y esperanzador, 'Oppenheimer' es todo lo contrario. Las vidas sacrificadas por el ""bien común"" son las de inocentes, y ni siquiera está del todo claro que con su genocidio se vaya a evitar un sombrío destino para todos nosotros cada vez más cercano y evidente. Más bien todo lo contrario. El propio J. Robert Oppenheimer confesó que, cuando vio el alcance aniquilador de su obra, se le vinieron a la mente las palabras del texto sagrado hinduista Bhagavad-gītā: ""Ahora me he convertido en la muerte, el destructor de mundos"". Esta frase se repite en la película hasta dos veces, pero lo que se oye en el momento de anunciar el primer impacto atómico contra Hiroshima, en la voz de Matt Damon, es: ""Ha pegado tremendo petardazo."" El pesimismo en aumento del personaje de Cillian Murphy, que recupera las miradas ausentes al vacío de Thomas Shelby en 'Peaky Blinders', contrasta con las ruines ansias de poder de los títeres gubernamentales, desde el mismísimo presidente Truman hasta el Lewis Strauss de un Robert Downey Jr. que se apodera del tercer acto poniendo pie y medio en la alfombra roja de la gala de los Oscar del año que viene. La carga que marca para siempre la vida de Oppenheimer no es sólo perdurar como el célebre ""padre de la bomba atómica"", sino ser el único de todo su entorno (familia, compañeros, superiores) que parece tener dudas sobre sus actos. Christopher Nolan pretende con 'Oppenheimer' subir un escalón más del Olimpo de Hollywood dejando de lado los artificios efectistas de guion con un ""bombazo"" que no deje lugar a dudas, tal y como intentan sus protagonistas. La cuestión es que muchos no verán a 'Oppenheimer' como un arma de destrucción masiva que bombardee sus sentidos, sino como fuegos artificiales: vistosos pero inofensivos.

"Jul 20, 2023"," In true Christopher Nolan fashion, Oppenheimer is a lot of movie. As usual, the often brilliant and sometimes equally frustrating auteur has set out to make the ultimate of whatever genre he’s working in, whether it’s the superhero movie with The Dark Knight, the techno-thriller with Inception, or the mind-bending space travel epic with Interstellar. In this case, he’s made the final word on biopics about controversial 20th century scientists: an exhaustive and exhausting look at the rise and fall of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist widely credited as “the father of the atomic bomb.” Oppenheimer is the man who oversaw the American scientific effort, known as the Manhattan Project, to introduce nuclear weapons to humanity. The results were terrifying. But Oppenheimer is about more than just the man, a haunted, hard-to-know figure played with impressive backbone and clarity by Cillian Murphy in a career-defining performance. It’s about the confluence of events that led this man—who one gets the impression would have been much happier doing obscure theoretical research for the rest of his life—to a point in time where his abstract ideas about the structure of reality and energy changed the course of human history. The movie is also about how humanity itself deals with the questions that Oppenheimer’s terrible discoveries raise, and what we do with the kind of power that was unleashed by the man and his vast team of scientists at the Los Alamos lab in New Mexico. The answers are depressing. It takes Nolan a full three hours to get to those answers, but for a while it’s not clear whether he’ll get there successfully. Oppenheimer throws so much incident and so many characters at you, particularly in its first hour or so, that the film is almost bewilderingly obscure for a good chunk of its first act. The fact that Nolan presents all this in his trademark elliptical, non-linear manner, with some impressionistic visuals of atomic structures and fission explosions punctuating it, makes that first third a tough sit. We initially track Oppenheimer’s rise through academia and the dizzying formation of relationships with other great thinkers of his time, while also getting glimpses of a later hearing in which a much older Oppenheimer is coming under fire for his liberal beliefs and suspected ties to Soviet Communism. A third storyline (shot in black and white) introduces us to Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the one-time head of the Atomic Energy Commission, and now up for a Cabinet post in Dwight Eisenhower’s second administration. Strauss’ connection to Oppenheimer gradually becomes clearer as the film moves along. It’s frankly almost impossible to keep track of the who’s-who of historical figures here, including hydrogen bomb creator Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), Nobel Prize-winner Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), quantum theorist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), and physicist Richard Feynman (Jack Quaid), among many others. We also meet the two major women in Oppenheimer’s life: psychiatrist and Communist activist, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and Oppenheimer’s eventual wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), neither of whom do much, although Blunt gets a rousing scene in support of her man near the film’s end. It’s when word comes that the Nazis are working on their own version of the atomic bomb—and that President Franklin D. Roosevelt has approved the United States’ own fast-track development of such a weapon—that the tension and momentum in Oppenheimer ratchets upward. As Oppenheimer and his fellow physicists toil away on the theories behind the bomb and whether it could work, the scientist is placed in charge of its actual development by General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who’s impressed by the breadth of Oppenheimer’s knowledge and some heretofore unseen qualities of leadership. It’s a gamble for that will come back to haunt Groves later, given that Oppenheimer’s progressive leanings, as well as his indirect dalliance with the American Communist party, although he was never officially a member, are well-known and viewed with some suspicion in many quarters of the government. Some of his ideas—like eventually seeking to avoid building an even bigger “super” bomb derived from a hydrogen reaction—are met with incredulity. Yet Oppenheimer, Groves, and their team race forward to complete the bomb before the Germans can, even as they try to contain the flow of information outside Los Alamos (where the military has literally built a town to keep everyone on the project in one place) and grapple with the moral implications of what they are devising. Nolan’s masterful skills at cross-cutting, the building of tension, the interplay of music and sound, and the maximum use of the IMAX 70mm compositions he and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema deploy all come to the fore during this central portion of the film, creating a genuine sense of dread and urgency as the date draws closer and the pressure gets stronger to test whether the bomb will work. The urgency arises from the drive to end the war once and for all while the dread surfaces from the fact that no one really knows what will happen when that button is pushed. Nolan’s conception of the actual, successful detonation of the Trinity bomb in the New Mexico desert is almost understated in both its terrible beauty and fearsome power, and with the entire movie essentially seen through Oppenheimer’s eyes (except for the Downey hearing sequences), we only get indirect hints at the unspeakable aftermath of the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. What we do get in the final act of the movie is not just the clear indication that we as a species are simply not equipped to handle the most powerful force yet discovered in nature—it’s immediately weaponized, launching the Cold War between us and the Soviets—but the destruction of the man who speaks out most fervently against its continued use: Oppenheimer himself, so frightened by his own creation, so rattled by its nightmarish potential, that he begins seeing horrific visions even as he uses his now high public profile to speak out passionately for a global ban on nuclear weapons. It’s in this third act of the movie and the story of Oppenheimer’s downfall, brought about primarily through the deployment of some good old-fashioned McCarthyism, intersects fully with the confirmation hearings of Strauss. It’s also here that the real villains of the story are revealed and that Oppenheimer is besieged and broken by the full weight of what has been unleashed. It’s also here that Nolan goes back to the fusillade of images and people that hampered the first act, making what should have been a precisely targeted finale into a curtain call of actors that feels longer than it should. It’s telling that one of the major figures of this part of the movie, played by a well-known, Oscar-winning actor, virtually comes out of the background to deliver a pivotal plot turn after having (as far as we can tell) almost no lines for the previous 150 minutes. It’s also notable that Nolan has to cut to quick flashbacks of the many characters in the movie in an attempt to remind you who everyone is. This is where Oppenheimer falls short, making what could have been an out-and-out triumph into a film of great ambition that doesn’t quite stick the landing, although its closing sequence is quite powerful in and of itself. The film might benefit from repeat viewings, and also from reading the book, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, on which it’s based. But those should not be prerequisites for viewing the movie on its own. On every other level, however, this is as magnificent a production as one can imagine. The details of the production design are flawless, the score by Ludwig Göransson is majestic and intimate at the same time—almost feeling like a Greek chorus in the way it echoes the mood of each scene—and the imagery is spectacular. It’s amazing that Nolan can use the 70mm film format for mostly medium shots or close-ups of people talking and yet still make it seem epic. Much of his cast also deserves kudos. Pugh and Blunt bravely work with what they’ve got, wringing empathy out of underwritten female characters, while Damon is reliable as always, and others like Hartnett make the most out of characters we don’t get a lot of time to know. Others, however, like Benny Safdie as Teller, struggle with their accents and presence. Murphy presents Oppenheimer himself as a deeply complicated man: a genius who lives inside his own head much of the time (and, it’s hinted, has some problems in there), while also able to be a forceful, commanding leader; a man deeply wounded by the hurt of others, yet also remote and businesslike; and a man who loves his country yet is willing to risk his own reputation for the greater good of humanity. His naiveté, thinking that he could get people in positions of power to understand the gravity of his warnings, is what finally undoes him. If he’s a bit inaccessible, that’s the character, not the actor, and Murphy is more than capable of holding the screen even if we never fully know Oppenheimer. Last, but not least, Robert Downey Jr. should walk away with an Oscar for his work as Lewis Strauss. Made up to look older and discarding nearly all the tics that we’ve come to know from a decade of playing Tony Stark, Downey shows us why, although he was never less than great as Iron Man, he was once championed as perhaps the greatest actor of his generation. Whether the generation that grew up with Downey as the leader of the MCU will go see this difficult, dense, and challenging movie—a film that’s the polar opposite of a “summer tentpole”—is another question entirely. Oppenheimer is bold, often daring, but never fully accessible either, which is both its strength and its biggest flaw. Like the enigmatic figure at its center, it’s complicated to a fault.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Across his tremendously intimidating and terrifyingly imaginative career, Christopher Nolan – the last great hope of American blockbuster filmmaking – has burned cities to ash, carved up the subconscious like a slice of sashimi, bent time to his will and traversed the cosmos. But a quarter-century deep into turning cold studio cash into magnificent cinematic puzzles, movies that it seems only his brain can truly unlock, Nolan has waited until now to destroy existence itself. Because while his new film, Oppenheimer, may look like a familiar biopic that has simply been scaled up to Nolan-sized heights, it is deeper, richer and more devastating than anything that the director has ever made. If Hollywood is ending as we know it – and all signs on that question point to a strong “maybe” – then Oppenheimer is the ideal movie to finish us all. At its simplest (which is, really, never), Oppenheimer traces the career of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who is credited as the father of the atomic bomb, thanks to his leadership of the Manhattan Project during the thick of the Second World War. The biographical basics are all here, from the scientist’s education abroad to his friendship with Albert Einstein to his development of the Los Alamos National Laboratory to his ultimate nuclear achievement, a death-becomes-him moment that has altered the path of humanity. But just as nothing about Oppenheimer the man is neat or tidy – his politics, his passions, his poisoning of the world – nothing about Oppenheimer the film can be so basic. Even Nolan’s story structure, seemingly tiered into two halves, is meta-splintered within itself. Technically, there is the first section labelled “Fission,” a narrative shot in full-colour that follows Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) on his steady rise throughout academia and then the U.S. military machine. The second section is called “Fusion,” in which black-and-white footage – shot on IMAX, a monochromatic first for the camera company – chronicles the fractious 1958 Senate confirmation of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a close Oppenheimer ally who is set to become President Eisenhower’s secretary of commerce. The two strands are destined for a chemical reaction of a sort – a cinematic boom – but it is not clear until the film’s final leg just what explosiveness has been hiding in plain sight all along. And when the incendiary moment does eventually arrive, audiences must then reckon with the three different timelines – the final tranche covering a secret 1954 hearing over Oppenheimer’s security clearance – have been weaving in and out all the while, requiring a recalculating of the entire narrative formula. If this sounds needlessly complicated or confusing, well, it is, at least for the film’s first 10 minutes or so, during which it takes some effort to lock in with the story. But once it clicks – and it will – the film burns hard, fast and blindingly bright. Across three hours, which zip by with the speed of any roadrunner that might race outside the Los Alamos compound, Nolan’s opus progresses from character study to political thriller to heist film (to build the world’s biggest bomb, Oppenheimer must scour the globe like a polymathic Danny Ocean) to war movie to, ultimately, an existential horror show. There is more talk than action, so to speak, but the film is that rare big-budget thing, slicked to the nines, with the resources and tenacity to ask the big questions while answering them, too. The responses contained within Oppenheimer will, or should, leave audiences so crumpled on the floor that anyone entertaining, say, the possibility of a double bill of this followed by Barbie should immediately reconsider. Oppenheimer is a captivating kind of commitment that requires significant breathing room, or maybe a spacious panic room. And anyone who might walk away from the film convinced that it is a glorification or obfuscation of a man whose machinations rained death down on Japan, as some early bad-faith talking points are already intent on miscommunicating, has either slept through the film or intentionally blinded themselves to its truths. Helping Nolan achieve all this – and Oppenheimer is an achievement as much as it is an undertaking, vast and complicated and excitingly successful – are two elements: sound and fury. The former is provided by composer Ludwig Goransson (Tenet), who brings to Oppenheimer a shattering sonic blast that hums and rattles, unnerves and energizes. The fury? It arrives on twinned fronts – the crisp, arresting cinematography of regular Nolan collaborator Hoyte van Hoytema, and the army of that-guy actors who fill its huge frames. Murphy, who is notching his sixth Nolan film here but his first where he’s the lead, is the wonderfully cracked centre of it all, alternately firm and fragile, monomaniacal and mournful. But the actor is aided by so many familiar faces doing jaggedly sharp work in the margins that it becomes hard to rank them or keep track. Downey Jr. is hugely entertaining, even if parts of Strauss seem imported from Tony Stark’s cocky iron heart. But there is also Matt Damon as military man Leslie Groves, Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr, Jason Clarke as bulldog lawyer Roger Robb, actor and sometimes director Benny Safdie (Uncut Gems) as volatile hydrogen-bomb scientist Edward Teller, and big-hearted, soul-nourishing work from David Krumholtz as Nobel Prize winner Isidor Isaac Rabi. Plus, too many other talented men to count. And they are all men who receive Nolan’s attention. Playing Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, Emily Blunt simply has very little to do outside the familiar modes of “alcoholic” and “victim of adultery.” An even worse fate befalls Florence Pugh, who as one of Oppenheimer’s early lovers must engage in a truly embarrassing sex scene the likes of which sully both the Bhagavad-Gita and the very concept of copulation. Would it have been too much for Nolan to slide in a regular player like Anne Hathaway into the role of chemist Lilli Hornig (here played, barely, by Olivia Thirlby)? Apparently so. In addition to the stacked casting – come to think of it, where is good-luck charm Michael Caine? – it is darkly funny how neatly Oppenheimer fits into the Nolan canon. The split timelines are reminiscent of Dunkirk, the brilliant men talking about largely incomprehensible science a familiar sensation pulled from Interstellar, Inception and Tenet, and the cynicism of bureaucracy and its gatekeepers lifted from The Dark Knight trilogy. (Just for kicks, Nolan has Gary Oldman, who once played Gotham’s last honest cop James Gordon, pop by to play Harry S. Truman as if the U.S. president was gangland boss Oswald “Penguin” Cobblepot.) But the biggest thread tying Oppenheimer to the rest of Nolan’s work – and what makes this film the most accessible of his visions – its unshakable confidence that humanity has doomed itself. Just as Interstellar opened on a dying Earth and Tenet fashioned a James Bond movie in which the villains were climate refugees from the future, Oppenheimer pushes audiences into considering an arms race that, Nolan argues, is destined to end in mutually assured destruction. And unlike his other films that imagined all manner of solvable apocalypses, Oppenheimer does not pretend to offer hope. Once the movie nears its end, and Oppenheimer the man must wrestle with the Oppenheimer-ized world he has helped birth, Nolan nobly and artfully assumes the role of bad-news messenger, a storyteller with one hell of a coda to deliver. Now Christopher Nolan becomes death, destroyer of worlds. Generous of him to offer everyone else doom with a view.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Oppenheimer (Estados Unidos/2023). Dirección y guion: Christopher Nolan. Fotografía: Hoyte Van Hoytema. Música: Ludwig Göransson. Edición: Jennifer Lame. Elenco: Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Robert Downey, Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Jason Clarke, Kenneth Branagh. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 180 minutos. Nuestra opinión: buena. Desde los tiempos de El origen y, sobre todo, de Interestelar, Christopher Nolan nos viene hablando de su apasionamiento por las ciencias duras. Convertir en héroe moderno y víctima de las intrigas políticas a un gran protagonista de ese mundo, J. Robert Oppenheimer (1904-1967), es la nueva obsesión del realizador británico. A él le dedica su película más larga: un relato abrumador, disimulado detrás de un seductor marco visual, sobre el triunfo y la caída del “padre fundador” de la bomba atómica que sufre más de una vez el peso sofocante de sus tres largas horas. En la visión de Nolan, Oppenheimer es un “Prometeo americano”, un científico del siglo XX que también se animó a robarle el fuego a los dioses para concederlo como ofrenda al género humano. Pero el protagonista de este relato es ante todo un teórico. Y por esa condición nunca terminará de entender algunas consecuencias de su comportamiento o, en todo caso, por qué los demás no aplican a sus hallazgos el mismo impulso virtuoso que lo inspiró. Desde esta posición, Nolan hace una interpretación ingenua, casi naíf, de cómo un gran hallazgo científico puede provocar incontables daños cuando cae bajo la manipulación política. De entrada, Nolan vuelve como en Interestelar a plantear conjeturas y especulaciones sobre la vida temprana y el mundo conceptual de Oppenheimer en el tiempo de su formación como científico, con ilustraciones propias de algún documental científico. Pero en un salto abrupto la película se transforma en un gran manifiesto testimonial y político que retoma 30 años después una agenda parecida a la del JFK de Oliver Stone. Un mapa extendido de intrigas, conspiraciones, sospechas, paranoias, lealtades y delaciones en el apasionante tramo histórico que conecta los momentos finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial con el comienzo de la Guerra Fría. Esa continuidad, como en un juego de espejos, queda a la vista en los dos episodios paralelos que Nolan registra como claves en la vida de Oppenheimer: primero, la conducción del Proyecto Manhattan, el complejo y ultrasecreto armado del plan que culminó con el lanzamiento de la bomba atómica sobre Hiroshima y Nagasaki, y luego (en blanco y negro) todo el compromiso posterior en el desarrollo de una tecnología que permitiría redoblar ese poder, en ese caso con la Unión Soviética como blanco. En uno de ellos asoma un vínculo bastante virtuoso con un alto jefe militar (el siempre convincente Matt Damon) que sabe tratar a los científicos porque se formó en ese mundo. En el otro aparece el gran villano del relato, el almirante Strauss (otro gran retrato de Robert Downey Jr.), empeñado desde su ambición política y un conflicto de egos en la destrucción sistemática de la imagen de Oppenheimer. A través de ambos episodios, Nolan nos mostrará sin demasiadas sutilezas la tensión entre la clarividencia científica de Oppenheimer y sus sentimientos culposos, sobre todo alrededor de su relación afectiva con la militante comunista Jean Tatlock (una muy desaprovechada Florence Pugh). Ese episodio, como todo el resto, se incorpora al relato a través de interminables (y a menudo tediosas) sesiones discursivas que transcurren en aulas, oficinas públicas y salones parlamentarios, ocupados por nombres y apellidos de la historia real que se superponen, mezclan y confunden más de una vez, como en un interminable laberinto. El mejor Nolan aparece solo por momentos. Cuando narra casi en tiempo real el primer ensayo de la bomba atómica con intensidad, suspenso genuino, energía, economía de palabras y una potencia visual que nos recuerda algunos grandes momentos de Dunkerque. Todo lo demás es una extensa muestra de la habilidad que siempre se le reconoció al realizador para volcar en imágenes su retórica. Esta vez nos dice que el decisivo momento histórico protagonizado por Oppenheimer merece nuestra atención. Y que el gran invento de su atribulado héroe, en manos equivocadas, puede resultar devastador. Para hacerlo recurre una y otra vez a lo largo de 180 minutos a la misma explicación, enunciada de muchas maneras, con el acompañamiento de un insistente comentario musical que subraya todavía más esos dichos. Solo en un momento, cuando Gary Oldman aparece fugazmente como Harry Truman e insinúa distraídamente hasta dónde puede llegar ese tipo de amenaza frente a la cara de pasmo de Oppenheimer (la única expresión que encuentra Cillian Murphy para personificarlo), la gran pregunta que propone Nolan queda expuesta en toda su magnitud, sin la farragosa dialéctica que domina todo lo demás. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Oppenheimer is the story of a dreamer who unleashes a nightmare upon the world.
Its a rich, deep piece about a complex and seemingly inscrutable man, the
history through which he lived, and the horrific future he helped to usher in.
Writer/director Christopher Nolan has put considerable effort, effortless skill,
and what must have been a sizeable budget into creating a three-hour film that
ponders the vastness of the unknowable and the petty destructiveness of humanity
with equal attention to detail, as well as with a mounting sense of terror. In
other words, it's a notable achievement in its own right and a bit of an
unexpected outlier in Nolan's output. The filmmaker who so often creates puzzles
involving and revolving around time, memory, dreams, and/or fictional notions of
science has once again created a narrative that feels like a bit of a puzzle.
What makes this film distinct among Nolan's others, though, is that the puzzle
reflects something about the complexities of the man and the story at its core,
instead of its own complicated nature. We're
shown about four or five stages in the life of the eponymous figure, divided
into a clean three-act structure yet pieced together, not with strict
chronology, but based on mood, historical discovery, and personal revelation, as
the man who would come to so obviously define the world in the second half of
the 20th century and beyond grapples with the sheer enormity of what he has
done. Within
that narrative, Nolan's screenplay, based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's
biography American Prometheus: The Triumph
and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, further divides itself into two
distinct perspectives. The first belong to the primary subject, and the other
belongs to that of a lesser man (By comparison, who isn't, though?), whose life
and career come to be defined by his essentially passing connection to the
protagonist. Looking at this material as a straightforward biography of one man,
the film making so much of the connection of these stories seems like more than
a bit of mystery unto itself, but again, it's not a straightforward biographical
account of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called ""Father of the Atomic
Bomb."" It's
about the man's place in history, yes, but this account is also about how so
many of his contemporaries attempted and, in many ways, succeeded in writing and
re-writing that history as it was occurring and in its immediate aftermath, as
the entire context of domestic and international politics changes because of
Oppenheimer. One of the many, many questions posed by Nolan's film is who among
these really possesses the power they claim to have. Even a question such as
that, though, is eclipsed by, perhaps, the ultimate one involving these figures:
Do any of themor, for that matter, any of usactually deserve to possess
such power? This
biography begins with relative simplicity, as we meet a young Robertplayed
throughout the course of the story by Cillian Murphy, in a staggering,
internalized performance of a man who comes to be haunted by his own
existenceat Cambridge, circa the mid-1920s. Robert, the American son of
German-Jewish immigrants, has left the United States to pursue his education in
the burgeoning field of quantum mechanics, which has yet to arrive in any
meaningful way in his home country. At
Cambridge, he is lonely, homesick, and imagining a realm beyond yet within the
tangible, visible onethe empty space between atoms, the power of gravity, the
void left by a dead star. Nolan employs a series of optical tricks for these
moments, and if we can only barely grasp their meaning (a series of circles, for
example, forming what looks to be the structure of the atom), that's basically
the point. When Robert's greatest and most terrifying work comes to fruition in
the desert of New Mexico, the imagery of fire, smoke, and sparks is first
presented in close-ups, with that same air of mystery, until the scale of the
explosion is seen and felt with unmistakable reality. The man
is one whose life and studies are devoted to theory, not practice or action, and
that's a way of saying that, as someone jokes about the initial that starts
Robert's full name, our protagonist doesn't stand for anything. After spending
some time studying in Germany, Robert returns to the United States to teach
quantum physics at Princeton, while fellow colleagues work in offices and labs
next door to put such ideas to physical tests. In
politics, Robert spends time at meetings for the local Communist Party but,
while he believes in unions and fighting the rise of fascism in Europe through
communist channels there, never joins. In his personal life, he starts a
seemingly one-sided affair with Jean (Florence Pugh), before beginning another
affair with and falling into a marriage to Kitty (Emily Blunt), the wife of a
colleague when he first meets her. That such an indecisive man would become
responsible for the most decisive creation of the 20th century is a paradox that
fits perfectly into Robert's field of study. Boiled
down to its core, the rest of the story, which follows Robert through the race
to beat the Nazis in developing the first nuclear weapon at a secret military
base in Los Alamos and a closed-door hearing several years later in regards to
his security clearance, is about the consequences of the man's life and work.
They remain unforeseen by him, because he deals in the theoretical, and are only
realized when it is far too late to do anything about what he has wrought on
himself, other individuals, and the whole of humanity. At any
point and at many specific points, Robert could take a stand, but there's a lot
of ego to the man, too (At one point, he dismisses Albert Einstein, played by
Tom Conti, and his discoveries as items of the past). There are benefits,
enabled by his military handler Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), and fame to be
had in keeping one's head down, going along with the prevailing sentiment, and
not standing for anything. The second perspective, by the way, belongs to Lewis
Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), whose path crosses Robert's after the war and whose
desire for political power slowly reveals an ancillary, resentful motive that
serves as a stark juxtaposition to the awesome power created by and the
debilitating responsibility felt by Robert. After
witnessing the destructive potential of the bomb (in a spectacular scene of
re-creation that eliminates all but awed breathing on the soundtrack) and
imagining the effects of it on human bodies (in a horrifying sequence that has
the noise of a cheering crowd pierced silent by a single, anguished scream), he
finally takes a position that, in the aftershock of victory and the rise of the
Cold War, few want to hear. Oppenheimer
forces us to bear witness to it, though, in intimate and all-too-frighteningly
human terms.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," La distribuidora, la productora, el protagonismo de esa cosa presuntamente imprescindible llamada marketing, el propio Christopher Nolan, alguien que legítimamente jamás duda de su condición de artista, convierten el estreno de Oppenheimer en el gran suceso cinematográfico del año. Falta le hace al hueco Hollywood de los últimos años inventarse películas creativas y poderosas, con capacidad para atrapar a un público masivo que no tenga atrofiado el sentido del gusto. El pase de prensa se celebra en un cine de Las Rozas (Madrid) que responde a las condiciones visuales y acústicas con las que Nolan ha concebido su película. ¿París bien vale una misa? El mosqueo ante el largo desplazamiento se me va esfumando ante la potencia visual que exhibe la pantalla. Y el sonido hace que vibre alarmantemente la butaca. También sabes que vas a estar allí durante tres horas. La norma que está imponiendo Hollywood respecto a la extenuante duración de su cine me resulta casi siempre pesarosa y gratuita, pero en el caso de esta película no miro ni compulsiva ni relajadamente el reloj. También soporto la necesidad de la vejiga. No me quiero ausentar ni mínimamente de lo que me están contando. El tiempo no abruma. Porque la historia es poderosa. También oscura. Y está bien narrada. Chistopher Nolan siempre se toma muy en serio lo que pretende hacer, es un perfeccionista. A veces le sale bordado, como en las extraordinarias El caballero oscuro y Dunkerque. Otras poseen notable atractivo para mí (Insomnio, El truco final, Interstellar) y también me puede resultar tan pretencioso como incomprensible en el caso de las insufribles Origen y Tenet. Pero la huella de su personalidad es constante. Le salga mejor o peor el producto. No creo que al insustituible Scorsese le quede mucha carrera debido a su provecta edad. Y el tantas veces hipnótico David Fincher se toma con calma su carrera. Nolan está en la onda de los anteriores. Es una de las escasas alternativas que ofrece Hollywood al cansino y rutinario cine de superhéroes, inacabables sagas y otras triunfantes naderías. Nolan escribe y dirige Oppenheimer. Y le imagino controlando hasta el menor detalle en la producción. Aborda la compleja biografía de un científico genial que engendró algo tan asombroso y de efectos monstruosos llamado bomba atómica. Este hombre no solo acumulaba inmensa sabiduría sobre la física cuántica. También brillantez y capacidad para extraer lo mejor de otros científicos, intuición, habilidad y persuasión para lograr que estos trabajaran juntos, generalizado reconocimiento público a su talento, enorme proyección social de su figura. Todo en él correspondía a la imagen de un ganador absoluto. Hasta que le acorralaron con una campaña feroz, capitaneada por burócratas poderosos que hacían doble juego con la eminencia que representaba Oppenheimer, el FBI de aquel individuo todopoderoso, amoral y siniestro llamado Edgar Hoover y las atroces consecuencias para tanta gente de la caza de brujas que estableció el senador McCarthy y sus múltiples lacayos contra presuntos o reales izquierdistas. Y resulta que Oppenheimer siempre tuvo conciencia social y había apoyado con sus palabras y con su dinero a la República durante la guerra civil española, que su hermano y personas muy cercanas habían militado en el Partido Comunista de Estados Unidos. Intentaron quemar su imagen y en parte lo consiguieron, utilizando artimañas, inventando mentiras y medias verdades, manipulando a su entorno. Nolan también retrata las zonas oscuras, el sentimiento de culpabilidad y las dudas morales del hombre que hizo posible y devastadora la bomba atómica, el arma más salvaje que ha inventado la ciencia en la depredadora historia de la humanidad. Se había creado pensando en su efecto disuasorio para utilizarla en las guerras, pero Estados Unidos comprobó su letal eficacia arrasando las trágicas ciudades japonesas de Hiroshima y Nagasaki. Durante dos años el ejército y los científicos ensayaron lo que podía ocurrir en el desierto de Los Álamos. Y aunque Rusia fuera su aliada contra el nazismo, ya empezaba la competencia y el espionaje entre ambos países para poseer cuanto antes al monstruo. Estados Unidos justificó el lanzamiento de la bomba atómica afirmando que dio fin a la guerra y que con ello se salvaron muchas vidas estadounidenses. Oppenheimer y también Albert Einstein (la relación entre estos dos cerebros privilegiados está descrita de forma sabrosa) mantuvieron dudas y también certezas terribles sobre los efectos de lo que ellos crearon. Oppenheimer posee clima, personajes matizados, diálogos inteligentes, zonas de luz y de sombra, una fuerza visual que llega a deslumbrar en algunos momentos, intérpretes que hacen creíbles a sus personajes. Nolan dispone de un guion en el que ocurren cosas desasosegantes y las rueda con solvencia. Esta película respira y crea inquietud. Te contagia esas sensaciones. Yo me conformo con eso en una época en la que ir al cine pocas veces implica cierto y añorado placer. Solo obligación.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Con la llegada de cada nueva película dirigida por Christopher Nolan renace la ansiedad. Y tras verla, los parámetros se dispersan. ¿Con qué comparar, por ejemplo, a Oppenheimer? ¿Con realizaciones del director de la trilogía de Batman, de Memento o El origen? ¿Con el infantilizado Hollywood actual?  Nolan es, si se quiere, menos arrogante y presuntuoso en Oppenheimer, sobre el padre de la bomba atómica. La película no tiene la “espectacularidad” de sus otras producciones, pero tampoco es tan compleja o laberíntica como Interestelar o Tenet, su filme anterior.  ¿Cómo reconocer una película de Nolan? Es de los escasos realizadores que construye sus historias tanto desde la imagen como desde el sonido y la música. Como Steven Spielberg con John Williams, Nolan tiene al sueco Ludwig Göransson (Tenet, las dos Pantera Negra, The Mandalorian) apuntando, resaltando mancomunándose en los efectos sonoros de la música, sea con la estridencia de sus violines o acompañando el pulso de la narración. Partamos de una base. Ante todo, Nolan tituló a su película Oppenheimer, no La bomba atómica. En las tres horas -que se pasan volando- cuenta momentos de la vida del físico J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) en tres períodos que los irá yuxtaponiendo.  Uno de los temas centrales de Oppenheimer es si los científicos son responsables o no, y en su íntima conciencia, del uso que los políticos puedan hacer de sus invenciones. Cuando el presidente Harry Truman (Gary Oldman, casi irreconocible), en su despacho oval con un retrato colgado del General San Martín -se lo ve en dos tomas- reciba a Oppenheimer tras el bombardeo atómico a Hiroshima y Nagasaki, será claro. “No importa quién inventó la bomba atómica, sino quién la lanzó”. Oppenheimer era un joven de una rica familia judía propenso a la depresión, con afinidad con las ideas de izquierda y el comunismo, partido al que jamás se afilió. Sí estuvo rodeado de comunistas: su hermano Frank y su cuñada; su esposa Kitty (Emily Blunt) había estado afiliada, y ya en el Instituto donde comienza a enseñar física cuántica quiere sindicalizar a los profesores. Esa simpatía por el comunismo le traerá dolores de cabeza, a pesar de haber sido considerado un héroe estadounidense y en buena parte él mismo logrado el final de la Segunda Guerra Mundial con su invención de la bomba atómica.  Decíamos que Nolan yuxtapone tres períodos. Uno es el central, el que sigue a Oppenheimer al frente del Proyecto Manhattan, nombrado por el militar Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), y cómo va creando la bomba en Los Alamos junto a una comunidad científica que vivió en un laboratorio secreto y una ciudad construida en medio de la nada, durante casi tres años en la carrera contra los nazis. Otra es posterior a la bomba, cuando el físico ya advierte que la carrera armamentista ponía en peligro a la humanidad, se opone al arma termonuclear (la bomba de hidrógeno) y es llevado ante una comisión por cargos de espionaje. La tercera tiene a Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), el hombre que lo resiente, el que lo puso tras la Segunda Guerra a dirigir un Instituto (“Ser genio no significa ser sabio. ¿Cómo pudo ser tan ciego?”, se pregunta), en su entrevista con parte del Senado de los EE.UU., ya que desea formar parte del gabinete del presidente Eisenhower.  Lo que ha hecho Nolan, siempre a gran escala, es una suerte de estudio de personajes -cómo le cuestan los femeninos-. Por ejemplo, captura al protagonista leyendo a T.S. Eliot, escuchando a Stravinsky, maravillándose con un Picasso y aprendiendo sánscrito.  Oppenheimer es un drama, histórico y hasta épico, contado con el manierismo habitual de su realizador, que incluye imágenes notables, sean inserts de partículas de átomo o lo que fuera.  Pero volvamos sobre lo que decíamos al inicio: la película lleva el nombre del protagonista en su título, con una interpretación excepcional de Cillian Murphy, a quien, como en Peaky Blinders, costará verlo sonreír.  El elenco es mayúsculo y, como decíamos, Nolan sabe sacarle mejor provecho a los personajes masculinos que a los femeninos (Florence Pugh como la amante comunista Jean Tatlock, parece que recitara en vez de vivir sus líneas de diálogo). A los nombrados sumen a Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke (excelente como el abogado que acusa a Oppenheimer), Tony Goldwyn, Macon Blair, Benny Safdie y hasta Tom Conti como Einstein.  De ritmo implacable, que hace que no se noten las tres horas que dura, Oppenheimer es un espécimen raro del Hollywood actual, el que seguramente le llenará de candidaturas al Oscar. Drama.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Luego de Batman Begins (2005), Christopher Nolan realiza The Prestige (2006), una película erróneamente calificada como menor, tomando en cuenta que es esencial para poder enriquecer los patrones argumentales de muchas de sus películas de partir en adelante. Nolan, hasta antes de su primera parte del personaje del cómic, había realizado películas que ya ponían en evidencia su otra obsesión: la narración de estructura no convencional. A esto se sumaba una gran habilidad por apropiarse del género del thriller que invocaba además al cine negro, a propósito de su introducción a perfiles engañosos, estafadores o artificiosos. Entonces aparece su primer Batman y surgió el cuestionamiento: ¿Por qué a Nolan le interesaría el personaje de un cómic? En esa versión, el británico revisa los antecedentes del héroe a fin de justificar el nacimiento del mito gótico, no sin antes enfrentarlo a sus miedos. Es una buena película, pero formidablemente compleja si es que lo analizamos desde un criterio de los arquetipos de la psicología analítica, lectura que resultará aún más estimulante en su siguiente parte, The Dark Knight (2008), en donde se concientiza y personifica el reto del héroe y, por lo tanto, su razón de ser: el villano o el reverso de su “yo”. Los arquetipos universales estudiados por Carl Jung son la guía académica para la trilogía de Batman, pero también Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), Tenet (2020) y sobre todo Oppenheimer (2023). Pero decía, The Prestige es clave para introducirnos a la mirada del autor. Se podría decir que esta película fue la respuesta a esa interrogante señalada líneas arriba. Con Batman Begins, Nolan se zambullía a los modelos del inconsciente universal orientados por el héroe, el villano, el mentor y demás; pero muchos interpretaron o redujeron esa producción como un efecto del autor siendo absorbido por el cine comercial. Pueda que sea la película menos sofisticada entre su filmografía; muy a pesar, The Prestige debería ser considerada como una obra que robustece el significado de Batman Begins o un ensayo en el cual por primera vez expone al espectador sus conceptos a partir de preguntas como qué es un director de cine, cuál es su meta y qué es lo que lo inspira a hacer películas. Obviamente, esos planteamientos no son literales. En su lugar, asiste al oficio de la magia para entender el oficio del cineasta. Recordemos su argumento. Esta historia inicia con una voz en off. El personaje de Michael Caine expone los tres momentos de todo acto de magia. La promesa (¿el acto es real o mentira?), el giro (sucede algo extraordinario), la prestidigitación (o el acto final del truco). Por su parte, estos tres momentos podrían adaptarse a una película: el director de cine nos presenta una historia verosímil, lo común se vuelve extraordinario y, finalmente, el cierre de la historia deja al espectador con esa sensación de que lo visto fue “casi” real e impredecible. En conclusión, ambos oficios, además de entretener, identifican a un público que durante todo el acto busca ser engañado por un secreto (de mago o de director de cine) que nunca deberá ser revelado. El público siempre deberá de marcharse con preguntas en su cabeza. ¿Cómo lo hizo? ¿Cómo es que me dejé engañar por una secuencia que “parece” ser real cuando sé que es un truco o ficción? Y eso es solo el principio en The Prestige, pues su argumento es también una guía sobre los arquetipos. Dos magos, interpretados por Christian Bale y Hugh Jackman, compiten entre sí. Los dos quieren ser el mejor, pero también quieren descubrir el secreto del otro. Se boicotean, están dispuestos a ser perversos con el fin de coronarse como el mejor mago. Es decir; son antagónicos. Desde una lectura de los arquetipos, son dos personas enfrentadas. Aquí no hay héroes porque ninguno obra por el bien, sino por el interés personal. Esto no solo descubre la fascinación de Nolan hacia los personajes tipo que en esencia han trascendido de las mitologías más antiguas —el germen de los arquetipos—, sino que además complementa sus ideas sobre la naturaleza y motivación del director de cine. Nolan es un obsesionado por mejorar su acto. Es también un buscador de secretos y receloso en no poner al descubierto sus trucos o actos. ¿Recuerdan el final de Inception? ¿El personaje de Leonardo Di Caprio seguía en el profundo sueño? ¿Cómo asegurarlo? No se puede. Nolan es hábil cuando se trata de atrapar al espectador en su truco final. Es la escuela de Stanley Kubrick, quien nos dejó decenas de interrogantes en el hotel Overlook. Ley del mago: nunca reveles tu truco. Ley del director de cine: nunca debes de contarlo todo. Es lo que sucede en The Prestige. Por tanto, resulta inspirador ver de ahí en adelante sus películas guiadas por los patrones de los arquetipos. Por ejemplo, los protagonistas de Inception, Interstellar y Tenet tienen una habilidad, conocimiento o arma poderosísima en sus manos. De ellos (o de su moral) depende la destrucción o preservación de las cosas. Dicho en otras palabras, están inmersos en un dilema similar al que estuvieron Prometeo o el mismo Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). Un poco de mitología griega. Tiempo después de la génesis de las especies, Zeus privó a los humanos del fuego. Fue entonces cuando el titán Prometeo decide robar el fuego para entregárselo a los humanos, lo que equivaldría extenderles un poder o conocimiento sustancial para el desarrollo de la humanidad, pero que a su vez implicó la condena del titán. En consecuencia, Zeus ordenó a que Prometeo fuera víctima de un doloroso castigo a perpetuidad. Oppenheimer inicia con el juicio de los dioses al titán Prometeo. Esta es la historia del hombre que tuvo en sus manos al “sol” y le cedió ese conocimiento a la humanidad. Consecuencia de su acto, Robert será condenado por un tribunal. Se pone en marcha lo que será el martirio del científico que tuvo como “maldición” saber mucho y compartir esa sabiduría. La mitología representa a Prometeo como un mártir. Se sacrifica en favor del desarrollo humano. Un ave gigante devoraría una y otra vez su hígado mientras estaba encadenado a una roca. Dado que era inmortal, el titán sufriría ese dolor toda la eternidad. Es una condena similar a la que padece el personaje de ficción Wolverine. Su cuerpo se regenera, no envejece. Es su superpoder, pero también su martirio. Entonces tenemos a un hombre que tiene como superpoder el conocimiento de la física en tiempos de guerra, o sea, en tiempos de desconfianza. La paranoia ante los infiltrados o felones que entregaban información a los nazis o los soviéticos. Y es que era así. Estados Unidos no estaba en guerra solamente con los alemanes, sino también con los rusos. Habrán estado en el mismo bando, pero si alguien tenía que ganar la guerra, ese era Estados Unidos. Por tanto, cualquiera que cedería información ultrasecreta —que se supone serviría para que Estados Unidos gane la guerra—, por ejemplo, a los comunistas, era considerado un traidor a la patria y debería pasar por un juicio o martirio público. Robert, luego de la exitosa prueba Trinity, o simulacro de la bomba nuclear, será culpado de haber filtrado pruebas de los ensayos preliminares a los soviéticos. Desde una lectura de la mitología o los arquetipos, se representa la caída del héroe. El titán que alcanzó el Olimpo, quien un día fue amigo de los dioses, después de haberle entregado el conocimiento a los humanos, será castigado públicamente. Ya para el último bloque de Oppenheimer, la palabra “mártir” será frecuentemente pronunciada. Es lo que simboliza Robert, o al menos esa es la impresión. A propósito, no olvidemos que Nolan es un director no solo fascinado con la naturaleza de los arquetipos, sino también con la magia, los trucos y los personajes engañosos, lo que conecta con su inclinación por el cine negro. Oppenheimer tiene de drama judicial, drama histórico, thriller y cine negro. Y es que, hasta cierto punto de la trama, algunos personajes van descubriendo su verdadera personalidad. En medio de esa lucha judicial, aparece un personaje fascinante. Para este punto, por qué no, podríamos decir que Robert es un superhéroe. La mitología griega, los arquetipos y los superhéroes. Así va la secuencia. “Un gran poder conlleva una gran responsabilidad”. La historia de Robert es una tragedia. Entonces, no suficiente con un conflicto moral o interno —algo que padeció Spiderman, Batman e incluso Thanos— aparece un enemigo. Todo héroe debe tener su villano o antagonista, y eso lo sabe perfectamente Nolan luego de The Dark Knight. Entra en escena ese personaje engañoso, esa suerte de mago que como en The Prestige hace creer a su público lo que ellos quieren creer. ¿Y qué es eso? Tomando en cuenta el contexto de la guerra y la posguerra: el enemigo está al acecho y puede ser cualquiera. El antagonista de Oppenheimer se sirve de ese miedo implantado en el inconsciente social y al igual que el personaje del Scarecrow aprovecha ello para fabricar su puesta en escena y ascender al podio o el Olimpo. Él busca trascender, busca su inmortalidad, y para ello tendrá que destronar o boicotear al otro mago. No es tanto una lucha entre el bien y el mal, sino una lucha de intereses o egos. ¿Quién ganará la batalla? ¿Quién saldrá en la portada de Times? ¿Quién será recordado y quién no? Por eso y muchas cosas más —que no podría develar a fin de evitar los spoilers— es que Oppenheimer es una película fascinante. Christopher Nolan revive el mito de Prometeo, regresa a los héroes y antagónicos de las historietas, a los magos confrontándose, esconde algunos hechos, guarda algún detalle para sí, lo suficiente para alimentar la sospecha de unos o la fantasía de otros. No olvidemos que para el director ciertos espectadores buscan ser engañados.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," “Oppenheimer,” the story of the father of the atomic bomb, isn’t exactly a biopic of scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In his twelfth film, director Christopher Nolan includes biographical details in the telling of the tale of the man who invented the first nuclear weapons but the movie is more about consequences than creation. “Just because we’re building it doesn’t mean we get to decide how it’s used,” he says of the Atomic Bomb. Nolan divides the story into two sections. The brightly colored “Fission” portrays the prickly Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) life as a tortured genius who overcame anti-Semitism to rise through the ranks of the European and American scientific elite to be recruited by the gruff Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as the director of the Manhattan Project. Charged with beating the Nazis and the Russians in a race to build a weapon of mass destruction, he became, by his own words, “the destroyer of worlds.” His close ties to the Communist Party, through his ex-girlfriend, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), is just one element of the left-leaning beliefs that eventually got his security clearance revoked. His political views, and second-thoughts about the destructive power he unleashed on the world, pitted him against his military bosses and founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Those events provide fodder for the film’s other section, the austere black-and-white “Fusion.” An adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird, the three-hour “Oppenheimer” is as downbeat as its weekend competition “Barbie” is upbeat. Nolan takes his time with the telling of the tale, weaving together the scientific, psychological and political story threads to create rich tapestry that transcends the talky nature of the script. He teases great drama and tension out of a story that is essentially, a retelling of two tribunals, punctuated by the big bang that would change history. Much of the film’s success is owed to Murphy, who, despite reciting teams of dialogue, goes internal to portray Oppenheimer’s towering intellect. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema frames Murphy’s stoic face in wide screen close-ups that showcase the actor’s ability to expose not only the character’s great intelligence, but also the realization that the power he spearheaded wouldn’t be fully understood until it was too late. The Trinity Test sequence, the depiction of first detonation of a nuclear weapon, is a masterclass of less is more filmmaking. Nolan expertly builds tension with a countdown clock and Ludwig Göransson’s anxiety inducing soundtrack, but it is the look of scientific accomplishment tempered by an accompanying moral reckoning that spreads across Murphy’s face the moment the bomb goes off that cuts to the film’s core theme of innovation vs. consequences. Murphy is supported by an a-list cast, including Matt Damon, who exudes movie star charisma and Downey Jr, who erases memories of Tony Stark with a blustery performance that, Marvel aside, is his most interesting since “Zodiac.” The real star, however, is Nolan. “Oppenheimer” is the director firing on all cylinders, delivering a personal story of responsibility made epic. The brainiest blockbuster of the season is a period piece about a man who moral conundrums regarding power and the way it is wielded, that resonates just as loudly today as they did when the events took place.

"Jul 20, 2023"," To say, “It’s J. Robert Oppenheimer's world and we just live in it,” might sound facile, glib, or even the punchline to an unfunny, bewildering joke, but it’s as true today as it was on July 16, 1945, the day the Manhattan Project, the super-secret, U.S.-funded military-scientific research team, detonated the first atomic bomb in Los Alamos, New Mexico. In a moment of self-reflection, Oppenheimer dubbed the atomic bomb “Trinity,” not for the three-in-one God (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit) of the Christian faith, but for a favorite John Donne poem.


Later, Oppenheimer, not one to shy away from self-aggrandizement, claimed the words from the Bhagavad Gita, “I am Shiva; destroyer of words,” came to him in that awesome, awful moment. Whenever it was actually said, Oppenheimer recognized, not for the first time nor that last, that the atomic bomb changed the world in irrevocable ways. For a brief period, it made the United States the world’s first nuclear power. For much longer, it was the beginning of a nuclear arms race between the United States and the former Soviet Union. In less than two decades, the U.S., joined by its European allies, and the Soviet Union, joined, not by political agreement, but by force, by its nominal, Eastern European allies, developed nuclear arsenals that destroy the world many times over (mutual assured destruction or MAD by another name).  


All of that, of course, serves as context, backdrop, and background for Christopher Nolan’s (Interstellar, Inception, The Prestige) latest film, Oppenheimer, an adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “American Prometheus.” Shot like most of his previous films in Nolan’s favorite format, 70mm/IMAX, Oppenheimer primarily unfolds across three intertwined time periods, one focused on a Senate confirmation hearing for commerce secretary involving Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), Oppenheimer’s onetime ally turned antagonist; not atypical “scenes from a life” set between the mid-1920s through the mid-1960s; and the 1954 security clearance hearing before a biased board of the Atomic Energy Commission. The result of that hearing led to Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) effective removal from governmental policy-making or political influence. Haltingly, nervously, Oppenheimer reads from a prepared statement, essentially setting up what appears to be a traditional, years-spanning biography of a “great man.”


Except the “great man” that emerges here, for all of his accomplishments as a theoretical physicist and team leader of the Manhattan Project, isn’t a mythological, god-like figure. He’s a deeply, flawed, egotistical, self-centered, entitled man, driven to physical, emotional, and mental extremes by personal ambition, riven with self-doubt at practically every key turning point. He’s a man defined by complexity and contradiction. Recognizing the inevitability of the atomic bomb — along with the possibility, even likelihood, of Nazi Germany developing one first — Oppenheimer sets aside his left-leaning preoccupations, including most of his friends and associates who identified themselves as Communists or joined the American Communist Party, to lead the Manhattan Project.


While we, looking back across almost a century of time, have the benefit of history, not to mention dramatic irony, Oppenheimer doesn’t. His self-belief powers him through a series of personal and existential crises, the ethical implications of the atomic bomb, including its potential usage against civilian populations, and the post-war anti-communist hysteria that would derail academic and professional careers across America, to make himself, above all, useful to the war effort.


Working forward in time from Oppenheimer’s post-college studies at Cambridge, where he infamously almost poisoned an instructor, and moving forward through a burgeoning academic career in Berkeley, California (then as until recently, a hotbed of leftist activism), Oppenheimer (the film) charts not just the title character’s success as a brilliant theoretician and dynamic instructor, foreshadowing his leadership of the Manhattan Project, but also — in fleetingly brief, broad strokes — the women who also helped to define and shape him as an individual: Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), practically as bright and brilliant as Oppenheimer and, at least here, presented as his first, great love, and Katherine Puening (Emily Blunt), his future wife.


Unsurprisingly given Nolan’s underwhelming track record with female characters, both Jean and Kitty get remarkably little screen time and what screen time they do get functions primarily in service of Oppenheimer’s narrative and character arc. Where the mercurial Jean offers sensual risks and rewards, Kitty offers safety and security. In their own ways, however, both pay a significant personal price for their association with Oppenheimer. In the Intentional or not, it’s still a narrative weakness, though given Nolan’s obsessive focus on Oppenheimer — perhaps mirroring his own obsessions as a filmmaker and filmmaking — it’s far from surprising.


It’s only slightly more surprising that the other scientists who surround Oppenheimer, numbering at least five or six by one count, won Nobel Prizes, seem to pale or shrink in comparison. Even when they’re physically more imposing, like Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), the future founder of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, they seem like smaller, pettier men, focused far too much on immediate practical or professional problems and not enough on the macro-level, on the logistics of organizing and leading scientists and engineers from disparate disciplines into a cohesive team capable of outracing the Germans (who, as we’re reminded here, had an 18-month head start). They lack the “vision” thing shared by Oppenheimer and by extension, Nolan himself.


Oppenheimer never received a Nobel Prize for his work before, during, or after the Second World War. For a man credited as “the father of the atomic bomb,” it would have been an unlikely accomplishment, but in seeing Trinity and later, in recognizing, however haltingly and incompletely, the human toll of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the doubts and — in Nolan’s telling and in contemporaneous accounts — a suffocating, debilitating sense of guilt for having unleashed a weapon of mass destruction unlike anything in human history. That he warned against a nuclear arms race, that he advocated for international controls of nuclear materials and arms agreements with the Soviet Union and other nuclear-capable nation-states, did little to assuage that guilt.


It did, however, result in the revival of questions about his loyalty to the United States, specifically during the Red Scare-McCarthyite Era of the post-war years. Given Oppenheimer’s open sympathy and support for leftist causes and associations with self-identifying communists (treated neutrally by Nolan here), it was inevitable he too would suffer the wrath of war hawks in both political parties. He didn’t see the inevitable points to a kind of willful blindness or ignorance, a man who saw himself as a truth-talker regardless of the consequences, a prophet of sorts (as someone rightly points out). That he forgot or chose to forget what happens to most prophets (i.e., rejection and exile) makes his story a uniquely American one, a uniquely American tragedy.


Nolan captures that American tragedy through an often harrowing combination of close-ups of Oppenheimer’s face, dazzling, disorientating shots of stars and atoms exploding (a mirror presumably of Oppenheimer’s ruminations), and expansive, widescreen vistas of the Los Alamos, New Mexico town and the surrounding desert and mountains. It’s rare, however, for Nolan to venture outside classrooms, hearing rooms, or the interiors of homes, in turn creating a claustrophobic, voyeuristic sense of intimacy with Oppenheimer. That, in turn, places extra emphasis and stress on Murphy’s performance. Not expressive for some, but more than expressive enough for others (if not most), it’s the kind of revelatory performance that will likely lead to the usual assortment of year-end awards nominations, speeches, and tears, but if it does, it’ll only be because it was well-deserved.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," A common refrain from those who approach film-going a certain way is, “I don’t know who to like in this story.” We instinctively expect a good guy, a bad guy and a neat narrative. Not surprisingly, Christopher Nolan puts us on a more challenging road in Oppenheimer, the story of the “Father of the A-bomb,” who became both a national hero and (during the Red Scare) a pariah, in the process of ending a war and regretfully igniting a generations-long nuclear arms race. At three dense hours of mostly dialogue and murky motivation, Oppenheimer demands commitment and tests patience as we follow a brilliant but difficult-to-like protagonist (a mesmerizing Cillian Murphy).  By the time Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) puts J. Robert Oppenheimer in charge of the Manhattan Project, damning him personally as a “dilettante and a womanizer,” we already know this to be true. Murphy’s Oppenheimer is arrogant, often clueless about people, makes bad personal decisions, treats the women in his life badly and can be a hypocrite on moral grounds. (A leftist and self-proclaimed sympathizer for the common man, he objects to the marriage of a physicist and a waitress. I’m guessing he wouldn’t have been a fan of  the sitcom The Big Bang Theory). He also displays mentally questionable aberrant behavior, at one point leaving a poisoned apple for a professor who’d banned him from a lecture by Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) for his poor lab work. On the flip side, Oppenheimer’s prodigy status attracts the attention of men like Bohr, Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), who propel his status. (Bohr sets him on a lifelong path by comparing quantum physics to music). But as problematic a protagonist as Oppenheimer is, he is surrounded by arguably worse people of unclear motives and, in some cases, obvious malice. Oppenheimer opens with a post-war “trial” that is not a trial, a Senate committee looking at the man’s life and any excuse to deny his security clearance and effectively end his career. The motivation: After Hiroshima and Nagasaki – which he didn’t object to before the fact – he became a proponent for peace and an opponent of the development of the “Super Bomb,” a.k.a. the H Bomb. H-bomb creator Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) is played here as a bitter, unprincipled, ambitious man, which is kinder than his public image as a Bond villain (Stanley Kubrick is said to have based the character of Dr. Strangelove on him). Nolan doesn’t mess with our heads like he did in Tenet. His “time jumps” from the ‘30s to the ‘50s are of the traditional narrative kind, involving make-up, and in some cases, black-and-white scenes to give the latter a more Edward R. Murrow ‘50s news feel.  He picked the right actor to show in close-up for hours on end. Murphy’s face is both haunted and enigmatic. For a man who led the life he did, becoming the de facto mayor of the secret research town of Los Alamos, in charge of a $2 billion project (in ‘40s money), he is virtually never seen as happy. And the star-laden cast is up to the task. Damon’s Gen. Groves is fully aware when he hires him that Oppenheimer has associated with Communists and leftists (including the love of his life, Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh). He considers it insurance if he ever needs to pull the reins on his ego-driven physicist. An almost-unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr.. plays the key character of Lewis Strauss, chair of the Atomic Energy Commission, who had been Oppenheimer’s early supporter, turned consumingly jealous antagonist. In a movie that seldom rises above a certain emotional level, Downey ultimately gets the big rage scenes. Pugh and Emily Blunt (who plays Oppenheimer’s less-loved wife) don’t really get to carry much drama, but play their thankless roles with as much commitment as anyone else in the cast.  To be clear, Oppenheimer is three hours of testimony played out as drama. There are no action scenes as such, besides pyro played on the quantum and city-destroying level. It is the opposite of escapism, but it’s real history worth telling.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 20, 2023"," La conciencia puede ser un martirio. Christopher Nolan dedica 180 minutos a Julius Robert Oppenheimer, el físico judío estadounidense que durante la II Guerra Mundial diseñó el programa de armas nucleares y desencadenó el lanzamiento de dos bombas atómicas en las ciudades japonesas Hiroshima y Nagasaki. Y en una filmografía pródiga en envolturas fantásticas y saltos temporales, tipo Inception, Interestellar y la trilogía de Batman, a menudo incidiendo en la memoria perdida y la perturbación psíquica como en Insomnia, Memento y su ópera prima Following, lo apretuja en uno de los relatos de mayor linealidad y angustia verídica que ha dirigido. Oppenheimer es un alma desesperada que anda por la película primero cual explorador ansioso, luego heraldo negro y finalmente deudo de su propio talento, acorralado por fantasmas introspectivos y ajenos que están indistinta y alternadamente a su favor o en contra. Nolan, altamente inspirado, muestra a su personaje en múltiples trayectorias paralelas, entrecortadas y revisadas desde el futuro retrospectivo ingrato y sombrío, en medio del zigzag profesional y amoroso, la investigación de átomos, neutrones, elementos y compuestos; el roce receloso con sus colegas, piruetas políticas, pragmatismos ideológicos, el liderazgo en la base de Los Álamos, el espanto posterior. ¿Y de qué manera lo graba? Concentrado en la figura huesuda de Cillian Murphy, paulatinamente pálida y consumida, rodeada de encierros, grandes planos generales, penumbras, desenfoques y blancuras que obnubilan la vista y deforman los cuerpos de los involucrados en las intrigas del poder, representando que también se exponen a los efectos de la radiactividad. Los hallazgos de la élite del conocimiento se insertan en forma de latigazos escarlatas de microscopio, en una carrera contra el reloj, la paz y la vocación humanista. El ritmo es vertiginoso y los diálogos son abundantes, haciendo recordar los mejores momentos del cine de Oliver Stone, en Wall Street, JFK o Nixon. Hay algo oscuro, inseparable, amalgamado, en Oppenheimer. Nolan habla del pasado y lo asocia al presente continuo. Con la perspectiva de la postverdad actual vemos criaturas del siglo XX en búsqueda de sus peculiares certezas y seguridades. Es el relato de una construcción, que Robert experimenta en su trayectoria individual, y corporativa para la hegemonía de la primera potencia. Y a la vez de una destrucción, concreta y emblemática, no sólo de un enemigo del Eje -al principio aparentemente Alemania y que termina siendo su socio Japón-, sino de la humanidad y del legado de siglos de ciencia. Un compañero suyo se lamenta y se resigna ante la convicción de Robert de no tener escapatoria: es cuestión de tiempo, el que hoy ya parece escaso para la especie, la fabricación de la bomba nuclear por los nazis y eso sería lo peor, el mal mayor (término muy familiar en el Perú actual). «Soy un destructor de mundos», dice el protagonista trágico. El teniente general Leslie Groves (tensionado Matt Damon), encargado militar del proyecto, husmea las consecuencias del plan, sin completa certidumbre de lo que podría pasar. ¿El mundo entero podría destruirse por una abrasadora reacción en cadena? El científico responde con honestidad y formalidad profesional, alejado de los peores miedos, y el uniformado asume irónico el riesgo. Son los gajes del oficio. Los contrastes se lucen especialmente en la lectura de Nolan. El nacionalismo jubiloso estadounidense que atraviesa 250 años de hostilidades hasta su desaforada versión ‘trumpista’ de hoy, va de la mano de la pesadumbre de Robert; el cumplimiento del deber alterna con su inestabilidad sentimental y la persecución enloquecida del macartismo es una mueca sardónica que deja la postguerra. A la luz de los aplastantes hechos que dieron el triunfo a los Aliados, se analizan incidencias en comparación menores de las relaciones amicales y posturas públicas y privadas del investigado que podrían haber sido una traición a los intereses de Estados Unidos, justamente victorioso por el ataque más implacable de la historia. Los interrogatorios en un apretado espacio oficinesco transitan de la diligencia formal al absurdo y de los procedimientos legales al cinismo político. El precozmente envejecido Oppenheimer, en la época en que guionistas de Hollywood inscritos en listas negras usaban seudónimos y que hoy hacen huelga, debe contestar a suposiciones contrafácticas, a los «hubiera» delirantes de grises acusadores, como si se pudiera volver al pasado y reescribirlo.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," “It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they are found because it was possible to find them.” An early monologue outlines the process of dying stars — cooling and collapsing before consuming everything in their gravitational demise … even light. Through text slapped onscreen and spoken aloud, writer-director Christopher Nolan wastes no time invoking the fire-stealing, rock-chained Prometheus as a progenitor for the brand of punishment visited upon J. Robert Oppenheimer — whose successful development of an atomic bomb hastened the end of World War II in horrific fashion, introduced a million-fold multiplier to the planet’s military-industrial complex, and affixed itself as an albatross on his anxieties for the remaining two decades of his life. Neither does Nolan tarry in dispatching the many hungry eagles of Washington, D.C., eager to metaphorically feast on Oppenheimer’s liver — regrown perhaps not overnight as in the myth of old but certainly during convenient moments of political expediency. Doesn’t exactly sound like the escapism you’d presume from the impresario who made three good to great Batman movies, time-, space- and mind-bending works like Tenet, Interstellar and Inception, and the raw-nerved, race-against-the-clock war reenactment of Dunkirk.  Nolan is certainly aware of the uphill battle faced by an R-rated, three-hour historical biopic … that is also   partially in black and white … and which boasts atypical scientific density, a real-world nuclear act of war and arguably the greatest ethical reckoning of the 20th century. As such, Nolan approaches it like an elegy played on electric guitar — hitting the whammy bar so often it might fall off but also so skillfully that you recognize: The excess emphasizes the essential, and frighteningly enduring, nature of this story. The filmmaker’s traditional time distortion has been deployed to a more delirious effect than you’d expect in a film far more concerned with conversation and interrogation than detonation. Naturally, it chronicles Oppenheimer’s swift rise and seemingly endless fall, embodied here in a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy. His piercing blue eyes plumb perpetually fascinating depths of vulnerability, virility and vacancy within the mind that moved the Earth. Note also how his entire physical countenance shifts when he arrives in Los Alamos, the site of atomic testing and a fabricated town where he fancies himself founder, mayor and sheriff. It echoes how T.E. Lawrence was seduced and swallowed by a different desert — the same lanky frame, the same certainty of purpose, the same lost way. Nolan’s insistent closeups convey the harried, hollowed husk left behind in the wake of Oppenheimer’s success, and the peaks and valleys of Murphy’s impeccable cheekbones are sized like monuments you expect to see Tom Cruise skittering across. Nolan dovetails Oppenheimer’s story with the political aspirations of U.S. Navy Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), whose post-WWII association with Oppenheimer included a shared stint on an advisory committee of the United States’ Atomic Energy Commission and his appointment of Oppenheimer as director of the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study. It’s enthralling to see Downey dig into something different after his retirement as Tony Stark (even as Strauss’s real-life arc tips the slightest cap to Iron Man 3), and Nolan affords him no end of dynamite dynamics; this may be the most satisfying purely dramatic part that Downey has yet played. Plus, after Good Night, and Good Luck, it’s a treat to see a face made for black-and-white once again infuse monochromatic schemes with such vivid emotional color. Oppenheimer tracks these men’s inverse fortunes across nearly 40 years — from the title character’s days as a doctoral candidate drifting into recklessness to his 1963 receipt of the Enrico Fermi Award. Amid various stages of his own political career, John F. Kennedy plays a pivotal role in the final word on each man’s story. Unsurprisingly, Oppenheimer shares the DNA of Oliver Stone’s JFK. The editorial rhythms similarly skitter about while always providing seamless service to the story. Each and every swerve from the ecstasy of inspiration to the agony of inquisition cuts to the quick. This is simply masterful work from editor Jennifer Lame, reuniting with Nolan after Tenet and infusing the film’s final hour — nearly all of which finds people being grilled by one committee or another — with all the urgency of the Caped Crusader trying to save Gotham City. It also musters the same roaring anger at what the historical record hath wrought for the rest of mankind, with arguably even more famous faces popping up onscreen. But Oppenheimer isn’t just a three-hour expansion of the DiCaprio-leaning-forward meme with these performers, either. Countless more deliver meaningful work in even the most minor of roles. That’s largely because Nolan’s screenplay is also generous in its regard for scientific discourse and divergence among so many luminaries … while also remembering that even the most brilliant people on the planet are still human and can thus be carpetbagging trolls, disloyal partners, self-serving reprobates and shitbirds with grudges. Oppenheimer finds himself in opposition to all of these types … and indeed to those own tendencies within himself.  Not for nothing are the scientist’s fascinations with Picasso and Stravinsky invoked; this man craved a similar mantle of inspiration at a cost unclear to him until he incurred a debt he could never resolve. Wielding his formidable intellect like a blade works for Oppenheimer until he brings it to the proverbial gunfight of the American military’s Manhattan Project. Coming aboard as its scientific director, Oppenheimer saw the chance to mold heretofore frustrating abstractions of his theoretical work into something practical, tangible and grimly purposeful, as well as to lead a project in the rural New Mexican splendor he loved. Mercifully, Oppenheimer forgoes the sort of footnote filmmaking that a failed effort would entail. Nolan wastes little time on dizzying, distracting explanations of Oppenheimer’s knowledge. The specificity of Oppenheimer’s intellect is immaterial. If not Oppenheimer, it would have been someone else. And as it’s said in his snappily written introduction to U.S. Army Colonel Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), genius is a given among this group. Instead, Nolan uses his canvas to convey Oppenheimer’s attunement to alternative wavelengths and vibrations — dropping the viewer amid exponential explosions inside Oppenheimer’s mind palace for nigh-synesthetic interludes at which he envisions pulling at the threads of physics.  These visions provide powerful conflations of his exhaustive obsessions, and they are among the numerous necessities of IMAX-sized immersion in Oppenheimer. (This reviewer was fortunate enough to screen in 70mm IMAX at one of only 30 such theaters worldwide.) The same goes for vast, vision-filling vistas of the Los Alamos testing site and the Trinity sequence, which depicts America’s inaugural test of its atomic capabilities. Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema frame the former like a splendor on the verge of manmade spoilage and the latter like a pillar of portent no one involved can truly see. As rendered in IMAX, the sequence pins you flat. But so do the many crystalline moments of spectacle that come from the specificity and nuance of emotional performance — captured with utmost clarity by the camera and unswerving authenticity by the cast. (It’s so mesmerizing that even temple-squeezing tension on the bows of President Harry Truman’s glasses say something crucial about him.) Oppenheimer also represents a high point of sonic storytelling for Nolan. Oft derided for leaving discernible dialogue dead in a ditch, Nolan understands that the words about the deeds are important here. In turn, Oscar-winning sound designer Richard King forces focus as much on the absence of volume as its insistent, often-martial presence — with soundscapes as creatively thoughtful, layered and terrifying as the script’s themes, particularly in a separated juxtaposition of different babies’ screams that herald the hell to come. There are grace notes, too, including the everyday din of Washington, D.C. continuing to churn outside while lives are chewed up and spat out in small, dingy rooms. This is also a film with at least 150 minutes of music, all astonishing, from Oscar-winning composer Ludwig Göransson. His compositions crescendo from electronic warbles and scratches at the known fabric of scientific understanding to the inescapable momentum of chemical reactions and, finally, into a lament and mournfulness akin to Krzysztof Penderecki’s Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima. If there are any missteps, it is Oppenheimer’s heavy flirtation with Nolan’s traditionally flimsy female characters. They are perhaps reduced for too long to simple salvation or doomsaying, at least before the third act turns Blunt loose for a series of terrific spotlight scenes as Oppenheimer’s spouse, Katherine. Much has also been made of the film’s sexual content (a rarity for Nolan) regarding Oppenheimer and his recurring affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Over-reported for clickbait, these encounters are mostly modulated until a bit of orgasmic hallucination that renders a moment in Munich by Steven Spielberg (also often sex-averse) subtle by comparison. It’s also the only break in a volley of perspective between Oppenheimer and Strauss, which makes the bit even more of a head-scratcher. And yet these are minor misgivings for a film about people who confused temporary observation of Olympus with occupation, and where the titular subject’s pursuit of penance plays at the pace of a thriller. While developing the atomic bomb, Oppenheimer reaches out to many scientific luminaries. It’s less for an independent affirmation of his findings and more for a preemptive absolution of what they will mean. And while Nolan’s resolution arrives at a point of catharsis, neither does it let Oppenheimer off the hook. If anything, it simply affords him the courtesy of choosing the hook on which he should hang.  An electrifying existential treatise. A warning about the thin line between delusion and destruction. A wearily wise work that understands writing history means etching your epitaph well before you expire. Oppenheimer is a rhapsodic, attention-snaring example of all these — joining the ranks of great epics that throw you into a rumble seat of history and the horrors it has yielded.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," With Oppenheimer, director Christopher Nolan steps
away from the action/adventure core that has been his bread-and-butter and opts
instead to channel his inner David Lean. Despite being overlong and unevenly
paced, Oppenheimer contains moments of greatness and features one of the
most compelling lead performances (by Cillian Murphy) in recent memory.
Unfortunately, some of Nolan’s less admirable tendencies remain in evidence. Some
of the artsy visuals (including black-and-white sequences and intercutting with
kaleidoscopic images) feel more self-indulgent than organic. The incessant
musical score becomes intrusive, especially during the first half. Sound mixing
issues once again cause dialogue to be drowned out upon occasion.  Over the nearly 80 years since Oppenheimer became a household
name, the media has written, re-written, and scrubbed his reputation to suit
the wants and needs of various military and political agendas. Initially a hero
when his role as the “father of the atom bomb” became known, his sterling image
was tarnished by Cold War rumors of ties to the Soviet Union. He lived under an
uncertain cloud for the better part of a decade until his receipt of the Enrico
Fermi Award in 1963 brought him full circle. Nolan’s film addresses this period
of Oppenheimer’s life, shifting backward and forward in time as suits the narrative
trajectory.  Oppenheimer hones in on three primary periods and
fills in the blanks with various flashbacks and flashforwards. The jigsaw puzzle
structure enables the movie to keep from becoming trapped in the linear
chronology regurgitation that hamstrings many bio-pics. Arguably, however, it limits
identification with Oppenheimer. A framing device is established during the
1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing that revoked Oppenheimer’s security clearance.
A majority of the movie’s running time focuses on the establishment of the Manhattan
Project and the events leading up to Trinity in July 1945. The third element of
Oppenheimer (the one presented in black-and-white) takes place during the
1959 Senate confirmation hearings for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the
one-time director of the AEC who was largely responsible for Oppenheimer’s fall
from grace. Certain relationships – in particular, the ones between
Oppenheimer and his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his long-time mistress, Jean
Tatlock (Florence Pugh) – are underwritten and would have benefitted from additional
development. Likewise, many of the scientists involved with the Manhattan
Project may seem largely interchangeable to those unfamiliar with their famous
names. Oppenheimer’s crowning sequence is the 20-minute
lead-up to the atomic bomb test codenamed Trinity. This is Nolan at his best,
building suspense (at the time, there were concerns about a “near zero” chance
that an uncontrolled chain reaction could destroy the world) up to the moment
then delivering the climax in an historically accurate but unconventional
fashion.  Interwoven with the development of the title character’s
life story is the moral quagmire that has dogged science since time immemorial but
has become more immediate in recent decades: how to decouple the discoveries of
science with the ways in which they are appropriated by non-scientists.
Oppenheimer’s views evolve over the course of the film. Initially a theorist, he
is seduced by the possibilities of the discovery and testing. When forced to
confront the implications of a post-atomic world (complete with waking-nightmare
images of the human toll), he comes to understand the warnings of Albert Einstein
(Tom Conti) and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). Cillian Murphy’s amazing work will immediately cement him as
an Oscar front-runner. His unsmiling, haunted interpretation of the tortured physicist
is Shakespearean. When he utters the famous quote (“I am become Death, the destroyer
of worlds”), it is with the horror of recognition. Unlike many psychologically
conflicted characters, Oppenheimer is never made more palatable increase viewer
affinity. He is cold and his underrealized relationships with the two women in
his life offer little in the way of warmth. Even when presented naked, there is
no vulnerability – only unapproachability. Nolan is such a revered director that he can cast pretty much
anyone he wants, even if the role is small. To that end, luminaries such as
Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, and Kenneth Branagh all make supporting
contributions (for Damon and Branagh, theses are return engagements). Robert
Downey Jr., hidden underneath convincing aging makeup, provides the closest thing
that Oppenheimer offers to a villain. Aside from Murphy, who is in about
90% of the scenes, Downey Jr. and Damon have the most screen time. Cameos are
provided by a pair of Oscar winners: Casey Affleck (as the creepy Boris Pash)
and Gary Oldman (as Harry Truman). With Oppenheimer, Nolan has turned back the clock to
movies like Gandhi, Patton, and Lawrence of Arabia – motion
picture spectacles that tell the story of a well-known (and often controversial)
historical icon without worrying too much about running time. But a key difference
can’t be discounted: the importance of an intermission. All those earlier films
had one and it proved to be critical in maintaining audience attentiveness (not
to mention managing bladder capacity). It’s possible to keep an audience in thrall
for three hours with an action-oriented film but “action” is not in Oppenheimer’s
DNA. The lack of an intermission is a disservice to viewers and the movie. Oppenheimer is an indication that Nolan refuses to be
pigeonholed as a director. While there’s something to be admired about that, this
isn’t a home run. Still, many of the flaws are more than compensated for by the
flashes of brilliance and the strength of the central character’s presentation.
This is not peak Nolan – it pales in comparison with the likes of The Dark Knight and Interstellar – but it is one of the most intriguing high-budget
films of 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," In “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan takes an eggheady topic and, without insulting anyone’s intelligence, turns it into a gut-level experience. He shows that the kind of hyper, jacked-up, ultramodern filmmaking associated with the action and superhero genres can be harnessed in the service of a smart, serious movie. This is as supercharged as any of Nolan’s genre movies, such as his Batman “Dark Knight” trilogy, but this time Nolan is lavishing three hours on the life of a theoretical physicist. J. Robert Oppenheimer, known as the “father of the atomic bomb,” is the subject, and Nolan isn’t just concentrating on the atomic bomb drama, but on the man’s thoughts, feelings, relationships and postwar difficulties. Yet not a minute of the movie is less than interesting, and much of it is riveting. “Oppenheimer” feels as though it were put together intuitively. It zigzags through the scientist’s story, showing him interchangeably as a student, as the victim of a postwar investigation and as a professor at UC Berkeley (where he and his colleagues have the good sense to read The Chronicle). The investigation — a 1954 hearing to determine whether to renew his federal security clearance — is the movie’s spine, giving Nolan license to introduce topics and bounce through time in all directions. The Oppenheimer we find here is a strange guy, a man of science as driven as the most passionate artist. He’s too smart to sleep, tormented by visions of the cosmos, and, as played by Cillian Murphy (“Peaky Blinders,” Nolan’s “Batman Begins”), who became almost skeletal for the role, he’s too smart to eat.  His point of connection with the audience is his integrity. He really does seem to care about the people in his life — his friends, family, including his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), who worked with him on the Manhattan Project and later founded the Exploratorium in San Francisco — and humankind in general. All this, and he has a really good look too, kind of like David Bowie in his Thin White Duke period, only 30 years earlier and with the addition of a porkpie hat. If you’re trying to figure out how to blow up the world, you might as well look cool doing it. The story the film tells is enormous. Oppenheimer, who has the privilege and burden of being one of the smartest people in the world, realizes the potential for nuclear weapons before most people, but not before at least one Nazi scientist. By the time he is appointed director of the Manhattan Project, tasked with creating the first atomic bomb, the United States is in a mortal game of catch-up. Realizing it would be difficult to recruit the best scientists if they had to leave their families, he builds Los Alamos from scratch, a New Mexico community that serves as his base of operations. There, Oppenheimer is placed under the command of Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves, and the two men are a study of contrasts: an intelligent normal man in charge of an eccentric genius.  It’s Groves’ challenge, beautifully played by Matt Damon, to figure out when to trust his own judgment and when to trust Oppenheimer. The complicating factor is that Oppenheimer is not always right. He’s naive when it comes to the Soviets, and he has close friendships with American communists, including a troubled romance with a neurotic party member played by Florence Pugh. Oppenheimer seems to have been attracted to fierce women, which means juicy roles for Pugh and for Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s wife. In fact, there are many small, vivid roles in “Oppenheimer,” such that three different best actor Academy Award winners — Rami Malek, Casey Affleck and Gary Oldman — have one good scene each. The latter, who played Winston Churchill in “The Darkest Hour,” is President Harry Truman here. If Oldman ever plays Stalin, he could do the Potsdam Conference as a one-man show. “Oppenheimer” also provides an opportunity for audiences to remember that Robert Downey Jr. is an actor, and not just a self-parody in superhero movies. Maybe it was a chance for Downey to remember too. In a superb portrayal of small-minded spite, he plays Lewis Strauss, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission who, out of jealousy, became Oppenheimer’s nemesis. More than most movies, “Oppenheimer” is difficult to describe in words. Nolan uses color for the early scenes and black and white for the later scenes, and throughout, the movie is so vigorously directed, not only in terms of sight but also sound, that probably the best a critic can do is point you toward the experience and say, “It’s that.” Still, the one thing that must be highlighted is the sheer, utter brilliance of Nolan’s depiction of the first atomic bomb detonation. Nolan brings everything to bear on this sequence, stretching out moments, increasing the sound, wiping out the sound, and taking time to bask in the horrifying beauty of the destruction. What marks him as an artist, and not just a dazzling technician, is that amid the sound and fury, we feel the moral implications of the moment in all their awful complexity.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," PLOT The story of the father of the atomic bomb.CAST Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr.RATED R (nudity, language, adult themes)LENGTH 3:00WHERE Area theatersBOTTOM LINE Christopher Nolan goes for IMAX-sized grandeur in this biopic, but it’s the stellar cast that makes it compelling.
  Were people ever so naïve? They were, Oppenheimer among them. If Nolan’s dense, three-hour epic teaches us anything about its subject, it’s that even the most visionary minds have their blind spots. Based on “American Prometheus,” Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's 721-page, Pulitzer-winning biography published in 2005, “Oppenheimer” tells the story of a theoretical physicist who ushered in the nuclear age but couldn’t see the political signposts that would lead to his eventual downfall.   Nolan builds the movie around the Trinity test-blast (he even recreated the bunker and drop-tower in the New Mexico desert) and it’s a visceral vision of hellfire, achieved without CGI and captured by cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Still, the story’s real richness lies in Oppenheimer’s messy personal life, and to that end his acquaintances are played by many of the best actors around (so many, in fact, that Rami Malek, Casey Affleck and other Oscar winners appear in split-second roles). The clear standout is Robert Downey, Jr., as the calculating politician Lewis Strauss, while a close second is Matt Damon as the no-nonsense brigadier general Leslie Groves (director of the Manhattan Project).   There’s some truth in the notion that, like the fire-bearing Prometheus, Oppenheimer gave mankind an awesome new power but received punishment instead of thanks. On a less mythical note, things might have gone better for this celebrated genius if he’d just learned to read a room and kiss the right rings. However you choose to view “Oppenheimer,” it’s the picture of a man who reaped everything he sowed. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Brilliantly directed and written by Christopher Nolan, his first biopic about the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” is his magnum opus. He not only delivers a fascinating historical drama on the genius theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer’s research and development, but he has crafted it like a big-stakes psychological thriller with many pieces of a puzzle becoming clear over its three-hour runtime. Based on the 2005 Pulitzer Prize-winning book, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan’s adaptation focuses primarily on the scientist’s rise in the hallowed halls of revered institutions, the U.S. government’s interest in his quantum mechanics work, directing the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, his role in organizing the Manhattan Project, and the aftermath of building a nuclear weapon. This erudite character study explains much in its sharp dialogue that didn’t feel heavy or highbrow, and thanks to the actors’ snappy delivery, naturalistic.  Nolan’s verbal dexterity is crucial to this becoming edge-of-your-seat good instead of an academic exercise, and through meticulous detail, infuses a compelling biography with big-picture questions. Nolan has created some of the best films of the 21st century since “Memento” in 2000, and is known for his cerebral storytelling, nonlinear style, and visual mastery. Oscar-nominated five times for picture and director for “Dunkirk,” picture and screenplay for “Inception” and screenplay for “Memento,” his films have won mostly technical awards. He has thrilled with his Batman trilogy, impressed with “The Prestige,” and confounded with “Tenet” and “Interstellar,” gaining a fervent fan base. While weaving a grand-scale intricate narrative that flashes back and forward across decades, Nolan creates tension that leads to the “Trinity” code-name bomb-testing that’s one of the most astonishing sequences ever captured on film as he manipulates sight and sound for the Big Bang. After the bomb is used and the government takes it over from there, the film raises issues about actions causing reactions, scientific advancement, and government responsibility as Oppenheimer is swept into the maelstrom of moral, ethical, and political debates unleashed after the bomb’s use to end World War II. The story is framed with an unsettling hearing in 1954, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, which stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance, a kangaroo court depicting the post-war Red Scare paranoia. With his leftist leanings, connections to people that were avowed (past) Communists, and fretting over nuclear proliferation, he was accused of being a Soviet spy and became an unfortunate scapegoat. Nolan uses this backroom thrashing as a look back, intertwining science with politics by effectively alternating color and black-and-white film. It’s a master storyteller at the peak of his craft. A key element is a mega-cast that features everyone giving their all, creating authentic portraits of people that played a part in history, from Alden Ehrenreich depicting a Senate aide to British actor Tom Conti unrecognizable as Albert Einstein and Gary Oldman’s sly work as President Harry S Truman in one scene. A longtime fan of Cillian Murphy, I’m happy to see the Irish actor finally taking center stage in a part that seems tailor-made for him, and he’s on screen nearly the entire time. It’s such a virtuoso lived-in portrait, his career best, and he superbly unfolds multiple layers – showing many facets of Oppenheimer’s personality. Murphy’s most well-known work is as crime boss Tommy Shelby in the Netflix series “Peaky Blinders” (2013-2022), which is about a gangster family in 1900s England. In 2002, he broke through in the Danny Boyle sci-fi masterpiece “28 Days Later,” and has been featured in six Nolan films, starting with “Batman Begins” in 2005 as DC Comics’ villain Dr. Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow. As the two complicated women in his life, Emily Blunt is bulldog-like in her support, portraying his alcoholic biologist wife Kitty, unapologetic as a stressed-out mom, and Florence Pugh is troubled longtime girlfriend, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock. Robert Downey Jr. stands out in a shrewd performance as Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and ambitious political climber, and Matt Damon is strong as General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project. Josh Hartnett, who fell off mainstream movie radar, roars back as pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence, who worked with Oppenheimer at University of California-Berkeley, and Benny Safdie is once again surprising as theoretical physicist Edward Teller, who disagreed with Oppie on the hydrogen bomb. A litany of recognizable actors portraying either scientists, military brass or support staff includes Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, Dane DeHaan, Tony Goldwyn, David Krumholtz, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, and Alex Wolff. You might also be familiar with Dylan Arnold, who plays Robert’s brother Frank Oppenheimer, Michael Angarano as good friend-physicist Robert Serber, David Dastmalchian as William Borden, who filed a complaint with the FBI, Gregory Jbara as Senate Chairman Magnuson, and Macon Blair as Oppenheimer’s defense attorney Lloyd Garrison. This film leaps to being either a frontrunner or contender in many awards categories, figuring into the year-end conversations. It will be in mine – considerations for film, director, adapted screenplay, lead actor, supporting actor (Downey), supporting actress (Blunt), cinematography, editing, music score, visual effects, production design, costumes, hair and makeup, and sound nominations.Nolan’s go-to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema, Oscar nominee for “Dunkirk” and showing his keen eye in “Nope,” reaches new heights here, groundbreaking actually. He shot the film partially in black-and-white, and in doing so, made history. In a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large-format film photography it includes, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black and white analogue photography. So that the sections of the movie could be shot in the same quality as the rest of the film, Kodak developed the first ever black and white film stock for IMAX. The artisan work is exceptional – especially Jennifer Lame’s decisive editing, and the sound editing and mixing technicians’ advanced capabilities (Richard King, Michael W. Mitchell, Kevin O’Connell, Gary A. Rizzo leading the way.) Luisa Abel’s expert makeup and prosthetic department’s aging visages appear realistic, and costume designer Ellen Mirojnick’s looks for tweedy academia, active soldiers, swanky party guests and ‘40s housewives are spot-on, factoring in desert, Northern California, and New England climates. Ruth De Jong’s production design spans decades and locations with accurate retro recreations, as Nolan moves from ‘20s grad school in Germany to ‘30s UC-Berkeley classrooms, to ‘40s Princeton, deserts and mountains, wartime New Mexico and McCarthy-era Washington D.C. “Oppenheimer” harkens back to those mammoth blockbusters of old, those sweeping epics filmed by David Lean that captured our fancy. It is rare to see a movie of this magnitude be this satisfying, but it is nuanced filmmaking at its finest. Go see this big-brained movie on the biggest screen possible. “Oppenheimer” is a 2023 drama-thriller-biography written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., and Florence Pugh. It is Rated R for some nudity, sexuality and language and runs 3 hours. It opens in theaters on July 21. Lynn’s Grade: A. Note: this review was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

"Jul 20, 2023"," How do you make an interesting three-hour biopic with characters mostly talking and debating? Or, more importantly, a movie that doesn’t end up with you checking your watch or phone’s clock app, wondering when is it going to be over. This got me thinking long before Christopher Nolan’s highly-anticipated latest feature of ‘Oppenheimer’ hits theaters in the same week with another potential box-office juggernaut ‘Barbie’, or better known as the ‘Barbenheimer’ phenomenon. ‘Oppenheimer,’ of course, refers to J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy in a rare leading turn in a Christopher Nolan’s film), the American theoretical physicist infamously responsible for creating the world’s first atomic bomb during World War II. Nolan previously tackled the World War II subject six years ago in ‘Dunkirk,’ which was uniquely told in a non-linear perspective from three locations takes place in land, air, and sea.  Whereas ‘Dunkirk’ is more of a minimalist action-oriented war drama, ‘Oppenheimer’ was an antithesis of that 2017 World War II epic – narratively dense and heavy with dialogues. At the hands of a lesser director, it’s easy to dismiss that ‘Oppenheimer’ would suffer from a bloated or heavy-handed runtime desperately needing tighter editing. Thankfully, this isn’t the case — well, most of it anyway — for Christopher Nolan, who again adopts a non-linear storytelling approach to tell his story (he received the sole writing credit inspired by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography of ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’). Nolan flipped his film back and forth between color and black and white, detailing the rise and fall of J. Robert Oppenheimer from his earlier days in the 1920s.  The period when then-young Oppenheimer is still a student majoring in physics. He gets to know the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh in an outstanding cameo appearance). Even in his younger days, Oppenheimer is seen as a lonely person with his mind regularly interrupted by fragmented visions of light, particles, and atoms. The movie also focuses on Oppenheimer and his team of physicists (among them played by Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, and Devon Bostick) being recruited to work on the Manhattan Project in the 1940s. It was a program that General Leslie Groves (a scene-stealing Matt Damon) oversaw everything from the research to the security related to the creation of the atomic bomb. The introduction of Damon’s General Leslie Groves and the race-against-time scenario of succeeding the first atomic bomb ever made showcases Nolan’s directorial flair of pacing his film like a ticking timebomb. A buildup that grows increasingly tense and suspenseful.  Coupled with Ludwig Göransson’s ominous score, we see Oppenheimer and his fellow physicists going into every possible detail, from theorizing in the subject matter of quantum physics to practically assembling an atomic bomb. This leads to the eventual and crucial first detonation of a nuclear test code-named Trinity set in the sweeping vistas of New Mexico’s Los Alamos desert. The atomic blast, which is reportedly executed practically with no CGI, is a visual marvel of the fiery big bang, blinding white light, mushroom cloud, and the sublime use of sound. The latter is where Nolan emphasized the most, combining loud and ear-shattering explosion effects with complete silence, highlighting Oppenheimer’s state of mind and sense of awe.  Hoyte van Hoytema, who has collaborated with Nolan since ‘Interstellar’ (2014), does a splendid job of shooting the film with IMAX cameras. His cinematography isn’t just epic in its visual spectacle but also profoundly intimate when it comes to capturing the characters’ facial expressions, mostly in close-ups.  This, in turn, allows Nolan to bring out the best in some of his actors, notably Cillian Murphy’s award-worthy role as J. Robert Oppenheimer. His expressive eyes speak a thousand words, and the way Murphy inhabits his real-life character results in a mesmerizing performance. Come Oscar time; it would be a crime not to place him as one of the frontrunners in the Best Actor category. While I’m glad Nolan finally gave Murphy a chance to lead his film after years of playing supporting roles since ‘Batman Begins,’ the rest of the all-star cast is no slouch either. Apart from the aforementioned Kenneth Branagh and Matt Damon, others such as Robert Downey Jr.’s sneakily manipulative Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) Chair Lewis Strauss and Jason Clarke’s no-nonsense Special Counsel Roger Robb deserve equal mentions.  And although ‘Oppenheimer’ is a predominantly male-centric film, Nolan also doesn’t forget to let the female co-stars shine. This is especially true with Emily Blunt, who plays Oppenheimer’s estranged, alcoholic wife, Kitty, while Florence Pugh made the best use of her limited screen time as Oppenheimer’s mistress, Jean Tatlock. Jennifer Lame’s crafty editing helps to keep the narrative flowing intriguingly. But once the Trinity nuclear test is over, the remainder of the film slips through the cracks. It’s not like the acting performances begin to dwindle, but more of Nolan’s arduous approach in depicting the aftermaths of the Trinity nuclear test and the subsequent atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that ultimately defeated the Japanese in World War II.  It was as if Nolan struggled to maintain a consistent momentum as the movie shifted focus to the controversial hearings revolving around Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss. But such a shortcoming remains forgivable, given the film’s compelling narrative structure and Nolan’s impressive use of sight and sound. Not to forget, great performances all around, making ‘Oppenheimer’ one of the best and must-see films of 2023.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Ya han pasado 25 años desde que firmó su interesantísimo debut 'Following', pero a día de hoy, con doce largometrajes a sus espaldas unidos por una consistencia indiscutible en lo que respecta a patrones discursivos y de ejecución, el nombre de Christopher Nolan continúa generando debates más acalorados de lo que deberían cuando se pone sobre la mesa su etiqueta de autor. Desde sus thrillers más enrevesados hasta sus aventuras cuánticas en clave bondiana, pasando por sus exploraciones de la figura del superhéroe y su aproximación al género bélico, el cineasta londinense ha hecho gala de un conjunto de características que hacen perfectamente reconocible su obra sin necesidad de leer su nombre en los títulos de crédito y sin importar en absoluto la naturaleza del proyecto. 'Oppenheimer' no sólo es la férrea confirmación del estatus autoral de un realizador que, tras un cuarto de siglo de bagaje, ya no tiene nada que demostrar. Su exploración de la figura del padre de la bomba atómica es la consagración de un estilo, amado y odiado a partes iguales a gusto del consumidor, que ha logrado convertir una película biográfica con una premisa, a priori, de lo más anodina, en uno de los espectáculos más intensos, trascendentales y arrolladores que han desembarcado en la gran pantalla durante los últimos tiempos. No cabe duda de que 'Oppenheimer' es una producción cien por cien marca de la casa Nolan, y esto comienza por ese peculiar —y habitual— contraste entre la grandilocuencia y la extraña frialdad que suele envolver su trabajo. Pero, a falta de vínculos emocionales especialmente férreos —que no inexistentes—, que muchos interpretarán como antipatía, el londinense ha dado la vuelta a la tortilla generando un magnetismo casi imposible jugando sus cartas habituales. Con su última cinta, Christopher Nolan ha conseguido un hito realmente inesperado: convertir un biopic de tres horas con hombres —y alguna que otra mujer— hablando en habitaciones en una suerte de thriller de acción en el que, paradójicamente, a pesar de su trasfondo bélico no se dispara ni una sola bala ni se corre un sólo metro en una persecución. Pero, ¿cómo se consigue esto? Para encontrar respuestas, el primer lugar al que debemos dirigir nuestra mirada es a un tratamiento formal deslumbrante que encuentra en el montaje de Jennifer Lame su mejor baza. La editora ha dotado al metraje de un ritmo implacable, aprovechando el montaje fragmentado, los juegos temporales de rigor y unos diálogos empleados como armas de repetición para moldear un relato tenso y afilado como un cuchillo. A esto debemos sumar la muy presente banda sonora de un Ludwig Göransson a medio camino entre lo escuchado en 'Tenet' y la solemne épica de cámara que compuso Hans Zimmer para 'Interstellar' y, como no podría ser de otro modo, un apartado visual que captura fotograma a fotograma el amor por la experiencia cinematográfica y el medio analógico que siempre ha prodigado el máximo responsable de 'Oppenheimer'. En mi caso, pude disfrutar de la película proyectada en 70mm y con audio DTS, y la palabra más indicada para describir la experiencia del mejor modo posible es ""mágica"". La dupla compuesta por Nolan y su DOP Hoyte Van Hoytema ha combinado una puesta en escena precisa y espectacular con una estética que combina espíritu añejo, casi nostálgico, y las posibilidades que han abierto las nuevas tecnologías. Nunca antes el fotoquímico de gran formato había lucido así tras la irrupción digital en nuestras vidas y salas de cine. Si 'Oppenheimer' es hija de su padre en forma, el fondo no iba a ser menos. De nuevo, las pautas narrativas y temáticas que han marcado la filmografía de Christopher Nolan vuelven a hacer acto de presencia, comenzando por hacer orbitar su apasionante historia en torno a un protagonista con una obsesión prácticamente autodestructiva. Pero esto no es todo, ya que los conceptos de posteridad, el tiempo y la memoria vuelven a ser esenciales en un largometraje que oscila continuamente entre el drama biográfico y el thriller político mientras apuntala sus sólidos cimientos sirviéndose de un nutrido y sólido surtido de personajes interpretado por un reparto estelar y en estado de gracia. La labor de Cillian Murphy como J. Robert Oppenheimer se postula de forma instantánea como firme candidata para arrasar en la próxima temporada de premios que comienza a tomar forma, pero el irlandés es tan sólo una pieza más —la más importante, pero una más— de un elenco en el que Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh o Matt Damon, por poner un puñado de ejemplos, muestran un nivel estratosférico. Puede que 'Oppenheimer', debido a su temática y aspiraciones, sea el trabajo menos ""popular"" de Christopher Nolan en lo que respecta a atraer al gran público, pero esto no está reñido con que, al menos por el momento, podamos catalogarla como su magnum opus. Y es que estos imprescindibles y capitales 180 minutos son la consagración de un estilo bajo la forma más improbable posible. En tiempos de dudas, cambios de paradigma, rentabilidades dudosas y predominancia de contenido, el cine sigue vivo gracias a obras como esta, y no habrá análisis financieros ni elementos extracinematográficos que lo puedan rebatir.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," OPPENHEIMER ****1/2 (180 minutes) MA
With Oppenheimer Christopher Nolan delivers what is arguably his best film yet and easily the best cinema release so far this year. It’s certainly the most respectful to a mature, thinking audience, securing Nolan’s position as one of the few A-league directors dedicated to making big-screen films for grown ups. After Dunkirk, the Dark Knight films, Interstellar and Inception, chalk this up as another hands-down triumph. Superbly directed, Oppenheimer is an engrossing historical drama from first frame to last, its three-hour running time lubricated by a sleek non-linear narrative that seamlessly shifts between three key timeframes in Oppenheimer’s life. With Cillian Murphy excellent in the leading role, the absorbing biopic tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ground-breaking physicist who was made director of the US military’s strictly secret wartime program to beat the Nazis and the Russians in creating a nuclear device. As a young scientist with an somewhat unstable disposition we see him in academia as he establishes his reputation as a pioneer in quantum physics. It’s here he meets Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a major figure in Oppenheimer’s life who would later become head of the Atomic Energy Commission where his early support for Oppenheimer morphed into something more insidious. At the heart of the portrait, of course, is the detailing of Oppenheimer’s work at the scratch-built Los Alamos facility in New Mexico, where he and his brilliant, fiery team of international scientists raced the clock to design and test the world’s first nuclear bomb. The third and most dramatically revealing phase, judiciously interspersed across the breadth of the film, gives a harrowing account of Oppenheimer’s post-war ordeal as he is hounded by Strauss and his minions as a threat to national security. The motivation for this prosecution stems ostensibly from his early links to Communism, with his wife Katherine (Emily Blunt) having once been an active participant. The real driver, though, is Oppenheimer’s advocacy for the containment of nuclear weapons, something Strauss, now a powerful conservative politician, is more than eager to shut down. As historically important as the story is, Nolan wisely keeps the film itself from becoming self-important by pulling focus on Oppenheimer’s conflicted conscience, which becomes the narrative’s major through line. Having succeeded in giving the military the weapon it needed to wreak upon an ever-defiant Japan and so bring the war to an end, Oppenheimer is beset by a guilt, even as he delivers a victorious speech to his cheering team. American flags are waving everywhere as he merrily quips about how his only regret is not getting the chance to use the device against the Nazis. Yet the moment is undercut as his head fills with visions of blinding light and scorched skin. The case in favour of bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki is made with great emphasis, the stress being on the millions of lives a mainland invasion would otherwise cost.  This is probably the most contentious part of the film, though Nolan’s clear intention is to highlight the horrific logic that strategic thinking must follow in the face of a failing adversary that refuses to yield. Nonetheless the human toll of the bombings plays havoc on Oppenheimer’s conscience. Having developed the weapon to end the war, he hoped its awesome power would end all war only to become consumed by the fear of how his creation could end the world.  Cillian Murphy puts in an outstanding performance, playing Oppenheimer as a man of science who came to question his own humanity and whose integrity was turned against him. As his chief counter, Robert Downey Jr is searing with his turn as Strauss, a complex character of shifting moral shades and fierce political instincts. After all the superhero shenanigans, it’s so good to be reminded of just how good a dramatic actor Downey can be. Others in the sterling supporting ensemble include: Matt Damon as Oppenheimer’s likeable army boss General Leslie Groves; Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh (both putting in strong work in a film that is almost all-male); Rami Malek; Casey Affleck; Kenneth Branagh; Tom Conti (as Albert Einstein, the man who laid the foundation for nuclear science); Gary Oldman (in a ripper cameo as President Harry S Truman); and Josh Hartnett as a fellow physicist. The cinematography is superlative. Shot entirely on film with IMAX cameras, Oppenheimer has a look that is both lush and intense, with Nolan’s use of black-and-white echoing Oliver Stone. One can only salute Nolan for continuing to champion the texture and vividness only achievable with film. Along with the extraordinary images and visual effects, Oppenheimer also boasts a masterful sound design, delivering its biggest aural punch during the incredibly tense early-morning bomb test.  It’s no bold assertion that Oppenheimer has got Oscar written all over it. Nolan should be clearing out some shelf space for we’ll be blessed indeed if we see a film before Christmas that tops it. FOOTNOTE: An added, though probably unintentional, bonus with the film is the detailed manner in which the process of reputation assassination is depicted. It serves as a sobering contrast to how such an attack would occur today.  Back then in the late 1940s, with Senator Joseph McCarthy’s hunt for communists in full flight, the quest to destroy a man involved a sham committee, a team of collaborators and a highly co-ordinated smear campaign running for an extended period. Today such a mission would all be done in less than a day, launched by one person making an unfounded allegation online that would then go viral before the target had any reasonable chance to respond.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Over the last few years I’ve had a bit of a messy relationship with director Christopher Nolan. I in general enjoyed his films without feeling the reverential devotion most of his fans seem to feel. Then he came out with Tenet and I was completely turned off by the entire film. Aside from the impressive visuals I couldn’t stand the pretentiousness of the character and story choices and the blaring score and unintelligible dialogue made for one of the most unpleasant movie experiences I’ve ever had. The ego that it took to put that basically arthouse piece in theaters at that point in the pandemic really offended me and lowered my estimation for the director quite a bit. All that said I go into every film with a fresh set of eyes and so I went into his new film Oppenheimer hopeful he would win me back into the fold and after seeing it I’d say I’m partly there. It’s a mixed bag but I do recommend the film and fortunately the 35mm cut I saw had understandable sound design and a score that for the most part didn’t dominate the dialogue. That said, the film is mostly effective as a historical teaching device more than it is a moving, emotional character study. It’s impressive but not something I will ever be drawn to watch again or feel connected with on a deeper level. It felt like a clinical exercise and in the end left me cold and unaffected. Like I said, the strengths of the film are the impressive attention to detail movie making capturing the 1930s setting and Los Alamos. Also the detonation scene was very well done and I kind of wish the movie had stopped there because the next 45 minutes felt repetitive and full of expository moralizing. Especially when you have such a simple concept of a right and wrong for atomic weapons scores of witnesses and dialogue begin to try our patience as viewers. What’s interesting about Oppenheimer is I wasn’t ever bored, which is saying something for a 180 minute movie. It was interesting to see what was going to happen and to learn about these events of history. I felt the same way about Nolan’s Dunkirk, but I think that movie moved me more emotionally with the simpler linear narrative and community spirit. Plus Dunkirk was a lot shorter at only 106 minutes. A big miss for me in the film was the female characters especially Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock who I have learned since watching was not portrayed accurately but even Emily Blunt’s character Kitty Oppenheimer exists only to provide motivation for Oppenheimer. Literally it is implied if he doesn’t value and love them they have no reason to live. The nudity was also unnecessary and frankly given the time and context made the female characters look silly. Most of the other cast is good, but I didn’t see a lot that wowed me including Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss (the Strauss side of the story was less compelling and I did not care for the non-linear format inserting his scenes in black and white into the Oppenheimer story. It broke up momentum for the more interesting Los Alamos storyline.) Still, I would recommend Oppenheimer. It’s impressive a studio would spend $100 million on such a methodical, serious historical epic that many mainstream filmgoers might have trouble connecting with. I left the theater feeling like I’d learned something and it was awe inspiring to watch but Nolan did not develop his characters or story in a way that moved me or left me with much other than a clinical exercise in historical moviemaking. Take that for what you will.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," While films like Interstellar and Tenet have blended science with fiction, this time Nolan focuses on real-life theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called “father of the atomic bomb”. Oppenheimer’s story is one of brilliance, fear, betrayal and ultimately regret as the American government that recruited him spat him out. Cillian Murphy plays him like a man who carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. One, labelled “fission” and filmed in colour, follows the top-secret Manhattan Project as the weapon of mass destruction set to be dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is developed. As he faces a security-clearance hearing, his tenuous past associations count against him as the US is gripped by Communist witch hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Oppenheimer mines great drama from its biographical source, the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer. While the Trinity Test – the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, conducted in the New Mexico desert – gives Nolan his literal ticking bomb, Oppenheimer is much more about the physicist’s internal struggles. He may be “the most important man that ever lived”, according to Robert Downey Jr’s character Lewis Strauss, the conniving chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, but Oppenheimer is also unstable and neurotic. Nolan’s cast is both vast and astounding. Hugely impressive are both Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, and Matt Damon as General Groves, leader of the Manhattan Project. Other stand-out performers include the Australian actor Jason Clarke, as prosecutor Roger Robb, and actor-director Benny Safdie as scientist Edward Teller. Trying to pick out a plum performance from such an illustrious ensemble, however, almost feels unfair. Knitted together by Ludwig Göransson’s tumultuous score, the film also makes full use of Hoyte van Hoytema’s IMAX-ready cinematography. The detail on camera – not just desert vistas, but worry lines on people’s faces – pulls you right into this world. There’s the odd misstep, notably one bizarrely explicit moment in the hearing sequence. But detailing the way in which the world opened Pandora’s nuclear box, Oppenheimer is more than just a historical biopic. It feels like a movie for our times.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," “There’s a price to be paid to see beyond the world we live”, and J. Robert Oppenheimer certainly spent a lot. Based on the book, American Prometheus, writer/director Christopher Nolan’s three hour sweeping saga of science and self-importance is three movies in one. The first hour is Oppenheimer’s story. Where he came from and what kind of man he was. The second hour is all about building a deadly explosive device from conception to detonation. The third hour is the effects and affects of dropping the Atomic Bomb on an unprepared world. So you can call Oppenheimer a biography, an historical thriller and a psychological drama.  Cillian Murphy is the brilliant Robert Oppenheimer. In just about every scene of this 180 minute epic, Murphy eschews and chews the scenery. He’s quiet, but methodical. Pensive yet authoritative. And sarcastically witty when needed. Especially when sparring with politician Lewis Strauss, played by an almost unrecognizable Robert Downey, Jr. As a matter of fact, part of the Oppenheimer experience is guessing which actor is playing which famous figure. Some are obvious while others will surprise. All are on point.  Oppenheimer is Nolan’s celluloid symphony on how progress and societal issues don’t always mix. Filmed in IMAX, the finished reel is 11 miles long and weighs 600 lbs. Don’t be surprised to feel the weight of this work during and after viewing. Nolan strived to succeed in making Oppenheimer as real as possible. No CGI and as historically accurate as possible.  Where Nolan misses the mark is letting the film jump around without fully identifying all the characters. It’s also not bombastic enough (pun intended) for the average movie goer. Oppenheimer is more theoretical than theatrical. In other words, there’s not a lot of action. Sparks don’t really fly till the last act.  Oppenheimer is a think piece on many levels. Those recently viewing Mission Impossible 7 or Indiana Jones may feel a let down. My husband, Ricky, fizzled after the first 90 minutes and didn’t stir until the big blast. Hence, he gives Oppenheimer one 👁 open. See this movie for the masterful filmmaking and the realization that history easily repeats itself. It’s shocking, but lacks some shock value.

If you know absolutely nothing about Oppenheimer or the Manhattan Project, Nolan’s adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s 'American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer’ may leave your head spinning (a very good 2014-2015 TNT series called ‘Manhattan’ isn’t a bad place to start) – just outlining the recognizable stars in the cast alone could fill an entire review.  But keeping track of every single character isn’t necessary to grasp Nolan’s vision of a man inspired by Quantum mechanics and a burning desire to outrace the Nazis persecuting his fellow Jews, yet who forged ahead with atomic bomb development after Hitler’s death, even participating in choosing Japanese targets, then reversed his stance on moral grounds after the war (something else which rankled Strauss, not to mention Harry S. Truman (Gary Oldman)).
“Oppenheimer” is a movie of a million moving pieces, with Nolan revisiting seminal moments, turning them around to inspect them from every angle.  The physicist trailed by whispers of communism because of his support of Spanish loyalists (who were funded via the Communist Party) and his passionate affair with known communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), is first seen stating his Bhagavad Gita mantra, ‘Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,’ when she demands he translate something from Sanskrit while she straddles him, both naked.  And *that* image will be repeated when during his security hearing, Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), conjures it as he testifies about the relationship.  Most famously he uttered the words during the Trinity test, one rumored to have been named in reference to Jean, when the atomic bomb went off, he watching from a wooden box in the desert, his eyes shielded by goggles.  A chance meeting between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) grows in Strauss’s memory as a plot against him, only to be revealed as cautionary words to the ‘father of the atomic bomb.’  And the Cambridge head tutor Patrick Blackett (James D'Arcy), whom a young Oppenheimer tried to poison with an apple, returns years later to denounce him in an opinion piece.
The density of politics, science, friendships and betrayals are treated like their own chain reaction, like the one we learn Los Alamos scientist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) believed might never stop, igniting earth’s atmosphere and destroying the world.  This revelation leads to one of many pointed exchanges between Oppenheimer and Groves.  Murphy, with his large blue eyes, intense cheekbones and skeletal frame, embodies Oppenheimer’s contradictions, his demeanor alternating between restrained amusement of those around him and anxiety-stricken introspection.  Damon parades with military bark yet interacts with the (mostly) liberal scientists with something approaching gruff affection.  He is this movie’s equivalent of comic relief.  It is also a great pleasure to see Robert Downey Jr. released from that iron suit, giving a complex performance as a man with great ambition but deep insecurities.  Josh Hartnett is the easy going Berkeley scientist Ernest Lawrence who recreates the German’s atom splitting breakthrough and is continually frustrated by the liberal politics he believes stand in Oppenheimer’s way.  You’ll see Oscar winner Rami Malek flash by for a moment, only to reappear later to testify against Strauss during his senate cabinet hearing.  Other notable contributing players include Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr, Jason Clarke (whose Roger Robb gets a formidable foe in Emily Blunt’s Kitty during that kangaroo court hearing), Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich and Casey Affleck.  Olivia Thirlby is Los Alamos scientist Lili Hornig, who led an internal movement to stop the actual use of the bomb.  And while Nolan chose not to depict the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he does depict Oppenheimer imagining its effect on a woman in the crowd he addresses after the first has been dropped, our skin crawling as they cheer their success.
The film has been given a high contrast look by director of photography Hoyte Van Hoytema, who partially shot the film with IMAX cameras.  Editor Jennifer Lame doesn’t so much connect the dots as leave them in a scattered, yet discernible pattern.  Production designer Ruth De Jong recreated Los Alamos close to its original setting, determined to get the mountainous horizon right.  Ludwig Göransson’s score is full of wonder and grandeur and portent, tying everything together.  Nolan, who has frequently been criticized for his inaudible sound mixes, here gives us clarity with dashes of surrealism, the Trinity Test accompanied only by Oppenheimer’s breathing, booming waves rolling over us in the moments after.
Even at three hours, “Oppenheimer” cannot encompass all the aspects of this man’s life, some, like his marriage and children, given short shrift.   But Nolan has given us a monumental piece of work about a complex historical character and done it with such dazzling style it evokes his very essence.

"Jul 20, 2023"," Blockbuster director Christopher Nolan goes bigger in style and spectacle than ever before with Oppenheimer—and what’s bigger than the A-Bomb? Luke Buckmaster feels there’s something missing in the biopic’s fragmented moral message. Christopher Nolan’s film about the “father of the atomic bomb,” J. Robert Oppenheimer, is intensely scattered and intentionally disorderly, bending over backwards to create a feeling of uncontrollable escalation. The thrust of the drama heads in one direction—to the invention and deployment of the first nuclear weapons—but its various bits and pieces fly about like stirred up chemical compounds, jumping timelines and even colour schemes, with the nervy chutzpah of an Oliver Stone movie. There isn’t much to hold onto in the whirlwind of the first act, other than Cillian Murphy’s leading performance: a projection of disquieting intelligence that coyly allows for inferences of humanity, should you wish to observe them. The excitement Nolan builds is palpable, but the exhiliration is stomach-sinking. We can’t help but react to the swelling score, the claps of thunder, the jagged cuts, the crescendoing energy. We’re swept along by the currents of a story that resulted in almost unthinkable (except we know it happened) and near unimaginable (ditto) devastation. The great François Truffaut famously said “there’s no such thing as an anti-war film,” arguing you can’t recreate war on screen without in some way celebrating it. Even—perhaps especially—as spectacle. I wonder if some of the same logic applies here. It’d be preposterous to say Nolan has made a pro-bomb movie, but there were lots of ways to contextualise this story, lots of ways to tell it. It didn’t need to be so juiced up. All the sound and fury means there’s no cool hand guiding the messaging. Lust for big visions and stylistic verve helps explain Nolan’s biggest mistake: not getting his moral framing right. I expected the film to make a point that everybody’s actions were sickening—including of course Oppenheimer’s. It kind of gets there, but the presence of a more traditional villain, carved from the machinations of American politics—Robert Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss, a bureaucrat serving in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission—wildly changes its emphasis. It’s laughable to suggest Oppenheimer and Strauss’ moral crimes are comparable, but Nolan goes further than that: emphasising the latter’s chicanery in highlighter pen while the protagonist receives the soft glows of nuance. The opening scenes are fragmentary, the cuts sharp. Nolan—who is always interesting visually—is pulled as if by magnet to images illustrating energy: water, fire, compounds. You know the film can’t stay scattered like this. If there’s a centre of gravity, it’s Murphy, with his sunken cheeks and malnourished face. I can’t decide if he looks more like a genius scientist or a sad clown. First act pivots include Oppenheimer beginning to teach American university students, meeting contemporaries such as Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and having a romantic relationship with the highly intelligent but troubled communist Jean Tatlock (an impressively sad-eyed Florence Pugh). This aspect of the film works very well: it’s a dramatically fraught and interesting relationship, casting a shadow over their lives. They have a prickly kind of passion: you feel both closeness and distance between them, the gaps they’ll never close. And you believe every second of it. Even later scenes that are tinted with surreal imagery, illustrating how old lovers haunt each other: the passion never ending, the flame always flickering. From the start Nolan jumps around in time, often leaping forwards to characters looking back (via dialogue), including Oppenheimer being grilled at a kangaroo court hearing. The film clicks into higher gear upon the arrival of Matt Damon’s Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project, who approaches Oppenheimer and recruits him as the leader of its secret weapons laboratory. Many scenes are built around conversations reiterating Oppenheimer’s intelligence; we get it, we get it. Much is also made of his interest in left-leaning politics, but surprisingly little is said about this—we don’t come away with a clear impression of where he sits ideologically. Maybe he didn’t know himself. But it seems certain he was a person who searched for moral and spiritual purpose. The film could’ve been richer if the director stopped slicing up his drama and configured well-developed moral and intellectual positions. What’s he really saying about nuclear weapons and catastrophic arms races, beyond an inevitably cautionary message—that old one about the genie and the bottle? Was proliferation a historical inevitability? What does Nolan think about the concept of mutually assured destruction (one of the subjects satirised in Kubrick’s great, and still relevant, Dr Strangelove)? This film can’t and doesn’t have to answer every question you throw at it. But if any film should have carefully defined messaging, it’s this one. The aforementioned topics are touched on but you can tell Nolan is mostly interested is spectacle and narrative arrangement. Blockbuster directors get consumed by the spirit of one-upmanship…and what’s bigger than the A-bomb? Nolan does stage scenes showing Oppenheimer dabbling in leftist circles, fraternising with communists, turning his classrooms into progressive hothouses. But these scenes are clipped and the director keeps whooshing away, scattering the pieces, zhuzhing up the structure. He’s like a magician whose brilliance at sleight of hand has made him forgot the simple pleasures of patter, stretching things out, letting moments breathe. When I think about Inception, Nolan’s magnum opus, I think about sets, I think about staging, I think about individual scenes, I think about clever interplay between digital and physical assets. When I think about Oppenheimer, I think in fragments. I think about a film made in the edit. Rhythmically it means business; its morals and intellect are separate matters.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Ever since redefining the realist capabilities of superhero films, Christopher Nolan has been negotiating the separation between mainstream audience accessibility and his own personal aesthetic. Pivoting from developing a Howard Hughes biopic – unfortunately coming hot off the heels of Martin Scorsese’s monumental “The Aviator” (Marty’s most underrated, in this writer’s mind) – the maestro of time and space re-envisioned Frank Miller’s “Batman: Year One” through the lens of a gritty street film junkie; beginning with heavy John Huston influence, following a weary but privileged American on an adventure to another land, and ending as a meeting point between a Sidney Lumet character piece and Michael Mann epic. “The Dark Knight” could very well be described as “Heat” by way of “Serpico.” Despite its radical departure from typical genre trappings – particularly in regards to the tragic ending – Nolan found audience champions like never before. His next four films would net nearly $4 billion at the box office, yet, despite the near unanimous acclaim (pre-”The Dark Knight Rises” dividing audiences), the most successful filmmaker of the century still found himself without an Oscar nomination for Best Director under his belt (his most egregious snub was the same cursed year Tom Hooper stole David Fincher’s statue). Continuing this odd, almost godly cultural narrative, “Dunkirk” – effectively an experimental art film – finally found him Academy success. The film’s innovative montage is more Sergei Eisenstein or Abel Gance than it is a war film a la Steven Spielberg or Oliver Stone. And so we come to the concept of a paradox, which has come to define Nolan’s career as an artist; a superhero savior who choses to be the city’s villain; a magician who obsesses over a single trick so much he turns it into science experiment; a dream thief who wants to live in the waking world because he turned his wife’s into a nightmare. Even through dialog, Nolan cannot escape his fixation on paradoxes and parallelisms; “Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here.” With “Oppenheimer,” he’s engineered a historical parallax. Effect before cause is “Tenet’s” very coda (not a simple one). “Oppenheimer” looms over the same enigma. “They won’t fear it, until they understand it, and they won’t understand it, until they’ve used it.” This is the Oppenheimer quote most everyone knows and Nolan wisely realizes not even a three hour film can fully dive into its implications. As with “Tenet,” Nolan hones in on the idea that repeat viewings should only enrich the greatest of films. Via his parallax structure, he uses point-of-view film grammar as both a portent of doom and narrative withholding device. Certain scenes (unless one is already educated on the historical details) only fully come into focus once we see them from a second perspective, making “Oppenheimer” not unlike “The Prestige” as a cross-cutting balancing act of when to play the cards, versus patiently waiting for the opportune time to hide them up a sleeve. It’s also a parallel film to “Dunkirk;” showing the Japanese side of World War II as opposed to the European; exploring how the war was won behind closed doors (and in the middle of nowhere), while thousands more physically risked and lost their lives on beaches and battlefields across the ocean. “Dunkirk” only referred to Nazis as “The Enemy,” and “Oppenheimer” makes a hauntingly similar statement about the unknowable. The former film is essentially isolated in one, open space, location, Dunkirk itself; “Oppenheimer” is a chamber piece that propels itself through time and space. Once again circling back to paradoxes, Nolan’s film is grandiose despite its often opaque interiority and dialog driven narrative. It’s tremendous in scope yet intimate in perspective. There is a chasm of purposeful confusion between the two; Murphy’s performance a cipher of poetic self-catastophe. Right and reason combat each other like the heart and mind. We feel what Oppenheimer feels though we never come close to being capable of understanding how he thinks. “Oppenheimer’s” marketing campaign almost reads as a countdown to the end of the world, one extremely reminiscent of the Swan Station from “Lost’s” Dharma Initiative, a clear fictional expansion of what started at Los Alamos. “That button has to be pushed” John Locke tells the audience, a self-proclaimed “Man of Faith” (named after a seminal philosopher) maintains. The Doctor, the “Man of Science” disagrees. Parallax and paradox. They might die if they don’t push the button and they have no idea what the hell happens every time they do. “Inception” and “Interstellar,” are undeniably meta-statements on the consequences of living inside one’s imagination at the cost of family. “Tenet” and “Inception” are both easily read as allegories to the filmmaking process (Cobb and Neil both clear Nolan doppelgängers). “The Prestige” parallels two magicians with rival perspectives on how to approach the concept of showmanship. Do you push the button that will sell your artistic soul to sell tickets, or do you dedicate yourself so obsessively to authentic craft that you lose everything else in the process? “Oppenheimer” touches upon all of these questions. Sadly, its approach to family and its female characters only reinforces prior criticisms of Nolan’s screenwriting side. He does attempt to comment on the “sin,” in a key climactic scene, though, in the end, it’s not quite enough. However, part of the entire point is how perceived importance doesn’t excuse immoral action, perhaps even when the future of the world is at stake. “Man’s reach exceeds his imagination.” It’s doubtful Nolan fully blames himself for the superhero crisis Hollywood is facing but that doesn’t mean he wasn’t an accidental prophet of the creative apocalypse. After all, he simply sees the effect before the cause. He made a film about Tesla, well before the world cared about Tesla, or had even heard the name Elon Musk (“See I’m not a monster. I’m just ahead of the curve.”) “Oppenheimer” can very much be read as a point of no return for the obsessive, visionary archetype, but it’s far more than that; a cautionary tale and character study as only this movie magician could make.

"Jul 20, 2023"," It’s a ‘mic-drop’ moment in Christopher Nolan’s latest film – Oppenheimer. When these words are chillingly stated, flowing in a haunting sea of atomic explosions, it’s the visceral accumulation on the power of the human mind and what it is capable of. In Nolan’s Promethean epic, it’s the constant wrestling between beauty and destruction.  Based on the book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the power of belief has always been an instrumental tool in Nolan’s work, characters embarking on a psychological crusade/mission to achieve the impossible. In Batman Begins, it was Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) transforming himself from a man into an incorruptible symbol – an ideal. In TENET (an indirect foretelling on the path towards Oppenheimer), The Protagonist (John David Washington) fights for the future. But perhaps, The Prestige (Nolan’s best film) is its closest identifier – a journey between two men absorbed in an endless egotistical battle of moral choices that sacrifices their friendship until the ultimate price is paid. If anything, Nolan always dares to ask the question: what is the accountability of such belief? It comes as no surprise that Nolan has reached the apex of such an ideology with Oppenheimer. Known as the father of the atomic bomb, the science in its creation – a detonation that led to the aerial bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – changed the world. “A new world,” as the film claims, and it’s Nolan’s most powerful work to date.  It would be a mistake to think of this as a ‘by the numbers’ biopic on the legacy of Robert J. Oppenheimer with Cillian Murphy in the titular role, chronicling from his breakthrough with quantum mechanics to the detonation of the bomb. In classic Nolan fashion, nothing is ever done by half-measures! Converging between Fission (colour) and Fusion (black and white), the story embarks on a narrative of perspectives. Colour is reserved for Oppenheimer, while black and white is from the viewpoint of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). This is Nolan in his element. Capturing the “the good, the bad and the ugly” with Oppenheimer’s motivations allows the script (which he wrote) to take complex agendas of wonder and brilliance. Still, it leaves the open and fearful realisation of ‘how much is too much power when white people (because let’s be honest) operate in their own siloed worlds’, and empathy is reduced to a footnote? There’s nothing more chilling than hearing a character list out Japanese bombing locations and argue about taking Kyoto off the map because he honeymooned with his wife there. This coldness generates the necessary tension throughout, igniting, like the atom bomb itself, the evils of capitalism. And it culminates into the fiery centrepiece – the Trinity Test detonation. The continued technical advocacy for the IMAX format shines through with its 70mm print. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s cinematography once again captures the scale of an incredible experience. You feel as if Terrence Malick’s Tree of Life was a visual inspiration. Whenever Oppenheimer explains the theory behind the science, the screen cuts to an intense collision of atoms (an image that haunts him throughout the film). The sound design alongside Ludwig Göransson’s score is impeccable. And for a three-hour film with dense scientific dialogue, it doesn’t feel its weight thanks to Jennifer Lame’s sharp editing. With his piercing blue eyes, Murphy delivers an outstanding performance as the morally tortured American scientist. As a frequent collaborator with Nolan, the reward of his first leading role deserves recognition for playing all the characteristics of Oppenheimer’s troubled and conflicted psyche. It’s highpoint – a victory speech surrounded by emotional dissonance as crowds celebrate the end of the war. As for Robert Downey Jr., it’s no wonder he considers this his best career role. As Strauss, it’s the art of manipulation to discredit Oppenheimer’s credibility. Whilst the female characters could always be better under Nolan’s filmography, Emily Blunt’s steely performance as Kitty Oppenheimer marks a steady improvement. Operating at the peak of his powers, Oppenheimer is Nolan’s crowning achievement as a filmmaker, capturing the moral existentialism of the human condition and the terrifying imaginings of the arrogance of power—one of the best of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Imperceptible light and matter swirl in intricate harmony below the surface of everything we perceive. The atomic building blocks of photons, protons, neutrons, electrons and more, bound up in the ghost-like webs that connect them, are the source code of all creation.  But just as the rogue Titan trickster Prometheus stole fire from the cantankerous Olympians and bestowed it upon humans, who in turn used it to illuminate and extinguish lives, these elemental sparks can be torn apart, smashed together and then used to set the world alight. Creation and destruction are inextricably bound in an infinite loop by this proclamation from the Hindu deity Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, predating the Greek myth. It is these words, and Krishna’s rejoinder to mortal soldier Arjuna: ‘I am become Death, destroyer of worlds,’ that infamously sprang from the lips of Dr Julius Robert ‘father of the bomb’ Oppenheimer, a student of the ancient scripture in its original Sanskrit, as he stood in the dirt of Jornada del Muerto (Dead Man’s Journey, talk about nominative determinism from the possibly prophetic Spanish conquistadors) just before dawn on July 16, 1945, while watching the sky burn. Who, exactly, harnesses the destructive power of godhood has been drastically altered by these Promethean hands. Oppenheimer’s Manhattan Project team was worried that the ‘Fat Man’ bomb – set to raze Nagasaki three days after the simpler, smaller ‘Little Boy’ would annihilate Hiroshima – may not work, so they planned the fateful ‘Trinity’ test (a hat trick of creation/ death stories for the win) in the isolated deserts of New Mexico. Adapting Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s biography American Prometheus, Nolan deploys almost Aaron Sorkin-like rapid-fire dialogue to dash out the details of Oppenheimer’s eventful life in a film built upon the god particle creative paradox of what is seen and unseen. The contradictions abound, so it’s wise Nolan tapped Irish actor of cut-glass features Cillian Murphy as the haunted (to a point) theoretical physicist. A gifted actor with an innate understanding of restraint not always available to the Hollywood pantheon, he can hold multitudes in the almost indiscernible flicker of his face (admittedly easier to spot on Melbourne’s ginormous IMAX screen). It intriguingly suggests that Oppenheimer is more tortured by the possibilities of the unseen world as a lonely student in Europe, grappling with the world’s minuscule but momentous mechanics, than in his elder days interrogated as a possible Communist traitor by shadowy extra-judicial forces led by a steely-eyed Jason Clarke as Roger Robb.  A real-life poisoning attempt on his demanding tutor with an apple is both very biblical and under-explored here, but Oppenheimer’s inner doubt and despair are caught in rain-lashed flashes, reflected in murky puddles that intertwine with ethereal sub-atomic lighting strikes that appear to crackle out of the darkness and into the audience. Hoyte Van Hoytema’s luminous cinematography casts a hellfire glare on the film’s haunted grey pallor. Could it be that Oppenheimer had become so adept at compartmentalising the impossible decision he and his Manhattan Project team faced when racing the Nazis to weaponise Berlin’s discovery of fission?  It’s one of the film’s odd twitches that sometimes character is swept overboard by slavish devotion to complicated history, which is a shame given the mighty ensemble assembled here. Both Florence Pugh, as card-carrying Communist party member and psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, who had an affair with Oppenheimer, and Emily Blunt as his biologist wife Katherine ‘Kitty’, are sorely underutilised. I really wish filmmakers like Nolan could figure out a way to tell women’s stories in such a way that they step out of the limitations of these oppressive eras without reducing them to glibly depicted alcoholism and depression. Matt Damon shines as gruff Army general Leslie Groves, tasked with overseeing Oppenheimer and his wayward Manhattan Project colleagues, most of whom blend into the background, barring Josh Hartnett by the sheer dint of his screen charisma, too cruelly stalled by Pearl Harbour flopping (and yes, his presence here feels multiversal).  Tom Conti is a likeable Albert Einstein, sidestepping Oppenheimer’s date with dark destiny. Robert Downey Jr puts in his best work in years as Lewis Strauss, the former chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission whose nomination to the Senate by President Eisenhower becomes entangled with the question of Oppenheimer’s loyalty.  Solo star Alden Ehrenreich has a fun, if low-key, turn as his Sorkin-like political aide in these black-and-white sequences that speak to how inefficient a binary is when prosecuting the case for actions being good or evil in these circumstances. Though Nolan’s at times heavy-handed screenplay is at great pains to underline that Hitler had already fallen and Japan was almost certainly set for defeat when President Truman ordered the deployment of the twin bombs. Speaking of which, the Trinity test sequence is spectacularly staged by visual effects supervisor Andrew Jackson, accompanied by special effects whizz Scott Fisher, opting for practical pyrotechnics over CGI as much as possible. The countdown is real edge-of-your-seat stuff, as is the blast itself, though the sound design here fizzles a little.  Which is odd, given Willie D. Burton’s work is excellent for the most part, and a vast improvement on Tenet’s inaudibility. Ludwig Göransson’s majestically menacing score helps sweep you into the maelstrom. This fracture in history, forever tilting the world on its axis, will undoubtedly continue to be debated through the ages. Nolan may be a little too captured by the immensity of it all to fully deliver on the humanity of this horror, though no doubt a world of psychologist bills awaits his decision to cast his daughter Flora, who popped up in Interstellar, as the only overt radiation burns victim depicted in a nightmarish fusion of the Trinity celebration and the only-implied monstrous reality on the ground in Japan.  It’s an understandable decision, not to directly depict the obliteration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But as wise a choice as this probably is, you can’t help but feel it’s also emblematic of some of the cop-outs from sitting in consequence at play here. Murphy really isn’t allowed much time to show us the man behind the name, though it’s no fault of his impeccable performance. A remarkable film, despite its foibles, like those neutrons, protons and electrons manhandled by (in)humanity, what is not here is as important as what is. Perhaps there’s no wrangling with this moment that can fully satisfy. Nolan, after all, is not god any more than Oppenheimer was.  Nolan’s latest epic is a work of self-professed importance that manages to be simultaneously over-stuffed and under-done, yet also, in several stretches of its never dull three-hour runtime, approaches the imperceptible sublime.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," “Oppenheimer” works better in pieces than it does as a whole. It’s an oddly imbalanced film. There are moments in writer-director Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the “father of the atomic bomb,” that are so unbelievable they deserve to be laughed off the screen. There are also scenes and performances that rank among the best in the director’s canon. It’s a pleasure to see Robert Downey Jr., as Oppenheimer’s antagonist Admiral Lewis Strauss, sink his teeth into a meaty role that warrants Oscar consideration. I’ve never been neutral when it comes to Nolan: I either love or hate his movies. There was no middle ground until this film, which left me conflicted in ways I need more time to interrogate. What I can say for sure is that “Oppenheimer” far too often feels like a three-hour Wikipedia entry than a compelling movie. In his fifth collaboration with Nolan, Cillian Murphy plays the titular physicist who at one point is described as both a womanizer and a genius. We see Oppenheimer teaching at Berkeley, working with the scientists who will help him build the Manhattan Project’s atomic bomb in Los Alamos, N.M., and interacting with his wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Murphy effectively conveys his character’s scientific curiosity, but Nolan’s screenplay makes him an enigma whose inner life is expressed by gimmicky cuts to scenes of outer space rather than evidence of human emotions. In telling Oppenheimer’s dense, detail-filled story, Nolan hops back and forth in time, changing aspect ratios and splitting the film between black-and-white and color sequences. It’s extraneous showboating, but Hoyte van Hoytema’s Oscar-worthy cinematography makes it worthwhile. “Oppenheimer” is the best-looking movie of Nolan’s career. Much has been made about this film’s R rating, Nolan’s first since his 2002 remake of “Insomnia.” One should always be wary when a film’s rating becomes an attempted selling point because it means that there’s probably little else to offer. “Oppenheimer” has a few F-words and provides a valid reason as to why Nolan has avoided shooting sex scenes in prior films, and why he should avoid shooting them in the future. They are unintentionally hilarious and far from erotic. It’s a rather soft R. Additionally, the PR machine hasn’t done the film any favors by promoting Nolan’s claim that people were leaving early screenings of the movie “absolutely devastated.” Long before I walked into the theater, I read that the re-creation of Trinity (the code name used for testing the atomic bomb on July 16, 1945) would be such an immersive experience that I’d be, forgive the expression, blown away by it. Knowing Nolan’s notoriously muddled sound mixes, I didn’t believe that. Neither should you. Legend has it that, after witnessing Trinity, Oppenheimer quoted the Bhagavad Gita: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” In this movie, he actually says that line while having sex with Jean; at my screening, the audience laughed. Far more interesting, at least for a while, is the film’s examination of the rift between scientists who know the dangers of the weapons they create and the politicians who want to exploit them. This conflict fascinates Nolan, and the movie springs to life as it shows scientists wrestling with their curiosity while fearing what might happen should they proceed further. The latter half of “Oppenheimer” deals with what happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed. Strauss, the Commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission, is up for a Cabinet post. In a congressional meeting, he is asked about his prior association with Oppenheimer, who had in the past attended Communist meetings with his brother, Jean, and Kitty. Oppenheimer becomes a vocal proponent for control of atomic weapons, but his warnings are a thorn in the side of the US government; and because as a popular and beloved figure he can sway public opinion, he must be discredited. What follows is an interminable series of scenes set in courtrooms and at congressional hearings. Only Downey’s kinetic, sardonic performance keeps things from becoming unbearably dull. As in those epic historical films of yesteryear, actors show up in extended cameos. Leaving an impression are Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, who hires Oppenheimer to preside over Los Alamos, the desert town created for scientists working on the bomb, and Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Tom Conti is also memorable as Albert Einstein, whose relationship with Oppenheimer could have used more screen time. “Oppenheimer” wastes the considerable talents of Pugh as the physicist’s mistress. She and Blunt have severely underwritten roles, but Pugh bears the brunt of Nolan’s disinterest in writing complex female characters. This isn’t new on Nolan’s part. Additionally, his penchant for drowning out necessary dialogue becomes intolerable whenever he uses Ludwig Göransson’s grating score. At one point, Kitty asks her husband if he thinks being tarred and feathered by the government commission prosecuting him will result in the public forgiveness he seeks to assuage his guilt over the atomic bomb. I wish “Oppenheimer” provided an answer. It might have humanized its subject.",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," Some filmmakers have the soul of a dramatist. Christopher Nolan has the soul of a theoretical physicist. Nolan has wrangled his way into the position of Hollywood's not-so-mad scientist, filling chalkboards with elaborate designs and manifesting them into idiosyncratic artworks that polarize audiences. Every film venture—and certainly every historical film—is, in a sense, a problem to be solved, making Nolan suitable (in some ways uniquely so) to will into being Oppenheimer, his epic reconstruction and deconstruction of the Manhattan Project and the man who organized it. With apparent empathy, Nolan correctly frames J. Robert Oppenheimer as a revolutionary striding beyond the cutting edge of his field. We watch Nolan's Oppenheimer ponder a Picasso, read ""The Waste Land,"" listen to The Rite of Spring, talk of Freud and Marx as he pursues his ""radical new approach to physics,"" while the director applies his own unconventional approach to—in both senses of the phrase—solving a problem like his protagonist. That unconventional approach doesn't always ignite, but if nothing else, Oppenheimer represents a monumental achievement of verisimilitude. The film's ""you are there"" quality begins with the source material (Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, adapted by Nolan himself) and extends to a staggeringly well-appointed ensemble of acting talent (led by Cillian Murphy in the title role), supported by perfection of production design (Ruth De Jong), art direction (Samantha Englender and Anthony D. Parrillo), and costuming (Ellen Mirojnick). Nolan employs a nonlinear narrative approach that primarily dramatizes Oppenheimer's path to the historic Trinity test of the first atomic bomb and its dramatic counterpoint: the 1954 closed-door hearing that resulted in Oppenheimer losing his national security clearance. As wonky as all this gets in its devilish details, Nolan mostly keeps his lines taut as he pulls the proceedings along for 180 minutes. For a story predicated on scientific advancement, Oppenheimer shows surprisingly little interest in getting into those weeds. Nolan proves more interested in the byzantine organization and politics of the Manhattan Project and, ultimately, concerns himself with conscience far more than science. That's a sensible approach when dealing with arguably the most psychologically intense of historical protagonists, the man who infamously told Harry Truman, ""Mr. President, I feel I have blood on my hands"" (Gary Oldman conjures up Truman for the pithy Oval Office encounter). The film's emotional climax comes as Oppenheimer stands before bleachers of flag-waving enthusiasts as he awaits word of his creation's terrible destruction, his whole world coming unglued in real time and in public. Nolan achieves his best effects by yanking us out of his precise, literal storytelling and into unnerving expressionism, whether it be a solid object suddenly shuddering behind Oppenheimer's head or blown-out flashes evocative of atomic explosions. Oppenheimer's head is a haunting place to be, and Murphy proves an ideal choice to invite us in. Murphy's alien eyes and gaunt frame have always set him apart from his movie-star peers, and while they work to great effect here, it's Murphy's innate ability to project brooding intellect and raw, wounded feeling that keep us watching, fascinated by Oppenheimer's brilliance, his arrogant capacity to be his own worst enemy, and ultimately his guilt-wracked devastation at opening the scariest Pandora's Box science has yet known. That we stand on the precipice of a new contender for that prize in the as-yet-unknown consequences of A.I. development handily provides Oppenheimer with timely resonance, as does the frightening notion that one existential threat (say, genocidal fascism) demands another (mutually assured destruction). The political skullduggery likewise demonstrates that the more things change, the more they stay the same. This half of the story largely belongs to Robert Downey Jr., who cannily plays the villain of the piece (Lewis Strauss of the Atomic Energy Commission) close to the vest, slowly revealing him to be a manipulator as bold as he is insecure in his seductions and Red-Scare demonizations. The screenplay fills in enough of Oppenheimer's personal life to address his moral failings, the mystery of his personal contradictions, the self-justifications and dark nights of the soul of the ""great man"" who cannot afford self-doubt while in the process of achieving greatness (a fiercely wound Emily Blunt—as Oppenheimer's second wife Katherine—and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's whip-smart but emotionally disregulated paramour Jean Tatlock expertly embody the foils revealing the ground-level stakes of Oppenheimer's personal life). Nolan's narrative style can be choppy, and Oppenheimer at times plays out an entire scene in five seconds. Those moments lay bare how the writer-director can sometimes be too efficient for his own good (on the other hand, he could have trimmed a bit of redundancy out of the film's last act, as the hearings come to a head), while the poetic imagery that bookends the film's Promethean fire with shots of rain drops in a puddle or pond, rippling out like consequential shock waves—as well as some of the clunkier dialogue (Strauss wondering aloud, ""How could this man who saw so much be so blind?"")—will understandably strike some as trite.  Nolan continues to attract an astonishing array of talent in front of and behind the camera, dedicatedly shooting on 65mm film (including with IMAX cameras) long after the industry as a whole succumbed to the relative cheapness and flexibility of digital. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema gets to cast worrying depths of shadow in both color and black and white, which Nolan employs along with changing hairstyles to acclimate us to when we are on the timeline, and to shift perspective from Oppenheimer's point of view to an objective one. The New Mexico landscapes of Oppenheimer's beloved Los Alamos add to the sense of scale, trumped only by the height and mechanics of the bomb test. Nolan's soundscapes, mumbly Method acting mixed with portentous music (here the stormy sound waves of Ludwig Göransson), can make for a muddy mix, but trust your ears to adjust in time.  Despite his film having prestige written all over it, Nolan the theoretical cineaste has rewritten the rules of the prestige picture, and it remains to be seen if Nolan's knotty refusal to cough up a straightforward classical biopic will be his ticket to Oscar glory. More importantly to an industry in peril, Oppenheimer dares to imply with its summer release date that it's something of an intellectual blockbuster, a see-it-on-the-big-screen draw that's also as uncommercial as can be for those who've never heard of Letterboxd. But if Oppenheimer may be easier to admire than to love, that's alright. Faced with no simple task, Nolan devours a true story of great import, of the best and worst humanity can achieve, of nature and runaway human nature, of genius and small-mindedness. [NOTE: Only 30 screens in the world—and just 19 in the U.S.—are screening Oppenheimer in Nolan'd preferred format: 70mm IMAX, projected from 11-mile long film prints. This critic's local screening was on one of those giant screens, at the AMC Metreon in San Francisco. It's worth the effort to seek out these special presentations, the ultimate payoff of Nolan's ""see it on a big screen"" agenda.]",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," Writer/director Christopher Nolan loves to manipulate time in his movies, from the told-in-reverse Memento to the dream state in Inception to the time inversion in Tenet. Most of his films require a second or even third viewing to start to grasp exactly what he’s trying to say, much less the subtle nuances hidden within the complex storytelling. His latest trick/film, Oppenheimer, does plenty of hopping back and forth in time, but in the more conventional guise of a biopic. It’s a deep, three-hour dive into the complicated life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), considered to be the father of the atomic bomb. Over three hours, the audience is shown different periods of his life, including as a promising student, as a professor at Caltech, as the leader of the scientific team creating the atomic bomb in New Mexico, and his post-war life in which he would face scrutiny over his political beliefs and more. The film is packed to the gills with characters, so densely that it’s nearly impossible to keep track of everyone and their relationships. Among the most important ones are Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), with whom he has a strained relationship; Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who leads the military component of the bomb project; and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), a colleague of Oppenheimer who led the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. This is Nolan’s first biopic, but he’s still true to his inimitable style, flitting around to the different eras of Oppenheimer’s life so often and so quickly that it takes a good hour to understand exactly when and where specific scenes are taking place. As with his previous films, he doesn’t bother to hold the audience’s hands, instead throwing character after character at them with abandon. And despite the fact that this leads to confusion over even the names of certain people, it’s done in such a manner that the overall tone of the film is what matters most. In another filmmaker’s hands, the story might come off as dry and stodgy, but the pace with which the film is edited, as well as the propulsive score from Ludwig Göransson, gives it the feel of a thriller for much of its running time. The film is reminiscent of Oliver Stone’s JFK, with its re-evaluation of a historical moment, scenes involving government hearings, segments of the film being in black-and-white, and even a cameo by Gary Oldman as a very notable person. The film does flag a bit in its final hour as it tackles Oppenheimer contemplating what he has wrought on the world, as well as his legacy. And despite Nolan using IMAX cameras to supposedly make the film a visual extravaganza, it’s unclear what purpose that served, as there are relatively few moments that pop, even the movie's signature moment (Full disclosure: The screening I attended was in 70 mm, not IMAX). Murphy has more often than not played supporting characters in his career, but he commands every second he’s on screen here. He employs a unique not-quite monotone and straightforward delivery that keeps him riveting throughout. There are too many other actors to properly laud them all, but Damon, Downey, and Florence Pugh in a small-but-essential role are among the other standouts. Oppenheimer is grand in scale, with an immense number of characters and storylines, but Nolan directs the film in such a way that it feels manageable as a viewer. The implications of the story are dire, but the filmgoing experience watching it transpire is anything but. A national pickleball franchise is poised to serve up its first Dallas facility this summer. Called Picklr, it’ll open in McKinney at 2975 Craig Dr., taking over a former Bed Bath and Beyond store.  The facility will open in early June, according to a release. It’s part of a national expansion plan for the Picklr franchise, which is headquartered in Kaysville, Utah and has more than 250 facilities across multiple states.  Picklr has at least seven facilities planned in Texas; in March, the company announced plans to open a venue in Fort Worth’s White Settlement at the end of May. A company representative confirmed that the Fort Worth venue is still slated to open in May but declined to share where the other locations are going.  The new venue will be McKinney’s first facility exclusively dedicated to pickleball, although the city has a handful of tennis courts that can also be used for pickleball. The sport has recently exploded in popularity across North Texas and the county, but most of the new pickleball facilities storming the area have been concentrated in Dallas, Frisco, and Plano.  The McKinney venue will feature 10 indoor courts built with a 30-by-60-foot playing area, which is the professional standard for pickleball. The space will allow for league play, tournaments, and open play, and it’s meant to be welcoming to both pro and amateur players.  “There is no one bigger or better than The Picklr when it comes to indoor pickleball clubs, and we are thrilled to bring a first-class indoor pickleball facility to McKinney,” says Jeremy Scott, partner in Dallas Picklr Group. “The Picklr McKinney location has been designed with players in mind. Every detail in our club, from the black walls, lighting, court surface, fencing, sound clouds for noise reduction, lockers, showers, and lounge areas, has been scrutinized and implemented with the playing experience as our number one priority. This means that players in the club will have the best playing environment, the best visibility, and the best courts any of us have ever experienced.”",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," There's a kind of grandiose scale to 'Oppenheimer' that is often missing from movies that don't include some variation of a superhero. To be clear, 'Oppenheimer' is not a superhero movie. In fact, it's the exact opposite of one. Throughout the entire movie, we are seeing Robert Oppenheimer - Oppy to his followers - with all of his eccentricities, his romantic failings, his hubris, and his achievements laid completely bare. Cillian Murphy is able to shoulder this all and still cede screen time on a frequent basis to the likes of Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Kenneth Branagh, to say nothing of Robert Downey Jr. - who is, in effect, the antagonist of the entire piece. At three hours in total, 'Oppenheimer' leaves nothing to chance. We see Oppenheimer as a young man, drinking in the freedom of the twenties and exploring Europe and learning from the great minds of his time; his wide reading and his brilliance took inspiration from 'Das Kapital' to 'Bhagavad Gita' where a key quote is inserted into the middle of a sex scene with some weird, unsettling overtones. The framing device, however, is Oppenheimer in his later years and being forced to account for his entire life in an inquisition at the height of the Red Scare. As he recounts his time meeting with other scientists, his efforts to seek unionisation on the campus of his college, and his acceptance of all walks of life and political affiliation, you get a sense of just how at odds Oppenheimer was with the world. This comes into sharp focus when he's setting up Los Alamos, the colony of thinkers and scientists in the wilds of New Mexico, where the ""gadget"" was being built for use in World War II against Nazi Germany. Murphy's Oppenheimer switches from scientist to politician, navigating the pull of the American institutions who want the bomb for the awesome and terrifying power it holds, and his own fears of it. This is something that Christopher Nolan's script and direction capture in crystal clear precision - just how daunting and mind-warping the entire concept of an atom bomb truly was. There are frequent moments in 'Oppenheimer' where the crushing weight of this realisation proves too much, and you almost think Cillian Murphy's head is going to explode from the pressure of it all - and ours along with it. It's unbearable at times, to say nothing of the fears that lay in things like atmospheric ignition and the proliferation of nuclear weapons as a result. Yet Nolan's direction and script hold fast to this, living in that discomfort and tension without letting it slip away into something comfortable. Perhaps the most horrifying moment comes not during the detonation of the bomb, but afterwards when Oppenheimer delivers a rousing speech to the scientists who worked on the ""gadget"" as they celebrate its success. Structurally and in common with Nolan's works, 'Oppenheimer' flicks between timelines, but makes the transition between them relatively easy to follow - until it isn't, of course. The sense of scale that he often works with comes from the cast. Murphy, as mentioned, gives a fully realised portrayal of Oppenheimer - witty at times, wearied at others, but always with a captivating presence that ignites the passions of those around him. Downey Jr. is not to be ignored, and will likely join Murphy on the trail of awards at the end of the year. Sadly, both Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are decidedly underwritten and are squandered entirely. Maybe that's the point, of course, that Oppenheimer the character ignored or sidelined them as much as the movie did. In any event, 'Oppenheimer' is a towering triumph of a movie, and may very well rank as Nolan's best in years to come. Very few directors are able to fully capture and account for an entire person's life and achievements, and very few actors have the range and skill to carry it through. Yet, both Nolan and Murphy manage to set the movie in the same pantheon of iconic biopics. 'Gandhi' was one, 'Amadeus' was another. 'Malcolm X' and 'Lawrence of Arabia' both captured the glory and the fall and so too does 'Oppenheimer'.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","With a grand and expansive narrative to convey, Nolan seamlessly weaves together a multitude of themes and storylines, effortlessly delivering a cinematic experience that leaves no stone unturned.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," That dichotomy is basically how director Christopher Nolan paints his intellectual giant in this rich bio-pic about the man dubbed “the father of the atomic bomb.” ‘Oppenheimer” is a complex movie, adapted by Nolan from the biography, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Murphy gives a brilliantly nuanced performance as Oppenheimer. He is a genius; he knows and flaunts it, but he also craves the recognition and admiration of his gift from those within and outside the scientific community. Yet, despite his intellect, Murphy’s Oppenheimer — at times — is a man-child. He is naïve, failing to understand the intricacies of human nature and how quickly people can take advantage of him and how rapidly friends can become antagonists to suit their own purposes. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer’s hubris was partially the reason for his later downfall. They also display his contradictory nature. Yes, he led the building of the bomb, but was conflicted about the lives that would be lost in its use and what happens after this atomic genie was released from its bottle. At one point, Tatlock, a psychiatrist portrayed who is by Florence Pugh, warns Oppenheimer that he should not alienate or drive people away because one day he may need them. “Oppenheimer” is intellectually stimulating; sequences in which Oppenheimer and his team at Los Alamos debate about how to build an atomic bomb and the consequences of it are not only thought provoking but engaging. Nolan has filled “Oppenheimer” with actors who command the screen. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer brings a three-dimensional intricacy to her characterization. She loves her husband, but at times berates him for his infidelities and secretiveness, while admonishing him to stand up for himself when, during the Red Scare of the 1950s, the apparatus of the U.S. government turns on him. Robert Downey Jr. gives one of the best performances of his career as Lewis Strauss, head of the Atomic Energy Commission, whose behind-the-scenes machinations lead to Oppenheimer’s downfall. Downey’s portrayal of Strauss recalls Hamlet’s description of Claudius, his stepfather, “That one may smile and smile and be a villain.” Matt Damon is no-nonsense Gen. Leslie Groves Jr., the military head of the Manhattan Project, who must temper keeping the scientists on schedule and in line because of national security concerns. Others with smaller roles who stand out are Rami Malik as scientist David Hill, who for most of the movie is in the background, until coming to the defense of Oppenheimer in a very public manner; Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, Oppenheimer’s rival, who created the hydrogen bomb; and David Krumholtz as Isidor Rabi, a scientist who is Oppenheimer’s oldest friend. The cast also includes Alen Ehrenreich, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn and James Remar, who each receive moments to shine. The contribution of the sound department, led by Stefan Almqvist, is exceptional, especially the silence after the Trinity test of the bomb, which lasts for several seconds, until the blast wave reaches the onlookers; and the screams Oppenheimer hears in his head imagining the impact of the bomb’s devastation on Hiroshima. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, collaborating with Nolan for a fourth time, switching from color to flashback black-and-white sequences, enriches the mood of the film. He also provides us with glimpses of Oppenheimer’s mind and how he thinks outside the norm. “Oppenheimer” is, so far, the best movie of 2023. It deserves Academy Award consideration for picture, director, sound, cinematography, special effects, as well as acting nominations for Murphy, Downey Jr., Blunt and Pugh. “Oppenheimer” is provocative and impressive and, despite its massive canvas, intimate and personal. At its core, it is a story about how our country creates heroes, only to tear them down when they get out of step with whatever the current norm or climate happens to be.",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," Supported by an all-star cast, including Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Jason Clarke, and Kenneth Branagh, Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, a prickly intellectual with a thinly-veiled contempt for people in general, who all call him a genius and/or ‘the greatest mind of our generation,’ to the extent that it’s taken for granted that he must be a great man, even though the film never truly conveys why he is viewed as such an exalted man and with such awe and respect.  It’s kind of like The Wizard of Oz, except that Toto, played by Christopher Nolan, never succeeds in pulling the veil of mystery completely away from the Great and Powerful Oppenheimer. We’re left with the clear impression that he is unknowable, cloaked in mystery, his true nature never to be revealed.  Beginning with his first feature film, Following (1998), Nolan has manifested a great interest in the why and the when of human behavior, often framing his inquiries in a series of interlocking puzzles, as can be seen in Memento (2000), Insomnia (2002), The Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Tenet (2020). His Batman trilogy, together with Dunkirk (2017), are painted on a different sort of canvas, where characters drive their actions, motivated by comic book logic or historical records.  Returning to World War II and endeavoring to understand the environment that led to the creation of the Atom Bomb, obviously a turning point in human history, Nolan focuses on J. Robert Oppenheimer as a means to tell a larger story. He also plunges into Oppenheimer as a man out of his time, starting with Oppenheimer post-fame and glory as the so-called ‘father of the atom bomb’ to a time when he is under investigation for his past actions.  The motivation for the investigation appears to be a slight suffered by Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former head of the Atomic Energy Commission during World War II and later under consideration for a cabinet position in the U.S. Presidency. During World War II, Strauss approached Oppenheimer about heading up the Manhattan Project, which ultimately developed the atomic bomb. During that ‘approach,’ Oppenheimer spoke with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) in private; as Einstein walked away from the meeting, he ignored Strauss when the latter greeted him and was ignored.  We’re meant to understand that, infuriated by what he perceived as an intentional slight engineered by Oppenheimer, Strauss proceeded to act against Oppenheimer after the war, leading to Oppenheimer being humiliated, subjected to insulting questions from a senate judiciary panel, with Jason Clarke as lead bully/insulter Roger Robb, losing his standing in the scientific community and the world at large, and so forth and so on and on.  The endless questioning composes the majority of the third act of the movie, which is also when Oppenheimer himself, in the years after the atomic bomb killed hundreds of thousands of people in Japan, experienced heartfelt regret, even nightmares, over his actions at the behest of his government. The entire movie, then, is about how one man allowed his intense intellectual brilliance to blind him to what he was doing.  Really, it’s about how one man, obsessed with solving a puzzle, ignored the possible consequences of his actions, to the point that he blocked out what he was doing to the people around him, especially his destructive relationships with two women: the doomed Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and, later, his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt). At one point in the movie, he is called ‘a ladies’ man,’ though it’s difficult to see why, since he pays little attention to them beyond using Jean for sex and using Kitty for the facade of a family life, complete with children he rarely sees.  Perhaps that’s a commentary on how men viewed women in the 1940s. To be certain, though, it’s difficult to see how Oppenheimer inspires any friendships, though loyalty from a few men emerge much later. Mostly, it’s Oppenheimer, obsessed.  Raw in her emotions, Florence Pugh plays a pitiable character with burning intensity. Emily Blunt does her best to navigate a character whose motivation is never entirely clear. Matt Damon plays a military man overseeing the Manhattan Project and lends the movie its few lighter moments amidst his commanding actions as General Groves.  Even with all the fine performances and the absorbing production design, I’m sorry to say that Oppenheimer didn’t work for me. Certainly, I appreciate Christopher Nolan’s ambition, and desire to tell a story that needs to be told, but I felt like I was stuck in a classroom for three hours while a series of learned professors lectured me, hectoring me for being stupid, unable to understand or grasp the meaning of a Very Important Subject.  Ultimately, the movie portrays J. Robert Oppenheimer as an inscrutable character who deserves great accolades for making it possible for the U.S. to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Japan. Because Christopher Nolan consistently flashes back and forth in time, it’s difficult to grasp the import of his actions as they’re happening.  When the movie returns to the time period when it began, it also shifts the focus from Oppenheimer as an active participant, the leader, to a glum and unhappy victim of persecution by people who are themselves the true evil. Thus, it seems to equate the facilitating of mass murder with character assassination.  Now, certainly it can be argued that dropping the atom bombs shortened the war and saved American lives. Oppenheimer, as a movie, does not make that argument. Instead, it stays carefully away from presenting the Japanese perspective or the German perspective of the Russian perspective or the perspective of people who were living in Los Alamos, New Mexico, when the Manhattan Project came to town.  Very clearly, this is a portrait of one man and the times in which he lived, through his perspective. Memories and their haunted, destructive power play a part as well. Really, Oppenheimer is a giant puzzle that Christopher Nolan endeavors to decipher, and is not able to do so, to understand why he did what he did.  Note: this review is based on a single viewing, a local screening that was a complete disaster. Even though most of the audience arrived by 6:30 pm for the scheduled 7:00 pm screening, we were not allowed into the non-IMAX AMC Northpark auditorium until 7:43 or so, with the movie starting about 10 minutes later.  No reasons were given for the delay, but as soon as the movie started, I wondered why it looked so … terrible, like a videotape on a huge, 35mm screen, like we were watching through a screen door. At first I thought it was an artistic decision to make the opening scene or two different from what was to follow, but no: that was the entire movie! Perhaps needless to say, this made the entire experience rather miserable, with some scenes going out of focus to a distracting degree. I’m partially disabled, so I couldn’t go running down the stairs to ask an usher or the publicist what was happening. I sat there and tried to make the most of what I was watching.  Eventually, I concluded that the likely reason for the long, unexplained delay was that the projectionist was trying to fix whatever was wrong with what was on screen. Eventually, the decision was made — by someone, I don’t know who — that nothing more could be done, and so it was best to screen the movie as it was, and hope that no one would notice.  First as a festival screener, then as a film critic, I have watched many movies in less than optimal conditions, from worn VHS tapes to low-resolution DVDs to online screeners with my email address plastered across the middle of the screen. This, however, was the worst I have ever seen any movie projected in a movie theater.  To claim that it didn’t affect my opinion of the movie that I watched would be dishonest. Truthfully, it was like sitting with a burr under my backside for three hours.  Even so, given all that, I’m sorry to say that Oppenheimer didn’t work for me. Certainly, I appreciate Christopher Nolan’s ambition, and desire to tell a story that needs to be told, but I felt like I was stuck in a classroom for three hours while a series of learned professors lectured me, hectoring me for being stupid, unable to understand or grasp the meaning of a Very Important Subject.  The film opens Friday, July 19, via Universal Studios, at multiple locations throughout Dallas and Fort Worth. For more information about the film, visit the official site.  Whilst I appreciate the review (the little of which you have provided), your thoughts seem fragmented and muddled somewhat. You make no reference to the ethical, moral, personal, global implications of Oppenheimer and his work, you delve into no sufficient detail of the films cast, the lack of female expansion nor the excellent ways in which this film was shot and created. There is seldom regard for the outstanding performances of Murphy and RDJ who will undoubtedly and deservedly earn Oscar nods for their portrayals. Finally, you offer no comment of the current timeliness of this movie. Writing is the expression of our thoughts, you clearly have none, maybe get back into that classroom you revere so much until you can write something interesting and worthwhile. You are hackney’d to the hilt. Not a real reviewer and certainly not an individual who takes care and consideration over his craft. Hi Chris, you obviously do not have sufficient insight into what makes a really solid move.  You’re defending one made of plasterboard.  And, just like me, you’re showing the world that you’re a snitty, bitty, twitty, ditty,  pile of blechhh by wasting your time writing comment-trash on a website that nobody’s going to read.  At least I’m drunk.  You’re just a moron. You expended more paragraphs detailing the physical technical disturbances that ruined the experience for you than you did on the material you in theory were reviewing. Six vs five. This isn’t a review. It’s a rant. I’ll admit that I haven’t seen the movie yet, but I am midway through American Prometheus, the book upon which it is based.  That said, I also worked in missile defense and was mentored by some engineers who worked on Reagan’s SDI (Star Wars) programs.  Ironically enough,  Dr. Edward Teller (father of the H-Bomb) lectured at my school.  So…admittedly, this is right up my alley, and I am very excited to go watch it. As for Oppenheimer being “unknowable,” I don’t know that that is true, but Oppenheimer is definitely a paradox and definitely an anomaly.   A common complaint about Oppenheimer from his peers was his arrogant tendency to make cutting remarks intended to make their target feel stupid or mediocre.  Indeed, that is part of the reason he was disliked.  On the other hand, he was universally regarded as brilliant and uniquely capable of absorbing the entirety of his undertaking.  That is precisely why he was chosen for his role.  Strangely, he was also very poetically inclined–who else would have quoted the Bhagavad Gita in response to witnessing the Trinity test? Why don’t you go see the movie again and actually watch it, and then update this review.  235 words?  Seriously?
This is about as bad as the 1 star product reviews on Amazon because the post office messed up the delivery.
You’re making movie critics look terrible. This article simply shouldn’t have been written. At least not as a review of the film submitted to websites like Rotton Tomatoes. You should be ashamed of yourself. I wrote 235 words about the movie itself and my reaction to it. That qualifies as a review, per guidelines I have received from Rotten Tomatoes, which does not have a minimum word count requirement. Wild how he basically admits he’s reviewing the moving going experience as much as the movie. When I saw Up a child was frequently kicking the back of my seat and crying; it was a nightmare. The movie, however, was sublime.  I think it was very brave for you to basically not discuss the movie at all. This review is basically you whining to whoever set you up with tickets. As far as published criticism goes, this is 0/100– this is something for your tumblr. I’ve learned nothing, except maybe not to see this movie in Texas. Thanks for the tourist tip. Dude if you can’t see a movie in at least semi-optimal conditions, don’t review it. That’s like leaving a bad review for a restaurant because you couldn’t find parking.

"Jul 19, 2023","  Like the brilliant scientist it takes as its subject, Oppenheimer arrives at a crucial moment in history. At a time when almost every big-budget Hollywood movie (including its opening weekend rival, Barbie) is drawn from corporate intellectual property, Oppenheimer is an unapologetically brainy movie with great actors playing real people, a true story with important details many viewers will be learning for the first time, and which, despite its roots in reality, feels massive and worthy of director Christopher Nolan's beloved IMAX screen.
  As the title makes clear, this movie is about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the ""father of the atomic bomb."" For most of the three-hour runtime, Nolan places the viewer inside Oppenheimer's prodigious brain. We see the world as this theoretical physicist did, meaning the action is often interrupted by incredible visions of subatomic particles and cosmic fire. Yet Oppenheimer also has aspects of a memory play, or at least an exhaustive biography cut up and shuffled around. Even more than Nolan's previous film, Tenet, Oppenheimer flits about in time, effortlessly moving in and out of different events that took place across several decades, drawing connections that are logical but far from linear.
  Embodying the man at the center of this universe, the constant in this shifting sea of science and history, is therefore no easy task — but Cillian Murphy rises to the challenge with an absolutely absorbing performance. Murphy has been working with Nolan for years, often in key supporting roles such as the villainous Scarecrow in Batman Begins and the primary target of Inception's dream heist. But the actor has proved his leading-man bona fides elsewhere (most recently in the long-running Netflix crime series Peaky Blinders) and finally brings that side of his skillset home to Nolan. No question, the close-ups on Murphy's face as Oppenheimer thinks through the 20th century's thorniest problems are as compelling as the film's atomic explosions, and as deserving of the biggest screen possible.
  But just as Oppenheimer, for all his world-historical genius, could only accomplish his great feat because he was surrounded by many other brilliant thinkers, so is Murphy supported by a galaxy of top-notch actors. Matt Damon brings his movie-star charisma to General Leslie Groves, the military head of the Manhattan Project whose gruff charms obscures his ulterior motives.
  Robert Downey Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer's rival for control over postwar nuclear policy, and uses his own considerable acting powers to carve out a sizable portion of the film for himself. Strauss' strategy meetings amidst contentious 1959 Senate hearings over his cabinet nomination are the only scenes not set from Oppenheimer's direct perspective, signified both by their black-and-white color grading and Downey's domination of the screen. Downey was one of the most popular and influential American movie stars of the 2010s, but through some mixture of pandemic-era delays and post-Marvel malaise, it's been years since we've seen him in top form. Watching Downey give such a meaty big-screen performance again is not an opportunity to be squandered — especially considering the meta resonance of Downey and Nolan, who each played foundational roles in the rise of the modern superhero blockbuster, collaborating on a film about an inventor feeling ambivalent about his great creation.
  Another Jewish critic of the supposedly anti-Nazi atomic bomb is Albert Einstein, whom Tom Conti plays with the levity of an old legend who has seen the world transformed by his greatest accomplishment (the theory of relativity) in a way he does not care for. By the time the film ends, Oppenheimer will understand how he feels. After all, the atomic bomb was ultimately not used to defeat the Nazis, but to incinerate Japanese civilians.
  The Manhattan Project was mostly a boys' club, as many of Nolan's past movies have been. Of all the criticisms the highly-successful director has attracted throughout his career, the stickiest is that his female characters are often ""dead wives,"" whose ghostly after-images serve merely as motivation for the male protagonists. But Emily Blunt's Kitty Oppenheimer is defiantly alive, in spite of the worldwide crises of the '30s and '40s. Far from the archetype of a ""devoted wife,"" Kitty is not shy about expressing her frustrations with motherhood or her dissatisfaction with politics. Blunt is a great partner for Murphy in their scenes together: bringing him down to Earth when he's off in the clouds, reminding him to fight when he seems content to let history wash over him.
  The other primary female character in the film, Jean Tatlock, is played by Florence Pugh. The rising star feels a bit out of place standing alongside her older and more experienced costars, but Pugh brings Oppenheimer a heaping helping of sex and politics — two sides of life that have often been missing from Nolan's earlier films. Tatlock was a committed communist, and attended several party meetings alongside Oppenheimer (who was disturbed by the rise of genocidal Nazism and wanted to support the anti-fascist Republicans in the Spanish Civil War).
  The film's attention to political history contributes to its sense of timeliness. Here is a summer blockbuster whose characters vigorously discuss the importance of labor unions and anti-fascist organizing, arriving just as Hollywood's real-life unions are walking picket lines. (The stars even left the film's glitzy premiere as soon as the SAG-AFTRA strike began.) Though viewers might expect Oppenheimer to climax with the Trinity Test at Los Alamos (which is indeed spectacular), the film spends a final hour exploring the 1954 closed-door hearing where Oppenheimer's security clearance was revoked for his ties to communists. Standing in for the McCarthyite era at large, these scenes demonstrate how despite the Allied victory over the fascists, the use of Oppenheimer's atomic bomb empowered reactionaries at home to betray the very people who made their victory possible.
  Content meets form here. Oppenheimer is full of heady topics like quantum mechanics and political history, which few viewers will consider themselves experts on. But the film explains these ideas in ways more creative than the exposition dumps of Inception or the just-roll-with-it chaos of Tenet. When Oppenheimer first meets Kitty, she asks him to explain quantum physics. He does so by saying that everything in existence is composed of individual atoms, strung together by forces that make matter seem solid to our eyes, even though it's essentially not. In their next scene, Kitty explains how her second husband was a union organizer who died fighting fascists in Spain. Her life, which seemed solid, was completely undone by a single tiny bullet. Oppenheimer gets to experience this firsthand in 1954, when people who he thought of as allies and friends betray him for their own personal gain.

"Jul 19, 2023"," There’s nothing small scale about Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, a thundering three-hour dive into the tumultuous life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, theoretical physicist, architect of America’s Manhattan Project, ‘father of the atomic bomb’. That dubious title would haunt him till the end of his days and he became a vocal proponent of detente, but nothing it seemed could wash away his mortal sin. Pale and gaunt, cast in shadows, Cillian Murphy (well cast and never better) is an agonised figure, his suffering central to an ambitious and multi-layered film that portrays him as both sinner and saint. But visiting Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) sees real potential in the chippy American and tells him to go to Germany to study under Max Born. Which makes him the perfect man to head up the Los Alamos Laboratory, a secret project initiated by Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941 to develop a nuclear bomb. The group of scientists that Oppenheimer assembled would become central to the subsequent Manhattan Project and it was Oppy who chose the New Mexican wilderness as the site for the bomb’s gestation. But Oppenheimer’s flirtations with communism in the 1930s would later return to haunt him when his vocal opposition to the development of a hydrogen bomb put him in the sights of the McCarthy witch hunts. However flawed in his private life, Oppy was in some ways a man of principle, who incurred Harry Truman’s displeasure by openly questioning the morality of nuclear weapons. Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock, communist activist, Oppenheimer’s on-off lover and a tragic malcontent, while Emily Blunt is Kitty Puening, Oppy’s loyal and long-suffering wife. Matt Damon is General Groves, the scientist’s gruff overseer at Los Alamos, and Robert Downey Jr is Lewis Strauss, the slick businessman and politician who is Oppenheimer’s ally. The acting in Oppenheimer is uniformly excellent and Murphy seems sure to get an Oscar nomination at least: his Oppy is watchful, remote, ultimately unknowable, a seething mass of moral and philosophical contradictions. As a piece of entertainment, Nolan’s film is impeccable: the three hours fly by and his sleight of hand in recounting a devilishly complex tale is remarkable. But the way he uses sound and music to ratchet up the tension as the first detonation approaches is exceptional: Nolan’s film-making style is bombastic, unnuanced, but undeniably effective. When those bombs are ready for use over Japan, Nolan makes a big decision: we only hear about the consequences of those explosions, and are shown none of the biblical misery they unleashed. And Murphy gives us a tragic protagonist of Shakespearean proportions, not so much Prometheus as Icarus, a thin-skinned, tortured man whose ambition was his worst enemy.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The story: This portrait of the man known as the father of the atomic bomb, American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), puts a spotlight on his time as the World War II director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, heading a scientific team trying to build the weapon ahead of the Germans. His relationships with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt) are shown, along with his interactions with friends and colleagues in science and government, such as businessman and bureaucrat Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr). Adapted from the 2005 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph And Tragedy Of J. Robert Oppenheimer, written by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin.  Jessica Chastain’s Murphy Cooper had to solve a mathematics equation to take humanity off a doomed Earth in Interstellar (2014). In Inception (2010), Dom (Leonardo DiCaprio) commands the respect of the dream heist team because he keeps proving to be the smartest guy in the room.  In the American Prometheus book, Nolan found a hyperintelligent main character with a real supermind who has to, as Blunt puts it in an interview, “live with the trauma of that brain”.  The “tragedy” in the book’s title gives a clue about the price he pays for being able to see inside the atom, but failing to read the motives of those who feel threatened by his cognitive prowess. Nolan likes to play with the format of storytelling as much as he likes telling the story, so this film features a non-linear chronological structure, in addition to techniques such as giving speaking parts to a platoon of scientists, leading to a bottom-numbing three-hour runtime. This reviewer wishes that he could call Oppenheimer a triumph because Nolan’s technical innovations deserve recognition. But the non-linear timeline appears to be an attempt at creating psychological depth and tonal unity out of a creation that covers too much ground.  In the 180 minutes can be found a lengthy courtroom drama, a doomed romance between troubled leftist academics and a celebratory account of the Manhattan Project.  Nolan loves his temporal shifts – see his crime thriller Memento (2000) and the action thriller Tenet (2020) – but, here, the effect is not so much dazzling as it is dizzying. That said, this work is still worth a watch because of the strong performances given by Downey Jr, Pugh, Blunt and, most of all, the serene yet alert Murphy, an actor who was born to play a man with a lot going on in his head. Hot take:  At times sprawling and undisciplined, and at others, inspired, this is one of those films that one would watch once, but probably never again – unless it was in the form of online clips of individual moments and performances.

"Jul 19, 2023"," It’s just early summer and we already have a strong Oscar contender with Christopher Nolan’s new historical drama. I will say, I haven’t been a fan of Nolan’s last three films – Interstellar, Dunkirk, and Tenet were just too convoluted, boring, and loud. However, I am pleased to say, Oppenheimer is one the director’s best films to date. In the 1940s, J. Robert Oppenheimer and a team of brilliant scientists traveled into the unknown to create the ultimate weapon of mass destruction, the atomic bomb, but with the good intention that it would be used to end the war. Of course, when using a weapon with that kind of explosive power there’s risk and moral dilemmas. Which brings into play, Oppenheimer’s infamous quote, “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.” Haunting words that travel with audiences throughout the entire film. The movie stars Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downy Jr., and the list goes on! Nolan has brought in a large cast of well-known actors to show just how many important figures Oppenheimer encountered throughout his turbulent career. As I mentioned before, Nolan’s recent films have been about “going big” and caring more about the visuals and sound versus his script. This time around he stays more focused with his subject matter. As we follow Oppenheimer, we get to really know the scientist, both intellectually and emotionally. He has his flaws as a husband, but seems to truly want to help mankind with the making of this bomb. And when it is used successfully, the internal struggle that comes after is relatable, heartbreaking, and terrifying. Yes, the bomb was used to ultimately save over a hundred thousand lives, but what about the innocent ones that were lost? This is a conflicting thought that stays with you long after the film is over. The film’s 3-hour runtime may be daunting, but the fast-paced editing prevents the drama from dragging. Warning, there’s not a whole lot of breathing room between each scene, so you’ll want to be alert for the quick storytelling. The visuals aren’t necessarily Nolan’s most memorable, but they are powerful, along with the unique use of score and the disheartening war sound effects. Oppenheimer is a poignant and engaging character study revolving around a true story that all audiences must-see.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer is in some ways, the summation of everything Christopher Nolan has been saying throughout his entire career thus far. A lot of it is conveyed through dialogue - an endless sea of quandary, debate, theory and apprehension. At some points in this film, I was convinced I was watching Nolan’s masterpiece but it’s also hard for me to fully cement that once we get to the very end. Like most experiences I have with movies these days, a second viewing could bump up those moments of awe into a semblance of solidified brilliance. Also like a lot of newer films, I felt exhausted by its running time to where I almost wish there was an intermission. Maybe I should watch this while drinking coffee and taking notes! One of the reasons I could never imagine myself at a week-long film festival where I have to consume four or five titles in a day, is that I need time to sit and process what I’ve seen. It’s clear that my mind is still racing from what I just watched to the point where I felt inundated with ideas. It reminded me of what I first experienced with Oliver Stone’s JFK and Nixon - two movies I would eventually grow to love over time. Around the years of seeing those two titles, all I could think of was that Duran Duran song, “Too Much Information.” Slow down, let me absorb it all. Oppenheimer is damn-near relentless in a way that is both invigorating and tiring by the end (in a good way). Inspired by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s seminal 2005 biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer is an account of the events that led to its eponymous theoretical physicist becoming one of the most lauded, hated, and infamous men in human history for his role in developing the atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy’s eyes are some of the most expressive you’ll ever see, conveying so much to where Oppenheimer often doesn’t need to say anything - it’s all right there despite a layer of quiet stoicism. His portrayal of Oppenheimer is a career best for him, without question but the cast of character actors are also providing ample support.  Oppenheimer's research and innovative organization proposals lead Gen. Groves (Matt Damon) to hire Oppenheimer as director of the Manhattan Project. The government builds the town of Los Alamos to Oppenheimer's specifications. As with so much of Nolan’s prior work, Oppenheimer is chronologically fractured, recounting its tale from two perspectives: that of Oppenheimer, in color, and of Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss (an exceptional Robert Downey, Jr.), in black-and-white.  In accordance with that structure, the film casts its dual strands as flashbacks told by these characters during, respectively, the secret, Red Scare-driven 1954 hearing that cost Oppenheimer his security clearance and the 1959 Senate hearing that denied Strauss the Secretary of Commerce position he coveted. There is also a private meeting of military minds in a sequestered space in which legal counsel attempts to make sense of precisely why they’re questioning Oppenheimer’s past actions - a process that may or may not lead to a renewal of his security clearance. All of this interweaves like clockwork but it takes a while to acclimate.  As a technical marvel, this is a monumental achievement. The editing by Jennifer Lame is rhythmic and beautifully choreographed. The sound design is perfectly pitched punctuation (often in the form of a silent ellipsis or a pulsating exclamation point). The stunning cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema captures everything from New Mexico to black-and-white Senate hearings in ways that showcase why actual film should be preserved. Sometimes in the confines of a confined room there is a sense of being imprisoned within indecision and uncertainty. Not to mention the accompanying intensity of a relentless score by Ludwig Göransson that makes you feel every beat often sounding like an amalgam of Jóhann Jóhannsson and Hans Zimmer. There’s no denying how powerful the elements are and they come together for the ultimate must-see film-going experience… yes in a theater.  I kept thinking about the idea of Pandora’s Box, a terrible power unleashed in the hands of the impulsive. This is the stuff of gods and men with little control over what happens as a result of their creation. But it’s more than that. What does an invention that ultimately leads to immeasurable casualties do to its creator on a psychological level? One of the more interesting things about Christopher Nolan’s process this time is going outside the box with blasts of energy - both atomic and human. We see Oppenheimer’s perspective including big bright flashes of anxiety especially once he’s come to the realization that he’s responsible for so many deaths.  I’m still not sure if Nolan is capable of writing fully realized female characters despite all of them giving great performances here. Pugh is under-utilized as a mistress that has no aspirations of being tied-down, at least at first. Also undeveloped is briefly showcasing the contributions of Lilli Hornig (Olivia Thirlby). Blunt, as Kitty is consistently great as expected, given a much juicier role but aside from a scene of questioning, feels reduced to a depressed alcoholic with no inner life or backstory - an afterthought which could very well have been the case for Oppenheimer himself. He was addicted to his work. The scenes of him collaborating with a crew of highly intelligent scientists recall Nolan at his best. I never mind when he indulges in exposition and analysis (yes even in Inception). Sometimes I get the feeling we’re both interested in the same things - particularly the moral, ethical and psychological ramifications of doing something both audacious and dangerous. Especially when it could, in turn, lead to the end of humanity.  At every turn, a superb supporting performance lies in wait from Damon, Blunt, Kenneth Branagh, Macon Blair, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein. Special mention goes to Robert Downey Jr, given far more to do than playing a tired superhero finally, as well as David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi, an Oppenheimer associate whose initial moral qualms about joining the Manhattan Project are eventually shared by Oppenheimer and, in the end, by the film. I’m not sure if the suggestions of a spy subplot involving said side characters was necessary - an afterthought that could’ve been excised for a tighter running time. As the film goes on, we do learn of a conspiracy of sorts that comes together wonderfully. Some surreal moments convey Oppenheimer's feelings of guilt and remorse, both in matters of his infidelity and facilitating weapons of mass destruction. There’s one in particular that truly does not work (it elicited laughter) involving an imagined Pugh taking “part” in the deposition. Part of me was wondering - is Nolan going to get weird and make the kind of choices that were made like in The Master? But this is mostly just a random choice to get weird that felt out of place. I think what holds it back from being a masterpiece is simply not going all in with the surreality. It was mostly just hinted at here and there. Part of me wants to see Nolan get weird and weirder! The kind of damage this has done to Oppenheimer psyche is obvious - he is a sensitive person, not just a cog in the military machine programmed to create chaos in the way that the Joker did. It’s clear he genuinely struggles - having too much knowledge and being able to comprehend the world of quantum mechanics effortlessly is bound to have consequences especially when there’s mounting pressure to dominate and beat the Russians at their own game. Nolan’s choice to go in-depth to how this affected him is one of the best components of the film, along with the stellar editing from different points in time that are never confusing but endlessly compelling.  Oppenheimer is a complex, dense film with many layers - most of which I responded to quite strongly. The final moment involving Albert Einstein is something I couldn’t shake. It led me to believe that this film could potentially have a lot to say about man’s tendency to openly adopt the death drive. Death is inevitable for us all and in some ways, war tries to justify its inevitability. It’s as if self-destruction comes with having eyes and ears. Why else would we build a bomb that almost assures an ending of civilization? We may think life is about survival but why are those in power so drawn to the impulse to destroy those who challenge us? Our country will always retaliate and dominate - it’s practically how we were founded, it’s in our DNA. This film really does delve deep and considers the macro-level implication and the effect it has on one fragile, but brilliant mind.  I admit, maybe I shouldn’t have been taken aback by how talky this entire experience was, because the ideas expressed throughout resonate. I also wonder if this is the ultimate Christopher Nolan film even if there’s very little in the way of effects outside of the moment involving the Trinity test. (Keep in mind - all in-camera and practical). Perhaps after the action spectacles of Tenet and Interstellar (still my favorite Nolan film), it was time to go inward and personal again. Nolan is also driven by a love of science and keen intellect, and he respects the audience to almost become the students to these professors and revolutionaries (even if some were mad with power). There’s a lot to lecture about.  To me the overall experience felt akin to reading a great book but that’s not to say it isn’t a visual feat of the highest caliber. See this in a movie theater, in 70mm preferably. Just try to see it with someone who loves to overthink, analyze and possibly be okay with the fact that through what Oppenheimer has achieved, it may in fact lead to our own extinction. It is a profoundly devastating film in a way, but we never get to see the effects it had on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we mainly just feel the impact of what happens when one becomes the destroyer of all worlds.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," In filmmaking there’s a fine line between elegance and pretension, and Christopher Nolan, a citizen of both nations, criss-crosses the border freely. His dedication to craft is always right there on the screen, even in films you may not like; for better or worse, you can usually feel the thought vibrations that went into his decisions about where to put the camera, or how to move the actors around. He knows his stuff, and he makes sure we know that he knows. His expertise gleams like a family crest, looking great when it’s discreetly stamped on a piece of silver, though you really wouldn’t want it on a beach towel. There may be times in Oppenheimer when you look at the screen and think, Oh brother! as Nolan razzle-dazzles us with impressionistic inset shots of psychotically whirling stars and billowing plumes of what looks like molten lava, all while the lead character expounds in voiceover on the nature of matter, the universe, and other stuff. But either despite its intense craft or because of it, Oppenheimer works. In telling the story of genius theoretical physicist and atomic-bomb architect J. Robert Oppenheimer—played, with an almost otherworldly luminosity, by Cillian Murphy—Nolan blurs the distinction between grandeur and grandiosity. Both his subject and his lead actor can stand up to the outsize scale of his approach, so why shouldn’t he go for broke? So few filmmakers know how to make, or are able to make, pictures this big, about grown-up subjects. Nolan shapes Oppenheimer’s story into something like an epic poem, focusing not just on his most famous achievement, but on everything that happened to him afterward; Nolan is maybe even more interested in Oppenheimer as a complicated, questioning patriot. As you know if you’ve seen even just one Nolan film—it could be Memento, or Interstellar—he likes to scramble the signals in his storytelling. Oppenheimer is a story told in dots and dashes, demanding that you keep up with its shifts in time and space. But even if you know nothing about Oppenheimer’s story, following along is not that hard—Nolan pulls it all together at the end, and from that vantage point, the landscape of where he’s taken us looks pretty grand. We get some background on Oppenheimer’s time as a young student at Cambridge, homesick for America (he was born in New York) and tormented, as he tells us in those voiceovers, by the secrets of an “alien universe.” (Here’s where those visions of blasting stars and looping ribbons of light, accompanied by jarring, staticky noises, come in.) An early encounter with one of his heroes, Danish physicist Niels Bohr (a half-jaunty, half-regal Kenneth Branagh), recalibrates his thinking. He goes to museums, stares at paintings by Braque and Picasso, and something clicks. The music of the universe begins to make more sense. Oppenheimer begins to think and feel more furiously. There’s some writing on a chalkboard—in scientist movies, there always is—but Nolan uses the conceit sparingly and with some delicacy. He knows, as we do, that the scritch of chalk is a lot more romantic than the squeak of a Dry Erase marker. Nolan toggles between the distant past and the less-distant past, shifting between black-and-white film stock to muted color as he focuses on three central episodes in Oppenheimer’s story. (The movie’s source is Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2006 biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer.) One of these is the 1954 hearing that ultimately led to the revocation of Oppenheimer’s security clearance, ending his career in government and eroding his status as an academic. Jason Clarke’s Roger Robb oversees the proceedings, wearing a carved-stone face that’s decided “guilty” long before he’s even heard any of Oppenheimer’s own testimony, or that of his witnesses. The problem was that after Oppenheimer had pulled off the achievement, both extraordinary and tragic, of developing the bomb that would end World War II, his government, which no longer really needed him, decided it was time to question his loyalty—though the FBI had already been dogging him for years, collecting possible evidence against him. After the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer had also expressed moral qualms about the horrors that he’d helped unleash upon the world, and worried about the misuse of nuclear weapons in the future. Nolan balances that 1954 security hearing with another set of hearings before the Senate, convened to confirm—or not, as it turned out—Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a founding member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to the position of Secretary of Commerce under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Downey’s performance, equal parts subtly scented aftershave and snake oil, is a double-dealing marvel. By now, you may have figured that there a lot of men swirling around Oppenheimer, and we haven’t even gotten to the sections of the movie set in Los Alamos, where Oppenheimer led a team of scientists in the top-secret activities of the Manhattan Project. (They’re played by actors including, but not limited to, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, and Josh Harnett, plus the sole woman, Olivia Thirlby.) When they test their super-duper bomb in the desert, they put on little goggles and avert their eyes during the blast—their self-protective measures are both comical and horrifying. There’s a lot going on in Oppenheimer, and it can leave your brain a little scrambled. But Nolan never loses sight of Oppenheimer the man. We get a sense of Oppenheimer’s early adjacency to the Communist Party (though he never officially joined), another convenient strike against him during that 1954 hearing. There’s also a grievous and, for Oppenheimer, heartbreaking affair with a 1930s cool-girl party member, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh)—the love scenes between the two involve some tastefully lit but not-unaffecting nudity, as well as the reading of Sanskrit. (Always interesting to imagine how great scientists do it.) Nolan is working with so many moving parts here that it would be logical to wonder: does Murphy, his star, even get enough screen time? But Nolan ensures that the movie belongs to him. It’s a wonderful performance, somber without being deadening, and ultimately haunting. What’s it like to be married to a hot genius? (One of the accusations often flung at Oppenheimer was that he was a “womanizer,” though that word has differing meanings depending on who’s applying them, and how.) Emily Blunt gives us a sense of that in her portrayal of Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, also the mother of his two children. There’s no single scene that brings this complex and not particularly blissful marriage to life; it’s only late in the film, when Oppenheimer asserts that these two have “walked through fire” together, that you get a sense of the ironclad bond between them. Murphy doesn’t play Oppenheimer as the distracted-genius husband; it’s more that he accepts that his life must unfold on numerous shifting planes, each distinct from but affecting the others. You can’t apply quantum mechanics to human behavior. Most important of all, Nolan doesn’t disguise or downplay his sympathy for Oppenheimer the man and the scientist. In that sense, his movie is bracingly honest. He also doesn’t try to oversimplify Oppenheimer’s crises of conscience—they were anything but simple, as Nolan and Murphy show in several scenes underscoring the fact that World War II had to end sooner rather than later, to save the lives of both American and Japanese troops—the casualties on both sides were mounting astronomically day by day and week by week. Yet how could anyone involved in the creation of that bomb not question his or her role after the fact, especially with the benefit of hindsight? Murphy, like Oppenheimer, has a frame that looks to be built from matchsticks, almost too fragile-seeming to support that big brain on top. And his skin has a papery, translucent quality; there are moments when you feel you can almost see his nerve endings quivering beneath. That’s acting for the big screen. And it’s what a great actor can do when a filmmaker hands him a very big story, played out on a canvas designed for great leaps of imagination.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," It's plain for all to see in cinemas from Friday: Cillian Murphy has joined the Oscars race with his portrayal of 'the father of the atomic bomb' J Robert Oppenheimer. In the biggest lead role of his film career to date and his finest performance on the big screen, the Cork actor already has one accolade in the bag from five minutes in, namely that you can't imagine anyone else playing the theoretical physicist in this movie. And who knows? Depending on how the next few months shape up, Oppenheimer's Academy Awards haul could see Best Actor making its way across the Atlantic. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin, this 'biographical thriller' from writer-director Christopher Nolan - his sixth project with Murphy after The Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception and Dunkirk - justifies its three-hour duration from the 1920s to the 1960s. Indeed, for a film so dialogue-heavy and with only one set piece two hours in, that being the atomic bomb test in the New Mexico desert in July 1945, Oppenheimer moves remarkably fast and is tense from start to finish. It's boosted by the strongest of support from Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr as two key players in Oppenheimer's story: Major General Leslie Groves, the director of the top-secret Manhattan Project to build the bomb; and Lewis Strauss, the boss of the US Atomic Energy Commission, respectively. Here, an every-second-counts energy courses through scenes involving science, morality and political power plays, with the audience in constant suspense - while knowing all along how the man at the centre will ensure that our world will never be the same again. Different things read or seen will reappear in each viewer's mind as they watch. For this one, thoughts turned to the BBC's still-as-terrifying 1984 nuclear war drama Threads and also the immortal line said by Alec Guinness at the end of Bridge on the River Kwai: ""What have I done?""  As Oppenheimer stands at the entrance to the Los Alamos Laboratory, we see the bombs going out the gate on the backs of trucks. When word arrives that they have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Nolan conveys the horror of hundreds of thousands dead with a spine-chilling economy. The faults to find in Oppenheimer are few. Emily Blunt, playing Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, is underwritten but rescued by two brilliant moments at the end. There's also a clunky juxtaposition as Oppenheimer becomes a Cold War casualty that doesn't suit a director as accomplished as Nolan. That said, he has delivered his best work so far, without doubt, and also his most important - its power maximised through Nolan's choice of spectral leading man. ""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it,"" says Oppenheimer as his warning travels through the decades to the present day. © RTÉ 2024.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Now that the drum-beating has peaked, we can see for ourselves what Christopher Nolan has wrought in Oppenheimer, as unlikely a major-studio summer movie as ever was. It’s all dressed up in IMAX and 70mm but what we get is a fairly traditional biopic, no better or worse than many others of recent and distant memory. We even get to see the cast in old-age makeup, but we don’t ever learn what made the man tick. I haven’t read Nolan’s source material, Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, so I can’t assess its value as opposed to the film. Being a Nolan screenplay, the story is told in nonlinear fashion. Cillian Murphy, with his open, seemingly guileless expression, is completely convincing as the scientist known as the father of the atomic bomb who, after building it, counseled against its use and made many enemies in the process. But no one can get inside the head of a genius—be it a painter or a composer or a brilliant scientist, so we don’t leave the theater with a feeling of knowing what Oppy was all about, except on the surface. (There is even a glimpse of Albert Einstein, played by that wonderful actor Tom Conti.) We see Oppenheimer at various stages of his life, in Europe and in the States, especially at Los Alamos, New Mexico, where the bomb was created. We meet his on-again, off-again mistress (Florence Pugh) and his wife (Emily Blunt), who finds her husband’s passivity infuriating when he is publicly humiliated by our government in the years following World War II. Other supporting roles are filled by a top-notch ensemble including Matt Damon, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, and Kenneth Branagh, to name just a few. I couldn’t figure out who was playing President Harry S. Truman and felt foolish when I read the closing credits. You can look it up or be as surprised as I was. Does all of this warrant three bladder-challenging hours of running time? The answer, not surprisingly, is no. The final half-hour is dominated by Robert Downey Jr.’s character, Lewis Strauss, former head of the Atomic Energy Commission who seizes the opportunity to smear Oppenheimer’s reputation in the 1950s. While true, focusing on Strauss’s fury shifts the balance of the film away from its protagonist and becomes an unwelcome distraction. I’m not sure why IMAX was the filmmaker’s choice for this subject, aside from the fact that he likes the supersized format. Its vaunted sound system makes the most of the bomb test scenes, especially the climactic burst in New Mexico, but the majority of the picture is told in closeups and medium shots. Nolan has used his clout to shoot and edit on motion picture film and for this he earns my utmost respect and admiration. But for all we learn about the creation and execution of the atomic bomb and its aftermath, the story could and should be told in a more digestible form. Instead, we have an overlong narrative that isn’t revelatory or surprising. (For another fascinating look at what went on at Los Alamos in the 1940s, check out the cable TV series Manhattan, which debuted in 2014 and never amassed the audience it deserved. You can stream it on Amazon Prime and other channels.)",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," hen J. Robert Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) security clearance renewal is denied, he’s allowed to appear before a panel to appeal the decision. Doing so finds him reflecting on his monumental life’s work, from his early days as a professor of theoretical physics at UC Berkeley, to his recruitment into the Manhattan Project where he led a team in developing the first nuclear weapons. The numerous scientists he worked with and learned from, including Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), and Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), had a major impact on his career, while the upshot of WWII shaped his political agenda, his opposition to hydrogen bombs, and his run-ins with government officials accusing him of harboring communist sentiments. As Oppenheimer wages a losing battle against his judges, he contemplates the effects his professional accomplishments have had on his personal life, including with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), as well as the cataclysmic changes his creation has inflicted upon the entire world. Opting for a now-standard, aggravatingly disjointed timeline, the plot bounds back and forth between numerous locations and years (some in black-and-white), touching upon varying ages, historical figures, political arenas, and scientific milestones – all within the first few minutes. Plus, countless insert shots keep the editing overwrought, as molecules, fire, stars, and unidentifiable atomic reactions dance across the frame. It’s needlessly artistic, though it’s evident that writer/director Christopher Nolan, who previously helmed such ambitious sci-fi extravaganzas as “Interstellar” and “Tenet,” desperately wants to avoid a commonplace presentation for this production. Some unnecessary yet conspicuous nudity and an ever-present score also help to fuel this goal. “I support a range of causes.” That soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson tends to manipulate, reverberating heavily with ominous tones, or amplifying nerve-jangling violins to augment routine events; everything is a little more intense when musical cues push viewers to anticipate or fret. But “Oppenheimer” is far removed from Nolan’s usual projects; here, there aren’t grand action sequences or even extensive special effects to fall back on. Despite all the technical refinements, this is a rather straightforward biography, introducing new characters and sets continuously as Robert proceeds toward (or through or after) breakthroughs and accomplishments, finding himself ensnared in tumultuous relationships, governmental complications, and political turmoil. A considerable amount of the film focuses on strained romances, familial contentions, and workplace disagreements. The normalcy may be heightened from McCarthy-era paranoia and persecution, but none of it is as interesting as the race to build the bomb, which is practically an afterthought when it comes to the quantity of supporting material that surrounds Oppenheimer’s most notable contribution. Will audiences be stimulated by WWII politics when traditional wartime fervor is absent? Will they care about Cold War spy games when it’s only represented in dialogue? Or the awesome, destructive powers of atomic bombs when they’re shown only as aftermaths (and even then, solely reactionary, as actual archival footage/photography is withheld from the screen)? “They split the atom!” Some of the discussions between geniuses and grunts and suits are mildly humorous, while the performances all around are first-rate. But the melodrama at the start – followed by a “Reds” level of political commentary and intrigue, historical components of the Manhattan Project, secretive affairs, suspicions of moles, military scrutiny, a problematic home life, the rush to test the bomb, a bureaucratically-orchestrated character assassination and kangaroo court showdown (legal thriller staples), and legacy shortcomings – pad the premise to a gargantuan degree. There are virtually three different, complete movies lurking within this ludicrously overlong piece, each exhibiting distinct genres and subjects, and each appearing inconsequential to the chapters that preceded them (out of order, of course). The best section of this colossal biography is the tense build to the Trinity test, which escalates theatrically to what is essentially the most prominent climax. Science, though never delved into in much detail, is quite exhilarating. But its placement too far away from the actual conclusion is a curious misstep; the denouement is one of the most interminable, dragging, and unexciting of all third acts. It doesn’t help that the cast, though capable, is devoid of heroes, as everyone is self-serving, corrupt, backstabbing, or plainly reprehensible. Oppenheimer, the man, is altogether less engaging than his invention, its impact on the world, and the fatal consequences of its use. The film can’t really be described as a cautionary tale (perhaps one in retrospect), but it isn’t without historical, biographical, and educational value, as Nolan explores a comprehensive backstory. Problematically, it just isn’t that entertaining. Designed by Mike Massie | © 2006-2024 Gone With The Twins | All movie related images © their respective owners.

"Jul 19, 2023",Plays like a chain reaction&#44; bouncing between past and present&#44; actions and consequences&#46; This is a blistering piece of filmmaking that&#8217;s only flaws are small shortcomings from its gargantuan ambition&#10;,POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," “But anyone who doesn’t understand that the Manhattan Project is one of the most significant events in human history hasn’t been paying attention. It’s up there with fire and language. It’s at least number three and it may be number one. We just don’t know yet. But we will.” Needless to say McCarthy was not the first person who posited this idea, nor with––some eight months later––the release of Oppenheimer is he the last. It’s also needless to say Christopher Nolan has not reached for McCarthy-like horror. If it’s perhaps a too-high bar we might instead start at his previous engagements with nuclear annihilation: 1) Batman flying a big, swinging bomb just barely out to sea with nary a mention how he’d survive such close-quarters detonation (or what its radiation does to Gotham City’s fish supply) and 2) 150 minutes of portentous gobbledygook whose emotional fulcrum swings here exactly. It’s both impermissive entering this as final evidence of Nolan’s attitude toward the potential for unfathomable suffering and––nevertheless––reason to wonder where, how, why his interests veered towards this of all stories. (Not for nothing that pre-release press has found him, an artist for whom narrative pathos has sometimes suggested obligation before passion, rather hilariously refer to one of the most evil decisions in history as a very complex set of mechanisms. Or just comparing that decision’s progenitor to Batman.) He opts not to convey the Los Alamos operation à la McCarthy’s misery––the silent bus rides to muddy grounds, the exacting and exhausting task of observing the microscopic world, certainly little of the odd sexual dynamics that formed between participants––and the notable disappointment of this always-big, deft-enough, equal-parts compelling and lumbering work is its programmatic portrait of an operation we’re bluntly told changed humankind forever. There’s greater scientific wonder on one page of either novel than in any single passage of Oppenheimer’s process-oriented 180 minutes, a length somehow not up to snuff: time passes so fleetly that news of Hitler’s death is more a reveal that we’re years ahead of any suggested schedule, and only with its thrilling, frightening Trinity Test sequence––admirably closer to Twin Peaks’ Killer Bob origin than archival footage––will the first texture of these efforts even emanate. Yet its immediate aftermath commences Oppenheimer’s great moral oddity, its raison d’être. As quickly as it plays up the familiar tack on America’s bombings (the Soldier Kicking In Every Japanese Door narrative gets noted) does it expose what an awful ruse this was from the moment anyone in Washington suggested the necessity. No surprise for anyone who’s read their Howard Zinn, yes, but there’s a masterstroke in playing this across Cillian Murphy’s face––it stiffens, it curls, it irreversibly turns from fearful wonder at what’s to come towards this sunken-stomach point of no return, it is indisputably this film’s single greatest effect. Hiroshima and Nagasaki beggar belief however often they’re presented, the length and depth of American misdeed burning deeper with each detail conveniently elided by historic narrative or myths of national exceptionalism. It’s safe saying nearly anyone familiar with this material from title on down has at least glimpsed striped clothing singed into Japanese flesh, human shadows forever emblazoned onto walls, an innocent’s eyes burned out and ears melted down, and taking these into account (or just as a gut punch) it’s fairly guessed even one of the few filmmakers given such immeasurable reign had been kindly told IMAX 70mm is a less-than-ideal exhibition space for such. But with respect to any logical process that jettisons their appearance, this of all moments for bombast to subside plays questionable at best; another frame of mind would call it barely half enough, almost a nullifying of the project wholesale. This film’s bait-and-switch, Oppenheimer’s (and Oppenheimer’s) moment of reckoning, might immediately be christened the single greatest sequence Christopher Nolan has ever directed. Chalk this response to experience, the ease with developing certain doubts after spending most of your life knowing his films and noting consistent soft spots or judgmental lapses––his overly expository dialogue, his great insistence on musical bombasity, a too-telegraphed emotional thrum against which his outstanding gifts for pacing, stakes-setting, clockwork plotting mechanics can chafe. It’s the muddying of this exact alchemical tension that briefly, brilliantly blows Oppenheimer off a manicured axis; it’s why I didn’t think Nolan had in him this moment positioned so precisely between horror and awe, a flash of great psychic terror, a momentarily stunning realization of one man’s mind grafting violence and barbarity onto the human race. Had Oppenheimer stopped there (about an hour before its conclusion) its victories would’ve been less contested. Time and again J. Robert Oppenheimer’s intelligence has been contextualized by its speed, and when colleagues didn’t specify it––stories of learning the most-useless language (Dutch) in six weeks to deliver a speech, or reading all of Das Kapital in its original German on a train trip from California to New York––they’d mythologize. It’s this one sequence that ties either end of the spectrum, and it’s Oppenheimer’s great fortune that Cillian Murphy’s interpretation is that instinct packed into a single vessel. This is a performance of admirable precarity: though there’s no parroting of, say, Oppenheimer’s long-ballyhooed capacity to solve questions and equations near-telepathically, it’s Murphy’s eyes which make the suggestion. From early flashbacks to Cambridge he’s a figure of haunted omnipotence––more than aware of his subatomic world (nifty chemical flashes suggesting Nolan has taken some interest in the avant-garde) his Oppenheimer exists at the nexus of multiple narrative timelines, any moment before or hence the grave choice knowing its responsibility for permanent endangerment of humanity. The one consistent brilliance pulsing through Oppenheimer is Murphy’s decision to play him more like tuning fork than man, his emotional arc traced from upright, full-coiffed student to perpetually slumped, close-cropped husk, his reams of dialogue rendered with some hypnotic and unplaceable musicality that suggests the Irishman decided to possess American screen icons of the ‘40s and ‘50s. (Or, okay, this.) Would that this were Oppenheimer’s primary voice. Many others, as is, do the speaking, no aforementioned facts of Oppenheimer’s brilliance go unstated and nary a matter of his personality left unnoted. There’s an honest response that insists this is all thorough, diligent biography because Oppenheimer surely bears such traces, an appreciably indexical work that earns more admiration for letting voluminous research accumulate to ambiguity––safe to say Nolan’s racked up the financial record for a biopic that’d come away with “TBD” on its subject’s character. It’s also mighty stringent on letting that subject live, breathe, exist, be, either making him subject of (and subject to) bullet-point information about himself or withholding key details to service a narrative driven by cross-cutting that is as often bright for its melange (or hodgepodge) of formats, colors, perspectives as it is a bit ungainly in stakes-ratcheting. Though it’d be remiss not noting Robert Downey Jr. is at his most committed since Zodiac––every natural effect of late-50s physicality at forefront, the Tony Stark voice receded with his hairline––those passages are part and parcel of a peculiar overreach drawing parallels between two men who met at another perilous point of American history. What compels (for one thing it’s hard not reading this as a lens on cancel culture) is building from facets of Oppenheimer’s life the film mostly integrates or elucidates elsewhere without ever meeting the tall order of his spark point for humanity’s destruction. (More power to anyone spellbound by his marriage to Emily Blunt.) This said, I will simply never stop thinking about the most guffaw-inducing sex scene in mainstream American cinema and can concede that opportunity alone possibly justifies the entire stretch. The odd, nevertheless compelling paradox of Oppenheimer is that its immersion into manic historic genius suggests a cleaner and preciser portrait would’ve yielded greater dividends, a situation so par for the course with Nolan that it is almost the course entire. The Sturm und Drang perpetually surrounding him––the mystery, the hype, the rakish instinct to choose all-or-nothing sides on a filmmaker with too many complications to render either wise––only has the effect of snuffing consideration, for that matter baseline notice, of how and why his films so thoroughly compel their audiences. Oppenheimer indeed upholds the Nolan operation for running and shooting and playing like a single sustained act––what the champion might call symphonic montage, the cynic an extended trailer. If one’s being too totalizing on the former and ringing needlessly dismissive with the latter, maybe its greatest surprise is that his formulas still provoke surprise. Not that this carnally ascetic filmmaker is willing to at last, my God, attempt a sex scene, but that sex scene; not that this notoriously fastidious storyteller would attempt gestures towards cancel culture, but manage a sufficiently knotty vision; not in seeing a narrative-driven artist try their hand at avant-garde images, but in fact render something of texture, variety, beauty in stops and starts. And if Oppenheimer is not the single finest work Christopher Nolan has ever made, in inspecting it closely enough––perhaps through its subatomic realm of streaked lights and disembodied shapes moving with remarkable patterns––one can imagine its existence somewhere between edits, strewn among the choices shaping, often cohering a film only he would (or could) have created.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Los Alamos, New Mexico: Apache country. Just a half-hour drive from Santa Fe, the land of Los Alamos was sparse but beautiful. The land hosts the most diverse range of flora in the region; the otherwise endless horizon of red dirt is broken by green bushes and vibrant flowers, which itself is broken by the steep mesas that form the rural New Mexico skyline which graces the public imagination through gorgeous mid-century postcards and Western movies. Those Westerns promise that this land was a violent one and that the Apache people, using these mesas as citadel walls, uniquely deserved their violent fate as, according to these movies, they started it. Other films, like Ride the Pink Horse (1947), Hang ‘Em High (1969), or No Country for Old Men (2007), also use violence as a defining feature of this desert, usually as a method of settling scores and balancing sins. After the U.S. Department of War declared eminent domain over this place, they built the ramshackle city of the Manhattan Project on the same natural citadels the Apaches used centuries earlier — for protection and for privacy. They were there to balance sins by wiping the slate clean. Christopher Nolan, perhaps in a flippant mood, described his newest Oppenheimer as a Western, and, in the sense that violence is meted out in a lawless world, it can be. But, unlike a John Ford picture, there are no shots placing the tiny figures in the context of the desert vista; unlike Howard Hawks’ work, there are no moments in which the gigantic cast can relax within the frame, shoot the shit, and otherwise act like a human community before the drama starts. As its title suggests, this film is very much about J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) himself; so his gaunt, sunken face takes center stage, and the land, the houses, other people, all the factors that may influence the “most important man who’s ever lived,” fall into the IMAX camera’s shallow focus. The real Oppenheimer was a product of his environment: he took great interest in the education that was afforded him, learning about contemporary art, philosophy, poetry, literature, history, and living a life of the mind before settling on the scientific version of head-in-the-clouds curiosity that was theoretical physics. He was brought into politics thanks to living in the most politically interesting time in centuries — perhaps ever — and he loved his bit of land in New Mexico. And his legacy of building the bomb only to rabidly denounce future bombs was as much a byproduct of government bureaucracy and wartime determinism as it was the big choices of an important man. In Nolan’s film, these are worth mentioning, perhaps in a list, only to fade into the glassy miasmatic blur around Murphy’s visage avec cigarette. Oppenheimer‘s narrative is framed by two “trials:” the titular character’s security clearance review and the Congressional hearings for Lewis Strauss’ (Robert Downey Jr.) Cabinet nomination. Nearly half the movie takes place in these rooms as Oppenheimer’s character and political leanings are questioned, contested, and defended, allowing Nolan to frame and contextualize each scene or additional character. Flashbacks form the half that isn’t a political thriller, as a college-aged Oppenheimer meets the most famous physicists who ever lived, only to become a star himself at UC Berkeley. He falls for Communism and for Communist women, namely Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), whose name will haunt Robert’s life and the prosecution’s files. But Robert, a Jewish man, recognizes the threat of Hitler as the war rages, and, after a thorough vetting process from General Groves (Matt Damon), channels his political chutzpah into beating the Nazis to nuclear fission. He rallies America’s top scientists — much to the chagrin of military snoops who see Communist Jews in any intellectual activity — into the Manhattan Project, which, headquartered in Oppenheimer’s beloved New Mexico desert, aimed to weaponize the fission process in the form of a bomb, cheerfully termed by Alamosians as “the gadget.” And there, in the land of Acme dynamite and the nation’s first revenge thrillers, they, like the Hebrews in a desert before them, summon the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud. Nolan then, for the final hour, focuses on the two hearings and the political backstabbing that would cement Oppenheimer’s legacy. Though this movie comes with some cinematographic pedigree and bragging rights, boasting both IMAX veteran DP Hoyte van Hoytema and the first ever black-and-white Kodak IMAX film stock, Nolan never uses IMAX for a uniquely IMAX composition. Little of the movie ever strays from Cillian Murphy’s face — even establishing shots are usually wide interior shots populated by a few people, with Murphy never far away. That said, IMAX, despite its reputation for being larger than the largest screens, has a small aspect ratio, sometimes 1.43:1, giving Nolan the opportunity to shoot this like an old Academy ratio Hollywood movie. He’s never interested in landscapes, just a body or two to pose in the frame before an inevitable reverse shot. To give Nolan too much credit, one could see a mirror to one of the best movies about faces and suffering, The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928), where Maria Falconetti’s tears and twinges can speak for themselves. This aspect ratio makes sense for Nolan’s movie, but his IMAX fetishization and an inevitable studio reluctance for conventional 1.37:1 pictures leads to the largest possible version of a rote political thriller. But, even if one accepts that rote political thrillers usually care less about visual appeal and more about images working in favor of the story, Nolan’s script comes up dry. With no-nonsense editing, Nolan cuts from line to line as quickly as possible in order to match the speed of the actors’ performances. No single character seems to have a fleshed-out personality, so each scene devolves into characters finishing each others’ lines in order to give the audience the most information possible, or, as in the sequence where Oppenheimer first meets General Groves, each character matches the previous line with a clever riposte. Every character seems interested in competitive tête-à-têtes or simply getting to the bottom of that day’s shooting script — a result of trying to actually adapt all 700 pages of American Prometheus in three hours. Some of the most dramatic moments even opt for a cartoonish gravitas, such as Oppenheimer’s admittance that “When I was a kid, I thought if I could find a way to mix physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect.” This bit of irony is supposed to spell out the tragedy of Oppenheimer’s career, but it does so loudly and literally. Just like Nolan’s choice to make the “objective” (whatever that means) scenes black-and-white, any potential cleverness in Oppenheimer is ruined by the sophomoric instinct to announce and explain itself. Yet, there are flashes of curiosity and wonder, such as Andrew Jackson’s special effects work that visualizes the abstract, counterintuitive parts of quantum physics. Flashes of erupting particles melt out in one of Oppenheimer’s study sessions while vibrating waves and ripples accompany another, interrupting the more literal flow of interrogation and info-dumping that makes up most of the film. With those images come the ethereal static and sine waves from Ludwig Göransson’s soundtrack, which articulates the strangeness of these revolutionary concepts that somehow describe our world, even if we cannot picture this new world at all. Then, the bomb itself, the centerpiece of the movie, manages to evoke both the horror and beauty that all those at Trinity Site described. The flames bubble out not like the whips of a campfire, but like ink filling a tub of water, hinting at a deadly viscosity that’s tangible, edible like the mesmerizing path of a lava lamp. Nolan opts for a silence here — a welcome respite. Then, after the two cases have been resolved and Oppenheimer’s character has been effectively muddled, the physicist gives us one last dramatic sendoff. Had the movie meditated on the bomb and its consequences, the final sequence could have elicited a frisson comparable to the best of cosmic horror. But since this movie touches on every issue of American Prometheus as fast as it can, it’s easy to forget the grander issues — the kind that a young Oppenheimer concerned himself with — in favor of the more petty squabbles of prosecutors and witnesses. The real story of Oppenheimer (as mentioned in The Day after Trinity [1981]) is the story of Faust, where power and knowledge are granted in exchange for what gives those things value. But Nolan’s Oppenheimer has no Mephistopheles; it has only Prometheus and Vishnu, who, as soon as they’re mentioned, disappear into the pool of shallow focus such that only one god remains.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Attending Cambridge University to study quantum mechanics taught nowhere in America, native New Yorker Julius Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is encouraged by Neils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) to get out of the lab and travel abroad, landing at the University of Göttingen, Germany in 1926. His research leads him to spearheading the theoretical physics program at the University of California, Berkeley, where he dabbled in labor party meetings and consided the astrophysics of stars collapsing into black holes. With a dutiful wife (Emily Blunt), a sometimes mistress (Florence Pugh), and a mandate from Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer directed the creation of a nuclear weapon for the United States, earning him international fame… which he turned into a platform urging nuclear armistice. The revoking of his security clearance as a U.S. Energy Commision advisor crushed Oppenheimer’s spirit and activism, but the sum of the man’s life comes down to a brief conversation with a man named Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). It’s an easy thing to wish Jurassic Park’s Ian Malcolm onto the scientists sequestered at Los Alamos, New Mexico in 1943, or perhaps remind them of the stern warning offered in 1818 by Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, subtitled “The Modern Prometheus.” Writer/director Christopher Nolan turns a biopic spotlight with thriller intent upon J. Robert Oppenheimer, dubbed “The father of the atomic bomb” for organizing the Manhattan Project. What few understood was the worry already in the scientist’s mind about using a weapon of mass destruction, but the fear of any foreign power creating it first drowned out those doubts… until it was too late. In a story told from both an inward and outward point of view, how will audiences judge the scientist, the activist, and the mere mortal who forever changed the world? Big on practical effects and insisting upon creating Trinity atomic test footage without CGI, Nolan builds his tell-all in and around a skewed security clearance renewal, enabling Oppenheimer to recall and recant in-character the details of his life. As an intense three-hour exposé, the story paints a very human version of the man while glossing over some of the details of his anxiety and depression. This delivery vehicle also demands its own closure, such as the conclusion of Lewis Strauss’s Senate conformation hearing (and all the future supporting-actor award nominations later for Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal). Cillian Murphy eerily becomes Oppenheimer; even a casual glance online reveals how exacting the portrayal was with every nuance. Tasked with the impossible, this is the story of a broken man capable of changing the world and the realization his accomplishments would deservedly destroy him.  With so much to tell, three hours doesn’t seem like enough. The story isn’t exactly linear, moving back and forth across the man’s life in recollection from two points of view: Oppenheimer’s “subjective experience” in color (according to Nolan) and another’s outsider view in black and white. These changeovers are effectively done to group certain plot points together, especially between concurrent events outside of the main character’s purview. With a parade of characters and name actors portraying them, one in particular seems under-served: the brief appearances of Pugh’s Jean Tatlock. As a psychiatrist (a detail that wasn’t clear) maintaining a friends-with-benefits relationship with Oppenheimer, the film makes the pairing feel incidental in spite of a moment of paranoia where he imagined her being targeted. It isn’t clear why Oppenheimer’s documented and similar mental health issues were set aside, reducing Tatlock into a plot point of gratuity. Maybe something had to go to keep the runtime under three hours, but it would have been better if it wasn’t this.  There’s a running theme throughout the film: pretty people in pretty rooms deciding the fate of humanity, some out of fear and some to consolidate their own power. A choice was clearly made not to show existing photos of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that followed the actual bombing, substituting Oppenheimer’s imagination of what it could have been like if Los Alamos were the target instead. This effectively counters any false patriotism gleaned from the destruction of up to 226,000 people in Japan as ordered by President Harry S. Truman (ghoulishly portrayed by Gary Oldman) who was only too happy to take full credit. There was no conscientious objection from Oppenheimer when he set to building a nuclear weapon, naively believing its very existence would procure a lasting peace on Earth… instead of igniting a Cold War with Russia and the subsequent Red Scare which was his undoing. In a film featuring brilliant minds, advanced math, and theoretical sciences, Nolan doesn’t expect moviegoers to know the minutiae. The script provides clever and concise examples to move the story along, such as glass bowls filled with marbles as a countdown clock to the first atomic test. To paraphrase Bohr in the film, it’s important to grasp the big picture, to hear the music. To quote Einstein, “I want to know (God’s) thoughts; the rest are just details.” Still, the best description of Oppenheimer may be from the Cyberdyne Systems Model 101 Series 800 Terminator: “It’s in your nature to destroy yourselves.”",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," I am not a formal member of the Church of Nolan, though I do think he is the most consistently ambitious commercial director working today. And I think that’s a good thing. It means we get lots of good movies with scope and ideas and experimentation and not just tentpole, franchise, cookie-cuts.  It also means that his movies sometimes arrive accompanied by Pentecostal-like choirs of critics crawling over one another to see who can be the most effusive in their praise. That can be grating, so when a Nolan film doesn’t live up to the hype (I’m looking at you, Tenet), the blowback can be similarity overblown. My point of comparison here is probably Steven Spielberg around the time of Schindler’s List — Nolan is commercially successful, popular with the masses, and missing only the big prize for his mantle of awards. That being the case, each new film gets judged not so much on its own merits but too often on whether or not this one will be *the* one. And it well could be. Oppenheimer boasts a fabulous script that manages to make complicated scientific, political, and psychological stories accessible to a mainstream audience. It has stellar performances from Cillian Murphy and Rober Downey, Jr., as well as multiple meaty supporting roles.  Even though the plot is built around not one but two hearings, Nolan’s non-linear script keeps it from feeling like a talking-heads documentary. If anything, that non-linear script is a stellar example of form mirroring content as much of the story is about how ideas, decisions, and actions look different at different points in time. Nolan gets cinematic help from Hoyte Van Hoytema, who is probably the best cinematographer not named Roger Deakins working today. Montage editing to convey a mood or idea (as opposed to what is literally happening in the room) is not exactly a new technical innovation, but it is used masterfully here to help keep a three-hour film from bogging down in dialogue. If I have a nit to pick — and this should be no surprise to even Nolan’s fans — it’s in the area of sound design and mixing. The volume of music and sound effects is just on the wrong side of borderline assaultive. I have no doubt that some of this is deliberate, and it is appropriate to the subject matter both in creating anxiety and suspense. But, you know, long periods of painfully loud noise is one form of torture precisely because it can overload the recipient. I suppose one could defend it on the grounds that Oppenheimer is himself unraveling under stressful conditions, but it feels like a blunt instrument in the hands of an otherwise skillful artisan. It is also worth noting here that it can be difficult to assess to what extent sound is a theater problem as opposed to a movie problem. But given how sound mixing is a repeated topic in the reception of Nolan’s films, it is worth mentioning. And since Oppenheimer is a very good movie overall and the type of event film that many people will see regardless of reviews, it leads to my only serious recommendation, which is maybe to avoid IMAX or Dolby on first viewing.  One of the major thematic conflicts in the film is the tension between theory and experimentation. Like so many broad themes, this can be seen as metafictive — it is a similar tension felt by the artist/filmmaker. Knowing the formula for a good movie is something different from actually making a blockbuster or bomb. The moments during the countdown where the genius has spent billions of dollars and yet isn’t positive if the end result will work is also a rough parallel of movie-making.  Of course, the consequences of a movie succeeding or failing may not save the world or destroy it, but as Oppenheimer so deftly illustrates, even the power of atomic energy to save or ruin the world may be largely dependent on the narratives we build around and about it. So maybe the crafting of the narrative — the advancing of a theory about what history means — is as important a contribution to our social and political progress as the artifacts that the narratives are about.",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," It was days before the U.S. dropped a pair of replica atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to a shatteringly devastating aftermath that brought a definitive end to WWII while claiming hundreds of thousands of human lives and launching a nuclear arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. (Those blasts, Nolan smartly and responsibly doesn’t try to recreate.) The quiet doesn’t last of course. A deafening cacophony of blinding lights, fiery particles and explosive thuds follow the mushroom cloud with the cheers of scientists and officials, as if they’d just managed to bring Tom Hanks and the rest of the Apollo 13 astronauts back to earth. Or they just broke the code of the Nazis’ super-secret “Enigma” machine, like in “The Imitation Game.” Simply put, the scene is uncomfortably perfect because it’s founded on polar opposites, like the antitheses at the core of Oppenheimer the man, perennially harboring various moral and intellectual dilemmas, including during this very moment. With a pair of mournful eyes, an astounding Cillian Murphy wears these paradoxes on his face in the eponymous role, like the earned, subtle wrinkles etched on his concerned visage that Nolan and DP Hoyte van Hoytema gloriously capture on IMAX in intimate detail, generally uncharacteristic of this wide format. Is the explosion an unparalleled scientific achievement?  Yes, if you are first and foremost a theorist who wouldn’t hesitate to push the button, like Oppenheimer frequently identifies as throughout the film. Is it also something humankind should have never realized? Also yes, from this technologically more advanced side of history, currently questioning its achievements in the field of AI. You know how the quote goes: “Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should.” Except, Murphy’s Oppenheimer thinks about it, and the possible end he might bring often, so often in fact that he sees visions in his head all day; visions of particles, explosions, burning and perishing humans that Nolan and his VFX team bring to life with alarming frequency and bone-chilling finesse that stuns on the big screen in 70mm. Oppenheimer is a man frightened yet possessed: on the one hand, doing his job like the brilliant scientist he is, with the sole goal of creating a superlative weapon against Hitler. And on the other, constantly questioning the cataclysmic results of his invention that would one day put the reluctant pioneer on the cover of TIME. Based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” Nolan’s film revolves around procedural scenes of smart men in rooms, talking. Think a little “Darkest Hour,” a little “JFK” and a whole lot of Nolan’s archetypal gloomy leading men from the likes of “Dark Knight,” “Interstellar” and “Inception,” and you’ll find yourself in the vicinity of “Oppenheimer.” The film operates in Nolan’s signature non-linear fashion on different timelines, elegantly edited by Jennifer Lame.  There is of course the timeline that leads up to the making of the bomb, featuring a brisk Matt Damon portraying Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves, the terrific chameleon Bennie Safdie as theoretical physicist Edward Teller and Josh Hartnett as nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence, among others. A related timeline involves Oppenheimer’s McCarthy-era security clearance hearing in 1954, through a committee led by an aptly conceited Jason Clarke’s special counsel Roger Robb. Elsewhere, we get one of Robert Downey Jr.’s career-best performances as Admiral Lewis Strauss, whose much publicized 1959 Senate confirmation hearing and complex relationship to Oppenheimer lends the film some of its finest scenes. (To differentiate Strauss’ perspective, Nolan and Hoytema artistically film these scenes in grainy black-and-white.) There are also women in the picture—one, played by an underutilized yet hypnotizing Florence Pugh in the role of the free-spirited psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, who has an ill-fated but steamy romantic affair with Oppenheimer.  The other is a subtly scene-stealing Emily Blunt in the role of Oppenheimer’s unconventional wife Kitty. Once a Bay Area socialite who later refuses to be bogged down by her new domestic role in Los Alamos, Blunt’s Kitty single-handedly runs away with perhaps the most memorable security clearance hearing scene in the movie. Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, David Krumholtz, Alden Ehrenreich, Kenneth Branagh and more lend notability to their parts, but the film ping-pongs so fast and relentlessly amid these interlocking timelines that you are unlikely to follow all the moving pieces, dialogue and details as they bounce around. But even when you wish for some slowdown, you won’t exactly be lost either, thanks to Nolan’s sure-handed structural orchestration that confidently leads the dance and the rhythm of Lame’s proficient cutting.  What you will piece together during the first viewing—including marvelous grace notes such as Oppenheimer’s taste for syrup-dipped cocktail glasses—will be enough to keep you glued to the action. It might even bring you back for a second (or third) dip into Nolan’s interrogation of Oppenheimer’s multifaceted legacy as a restless man of science, Jewish identity and burdened conscience, who, in his brother’s words, sees beyond the world that we live in. The one that Nolan puts him in is created in undeniable lushness, from the Western-like vistas of Los Alamos, New Mexico—a place Oppenheimer’s in love with, imagined by production designer Ruth De Jong—to the impeccable suits and artfully curved hats (by costume designer Ellen Mirojnick) that Oppenheimer presents himself in. Sometimes the picture leaves you craving more quiet moments that would have elevated the procedural machinations and chamber dialogue exchanges, without attacking the senses.  But it’s also bound to deposit feelings of profound awe, sorrow and cinematic joy into the viewers, especially on the heels of Nolan’s devastating conclusion. After all, how often do our cinema outings to major original works feel this big, this full of ideas, this much grounded on ambiguous morals and challengingly imperfect heroes these days? How often do they make us wonder whether our contemporary leaders and decision-makers are as humbly self-questioning as they should be? With immense, cautionary queries about the past and into the future on its mind, “Oppenheimer” has it all in that regard, detonating on countless visual and philosophical cylinders we come to the movies for.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Summer is typically a time for some of America’s most jingoistic entertainment. From Independence Day to  Top Gun: Maverick, the sweltering season is often a moment for uncritical tribute to the Stars and Stripes. Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s latest, is not that. A biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist and father of the atomic bomb—played here with a mixture of bravado and regret by Cillian Murphy—Nolan’s film grapples with two of the greatest atrocities committed by the US: The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Even beyond this summertime reckoning with state-sponsored mass murder, Nolan has made a work of art that interrogates loyalty to country and how it can collide with ego with disastrous results. This is dense material that’s thoroughly engrossing and by its end, shattering.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," It won’t surprise you to know that the most remarkable sequence in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is the one depicting the Trinity Test – the first detonation of a nuclear bomb, in the heart of the New Mexico desert in 1945. Nolan allows the explosion to unfold in absolute, deafening silence for what feels like hours, tears forming on the faces of observers and the IMAX screen filling with flames and smoke. Not many new movies can match a moment like this.
 Then, the sound hits. Or rather, the noise. It slams into your chest with a thud. The weight of this world-changing moment hits with a wallop, as one of the best directors working today unleashes the power of 21st century technology to depict the peak of 1940s scientific innovation. It’s special stuff.
 And in some ways, that’s why Oppenheimer is so utterly frustrating. It contains one of the most incredible set pieces committed to celluloid – and Christopher Nolan is an utter devotee of shooting on film – but it’s also capable of being a muddled biopic that doesn’t feel even close to the definitive take on this controversial American hero.
 Let’s start with what’s clear: Cillian Murphy is exceptional in the title role. It’s a performance of real complexity, with Murphy marrying unyielding calm and stillness with a strange, serpentine charisma. His J. Robert Oppenheimer is equally believable as both hero and villain, emerging as a mercurial figure with eyes so blue and probing that they could knock out a basilisk at ten paces. If there’s any justice, he’ll be very busy on red carpets in February and March next year.
 As for the surrounding players, it’s a bit of a thankless battle. The Oppenheimer cast is a stacked ensemble, with Nolan amassing a Wes Anderson-esque quantity of A-listers to pop in and play very famous scientists – Kenneth Branagh as a strange, Herzogian spin on Niels Bohr; Jack Quaid bizarrely near-wordless as Richard Feynman. Nobody really gets a chance to make an impression, with Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt particularly under-served as the two women in Oppenheimer’s life.
 Initially, this is a fleet-footed and pacey biopic, blasting through Oppenheimer’s early life in a whirlwind of hazy Communist Party meetings and academic campaigning. This stuff will be important to Oppenheimer’s downfall later, but unfortunately there simply isn’t time for much in the way of groundwork.
 Then the arrival of Matt Damon as Manhattan project director General Groves powers the movie into its strongest segment, depicting the rapid innovation and panicked urgency of the Los Alamos laboratory. There’s a real energy to these sequences, building inexorably towards the intermingled horror and awe of Trinity.
 Nolan ratchets the tension up almost unbearably with the help of Ludwig Göransson’s insistent score, which ingeniously introduces the evocative crackle of a Geiger counter as the test draws nearer. When the movie says goodbye to Los Alamos, it leaves Oppenheimer under a cloud of uncertainty, as he begins to wrangle with the enormity of what his creation has done – aided by a truly horrifying vision involving Christopher Nolan’s daughter.
 Once the dust settles, it’s Robert Downey Jr. who gets the most to do other than Murphy, as the slippery politician Lewis Strauss. His perspective on his interactions with Oppenheimer forms the monochrome secondary timeline of the movie, set amid the 1959 hearings surrounding Strauss’s Secretary of Commerce nomination.
 In the wake of the gargantuan stakes of everything happening at Los Alamos, it feels strange for the movie to then switch focus into a multi-stranded courtroom drama, split between Strauss’s nomination hearing and Oppenheimer’s grilling over his security clearance.
 These scenes have a tendency to veer into shouty melodrama – as Göransson’s score joins the chorus of yelling – which feels at odds with the careful control of the first half.
 There’s a world in which this stuff would’ve worked, and there’s definitely something to be said about the chaos around the atomic arms race after the war. But the result is a lost focus on the idea of the man behind the bomb, who pursued science out of passion and became a “destroyer of worlds” – as he himself so famously said – with blood on his hands in the process.
 The movie makes a noble attempt to wrangle the story of the atomic bomb and the complex political leanings of Oppenheimer into a coherent package, but the result is something that can often feel muddy. This is a three-hour epic that somehow stills feels as if too many stones have been left unturned in exploring the actual human being behind the story. When Damon’s character says Oppenheimer “knows more about science than people”, he could be speaking about his director.
 It feels perverse to give a three-star review to Oppenheimer (Editor’s note: Three stars is a recommendation), because this is anything but a middling film. It’s a muscular and delightfully old-fashioned biopic – augmented with the most cutting-edge filmmaking – that, at its best, stands among the best movies of Nolan’s career.
 But sadly, the movie is as maddening and mercurial as Oppenheimer himself, struggling to distill the protagonist’s tangled, complicated life into just a few hours. In some ways, it’s fitting that such a difficult man has inspired such a difficult film. There’s genius at its heart, but it sometimes gets lost in the smoke.

"Jul 19, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn’t exist. For a film clocking in at almost exactly three hours, it’s initially troubling when Oppenheimer opens with some of Christopher Nolan’s most confounding storytelling devices since his last film, Tenet. Janky pacing, elaborate yet robotic dialogue, seemingly whimsical lens filters with no immediate rhyme or reason, and a frenetic attention to detail that has you wondering if we really needed the sound of liquid hitting a cup to be amped up this many decibels and for what purpose besides 70mm IMAX aesthetic derring-do? Yet there’s probably no other way for a modern film to somewhat accurately reflect the bombastic inner turmoil of brilliance hampered by morality. And by the film’s end, you’ll doubt Oppenheimer could’ve been this good as anything else but what it is. Cillian Murphy doesn’t just play J. Robert Oppenheimer, the real-life “Father of the Atomic Bomb,” he fully inhabits the man for all he’s worth, which is quite a lot. Murphy has had years of fun over the last decade on screens big and small, capitalizing on his inherently compelling charm mixed with snide cynicism. But here he is no scarecrow or privileged brat. Well, maybe he’s a little of both. As some in the film describe him, he’s a womanizing Communist sympathizer whose adept hand at bringing quantum physics to America has earned him enough prestige to skate by as the director of Los Alamos, an extension of the Manhattan Project aimed at developing an atomic bomb during WWII before the Nazis get there first. At one point during Oppenheimer, you might wonder if even you’re in this movie as well. The ensemble cast is as expansive as the runtime, boasting Matt Damon as the general who spars with Oppenheimer over the logistics of the project. Florence Pugh is his Communist paramour aiming to reignite an affair outside the gaze of Emily Blunt as his wife. The film often flashes backward and forward in time, usually recounting the aftermath of Los Alamos with Robert Downey Jr. as a scheming politician trying to make sense of Oppenheimer’s legacy alongside his aide, Alden Ehrenreich.  The scientists brought into the project include many familiar faces — Benny Safdie, Olivia Thirlby, Josh Peck, and Jack Quaid, to name a few — with Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Jason Clarke taking up even more space throughout. It’s a wonder a biographical movie with so many dynamic actors flowing in and out of frame can still be so thoroughly devoted to the exact nature of a single, yet momentous man. Though this is where Oppenheimer loses touch with its own genius. The ambiguity of Oppenheimer’s actions both before, during, and after Los Alamos is likely its most compelling appeal as a story, in this case adapted from his actual 2005 biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Because this is a visual medium, however, his inherent mystique gives way to a jarring moral clarity that contradicts the stance the man tried to martyr himself for in the wake of the Cold War. That is, the silent war between unrelenting American patriotism and a commitment to the protection of free speech and dissent. While the film can be cathartic in its heroic grandstanding toward the latter, it loses some of its ability to preach its important message more effectively. But at the very least, Nolan — who both wrote and directed the film — saves his best tricks for the second half. In his fourth collaboration with cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who most recently worked on last year’s Nope, Nolan eschews most of his worst tendencies in Tenet and evolves the playful techniques he experimented with in Dunkirk. Namely a spinning of time and place using cinematic language, such as various black-and-white shades to tell more about perspective, mood, and morality itself than the exact time and place. During the development of the bomb, the world is colorful. It’s varied, vibrant, and full of potential. Later on it is cold, calculating, and merciless, with the exception of certain deposition scenes using color to showcase Oppenheimer’s resolve in the face of new threats. Not everything flows gracefully, however, particularly the erratic shifting of aspect ratio, which IMAX viewers will probably find the most glaring. But these imperfections are easy to forgive when Nolan punctuates his second act, for example, with an unforgettable “victory speech” that uses the mere presence of sound and suggestion (aided by Ludwig Göransson’s incredible score) to put us squarely in the shoes of a man in absolute crisis. Despite its exhaustive length, Oppenheimer moves so quickly and with so much confidence, it manages to just barely avoid being too tiresome to appreciate. To the point where it’s actually easy to yearn for maybe just a little more attention to the science of what they’re doing, shown more practically and with tactile impact. The film does this in spurts, to be fair, but by the time the bomb itself becomes the reality we already know, almost all of the logistical obstacles have disappeared while the film focused us on all the emotional drama and future-politicking. Still, Oppenheimer is a return to form that Nolan desperately needed, and perhaps we needed as well. Because it proves that blockbusters can still be the bomb, without being nothing but box office bombs. Jon is one of the co-founders of InBetweenDrafts and our resident film editor.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s elegant, majestic “Oppenheimer” is three hours long, and you feel every minute of that running time even as it flies by. What Nolan’s after here isn’t just to thrill us — though he does that, with parts of the film tick-tocking like a great heist sequence — but to immerse us in the life, work and troubling legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), a slight, pale-eyed man who held the future of the earth in his hands. Oppenheimer (1904-1967) was a theoretical physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb. During World War II, he led a team at the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico tasked with creating the first nuclear weapons; after the bomb was successfully tested in July 1945, it was deployed a month later on Japan’s Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing a staggering number of citizens. (Estimates vary; some give the toll as 200,000 or more.) Nolan’s film moves us back and forth in time, from Oppenheimer’s early days in academia to the breathless work at Los Alamos to a later series of hearings, held in a cramped conference room, in which Oppenheimer’s past associations with Communists threatened his security clearance and his future. It’s an ambitious setting for a film — particularly one aimed at nonscientists who may not be entirely clear on the finer points of quantum mechanics — but that’s standard for Nolan, that rare big-studio filmmaker who wants us thinking even as we munch our popcorn. In “Oppenheimer,” he presents us with a complicated hero, a brilliant man who seems to turn into a ghost before our eyes, whittled down by years and by qualms (“terrible ones,” he says) about what he has unleashed. And he gives the storytelling a twist, letting the story unfold both in quietly restrained color (the sequences featuring Oppenheimer), and in stark black-and-white, the latter featuring Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission whose relationship with Oppenheimer grew complex. As always with a Nolan movie, the look of the film is impeccable. Filmed (on large-format film stock) by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and designed by Ruth de Jong (production) and Ellen Mirojnick (costumes), “Oppenheimer” is crisply beautiful, blooming with unexpected moments of color like the green of an apple, the red of a woman’s lipstick, the orange of a sudden pillar of fire. You don’t expect this kind of elegance in a film that’s mostly about men in ties gathering in rooms to discuss calculations, but that’s what Nolan gives us; one shot, with Oppenheimer in his straight-brimmed hat standing on the newly built main street of Los Alamos (a remote town created for the sole purpose of housing research), seems like it’s from a great Western, with a hero uncomfortably aware that high noon is coming too soon. Murphy’s eerily handsome face, made up of angles and shadows and eyes that always seem to be telling a story that’s different from the one he’s speaking, is the film’s foundation, and his layered performance is its anchor. An unrecognizable Downey brings his trademark naturalness to Strauss’s struggles, and Matt Damon clicks beautifully with Murphy as no-nonsense general Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. Emily Blunt, with little screen time, brings intriguing complexity to the role of Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty. (This is a familiar pitfall with Great Man movies: You either make the wife a sweetly uncomplicated helpmate, or you make her a person and shortchange her story. I’d watch an entire movie about the ups and downs of the Oppenheimer marriage, most of which is just hinted at here — and Blunt, to her great credit, occasionally makes us regret that this isn’t that movie.) With Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, based on the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. 180 minutes. Rated R for some sexuality, nudity and language. Opens July 20 at multiple theaters.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," I still marvel (word chosen deliberately) at the  hype surrounding a biopic about the scientist largely responsible for atomic weapons. And not from awards-hounds, either. Blockbuster fans. That is, of course, mostly down to its writer-director, Christopher Nolan.  Nolan’s penchant for dizzying narrative structure, enormous visuals, and heart-pounding tension have made him one of Hollywood’s biggest directors. After 2017’s Dunkirk proved his style could apply to historical epics just as well as genre fare, the cinema community couldn’t be more excited for Oppenheimer. And once you start to vibe with its chaotic approach to the material, it really is a wonderful, troubling film. You should absolutely not expect Oppenheimer to follow typical biopic structure, pacing, or even character introduction. This is a lengthy movie with loads of moving parts. Characters come in and out of the orbit of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, masterfully underplayed by Cillian Murphy. With a few exceptions where the people involved are names you know—Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr—Nolan relies on casting familiar faces and giving them just enough screen time to know they’re important when they pop up much later. Not content to present anything in full chronological order, Oppenheimer gives us two frame stories. Each presents a different point of view on times in the man’s life and career. The first, dubbed “Fission,” shows us the controversial 1954 hearing which sought to revoke Oppenheimer’s security clearance based on his perceived history as a communist sympathizer. The second, “Fusion,” is the Senate confirmation hearing for Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Strauss had appointed Oppenheimer to the Atomic Energy Commission a few years after WWII. Fission is in color, Fusion in black and white. All the while, we see parts of Oppenheimer’s rise to theoretical quantum physics messiah and his eventually founding and leading of the Los Alamos site development of the atomic bomb which eventually leveled Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The movie is long, and it covers a lot of ground, quite quickly. The music and sound design keep us from ever feeling at ease. Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography wavers between huge closeups and massive landscapes, hammering home the micro and the macro of the story at hand. Oppenheimer struggles with his place in history. The movie doesn’t let him off the hook, either. He is both the genius whose tenacity helped end WWII and “become death, destroyer of worlds.” It puts me in mind, in a completely different tone and style, of Hayao Miyazaki’s previous final film, 2013’s The Wind Rises. That film followed the aeronautics genius who wanted to make airplanes, and did so to create the A6M Zero fighter during WWII. Scientists creating and discovering while knowing their work will kill loads of people. Oppenheimer also contends with the end of an all-too-brief time when scientists and experts were trusted and listened to not just for technological advancement but for policy and morality. As often happens, however, when the people in power see more power on the horizon, they turn their back on reason. The entire project was in Oppenheimer’s hands, the movie details, only for it to be stripped away by the military, the US government, and eventually the nuclear age the moment it was finished. Just like the Space Race was all about beating the Soviets to the moon, the rise of the A-bomb was all to stick it to the Nazis, who had already surrendered by time the bombs dropped. Not everything about the movie works. While the movie tries to make Oppenheimer’s romantic and sexual relationships—the man was a notorious womanizer—have weight, they end up as nudity-filled footnotes. Emily Blunt plays Robert’s wife Kitty, who gets a good amount to do, but Florence Pugh as his troubled communist girlfriend seems only there for awkward sex scenes. We see next to nothing about any other woman in the story, save Olivia Thirlby as one of the Los Alamos project’s lone female physicists. She doesn’t have a ton of screen time, but she’s there. Oppenheimer certainly feels like several movies, but it’s to Nolan’s credit that each works as well as it does. The breathlessness waiting for the Trinity bomb test, even knowing it didn’t, in fact, end the world, is one of the movie’s crowning achievements. But equal tension comes from Oppenheimer realizing what he hath wrought. It’s an amazing feat, making a single event seem both like a triumph and a failure. This movie pulls it off. Like its central figure, Oppenheimer is a complicated, hectic, but altogether satisfying movie that will give people much to think about. I could list all the performances that merit attention, but that would end up just looking like a cast list. Murphy’s grounded, stoic, heavy performance as one of the most complex figures of the 20th century should, and likely will, receive plaudits. Richly deserved. The movie entirely rests on him, and it’s a career highlight in an already excellent body of work. If this is the film that will give Murphy and Nolan their first Academy Awards, it will be well and truly warranted.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," By  Charles Pulliam-Moore, a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years. Out of all this summer’s blockbusters that have had film buffs chomping at the bit, few (really just one, actually) have elicited hype as visceral and sustained as Universal’s Oppenheimer biopic from director Christopher Nolan. With its sizable fleet of A-listers doing mid-20th-century accent work, a complicated historical figure at its center, and a respected auteur steering the ship, Oppenheimer has all the making of a summer blockbuster destined to continue dominating this year’s film discourse for months to come.  But for all of its explosive moments of grandeur and unsurprisingly powerful individual performances, Oppenheimer, as a whole, plays like a chaotic assortment of frantic vignettes coming from a storyteller who’s far too focused on the performance of sage profundity rather than sussing out the real thing. Inspired by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s seminal 2005 Oppenheimer biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer is an account of the events that led to its eponymous theoretical physicist becoming one of the most lauded, hated, and infamous men in human history for his role in developing the atomic bomb. Oppenheimer commits most of its energy to chronicling the US’s race to develop nuclear weapons during World War II and the subsequent political fallout Oppenheimer weathered afterward as he began to advocate for nuclear nonproliferation.  Like American Prometheus, though, Nolan’s new film also understands the importance of illustrating what kind of idiosyncratic, sexually frustrated, and politically engaged person Oppenheimer was in his pre-fame days — a time when he was still learning just how much of an influence he and his intellect could have over others. Long before he was being grilled by the Gray Board, gracing the covers of Time magazine, or directing the Manhattan Project laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) was an exceedingly brilliant but profoundly awkward young man looking for meaning in the arts and sciences. Equal parts ensemble drama and stealth thriller, Oppenheimer frames its famed subject as a kind of human catalyst who — both in spite and because of his eccentric mind — innately radiates a kind of animating energy that compels most everyone around him into various kinds of action. It’s that energy that first pulls people like acerbic botanist and high-functioning alcoholic Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt) — Oppenheimer’s eventual wife — and depressive psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) — his eventual longtime mistress — into his orbit. That energy’s also what makes so many of his peers gravitate toward him during his years coming up through academia and an important part of what puts him on the radar of Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) as he begins building the brain trust destined to power the Manhattan Project. But there’s a chaos to its overall narrative structure that makes the film play like an assortment of overengineered individual scenes that only coalesce into something concrete occasionally before the movie shifts its focus and attempts to repeat the process to varying degrees of success.  At the same time the movie’s trying to illustrate how Oppenheimer’s left-wing political sensibilities and youthful experiences with labor organization informed his adult worldview, it’s also digging into his love life and the professional jealousies of Oppenheimer’s peers that made him both a threat and someone to look up to. All of that is deeply important context for the film’s quick-fire scenes set during the mid-’50s as United States Atomic Energy Commission commissioner Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) heads up hearings designed to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance and deeply discredit him in the public eye.  But Oppenheimer is so prone to bouncing around from one brief, intense, overly patter-filled scene to another that it often feels like Nolan might have simply shot far, far too much footage and then ultimately cherry-picked the moments that felt impactful to him rather than the ones necessary to set off a narrative chain reaction resulting in a cohesive movie. This is especially unfortunate because, by and large, many of Oppenheimer’s actors — Blunt, Damon, and Murphy, in particular — are delivering truly fantastic, studied performances that speak to the humanity and complexity of their characters. Both Rami Malek and Alden Ehrenreich are tremendous as Los Alamos physicist David Hill and an unnamed Senate aide, respectively, and Dane DeHaan is downright chilling as Army officer Kenneth Nichols. But because of Oppenheimer’s structure, almost none of these performances really have enough time to take up the space they deserve, and just when you’ve gotten a chance to become comfortable and fully engaged with them, the movie’s already moved on. Though composer Ludwig Göransson’s score is often beautiful, rather than flowing throughout the film consistently in time with its emotional beats, it fades in and out much like the movie’s vignettes frequently fade to black, and it tends to emphasize how disjointed they feel. But Oppenheimer’s sound — that is to say, its sound design — is arguably the most interesting (though not always well-executed) aspect of the film and what most moviegoers are going to end up being blown away by, in multiple senses of the phrase. For obvious reasons, there are more than a few explosions that punctuate Oppenheimer’s three-hour runtime. But instead of fixating solely on the visual spectacle of towering infernos designed to mutilate and massacre, Nolan instead tries to use sound to make you feel a fraction of the devastation Oppenheimer became famous for. Though this approach works well when the movie’s depicting explosions, it truly begins to shine later on in the film after the atomic bombs have been dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and Oppenheimer — surrounded by fellow Americans drunk on the idea of American exceptionalism — can’t help but marvel in horror at the idea of what his life’s work has culminated in. It’s in moments like those — when Oppenheimer’s directly addressing the reality of the US’s decisions made as WWII was coming to an end rather than mythologizing the men behind those decisions — that the movie’s at its absolute best. But ultimately, those moments are so few and far between that Oppenheimer always feels like an assortment of great filmmaking ideas being hamstrung by their haphazard execution. Oppenheimer also stars Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, Dylan Arnold, Gustaf Skarsgård, Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchian, Tom Conti, Michael Angarano, Jack Quaid, Olivia Thirlby, Tony Goldwyn, Emma Dumont, and Gary Oldman.

"Jul 19, 2023"," This review was published during the historic SAG-AFTRA and WGA strikes. People’s World acknowledges that film and television would not be possible without the workers who make it happen. We stand in solidarity with the strike and the workers. The existence of a film like Oppenheimer shows just how necessary it is to teach history in all of its complexities and nuance. When tackled in a way that is not sanitized, it can open up a true exploration of our past and its influence on our present and future. This biopic explores the life of the “father of the atomic bomb,” Julius Robert Oppenheimer, portrayed on screen by Cillian Murphy. The film masterfully creates an engrossing and dramatic thriller that intertwines history and questions of morality. It takes a deep dive into the Atomic Age of the 1940s and forces viewers to grapple with questions of how the period forever changed the course of human history. It is a heavy three hours to sit through, but well worth the viewing. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan (Dunkirk), Oppenheimer is based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus, by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. The film tells the story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, thereby ushering in what has been called the Atomic Age. The Atomic Age began when the first nuclear bomb—called “The Gadget”—was tested in New Mexico, on July 16, 1945, during World War II. The bomb’s success would lead to the atomic annihilation of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki near the end of the war. It represented the first large-scale use of nuclear technology and brought about immense changes and divisions regarding technological development. Oppenheimer played a pivotal role in launching this era. His scientific genius and organization of the Manhattan Project brought about one of the most influential scientific breakthroughs known to humankind. This breakthrough, of course, was a double-edged sword, as the theoretical scientist had to deal with the fallout (literally and figuratively), the lives lost, and the potentially catastrophic future his bomb could bring. The film explores Oppenheimer grappling with this moral dilemma, the atmosphere that brought about his conviction to create the bomb, his misgivings after the bomb came to fruition, and the influential figures around him that helped in his rise, fall, and eventual rise again in the public eye. What the film also makes plain is that politics cannot be separated from how science and innovation are used to either help or hinder humanity. Director Nolan doesn’t shy away from the politics that shaped Oppenheimer’s life and those closest to him. Like many in the 1930s who were radicalized by the hardships of the Great Depression and the global rise of fascism, Oppenheimer was an individual who leaned heavily towards left-wing political thinking. His lifelong best friend was a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA); his brother Frank was a former member of the party; one of his first great loves, Jean Tatlock, was a member of the CPUSA; and his eventual wife and the mother of his children—Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer—was also an activist and former member of the CPUSA. For a good chunk of Oppenheimer’s life, he donated to a number of causes that would soon be deemed “radical,” “socialist,” and “communist.” By his own account, he subscribed to People’s World and was “quite close to the Communist Party,” though he never officially joined. It is essential to understand the socio-political context of Oppenheimer’s life in order to grasp the treatment and red-baiting he endured as he began speaking up against the U.S. government’s use of science and innovation to fuel war and militarism. Due to the intertwining topics and themes, Nolan goes the route of not telling Oppenheimer’s story in a linear way. The focus is on three key points in history for the scientist. The first is his early days leading up to being recruited for the Manhattan Project and his time working on it. This is where the audience gets a glimpse into his psyche and the scientific, political, and personal factors that influenced him.  We see his connections with labor organizers attempting to unionize the professors and staff at UC Berkeley. We also learn that the FBI, under J. Edgar Hoover, had begun surveilling Oppenheimer even before WWII. The second segment is centered on the panel hearing he endured in 1954 that led to his government security clearance being revoked. This is perhaps the heart of the film, as we see Oppenheimer grappling most with his legacy and his role in the creation of such a powerful weapon. This is the hearing that brought about his “downfall,” the moment when his “loyalty” to the government was questioned due to his past political affiliations and his opposition to certain projects the government was pushing—like the catastrophic hydrogen bomb. The third key point follows Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss (played to perfection by Robert Downey, Jr.) years after Oppenheimer’s clearance was revoked. Strauss had played a central role in stripping Oppenheimer of his clearance. The portion of the film is set during Strauss’ Senate confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Commerce under then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower. This may seem like a random point for some not familiar with Strauss’ frenemy relationship with Oppenheimer, but it plays a pivotal role in driving home the fact that although Oppenheimer was a crucial ingredient for many scientific advances in his era, he—along with characters like Strauss—were also puzzle pieces in a larger political picture. Strauss had been chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, advocated for the hydrogen bomb, and minimized the impact of radiation fallout on Pacific Islanders affected by U.S. nuclear tests. This all may seem like a lot for a film to take on, but it works. Nolan embraces the complexities of his main character and all the supporting characters around him. It is this embrace of complexity and nuance that lends itself to not shoving anything into a particular box, but rather allowing the audience to make the connections and form their own conclusions. Murphy helps bring it all together in an inspired yet reserved performance. Other characters who stand out in their own right are Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty (played by Emily Blunt) and the scientist’s former girlfriend, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Blunt gives a chilling performance as the loyal and somewhat troubled wife; it is this critic’s hope that the film encourages viewers to look deeper into Kitty’s life to understand her history in the progressive movement even before she met her husband. Hers is an interesting tale that Nolan touches upon briefly, but it helps viewers grasp the character’s choices and attitudes which those unfamiliar with her past may initially find perplexing. Pugh’s Tatlock makes a lasting impression in the film, although her presence feels all too brief. What the film also explores through its look at Oppenheimer’s life is the use of science and innovation by the government and the volatile dynamic that can result. U.S. government officials knew of Oppenheimer’s ties to left-wing groups and people, yet they understood the importance of his potential contribution. This was true not only for Oppenheimer, as many of his colleagues—a number of whom worked with him during the Manhattan Project—were later blacklisted during the red-baiting witch hunts of the McCarthy era. Oppenheimer was allowed to take on an advisory role in government, but the rapid development of potential world-ending weapons left many in the scientific community conflicted. Working for the government on such projects left them with no real ownership over how their research discoveries were used. Oppenheimer was one of the few allowed to speak out and disagree, even as he continued to advise the government, due to his star power. Yet, his security hearing—where his political affiliations were targeted and his clearance denied—marked a dark day when censorship and oppression won out. Talented people were pushed out of their careers because they dared to question the state and the socio-economic system. The blacklisting happened not only in the scientific field but also in entertainment, medical, and other industries. Who knows what innovations might have been lost to time due to the oppressive McCarthy era? The weight of these blacklistings isn’t lost on director Nolan, either, as he takes moments to acknowledge those around Oppenheimer who were also affected. Once again, there’s a lot here, yet Nolan manages—through dynamic storytelling and highly imaginative directorial choices—to infuse an energy in the film that prevents it from ever feeling like a three-hour slog. That’s pretty impressive when you’ve got to relay the complexities of theoretical physics to audiences who may have never tried to understand the topic before watching the film. Oppenheimer is a must-watch for those who love history—and good storytelling in general. For some not as familiar with the topic, or this era, names are mentioned and references made that might be lost on them. Hopefully, that is taken as a challenge, as opposed to discouragement, to dig further into this influential moment in history. Chauncey K. Robinson is an award winning journalist and film critic.

"Jul 19, 2023"," It opens with a screen that tells us about Prometheus, the Greek god who “stole fire from the gods and gave it to men.” His fellow Olympians weren’t too happy with him, and they sentenced Prometheus to spend eternity in torment, shackled to a volcano. Oppenheimer is based on the book American Prometheus, about Robert J. Oppenheimer, the New York-born theoretical physicist who led America’s Manhattan Project, the top-secret “think tank” that created the atomic bombs dropped in on Nagasaki and Hiroshima in Japan in August 1945. The bombs effectively ended World War II, but also created the grim specter of nuclear war as a reality, one that could—theoretically—lead to the destruction and doom of the entire planet. Director Christopher Nolan’s grandiose, magnum opus of a historical biopic depicts Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) as a tortured, sometimes arrogant genius, wrestling with the wide-reaching global implications of what he’s doing, and later, with what he’s done. Like Prometheus, he harnessed the fire of the cosmos—splitting subatomic particles and unleashing the deadly “fire” power of a thermonuclear device—and was then pilloried for it, with accusations that he was a traitor, a spy, a Commie. It’s a dense drama, powerful and potent, about a loaded moment in time at the intersection of politics, science, discovery, history, human emotion, psychodrama, creation and destruction, chain reactions and ethics, all swirling like protons and neutrons around something no one had ever done, or witnessed, before. It’s a cinch for year-end awards nominations, likely even some Oscars. Yes, it’s that good. The all-star cast is outstanding, with everyone playing someone from real life, from Matt Damon as the hawkish Leslie Groves, the U.S. Air Force general who built the Pentagon and was chosen to oversee Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, to Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife—whose former ties to the Communist Party become a major, troublesome part of her husband’s trajectory from the classroom to the world stage.  Robert Downey Jr. is a major part of the story as Lewis Strauss, head of the Atomic Energy Commission. There’s Florence Pugh, Oppy’s Communist lover, and Casey Affleck as the military intelligence officer who commands the Allied forces during the war.  Matthew Modine plays a scientist doing high-ranking R&D for America’s war machine. Kenneth Branagh is the Danish physicist Niels Bhor, and Tom Conti plays Albert Einstein. But everything hinges on Oppenheimer, the central character in almost every scene. Murphy, an Irish actor who’s also appeared in Batman Begins and Inception, plus the British hit TV series Peaky Blinders, gives a stunning, career-high performance, conveying the inner turmoil, passionate convictions and strong opinions of the man tasked with making a device that would weaponize the science on which he had dedicated his life. Oppenheimer’s bombs ended the fighting and brought peace to a war that had been raging across the globe for six years. But what would be the cost to him, and to the world? Director Nolan (who also wrote the screenplay and produced) is perhaps Hollywood’s leading movie maestro, known for his densely layered, often complex dramas and intense character studies across multiple genres, including a trio of acclaimed Batman blockbusters starring Christian Bale, the mind-bending Inception, Tenet and Memento, the gripping, innovative war drama Dunkirk, and the far-out space-travel drama Interstellar. He knows better than almost anyone how to make blockbusters with brains, and Oppenheimer is queued up to be one of the most intensely brainy, monumentally majestic, stylistically soaring blockbusters of the year. And the “test” of Oppenheimer’s nuclear device, at Los Alamos in the American desert, is as gripping, jaw-droppingly dramatic and visually stunning as almost anything you’ve ever experienced at any movie, ever.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","  Christopher Nolan explores the life, controversial legacy, and significant scientific contributions of J. Robert Oppenheimer in a tense, superbly-acted biopic. Based on the biography American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film chronicles the ""father of the atomic bomb"" through an unvarnished lens.   Oppenheimer is portrayed as an arrogant genius with an extraordinary ability to visualize advanced theoretical concepts. He was revered while being greatly disliked and an unabashed womanizer who harbored leftist political views, but also a diligent taskmaster capable of managing the Manhattan Project, which thrust the world into the nuclear age and the brink of annihilation.   Oppenheimer is told in several concurrent timelines from two points of view. Nolan opens with Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) at the height of the Red Scare in 1954. He's being viciously interrogated by a committee from the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). His security clearance is in danger of being revoked for associations with known communists and possibly Russian espionage. Five years later, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), former chairman of the AEC, and the man who brought Oppenheimer to Princeton after World War II, sits before a Senate panel for confirmation to be President Eisenhower's Secretary of Commerce.   Strauss is asked directly about his work with Oppenheimer and disputed events leading up to the creation of Edward Teller's (Benny Safdie) thermonuclear hydrogen bomb. In 1954, Oppenheimer reads a statement about his start in quantum physics and the people who were instrumental in shaping his career.   Nolan then flashes back to a younger Oppenheimer in the 20s as an eager but frustrated student. He was obsessed with the work of Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) and Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). Oppenheimer believed in the existence of Black Holes. What happens when a supermassive star collapses into itself? A troubled Oppenheimer stares into space but thinks about the gravitational implosion on a subatomic level.   Oppenheimer's first act swings between the hearings and seemingly unreal possibilities. He vividly imagines particles in the quantum realm. Nolan uses visual effects to show the audience this chaotic state. He then begins a primer through character dialogue to explain the basic theories of quantum mechanics. This is vital exposition that smartly doesn't get too detailed. You learn just enough to understand what makes an atomic reaction go boom.   The second act dives deep into Oppenheimer's complex and sordid personal life. Many intellectuals in the '20s and '30s flirted with communist ideologies. Oppenheimer is introduced to people whose friendships would haunt and cost him dearly in the future. He becomes enamored with the sharp and sultry Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). The devout communist intrigues Oppenheimer with her intellect and voracious sexual appetite. Cillian Murphy acts his heart out in the more emotional scenes with Pugh, which make for a meaningful contrast to his more cerebral performance elsewhere.   He also discovers his lifelong love for New Mexico. Nolan shifts cinematic focus to sweeping, spectacular shots of the desert landscape. Oppenheimer's purchase of a ranch with his younger brother, Frank (Dylan Arnold), a registered communist, would become key to developing America's top secret nuclear research facility.   The onset of World War II raises the stakes. Oppenheimer, and the country's leading scientific minds, knew the Nazis were pursuing a nuclear fission weapon. A bomb of this magnitude had catastrophic range and aftermath. Nolan introduces General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the no-nonsense and tough engineer who designed the Pentagon. He's given a blank check and supreme authority by the President to beat the Germans to the atomic bomb at all costs. Groves was keenly aware of Oppenheimer's reputation. He'd been closely watched by the FBI as his communist leanings were well known.   Oppenheimer's three-hour runtime is a masterclass in ensemble acting, character development, and film editing. Cinephiles and Nolan worshipers are going to be absolutely entranced with its dense plotting and stunning artistry. That said, audiences should be aware this is not a blockbuster action film in any sense. Those expecting to see epic IMAX and 70mm nuclear explosions are going to be bitterly disappointed. There's no Terminator-esque scenes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki being blown to bits. The entire first half of the film leads up to the Trinity test. It's freaking incredible but the only big bang you'll see here. Nolan isn't James Cameron in his approach to depicting apocalyptic doom.   Oppenheimer can be likened to a courtroom drama. The Strauss hearings, and any of his recollections, are depicted in black and white for reasons revealed in the climax. Oppenheimer's perspective is always in color. He thought outside the box and is seen as incredibly sophisticated. Nolan wages a kind of submarine warfare. He never shows the bigger picture outside of Oppenheimer's sphere. The greater war, Japanese casualties, and other historical events are shaped through dialogue and interactions. This is purposely done because Los Alamos, the town created for the Manhattan Project, was completely insular, as well as the brutal hearing that tore Oppenheimer apart. There will be heated discussions whether Nolan was too limited in his scope.   Oppenheimer has excellent performances across the board, but two stand out in conjunction with Murphy's brilliant lead. Pugh is daring and graphically sexual as Jean Tatlock. It's rare to see an A-list talent willing to do nudity for a role. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kitty, Oppenheimer's thrice-divorced alcoholic wife, and stalwart companion in his darkest moments. She's a formidable presence against the wolves hunting her husband for his political beliefs. The contrast between these two women, and their effect on Oppenheimer, is mesmerizing to behold. Pugh and Blunt will unfortunately contend against each other come awards season.   Nolan's uncompromising vision deserves every accolade but admittedly isn't for everyone.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Most people know that the United States dropped bombs on Japan in an effort to end World War II once and for all, but the majority of those people aren’t aware of how those bombs came to be. Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was a key player, along with a team of scientists, in developing the atomic bomb. Christopher Nolan’s film, Oppenheimer, details this story in what is sure to be called one of his best films, and a true cinematic masterpiece. Although extremely chilling and devastating, this movie proves to be something truly special. It should be seen by all, if only in an effort not to repeat our past mistakes. It is haunting, and plays like a horror film at times. Not to mention, that every single actor, no matter how small or large their role, brings their A-game. Oppenheimer is a movie that will not soon be forgotten, and the final line will cut through most like a knife, lingering in our brains as we watch the world fall to pieces around us. Note: This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Oppenheimer would not exist without the labor of the writers and actors in both unions. Take one look at the cast list for Oppenheimer and it should come as no surprise that this is a well acted film. From the very moment it starts, viewers will be sucked into the world of the 1940s, and never look back. This is due to the set design, costuming, hair, and production, of course, but it is also because these actors know exactly what they are doing, and they fully embrace their roles.  Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, and he fully commits to the part. He comes off as brilliant, yet distant, and isn’t afraid to dive right into the womanizing accusations, either. The entire third hour, he has a horrified look in his eyes that makes it clear he regrets his role in creating the atomic bomb. Or at least regrets what the government did with it.  Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect counterpart to Murphy. The two play off of each other extremely well. Now, if you have been around my writing for a while, you know I am Team Iron Man, but Oppenheimer is hands down the best thing that Robert Downey Jr. has ever done. He might have been born to play Tony Stark, but he was also born to assume the role of Lewis Strauss. He delivers each and every line with perfection, and in the final half hour of the film, truly shines.  Emily Blunt, who plays Kitty Oppenheimer, has wonderful on screen chemistry with Cillian. There are moments that zoom in on her face that will make the audience feel exactly what the character is feeling. From her tears to her scowls, she is easy to relate to and understand.  I could go on and on about every other person in this film — Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, David Dastmalchian, Josh Peck, Jack Quad, Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie — but the truth is that this is a phenomenal ensemble cast. No matter if they are on screen for a few minutes, or nearly the whole three hour film, no one took their job lightly. Each person has left an impression on the audience, and knew the worth of this movie and their role in it. When it comes to the cinematography and incredible visuals of Oppenheimer, I feel like I need to preface this portion of my review by stating I was able to view this film in IMAX 70mm, which is very much the way it was intended to be seen. There are only twenty-five theaters in the country that are able to play it this way, and that certainly heightens the senses and allows for a top notch viewing experience.  That being said, this movie is going to be stunning no matter how you watch it. Nolan is one of those people who just knows what he is doing in this department, and I don’t think that anyone will challenge that, based on his previous films. The visuals are a marvel. Viewers will find themselves in awe of what we see on screen, especially during certain scenes.  This is one of those movies that can be claimed to have been made for the big screen. It is a spectacular feast for the eyes that if nothing else, provides a lot of eye candy. The thing is, there is so much more to Oppenheimer than that.  The sound design really needs to be pointed out here. There are a few moments where sound takes a scene to a while new level. When the bomb first goes off, so many sounds are removed, causing what feels like a vacuum chamber. The score is removed and we are left with just the basic sounds. It is nearly impossible to describe, but once you see the movie, you will know exactly what I am talking about. That is the moments that Oppenheimer solidifies itself as a masterpiece. What comes after is just icing on the cake. Oppenheimer is a heavy movie, but it didn’t need to focus on the gruesomeness of the bomb aftermath to get its point across. Nolan was able to do that with the score, sound design, and the story itself. Not only is the movie very accurate to the true events (my husband who spent years in the Nuclear field and military can attest to that), it does this in a way that makes it easy for those who don’t have a background in this field to understand.  Don’t get me wrong, there are some people and terms that I had to clarify after, but it wasn’t overly hard to follow, which it easily could have been if not done in the right way. That being said, those that are in this field, and that are passionate about it one way or another, are going to love what was done here. My husband walked out saying this is solidified as one of his favorite films of all time.  Probably my biggest issue with Oppenheimer is the length. I am not saying that it doesn’t warrant a three hour runtime, because there wasn’t anything I felt like absolutely needed to be removed from the story in order for it to flow better. However, I did start to fade for about fifteen minutes in the middle, but was quickly pulled back in once the bomb test scene occurred.  The thing is, there is a lot of talking in this movie. Nolan does what he does to make it interesting for the vast majority of the audience, but some people are going to zone out at times. That is just the nature of the game when it comes to talk of chemistry and specialized terms.  Oppenheimer is rated R, partly due to the nudity of Florence Pugh a few times throughout the film. While these scenes didn’t feel one hundred percent necessary, the relationship between her character, Jean Tatlock, and J. Robert Oppenheimer, helps to speak to his character. She was very important in the man’s life and something that happens to her plays a key role in how his disposition goes later on. Oppenheimer does a lot of jumping back and forth from the past to the “present”. The use of color and black and white is used to explain which time we are in, without having to continue to state it. This takes away a lot of confusion that could have occurred, had it not been laid out in an understandable way. Still, this is another place where I found an issue with the movie. There were times where I felt completely invested in something that was happening, only the be ripped and pulled from that and jump to the other time frame that is being explored in Oppenheimer. That being said, Nolan always went back to finish the story I was invested in, so I guess I can’t complain too much. Oppenheimer tells a dark and chilling story. They say all is fair in love and war but the truth is the United States dropped devastating bombs on another country and killed innocent people. Having a hand in that is sure to mess you up, at least a little bit, even if it was your job to do it. There are moments in this movie that feel like a horror film, largely due to the way the sound and visuals are done. Reminiscent of The Tell-Tale Heart in a way that will send a shiver down anyone’s spine. Oppenheimer is a masterpiece on many levels — the acting, the visuals, and the sound design to name a few — but it serves as an extremely important movie, that everyone should watch at some point in their lives. Perhaps it can change the overall opinion of war, and going too far just because we can. Probably not, but one can hope. Written and directed by Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer is an IMAX®-shot epic thriller that thrusts audiences into the pulse-pounding paradox of the enigmatic man who must risk destroying the world in order to save it. The film stars Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer and Emily Blunt as his wife, biologist and botanist Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer. Oscar® winner Matt Damon portrays General Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project, and Robert Downey, Jr. plays Lewis Strauss, a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Academy Award® nominee Florence Pugh plays psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, Benny Safdie plays theoretical physicist Edward Teller, Michael Angarano plays Robert Serber and Josh Hartnett plays pioneering American nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence. The cast includes Dane DeHaan (Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets), Dylan Arnold (Halloween franchise), David Krumholtz (The Ballad of Buster Scruggs), Alden Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) and Matthew Modine (The Dark Knight Rises). The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin. The film is produced by Emma Thomas, Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven and Christopher Nolan. Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX® 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX® black and white analogue photography.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" has been sold as an event movie, a thriller about the making of the atomic bomb crafted with practical effects spectacle that demands to be seen on the biggest screen possible. The film is exactly that — for about an hour in the middle of its three-hour runtime. That hour spent in Los Alamos, New Mexico, is incredible, but this biopic casts its historical net a lot wider than just its subject's most infamous achievement. It's bigger in scope, yet more intimate in focus than you might expect. All the stylistic traits you've come to expect from a Nolan blockbuster are there: complicated nonlinear timelines, grand IMAX cinematography, and an overpowering sound mix. What's different here is that all of these techniques are for the most part being applied to scenes of men sitting at tables having serious conversations. It's more like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""The Social Network"" than it is like ""Dunkirk."" And the subjects of those conversations might also come as a surprise to the less historically informed: there's some talk about the bomb, of course, but much more of the drama is dealing with McCarthyism, leftist politics, personal vendettas, and the nature of public forgiveness. The result is a film stuffed to the brim with things to think about. Maybe it's a bit overstuffed, to the point it can be hard to keep track of everything if you don't seriously know your history. I suspect it might be easier to follow on repeat viewing, and as heavy as the movie is, it becomes gripping enough that many will want to see it twice. Even with the length and complexity on display in ""Oppenheimer,"" Nolan is a director who knows how to hold an audience's attention, whether it's in a bomb test or a political hearing. The life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is framed via two different political hearings: one targeting Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954, the other concerning the nomination of rival scientist Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of commerce in 1959. The movie cuts back and forth between the different hearings, and then further back in time to the not-entirely-linear presentation of events discussed within those hearings. Oppenheimer's hearing and the recollections therein are filmed in color, while Strauss' side of the story is filmed in black and white. Oppenheimer was a target of the Red Scare, and Strauss was responsible for targeting him. Oppenheimer, a self-described ""New Deal Democrat,"" was never a member of the Communist Party, though many of his friends and loved ones were and he worked with Communists on such worthy causes as supporting the Loyalists in the Spanish Civil War and unionizing professors (relevant to the current Hollywood strikes). As a Jewish man, his participation in the Manhattan Project was driven by a personal understanding of the dangers Adolf Hitler posed — though Hitler ended up dying well before the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Murphy excels at depicting Oppenheimer's overwhelmed nature, the impossibility of squaring all of his ideals and contradictions in the face of horrors he's responsible for. Strauss' story of a petty grudge escalating into ultimately self-defeating vengeance doesn't have quite as many layers, but it's a delight to get to see Downey disappear into playing a real person again after over a decade stuck in an Iron Man suit. Beyond the two perspective characters, there are a ton of other great actors in this cast — basically, everyone in Hollywood who didn't get cast in ""Barbie."" The film serves up a constant stream of ""Hey, it's that guy!"" moments — both for those recognizing the actors and those recognizing the early 20th-century scientists and politicians they're playing. As with many Nolan films, the roles for women aren't anything outstanding. On some level, that's built into the material; a historical film set in a historically hyper-masculine world generally isn't gonna focus on women. The bigger problem with the only two significant female characters being Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), and his girlfriend, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), is that Nolan is simply bad at writing romance. Blunt at least gets one great acting showcase scene while being questioned in the hearing amidst all the biopic-standard ""crying wife"" scenes. Pugh, meanwhile, gets saddled with a sex scene that's so laughable you wouldn't believe me if I told you the dialogue. 
As interesting as the material is, ""Oppenheimer"" takes a bit of time to really get going. Abstract flashes of the nuclear explosion early on in the film are attention-grabbing, but the nonlinear wide-ranging nature in the first act can leave you wondering when is the film finally gonna get to the main attraction. After Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) starts talking with Oppenheimer about the government's top-secret program, however, the storytelling gets more focused and suspenseful. The dual framing devices go away for longer and longer stretches — and when they do return in full force in the final act, we're a lot more emotionally invested.





I was not able to attend an IMAX screening (got the next best thing with a traditional 70 mm screening) and can only imagine how overwhelming some moments must be in Nolan's preferred format. I'm not even just talking about the Trinity bomb test (a masterwork of ""how did they do that?"" effects work). Many of the most visually stunning and disturbing scenes are smaller moments from Oppenheimer's subjective point of view, where cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema evokes a next-level fusion of ""Vertigo"" and ""The Tree of Life.""
The personal and political conflicts between Oppenheimer and Strauss come together with the apocalyptic concerns of the protagonist's central accomplishment for an ending that will surely stick in your nightmares. Anyone attempting the ""Barbenheimer"" double feature is advised to take a significant breather between films to process it all.

"Jul 19, 2023"," It’s fitting that Christopher Nolan uses the opening minutes of Oppenheimer to evoke the myth of Prometheus, the legendary titan who stole fire from the Gods and gave it to humanity, only to suffer terrible consequences. Nolan’s film is, after all, adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning biography American Prometheus. But there’s more to the allusion than a nod in the direction of the source material. For the filmmaker himself, the comparison to Prometheus is a warning of what we’re about to see, the announcement of a uniquely American tragedy that’s rooted in reality yet also mythic in scope and ambition. In other words, it’s Nolan calling his shot, swinging for the fences in ways that even he never has before. What follows is perhaps his most self-assured and passionate cinematic effort so far, a film so thunderous and heavy that it just might knock you through the back wall of the theater. As he has so often throughout his career, Nolan takes a nonlinear approach to the story, here laying out the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), the soft-spoken, intensely brilliant father of the atomic bomb. The film bounces with precision and grace between crucial moments in Oppenheimer’s life, from the day he met his eventual wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) to his arrival at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton to, of course, the launch of the Manhattan Project that would give birth to the world’s first nuclear weapon. Along the way, we meet many figures that buoy and challenge him, from a young woman named Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) to a Washington D.C. maneuverer named Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), the latter hewing closer to Oppenheimer’s personal journey than perhaps even he realizes.  The purpose of all the weaving, between Oppenheimer’s student days and the security hearings that challenged his reputation in the 1950s, is not just to allow Nolan opportunities to play with certain symmetries in the physicist’s life, though he certainly makes time for those. Instead, there’s a kind of scientific detail to the way the film chooses to express these moments in a certain order, a sense that getting the combination right will incite a certain chain reaction in the audience. For Oppenheimer, who sees the makeup of the world in ways that no one else does, a chance encounter in the 1920s could change the world in the 1940s, then doom the same world in the 1960s. With that feeling ever-present in the beautifully rendered script—which features several key moments lifted almost verbatim from Bird and Sherwin’s book—all that time-hopping never feels like a gimmick. But Nolan doesn’t hold this all together alone. He has plenty of help from a team of collaborators bringing their best, from the gorgeous cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema—who captures everything from New Mexico snow to black-and-white Senate hearings with searing power—to the blistering, relentless score of Ludwig Göransson that makes you feel every beat. Then, of course, there’s the cast, led by a driven, vulnerable, remarkably controlled performance from Murphy in the title role. His Oppenheimer is a constantly simmering cauldron not just of brilliance, but of indecision coupled with the idea that for all the talk of his heroism and his genius, he might not actually be a good person. At one point, while musing about his place in the world, he mentions that brilliance allows him to “get away with” many of his own shortcomings. It’s one of the keys to unlocking the film, and Murphy keeps that tone humming throughout. Alongside him, Downey Jr. turns in some of his best work in years, Pugh and Blunt are wonderful presences, and Matt Damon turns in scene-stealing work as Manhattan Project military lead, General Leslie Groves.  If you’re going to see Oppenheimer, though, it’s not just because it’s a movie full of stars. Odds are you’re turning up at the theater to see how Christopher Nolan films one of the most famous explosions in the history of humankind, and there’s no doubt the director is very aware of the anticipation built around that moment in the film. Thanks to Göransson’s score and masterful editing by Jennifer Lame, the Trinity Test in the New Mexico desert arrives slowly, piece by piece, allowing the weight of the moment to settle over the actors and the audience like a shroud. Then, in an instant, it’s all ripped away in one of the most dazzling, sobering, instantly iconic sequences you’re likely to see at the movies this year.  J. Robert Oppenheimer was a mass of contradictions and complications. He was undeniably brilliant, yet he could be distant and selfish, often by his own admission. He was able to command a room of students or colleagues, yet crumble in the face of personal crises. He was, in the end, one of the 20th century’s most recognizable creators and one of its most recognizable destroyers. Nolan could have framed his film around any one of these contradictions and found something compelling and sustaining to carry the narrative for three hours. Instead, he approaches and addresses them all, giving us the good and the bad of Oppenheimer in such dynamic ways that you will root for the man in one scene, then wonder in the very next if you backed the wrong horse. It’s a remarkable exercise in narrative balance, and it’s made all the more impressive by the sheer mythic quality of the story of a man who took command of primal, incomprehensibly destructive forces, then spent the rest of his life collapsing under the weight of what he’d unleashed.  For all this and more, Oppenheimer deserves the title of masterpiece. It’s Christopher Nolan’s best film so far, a step up to a new level for one of our finest filmmakers, and a movie that burns itself into your brain.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," J. Robert Oppenheimer wasn’t killed by his creation in the same way that Marie Curie and Victor Frankenstein were, but he was irrevocably altered by it. How could he not have been? The atomic bomb is one of science’s greatest achievements, which isn’t necessarily to say that it was a good thing. Oppenheimer was well aware of that paradox, as evidenced by the Bhagavad Gita passage he thought of after the successful Trinity test on July 16, 1945: “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.” Less than a month later, as many as 200,000 people were killed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and World War II was over.  Oppenheimer himself may not have needed 80 years of hindsight to reach insightful conclusions about what he’d wrought, but Oppenheimer certainly benefits from it. That it’s being presented as anything resembling a traditional summer blockbuster is a choice, as the kids say, as Christopher Nolan’s three-hour slow burn is much closer in scope, tone, and dramatic heft to an autumnal prestige picture. It’s also even more of a wall-to-wall ensemble than Asteroid City, with Cillian Murphy’s performance in the title role complemented by those of Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Matthew Modine, Jason Clarke, Benny Safdie, and Gary Oldman. That many of their appearances amount to glorified cameos is, one assumes, a testament to how eager everyone involved was to, well, be involved, but it also underscores the fact that the scientists and government officials working with Oppenheimer were more than just bit players in this chapter of history. While all of this is obviously building to the successful Trinity test, both in terms of its narrative crescendo and what an awe-inspiring sensory experience it promises to be, it’s something of a false climax. Fallout comes in many forms, and for Oppenheimer it was a postwar reckoning with not only what he’d done but how his left-wing beliefs would come to be weaponized against him in a closed-door hearing concerning his security clearance. That hearing and the circumstances surrounding it make up the lion’s share of the third act, which proves to be no less riveting than the splitting of the atom. That’s thanks in no small part to Downey Jr., now out of the iron suit and delivering his best performance in ages as Lewis Strauss of the Atomic Energy Commission. Which isn’t to say that the explosion isn’t one of the most intense visual spectacles this side of The Tree of Life’s birth-of-the-universe sequence or a certain episode of Twin Peaks: The Return. You can feel the world changing forever as you see it, terrible in its wrath and unfathomable in its implications — a birth and a death all at once, and perhaps the most breathtaking sequence of Nolan’s career. To be clear, none of the men who interrogated Oppenheimer in 1954 were the least bit troubled by the death and destruction wrought by his creation. (To extend the Frankenstein metaphor a bit, Oppenheimer is based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s biography American Prometheus and the subtitle of Mary Shelley’s novel is The Modern Prometheus.) What they were really interested in was whether he was then, or had ever been, a member of the Communist Party of the United States. Member? No. Fellow traveler? Yes. Oppenheimer was even more intensely intellectual than you might imagine, and while he was decidedly left wing, his prewar interest in communism, at least as portrayed here, appears to have been largely academic. This being the 1950s and his usefulness to the military-industrial complex having diminished, however, such nuances are of little concern to the men who hold his fate in their hands. Nolan cuts between this hearing and what you might call the main action almost constantly. Though this initially lends the film a disjointed quality — especially since Nolan, who has a habit of over-explaining his wonkier narratives like Inception and Interstellar via expository dialogue, goes the opposite route here and never deigns to have his characters describe the intricacies of nuclear fission in layman’s terms — the structural gambit plays off in the final hour. It’s only once the fog of war has cleared that people truly reveal themselves. Murphy, who’s ranked among our finest actors for decades but rarely had more high-profile leading roles than those in 28 Days Later and The Wind That Shakes the Barley to complement his acclaimed supporting performances (a few of which were also directed by Nolan), brings a tortured brilliance to his performance that wholly befits his subject. Anyone concerned that Nolan set out to create a rah-rah glorification of atomic weapons that doesn’t grapple with the morality of both their invention and  implementation will have their fears more than assuaged. You see it etched on Oppenheimer’s face, to say nothing of his fleeting visions of disintegrated bodies and flashes of blinding light that plague him years after Fat Man and Little Boy are dropped from nearly six miles above the earth they changed forever. There’s more than one way to lose your life to a bomb.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Almost all of Oppenheimer is composed of conversation. There’s academic back-and-forth among theoretical physicists as they scribble nuclear equations on chalkboards; heated conversations between American politicians and military leaders about World War II and the fate of the country should the Nazis win; terse, loaded exchanges at panels and congressional hearings, with investigations sifting through rumors and conjecture in an effort to determine these scientists’ loyalty to the United States. The director Christopher Nolan rarely slows down to let his protagonist, J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), actually think. When he does, the audience sees particles swirling in Oppenheimer’s mind, neutrons smashing and sparking, elemental forces being harnessed through intelligence and will. It’s mesmerizing but also quite inscrutable—a beautiful representation of the terrible power Oppenheimer channeled in his involvement with the Manhattan Project, which created (and detonated) the first nuclear weapons. Nolan’s film encompasses far more than that, cramming almost all of the doorstop-size biography American Prometheus into a three-hour running time by moving at breakneck speed. It covers Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a student and his postwar battles with the government over his alleged Communist past. The result is a talky biopic with the intensity of an action movie, a series of meetings in offices and bunkers that somehow drives the planet to the brink of apocalypse. Although the visual scale is smaller than the many widescreen epics Nolan has made—save for the part where the bomb goes off—Oppenheimer might be his most ambitious work as a filmmaker to date. It’s also a fascinating companion piece to the only other Nolan movie that’s rooted in real-life events: 2017’s Dunkirk. That film, which depicted the evacuation of Allied troops during World War II, was light on dialogue and heavy on complex action set pieces, bombarding the viewer’s eyes and ears with the fury of the front lines. Much of Oppenheimer is set during the same war, but it focuses on the behind-the-scenes figures who sought to end the war without firing a bullet. Nolan’s chief fascination, of course, is Oppenheimer himself, whom Murphy plays as a grand enigma—icy at times and effortlessly charming at others, sympathetic to leftist revolutionary causes but happy to bury those sympathies as he begins steering the Manhattan Project. The film’s first hour barrels through his student years and his early days as a physicist in England and Germany; Oppenheimer crosses paths with legends in his field such as Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), and Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer). Their energetic discussions of quantum mechanics and atomic theory are difficult to keep up with, but as the plot thundered on, I realized that was part of the point: Even these esteemed men of science can’t quite grasp what they’re dealing with. The viewer knows where things are headed—the total success of the Manhattan Project, and the consequences of the weapons it produced—but there’s a frightening lack of awareness as, spurred by a fear of the Nazis reaching the same consequential milestone first, the development of the bomb is set in motion. Throughout the action, Nolan ping-pongs between timelines, as he has in many films past. In painstaking detail, he depicts the humiliating 1954 hearings that stripped Oppenheimer of his security clearance and dredged up both his past associations with Communists and his overactive love life. A more daring element, told in black and white, follows the former Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (a tremendous Robert Downey Jr.) as he undergoes a Senate confirmation hearing for a Cabinet post, digging through the politician’s tense relationship and eventual enmity with Oppenheimer. The majority of the story, shown in color and centered on Oppenheimer, fizzes with energy and possibility; the Strauss-centric sequences are slow, seething, and obsessed with the past, representative of the conservatism and paranoia that calcified around the atomic society Oppenheimer helped to create. Nolan’s ambition is to intertwine multiple biographical threads about his subject and his historical context. There’s the mad dash to create nuclear weapons, a thrilling race against time with an explosive conclusion: the Trinity bomb test that proved their theories correct. There’s the larger moral conflict that emerged especially after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as scientists such as Oppenheimer started begging governments to back away from the deadly arms race that politicians like Strauss were effectively pushing for. And then there are the deepest mysteries of Oppenheimer himself, a man who pleaded for peace later in life but who never fully held himself publicly accountable for the hundreds of thousands left dead by his invention. As Oppenheimer zips toward its conclusion and switches perspectives with increasing mania, it becomes clear how carefully Nolan is working to keep the audience’s attention on his story’s lofty scope without losing sight of its cryptic protagonist. Murphy, with his frost-blue eyes fixed in a permanent thousand-yard stare, keeps the viewer (and the people around him) at arm’s length. But as the years pile on, it’s obvious how the guilt has stacked up too. The film lets reality start to crack around Oppenheimer as a result, turning the Trinity test into a haunting, invasive specter he can never quite shake. Nolan is best known for spectacle, and some viewers will be able to see Oppenheimer in bone-rattling IMAX, projected on a skyscraper-size screen. But it’s more impressive for how the director has made such a personal narrative feel epic, not just in visual breadth but in dramatic sweep, presenting a story from the past that feels knotted to so many present anxieties about nuclear annihilation. After racing his way to scientific progress and achievement, Oppenheimer is confronted with an amoral world he had previously ignored; that existential horror, and the way it echoed into the 21st century, is the real hammer wielded by this tale.",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," Not many filmmakers in the streaming era are given latitude from traditional studios to make original movies, let alone a $100 million budgeted adult drama, released in the middle of the busy summer movie going season, about a controversial quantum physicist with no CGI, capes, major spectacle, or built in brand awareness. Then again, not many filmmakers are Christopher Nolan, one of the few remaining directors who makes his films for the biggest screens imaginable with an emphasis on total immersion and ear shattering sound design. So, it’s no surprise “Oppenheimer,” a three-hour biopic about the “father of the atomic bomb” J. Robert Oppenheimer, where most of the movie is people talking in rooms (most of the time in black and white) about splitting atoms and the moral dilemmas of creating a world killer, is one of the most cinematic achievements of the year. Marvel could never. Based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus,” Nolan’s star-studded affair chronicles Oppenheimer, played here with a fierce unwavering tenacity by Cillian Murphy in a career best performance, and his development of the first nuclear weapon as part of the Manhattan Project, an earth-shattering event that ushered in the Atomic Age. The movie, presented in a swift three act structure that mirrors the director’s own “Memento,” grapples with the horrors, innovation, and intensity of the project where the physicists in charge never could say with 100% certainty the bomb’s aftershocks wouldn’t destroy the atmosphere. It makes for a dramatic, race-against-the-clock thriller where Nolan relies heavily on real locations and zero CGI to get his point across. He puts the audience in the room during the infamous “Trinity Test,” the assessment that provided proof of concept, as the seconds tick away and even though we know the outcome, we’re still hanging on every moment. It's a dense movie with “Tenet” collaborator Ludwig Göransson’s magnetic score and Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography (a stunner in 70mm) elevating the performances and narrative. Speaking of performances, there’s plenty to go around. Probably too many to name. It’s a who’s who of families faces, some, like Tony Goldwyn, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman, and Rami Malek, have a sliver of screen-time. Elsewhere, at any given moment Kenneth Branagh, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck (!), and even, checks notes, Dane DeHaan pop up sporadically throughout the movie playing real generals and scientists. Occasionally, it can give a case of whiplash trying to keep up. Was that Alden Ehrenreich, and Olivia Thirbly that just passed through? It sure was! Even 90s teen heartthrob Josh Hartnett, who is having a bit of a resurgence, is given a sizable role-playing Oppenheimer confidant Ernest Lawrence. Hell, Benny Safdie is a riot playing Hungarian physicist Edward Teller. Though each of those actors are given their moment to shine, you also got Matt Damon chewing up the role of Leslie Richard Groves Jr, the United States Army Corps general who took a flier on Oppenheimer and his merry band of whiz-kids, often clashing with the doctor on areas of national security. But the real revelation, aside from Murphy, belongs to Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss, the U.S Atomic Energy Commission chair who’s battle with Oppenheimer over his security clearance in closed door meetings ended up becoming a major part of his political legacy. In these moments, especially the interrogations, Nolan tinkers with the subjective and objective point of views by switching back and forth between color and black-and-white, the latter of which had never been created for an IMAX film camera. In Nolan we trust. With the men soaking up the airwaves, it leaves the actresses little wiggle room to stand out, which is often a major criticism of Nolan’s films. Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock has maybe ten minutes of airtime? The script gives minimal levity to her frail mental state and relationship with Oppenheimer, and it can seem, at times, Pugh is stuck in her own universe. Emily Blunt is given a tad more leash playing Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer, but again the script only gets at the surface of her struggles. The movie briefly touches on her issues regarding alcoholism and raising two children and never does it poke at their marital strife. These minor subplots, meant to show Oppenheimer could be a womanizer when he wanted to be, add little to the overall focus of the movie. They’re disconnected from the real crux of what the film is chasing. Still, “Oppenheimer” is a riveting character study that wraps its head around one of the country’s greatest minds. Here’s someone who has been mischaracterized and misunderstood for generations and Nolan is attempting to set the record straight while also pointing the camera back at us and asking: How did we get here? It hits like a sack of bricks and lingers with you long after the credits roll. It also, ironically, can be seen as representative of the era we’re currently living in. With the development of advanced weaponry, wars across the globe, and wildfires invading our air quality, a ripple effect has been initiated that, akin to what Oppenheimer and his team feared when giving the United States unchecked power to decimate entire populations, is past the point of no return. History has been repeating itself for decades, now we must live with the consequences.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," For all the pre-release speculation about how analog epic-maker Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" would re-create the explosion of the first atomic bomb, the film's most spectacular attraction turns out to be something else: the human face.  This three-plus hour biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is a film about faces. They talk, a lot. They listen. They react to good and bad news. And sometimes they get lost in their own heads—none more so than the title character, the supervisor of the nuclear weapons team at Los Alamos whose apocalyptic contribution to science earned him the nickname The American Prometheus (as per the title of Nolan's primary source, the biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherman). Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema use the large-format IMAX film system not merely to capture the splendor of New Mexico's desert panoramas but contrast the external coolness and internal turmoil of Oppenheimer, a brilliant mathematician and low-key showman and leader whose impulsive nature and insatiable sexual appetites made his private life a disaster, and whose greatest contribution to civilization was a weapon that could destroy it. Close-up after close-up shows star Cillian Murphy's face staring into the middle distance, off-screen, and sometimes directly into the lens, while Oppenheimer dissociates from unpleasant interactions, or gets lost inside memories, fantasies, and waking nightmares. ""Oppenheimer"" rediscovers the power of huge closeups of people's faces as they grapple with who they are, and who other people have decided that they are, and what they've done to themselves and others.  Sometimes the close-ups of people's faces are interrupted by flash-cuts of events that haven't happened, or already happened. There are recurring images of flame, debris, and smaller chain-reaction explosions that resemble strings of firecrackers, as well as non-incendiary images that evoke other awful, personal disasters. (There are a lot of gradually expanding flashbacks in this film, where you see a glimpse of something first, then a bit more of it, and then finally the entire thing.) But these don't just relate to the big bomb that Oppenheimer's team hopes to detonate in the desert, or the little ones that are constantly detonating in Oppenheimer's life, sometimes because he personally pushed the big red button in a moment of anger, pride or lust, and other times because he made a naive or thoughtless mistake that pissed somebody off long ago, and the wronged person retaliated with the equivalent of a time-delayed bomb. The ""fissile"" cutting, to borrow a physics word, is also a metaphor for the domino effect caused by individual decisions, and the chain reaction that makes other things happen as a result. This principle is also visualized by repeated images of ripples in water, starting with the opening closeup of raindrops setting off expanding circles on the surface that foreshadow both the ending of Oppenheimer's career as a government advisor and public figure and the explosion of the first nuke at Los Alamos (which observers see, then hear, then finally feel, in all its awful impact).  The weight of the film's interests and meanings are carried by faces—not just Oppenheimer's, but those of other significant characters, including General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Los Alamos' military supervisor; Robert's suffering wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), whose tactical mind could have averted a lot of disasters if her husband would have only listened; and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.), the Atomic Energy Commission chair who despised Oppenheimer for a lot of reasons, including his decision to distance himself from his Jewish roots, and who spent several years trying to derail Oppenheimer's post-Los Alamos career. The latter constitutes its own adjacent full-length story about pettiness, mediocrity, and jealousy. Strauss is Salieri to Oppenheimer's Mozart, regularly and often pathetically reminding others that he studied physics, too, back in the day, and that he's a good person, unlike Oppenheimer the adulterer and communist sympathizer. (This film asserts that Strauss leaked the FBI file on his progressive and communist associations to a third party who then wrote to the bureau's director, J. Edgar Hoover.) The film speaks quite often of one of the principles of quantum physics, which holds that observing quantum phenomena by a detector or an instrument can change the results of this experiment. The editing illustrates it by constantly re-framing our perception of an event to change its meaning, and the script does it by adding new information that undermines, contradicts, or expands our sense of why a character did something, or whether they even knew why they did it.  That, I believe, is really what ""Oppenheimer"" is about, much more so than the atom bomb itself, or even its impact on the war and the Japanese civilian population, which is talked about but never shown. The film does show what the atom bomb does to human flesh, but it's not recreations of the actual attacks on Japan: the agonized Oppenheimer imagines Americans going through it. This filmmaking decision is likely to antagonize both viewers who wanted a more direct reckoning with the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and those who have bought into the arguments advanced by Strauss and others that the bombs had to be dropped because Japan never would have surrendered otherwise. The movie doesn't indicate whether it thinks that interpretation is true or if it sides more with Oppenheimer and others who insisted that Japan was on its knees by that point in World War II and would have eventually given up without atomic attacks that killed hundreds of thousands of civilians. No, this is a film that permits itself the freedoms and indulgences of novelists, poets, and opera composers. It does what we expect it to do: Dramatize the life of Oppenheimer and other historically significant people in his orbit in an aesthetically daring way while also letting all of the characters and all of the events be used metaphorically and symbolically as well, so that they become pointillistic elements in a much larger canvas that's about the mysteries of the human personality and the unforeseen impact of decisions made by individuals and societies. This is another striking thing about ""Oppenheimer."" It's not entirely about Oppenheimer even though Murphy's baleful face and haunting yet opaque eyes dominate the movie. It's also about the effect of Oppenheimer's personality and decisions on other people, from the other strong-willed members of his atom bomb development team (including Benny Safdie's Edwin Teller, who wanted to skip ahead to create the much more powerful hydrogen bomb, and eventually did) to the beleaguered Kitty; Oppenheimer's mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, who has some of Gloria Grahame's self-immolating smolder); General Groves, who likes Oppenheimer in spite of his arrogance but isn't going to side with him over the United States government; and even Harry Truman, the US president who ordered the atom bomb dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki (played in a marvelous cameo by Gary Oldman) and who derides Oppenheimer as a naive and narcissistic ""crybaby"" who sees history mainly in terms of his own feelings. Jennifer Lame's editing is prismatic and relentless, often in a faintly Terrence Malick-y way, skipping between three or more time periods within seconds. It's wedded to virtually nonstop music by Ludwig Göransson that fuses with the equally relentless dialogue and monologues to create an odd but distinctive sort of scientifically expository aria that's probably what it would feel like to read American Prometheus while listening to a playlist of Philip Glass film scores. Non-linear movies like this one do a better job of capturing the pinball-machine motions of human consciousness than linear movies do, and they also capture what it's like to read a third-person omniscient book (or a biography that permits itself to imagine what its subjects might have been thinking or feeling). It also paradoxically captures the mental process of reading a text and responding to it emotionally and viscerally as well as intellectually. The mind stays anchored to the text. But it also jumps outside of it, connecting the text to other texts, to external knowledge, and to one's own experience and imaginings. This review hasn't delved into the plot of the film or the real-world history that inspired it, not because it isn't important (of course it is) but because—as is always the case with Nolan—the main attraction is not the tale but the telling. Nolan has been derided as less a dramatist than half showman, half mathematician, making bombastic, overcomplicated blockbusters that are as much puzzles as stories. But whether that characterization was true (and I'm increasingly convinced it never entirely was) it seems beside the point when you see how thoughtfully and rewardingly it's been applied to a biography of a real person. ""Oppenheimer"" could retrospectively seem like a turning point in the director's filmography, when he takes all of the stylistic and technical practices that he'd been honing for the previous twenty years in intellectualized pulp blockbusters and turns them inward. The movie is an academic-psychedelic biography in the vein of those 1990s Oliver Stone films that were edited within an inch of their lives (at times it's as if the park bench scene in ""JFK"" had been expanded to three hours). There's also a strain of pitch-black humor, in a Stanley Kubrick mode, as when top government officials meet to go over a list of possible Japanese cities to bomb, and the man reading the list says that he just made an executive decision to delete Kyoto from it because he and his wife honeymooned there. (The Kubrick connection is cemented further by the presence of ""Full Metal Jacket"" star Matthew Modine, who co-stars as American engineer and inventor Vannevar Bush.) It’s an example of top-of-the-line, studio-produced popular art with a dash of swagger, variously evoking Michael Mann's ""The Insider,"" late-period Terrence Malick, nonlinearly-edited art cinema touchstones like ""Hiroshima Mon Amour,"" ""The Pawnbroker,"" ""All That Jazz"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""; and, inevitably, ""Citizen Kane"" (there's even a Rosebud-like mystery surrounding what Oppenheimer and his hero Albert Einstein, played by Tom Conti, talked about on the banks of a Princeton pond).  Most of the performances have a bit of an ""old movie"" feeling, with the actors snapping off their lines and not moving their faces as much as they would in a more modern story. A lot of the dialogue is delivered quickly, producing a screwball comedy energy. This comes through most strongly in the arguments between Robert and Kitty about his sexual indiscretions and refusal to listen to her mostly superb advice; the more abstract debates about power and responsibility between Robert and General Groves, and the scenes between Strauss and a Senate aide (Alden Ehrenreich) who is advising him as he testifies before a committee that he hopes will approve him to serve in President Dwight Eisenhower's cabinet. But as a physical experience, ""Oppenheimer"" is something else entirely—it's hard to say exactly what, and that's what's so fascinating about it. I've already heard complaints that the movie is ""too long,"" that it could've ended with the first bomb detonating, and could've done without the bits about Oppenheimer's sex life and the enmity of Strauss, and that it's perversely self-defeating to devote so much of the running time, including the most of the third hour, to a pair of governmental hearings: the one where Oppenheimer tries to get his security clearance renewed, and Strauss trying to get approved for Eisenhower's cabinet. But the film's furiously entropic tendencies complement the theoretical discussions of the how's and why's of the individual and collective personality. To greater and lesser degrees, all of the characters are appearing before a tribunal and bring called to account for their contradictions, hypocrisies, and sins. The tribunal is out there in the dark. We've been given the information but not told what to decide, which is as it should be.

"Jul 19, 2023"," How do you turn the story of the atomic bomb's creation into a thriller suitable for blockbuster status in the thick of summer movie season? If you're writer/director Christopher Nolan, you stack your cast with an almost absurd list of stars and twist the tale of J. Robert Oppenheimer into a three-prong exploration of genius, regret, and historic horror.  For Nolan devotees, there's plenty in Oppenheimer to marvel over, from its incredible ensemble's crackling chemistry to Ludwig Göransson's immersive and disturbing score, to a corner of modern history that challenges audiences with complex moral questions and unapologetic dread. But after a year's worth of anticipation — and a rivalry with Greta Gerwig's Barbie — can Oppenheimer live up to the hype as Nolan's best film yet?  As screenwriter and director, Nolan has adapted Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's non-fiction book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer into a historical epic that centers on the adult life of the ""father of the atomic bomb."" Cillian Murphy, who has previously worked with Nolan on The Dark Knight trilogy, Dunkirk, and Inception, stars as Oppenheimer, the Jewish-American theoretical physicist who led the U.S. government's secret Manhattan Project, which developed the first nuclear weapons. Wisely, Nolan doesn't lay out the chronology in a straightforward manner. Like his Memento, the material becomes more compelling when the timeline is complicated. In Oppenheimer, three narratives are interwoven. The first is in 1954, when a fifty-something Oppenheimer faces a security hearing, his past being dredged up and twisted before a board of vultures from the United States Atomic Energy Commission, hungry for his ruin. The second occurs in 1959, when shoe salesman turned political powerhouse Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) is rehashing his involvement with Oppenheimer during a confirmation hearing for President Eisenhower's cabinet. The third is the story of Oppenheimer's love of physics and mercurial women, and how the former led to the building of the A-bomb and the horrific bombings of Japan's Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.  Across a story that spans decades, Nolan folds in hordes of real figures, casting them with a fleet of stars including: Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchian, Jack Quaid, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, James D'Arcy, Tony Goldwyn, Alex Wolff, and Kenneth Branagh. Basically, a flood of critically acclaimed white male actors, and then a sprinkling of heralded actresses — Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt — playing a pair of Nolan's sexy but dangerously temperamental women.  Nolan has long been criticized for his shallow depictions of women, who are typically sultry and smart, but tragic — like sulking (and often fridged) wives of The Prestige, Inception, and Memento. In Oppenheimer, Olivia Thirlby has a small role as scientist Lilli Hornig, who worked on the Manhattan Project, and so escapes this archetype. Meanwhile, Pugh, one of the most talented actresses of her generation, is reduced to weeping and nudity, despite playing Jean Tatloc, a politically influential psychiatrist with her own story to tell. Meanwhile, Blunt plays Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty, a belligerent drunk whose scenes predominantly see her pep-talking her husband or berating her yowling baby, with her one moment of redemption being captivatingly catty with one of his many enemies.  Nolan's women often showcase emotions his male characters are too repressed to express. So is the case here, where Oppenheimer's lovers come off as hysterical in the face of his unshakeable stoicism. Murphy is intriguing in the lead role, of a man whose imagination and scientific know-how torment him with the terrible possibilities of mankind and the universe. But Nolan rejects the showboating exhibitionism of emotion that many a Hollywood historical epic would favor. Instead, Göransson's score barrels into the film, persistently, giving a booming voice to Oppenheimer's fears, brewing dread, and moral horror, where the character dare not flinch.  This score, paired with a relentlessly propulsive edit from Jennifer Lame (Tenet, Blonde, Don't Worry Darling), makes the first two and twenty minutes of Nolan's three-hour film blaze by. However, Nolan grows indulgent, piling up examples of the evidence hurled at his eponymous protagonist, and in the last leg, Oppenheimer begins to drag. Its hero's dedicatedly restrained persona is no help here, offering diminishing returns as the movie becomes increasingly about men arguing over boardroom tables. To Nolan's credit, this banal situation stays interesting for much longer than one might think on paper. But my patience wore thin as the director gave into one of his favorite indulgences: a bleeding soundscape.  The music, which screams with strings, horns, and even Geiger counter noise, is sensational in its swelling but also is used without remorse throughout Oppenheimer. In a montage sequence where Oppenheimer and his colleague, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), build their crew of top scientists for the Los Alamos-based project, the music is so dominant, so booming that it becomes near impossible to make out what some of the characters are saying. (Similar complaints were made about Tenet.) This becomes a recurring issue in Oppenheimer.  Likely by design, the specifics of scientific talk or character motivations are drowned out by the score, perhaps reflecting Nolan's impatience with these details or his trust that the audience will get the gist and follow the BRAAAAAHMMMMMM of the audioscape.  Nolan's got a skill for cast and bringing together epic ensembles, and Oppenheimer is no exception. Praise will rightly be poured on a lot of the cast members: Downey Jr. sheds the slick Tony Stark swagger to play a compelling cagey politician. Blunt brings bite to a role that is woefully two-dimensional, yet fun to watch because of her verve. David Krumholtz is a solid scene-stealer as physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi, bringing in a mischievousness and humility that many of his scientist's onscreen colleagues lack. David Dastmalchian is satisfyingly grim as a fearsome foe with an ax to grind. Murphy will no doubt be heralded — perhaps by the Academy too — for his reserved yet largely riveting portrayal of a complicated man. (That Oppenheimer falls into the trap of behaving like it's only male geniuses who are complicated can not be blamed on Murphy). However, Matt Damon proved to be the most surprising and thrilling performer in the bunch.  As the general bullying about the scientists of Los Alamos, he's a jarring breath of fresh air. Where they ponder and speak with clever poetry and sophistication, he speaks bluntly with no concern for hurt feelings or wounded egos, and so nearly every one of his lines hits like a punchline. It's brazen and bizarrely funny in the midst of so much darkness. But the comic relief here is more than that. Damon's general is also one of the chief symbols of the danger of nationalism in Oppenheimer. His resolute attitude and bravado become as much a red flag as an amusement. It's one of Nolan's subtler, yet most effective political statements within the film.  Unquestionably, Nolan's tackling a massively ambitious endeavor with Oppenheimer, unfurling a story that not only includes dozens of characters, decades of real events, complicated political debates, and dizzying scientific explanations. He aims to propel it through star power, character study, and a literally seat-rattling score. But for all the historic name-dropping and scenes of debate about the bomb's intentions and its impact, there's a disturbing omission: Japan.  On one hand, showing the devastation that the atomic bomb had on Japan and its people might have risked turning real-life human horror into gaudy summer spectacle. In Oppenheimer, the devastation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is discussed in statistics of the dead and terse descriptions of their agony. At one point, Oppenheimer goes to a lecture, where a slideshow of the fallout is shown, but Nolan keeps it offscreen, focusing instead on Murphy's expression, which is restrained but presumably remorseful.  The closest Oppenheimer gets to visualizing the human cost of the bomb is when its protagonist imagines what would happen if it hit during the pep rally he's speaking at, where the crowd is cheering his name. A flash of light. The skin of a white woman's face peels away as she applauds. Oppenheimer imagines stepping — not just on but through — a charred corpse, curled up at his feet. It's a glimpse into this nightmare that haunted the bomb's makers, but was much more to the Japanese, who are not represented in any way within the film. In the end, Oppenheimer is unsettling. It's supposed to be with its aim to reignite the conversation around nuclear weapons and their seeming guarantee of mutually assured destruction. But beyond that very concerning thesis, Nolan seems less aware of the tiresome tropes and troubling choices his film makes, which puts white men at the center of the conversation and its fringes while making all others into distraction or collateral damage.  Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.

"Jul 19, 2023"," The life of New York-born Jewish theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer is explored in this breathtaking biopic from The Prestige and Inception director Christopher Nolan. The film is an adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin about the theoretical physicist who Time Magazine nicknamed the “father of the atom bomb”.  After being recruited to work on producing a new weapon against Hitler’s Nazi army at the tail end of WW2, J Robert Oppenheimer (played by Irish actor Cillian Murphy) finds himself caught in a whirlwind of doubt and guilt as he weighs up the consequences of his new invention. Caught between the love of two women - his wife Kitty is played by Emily Blunt, while his troubled communist lover Jean is gorgeously depicted by Florence Pugh - Robert is also seduced by extreme left-wing ideas without ever committing himself to be a member of the American Communist party.  Oppenheimer’s life starts to unravel after the war when two atom bombs are dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing and maiming thousands of innocent civilians. Now questioning the need for further research in weapons of mass destruction, Robert becomes persona non grata in Washington and is later questioned for his ""unpatriotic"" political views.  This is Nolan’s most ambitious and best film to date and, if I’m really being honest, I doubt very much that we are likely to see a better film being released in 2023. There is depth to Nolan’s direction and vision for this biopic that feels like a love letter to cinema in its purest form. Bolstered by a suitably ominous score by Tenet and Black Panther composer Ludwig Göransson and by Hoyte Van Hoytema’s glorious cinematography, Oppenheimer marks a spectacular achievement for cinema. In it, Nolan pushes every single boundary there is, without the use of a single CGI rendered shot. It is simply stunning to look at and is likely to leave anyone in awe of its achievements.  With a cast made up of some of the brightest and most accomplished actors working in Hollywood right now, the film could have easily turned into a cameo-laden extravaganza. Instead, Nolan is able to justify each and every single casting, even the most surprising ones. Murphy is surely a shoo-in for a best actor nod at the Oscars next year, as is Robert Downey Jr whose depiction of former American politician Lewis Strauss is just beyond impeccable and is sure to translate into a best supporting actor nomination.  This is truly the best film of the year and Nolan’s best work to date. I cannot wait to see it again and again and again.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Early on in Oppenheimer, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) explains to a student that physics can often be paradoxical. Christopher Nolan's latest movie is also paradoxical — it is probably Nolan's masterpiece, as the acclaimed director is at the top of his game, but when movie fans look back on his career it doesn't seem likely anyone will claim it as their favorite of his work. Nolan has taken his trademark ability to weave together multiple timelines in the story to reveal the life of Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, and combined it with an extra layer of artistry to effectively portray the tormented soul of the man who made one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs ever that at the same time resulted in so much death and fear of future destruction. Entertaining is not the right word to describe Oppenheimer, but it is a truly engrossing movie that you won't be able to look away from for its entire three-hour run time. No time is wasted on diving right into the story. We meet a young Oppenheimer as he works on his studies and role in establishing the field of quantum physics, while also learning about his flirtation with communism and close association with more actual communists in the late 1920s/early 1930s. Simultaneously we see Oppenheimer put under the microscope for his past affiliations years after the events of the Manhattan Project and Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) speaking in front of Congress trying to be confirmed for a Cabinet position where Oppenheimer is a key subject. It's at least half-an-hour into the movie before we even get to Oppenheimer becoming involved with the atomic bomb. There is a lot to take in and it comes at you fast, leaving the chance that some details or lines of dialogue can be missed (be warned, stepping out for a bathroom break could result in you missing quite a bit). All of this means that multiple viewings are required to grasp every nuance of the story and Nolan's depiction of it, but that's standard procedure for a Nolan movie. To be honest, despite its overall dour message, I would willingly sit down to watch Oppenheimer again right now. A big reason for that is because there are few filmmakers who are as skilled craftsmen as Nolan is right now. Oppenheimer is a stunningly beautiful movie to look at. The screening I saw in 70mm was incredible, but the work of Nolan and cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema will undoubtedly look great in any format. And the much hyped, non-CGI explosion of the bomb is a sight to behold; a fraction of what it must have been like for those scientists in real-life but jaw-dropping and humbling in this recreation. There are a number of stylistic choices as well employed that add to the complexity of Oppenheimer's character and what he goes through. Playing around with the background shaking, audio cues of explosions and screams, blinding light and more help emphasize the turmoil of Oppenheimer and what his work has wrought. Of course, all of that can only reach its full potential in tandem with the performance of Murphy, which is some of the Irish actor's best work of his career. Emily Blunt is also exceptional in the role of Kitty Oppenheimer. Still for my money, the standout performance belongs to Downey, who effectively manages to serve as a kind of narrator while also portraying a gripping character in his own right; it's the first great non-Iron Man performance from Downey in a long time. There is a massive ensemble beyond those three. Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz and Jason Clarke have a bit more to work with for their characters, while others — Tony Goldwyn, Kenneth Branagh, Tom Conti, Matthew Modine, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirlby, Casey Affleck, Gary Oldman and more — have what basically amount to little more than cameos, but they're contributions to the movie are no less appreciated. Oppenheimer is clearly a story that Nolan felt he needed to tell. The departing message is not subtle, but because Nolan is in pique form, everything that came before prevents that from cheapening the moment. An apt comparison is probably Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, as each director stepped away from the more popcorn-centric fare they are known for but used their incomparable skills to deliver powerful true stories that needed to be told. Very few people are going to be rewatching Oppenheimer for the fun of it like they do Nolan's The Dark Knight, Inception or The Prestige; even Dunkirk had more thrilling, crowd-pleasing moments. Still, this is one of the movies that Christopher Nolan is going to be remembered for, further cementing him as one of the greatest directors of his generation. There's been nothing else like it in movie theaters for quite some time and there probably won't be again for a while, so you won't want to miss it.

"Jul 19, 2023"," 
Christopher Nolan is obsessed with time. He has reversed it in Tenet, layered it in Inception, been adrift in it in Interstellar, and traveled through it at three different velocities in Dunkirk. He manipulates it both for characters and audiences with equal ease, but in Oppenheimer â his biography of the father of the atomic bomb â he does both simultaneously.
 
It's 1924, and a young J. Robert Oppenheimer quits Cambridge to study the new discipline of quantum physics in Germany: a decision that ultimately leads to him running the Manhattan Project, America's World War II rush to build a functioning atomic bomb. It's 1954, and Oppenheimer is in a small room in Washington, D.C., facing a kangaroo court predetermined to confirm suspicions that he was a Red. It is 1958, and commerce secretary nominee Lewis Strauss is facing a brutal Senate confirmation hearing over his advocacy for the now-disgraced Oppenheimer. These three interlocked narratives are sheathed within each other, information being recontextualized backward and forward, entangled at a quantum level.
 
What bonds them is Oppenheimer, scintillatingly and sympathetically portrayed by Murphy in a performance of breathtaking understatement and perspicacity. Without ever resorting to exposition or flagellant self-examination, he probes the complexities of a man who saw the workings of the cosmos on an almost instinctual level (one must wonder if Nolan, who seems to have a similar relationship with temporal mechanics as a narrative tool, feels a certain kinship). Yet he's not a dry academic, or the cryptic tool of the military-industrial complex as which he has been caricatured. Oppenheimer is presented as a revolutionary, part of an interwar era of music and art and philosophy and science that was redefining existence. Yet he's never portrayed as a solitary genius burdened with eureka moments. Instead, Murphy gently inhabits a man who saw problems at macro and micro levels simultaneously, and so was able to understand both the grand plan of the Manhattan Project and also how to put people in place to deploy their own genius.
 
Nolan's script (adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin's epic 2005 biography, American Prometheus) truly centers on Oppenheimer's relationships. That includes his penchant for affairs, such as the catastrophic carnal connection with Jean Tatlock (a furious and tormented Pugh) and the more scandalous one with Kitty Harrison (Blunt, capturing the steel that it must have taken to contend with Oppenheimer). Swirling around them is a perfect ensemble cast of researchers, many of them icons of science: Branagh as Bohr, Conti heartbreaking as the aged Einstein, and a lugubrious performance by Benny Safdie (Uncut Gems) as Edward Teller. The brilliance goes down to the tiniest moments: There's an undeniable delicious charm to having Venture Brothers actor James Urbaniak as logician Kurt GÃ¶del, or knowing that having Jack Quaid just playing bongos will indicate that he's Richard Feynman, the future physicist of the beat generation.
 
The people around Oppenheimer are his strength and his weakness, as Nolan's script subtly indicates how his pre-war political naivety and basic humanism were used against him by Hoover's commie-smashing FBI. Grand betrayal is an elemental component of the story, and this being Nolan, that cinema is indeed grand. Yes, the Trinity test sequence is a nail-biting feat of cinematic tension, but he deploys the same epic filmmaking to the smallest of moments. He subtly recalibrates how the audience sees Oppenheimer's world, with seemingly constant particulate matter, whether it be dust or snow, drifting across vistas, highlighting the micro as part of the macro. Oppenheimer's visions are as ear-shattering and eye-scorching as the Trinity test itself.
 
But most importantly, Oppenheimer charts the man as he goes from seeing his theories of electrons and neutrinos become an inferno of reality. It's all power: not just nuclear, but political and interpersonal, as Oppenheimer goes from the cover of Time magazine to internal exile. Rarely have the highs and lows of politics been so astoundingly charted. The slowly revealed duet between Murphy and Downey Jr. as Strauss is even more enthralling because the pair â both utterly masterful in their roles â rarely shares the screen. But in a way, Oppenheimer is like atomic physics: Each tiny spark interlocks to create a massive, breathtaking, terrifying conflagration.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Filmmaker Christopher Nolan has presented us with so many dark splendors and unsettling displays of destruction in his career — in science fiction, in Gotham City or in “Dunkirk,” his first real-world historical thriller. Now we have “Oppenheimer,” his second in that real-world category. People will be talking about it for a long time; they already are, largely because of what it’s not: not a sequel, not an overbudgeted franchise product, not junk. It’s Nolan’s most haunted film to date, and with this subject — J. Robert Oppenheimer, theoretical physicist, “father of the atom bomb,” anguished, conscience-stricken victim of America’s errantly shifting political winds — a filmmaker cannot treat the sight, and the fallout, of the dawn of our catastrophic nuclear age as mere spectacle. Well, they can. But it’d be a mistake. It stars a pitch-perfect Cillian Murphy as the thin man in the famously oversized fedora, with Nolan freely adapting Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s superb Oppenheimer 2006 biography “American Prometheus.” Nolan establishes back-and-forth timelines here, far less showily than in “Dunkirk.” (Fine by me; I found that film’s time-signature riddles to be facile in the extreme.) On one track in “Oppenheimer,” we follow young Robert as he races through the 1920s, coping with depression, discovering sex and women, chasing after quantum physics and bringing that exotic new branch of theoretical inquiry back to America from Europe. A post-World War II timeline intertwines throughout. We see Oppenheimer fighting for his reputational life at the nadir of the anti-Communist McCarthy era. Robert Downey Jr., plainly relieved to get the hell away from Marvel green-screens for a while, portrays Atomic Energy Commission director Lewis Strauss, an old political nemesis of Oppenheimer’s, depicted as the cautionary tale’s cold-blooded antagonist. Oppenheimer claimed he never was an official Communist Party member, but he circulated at the University of California-Berkeley among plenty of Communist friends and causes, with his troubled lover Jean  Tatlock (Florence Pugh) a party member, and Oppenheimer’s troubled wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), a onetime party member as well. Nolan probably could have taken the time to explore more of what was behind that adjective “troubled,” but there it is. Oppenheimer’s leftist beliefs made his rather unlikely leadership of the secret Los Alamos, New Mexico project during the war a dicey proposition, but one that his boss, Gen. Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), sent through the channels. From a scientific and militarily strategic standpoint, it worked out beautifully; the U.S. got what it wanted, and it seemed (or so Oppenheimer said in the heat of the race to beat the Nazis) a simple, momentous challenge. Already by 1939, Germany had split the atom; if Hitler hadn’t dismissed nuclear physics and atomic weaponry as “Jewish science,” likely giving the Jewish Oppenheimer and the Los Alamos project time enough to develop and test the bomb in summer 1945, who knows how things would’ve gone? How they went was horrific enough, and this is where “Oppenheimer” soars. Throughout the movie, Nolan and editor Jennifer Lame zap the audience with images of what Oppenheimer’s theories and imagination fire in his mind’s eye — images of electricity, fission, infernos of doom. The bomb test sequence at Los Alamos — Nolan re-creates the stunning sight and sound of its detonation, the sound and the blast arriving a full 100 seconds afterward —  marshals everything Nolan has learned as a filmmaker. He craves intensity and screw-tightening; crucially, in “Oppenheimer,” he knows just when to strip it bare, and pull the audience in through other means. The cast is enormous, with dozens of politicians, scientists, and academics darting in and out of the story, with especially intriguing work from a variety of weaselly D.C. operatives (Dane DeHaan as Strauss’ whipping boy Nichols, Casey Affleck as the quietly murderous Pash). The scene where President Truman, played in a quick-and-dirty cameo by Gary Oldman, meets Oppenheimer and can’t fathom the man admitting he feels as though he has “blood on his hands” is true, or true enough, anyway, in Nolan’s telling. What’s missing from the script, I think, is a fuller sense of Oppenheimer’s paradoxical, quizzical, tic-laden personality. Murphy’s first-rate, but on the page this is a rather smooth-edged depiction of a singular character caught in epically fraught circumstances. Pugh and Blunt excel, too, though only in brief bits and pieces; the boozy, violent extremes of the Oppenheimer marriage (and the fate of their daughter) remain outside Nolan’s preferred and very busy timelines. It may be serious and important stuff, but Nolan sacrifices none of his cinematic instincts for tension- and momentum-building. That’s sometimes for the best, and sometimes not. The musical score by Ludwig Göransson never gives us a break, in a style akin to Hans Zimmer’s all-out assault in “Dunkirk.” More than anything this kind of scoring is hell on the actors; late in “Oppenheimer,” Blunt and Jason Clarke engage in a ripping verbal exchange during Oppenheimer’s Atomic Energy Commission security board hearing, but the music keeps grinding and grinding and you half-expect Blunt to call time out. I wonder if Nolan subconsciously (or consciously) favors multiple layers of screw-tightening, visual and aural, with scripts risking an overload of exposition as this one does. He’s an elegant and extremely clever structuralist; in “Oppenheimer,” Nolan is also trying to honor and dramatize as much of his subject’s burdens as three hours can handle. The results are pretty gripping and occasionally brilliant; its peaks, particularly when Nolan suddenly changes gears, cuts out the sound and reveals the full weight of Oppenheimer’s tormented psyche, reach higher than anything this filmmaker has scaled to date. Such scenes, awful and beautiful, have no need for words. And Nolan takes care of Job No. 1: This is a film about terrible risks and a planet likely destined to destroy itself someday. And we see it, and feel it.",POSITIVE

"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan has a reputation for ‘event’ moviemaking thanks to past successes including Inception, the Dark Knight trilogy and Interstellar, so expectations for Oppenheimer are exceedingly high. Oppenheimer finds the writer-director-producer back in a true-to-life historical setting, following 2017’s Dunkirk, but it’s the first time he has dipped his toe in the waters of a biopic – or his version of one, anyway. Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, American Prometheus, Oppenheimer focuses on what became the scientist’s life’s work as the ‘father of the atomic bomb’. The clashing spheres of the military and academia naturally create a high-stakes backdrop to the movie as Oppenheimer (played with searing but totally natural intensity by Cillian Murphy) is given the position of director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. It’s here that acts as the practical home of the secretive Manhattan Project, as the US raced to become the first country to produce nuclear weapons against both their enemy, Nazi Germany, and their shaky ally, Russia. As expected (and hoped for), Nolan has produced a taut and twisty intelligent blockbuster that asks its audience to think along with the film. However, he never quite tips over into the realms of overly complex or intellectual – this is mainly down to the riveting character study he and Murphy present of Oppenheimer, and the pace and panache with which other figures enter and exit his life.  And the list there really is extensive, containing everyone from Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon to Jason Clarke, Sir Kenneth Branagh, David Krumholtz, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Dane DeHann, Rami Malek and Benny Safdie – it’s a smorgasbord of talent. The film is engaging, even over its three-hour running time – which genuinely feels more like two – and it’s an intoxicating trait of Nolan’s that he treats his audience like they have brains ready to exercise. Naturally, the writing is tight and well-judged, breaking the tension occasionally with thoroughly realistic jokes (they are dealing with the pressure of building a nuclear bomb, after all) and although it’s a biographical first as a film for Nolan, he still does it his way. Therefore, there are multiple timelines to juggle and gorgeous abstract shots ruminating on black holes courtesy of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Murphy is exceptional in the role of Oppenheimer, finally having his blockbuster leading man moment once more after his earlier work with Danny Boyle in 28 Days Later and Sunshine. Nolan has expertly picked his moment and main part to give to Murphy after a multiple-movie association. He is arrogant and dismissive yet charmingly flawed and human, never alienating viewers. Obviously, a large part of Oppenheimer that’s anticipated is the film showing a study in regret following the events of August 1945, when the US opted to detonate two of their newly-finished nuclear bombs over Japan. However, Nolan opts for less handwringing than you might expect. There is a powerful scene around Oppenheimer’s imagined impact of his creations but his burden seems less of a driving force than expected, which sits slightly oddly with a modern audience. Alongside Murphy, Damon and Downey Jr have the next most critical roles, with Damon providing a little welcome comic relief in his straight-talking role as Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project. Downey Jr plays Lewis Strauss, whose fate intertwines with Oppenheimer’s over the course of their careers, and he is here to remind fans that he can do far more than just Tony Stark’s easy arrogance. As a multifaceted foil to Murphy, his complex performance makes him the other actor alongside the film’s lead who should be clearing space on his awards shelf. That is not to take away from the rest of the outstanding ensemble either – and it truly is a colossal cast – with a welcome return for Hartnett as Oppenheimer’s friend Ernest Lawrence, a glorified but superb cameo for Gary Oldman as President Truman and an earnest turn from David Krumholtz as another long-time friend, Isidor Rabi. There are many other recognisable faces that pop up and it’s thrilling to see Tom Conti’s take on Albert Einstein and the complicated relationship he shared with Oppenheimer. Best Actor Oscar-winner Malek even has scenes without lines, but eventually gets his moment to shine. The only fly in Oppenheimer’s ointment is its undeserving of female characters and actresses Emily Blunt (Kitty Oppenheimer) and – in particular – Florence Pugh (Jean Tatlock), who spends most of her time topless and/or arguing with Murphy and that’s it. Yes, the film is a biopic about Oppenheimer but a little more context to these women before they are both very quickly thrust into relationships with ‘Oppy’ that only seem to bring out the absolute worst in them, would have been welcome. There’s so little to them other than their reactions to him that it’s faintly embarrassing. However, both still give nuanced performances, naturally, and Blunt’s penultimate scene demonstrates exactly why she would have said yes to this role. It (almost) goes without saying that Oppenheimer must be seen in the cinema – in 70mm if at all possible – as Nolan hoped and intended, given that he offers us the visual and intellectual spectacle that he does. It’s curious too that, just like its summer blockbuster sibling Barbie, Oppenheimer revolves around tackling what it’s like to be human but in a very, very different way.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s latest is both a trippy action movie and an immersive biopic. Running a full three hours, it is a provocative and sometimes sexually graphic portrait of the troubled physicist who oversaw the creation of the atomic bomb. Nolan is known for his dark visions, but this is the most profoundly pessimistic work yet. That said, Oppenheimer – which is as intimate and tender as Nolan’s early masterpiece Memento – is frequently very funny. If we’re still alive in 2024 (and the movie suggests imminent destruction is closer than we think) it should clean up at the Oscars. The script is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus, and gives 47-year-old Cillian Murphy, who’s never played the lead in a blockbuster, the role of his career. We follow the New York-born Oppenheimer from Cambridge student to old man, (though not chronologically; the editing is fast, furious and, ultimately, mind-blowing). As played by Murphy, “Oppie” widens his pretty blue eyes, flashes an electric smile and has a gentle, measured, hypnotically soothing voice. A charming and ambitious polymath, he’s put in charge of the Los Alamos-based Manhattan Project, and races to save the world from the Nazis. Yet, Oppenheimer can also be hypocritical, arrogant, cowardly, narcissistic and, when he fancies it, disloyal. For a genius, he’s capable of being a real dummy, too. He thinks he has the measure of the conservative politicians and army guys trying to ensure the Soviets don’t derail this mission impossible. He’s wrong. The building, and testing, of the bomb dominates the middle section of the movie, which contains a shocking act, sweaty suspense and top banter (Matt Damon, as a wryly no-nonsense army officer is on fine form; ditto Emily Blunt, as Oppenheimer’s frustrated wife, Kitty). We get colossal bang for our buck, and the horrific consequences for the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are heard and seen (though not in the way you might expect). In the third act, Nolan finds a unique way to tackle Oppenheimer’s remorse (both with regard to the A-bombs and his lover Jean Tatlock, played by Florence Pugh). Instead of watching him wring his hands, we’re forced to pay attention to the outcome of two unofficial trials. One takes place in 1954, during the “second Red Scare”, and sees Oppenheimer’s reputation on the line. The other, held in 1959, revolves around a one-time acquaintance of Oppenheimer’s, U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, Lewis Strauss (a sublime Robert Downey Jr). What interests Nolan: how easy it is to lose sight of the bigger picture, a crime that both of these men are guilty of. This filmmaker is back on track. Though impeccably shot and acted, the much-lauded Dunkirk was overblown, while Tenet tried too hard to be clever. Oppenheimer (which again features Kenneth Branagh) avoids those pitfalls, the antithesis of a self-regarding, bigger-equals-better prestige project.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan, the revered father figure of Film Twitter Bros the world over, has made his Mank (or his JFK, depending on who you ask.) Much like David Fincher’s polarizing and 10-time Oscar-nominated biopic, Oppenheimer offers a sprawling and contemplative portrayal of technology that reshaped the world, all while navigating the invasive presence of McCarthyism in America. It presents a sprawling, intricately layered narrative reminiscent of a Russian Nesting Doll, with stories within stories and a dynamic interplay of multiple timelines, including both colorized and black-and-white sequences, complemented by an ensemble cast of A-list actors. Those who caught early screening have already flocked to Twitter to lob terms like “masterpiece” and “best of the century” at Nolan’s three-hour biopic about the Father of the Atom Bomb but, much like Mank, Oppenheimer sees a celebrated filmmaker delivers a work seemingly tailored for awards recognition, though very clearly near and dear to him, yet ultimately fails to ignite the explosive impact it promises. Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer with a screenplay from Nolan that’s based on Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s 2005 biography ‘American Prometheus’. Joining him is an impressive ensemble of A-list talent including Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, and Kenneth Branagh. But this large cast of characters too often lack depth and complexity, shuffling in and out of the fold without making much of a mark.  Nolan has always struggled to create meaningful human relationships in his films, particularly romantic ones, championing complex narrative webs over genuine human connection, and that is  true here. For example, Oppenheimer is cast as a womanizer and though we see him with multiple women throughout the course of the film, we never get a sense of what drives him into the arms of other women, what the nature of their relationship is, or find anything representing heat in their exchanges. Oppenheimer‘s portrayal of its titular character emphasizes his icy demeanor, understated brilliance, and a noticeable lack of sexual passion. Murphy is solid here: haunted, distant, hollow: but such a remote performance can be challenging to invest in, especially with Nolan rendering the rest of the film so unintentionally cold to the touch. While the film carries an R-rating for nudity and sexuality, Nolan’s direction renders the overall experience devoid of nuclear heat, emotionally distant, and sexually frigid.  As we navigate the shifting timelines and attempt to follow the numerous relationships, Oppenheimer becomes a demanding and arduous experience. It succumbs to the notion of ‘more is more’ without offering substantial improvements. This becomes particularly evident in the initial hour, where the narrative juggles four distinct time periods—Oppenheimer’s college days, his post-A-bomb professorship, and two separate trials. The overwhelming sense is that the film could have benefited from a more focused editorial approach, allowing for significant trimming without sacrificing crucial content.  While Oppenheimer does feature a few truly brilliant moments – the Trinity Bomb test is a stunningly assembled sequence, as is a later scene where Oppenheimer finds himself walloped by the reality of what he has unleashed upon the world – they are often overshadowed by the excesses of the narrative, ultimately resulting in a rather tedious viewing experience. The fact that the movie reaches its narrative climax with an hour of runtime remaining is a testament to the need for stricter editing on Nolan’s part.  There was chatter that Oppenheimer was Nolan’s “horror movie” and though that is an exciting prospect, it’s not really true. I’d hesitate to even call this a thriller, despite the presence of Ludwig Göransson’s tension-wracked score, one full of bombast and intensity, which suggests that we’re watching a thriller, doing its best to lift hours of board room conversations into something actually exciting. Which too often, Oppenheimer is not. There’s a good movie in here but Oppenheimer suffers from the burden of cramming a handful of different eras into one narrative, detracting from its overall impact by virtue of being too busy and showy. Nolan’s decision to fracture the story and present it non-linearly lacks justification, as there isn’t much here that validates his opting for the narrative fragmentation that worked so well in Dunkirk. It’s fancy filmmaking for the sake of being noticeable and only succeeds in creating an alienating and emotionally distant experience. Oppenheimer will have its devotees – and appears to already – but it’s hardly going to light the world on fire.  CONCLUSION: In his latest endeavor, ‘Oppenheimer’, Christopher Nolan presents a dense, sprawling, and isolating biopic that, unfortunately, veers towards excessive tedium, often obscuring moments of true magnificence within its labyrinthine narrative.  When not plugging away at his computer, Matt can be found holed up in his Seattle home or hidden amongst the mountains.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan was never going to make a straightforward biopic of the father of the atomic bomb and so his eponymously titled film about J Robert Oppenheimer proves. Deploying his virtuosic grasp of non-linear storytelling, he transforms Oppenheimer from the dry, talky film it could have been into an urgent, intensely cinematic and thoroughly engrossing apocalyptic thriller. That’s something he didn’t quite pull off with his sci-fi palindrome Tenet, though the two make interesting companion pieces, not least because Tenet specifically referenced Oppenheimer as part of its outré plot exploring whether or not it’s possible to unmake a catastrophic mistake. That theme is really the key to understanding Oppenheimer, played here by Nolan regular Cillian Murphy, whose gaunt frame and sunken cheeks give him the haunted look of someone who has definitely “known sin.” The film sets him up as Promethean figure, a flawed genius who harnessed the destructive power of the universe, only to be tormented by his choices and persecuted for his work by the very government who put him in charge of the Manhattan Project. Nolan teases this out by jumping back and forth in the timeline of Oppenheimer’s life, though the underlying structure itself is fairly simple, with the first half charting the race against time to create and test the first atomic bomb and the second half delving more deeply into the fallout from that operation. The narrative through-line is really Oppenheimer’s gradual realisation that the war he signed on to fight against the Nazis is actually being transformed by his government into a covert war against the Soviet Union, an ideological shift that makes his earlier career as a free-thinking academic with left-leaning politics more problematic. Among the heavyweight supporting cast, there are meaty performances from Matt Damon as Oppenheimer’s Pentagon superior Leslie Groves and Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s frequently soused, but formidable, second wife Kitty. There’s also a slippery role for Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, the one-time chair of the Atomic Energy Committee whose story Nolan uses as an additional framing device. Then there’s Florence Pugh, electrifying as Oppenheimer’s first wife Jean Tatlock, though quite what we’re supposed to make of her sex scene – in which Oppenheimer translates the Sanskrit text of the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita, for her mid-coitus – is anyone’s guess. “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” he announces as Jean climaxes. All that’s missing is a crude cutaway to a mushroom cloud. Speaking of which, the testing of the bomb provides the film with its midpoint money shot and it’s among the best things Nolan has done, an immersive, unbearably tense set-piece that makes innovative use of silence to help convey the awesome power of what they’ve unleashed. It’s followed by an even better scene in which the consequences of what Oppenheimer has accomplished registers in his mind in the middle of a victory speech to his colleagues. Jubilation quickly turns to judgment as the carnage the A-Bomb will soon inflict on Hiroshima and Nagasaki bleeds from the future into the present via hallucinatory images of flaying skin, charcoal remains and the ash of incinerated bodies. Some mistakes can’t be unmade. “Now I am become Barbie, the destroyer of worlds”, could be the jokey Oppenheimer-esque tagline to Barbie, Greta Gerwig’s much-hyped film about the pop-culture-conquering doll whose weird history as a frenemy of feminism provides what little substance there is to this DayGlo disappointment. Less a movie than a collection of meme-able moments, its much-hoped-for subversion amounts to few gentle digs at the film’s corporate paymasters folded into a derivative story in which “Stereotypical Barbie” (played by Margot Robbie) undergoes an existential awakening that forces her to leave Barbieland and enter the real world. There she’s soon horrified to discover that women aren’t in charge and all the positive and inspiring messages she thought Barbies were providing little girls have instead had a detrimental effect. Though initially this suggests the film is going to have some bite, Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach don’t really follow through. Abandoning the internal logic of a promising premise that ties the interior life of Barbie to the way she’s played with in the real world, they fall back instead on heavily ironic fish-out-of-water gags and insider jokes about cancelled toy-lines and absent genitalia, all the while inuring the film against criticism with lots of wink-wink meta-commentary designed to make people who don’t fall in line with the film’s blanket marketing campaign feel like spoilsports. Part of the frustration, though, comes from the fact that its high concept ideas have already been done to death in the likes of The Lego Movie, Enchanted, The Truman Show and even last year’s underrated Don’t Worry Darling, to which this film often feels like a perky flip-side, especially when poor dimwit Ken (Ryan Gosling) discovers something called “patriarchy” and, through sheer dumb luck, manages to remake Barbieland in his own image. Barbie may be scratching at something interesting in satirising the easy ride mediocre men have in the world, but it’s also one of the bigger ironies that it only really comes alive as a movie when Ken gains some agency and Gosling is allowed to cut loose. He gets the lion’s share of the laughs – though at the packed screening I attended even these were intermittent and forced. As for Robbie, while perfectly cast, it’s just a shame her character arc is so insipid, filled as it is with feminist-sounding platitudes and, at one point, a plea for an ordinary Barbie, something this film, sadly, has no trouble delivering.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," A brilliant, restless, obsessive figure, impossible to fathom in full: this description could fairly be applied to the American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atom bomb, both the real man and the version cagily portrayed by Cillian Murphy in the new film by Christopher Nolan. Something comparable might be said of Nolan, though the differences are as notable as the resemblances. Oppenheimer, according to one of his lovers, was so precocious he “never had a childhood”. Nolan has hardly needed to grow up, having built his career as an entertainer on subjects that might be expected to interest a bright 12-year-old: war, superheroes, time paradoxes, magic tricks, things that go bang. Considering the grand scale of Nolan’s ambitions, his sensibility can feel almost grotesquely limited. Yet, he’s always had the knack of undermining his grandiosity from within. From The Prestige to his Batman trilogy to the wilfully incomprehensible Tenet, he’s made movies about men neurotically determined to leave their mark, through creation or destruction or both. The latest in the series, Oppenheimer is on one level a traditional Great Man biopic, albeit more wedded to the facts than most (the starting point for Nolan’s script was Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s doorstopper 2005 biography American Prometheus). Gaunt and shock-haired, with depths of alarm in his big blue eyes, Murphy as the young Oppenheimer is everybody’s idea of a tortured genius – though there’s no denying the real man looked somewhat like this, and was indeed the sort of polymath capable of learning Sanskrit in his spare time for fun. Dozens of well-known actors file past as prominent scientists and politicians of the mid-20th century, from Tom Conti’s cuddly Einstein to Gary Oldman as an unusually malevolent Harry Truman. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, as the two main women in the hero’s life, are minor players at best: even Pugh’s hyped nude scene is mainly a way of showing her character and Oppenheimer remain sexually involved without slowing down the conveyor belt of exposition. As with many an old-fashioned epic, Oppenheimer is composed largely of solemn scenes of men in rooms making speeches – as dry as any historical miniseries you had to sit through in high school, though more fleetly edited. To some extent, the willingness to risk tedium is to Nolan’s credit: it would be too much to claim you’ll leave knowing more about quantum physics, but you’ll probably be better informed about Oppenheimer’s political views, which were left-wing enough to occasion the revoking of his security clearance in 1954. The confidential hearing leading to this decision supplies the film’s framework, with Oppenheimer recounting his life story from the stand – although Nolan characteristically complicates the time scheme further via flash-forwards centred on the sometime Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss (an aged-up Robert Downey jnr, who gets to do more showboating than anyone else, with Matt Damon running a close second as Oppenheimer’s gruff wartime boss). Just as characteristic is the ambiguity of the ultimate message. If you wandered in at the right moment, you could see this as a piece of old-fashioned liberal uplift about an intellectual dynamo who overcomes anti-Semitism and his demons in time to help ensure the safety of the free world, then becomes the victim of a witch-hunt for having taken advantage of that freedom (as the script indicates, while Oppenheimer had Communist ties in the 1930s, there’s no firm evidence he was ever a party member). But lurking behind the prosy biopic conventions is a touch of Kafka: just because a man is unfairly accused doesn’t mean he isn’t guilty in a deeper sense. Likewise, there’s something of Kafka’s imaginary America in the depiction of Los Alamos, where the first nuclear tests took place. The desert town built to house the scientists is almost like a film set – and Oppenheimer, glowering under his broad-brimmed hat, is like an uncanny version of a western gunslinger, haunted in advance by the future he’s working to bring about. The entire structure of Oppenheimer is built around the detonation of that first bomb, the pivot point where theory becomes practice and the nature of reality shifts. The nearer we get to ground zero, the more the film moves towards abstraction: the editing speeds up, the repetitions of Ludwig Goransson’s hammering score grow more insistent, and the recurring flashes of cosmic imagery take on a nightmare quality as if the narrative universe were about to collapse in on itself like a black hole. Since this never quite happens, the aftermath can hardly be anything but an anticlimax. If a degree of tension persists, it’s largely through the film’s reluctance or inability to answer its central questions: was Oppenheimer at all justified in agreeing to work on the bomb, and how much responsibility does he personally bear for the outcome? Perhaps Nolan feels a similar uncertainty about his motives for making this often laborious yet genuinely strange and gripping movie – a grand spectacle inspired by some of the grimmest events in human history, and itself an invention meant to blow us all away.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The Pitch: One of the most significant events of the 20th century — arguably one of the most significant events in human history — was America dropping two nuclear bombs on two cities in Japan, which decisively ended World War II. While many men and women helped to create said bombs, it’s Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) who history declared to be “the father of the atomic bomb.” And thus it’s his story which writer/director Christopher Nolan has chosen to tell, with the support of a $100 million budget and what feels like every white male actor working today. Not Really a Biopic: As a viewing experience, Oppenheimer is a whole lot of movie, a man’s life given the epic treatment — because he did do truly epic things, things that elevate his life story beyond the limitations of genre. And thus, the film proves exceptional at drawing the audience into the experience, when it lets the power of its images do the talking. Its best moments stand out as some of the most original and exciting filmmaking of the year, highs that do a lot to counterbalance the sequences which dive back into bureaucracy and comparatively petty rivalries. While the name of the main dude is also the title of the film, and the dude in question is a real person, Oppenheimer works hard to escape the traps of the biographical drama, largely successfully. The opening minutes do include a point that can best be described as “J. Robert Oppenheimer has to think about his entire life before he testifies.” However, when the film digs into the particulars of creating not just the atom bomb, but the entire infrastructure required to create said bomb, it’s packed with gripping details. And when the countdown begins for the one true explosion we see on screen, it’s a simply masterful piece of filmmaking, drawing the audience into a real-time appreciation of what exactly it meant for those men and women to witness this level of history. Thanks to cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, it’s like watching the birth of a sun on planet Earth, an awe-inspiring sight, and the second it seems like it’s over, it’s followed by what sounds like the roar of creation, the beginning of the universe — except, of course, it’s creation’s opposite. Hundreds of filmmakers have depicted explosions before. Hell, before the movies had even figured out how sound worked, people were blowing stuff up on camera. What Nolan achieves here is on a whole other level, technical brilliance in the moment, but all the more powerful because the build up to that moment is so deliberate, the momentum growing and growing with a pace that becomes haunting… it’s why epics of this length need to be this long, so that the payoff is that much sweeter.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023",Nolan&#8217;s most powerful provocation in &#8220;Oppenheimer&#8221; lies in his suggestion that the American Prometheus came not only to deliver knowledge through science but also to expose destructive forces that already existed within the national character&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","Downey is the crucial supporting player, and he gives a shrewd, dynamic performance as the wily, insecure, powerful Strauss.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," I have no idea if it was Christopher Nolan’s intent to basically make an homage to Oliver Stone’s JFK (a movie I personally love), but it sure seems apparent to me that that’s what he’s done here, even though I’m not sure he’ll admit to it. My best guess is Nolan knows what this is, but doesn’t play fast and loose with facts like JFK does (by all accounts Nolan was meticulous in getting historical facts correct; the same cannot be said about JFK).  (*Downey is pretty terrific here and his part is especially interesting in that I’ve, quite frankly, never seen him act using this acting style before. He’s made three movies since 2008 where he’s not playing Tony Stark (Oppenheimer is the fourth) and his baseline acting style is Tony Stark. He was Tony Stark before he was Tony Stark. Why might have to go back to movies like Back to School, Johnny Be Good, or Weird Science where he wasn’t playing the wisecracking likable rascal. Anyway, it was actually pretty startling to watch Downey act as opposed to kind of just kind of be on cruise control with a persona he’s done a million times.) Here’s where I’ll stop pointing out how much this movie resembles JFK, but just know almost every example I cite for the rest of this piece, I’m sure thinking it. For a literal three-hour movie, Oppenheimer moves pretty well. A big reason is this is a movie that doesn’t stay on one scene very long. A character will be recounting his or her story and we will see brief flashbacks. Sometimes in color, sometimes in black and white (ahem, JFK). A character testifying will set up a scene, then we will flashback for that scene. Which, in a movie that depends heavily on very complicated science, serves as a somewhat effective way to handle exposition about how splitting atoms can be used to create atomic bombs. Though, honestly, it may not be a bad idea to read about what the difference is between uranium and plutonium and why sometimes it’s better to explode an atomic bomb and, other times, implosion works better. Oh, and how stars work and what happens when they die. Oppenheimer does kind of assume you have a halfway working knowledge of atomic energy. At its heart, Oppenheimer is about J. Robert Oppenheimer’s struggle with humanity … on multiple fronts. There’s his relationship with his first wife, Jean (Florence Pugh ), who he feels he fails. Then his relationship with his second wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), who he also fails. (Blunt deserved a lot more to do in this movie. Relegated to pretty much one “powerful” scene where she “tells it like it is,” earning a smile from a crotchety old coot.) Then his relationship with humanity itself, and his role in killing hundreds of thousands of people with his work. After being recruited by Matt Damon’s Colonel (then, later, General) Groves, Oppenheimer finds himself in a makeshift town in New Mexico developing the bombs, and he could tell himself that this was an unfortunate necessity. The Nazis were working on the same technology and had a big head start. If Oppenheimer didn’t develop these weapons, the Nazis would surely win. And he uses this line to recruit some of the best scientists in the Unites States.  But then what happens when Germany surrenders? And Japan, a country that wasn’t surrendering, but also wasn’t developing their own bomb, becomes the intended target? “It will still save lives by ending the war,” politicians, bureaucrats, and military leaders tell him. But this is of little solace. It was a demonstration for the Soviets and Oppenheimer realizes this – becoming his foundation for pushing for atomic treaties and his stance against the much more powerful hydrogen bomb. (Complicating matters, not mentioned in the movie because there’s enough going on, near the end of World War II the Soviets declared war on Japan. So the United States also very much wanted to end the war quickly at that point for geopolitical reasons.) But, as a movie … yeah we get making a bomb that kills a lot of people and probably keeps one up at night. Yeah, I bet. I’m not sure the movie is saying much more than that and, at three hours long, even though the editing and narrative style keeps it moving, it gets to be redundant. When Nolan takes on true stories, it’s interesting. He’s less likely to get in his own way with some of his obsessions. Sure, in Dunkirk, he still uses time as a construct, but I found how he did it there interesting, as opposed to Tenet, which seems to exist to, mostly, please Christopher Nolan. But I do think Nolan has an obsessive eye for getting historical events correct, which makes his work about these historical events even more interesting. So, I do appreciate that aspect. (Though, there’s one eye-rolling moment in this movie where a very famous future U.S. President’s name is mentioned in a, “who is this guy,” kind of way that is nowhere as clever as he thinks it is.) (Speaking of obsessions, I did want to mention the format I saw this in (70mm IMAX) has gotten a lot of attention for being 11 miles of film. You know, I have to admit, I was kind of excited to check this out since it’s only being shown that way in a handful of locations around the world, including here in New York. When it started, I found myself impressed. But then as the movie goes on, as always, I eventually forget. There’s only so long I can keep consciously reminding myself, “This is in film!” before I stop paying attention.) But, in the end, JFK was about Jim Garrison’s quest to uncover the truth, if there actually was a hidden truth or not. (Garrison, and Oliver Stone, certainly believed so.) Oppenheimer shares that DNA (and style and structure) with Nolan’s fixation on the truth about J. Robert Oppenheimer. As Emily Blunt’s Kitty Oppenheimer tells her husband, “Will anyone, ever, tell the truth about this?” Christopher Nolan has obviously accepted this question as his charge. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023","Nolan taps the full sensory potential of moviemaking, pushing picture and sound to meet the scale of the story: clever lines dot the script; the whole project is admirably willing to wrestle with matters of great weight through cinema. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan loves to make movies about the vast forces and abstract concepts that shape our understanding of the world: time, gravity, perception. Even when he turns his gaze inward on the human mind, in films like the psychologically scrambled Memento or the dream-state thriller Inception, his explorations of the metaphysical realm have strict, architectural designs that tend to trap and dwarf the characters within them — like figures on one of Inception’s Escher staircases.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch. He’s often accused of coldness, I think unfairly. This is a director who takes pains to find a relatable, emotional, sometimes even sentimental way into all that awestruck bigness. But those emotional hooks often feel more like the on-ramp for his stories than the destination. In Interstellar, Matthew McConaughey journeys to the center of a black hole to find that the secret of the universe is love — but is it really, or is it the implacable gravity, capable of bending time itself, that sucks him in? In Nolanworld, we humans can attempt to find meaning in the forces of the universe, or to bend them to our will, but they ultimately rule us. The bigness wins. Until Oppenheimer. The paradox of this film — a three-hour historical epic about the theoretical physicist who unleashed the terrible forces of the quantum realm and became the “father of the atomic bomb” — is that it’s a lot less interested in science and mechanics than most of Nolan’s previous movies, and a lot more interested in people. It’s still vast in scope and meticulous in design. But this is the film in which Nolan ponders the scary proposition that the most powerful force in the universe might be us. The film has a different texture and tempo than Nolan’s previous work, likely because he’s working from an extremely rich source text: American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s acclaimed biography of the scientist who led America’s development of atomic weapons during World War II. There’s an enormous amount of material for Nolan to unpack: pivotal scientific concepts, political and military machinations, huge moral questions, and the not-so-small matter of one man’s complex life. As a screenwriter, Nolan rises to this intimidating task, and the work of adaptation inspires some of his best writing to date. Broadly, Oppenheimer’s running time is divided into three clear acts. The first is a whirlwind biography of the mercurial physicist, as played by Cillian Murphy. The second is a gripping science procedural following the construction and first test of the A-bomb at the Manhattan Project’s remote facility in New Mexico. And the third, woven throughout the first two, is a political and legal thriller about an attempt to dismantle Oppenheimer’s reputation and legacy in the postwar years. It wouldn’t be like Nolan to tell this story straight; he establishes multiple time frames from the start. Ostensibly, there are two tracks: a full-color chronology of Oppenheimer’s life, and a black-and-white framing device featuring Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), a nuclear-power broker whose relationship with Oppenheimer comes under scrutiny as Strauss seeks a U.S. cabinet post in Washington in the 1950s. Even this isn’t enough intricacy for Nolan, who regularly blurs the lines, flitting between multiple narrative layers, film stocks, and screen ratios as he tries to organize the torrent of information. It’s a testament to his structural fluency that all of this isn’t more confusing — and to his storytelling that it all works in service of the story, rather than drawing attention to its own tricksy ingenuity, as his scripts sometimes do. More remarkable is the extent to which the characters and the mess of their lives force their way to the surface through Nolan’s grand design. Nolan has a habit of overexplaining everything — if Dunkirk is still his best movie, it’s because it’s the only one where he lets his awesome imagery do the talking. Oppenheimer is a very talky movie, with more than its fair share of scenes where people hold forth while pointing at equations on blackboards. But there’s simply too much complexity here to rely on imagery or sit with any particular moment for long, which forces Nolan to keep moving. Between the cracks, a very human strain of warmth, anxiety, and even wit finds its way out. (If you like a good physicist joke or two, you’re in for a treat.) Credit to the cast for finding and emphasizing that humanity — particularly Murphy, who is hypnotic in the extremely challenging role of a charismatic, aloof egotist whose hunger for mastery carries him to a moral breaking point he dare not express. His gaunt, sculptural face fills the frame for much of the movie, those translucent, icy eyes staring through reality and out the other side. Oppenheimer sees everything, but also fails to see what’s right in front of him. Among the vast, starry cast, Downey is a revelation in a subtle, elusive, but pivotal character part. Matt Damon, peppery of hair and sensible of mustache, helps ground the movie as Maj. Gen. Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s pragmatic military boss. Benny Safdie adds a striking note of sweaty unease as Edward Teller, a younger physicist on the project who went on to father the even more destructive hydrogen bomb. Gary Oldman has a startling, chilling cameo as President Harry Truman. And Tom Conti makes for an avuncular Albert Einstein, although Nolan’s script reduces the great thinker to a rather basic, symbolic role: the angel on Oppenheimer’s shoulder, or perhaps a one-man Greek chorus, shaking his head at the folly of man. The women, predictably for Nolan, fare less well. Florence Pugh labors through some awfully embarrassing conceptual sex scenes and an inevitable fridging as Oppenheimer’s lover Jean Tatlock, who was central to the physicist’s arm’s-length involvement with the Communist Party in the prewar years, which would eventually be used against him. And Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, has too much fire and resolve to be playing a Great Man’s miserable, alcoholic wife — though Nolan at least has the good grace to hand her a late peach of a scene featuring some of the best dialogue he’s ever written, which she rips through with relish. For all his intellectualism, Nolan is also a broad-brush populist, and as ever, the clash of these instincts leads to some gauche, goofy moments, like the early scenes of Oppenheimer studiously reading T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land and pondering a Picasso. Sometimes Nolan seems insecure working outside of his usual thriller mode. Ludwig Göransson’s insistent, nervy score is overused throughout, harrying the dizzying montage of Oppenheimer’s life into an almost comical blur when it would be better to let the drama breathe. But once the film reaches the secret Los Alamos Laboratory, where the bomb was developed and tested, Nolan and his team are in their element. Hoyte van Hoytema’s majestic photography drinks in the pitiless desert as the stage is set for the bomb test: a wartime triumph and a terrible human tragedy. There may never have been a more consequential explosion, and while Nolan perhaps assembles the set-piece and films the blast with a touch too much excitement, he makes up for that in what follows, emphasizing the disorienting, dehumanizing haste with which the atomic bombs were subsequently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan wisely averts the camera’s gaze from that atrocity, staging it instead as a horrifying, metaphorical hallucination, in which Oppenheimer’s inner world turns to ash. In its final stretch, Oppenheimer uses the political campaign to discredit the physicist and unpick his legacy as a way to get under the skin of a man whose stance on his awful creation remained contradictory and enigmatic. After the overpowering bomb sequences, that’s a surprisingly subtle and complex tack for Nolan to take, but it works because the story is driven by the historical record and the characters, rather than by dogma, with the appalling moral consequences emerging naturally from the details. Nolan is not one to let any member of the audience miss his point, and the film’s final scene does ram it home. But first, he builds out the web of ambition, compromise, dreams, politics, jealousy, and inspiration — in a word, humanity — that unleashed the forces he stands in awe of. In Oppenheimer, man is the most dreadful machine of all. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is one of a handful of directors who can reasonably lay claim to the title of ""greatest of his generation."" Oppenheimer will do nothing to damage that claim, and plenty to advance it. Let’s start with the cast – you’re doubtless already aware of the talent-heavy top-billed ensemble who have been doing the rounds promoting the film. Cillian Murphy as the titular J Robert Oppenheimer, the key scientist behind the first atomic bomb; Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty; Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr as the military men overseeing the project; and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s mistress Jean Tatlock. Beyond this, though, every “minor” role seems to find another A-lister cropping up on screen. Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Hartnett, Olivia Thirlby and Tom Conti are just some of the big names taking on roles that, under another director, would likely be cast from unknowns grateful of a half-day on set. Gary Oldman pops up for what he modestly described to Deadline as ""one scene, a page and a half"" as President Harry Truman, but which feels like an Oscar-winning turn in the hands of such a talented director. Nolan is a man of such attention to detail that even his own eldest daughter, Flora, makes a brief appearance in a harrowing apocalyptic scene. Nolan’s explanation? “The point is that if you create the ultimate destructive power, it will also destroy those who are near and dear to you."" There are plenty of other flags that we’re dealing with “serious” fare here, rather than the bubble gum offerings of the global box office’s other big release this weekend, Barbie (out in the UAE on August 31). The frequent use of black and white for the scenes of the US establishment’s attempts to discredit the physicist due to his post-war pacifism and left-leaning politics are a solid reminder that this is “art,” as is the film’s three-hour runtime. That hefty length is perhaps as useful a viewpoint from which to judge Oppenheimer’s merit as any. Even as someone who literally watches films for a living, any requirement to spend upwards of around the 130-minute mark in a cinema seat sparks an internal debate as to whether it actually requires any longer than two hours to unfold. Oppenheimer passes the two-hour test with flying colours, and the chunky 180 minutes went by in a flash, pardon the questionable atomic pun. Part courtroom procedural, part history lesson in the development of humanity's most terrifying creation, part primer in the basics of theoretical physics, part romantic drama following the philandering of a flawed scientific genius with a touch of the Don Juan, and even home to some almighty explosions that would put your typical summer blockbuster to shame – there’s an awful lot to unpack here, and Nolan does so expertly. It’s testament to the filmmaker’s skill that, whether he’s telling the story of a fictional, caped billionaire keeping crime off the streets of Gotham or one of the 20th century’s most significant, yet least celebrated, scientists, Nolan is able to get right under the skin of his subjects and make the audience feel like we’ve known the characters all our lives. This applies not only to Murphy’s Oppenheimer, but Blunt’s put-upon wife, Pugh’s libertine mistress, Damon’s grudgingly admiring military master and Downey Jr’s scheming naval officer turned would-be politician too. By the end of the film we know every one of these characters, their hopes, dreams and motivations, as if they were our best friend – or worst enemy, in certain cases. Ever since Nolan’s 2000 breakout Memento, it’s become almost compulsory for the conversation to turn to Oscars each time the director releases a new film. Thus far in his career, although his films have racked up plenty of wins, Nolan himself has been restricted to five unsuccessful writer/director nominations.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer is a devastating portrait of man's hubris in the face of change, with some of the most startling & horrifying images of Nolan's career.   Editor's Note: This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being covered here wouldn't exist.   Christopher Nolan's films often feel like puzzles he has solved, and, as he shows us how the pieces come together, we experience a process of discovery with him. In his latest, the puzzle isn't so much the film itself, but the man at its center, the Father of the Atomic Bomb J. Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of a lifetime in Oppenheimer, fearlessly diving into the torn psyche of a man who realizes what he has unleashed upon the world, but can't help but feel fascinated by his creation. It is an intricately woven character study, approaching Oppenheimer's life from three distinct angles at a breathless pace that doesn't stop until Nolan reveals the devastation left in the man's wake and the future he still fears.   Based on the book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Nolan wrote the script for Oppenheimer in the first person, taking his preoccupation with the subjective point of view to new creative heights. Oppenheimer is so firmly within its title character's head that the film is jarring at first as it shifts between color (Oppenheimer's perspective) and black and white (the world as seen through the lens of Robert Downey Jr.'s Lewis Strauss, who served as the chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission). Downey Jr. may very well steal the show as Strauss, as he manages to upstage just about everyone in Oppenheimer's stacked cast. Over the various timelines, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Casey Affleck, Benny Safdie, Alden Ehrenreich, and more appear in small but substantial roles that serve to flesh out the world Nolan depicts. As they converge, the director crafts a devastating portrait of man's hubris in the face of great change, bringing forth some of the most startling and horrifying images of his career.   Oppenheimer operates much like the man at the center of it. It is brash, moving at a pace that pays no mind to whether you're keeping up. The actual Oppenheimer was known to be charismatic, and Murphy taps into this, but, as if his performance is moving backward and forward through time, the weariness of Oppenheimer in the final hour lingers over the actor like a specter throughout the film's nearly three-hour run. Oppenheimer knows what's coming and, like the atom, is split in two, a man pushing forward at the excitement of innovation, of creation, and a man who discovers a level of power that will change the course of history and could ultimately destroy it. That Oppenheimer knows this early on doesn't deter him. The apocalypse haunts him, but it doesn't quite scare him. He stares directly into its bright ending, the hint of a smile between his lips as they are parted in awe.   Oppenheimer's fragmented structure gives way to some of Nolan's most distinctively discomfiting imagery in years, including one scene between Murphy, Pugh, and Blunt that speaks to the depth in which we are in Oppenheimer's fractured psyche. These feelings of discomfort give way to abject horror, moments that are compounded by Nolan's symphony of chaos — sparks colliding, atoms splitting, feet stomping, stars imploding, desert dust sweeping against the landscape. It's a crescendo of all his stylistic flourishes and, in one fell swoop, Nolan brings about devastation and heart-pounding excitement. He is daring us to look at the images he's created and not be as horrified as we should be. There will certainly be horror — one sequence, in particular, is the most harrowing of Nolan's career — but horror soon gives way to despair and the director brings it home in a final hour that is as devastating as it is illuminating.   Blunt, who stars as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty, gives a career-best turn as Nolan brings various threads to a head. Like her husband, Kitty is both fascinated and terrified by what man can create. Her husband, who has looked the apocalypse in the face, is a shell of a man fighting to save a world that is doing everything it can to exorcise him. He distracts himself with women — Pugh makes every second of her time onscreen count and another tryst has grave consequences that ripple through the film's final act — but it's Kitty who is by his side in the end and Blunt is quietly revelatory in the role. The real ending of Oppenheimer, though, comes when Nolan allows himself to look forward and bring some of the incendiary imagery we've only seen in flashes to its devastating finale.   The process of discovery in Oppenheimer goes down many paths. Nolan may have the science down pat — experts have praised his take on everything from interstellar travel to the moral dilemma of the scientist at the center of this film — but it's man that may remain an even greater mystery for the director. ""Fission,"" a title card revealed at the onset of Oppenheimer, is the process in which a neutron slams into an atom, causing it to split in two. Fission is exactly what happens to Nolan's subject: Oppenheimer's fascination with discovery collides with the horrifying realization of what raw power can do to a man and the world around him.   Nolan has been criticized for what some consider sterile filmmaking, asserting that he is more focused on the technical components of his movies than the human ones. Oppenheimer marries both — through intimate close-ups, Murphy communicates personal devastation with a dawning realization that he has created a new world. Nolan films heated technical conversations and devastating domestic squabbles like thrilling action scenes, imbuing each word, each facial tic with a sense of impending doom. Both strikingly personal and monumental in scale, Oppenheimer may be Nolan's greatest achievement. Creation does not come without consequences and Nolan wants to remind us that we are still feeling the repercussions of one man's designs decades after they've been unleashed upon the world.

"Jul 19, 2023"," “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s staggering film about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the man known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” condenses a titanic shift in consciousness into three haunted hours. A drama about genius, hubris and error, both individual and collective, it brilliantly charts the turbulent life of the American theoretical physicist who helped research and develop the two atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II — cataclysms that helped usher in our human-dominated age. The movie is based on “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” the authoritative 2005 biography by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Written and directed by Nolan, the film borrows liberally from the book as it surveys Oppenheimer’s life, including his role in the Manhattan Engineer District, better known as the Manhattan Project. He served as director of a clandestine weapons lab built in a near-desolate stretch of Los Alamos, in New Mexico, where he and many other of the era’s most dazzling scientific minds puzzled through how to harness nuclear reactions for the weapons that killed tens of thousands instantly, ending the war in the Pacific. The atomic bomb and what it wrought define Oppenheimer’s legacy and also shape this film. Nolan goes deep and long on the building of the bomb, a fascinating and appalling process, but he doesn’t restage the attacks; there are no documentary images of the dead or panoramas of cities in ashes, decisions that read as his ethical absolutes. The horror of the bombings, the magnitude of the suffering they caused and the arms race that followed suffuse the film. “Oppenheimer” is a great achievement in formal and conceptual terms, and fully absorbing, but Nolan’s filmmaking is, crucially, in service to the history that it relates. The story tracks Oppenheimer — played with feverish intensity by Cillian Murphy — across decades, starting in the 1920s with him as a young adult and continuing until his hair grays. The film touches on personal and professional milestones, including his work on the bomb, the controversies that dogged him, the anti-Communist attacks that nearly ruined him, as well as the friendships and romances that helped sustain yet also troubled him. He has an affair with a political firebrand named Jean Tatlock (a vibrant Florence Pugh), and later weds a seductive boozer, Kitty Harrison (Emily Blunt, in a slow-building turn), who accompanies him to Los Alamos, where she gives birth to their second child.

"Jul 19, 2023"," “Oppenheimer,” Christopher Nolan’s masterful portrait of the man known as the father of the atomic bomb, has been anticipated with some skepticism among filmgoers who wonder how Nolan’s penchant for Imax cameras and thundering sound designs would serve a story that, at its core, amounts to scenes of different groups of men arguing in different kinds of rooms (chalkboard with indecipherable physics equations optional). It turns out that Nolan’s monumentalist aesthetic is perfectly suited for a story that otherwise could barely fit within a feature-length narrative: It’s too big, too consequential, its layers of hubris and history and swirling social impulses too unruly to be neatly contained. If “Oppenheimer” is a supersize movie, that’s because anything else would do a disservice to J. Robert Oppenheimer, the tragic figure at its core brought to fascinatingly paradoxical life by Cillian Murphy. It’s easy to see why Nolan was attracted to Oppenheimer as a protagonist. Not only was he a man of seductively gnarly complications, but he moved through the 20th century as an avatar of its most deeply held aspirations and anxieties. And he’s not always sympathetic: We meet him as a promising student in theoretical physics who gets back at a condescending tutor at Cambridge by poisoning an apple on his desk. “Oppenheimer” begins in medias res — in the middle of things, the “things” being the title character’s whirlwind academic career, which took him from England to Germany and Amsterdam, then finally to Caltech and Berkeley. As Oppenheimer makes a name for himself in quantum mechanics — he’s written a widely circulated paper on molecules — we also meet the man who will become his chief antagonist: Lewis Strauss, the businessman and philanthropist who recruited Oppenheimer to head the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and who would ultimately bring Oppenheimer low after their work together on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. There’s a lot of information to keep track of in “Oppenheimer.” Spanning four decades, during which the title character goes from protégé to prophet to pariah, the movie is a jumble of time frames, narrative arcs, and characters who move in and out of the subject’s life in sometimes shocking but always intriguing ways. Luckily, Nolan — who wrote the script, adapted from Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s book “American Prometheus” — knows his way around a scrambled chronology. With movies like “Inception,” “Interstellar” and “Tenet,” Nolan has enjoyed keeping the audience one step behind, world-building across the space-time continuum in ways that probably only Oppenheimer himself could understand. Here, he tames the impulse to be too opaque, keeping the audience oriented and informed throughout a consistently absorbing narrative that demands close attention but rewards that commitment with a movie that evolves from a historical and biographical deep dive to a meditation on moral injury and, in its final hour, to a thoroughly gripping psycho-political thriller. Who knew that the question of sending radioactive isotopes to Sweden could be so riveting? But it is, thanks to a superbly crafted film in which we watch Oppenheimer not just pursue his career at Berkeley but become besotted by the brilliant psychiatrist and political activist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Like many in his era, Oppenheimer and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold) were sympathetic to the freedom fighters in Spain, and sent their contributions to the cause by way of the American Communist Party. Like so many of their peers, the Oppenheimers would be attacked for leftist sympathies during the McCarthy era. But in “Oppenheimer,” the title character’s attraction to inventing the atomic bomb is portrayed within the context of the greater modernist project: When Picasso, Eliot, Stravinsky and Freud are reinventing the world, shouldn’t scientists be just as revolutionary? Of course, it helps if that enterprise is undertaken during a moment of supreme moral clarity, like beating Hitler to the punch. When Manhattan Project overseer Gen. Leslie Groves (a relaxed, often dryly funny Matt Damon) approaches Oppenheimer to assemble a scientific team to build a bomb that will end the war, “Oppenheimer” enters the let’s-put-on-a-show phase. At Los Alamos, N.M., Oppenheimer becomes “founder, mayor and sheriff” of a community of thousands of researchers and family members who will take three years to build the bombs that would eventually decimate Hiroshima and Nagasaki and launch an era of nuclear escalation and brinkmanship. One of “Oppenheimer’s” most powerful moments is the A-bomb test, code-named Trinity, which Nolan stages with the familiar self-engulfing flames, but in almost complete silence; the only sound is of Oppenheimer’s nervous breath. Then the shattering boom. Later, when Oppenheimer addresses his Los Alamos team on Aug. 6, 1945, Nolan stages a magical-realist breakdown wherein the man who would be lionized for ending the war becomes overtaken by horror and grief. Throughout “Oppenheimer,” the already reed-thin Murphy seems to grow more skeletal, ethereal, a wraith whose chief features are his glasslike blue eyes, ever-present cigarette and catlike purr of a voice. His Oppenheimer is part machinist, part mystic, ever questioning the apocalyptic implications of what he’s discovering. (Albert Einstein, played by Tom Conti, pops up helpfully as an occasional interlocutor.) Toggling backward, forward and sideways in time, Nolan doles out tantalizing hints to what would become of Oppenheimer after the war: How Strauss, cannily played by a virtually unrecognizable Robert Downey Jr. as a cold-eyed Washington knife fighter, executed his bureaucratic defenestration during the Red Scare, fueled by actual instances of espionage at Los Alamos. How Oppenheimer would cope with sudden fame, power and his own personal foibles. And how so many of his famous and to-be-famous colleagues responded to the strain of American anti-intellectualism that today feels all too dispiritingly familiar. Murphy commands “Oppenheimer” as its deceptively still, small center, but he’s surrounded by an impressive cast of supporting players — not just Damon and Downey, but Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, Kenneth Branagh as Niels Bohr and Gary Oldman as Harry S. Truman. In a film with precious few female roles, Pugh brings bruised life to the commitment-phobic Tatlock, and Emily Blunt mounts an artfully calibrated sneak attack as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, who spends much of the film sour and disappointed, only to morph into the film’s most ferocious Cold Warrior, her armor a carapace of pearls, Cherries in the Snow lipstick and righteous rage. There is so much substance to “Oppenheimer”: so many ideas and contradictions and philosophical quandaries; so many egos, talents and temperaments, loyalties and lofty ideals. Murphy’s mesmerizing performance notwithstanding, those ineffable forces are what drive “Oppenheimer,” which Nolan films mostly in finely etched close-ups, punctuated with shots of stars and water and cosmic blasts. Visually, the movie is nothing short of magnificent, both the color footage of the Los Alamos years and the black-and-white sequences featuring Strauss, which glisten as if they were filmed by James Wong Howe. Nolan’s weakness for underscoring detracts from a few scenes that would have been better served simply by letting viewers hear the actors at work, without intrusion. (The film’s urgently propulsive music is by Ludwig Goransson.) But the dialogue in “Oppenheimer” is scrupulously comprehensible — a victory for anyone who has found Nolan’s sound mixes to be unintelligible in the past. One of the conundrums of “Oppenheimer” is whether its enigmatic title character was a Great Man or the victim of his own inflated self-importance. With that in mind, it feels hyperbolic to call the film a masterpiece. But, without a chalkboard and hyper-credentialed brain trust handy, that word will have to do. As a filmmaker at the height of his powers, Nolan has used those prodigious skills, not simply to amaze or spectacularize, but to plunge the audience into a chapter of history that might feel ancient, as he reminds us, but happened just yesterday. By making that story so beautiful, so elegantly crafted and compulsively watchable, he has brought to life not just J. Robert Oppenheimer, but the still-crucial arguments he both started and tried to end. “Oppenheimer” boldly posits that those arguments are still worth having, in a film of magnitude, profundity and dazzling artistry. A previous version of this article incorrectly referred to the Institute for Advanced Study as being at Princeton. Although located in Princeton, N.J., the institute is not affiliated with Princeton University. The story had been corrected.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," An enigma stands at the centre of Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s engrossing drama that is as much about American physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer as it is the terrifying new world he birthed. Running three hours and anchored by a riveting, prickly performance from Cillian Murphy, the film weaves together elements of the courtroom procedural, the Cold War thriller and the character study, leaving the mysteries of ‘the father of the atomic bomb’ fascinatingly unsolved. Nolan demonstrates his usual prowess for impeccable visuals and stunning craftsmanship within a deeply despairing portrait of an arrogant genius who, too late, realised the impact of his monstrous creation. Universal unveils Oppenheimer on July 21 in the UK and US, and strong reviews may help a picture that is, thematically at least, far from a commercial sure-thing. Nolan’s track record will be an enticement — as will a supporting cast that includes stars and Oscar-winners — although this adult-skewing period picture (based on the 2005 biography American Prometheus) lacks the blockbuster action of Inception or Dunkirk. Yet, with Barbie also opening on the same day, the online hype surrounding “Barbenheimer” should juice theatrical grosses, with awards nominations seemingly a certainty down the road. Murphy stars as the infamous physicist as the film focuses on two crucial periods: one, during the 1940s, when Oppenheimer leads the Manhattan Project, which produces the first atomic weapon; and later, during the 1950s, when he deals with the emotional and political fallout of his history-making discovery. Working with editor Jennifer Lame, Nolan moves back and forth chronologically, dramatising these time periods as well as a tense 1950s hearing regarding the renewal of Oppenheimer’s US security clearance, and a Cabinet confirmation for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.); a member of the Atomic Energy Commission whose connection to Oppenheimer will become an important plot point. Screened for critics in 70mm IMAX, Oppenheimer is wondrous to behold, Hoyte van Hoytema’s cinematography providing the film with a large-canvas grandeur that amplifies the stakes of Oppenheimer’s quest to develop atomic weapons. A brilliant Jewish scientist whose ego is matched only by his anger at the Nazi murder of his people during the Second World War, Oppenheimer believes that the US must create these weapons before the Germans do — although his intellectual curiosity about communism makes some, including the blustery Lt General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who recruits him to run the Manhattan Project, suspicious.  Murphy effortlessly conveys Oppenheimer’s serene superiority — his unflappable confidence that he is the smartest man in any room he enters — but, at the same time, there’s a chilly unknowability to him that intrigues. Watching Oppenheimer, viewers may be tempted to draw connections between the titular protagonist and Nolan, who is often accused of constructing icily intelligent pictures that are emotionally lacking. Whether or not that criticism of Nolan is fair, Oppenheimer exudes a subtle poignancy in its depiction of a man tragically seduced by his own purported greatness. Tellingly, once Oppenheimer attracts America’s best scientists to assist him in the Manhattan Project, travelling out to the vast, empty deserts of New Mexico to conduct their dangerous nuclear tests, Oppenheimer de-emphasises the sequence’s inherent excitement, instead presenting the proceedings with a grim sense of impending doom. There’s no thrill to Oppenheimer’s discoveries — even the much-anticipated scene of the detonation of the first atomic bomb is more ominous than electrifying — as Nolan observes this stoic genius’s gradual recognition that he has made the world a more dangerous place, no matter his rationalisations to the contrary. Murphy’s withholding, haughty performance echoes Daniel Day-Lewis’ more demonstratively bullheaded turn in There Will Be Blood, another deeply critical portrait of so-called American exceptionalism. Unfortunately, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh are stranded in underwritten roles as, respectively, Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty and his former lover Jean. Meant to challenge his elevated view of himself, these female characters barely have enough screen time to register — which is especially irksome since both women end up having significant emotional beats that underwhelm.  Far more compelling is Damon as Oppenheimer’s foil during the Manhattan Project, his combative brashness nicely clashing with the physicist’s unruffled cool. And Downey Jr. relishes his turn as a savvy political animal with a different sort of intelligence than Oppenheimer — one that proves superior when navigating the corridors of power.  Nolan has no illusions about his main character, painting him as a difficult, not especially warm figure. But there is room for empathy as well. Scapegoated by enterprising politicians during the Red Scare that swept America in the aftermath of the Second World War, this loyal patriot was branded a communist sympathiser and learnt just how little his nation thought of him once he tried to warn against the dangers of nuclear proliferation. But the film’s complicated feelings about the man are never simplified or resolved — creating a wary tension that feels terribly similar to the lingering dread that our planet’s fragile atomic standoff could give way to total destruction at any moment.

"Jul 19, 2023","Oppenheimer is a movie with power, texture and grace. By the end, we begin to understand its subject, even if we remain baffled by a genius who somehow divorced himself from the damage his theoretical project would do.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan has created a film about creation. Oppenheimer tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Manhattan Project in World War II, who would eventually become known as the father of the atomic bomb. This biographical thriller stars Cillian Murphy as the titular character in one of the most profound, terrifying real-life stories about the man who gave humanity the power to destroy themselves. This is an edge-of-your-seat cinematic experience like no other, with Nolan tapping into something uniquely brilliant. This is Nolan’s second movie surrounding World War II, with the first being Dunkirk in 2017. Although these movies take place in the same period of history, they could not be any more different. Dunkirk was a war movie that followed a thrilling evacuation, but this movie takes things away from the battlefield. This is a movie about the scientists who brought the war to an end in a horrifying fashion. Oppenheimer is a 3-hour epic that follows our lead from his beginnings as a talented, somewhat troubled scientist who wants to make a difference in the world. He’s the person who learned Dutch in six weeks to give a lecture on it and also poisoned an apple given to a tutor he had a complex relationship with. In every way, Oppenheimer is a standout in Nolan’s career. If you think about the movies he’s made over the past few years, like The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, and Tenet, you’ll see he makes high-concept action movies with gorgeous spectacle. Dunkirk was a war movie with practical explosions and planes. Nolan is not using that toolbox with this movie. He tells his most grounded story since The Prestige. He’s not creating a typical blockbuster; this is a dialogue-driven, history-heavy movie about how Oppenheimer became death, destroyer of worlds. Without too many dazzling visuals or action sequences to wow the audience, Nolan is left with the most performance-driven film of his career. He needs a talented cast to do it, and he has assembled one of the best ensembles of the year. Cillian Murphy has appeared in many of Nolan’s movies but never as a leading man. He gets to take the reigns in what may be a career-best performance from him. The way Murphy conveys so much with a facial expression and the way Nolan chooses to linger on him for just the right moment to get a sense of what’s going through his head is superb. Through his eyes, we see hesitation, regret, guilt, and a deep knowledge of his craft. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal in this movie. This performance is a “Stark” contrast from his previous roles, as he portrays Lewis Strauss, an antagonistic figure in Oppenheimer’s story. He speaks differently from how you’re used to hearing him, and he proves that he is not just the witty, charismatic hero we’ve seen many times. Matt Damon and Jason Clarke should also be singled out for their magnificent work in this movie. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh are excellent in their fleeting screen time, but they are the only female characters in the movie, and they don’t have nearly enough nuance to them on the page. It’s telling how Nolan’s scariest movie is a real-life event. This film has you so wrapped up in the situation that you forget you’re watching actors. It’s his most thematically mature movie in a while, with this being his first R-rated movie in over 20 years. The exquisite sound design allows you to feel the looming danger. However, this is also Nolan’s most dialogue-heavy movie, which can feel tedious at times. The strongest elements of this movie are the moments where he goes more psychological, adding a horror aspect with the immersive soundscape and a ticking clock that isn’t always clear but works effectively for the story. There’s a scene in this movie that serves as a remarkable achievement for the characters while also being mortifying under the surface. It is quickly followed by a scene that looks and feels like the fist-pumping happy ending of a movie. The juxtaposition between these scenes is clever, especially because in a story of one of humanity’s darkest chapters, there can be no truly happy endings. It’s a shame that, like most of Nolan’s work, this movie is more heavily based in story than character because a few more character moments could have made this movie drastically better. Regardless of the rough edges, Oppenheimer is a tour de force from Nolan. A cinematic achievement where he takes a dramatic real-life story and makes it into a movie that must be experienced on the big screen. I saw this movie in 70mm IMAX, and I would encourage anyone who can do the same. Hoyte van Hoytema’s gorgeous cinematography, matched with Ludwig Göransson’s breathtaking, Oscar-worthy musical score, cannot be missed. This is a movie about a man dealing with the consequences of his actions and his raw guilt over the culmination of his life’s work. It is a story about creation, and with that creation, the inevitable destruction. As ComingSoon’s review policy explains, a score of 8 equates to “Great.” While there are a few minor issues, this score means that the art succeeds at its goal and leaves a memorable impact. Jonathan Sim is a film critic and filmmaker born and raised in New York City. He has met/interviewed some of the leading figures in Hollywood, including Christopher Nolan, Zendaya, Liam Neeson, and Denis Villeneueve. He also works as a screenwriter, director, and producer on independent short films.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," ★★★★☆There’s a famous Hollywood screenwriting rule called “save the cat!” that describes how, to establish audience empathy, the main protagonist must be depicted, early in the film, performing an altruistic act such as, well, saving a cat. The first significant act that Cillian Murphy’s J Robert Oppenheimer performs in this commanding biopic from Christopher Nolan is attempted murder. Based on a true-life incident from Oppenheimer’s Cambridge student days, we witness how, after clashing badly with the experimental physics tutor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), our mercurial protagonist coolly injects Blackett’s apple with cyanide.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is a filmmaker with a mind for engineering. He’s obsessed with time, constructing stories that move simultaneously at different speeds like the hour, minute, and second hands of a wristwatch. While his films often deal with heavy themes and complex protagonists, it’s usually more interesting to talk about the shape of Nolan’s stories than about their content. The Dark Knight and Inception are thrilling and technically innovative, but they’re not quite as smart as they appear to be on the surface. His latest feature, which stars longtime collaborator Cillian Murphy as the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project, employs all of his usual technical and structural tricks in the service of a story that is truly as complex as it is complicated. Simultaneously a biography, a mystery, a polemic, and a dense character study, Oppenheimer feels like the film Christopher Nolan has been preparing to make his entire career, and it may very well be his best work. OPPENHEIMER ★★★★ (4/4 stars)
Directed by: Christopher Nolan 
Written by: Christopher Nolan 
Starring: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh
Running time: 180 mins. Like The Prestige, Dunkirk, and Memento, the story of Oppenheimer is conveyed via multiple intersecting temporalities. Nolan is kind enough to label the film’s two narrative spines for us: “Fission,” a recollection of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s life and career based on his testimony to a security clearance council in 1954, and “Fusion,” a counterpoint from the perspective of Admiral Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) during his confirmation hearings to become Secretary of Commerce in 1959. Despite not always moving in a linear fashion, the interwoven accounts remain both logically and emotionally coherent, painting a portrait of a controversial figure that is both sympathetic and damning. The two framing devices are not the only courtroom dramas at hand here. The film itself is a trial, and just like the interrogations of Oppenheimer and Strauss, there is no real burden of proof. Nolan is playing both the prosecution and the defense. The trial isn’t fair, he knows it, and he wants you to know. At its heart, Oppenheimer is about the terrifying transformation of theory into practice. The story introduces us to Robert as a young and ambitious scholar in the very new field of quantum physics, but like Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) before him, he is a theorist, not an engineer. How his research is applied is not his concern, or so he asserts until the consequences of his work become impossible for any sane man to ignore. This theme seeps into other parts of his story, such as the juxtaposition of his communist sympathies against his practical political agnosticism, or the reverberations of his irresponsible romantic affairs. How many degrees must exist between cause and effect, between ideation and execution, to assuage him of his guilt? Aside from being heady and profound, Oppenheimer is also much more fun than you might expect. Nolan keeps this massive monster moving at a steady, bracing pace. Though the relentless momentum and wall-to-wall musical score can have a flattening effect, granting practically every scene equal gravity, it also never allows your attention to waver. At no point in Oppenheimer’s three-hour runtime does it feel safe to run to the bathroom. Urgent plot developments and character context unfold constantly, giving this epic biopic the grip of a murder mystery or a political thriller. And for a historical biopic about one of the most terrible events in recorded history, Oppenheimer is surprisingly funny. The playful, Sorkinesque banter between Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer and Matt Damon’s prickly General Leslie Groves is every bit as charming as the timeline-spanning bromance of John David Washington and Robert Pattinson in Tenet. Emily Blunt slays as Robert’s iron-willed wife Kitty, a character whose minimal role in the film’s first two hours is merely the windup for an Oscar-worthy uppercut. Nolan has assembled a huge cast of character actors consisting of about half of Hollywood’s white dudes, but it’s a particular showcase for performers with creepy eyes and punchable faces. Oppenheimer offers a murder’s row of actors you would cast as serial killers — Dane DeHaan, David Dastmalchian, Casey Affleck, Rami Malik, Benny Safdie — and utilizes each of them perfectly. This helps to raise star Cillian Murphy, who filled the serial-killer space in Nolan’s Batman Begins, to the relative position of Handsome Leading Man. Murphy is haunting and nuanced as Oppenheimer, but of all of the film’s sharp performances, Robert Downey Jr.‘s Lewis Strauss stands head and shoulders above. Downey plays Strauss as Oppenheimer’s Burr or Salieri, an insecure political operator whose obsession with the “father of the atom bomb” contains both sincere reverence and seething resentment. After a decade sealed in that Iron Man suit, Downey finally reasserts himself as a generation-defining talent, the reason we ever gave a shit about Tony Stark in the first place. One might imagine that the atom bomb itself might emerge as the lead of Oppenheimer, particularly as the film’s press tour has emphasized the use of practical, optical effects in its portrayal rather than CGI. Nolan and company’s depictions of nuclear reactions both microscopic and gargantuan are, indeed, awe-inspiring, and even as a critic who finds the trend of filmmakers boasting how little VFX they’ve used to be a snobbish affectation, there’s no denying the value of this creative decision. However, more striking than the images themselves is the fact that they help to underscore the film’s humanity rather than distract from it. In Oppenheimer’s first act, shots of sparks and particles are intercut with Robert’s studies, a visual representation of his brilliance. Its first two hours are all building to the Trinity bomb test, which we witness in all its terrifying power. From this point on, however, we no longer see the destructive power of the atom bomb, because Robert himself refuses to look at it. Instead, we feel it, as if his unwillingness to view the reaction he started in the outside world has caused it to begin inside his body, and ours. There’s an argument to be made that any film about J. Robert Oppenheimer is inherently apologia for America’s bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, or at least for the man who made it possible. The absence of a Japanese perspective in the story or any images of the bombings or their aftermath may, too, become the subject of debate in the coming weeks. However, the impossibility of a fair or objective reading is baked into the text of Oppenheimer. The film can either be read as Christopher Nolan defending Robert Oppenheimer, or as Nolan condemning himself for doing so. Is an attempt to understand a guilty person, in itself, an act of forgiveness? Where does the theory end and the practice begin? We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Jul 19, 2023"," You know a Christopher Nolan protagonist when you see him. Sleuth or showman, conquerer of space or invader of dreams, he is a man caught in a trap of his own intricate construction, lost in the maelstrom of a guilty obsession. He may not wear that obsession on his skin like Leonard Shelby, the amnesia-stricken avenger in “Memento,” or parade his demons in as symbolic a fashion as Bruce Wayne does in the “Dark Knight” trilogy. But whether he skulks about in film-noir shadows or blasts forth into dimensions unknown, every Nolan antihero risks becoming the architect of his own obliteration, a cruel fate that may well consume others in its wake. None of which is to suggest that J. Robert Oppenheimer, the pioneering theoretical physicist who became known as “the father of the atomic bomb,” was ever an obvious choice of subject for this filmmaker. Much as Nolan may enjoy contemplating the end of the world, it’s telling that his past flirtations with the apocalypse — the uninhabitable Earth of “Interstellar,” the nuclear climax of “The Dark Knight Rises” — have been consigned to the relatively safe terrain (for now) of blockbuster fiction. With the exception of “Dunkirk,” his bravura thriller about a pivotal early chapter of World War II, Nolan has largely steered clear of historical events and famous figures. He practices a cinema of heady ideas, mind-churning metaphysics and rug-pulling narrative gamesmanship — not an intuitive fit with the more traditional conventions of the Hollywood biopic. 8:30 a.m. July 21, 2023An earlier version of this review stated that J. Robert Oppenheimer led the Manhattan Project. He was the director of the laboratory at Los Alamos, where the first atomic bombs were designed and built. Leslie R. Groves led the Manhattan Project. One of the many satisfactions of “Oppenheimer,” Nolan’s intellectually thrilling and morally despairing new film, is that it succeeds in locating some of those conventions within another of his ingeniously constructed narrative labyrinths. At first glance, Oppenheimer’s story would appear to follow an obvious rise-and-fall trajectory — an arc embedded in the very title of its source material, “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography. A straightforward adaptation might begin with the man’s meteoric ascent into the top ranks of American physicists, build to his involvement with the four-year, $2-billion Manhattan Project and climax with the horrific conflagrations of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It would end, perhaps, with the bitter, disillusioning coda of Oppenheimer’s postwar career, during which he would speak out against nuclear proliferation but never express public regret for the bomb’s Japanese casualties. But Nolan, once again bending narrative and chronology to his will, is after something more elusive than a simple three-act trajectory. He is also less interested in reenacting scenes of mass death and devastation, none of which are depicted here, than in sifting through the bomb’s lingering geopolitical and psychic residue. For much of its three-hour running time, this swift and supercharged movie keeps its designs largely hidden beneath a series of formal eruptions. It leaps between time frames and perspectives, color and black-and-white, crowded classrooms and wide-open desert vistas, and even between aspect ratios, if you’re fortunate enough to see it in Imax. (Hoyte van Hoytema, Nolan’s longtime cinematographer, shot “Oppenheimer” on large-format 65-millimeter film and Imax 65-millimeter film; it’s the first picture to make use of black-and-white Imax stock.) The point of these convulsions is hardly to confuse or overwhelm the viewer, as Nolan is often accused of doing, but rather to suggest something of its subject’s sweeping intellectual grandeur and complicated, often contradictory essence. Oppenheimer, played over four decades by a superbly restrained yet intensely expressive Cillian Murphy, is a polymath and a polyglot, a lover of art and literature as well as science. He is visionary and short-sighted, arrogant and convivial, an academic and an outdoorsman, a family man and a womanizer, a defender of the working class and a man of undisguised privilege. Trying to unpack a tricky quantum mechanics concept for a Berkeley student, he notes, “It’s a paradox, but it works,” an assessment that might just as well describe himself and this movie. He is less a character to be dramatized, in short, than a series of equations to be continually rebalanced, if never fully solved. To that end, Nolan filters Oppenheimer’s mostly linear personal narrative through two framing devices, both set well after World War II. One is a private 1954 Atomic Energy Commission hearing where a somber Oppenheimer faces a tough interrogator (Jason Clarke) and the imminent revocation of his government security clearance. The other, shot in black-and-white and set in 1959, follows the former AEC Chairman Lewis Strauss (an outstanding Robert Downey Jr.), who’s waiting to be confirmed as President Eisenhower’s secretary of Commerce — a contentious process that becomes overshadowed by Strauss’ own past associations with Oppenheimer at Princeton. All this narrative fragmentation, plus the jumble of names, titles and government acronyms, can be overwhelming at first, but Nolan and his editor, Jennifer Lame (“Hereditary”), intercut their threads with extraordinary propulsiveness and lucidity. Those who go in knowing the outcomes of the AEC proceedings and Strauss’ Cabinet bid will see past the red herrings that Nolan occasionally strews across the path of history. But even they may be held rapt by the coolly understated animus that binds Oppenheimer and Strauss — a tension to which Nolan keeps returning, and which Downey unpacks in a performance of beautifully coiled serpentine layers. Crucial to the characters’ adversarial dynamic is an enchantingly mysterious early interaction with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), a moment that establishes Oppenheimer’s easy collegiality with his fellow great minds. Soon we’re back in the exciting if tumultuous early days of his career, which take him across a great swath of 1920s Europe, where he hobnobs with field pioneers such as Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and befriends a fellow Jewish American physicist, Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz), who foreshadows the rising tide of antisemitism worldwide. In one alarming episode from his time as a lost, wild-haired student at Cambridge, Oppenheimer reveals a capacity for irrational, intensely personal violence — a darkness that is being either tempered or triggered by his stunning visions of the subatomic world. In these wondrously transporting images of juddering waves and swirling particles, accompanied by the rumbling, surging, keening strains of Ludwig Göransson’s magnificent score, Nolan makes a rare leap into realms of pure cinematic abstraction. In time, Oppenheimer has been ensconced as a professor at both Berkeley and Caltech, a corner of 1930s academia that turns out to be a hothouse of scientific discovery and political intrigue. Neat, fastidious and charming, he turns the heads of more than a few women, especially within the trendy Communist Party circles he frequents, and Murphy’s enigmatic reserve suggests a spirit of sexual and ideological promiscuity. Before Oppenheimer marries a thrice-divorced woman, Kitty (Emily Blunt, fierce), he is drawn to the self-destructive flame of a troubled paramour, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, also fierce), generating flashes of erotic heat never before approached by Nolan’s cinema. Oppenheimer’s romantic indecision echoes his own refusal to put out politically, as he declines to join the Party despite his own avowed left-wing sympathies — a pose of high-minded neutrality that will prove his success and his undoing. He is, to paraphrase one of the script’s heavier-handed thematic contrasts, a theorist rather than a practitioner, hopeless in a lab but commanding in the classrooms where much of the movie’s paper-waving, blackboard-scrawling action unfolds. But it’s precisely Oppenheimer’s ability to envision the bigger picture that makes him singularly qualified for a significant role with the government’s top-secret Manhattan Project, aimed at building a weapon powerful enough to end the war and possibly all wars. And it’s Oppenheimer who will successfully propose moving his family and many others to Los Alamos, N.M., where a top-secret laboratory and soon an entire town is built to accommodate a closely-monitored staff of thousands. Some sly military-industrial complex humor creeps in as Oppenheimer, clad in his signature gray waistcoat and rumpled porkpie hat, leads this massively complicated undertaking at the surly behest of Col. Leslie R. Groves (a gruffly amusing Matt Damon). These two characters’ odd-couple head-buttings (previously dramatized to lesser effect in the 1989 movie “Fat Man and Little Boy”) here set the tone and rhythm for a project that thrives on a spirit of scholarly disagreement and tetchy troubleshooting. “Oppenheimer” is both an unerringly focused character study and, somehow, one of the year’s most sprawling ensemble pieces, with vivid turns from Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirlby, Casey Affleck and Dylan Arnold, among many others. Benny Safdie makes a memorably sweaty and argumentative Edward Teller, an early proponent of the hydrogen bomb who has his own shifty role to play in Oppenheimer’s postwar tribulations. And while this is a primarily male-driven story, which speaks as much to the inequities of history as it does to Nolan’s dramatic predilections, Blunt brings startling force to the role of a woman who shames her faithless husband with a loyalty that surpasses all reason. Through it all, Nolan remains the consummate Hollywood theorist and practitioner, someone who realizes his grandiose conceptual ambitions with a stubbornly hands-on, ground-level command of cinematic craft. He and his production designer, Ruth De Jong (“Nope”), seem energized by their physical re-creation of the Los Alamos site, which we see being constructed from the ground up as barbed-wire fences roll out and military vehicles roll in. There’s palpable urgency and mounting dread to this world-building, and also a striking contrast with Van Hoytema’s interior-dominated visuals, which turn human faces and confined spaces into giant-screen landscapes. There’s also a splash of “There Will Be Blood” in Nolan’s vision of an indelible American darkness taking root in western soil, especially when a 100-foot tower springs from the earth, soon to be engulfed by the fiery cloud of the world’s first plutonium implosion device. That fateful 1945 “Trinity” test, dramatized with a mix of queasy suspense, seat-rattling spectacle and fascinating logistical details, tears a hole in the fabric of the movie — a rupture that it’s both prepared and unprepared to fill. As Oppenheimer is confronted with the gravest consequences of theory becoming practice, a story of human intelligence and enterprise becomes one of monstrous, clockwork-like betrayals, some sweepingly systemic and some intimately personal. Part of the subtle greatness of Murphy’s performance is the way his character seems to empty out in the story’s later passages, as though succumbing to a kind of moral and psychological paralysis. “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” he murmurs after the Trinity explosion, quoting from the Bhagavad Gita. The real Oppenheimer may have never expressed remorse over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but the movie never lets its Oppenheimer forget them, especially in one shuddering, blood-chilling sequence that transforms a public moment of triumph into an indictment. Nor can Oppenheimer forget the still greater destruction that may yet be unleashed, a prospect that his typically naive and high-minded insistence on “international cooperation” will do nothing to dispel. Nolan conveys that warning with somber gravity, if not, finally, the cathartic force that our current headlines, full of war and nuclear portent, would seem to demand. Not for the first time, the demonstrative cleverness of his storytelling can seem too precise, too hermetically sealed and engineered, for a sense of raw collective devastation to fully take hold. That might be a rare failing of this extraordinarily gripping and resonant movie, or it could be a minor mercy. Whatever you feel for Oppenheimer at movie’s end — and I felt a great deal — his tragedy may still be easier to contemplate than our own. Watch L.A.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Skipping across multiple timelines - this is a Christopher Nolan film, after all - much of the meat of the story comes framed by a grey-haired Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) testifying in a shabby little room to a group of men who, it rapidly becomes clear, do not have his best interests at heart. Youthful, frizzy haired Oppenheimer's past studying ""the new physics"" across Europe is skimmed across; when he settles down in Berkley to teach, the clouds of war are already boiling and his dalliances with Communism are raising eyebrows. Meanwhile in a black & white 1959, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) is going before a senate committee hearing to confirm him as a member of Eisenhower's cabinet. Post war, he gave Oppenheimer a job at Princeton; now, it gradually becomes clear, the father of the Atomic Bomb has fallen from public favour. Will their past connection cost Strauss a cushy government job? And what exactly was the nature of their connection anyway? Nolan is good at a lot of things, and juggling plot points to create suspense has been a strong point of his all the way back to Memento. The final hour of this three hour film pulls together a range of well-woven strands to build a solid drama around the fall of an American Prometheus (though Icarus seems almost as appropriate). For a film touted for its stunning visuals and IMAX cinematography, it's surprising how much of this is just men in suits in small rooms; there are other ways for a film to be big, and when it counts this delivers big time. For one, there's a cast stacked with stars (a repeated pattern is a recognisable name getting one big scene, then a muted callback set years later); for another there's plenty of sweeping desert scenery at Los Alamos - at times it feels like Oppenheimer's trademark hat should have been a cowboy one. Despite many of the scientists being refugees from Europe (and wanting to beat Hitler to the Bomb is shown as their primal motivation), Nolan makes sure to frame this as an American saga, stars and stripes flying high.  The core of this story is the Manhattan Project, though the mechanics and technical challenges are largely kept off-screen. Background reading isn't essential but wouldn't hurt, if only to keep track of the hurricane of scientists swirling around Oppenheimer's eye. We get the drift: the Bomb was a big deal, and on the rare occasions when this film wants to hammer home the point about the awful forces being unleashed - they do have to test the Bomb, even if there's more than zero chance it will ignite the atmosphere and destroy the world - rest assumed the hammer hits hard.  More important here is Oppenheimer himself; it's his name on the poster after all. This is a big budget epic with a recognisable human being at its center, which is to say Oppenheimer is often a smug jerk who turns his back on one wife (Florence Pugh), cheats on another (Emily Blunt), informs on his commie friends to a government he knows contains people who will torture or kill them, is wracked with guilt maybe a little too late, and is shocked to learn that the US military isn't his best friend once he's given them the city-destroying Bomb they wanted. The film focuses tight on Oppenheimer, and intentionally so. The Atomic Bomb may have changed the world, but this isn't a film about that world; if he didn't see it, or imagine it, then - Strauss's confirmation aside - neither will we. He's a man who could and did inspire others, a leader of personal charm and charisma (how else could he have kept a rabble of top scientists working in the desert for years on a super weapon?), but here much of that is told, not shown.  When Oppenheimer does speak to a crowd or group, Nolan will often use that moment to show us his thoughts (sex scenes, charred corpses) rather than the effect of his words. Whatever he had in him to inspire such loyalty - beyond the natural attraction of Murphy's always compelling performance - remains a mystery. What we do see clearly is that the world around him is one of overlapping modes of power, whether the systems of the state, the unity of organised labour, or personal commitment to an individual. Each are in violent dispute with the other, and giving your loyalty to one earns you the lifelong enmity of the rest. It is a world of eternal, brutal conflict; no wonder Oppenheimer came to regret giving it the Bomb.",POSITIVE

Oppenheimer – aka ‘How we learnt to start worrying and loathe the bomb’ – is Christopher Nolan’s most ambitious movie yet. Even on an IMAX screen in 70mm, the format you should absolutely see it on, its themes and ideas spill over the sides. The result is stubbornly uncompromising in its IQ, flawed in the spirit of its protagonist, centre-pieced with one of the most jaw-dropping visual sequences since 2001: A Space Odyssey, and entirely gripping – even over three meaty hours. With his twelfth movie, Nolan atomises any expectation of what a blockbuster can or should be. And only he could have made it. Not just because for a chunk of its runtime, it’s a bunch of blokes in lab coats pensively chalking complex formulae on blackboards and generally making Interstellar look like Sesame Street. Or that he’s cast as its protagonist, nuclear physicist and A-bomb pioneer J Robert Oppenheimer, a charismatic but hardly A-list character actor in Cillian Murphy, and that its two biggest movie stars, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon, take striking but unshowy supporting roles. Or even that, in a world of CGI, Nolan opts to recreate the first A-bomb test using practical effects (a don’t-try-it-at-home mix of gasoline, aluminium powder, magnesium and propane). Only Nolan could make this potentially forbidding subject matter so thrilling. Oppenheimer is paced like a chain reaction, each one of his and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema’s immaculately-lit compositions cascading into the next, building to an immensely satisfying crescendo and leaving you shaken to the core.  Murphy’s brooding, titular physicist is charged with running the wartime Manhattan Project, assembling a team of boffins to weaponise new-found discoveries in the realm of nuclear physics, initially against the Nazis, but ultimately and controversially unleashed on Japan. An enjoyably gruff Damon is well utilised as the lieutenant general who oversees the mission in the New Mexico desert and punctuates the gravitas. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are both terrific as the women who coax out Oppenheimer’s humanity in Nolan’s most romantic film to date (albeit, still not massively romantic). The stakes are bigger here and more believable than anything Nolan has done before, a point he drives home with a few hardly nerve-soothing shots of the planet being immolated, eerie sound design and Ludwig Göransson’s grand, Hans Zimmer-like score. It’s not perfect. Tom Conte makes for a jovial but unconvincing Albert Einstein (Michael Emil does a better job in Nicolas Roeg’s Insignificance, a fascinating companion piece for Oppenheimer) and Kenneth Branagh’s Danish accent zips around like a free neutron as Oppenheimer’s physicist mentor, Niels Bohr. One sudden injection of nudity is wildly incongrous rather than intentionally jolting. Occasionally, the dialogue feels designed to catch the audience up (look out for Alden Ehrenreich as ‘Senate Aide Who Explains Things’).  In fairness, there’s a lot that needs explaining. Oppenheimer charts a time when the world was spinning on its axis like that corridor in Inception, and Nolan’s script – based on the 2005 Pulitzer-winning biography ‘American Prometheus’ – leans into that complexity to satisfying effect. He uses black-and-white photography to fast forward to Oppenheimer’s post-war struggles with McCarthyite factions and Downey Jr’s bitter politician, then darts back to his colourful, confidence-building formative years in Cambridge and Germany, before decamping to the arid desert of New Mexico for the bomb-building itself and whispers of a Soviet agent in the camp.It’s a Rubik’s Cube of genres – thriller, courtroom drama, war film, romance, people-on-a-mission flick – that’s held together by the magnetic Murphy, wearing the burden of his world-changing creation on his increasingly lined face, as well as the unwavering confidence of Nolan’s filmmaking.  The cumulative effect is so stunning and antithetical to anything Hollywood is doing at the moment – the equally audacious Barbie aside – that it feels like a completely different art form. And, frankly, hallelujah for that.  By entering your email address you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and consent to receive emails from Time Out about news, events, offers and partner promotions.

"Jul 19, 2023"," The atom bombs dropped on Japan in 1945 reportedly killed up to 226,000 people. The war they ended killed up to 85 million. The weight of humanity was put on the scales 78 years ago and one man decided which way they tipped – a scientist whose work in theoretical physics held the power to end wars, to start them, and to change the whole course of history. Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer-winning book, American Prometheus, is known as the definitive biography of J. Robert Oppenheimer – and it’s easy to see why director Christopher Nolan picked it up in the first place. Obsessively researched, dense with detail and immaculately structured, it’s the perfect subject for Nolan – and for what might be his best film so far. Here he makes his biggest and smallest movie in one – something eclipsing the scale of Inception and the intimacy of The Prestige – a dense three-hour drama set in cramped rooms filled with men talking about particle physics and political depositions that feels more thrilling and explosive than any summer blockbuster. If you’re not too hot on your nuclear fission, don’t worry. Complex theories are explained with fishbowls and marbles and dazzling visual effects, but Oppenheimer isn’t about science, it’s about a man. Painting a delicate character portrait on the largest canvas imaginable, Nolan casts Cillian Murphy as the flawed, brilliant doctor at the centre of his history – and then pushes pretty nearly everything else out of the way. Oppenheimer’s most famous words (“I am become death, the destroyer of worlds”, taken directly from Hindu scripture) are repeated twice in the film, years apart. First in a flash of arrogance, then in horror, everything that happens in between is Oppenheimer’s own fall from grace, finding a haunting moral worminess for Murphy, and only Murphy, to live in. For a film so long and so crammed with great performances, the laser focus of the script is astonishing. Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Robert Downey Jr are all exceptional (as is Florence Pugh, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh and pretty much every other A-lister in Hollywood), but they’re all playing parts that Nolan deliberately places as far in the background as he can. “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important!” Damon’s General Groves (Oppenheimer’s boss) barks at the rail-thin protagonist, something his long-suffering wife (Blunt) could easily have yelled the other way around. Cocky, obsessive and often unlikeable, Oppenheimer is a complicated man, but Murphy brings him brilliantly to life; cold and contradictory in a film that roars with fire. Literally. It might not have the flashiest action set-pieces of the summer, but some of the scenes in Oppenheimer are dazzling enough to be genuinely frightening. See it in IMAX, if you can, to really experience it – not just the wall-shaking violence of the explosions but also Nolan’s giant 70mm camera pushed right up into the film’s heart and soul in even the smallest of talky boardroom scenes. Not just the definitive account of the man behind the atom bomb, Oppenheimer is a monumental achievement in grown-up filmmaking. For years, Nolan has been perfecting the art of the serious blockbuster – crafting smart, finely-tuned multiplex epics that demand attention; that can’t be watched anywhere other than in a cinema, uninterrupted, without distractions. But this, somehow, feels bigger.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," 
	Taking its cues from the exhaustive, Pulitzer-winning book American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, Oppenheimer seeks to cram as much of the man’s life, his work, his elevation to national hero, his eventual persecution, and his personal demons into three hours. Just for good measure, Nolan throws in not one but two competing courtroom dramas as well. There’s a roll-the-dice sensation throughout: Scenes of people sitting in rooms talking can seem thrilling or plodding, clarify historical conflicts and complicated concepts or confuse the hell out of you. Set pieces feel sweeping one second, and like they’re sucking the oxygen out of the room the next. Then, suddenly, the movie cuts to a huge close-up of Murphy, his eyes suggesting a man wrestling for his soul, and you’re transfixed. As with so much of Nolan’s work, you can feel a truly great film peeking out in fits and spurts within a longer, slightly uneven one. 
	So let us now praise movies about famous men, and the famous men who make them. Oppenheimer is most assuredly a Christopher Nolan film, complete with the blessings and the curses of what that phrase entails. The good stuff first: There are a handful of sequences that remind you why this 52-year-old director is considered a godhead by film geeks, genre freaks, and armchair arthouse-cinema scholars alike. When Nolan is on, he is on, as evidenced by the early scenes of Oppenheimer and his military liaison, General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, all mustache and bluster), assembling the eggheads. Their plan is to turn the small New Mexico burg of Los Alamos into a self-sufficient, family-friendly town for a group of scientists and a top-secret think tank for a weapon of mass destruction. The military need the end result of the Manhattan Project to win WWII, preferably before the Germans develop their own version of “the gadget.” Oppenheimer, both compelled by and wary of the opportunity, wants them to maintain the “moral advantage” after the world sees what this thing can do.  
	Concentrating on the mounting pressure to deliver, the miniature steps forward with each behind-the-scenes breakthrough, and the accountability factor causing friction between the project leader and his patrons, Oppenheimer becomes its own ticking time bomb. All the while, fractures are happening within the team, and the precariousness of the situation, along with Oppenheimer’s willingness to go through with opening this Pandora’s Box, brings things to a tipping point. These scenes remind you of how Nolan understands the use of sound and vision as a means of emotional engagement (helped in no small part by his regular cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema and composer Ludwig Göransson‘s score); how his ability to fold complex ideas into presentations of human behavior, and vice versa, comes through in his writing; how the timing of a cut and the framing of an image can transform a moment from grandiose or mundane to sublime. The gent is a genuine filmmaker. He’s a big-screen artist, the bigger the screens the better.  
	There’s Florence Pugh, and Emily Blunt, and Benny Safdie, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Jason Clarke, Matthew Modine, Olivia Thirlby, Dane DeHaan, Alden Ehrenreich… it’s actually quicker to list who’s not in Oppenheimer. Nolan has said he wanted to cast recognizable faces so that audiences could keep track of who’s who easier, but he also gives them opportunities to flex, whether it’s for a minute or the majority of the running time. And given that there are so many scenes of people conversing, reading, lecturing, interrogating, handwringing and musing over the morality of mass destruction, they have to keep things afloat as much as their ringmaster. 
	As those two trials intertwine and paint a picture of Oppenheimer as both McCarthy-era martyr and, ultimately, the victor over Strauss’s smear campaign during the movie’s last act, there’s a slight sensation of listening to wind blowing through torn sails. In attempting to get a 360-degree picture of his subject’s life and times on as big a scale as possible, it feels as if Nolan occasionally loses sight of the big picture as a whole. Oppenheimer is one of those shoot-for-the-moon projects that feels thrilling and wonky, brilliant and overstuffed, too much and yet not enough. It’s also a movie that brings to mind the difficult era-spanning epics of yesteryear, from Reds to The Right Stuff, and is a movie made by adults for adults yet done with the sweep and majesty we now associate with movies made for kids and teens. Nolan has made what can sometimes feel like a maddeningly elusive attempt to make a grand statement about then and now, only to continually drown himself out in the technical equivalent of the Zimmer Honk. He’s also given us one of the only movies of the summer that you really have to see. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Often, Christopher Nolan’s films feel like something much more complicated than they are. On paper, they’re not nearly as in-your-head as people make them out to be. He gives us all the information we need to know, the exact message that he’s trying to bring to life in his work, and with Oppenheimer, Nolan has shown us what power does to men and what happens when they are, for once, faced with the consequences of the abuse of it.  Split between black and white and color, shot on film as Nolan is wont to do, and visually stunning, Oppenheimer will feel like a long haul while you’re in the thick of its 3-hour runtime, but when it decides to punch you in the gut, you’re left breathless with the weight of the world on your shoulders, just as J. Robert Oppenheimer was at a pivotal time in history. The complicated figure of Oppenheimer is played by Cillian Murphy in a stunning display of complexity and simplicity that leaves you seeing his tale of woe and regret come to life while still understanding the mass destruction he brought upon the world. A cast of brilliant actors all gunning for the truth and excitement of science and winning a war, Oppenheimer serves as both a history lesson and a cautionary tale about what happens when one’s own ambition and drive clouds their judgement and puts the fate of mankind and innocent lives at risk. Men in power will be their own destruction, and they will destroy lives in order to gain what they want. Nolan, however, brings us a gaze into the complicated world that Oppenheimer built for himself and how science and power left him a shell of the physicist he was and a man with blood on his hands. Oppenheimer highlights the reality of the quest for knowledge, science, and the dangers of doing so without anyone there to stop you. In the case of J. Robert Oppenheimer, he was a man who was hindered by his own inabilities. He wasn’t great at lab work, was bad at math, and used his science-forward thinking to become the top theorist in the United States. What Oppenheimer shows us is what happens when men like that are given all the things they couldn’t do before. Oppenheimer was allowed to create a team of the best minds in the country to work on an atomic bomb when the atom was first split (and not by Americans). The project was led by Oppenheimer, with the resistance of the government due to Oppenheimer’s connections to the Communist party, and it led to them having an easy scapegoat when they wanted him gone, simply because eventually Oppenheimer saw what his monster could do and wanted to stop the world from imploding in on itself. As a whole, the themes of Oppenheimer boil down to one simple fact: Men in power will not see the stakes at hand until it’s too late. When you bring up Oppenheimer the man, many damn him, and rightfully so. His creation directly led to the deaths of around 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The race to complete the atomic bomb started as a way of beating Germany to the punch, but in the midst of its creation, Adolf Hitler died and Germany surrendered. That wasn’t enough for the United States government, and the creation of the bomb went on to kill civilians in Japan when the war was seemingly wrapping up anyway (according to some historians).  It was one of the darkest times in the history of the world and showed the destructive face of America’s perpetual power grab. What Oppenheimer highlights is the urgency of getting through to those in power about the consequences of their actions and stopping them from making the same mistakes. For Murphy’s Oppenheimer, his struggle really boils down to his work on the Manhattan Project. A famous womanizer, constantly cheating on his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) even after their own marriage started with an affair, Oppenheimer’s personal problems don’t play much of a role in the movie outside of the United States government using his friends against him. What we see instead is a man who watches his life’s work slowly fade away from him and turn him into a monster responsible for the deaths of hundreds of thousands at the very least, who created something that could very much end life as we know it. Nolan uses Albert Einstein’s relationship with Oppenheimer to juxtapose the joy that science can bring with the pain that Oppenheimer caused with his own exploration. It is often the case with Nolan films that you don’t quite know what is happening until the last act puts everything into perspective. With Oppenheimer, it’s the crystal clear focus on the folly of men and their conniving ways when they’re backed into a corner. It really just puts the entire narrative into focus and zeroes in on what Nolan is trying to drive home to his audience. Describing the reaction to his creation’s devastation, Oppenheimer himself famously quoted from the Bhagavad-Gita, “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” and Nolan’s masterpiece does not shy away from the horrors that Oppenheimer’s work at Los Alamos caused the world, especially Hiroshima and Nagasaki. At its heart, Oppenheimer is about consequences and who suffers from one man’s actions. Visually stunning, as all of Christopher Nolan’s work is, Oppenheimer is one movie that really stays with you. You will leave the theater with the flashing red lights of the bombs going off and the pain of all those lost souls, just as Oppenheimer wore on his own mind and conscience, but knowing that we have the chance to take Nolan’s warning to heart. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The next time one of those government committees is being waylaid by some grandstanding blowhard senator or representative essentially arguing against science for political motives — you’ll remember COVID-19, perhaps — whoever is chairing the meeting should halt the proceedings for three hours and make everyone watch “Oppenheimer.” Now that’s the kind of civics lesson I can get behind. Sen. Rand Paul can sit right up front. And it might actually do the country some good. Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is nothing if not a cautionary tale, a stunning film about brilliance and betrayal, arrogance and willful ignorance. It’s powerful, a technically dazzling achievement; so audacious is Nolan’s filmmaking that if it didn’t serve the story you’d think at times he was just showing off. The movie is essentially a biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist often called the father of the atomic bomb. Nolan adapted “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin. If that sounds dry and scholarly, well, have you ever seen a Christopher Nolan movie? “Inception?” “The Dark Knight,” maybe? It’s anything but boring; by the end it’s practically a horror movie and a thriller combined. After all, for a time, Oppenheimer, Albert Einstein and others wondered if exploding the bomb might actually ignite the atmosphere and destroy the Earth. Cillian Murphy, somehow still underrated despite “28 Days Later” and “Peaky Blinders” and several other Nolan films, plays Oppenheimer. He does not lack self-confidence. Nor does he lack the ability to earn it. “You’re not just self-important,” one character tells him. “You’re actually important.” Murphy’s line reading is perfect. He makes Oppenheimer seem not so much boastful as just aware of his gifts and what they let him get away with. This is an amazing performance. Nolan’s signature jumps through time require Murphy to portray Oppenheimer at different stages of his life. Each is convincing. Oppenheimer gets tapped to lead the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, to develop a nuclear bomb. (Matt Damon is funny as the blunt Gen. Leslie Groves, who hires him.) He surrounds himself with his own small army of physicists. The excitement of the theoretical becoming actual is intoxicating — so much so that it’s easy to lose sight of the consequences. Nolan juxtaposes the Los Alamos work with a confirmation hearing in which Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., never better and it’s not even close), seeks a Cabinet position. Nolan shoots this in black and white (a new type of IMAX film was created for the scenes). Strauss should be a shoo-in, except for one thing: his early association with Oppenheimer, who has fallen out of favor with the government. Why? Because while he supported the creation of the atomic bomb for use in Japan, Oppenheimer feared an arms race and where it would lead, and opposed the creation of a hydrogen bomb. During the Joseph McCarthy era, simply expressing a dissenting opinion based on science was tantamount to treason. Other scenes show a rigged committee laughably questioning Oppenheimer in order to deny him his security clearance renewal. Laughable if it weren’t so absurd. The truth is unimportant here, only the preordained outcome. Again, the contemporary echoes are chilling. It’s all chilling. When Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) speaks to the renewal committee, you want to stand and cheer. Finally, someone is willing to tell the truth. Not that it matters. Throw in bits and pieces of Oppenheimer’s tempestuous personal life, including his relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his marriage to Kitty, and the three-hour running time starts to seem not just reasonable, but necessary. The acting is uniformly brilliant, with Murphy, Downey and Blunt simply astounding. Downey is getting a lot of buzz for his performance, and deservedly so. Tony Stark, this ain’t. His portrayal of the slow evolution of Strauss’ character is subtle and devastating. But Murphy shoulders the biggest burden among the cast, and does so beautifully. His Oppenheimer is arrogant, of course. But Murphy’s portrayal is complex. When the bomb testing commences, he quietly intones the words from the Bhagavad-Gita he has studied (he read it in the original Sanskrit, because of course): “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Based on Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning American Prometheus, Christopher Nolan’s biopic of J Robert Oppenheimer is a remarkable feat of engineering and propulsion. Over a relentless three hours, Oppenheimer impregnates committee meetings and disciplinary hearings with the grammar of high-octane cinema. Temporal jumps, Jennifer Lame’s dynamic edits and Hoyte van Hoytema’s ceaseless cinematography approximate a perpetual-motion machine. When the camera isn’t tracking and trailing purposefully striding characters, it pans, zooms and racks. Particles, waves and chain reactions routinely dance across the screen. Ludwig Goransson’s swooping score is jollied along by insistent triads and bombastic brass. Even the foreshadowing is loud: “If only I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico,” the title character wonders, a few scenes before he and his team descend upon Los Alamos to develop and design an atomic bomb. Cillian Murphy’s charming, enigmatic Oppenheimer is whisked through various timelines and monochrome interludes: meeting Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) at Oxford, his early communist activism at Berkeley, arrogant showdowns with his prospective recruiters Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey jnr) and General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) and the humiliating 1954 hearing that saw the architect of the Manhattan Project lose his security clearance. Nolan’s screenplay lightly questions its subject as it lionises. The script can’t entirely account for the slippery character’s metamorphosis from the father of the atomic bomb to the peace mongering “crybaby” who is run out of Truman’s office. The most unpleasant incidents from Oppenheimer’s life – his violence towards college classmates; his disdain for the graduate students he taught – are excised entirely. Tellingly, we never see the post-atomic images that Oppenheimer flinches while watching. Other disparaging details are extenuated or glossed over. Oppenheimer’s intellectual fidgeting – which arguably haunted him on his deathbed more than anything else – is never explored. Nor what Einstein called his autoritdtsdusel, or stupor in the face of authority. Womanising is mentioned, yet one of Oppenheimer’s extramarital conquests is reduced to a glib punchline. Downey jnr’s Strauss questions Oppenheimer’s post-Hiroshima hand-wringing but Nolan is far too enthralled with Oppenheimer and Murphy’s commanding portrayal to follow suit. Awed onlookers frequently sound as if they are pitching for a book blurb: “You see beyond the world we live in,” goes one remark. “The great salesman of science,” goes another. The film’s representation of science is bafflingly facile, even if the chalkboard squiggles on quantum dynamics and quantum physics in the background are undoubtedly (knowing Nolan’s fastidiousness) accurate. “Light is both a particle and a wave!” Oppenheimer cheerily (and anachronistically) imparts to a student. It’s equally unfortunate that the women characters are doughily undercooked. It is a blessed relief when Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt) gets a big scene in the closing third, not least, we imagine, for Blunt, who plays Drunk Refrigerator Mom for two hours of the film. Florence Pugh’s Jean Tatlock is distilled from a real-world intellectual and political influence to Crazy Naked Chick, a glistening pair of breasts that weigh on Oppenheimer’s mind. One particular explicit scene between the pair – you’ll know which one – uses a device that proves a toe-curling R-rated embarrassment. Nolan, an otherwise virtuoso film-maker, has little aptitude for on-screen bunga bunga and the results are bungle bungle. Oh well. The filmmaker’s technique generally counterpoints any caveats and script imperfections. The ensemble cast is starry and strong. The segue from the end of the second World War into the cold war is marked by a spectacular explosion sequence. “Brilliance makes up for a lot,” Murphy’s Oppenheimer tells us. It sure does.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s three-hour historical biopic “Oppenheimer” is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade — an old-fashioned yet cutting-edge work that should resonate with film scholars and popcorn-toting mainstream movie lovers for years and decades to come. At the risk of sounding like Nicole Kidman: This is why we still go to the cinema, to settle into our seats and slip into the darkness when the lights go down, to immerse ourselves in visual and aural storytelling at its finest. From the moment the closing credits begin to roll, we’re already looking forward to the next time we see “Oppenheimer.” Adapted by Nolan from the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird, “Oppenheimer” is a sprawling story that hops along the timeline and introduces so many characters I’ll admit I wouldn’t have minded some title cards introducing them as they come and go. Nolan, however, opts to plunge us into events in sometimes chaotic fashion and invites us to hold on for the ride, mirroring the thrilling and yet terrifying and politically charged atmosphere of the world of physics in the early and mid-20th century, when some of the brightest scientific minds in history were making discoveries and advancements that would change the world forever — and possibly end the world as we know it. With frequent Nolan collaborator Cillian Murphy delivering subtly powerful work as Oppenheimer and an astonishingly deep supporting cast led by Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Matt Damon and Florence Pugh (with more than a dozen additional huge talents popping in for a scene or two), “Oppenheimer” is a massively ambitious undertaking, with Nolan (“Inception,” “Dunkirk”) further solidifying his standing as one of the dominant filmmakers of his generation. Writer-director Nolan tells much of the story in the context of the complicated and eventually contentious relationship between Oppenheimer and Lewis Strauss (Downey), the naval officer and politician and self-styled amateur physicist who was in awe of Oppenheimer’s intellect but came to resent him for his hubris and his politics. When Strauss welcomes Oppenheimer at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1947 to offer him the directorship of the Institute, Oppenheimer is a world-famous war hero known as the father of the atomic bomb, and Strauss is practically a fanboy. By the 1950s, everything had changed, as we see in two primary framing devices that Nolan returns to again and again: the 1954 Atomic Energy Personnel Security Board hearings to determine whether Oppenheimer would retain his security clearance, which were held in secret in a claustrophobic conference room; and the 1959 Senate floor hearings on President Eisenhower’s appointment of Strauss to Secretary of Commerce, which became something of a public spectacle, as Strauss found himself at peril of becoming the first Cabinet appointee rejected by the Senate in decades. (Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema deftly toggle back and forth between vibrant color and stunning black-and-white to depict the different eras.) “Oppenheimer” marvels at the titular subject’s incredible mind, with Nolan depicting Oppy’s genius through subtle notes such as the plinking of raindrops in a pond, and ferocious tones, as when we see Oppenheimer pinned awake in his bed at night, terrified by his visions. As Oppenheimer becomes a superstar in the world of physics and rubs shoulders with the likes of Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), he’s borderline reckless in his personal life, whether he’s attending Communist Party USA meetings (his brother was a party member, as were several close friends) or engaging in multiple affairs, most notably his longtime entanglement with the troubled and volatile Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). When Oppenheimer marries Katherine “Kitty” Puening (Emily Blunt), his life becomes even more complicated, with Kitty experiencing post-partum depression and becoming an alcoholic. Just because you’re a genius doesn’t mean you’re immune from coming home to a wailing child and a wife who is sitting in the dark with a bottle. In 1942, Manhattan Project director Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) appoints Oppenheimer to head the secret weapons lab, and they literally build a town in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to house the collection of scientists and support staff and their families. In one of the most impressively staged sequences you’ll ever see, Nolan re-creates the world’s first nuclear explosion at the site known as Trinity in July of 1945. The teeth-rattling power of the explosion, the symphony of orange in the sky, the reactions of a number of key players as they look on in wonder, the expert use of sound (and in some frames, the lack thereof) — it all adds up to a stunning achievement in filmmaking. And in the midst of it all, we see how Oppenheimer is equal parts thrilled and horrified by what has been wrought. “Oppenheimer” is a great war movie without a single scene of war. It is neither a hagiography nor an indictment of Oppenheimer, as it celebrates his genius and his achievements, while never shying away from his vulnerabilities and failings. This is a film deserving of double-digit Oscar nominations, from best picture to best director to a number of technical categories to the performances of Murphy, Blunt, Downey, Damon and Pugh. It is the best movie of the year so far and one of the best films of the 21st century.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," There’s something very moving about watching a film and being able to see dust motes float in the air. Or the reddened, mottled skin on the back of an actor’s neck. Or the abrasive textures of wood and fabric. Or drops of water causing minute ripples once they descend into a pond – a visual motif that receives its fiery analog at the slow burn climax of this grandiose new film from Christopher Nolan. All of this is the 70mm effect, the wide-gauge film format that, due to its dimensions and design, is able to drink up details that other, lesser film stocks do not have the alchemical make-up to capture. Maybe some could argue that it’s the job of cinema to airbrush out these elements and offer a primped and manicured fantasy of reality, lest we be reminded too much of the lives we’re attempting to escape by going to see such entertainment. Oppenheimer, a luxuriant, tactile and often nerve-shredding screen adaptation of Kai Bird and Martin J Sherwin’s lauded non-fiction doorstop, ‘American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer’, sees the showman filmmaker creating a more intimate milieu for this urgently-paced and personnel-heavy historical biography. It is a film about embracing imperfection, about being realistic with regards to who we are and what we do in this life, and the relative values of taking a chance on a maverick. Yet is also a film which accepts that the tectonic plates of history often make their earth-jogging shifts from within cramped offices or out on dusty, depopulated plains. Indeed, at the time of an in-progress writers and actors strike in Hollywood, Oppenheimer operates as a critique by stealth as it lambasts the scowling middle-men, the steely bureaucratic enforcers, the politicians and the back-room operators whose job it is to coax in the talent they need to perform an immediate function, and then make sure they’re quickly dispensed of at the point of delivery. Nolan attempts to be objective in his lush, realist portrait of “the father of the atomic bomb”, yet there’s a clear sense of awe at both his subject’s inquiring mind, his poise and his role as “director” on the Los Alamos “set” that was built to develop a nuclear arsenal before one of America’s many geopolitical rivals can blow them to smithereens. In his development of the atomic bomb, Cillian Murphy’s Oppenheimer deadpans that the possibility of one such device destroying the world through an atmospheric chain reaction is “near zero”, which causes his more military-minded colleagues to perspire a little. But taking these chances – turning theory into practice – is the only way to find out for sure. That said, despite the character and his world, Nolan doesn’t lean too heavily on the actual quantum physics behind this lofty endeavour. Films such as Interstellar and Tenet were hampered by the need to wrap your head around fanciful sci-fi conceits rooted in real physics, but this allows for a more immediate and dramatic experience by keeping the science simple and off-stage somewhat. The film comprises a rushing, heady continuum of scenes which focus on the logistical ins and outs of the Manhattan Project and the eventual “Trinity” bomb tests, as well as drawing intrigue from the precarious (and, eventually, ferocious) anti-left political sentiments of the era. Nolan appears to frame Oppenheimer as someone who only sees politics in practical terms, not an ideologue or a firebrand who feels he needs to conceal his beliefs. Many of the strongest, most tense scenes chart Oppie’s attempt to score security clearance for a range of potentially disreputable but brilliant science colleagues while fighting a war of words against the men whose job it was to filter out and eliminate possible spies (a small role by Casey Affleck offers a delicious early highlight). As a viewing experience, it’s a film which travels at the speed of Oliver Stone’s JFK, one which is also successful at keeping many plates spinning at one time. It’s rare that a film which comprises so many scenes of men talking in rooms should whip by at such a clip, especially as Nolan’s framing, blocking and movement of the camera is rarely what you’d call artistic (though it more than does the job). Of the famously gigantic ensemble cast roped in to tell this story, there’s not a single player who feels like they’ve been given short shrift. I can see some arguing that Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s communist lover, and Emily Blunt’s tipsy wife Kitty are sidelined in favour of the many male protagonists, yet they both contribute small but important scenes. I would argue that Blunt is responsible for the film’s strongest moment, as she stoically takes the stand for her husband at a sham security hearing and brings home the backbone that he’s currently lacking. But the lion share of plaudits need to go to Murphy who is extraordinary in the title role, transmitting both a boyish passion for learning and discovery and a deep if shrouded sense of paranoia and guilt that would come from revealing the contents of a Pandora’s Box for which he has the only key. His gaunt, greying, unglamorous features are emphasised by the cigarettes he smokes which look like giant white batons dangling from his lips. On that front, he has noted that he was physically modelled on David Bowie’s character from Nicholas Roeg’s The Man Who Fell To Earth, which feels apposite as this too is a film about a genius outsider coming to terms with how he has been exploited from the off. Murphy is a reliably great actor, but this is on a different plateau, a muscular and effortlessly charismatic turn in which he commands every frame he appears in. The film falters in its final act, as the focus shifts to the backroom machinations of Robert Downey Jr’s one-time chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss. It’s nice to see Downey outside of a metal onesie, yet his arc feels manipulated as a way to give the film some conventional closure. This is when the witch trials are at full pelt, and Nolan can’t help but present Oppenheimer as the newly-moralistic martyr, even if he himself didn’t appear to want that end. And yet there’s a paradox: if Nolan was more objectively ambivalent about his subject, does that remove some of the impetus to make the film in the first place? Does he see himself as the lone genius who just about slips out the back door with a moral victory? Oppenheimer shares facets with Nolan’s greatest film, 2006’s The Prestige, in that it is about a man who builds a machine that, if placed into the wrong hands, has the ability to destroy lives. It also has a certain messiness to it, avoiding the hokily rigid plot schematics of Dunkirk, Interstellar and Inception. Robert Oppenheimer, too, operates in the same shady moral domain as Bruce Wayne’s Batman, a self-starting mercenary who’s bottomless financial coffers allow him to mete out punishment on those he believes to be wrongdoers. This film is less about offering some neat, cyclical narrative, and more about navigating the twisty moral maze that comes from harnessing the power of the atom to do great damage on the world and its people. And it’s perhaps kudos to Nolan’s writing (and Murphy’s intuitive interpretation of the text) that all this comes out so cleanly. It’s not a faultless film, but it’s one that sits within the higher echelons of the oft-tawdry biopic form, and also reveals hidden depths to the Nolan project and, excitingly, suggests that we should brace ourselves for anything the next time around.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Don’t let the 3-hour run time fool you because this one earns every minute of it. I left the theater once and that was only so I could refill a drink. At no point did this film ever feel slow because it had my attention for every single minute. It’s a film that must be experienced on the biggest screen possible! Nolan draws on Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, for the basis of the script. He certainly does the research here. Overall, it’s a full team effort. Nolan grounds the story in two hearings while flashing back to earlier parts in J. Robert Oppenheimer’s (Cillian Murphy) life. The first is what we now know to be a sham hearing over his security clearance. The second is Lewis Strauss’s (Robert Downey Jr.) Senate nomination hearing for his Commerce Secretary appointment. While the nomination hearings unleashes the truth about the sham hearing, it was too little and too late. Thankfully, Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson would undo some of the damage by awarding him with the Enrico Fermi Award. Oppenheimer and Strauss’s background are quite the compare and contrast. Both come from Jewish backgrounds although Oppenheimer was less religious. It’s possible that this was a factor in their strained relationship. Speaking of Judaism, it’s nice to see so many Jewish actors portraying Jews on screen. Many Jewish scientists, including those who escaped the Nazis, were a part of the Manhattan Project. Some, like Isador Isaac Rabi (David Krumholtz), would only serve as consultants and be in attendance for the Trinity test. When he first met Oppenheimer in the 1920s, Rabi used Yiddish, which Oppenheimer surprisingly didn’t understand. The Jewishness of so many scientists is not underplayed in this film. It’s one of the things that drives them in finishing their job. If not for antisemitism, it’s possible that the Manhattan Project would have never been necessary. After learning that Germany had a team in place to develop the German nuclear weapon project, the plan was to beat the Nazis to the punch. As we all know, Hitler took the cowardly way out in committing suicide in 1945 and there was no need to drop a bomb in Europe. There was still fighting going on between the US and Japan on the Pacific front. The decision would ultimately be President Harry S. Truman’s (Gary Oldman) to make. As such, the US ended up dropping a pair of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war with Japan. Wisely, Nolan never shows us the U.S. atomic bombs dropping on Japan. That’s not to say we don’t get something of an impact with Oppenheimer witnessing visions or having nightmares. The only bombing we see is the Trinity test in New Mexico. Even when they did the Trinity test, the idea of burning the atmosphere remained a possibility. It’s one thing to come up with a theory but it’s another thing to test a theory and see the results. In any event, we’re still dealing with the ramifications today amid a daily fear of someone pressing a button and launching the world into a nuclear world war. Much like Dunkirk took audiences right back to the beach, Nolan does the same thing here with the Los Alamos Laboratory. They build exteriors at Ghost Ranch in New Mexico but it’s the real deal for the interiors, including the Oppenheimer home. Because White Sands Proving Ground is still an active military base, they film the Trinity test in Belen, New Mexico. If Oppenheimer had his way, the laboratory would have been shut down and given back to the Native Americans. People in the government thought differently, including General Leslie “Dick” Groves, Jr. (Matt Damon) and Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss. It speaks to how Oppenheimer’s views evolved on nuclear policy and why some turned against him. In terms of assembling the brilliant minds, Nolan wisely does not put composites into the film. It would have been wrong and serve an injustice in telling the narrative at hand. Once a scientist puts something into the world, there’s no putting it back in the box. This is an all too prescient reminder as the biopic comes amid a debate about AI and regulating it. It’s not lost on me that the film is being released during the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. While it’s not necessarily about the use of AI, one can see how J. Robert Oppenheimer’s evolving views on the atomic bomb can be representative of the same discussion. It’s a discussion that’s not lost on writer-director Christopher Nolan, who brought it up during a recent Q&A screening in New York. “The rise of companies in the last 15 years bandying words like algorithm — not knowing what they mean in any kind of meaningful, mathematical sense — these guys don’t know what an algorithm is. People in my business talking about it, they just don’t want to take responsibility for whatever that algorithm does. Applied to AI, that’s a terrifying possibility. Terrifying. Not least because, AI systems will go into defensive infrastructure ultimately. They’ll be in charge of nuclear weapons. To say that that is a separate entity from the person wielding, programming, putting that AI to use, then we’re doomed. It has to be about accountability. We have to hold people accountable for what they do with the tools that they have.” Danielle Solzman is native of Louisville, KY, and holds a BA in Public Relations from Northern Kentucky University and a MA in Media Communications from Webster University.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Obsession, escalation, consequence… For his 12th feature, Nolan invests his long-standing fascinations with immense real-world weight in the service of a rare thing, a copper-bottomed auteur film from a director still able to greenlight such projects on a vast scale. Part first-person psychological drama, part historical enquiry, part courtroom drama, Oppenheimer is a colossal achievement: an old-school epic executed with blockbuster verve, sparking with ideas-rich, dialogue-driven substance.  Nolan’s flair for integrating story, style, and subtext ensures the bulging cast and multi-stranded plot never break the film’s back. Eliding eras, he favours experiential immersion over a docu-style chronological approach. DoP Hoyte van Hoytema’s uses of colour and glistening black-and-white elegantly juggle viewpoints, with dazzling visuals evoking Oppenheimer’s quantum-fired mindset. Cut tight, the narrative merges grim inevitability with tension, retrospection with ticking-clock intensity. Ludwig Göransson’s lush, ominous score binds the extremes immaculately.  With espionage subtexts and gallows humour also interwoven, the film’s cumulative power is matched by the potency of Nolan’s questioning. Possibly the most viscerally intense experience you’ll have in a cinema this year, the Trinity test in particular arrives fraught with uncertainty. Might the test inadvertently spark the world’s end? Well, it didn’t - yet. Even as Oppenheimer grips in the moment, Nolan ensures the aftershocks of its story reverberate down the years, speaking loudly to today.

"Jul 19, 2023"," On a basic give-‘em-what-they-paid-for level, Christopher Nolan’s extraordinary new film had to have a convincing explosion at its centre – and on that front, be assured it delivers with flesh-quaking aplomb. But what you also realise, within a matter of seconds, is that it would have also been impossible to pull off without Cillian Murphy’s eyes.  In the lead role of J Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the nuclear bomb, Murphy’s faraway gaze not only convinces you that he can actually see the invisible power that crackles between subatomic particles, but also the gravest, most unforgivable consequences of his unleashing it upon the world. In times of quiet contemplation, it’s as if his attention has been caught by a black hole on the far side of the galaxy; at points of anger or tension, his irises could be the crowns of two tiny, cobalt mushroom clouds.  Those eyes might be the neatest way to sum up what Nolan and his cast and crew have achieved here: Oppenheimer is a film that works simultaneously on the most intimate and cosmic scales. It’s at once a speeding roller-coaster and a skin-tingling spiritual portrait; an often classically minded period piece that only Nolan could have made, and only now, after a quarter-century’s run-up. It unfolds simultaneously in two time periods – Fission, in the scramble towards the fateful Trinity test of the weapon of 1945, and Fusion, in its rattled aftermath – with the structure see-sawing between Oppenheimer’s thirst to crack open the known surface of reality and his horror at what he finds beneath it.  Early scenes of him as a student show him devouring the output of Stravinsky, Picasso, TS Eliot: music, art and poetry all split apart, with untold energy freed in the process, by emerging visionaries in those fields. In a Maximum Nolan move, Oppenheimer positions its lead as their logical heir, and his bomb as the ultimate modernist work. Playing Oppenheimer from his early 20s to late 50s, the 47-year-old Murphy gives the performance of his life, imbuing Oppenheimer’s body with an enthralling nervous eroticism and his voice with a noirish musicality that reminds you of Bogart. The film both manages to make subatomic theory coolly sexy – honestly, five stars for that alone – and seed its sex scenes with Nolan’s signature jangly existential unease.  Meanwhile, both in the bedroom and out of it, the director’s dialogue is strikingly elegant and crisp, giving us the measure of characters within single lines.  Washed along on the surges and throbs of Ludwig Göransson’s gorgeously relentless score, the script’s sheer efficiency allows ensemble members like Benny Safdie, as the permanently sweltering physicist Edward Teller, and Tom Conti, as a cuddly yet shrewd Albert Einstein, to deliver juicy supporting turns in just a handful of scenes. But it also equips the major second-tier players with the material for indelible supporting performances: Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s lover Jean Tatlock, and most notably Robert Downey Jr, who is on the form of his career as Lewis Strauss, the hawkish chair of the Atomic Energy Commission who takes growing exception to Oppenheimer’s (belated) crisis of conscience. Downey’s character becomes increasingly important in the film’s third act – a Hitchcockian manhunt disguised as a legal procedural, in which Oppenheimer’s loyalty to the United States is mercilessly scrutinised. But by this point, the two moments most audience members will have been waiting for – the Trinity test explosion, and the famous line from the Bhagavad Gita (“Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds”) have already been hit.  The exact context in which the latter emerges is simply too inspired to spoil. As for the former – which must surely be the most watched explosion in the history of the moving image – Nolan finds a way to re-stage it that makes its splendour and significance feel terrifyingly fresh. “Try not to set the sky on fire,” Matt Damon’s Lieutenant General Leslie Groves darkly jokes before the red switch is pressed – having learned that the blast, once sparked, might not burn out until the Earth’s whole atmosphere has been consumed. Nolan’s film also makes you feel the seismic, no-route-back import of that single button push: it’s like witnessing history itself being split.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s best and most revealing work. It’s a profoundly unnerving story told with a traditionalist’s eye towards craftsmanship and muscular, cinematic imagination. Here, Nolan treats one of the most contested legacies of the 20th century – that of J Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), the “father of the atomic bomb” – as a mathematical puzzle to be solved. In 1943, at the behest of Major General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Oppenheimer became director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, the Manhattan Project’s New Mexico site for attempting to successfully build an atomic bomb. Oppenheimer, at first, was driven by moral imperative: he feared deeply, as a Jewish man, about what would happen if the Nazis were to develop a weapon of such deadly capability (that a non-Jewish actor has taken on a role in which identity plays such a central role is, in this light, somewhat strange). Following Hitler’s defeat, Oppenheimer continued to support the bomb’s deployment in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, convinced that such hellish destruction would not only bring an end to the war in the Pacific, but to all wars. Historians have since disputed the idea that the bombs were in any way necessary for Japan’s surrender (the real turning point, it seems, was the threat of Soviet invasion). And Oppenheimer’s own utopian vision was swiftly dismantled by fellow scientist Edward Teller (Benny Safdie) and the chair of the US Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr), who pushed forward with the creation of the H-bomb, a thousand times deadlier in its scope. Oppenheimer attempted, in vain, to halt the subsequent nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. He was promptly silenced using one of America’s most cherished tools of political oppression – anti-Communist hysteria. He was attacked for his personal associations with the Communist Party, through his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold), wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and ex-lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). It was an act of pure, public humiliation. Nolan observes each of these chapters with sickly wonder, as Jennifer Lame’s editing work and Ludwig Göransson’s clattering score lend Oppenheimer a frightening momentum. The film is constructed in a way that allows its audience to comprehend, on an intellectual level, the profound power and chaos that led its central character to see himself as the “Death, destroyer of worlds” of Hindu scripture. I’m not sure, however, that it burrows deeper than that – into that profound, emotional space that can be both overwhelming and difficult to verbalise. It’s a little too conscious of itself, and the ways cinema crafts its own reality. Throughout, the film teases an unheard conversation between Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), its inevitable reveal delivered in the same tone as the solution to the teleportation trick in Nolan’s own The Prestige. But the prioritisation of cleverness in Oppenheimer isn’t necessarily a criticism of Nolan – more a testament to who he is as an artist. The detonation of the A-bomb, during its first test in the New Mexico desert, is depicted as booming tufts of flame in extreme close-up, coupled with enraptured onlookers. You sense its primal force, the kind of untapped power that led Oppenheimer to view himself as a kind of American Prometheus (also the title of a 2005 biography Nolan drew heavily from). But contrast that, perhaps, with how David Lynch approached the same A-bomb test in his 2017 limited series Twin Peaks: The Return. Lynch drew the camera in, slowly, confronting us with the full-scale of the weapon’s destruction, while sucking us into its very centre, damning us through its inescapability. Nolan’s A-bomb is wondrous until we consider its context; Lynch’s A-bomb is pure nightmare. The film’s non-linear structure (de rigueur for the Tenet and Inception filmmaker), with each timeline beautifully lensed by Hoyte van Hoytema in either colour or black and white, lends a little more focus to Oppenheimer’s post-war betrayal than it does to the blossoming of his guilt. Large swathes of the film play out as political thriller, the fuel in its engine being Downey Jr’s titanic colouring of Strauss, all boorishness and manipulative charm. But Nolan is still committed to understanding the innerworkings of his subject. Here’s a man deep in denial. When confronted with photographs of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he averts his gaze. Its horrors rumble (literally) in his peripheral vision, only clear to him when he imagines such brutality inflicted on the white Americans celebrating his “victory” in Los Alamos. Murphy creates his own devastating fission: brilliance torn apart by arrogance. Scene by scene, the light behind his eyes starts to dim. He even has sex the same way he builds bombs. After his extramarital affair turns sour, his wife Kitty chastises him: “You don’t get to commit a sin and then make us all feel sorry when there are consequences.” In Oppenheimer, a man’s private, internal, and political lives are strung together, each a component of the great equation that defines a man’s soul.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Though Oppenheimer shares visual and thematic touchstones with Christopher Nolan’s other films, its most obvious point of comparison may be Miyazaki Hayao’s The Wind Rises. Both films are about technical wizards for whom science and engineering are effectively akin to artistic practice. And both are ultimately about the ways in which their subjects’ work is inextricably tied to legacies of real-world harm and devastation. Nolan indulges his fondness for nonlinear plot structures in the film, but the story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) particularly benefits from this approach. Dispensing with the plodding routines of the average biopic, the filmmaker eschews a slow, steady march toward Oppenheimer’s development of the atomic bomb as part of the Manhattan Project during World War II, opting instead to orbit the two most prominent touchstones of the scientist’s life: the creation of the bomb itself and the security hearing to which he’s subjected in the 1950s for his subsequent and quite public renunciation of nuclear weaponry. Throughout, Oppenheimer jumps back and forth between color and black-and-white photography, along the way catching glimpses of its protagonist’s early theoretical work and its later practical application. It also sheds light on his youthful dalliances with leftist, even communist, politics and the way those worldviews come back to bite him after the war. Nolan has been operating in an epic mode since Batman Begins, and the elaborate, almost byzantine staging of his blockbusters tend to overwhelm the characters within his frames. That method is superficially reproduced in Oppenheimer, but this is also the first of his large-scale works to also feel as if it’s radiating outward from its main character’s very psyche. Nolan has assembled a staggeringly large cast of name actors here, many of whom appear on screen for just enough time for us to recognize their faces, reflecting how many important figures crossed paths with Oppenheimer throughout his tumultuous career. The man is merely the nucleus around whom so many of these people orbit, and as fellow physicist Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett) tells the snobbish Oppenheimer as the latter is being recruited by the government during WWII, “You’re not just self-important, you’re actually important!” Nonetheless, Nolan never allows the film to dip into the historical tropes of the great-man biopic and suggest that Oppenheimer was larger than life. The man’s hubris is regularly shown to be his worst asset, forcing him into a series of tactical errors when it comes to navigating the fraught political terrain of WWII, during which the United States was briefly allied with the Soviet Union, even as our nation was waging ideological war with communism. Military attachés inadvertently inflate Oppenheimer’s sense of his political invulnerability while giving him free rein over the Manhattan Project, with the man occasionally making bold demands for personnel, security access, and resources. But Nolan always slips in subtle reminders that the Pentagon brass are the ones really holding the leash and whip in this relationship. And when the physicist finds himself embroiled in a witch hunt sneakily orchestrated by a rival, Atomic Energy Commission head Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., in an icy, venomous performance that counts as his best work in more than a decade), Oppenheimer’s lifetime of assumed authority is turned against him with sickening ease by the same government who relied upon him to end the war and intimidate the Russians. Oppenheimer places us firmly and operatically within the twin pressure cookers of the Manhattan Project’s race to end the war and our agonized hero’s personal martyrdom against McCarthyite purges during the postwar Red Scare. Nolan depicts with pinpoint precision the detonation of the test bomb in the New Mexico desert where Oppenheimer and his team conducted their research, but he notably avoids showing the bombs being dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. That’s a moral choice, and it’s one that perfectly sets up the remainder of the film’s depiction of Oppenheimer’s personal terror at what he had unleashed and his subsequent devotion to nonproliferation. By refusing to turn historical carnage into spectacle, Nolan keeps the true focus on the profound philosophical and moral questions imposed by the existence of the bomb and the way it’s shaped international politics ever since. Oppenheimer is also the latest Nolan film to proudly fly the flag for celluloid in an attempt to stop a digital-only future for cinema. In truth, his fetishism in that regard has often seemed a bit perfunctory given that he tends to put all the properties and possibilities of celluloid toward aggressively gray and flatly composed images. But Hoyte van Hoytema’s luminous 70mm photography here brings new levels of beauty to Nolan’s stark aesthetic. Across the film, light casts deep shadows into research labs and bureaucratic backrooms, conveying the vice-like grip of Oppenheimer’s ivory-tower isolation during his research and the political subterfuge at work to exploit the fruits of his labor. At times, Nolan even blows out the frame, anticipating the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings even before the first tests have been launched and, later, reflecting the psychic toll that those bombings had on Oppenheimer. Elsewhere, the sharply rendered tones of earthen brown and incandescent-bulb yellow create an at once warm and suffocating atmosphere. This subtly mirrors Oppenheimer’s loving but mutually destructive romances with Jean (Florence Pugh), a depressive graduate student whom he meets at Berkeley, and eventual wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), a dilettantish leftist like him but whose clear-eyed assessment of her lack of drive leads to alcoholism and melancholia. For better and worse, Nolan has often turned to practical and scientific means to demystify his films’ subjects, be it dreams, magic, or the impossible antics of one particularly traumatized billionaire orphan. His best work (The Prestige, Interstellar) ultimately resists the comedown that can accompany such explication as the material retains some fundamental sense of wonder. Oppenheimer joins the ranks of those films not for preserving the apparent inexplicability of nuclear physics, but by undermining the idea of science’s objectivity. Oppenheimer’s research and development may obey fundamental laws of the universe, but science has been and likely shall remain forever subject to manipulation by humans who usually don’t even understand it. But that, too, is an indication of Oppenheimer’s failures as much as the predations of power brokers. Throughout the scientist’s trial by kangaroo court in the 1950s, his friends and loved ones ask him why he keeps subjecting himself to this abuse instead of admitting defeat. Only in the final moments of Nolan’s film does the man’s reasoning become clear, and it recasts the drama as an act of willful atonement as much as external persecution.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer is not an easy movie. To say its subject matter and theme are inherently downbeat is something of an understatement. It flings you into a very specific, crowded world and refuses to hold your hand, with a notable absence of date- or location-providing subtitles. It is three hours long, densely packed with info-rich dialogue, and mostly plays out, to paraphrase one character, in “shabby little rooms far from the limelight”. Its story unfurls along two oscillating lines – one titled “Fission”, in vivid colour; the other titled “Fusion” in high-contrast black-and-white – and cuts between their beats and revelations like an anxious channel-hopper. It is, of course, a Christopher Nolan movie. However, despite being deeply stamped with Nolan’s hallmarks (anti-chronological, shot with IMAX cameras, avoids CGI, stars Cillian Murphy), Oppenheimer feels like something new from the writer-director. While it has a logline-level similarity to Nolan’s favourite Spielberg film, Raiders Of The Lost Ark (a man in a hat is racing the Nazis for control of an existentially powerful weapon), its release — and impact — feel more like we’ve reached Nolan’s Schindler’s List moment: a step into deadly serious, portentously resonant, adult material. With one fundamental difference: this difficult historical figure is on a very different trajectory to Oskar Schindler. One might even say the exact opposite trajectory. Oppenheimer is based on American Prometheus, Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s wide-spined biography of the theoretical physicist who “fathered” the atomic bomb. But it is not a biopic. No time is spent on J. Robert’s childhood, with his disturbingly troubled early academic life tackled only briefly. Instead, the film moves briskly from his establishment of quantum theory on US curricula to his recruitment as director of the Manhattan Project (by take-no-shit Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, played with avuncular appeal by Matt Damon). Interestingly, Nolan does devote some time to Oppenheimer’s romantic entanglements, allowing Florence Pugh to elegantly dominate her few scenes as communist activist Jean Tatlock, the physicist’s first lover (which also involve a Nolan first: sex scenes with prolonged nudity). Meanwhile, Emily Blunt thankfully busts out of the supportive/suffering wife archetype as the alcoholic but sharp-witted Kitty Oppenheimer, who gives us one of the film’s most rousing scenes in an intense verbal duel with bullish lawyer Roger Robb (Jason Clarke). Given the sheer extent of the dramatis personae, it’s no exaggeration to say that Oppenheimer features Nolan’s most impressive cast yet. Playing admirably against type, Robert Downey Jr. leads the “Fusion” strand as haughty US Atomic Energy Commissioner Lewis Strauss, whose attempt to join Eisenhower’s cabinet as Secretary of Commerce becomes intriguingly more relevant as the film progresses. Then we have a supporting cast like no other: Benny Safdie as Edward Teller (the inspiration for Dr Strangelove), Kenneth Branagh as Oppenheimer’s Danish mentor Niels Bohr, Josh Hartnett as his close colleague Ernest Lawrence — plus the likes of Olivia Thirlby, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Macon Blair, Casey Affleck, David Krumholtz and Alden Ehrenreich popping up in sometimes the smallest of roles. Not to mention Gary Oldman’s acidic cameo as President Truman, who famously dismissed Oppenheimer as “a cry-baby scientist”. At the film’s pulsing nucleus is Murphy as Oppenheimer, and he is compelling throughout. Given the movie’s hefty import, you’d have expected him to infuse every ounce of his talent into this performance, and that is certainly evident from his every moment on screen — often with cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema’s IMAX lens focused squarely and unsparingly on his face, as he conjures the conflicting emotions that rage beneath Oppenheimer’s surface. This is, after all, a uniquely complex man: praised as a hero for ending the war, wracked with guilt over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and perhaps desperate to cleanse his soul through martyrdom. Nolan complements this exquisitely tuned performance by using his subject’s memories and visions as a kind of visual punctuation, from raindrops rippling ominously in puddles like bomb blasts, to a chilling, briefly glimpsed depiction of “atmospheric ignition”: a posited world-ending outcome of the first A-bomb test. The Trinity sequence itself, in which Nolan’s SFX team somehow create a CG-free approximation of a nuclear explosion, is truly shock-and-awesome, featuring what might just be cinema’s most intense countdown scene. But the film is never visually stronger than when it is inside Oppenheimer’s head, especially during its lengthy closing act, when apparitions of his creation’s life-snuffing effects bleed into his waking life with such nightmarish potency, they’ll be hard to shake for days.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," For a visionary director of big-budget, big-studio, big-idea sci-fi/fantasy movies, Christopher Nolan has often seemed, if not exactly at war with himself, somehow prone to both methodically ascending his big, obvious building blocks and attempting to take wilder, more ambitious leaps. In many of his movies, this emerges thematically as a struggle for control: Of crime (in his Batman trilogy), of memory (Memento), of space and time (Interstellar), or even the seemingly uncontrollable realm of dreams (Inception). That last movie’s exacting, heist-picture portrait of dream-surfing caused some to wonder if Nolan was too literal-minded for the neo-Spielbergian job, but that was exactly the tension that wound the film so tight. The real test of Nolan’s mettle is something like the great-man biopic – not because he’s insufficiently reverent (or dad-ish in his WWII-era interests), but because of the temptation to give himself fully to that innate squareness. Is the guy who evoked terrorism, the surveillance state, and Occupy Wall Street in service of Batman-movie plot points really up for a nuanced exploration of the legacy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, father of the atomic bomb? Yes and no. Nolan’s Oppenheimer isn’t so much a great-man biopic as a great-man-but-maybe-not biopic, and at times, the writer-director seems hell-bent on channeling the instinctive, ethereal ambivalence of a Terrence Malick trip. It’s a fascinating spectacle in large part because Nolan isn’t especially Malickian at all (though at least that frame of reference might temporarily ease the overworked, underbaked Kubrick comparisons). Throughout the film, especially as it builds during its first hour, theoretical physicist Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is beset by cutaway visions of stars, waves, and eventually all-consuming fire, fragments of zoomed-in science, blown up to eye-dazzling, seat-rattling IMAX scale. Is he communing with a higher power of science, or is he having horror-movie visions of the hell he could help to create? In the early going, this version of Oppenheimer would likely have answered the question with a bit of reasoned pontificating, self-attributed to his intellectual curiosity. Though Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), the military man who recruits Oppenheimer to organize the Manhattan Project, rattles off a litany of unflattering descriptors (womanizer, theatrical, neurotic), the one that comes through most clearly in the film’s characterization arrives later, and is more of a backhanded compliment: “You’re not just self-important; you’re actually important.” It’s a line that could have been spun by that master of self-importance, Aaron Sorkin. The similarities don’t end there; Nolan may not be in love with screwball banter like Sorkin, but he borrows the favored Sorkin structure of narrative via hearing, with a time-twisty Nolan-y twist. A private early-50s hearing with Oppenheimer about his loyalties to his country prompts flashbacks to his younger years, while a congressional confirmation hearing for prospect secretary of commerce Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), shot in black-and-white, inspires a different set of flashbacks to post-war strife (though the linear path through the Manhattan Project years ultimately and understandably takes up more screen time). All of this proceeds with Nolan’s usual score-heavy propulsion that makes half the movie feel like a montage and three-quarters of it feel like a thriller; the clandestine elements of the Manhattan Project and the talk of Soviet spies give the movie a feeling of buttoned-up espionage. (Oppie, as several colleagues call him, even has a moment where he dons his signature hat and pipe as if suiting up for a costumed-avenger mission.) A showcase piece, of course, is the first atomic bomb test, where bits of nervous comic relief pop up until the blast drops out Nolan’s usually-booming sound mix, leaving only the sound of breathing for a minute or two. It’s an awe-inspiring and discomfiting climax that hurtles Oppenheimer out of his preferred theoretical realm and into a void of reality. After the test, in the movie’s telling, the scientist is almost immediately sidelined, left waiting by the radio like everyone else to find out when and where the bomb might drop – and, once it does, he’s haunted by the unseen destruction he has wrought. After the war, he argues against nuclear proliferation and the development of the hydrogen bomb. Intellectually, he is simply reasoning things out based on his research and experiences. Politically, he’s committing a provocation. Spiritually, it may be far too late. Oppenheimer sometimes gives the impression, not uncommon in Nolan’s work, that it’s more emotionally complex than the text really offers. (His specialty, in fact, is plot convolutions with mostly intuitive emotional reasoning; he said as much in Tenet, his last sci-fi picture.) Yet there is a clenched, impacted sadness to this semi-opaque figure who spearheads the creation of a bomb whose purpose is all too scrutable in the broader historical view. As played by Murphy, Oppenheimer isn’t quite the volatile hot-shot that Damon’s character describes – he’s more aloof, a nerd who knows he can be coaxed into showing off (which may, come to think of it, be a Nolan version of a hot-shot), which is how he first delivers “I am become Death, destroyer of worlds” as a Sanskrit translation while ridden by a half-naked Florence Pugh. Pugh is playing Oppenheimer’s on-and-off paramour Jean Tatlock, the most interesting of maybe two-dozen intriguing characters played by familiar actors – the film has enough names for three or four well-stocked indie movies – who nonetheless can only appear briefly in this intimate-yet-epic, IMAX-with-close-ups undertaking. She’s most notable for raising and then dashing hopes for a hornier, more carnal iteration of Nolan, though perhaps the glimmer Pugh provides through her ill-fated character will spark into more down the road. Emily Blunt is also on hand, wasted in two senses of the word as Kitty, the woman Oppenheimer winds up marrying. She’s due credit for helping to turn the concerned-wife standby into a seething lush who actively resents motherhood, and for nailing one terrific late-movie interrogation scene, but, like Pugh, the performance feels like an audition for Blunt to do more in a future Nolan project. Maybe they can become semi-regulars like Damon, who Nolan has refashioned into a curt asshole, knowing just how brusque this former golden boy can get before he becomes genuinely unlikable.

"Jul 19, 2023"," After Robert Pattinson gifted the acclaimed director with a book of J Robert Oppenheimer’s speeches at the Tenet wrap party, the filmmaker was inspired to make an incredibly ambitious biopic of the complex and paradoxical historical figure. Oppenheimer the man was a theoretical physicist who organised the Manhattan Project during World War II, which created the original weapons of mass destruction that were dropped on Japan to end the conflict. The Father of the Atomic Bomb led the way to thermonuclear weapons that the USA and Soviet Union stockpiled during the Cold War arms race. And although the Berlin Wall fell, Putin’s invasion of Ukraine last year bringing war back to Europe for the first time since Hitler was defeated makes the threat of nuclear annihilation feel more present than it has in decades. Yet Oppenheimer is first and foremost a biopic examining the life of arguably one of the most influential people who has ever lived, what made him tick and the conflicting forces of his brain’s own electrons and neurons contemplating whether his unprecedented scientific achievements were ultimately for good or evil. The best thing about Oppenheimer is without a doubt Cillian Murphy, whose 1940s fedora hat I will eat if he doesn’t win the Best Actor Oscar next year. The Peaky Blinders star was gifted half a year to engulf everything he could about Oppenheimer the man and give the performance of a lifetime. The 47-year-old totally embodies the chain-smoking, hard-drinking, womanising science geek down to his stick-thin physique. Cillian even admitted to taking on a rather “unhealthy” weight loss regime that he wouldn’t recommend, to transform into the physicist on the intense 57-day shoot. Nolan lets us step inside Oppenheimer’s mind from the off as he contemplates the inner workings of quantum mechanics, something the director and his team expertly achieved without the use of CGI. We also see the scientist in his adulterous private life, his complicated relationship with family members who are signed up Communist party members and his own dealings with the thrilling, yet catastrophic moral conundrums of his amazing discoveries. This is most powerfully felt when Oppenheimer imagines the skin peeling off faces of what he questions are “his” victims, as he steps over the ash-stricken corpses of the atomic wrath he harnessed. This film, full of beautiful IMAX shots and stunning practical effects, is The Imitation Game meets Studio Ghibli's The Winds Rises; a World War II boffin’s race against time to decisively end a conflict, while the paranoia of espionage looms around him. It’s the true story of – as the biography its based on is titled – the American Prometheus building something unimaginable and brutally stunning, the fire of the gods, that ultimately is used for the devastating total annihilation of thousands and perhaps one day millions. Nolan’s script deals with complex themes that open a whole can of difficult discussions that couldn’t be more relevant and terrifying, but it’s not without its problems. In his previous works, Nolan is the master of a tight storyline even if he’s dealing with multiple timelines. Yet Oppenheimer, far from chronological, feels somewhat unfocused and overlong across its dry, overstuffed and incredibly dense three hours. The blockbuster is never boring but there’s enough to fit an HBO miniseries here from the physicist’s private life to his lead of the spectacularly recreated Trinity test, all the way up to being suspected of being a Communist once again in the 1950s. All this occurs in either colour or black and white representing Oppenheimer’s subject personal point of view and the objective external perspective of everyone else. It’s interesting, but yet another layer to a movie that’s already as heavy as a warhead. Robert Downey Jr’s villainous Lewis Strauss, who tries to undo the scientist’s influence and legacy in the pursuit of the hydrogen bomb, is another scene-stealer with a good chance of an Academy Award himself. However, the ensemble cameo cast doesn’t really have enough to do, especially the underdeveloped female leads in Emily Blunt as his wife Kitty and Jean Tatlock star Florence Pugh, whose incredible acting talent is yet again reduced to sexually explicit scenes. Overall, Oppenheimer is a timely film that only manages to occasionally fill the viewer with the explosive terror it intended through the odd stand-out, well-written and visually orchestrated scenes, while the rest is somewhat undermined by its overtly condensed structure. We couldn't help but wonder if Martin Scorsese or Aaron Sorkin would have tackled this biopic's subject matter better. Nevertheless, kudos to Nolan's epic for its main performances and the fact that the moral questions it raises are still very much with us – but will the film itself be in a year’s time?",NEUTRAL
"Jul 19, 2023"," Although it sometimes feels like we’re watching a history textbook or a lengthy biography, writer/director Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a sprawling, visually engrossing cinematic lesson in technology, innovation, American hubris, ego run amok, and just how petty and vindictive men can be when their pride is wounded. Based on the 2006 Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin (and adapted by Nolan), the movie is, above all else, another classic example of science getting so caught up in wondering if something can be done with every possible resource at its disposal that very few actually ask whether it should be done at all. With a cast that has to reach into the hundreds, including more famous or nearly famous faces than I can remember in any film in recent memory, Oppenheimer is effectively the tale of two men who should have been lifelong friends: J. Robert Oppenheimer (played by Nolan mainstay Cillian Murphy) and Lewis Strauss (a truly revelatory Robert Downey Jr.), a founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. For reasons that remain a mystery for most of the movie, Strauss made it his mission to destroy the career and reputation of Oppenheimer many years after the latter led a team of scientists to invent the atomic bomb, the weapon that effectively ended World War II’s war in the Pacific. The film is actually two films, one showing Oppenheimer’s rise through the scientific community, primarily as a theorist more than doing the actual building to test his theories. At once, he was well-respected and deeply resented for his high opinion of himself. He also dabbled in socialist activities and associated with members of the American communist party in the 1930s, and it was these entanglements that some in the government sought to use against him later in life. Oppenheimer’s story is shown in pieces, beginning with his university years, through the Manhattan project. But we also get glimpses from the late 1950s, during the height of the Red Scare, when Oppenheimer and his closest associates and detractors are being relentlessly interrogated about his loyalty to America and whether or not he fed atomic secrets to the Russians. Meanwhile, Strauss is almost exclusively shown in black-and-white sequences revolving around his confirmation hearing to become Secretary of Commerce under Eisenhower, which should have been a cakewalk for him, were it not for a few pesky facts about his years as AEC head and dealings with Oppenheimer. The systematic takedown of both men is at the heart of this fascinating story, but there’s so much more to walk through, and so many dozens more characters to meet. In some ways, Oppenheimer might be Nolan’s most personal film, as a director of almost-academic-quality films, many of which feel like they should come with a mandatory discussion group after each screening, especially in his more recent works like Inception, Interstellar, and Tenet. Oppenheimer believed that genius often afforded him the benefit of the doubt or excused bad behavior (he was a flagrant womanizer), and it’s entirely possible that you will leave this three-hour work deeply despising the man, and not just because he gave the world the keys to its own self-destruction. I’m guessing at times, Nolan himself has felt attacked for making overly intellectual and self-indulgent films, but his admirers are fiercely devoted and quite vocal. Oppenheimer walks us through a couple of the scientist's personal relationships, especially that with his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) and mistress Jean Tarlock (Florence Pugh). Perhaps my favorite supporting character is Gen. Leslie Groves Jr., director of the Manhattan Project (Matt Damon). As soon as Damon enters the film, the tone seems to come to life as the admittedly knowledgeable military man cuts through the dense science. As he did in Air, Damon adds a degree of levity, without resorting to becoming comic relief, and when he breaks a concept down, it sticks in our heads, which is crucial for a story like this that mixes science, morality, and wartime bloodlust. Other key players include Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, and Josh Hartnett as key players in both Oppenheimer’s academic life and colleagues whom he brought into the Manhattan Project. Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Jason Clarke, Tony Goldwyn, Macon Blair, James D’Arcy, Matthew Modine, Alex Wolff, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirlby, Casey Affleck, and Dane DeHaan all pop in from time to time—sometimes just for one scene, sometimes as glorified background players—to make an impression and sell this story and the lead characters. Standout supporting roles belong to Kenneth Branagh as Danish physicist Niels Bohr; Tom Conti as mentor Albert Einstein; David Dastmalchian as Oppenheimer’s primary accuser; and Gary Oldman as President Harry S. Truman. Oppenheimer is filmed in a combination of IMAX 65mm and 65mm large-format film photography including, for the first time ever, sections in IMAX black-and-white analogue photography. Visually, the film is beyond reproach, and it oftentimes reminded me of a less chaotic version of Oliver Stone’s JFK, especially when the visuals combine with frequent time jumps and more artistic (and apparently all in-camera) visual effects that let Oppenheimer’s state of mind become represented in his environment. Some of these scenes are downright nightmare fuel, especially after the first atomic bomb test (which happens at almost exactly the two-hour mark), which clearly shakes him to his core. Almost as soon as the two bombs are dropped on Japan, Oppenheimer is haunted by what he’s done. He’s undeniably proud as well, if only only because he didn’t ignite the atmosphere in the process. But it’s these dueling sentiments that make up the bulk of the third hour of the movie. He doesn’t become an anti-bomb activist, but he does think that using the bomb should have resulted in peace talks with the Russians immediately, rather than further escalation on both sides. He was absolutely right, and nobody wanted to hear it at the time. Some knowledge of Oppenheimer’s history might help understand some of the nuances of the story the film is trying to tell, but I think the film serves better as a jumping-off point to do additional digging into his troubled later years. I’m particularly interested in the community that was built up at Los Alamos, New Mexico (home of the Manhattan Project), and what day-to-day life must have been like for the families of the scientists who moved out there for years. Oppenheimer is less about an enigmatic figure and more about a man driven by multiple (and sometimes conflicting) passions. Murphy and Downey are extraordinary in these roles, and Nolan seems focused, connected to the material, and at the top of his game as an artist. It’s sometimes dry, but a film with this much going on needs to be in order to make the complexities easier to follow. And while I’ve accused Nolan of flopping when it comes to directing emotion in some films, here it seems a dominant presence, and it’s handled beautifully. I’m not sure the rest of the world is ready for a three-hour, R-rated, very grown-up film in the heart of the summer, but I sure was. Did you enjoy this post?

"Jul 19, 2023"," If you thought “Oppenheimer” was just going to be about the origins of the atomic bomb, Christopher Nolan is here to blow up all your expectations. The writer/director’s ambitious and exquisitely crafted biopic (★★★½ out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday) packs a whole lot of movie into three hours, with a dense narrative and an outstanding cast. Cillian Murphy turns in a haunting career-best performance as theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Robert Downey Jr. astounds in a way we haven’t seen in quite some time in an epic that turns a harrowing era of American history into equal parts terrifying horror show, paranoia thriller and political potboiler. Yes, a bomb goes off – a chilling albeit awesome watch in the hands of a master like Nolan – yet it only leads to more storytelling fireworks. Nolan unfurled a plot that coalesced over multiple story lines in 2017's “Dunkirk” and he does so again with “Oppenheimer,"" told through a pair of tales beginning in the 1950s. Facing obstacles to renew his government security clearance, Oppenheimer narrates his own life story in full color, from coming up in the science ranks in Europe to his high-profile work with the Manhattan Project developing an A-bomb before the Nazis and the Russians can. In contrast, the black-and-white second plot line centers on Senate hearings to confirm Lewis Strauss (Downey) as Secretary of Commerce, and the fallout from the former Atomic Energy Commission chairman’s rivalry with Oppenheimer. It’s a slow burn at first, as Oppenheimer becomes a force in quantum mechanics but makes enemies thanks to his bristling personality and close ties to Communist Party members, including his ex, psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold). But entering World War II, those issues are brushed aside, and Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), a hard-charging brigadier general heading up the Manhattan Project, recruits Oppenheimer to be its director. “Oppy,” as his friends and colleagues call him, has a secret lab and town built in New Mexico and, alongside fellow scientists, races to build a bomb. But he becomes increasingly worried about the destructive power that he’s putting in mankind’s hands. Murphy’s character utters the famous quote “Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds,” and Nolan does a grand job of putting that on screen. The amazing ticking-clock leadup to the 1945 Trinity test, the first detonation of a nuclear weapon, melds Hoyte van Hoytema’s stunning cinematography and Ludwig Göransson’s powerful orchestral score, and the blast itself is a sense-rattling moment. But the aftermath is where Nolan digs into Oppenheimer’s moral quandaries and realization that the world has changed forever. After the fateful bombs are dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the scientist addresses cheering Americans, yet also imagines in gruesome fashion what he’s wrought. Murphy wonderfully inhabits the nervy intensity of a gaunt and troubled figure, who's deemed unstable and egoistical by his peers during the war and at wit’s end later, as he contends with politicos with a score to settle. And Emily Blunt brings an honest and volatile energy to Kitty Oppenheimer, a loyal champion for her husband. Nolan’s all-star ensemble (including Rami Malek, Alden Ehrenreich, Benny Safdie and many more) is top notch, though there are so many personalities that it’s hard for them all to pop, even with the extended runtime. Not so for Downey, who brings his significant charm to portray a magnetic antagonist for a change. Stylistically, “Oppenheimer” recalls Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" in the way it weaves together important history and significant side players, and while it doesn't hit the same emotional notes as Nolan's inspired ""Interstellar,"" the film succeeds as both character study and searing cautionary tale about taking science too far. Characters from yesteryear worry about nervously pushing a fateful button and setting the world on fire, although Nolan drives home the point that fiery existential threat could reignite any time now.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan’s “Oppenheimer” is a kinetic thing of dark, imposing beauty that quakes with the disquieting tremors of a forever rupture in the course of human history. “Oppenheimer,” a feverish three-hour immersion in the life of Manhattan Project mastermind J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), is poised between the shock and aftershock of the terrible revelation, as one character calls it, of a divine power. There are times in Nolan’s latest opus that flames fill the frame and visions of subatomic particles flitter across the screen — montages of Oppenheimer’s own churning visions. But for all the immensity of “Oppenheimer,” this is Nolan’s most human-scaled film — and one of his greatest achievements. It’s told principally in close-ups, which, even in the towering detail of IMAX 70mm, can’t resolve the vast paradoxes of Oppenheimer. He was said to be a magnetic man with piercing blue eyes (Murphy has those in spades) who became the father of the atomic bomb but, in speaking against nuclear proliferation and the hydrogen bomb, emerged as America’s postwar conscience. Nolan, writing his own adaptation of Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” layers the build-up to the Manhattan Project with two moments from years later. In 1954, a probing inquiry into Oppenheimer’s leftist politics by a McCarthy-era Atomic Energy Commission stripped him of his security clearance. This provides the frame of “Oppenheimer,” along with a Senate confirmation hearing for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), who chaired the Atomic Energy Commission and was a stealthy nemesis to Oppenheimer. The grubby, political machinations of these hearings — the Strauss section is captured in black and white — act like a stark X-ray of Oppenheimer’s life. It’s an often brutal, unfair interrogation that weighs Oppenheimer’s decisions and accomplishment, inevitably, in moral terms. “Who’d want to justify their whole life?” someone wonders. For the maker of the world’s most lethal weapon, it’s an especially complicated question. These separate timelines give “Oppenheimer” — dimly lit and shadowy even in the desert — a noirish quality (Nolan has said all his films are ultimately noirs) in reckoning with a physicist who spent the first half of his life in headlong pursuit of a new science and the second half wrestling with the consequences of his colossal, world-altering invention.  “Oppenheimer” moves too fast to come to any neat conclusions. Nolan, as if reaching to match the electron, dives into the story at a blistering pace. From start to finish, “Oppenheimer” buzzes with a heady frequency, tracking Oppenheimer as a promising student in the then-unfolding field of quantum mechanics. “Can you hear the music, Robert?” asks the elder Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh). He can, absolutely, but that doesn’t mean finding harmony. Nolan, whose last film was the time-traveling, palindrome-rich “Tenet,” may be the only filmmaker for whom delving into quantum mechanics could be considered a step down in complexity. But “Oppenheimer” is less interested in equations than the chemistry of an expanding mind. Oppenheimer reads “The Waste Land” and looks at modernist painting. He dabbles in the communist thinking of the day. (His mistress, Jean Tatlock, played arrestingly, tragically by Florence Pugh, is a party member.) But he aligns with no single cause. “I like a little wiggle room,” says Oppenheimer. For a filmmaker synonymous with grand architectures — psychologies mapped onto subconscious worlds (“Inception”) and cosmic reaches ( “Interstellar” ) — “Oppenheimer” resides more simply in its subject’s fertile imagination and anguished psyche. (The script was written in first person.) Nolan and cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema render Oppenheimer’s interiority with flashes of images that stretch across the heavens. His brilliance comes from his limitlessness of thought.  Just how much “wiggle room” Oppenheimer is permitted, though, becomes a more acute point when war breaks out and he’s tasked by Lt. Gen. Leslie Groves Jr. (Matt Damon) to lead the race to beat the Nazis to an atomic bomb. The rapid building of Los Alamos on the white-sand mesas of New Mexico — a site chosen by and with personal meaning to Oppenheimer — might not be so different than the erecting of movie sets for Nolan’s massive films, which likewise tend to culminate with a spectacular explosion. There is something inherently queasy about a big-screen spectacle dramatizing the creation — justified or not — of a weapon of mass destruction. Oppenheimer once called the atomic bomb “a weapon for aggressors” wherein “the elements of surprise and terror are as intrinsic to it as are the fissionable nuclei.” Surely a less imperial, leviathan filmmaker than Nolan — a British director making an American epic — might have approached the subject differently. But the responsibility of power has long been one of Nolan’s chief subjects (think of the all-powerful surveillance machine of “The Dark Knight”). And “Oppenheimer” is consumed with not just the ethical quandary of the Manhattan Project but every ethical quandary that Oppenheimer encounters. Big or small, they could all lead to valor or damnation. What makes “Oppenheimer” so unnerving is how indistinguishable one is from the other. “Oppenheimer” sticks almost entirely to its protagonist’s point of view yet also populates its three-hour film with an incredible array of faces, all in exquisite detail. Some of the best are Benny Safdie as the hydrogen bomb designer Edward Teller; Jason Clarke as gruff special counsel Roger Robb; Gary Oldman as President Harry Truman; Alden Ehrenreich as an aide to Strauss; Macon Blair as Oppenheimer’s attorney; and Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, the physicist’s wife. The greatest of all of them, though, is Murphy. The actor, a Nolan regular, has always been able to communicate something more disturbing underneath his angular, angelic features. But here, his Oppenheimer is a fascinating coil of contradictions: determined and aloof, present and far-away, brilliant but blind. Dread hangs over him, and over the film, with the inevitable. The future, post-Hiroshima, is sounded most by the wail of children who will grow up in that world; the Oppenheimers’ babies do nothing but cry. When the Trinity test comes at Los Alamos after the toil of some 4,000 people and the expense of $2 billion, there’s a palpable, shuddering sense of history changing inexorably. How Nolan captures these sequences — the quiet before the sound of the explosion; the disquieting, thunderous, flag-waving applause that greets Oppenheimer after — are masterful, unforgettable fusions of sound and image, horror and awe. “Oppenheimer” has much more to go. Government encroaches on science, with plenty of lessons for today’s threats of annihilation. Downey, in his best performance in years, strides toward the center of the film. You could say the film gets bogged down here, relegating a global story to a drab backroom hearing, preferring to vindicate Oppenheimer’s legacy rather than wrestle with harder questions of fallout. But “Oppenheimer” is never not balanced, uncomfortably, with wonder at what humans are capable of, and fear that we don’t know what to do with it.  “Oppenheimer,” a Universal Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for some sexuality, nudity and language. Running time: 180 minutes. Four stars out of four.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," 
	Nolan’s movie is set right at the start but serves as a fascinating glimpse into those who had it in them to pull off this remarkable feat but also had to live with its consequences, something we all have to live with today in a shaky time where the nuclear threat has sadly not gone away but only brought the doomsday clock closer to midnight than ever. How many times lately have we heard Putin try to make its use in Ukraine a possibility, even pointing out the Americans have been the only ones to ever use it — so far? 
	It is not a spoiler to reveal that Nolan ultimately chose not to show the horrific results of what happened the first time the Americans dropped that A-bomb over Japan. Instead we see it played out through Oppenheimer’s haunted eyes, a far more effective and chilling approach, achieved with some superior special effects married to music (Ludwig Göransson did the pulsating score) and superb, ear-rattling sound design. This ultimately is not an action spectacle or bomb-dropping war movie but a very human one in which its title character faces a moral dilemma shared by few in history, if anyone. 
	Oppenheimer’s story is told in non-linear style, shuffling back and forth to different periods in time, his own tale shot in color and told in first person, the later trials explaining how it all happened from various points of view shot in striking 65MM black-and-white film — particularly Robert Downey Jr.‘s cagey Lewis Strauss, who was the founding commissioner of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and later a Cabinet appointee as Secretary of Commerce in the Eisenhower administration.  
	Although they are two key players here, Nolan has made a very dense film with a very large and starry cast — three recent Best Actor Oscar winners have small supporting roles, if that gives you an idea — the kind we used to see in ambitious Hollywood films by great directors but not so much lately, at least on this intellectual scale. Matt Damon is excellent as Leslie Groves, the Army officer who was director of the Manhattan Project and brought Oppenheimer into it; Emily Blunt is riveting as Kitty Oppenheimer, his  wife (on  her fourth marriage) but the one who clearly was his match; Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock, with whom he had a sizzling but tragic affair; Josh Hartnett is full of his own energy as the lively friend and nuclear scientist Ernest Lawrence; Kenneth Branagh is Niels Bohr, a Nobel Prize winner in physics who serves as sort of a mentor; Benny Safdie is great as Edward Teller, the theoretical physicist who pushed further into development the terrifying H-bomb, something Oppenheimer vehemently opposed; and on and on. 
	Shout-outs as well to David Dastmalchian as William Borden, a zealous nuclear advocate; Jason Clarke as Roger Robb, who was Special Counsel at the 1954 hearing to deny Oppenheimer’s security clearance; Tony Goldwyn as Atomic Energy Chairman Gordon Gray; and Jefferson Hall as Haakon Chevalier, a key early friend of Oppenheimer’s. Veteran actor Tom Conti also is simply terrific in his few scenes as Albert Einstein, a famous confidant of Oppenheimer’s. Casting director John Papsidera should get plaudits for helping to put together this far ranging cast of fine actors, way too many to mention here.  
	At three hours, there is a lot of story to tell here, and Nolan condenses it nicely and really moves this along with the pace of the best thrillers. The scene where the big first Trinity test of the bomb occurs in the New Mexico desert is pulse-pounding suspense (no one knew when the button was pushed what its effect on the Earth’s atmosphere would be), aided significantly by the razor-sharp editing of Jennifer Lame and ace cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema, working for the fourth time with Nolan. But this is a movie where you never look at your watch no matter what the running time. Murphy gets the deserved role of a lifetime and really captures all the contradictions of this brilliant, tortured, complicated man. Downey gets his best role in years, a real standout as well.  
	From a man who has taken us into places movies rarely go with such films as Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, Memento,the Dark Knight Trilogy, and a very different but equally effective look at World War II in Dunkirk, I think it would be fair to say Oppenheimer could be Christopher Nolan’s most impressive achievement to date. I have heard it described by one person as a lot of scenes with men sitting around talking. Indeed, in another iteration Nolan could have turned this into a play, but this is a movie, and if there is a lot of “talking,” well he has invested in it such a signature cinematic and breathtaking sense of visual imagery that you just may be on the edge of your seat the entire time.  
	Hopefully people will see it in a theater, a place of worship for people like Nolan and me. It was made on the biggest film stock possible and meant for the largest screens, but it isn’t mere summertime escapist entertainment like most of the movies in large formats these days. At the very least, it is a necessary reminder that we are still sitting on the powder keg Oppenheimer and his team created, and we still need to heed his warnings, maybe now more than ever.

"Jul 19, 2023",Like its protagonist&#44; Oppenheimer is a work in constant conflict with itself&#44; with most of its problems rooted in Nolan&#8217;s screenplay&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Only the brilliant mind behind “Memento,” “Inception” and the “Dark Knight” trilogy would conclude that a biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, could be both a morally complex, informative, gripping drama and a mind-blowing visual feast.  Of course, we anticipate that the first-ever nuclear bomb test, outside Los Alamos, New Mexico, in 1945, will justify the movie’s massive scale. And that paralyzing scene definitely does. But “Oppenheimer” is explosive well before and well after the actual explosion.  What keeps all three hours of the film so breathlessly tense is the title physicist’s internal tug of war: Can the valiant quest for scientific advancement — his great passion — lead to the total destruction of the planet?  And is he culpable for whatever happens, as the leader of the team who created the A-bomb over three years in secret in the Southwest? Or is it the person who decides to push the button, a k a the leader of the free world? As the chilly man considers these thorny questions — and also has moments of euphoric inspiration — Nolan throws in loud images from Oppenheimer’s mind, of atoms violently splitting, or of flames engulfing the screen. The cacophony shown inside Oppenheimer’s head fascinatingly clashes with Murphy’s outwardly stoic, privately vulnerable performance. He mesmerizingly journeys from intellectual force of nature to a guilt-plagued, damaged shadow of a man.  Like many of those on college campuses in the first half of the 20th century, Oppenheimer socialized with socialists, and the government attempted to use his past against him when he became outspoken against the hydrogen bomb after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki that climaxed World War II.  Throughout the movie, we jump in and out of the infamous, behind-closed-doors kangaroo court to decide if he was a Communist who had been disloyal to the United States.  But what separates the director from most of his fellow auteurs nowadays is he knows vision alone cannot make a great movie — you need terrific performances to carry it out. And every supporting turn here is a smash. Emily Blunt is focused and biting as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty, who’s fiercely supportive even though he gives her plenty of reasons not to be, such as his Commie ex Jean, played with frayed wires by Florence Pugh.  It speaks to the caliber of this cast that there’s not enough room to praise the excellent Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck and Rami Malek, all of whom make a porterhouse out of a slice of roast beef. The three-hour runtime will scare off some people (even though that’s breezy these days if you’re James Cameron or Martin Scorsese), but the subject matter and artfulness of Nolan’s approach earn our attention every single second. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Starring Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt and Matt Damon amid an ensemble cast, Oppenheimer is the latest film by Inception director Christopher Nolan. The film follows the creator of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Murphy), whose work led to the invention of the first nuclear weapons during World War II. Based on American Prometheus, a biography that was developed over 25 years by  Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the extensive source material allows Nolan to embody a wealth of history in his latest feature. In a gargantuan 180 minutes, the biopic covers various eras of Oppenheimer’s life as a celebrated scientist, only to eventually become ostracised for his opposition to the use of advanced weapons.  At the start, Oppenheimer’s curiosity and dedication to science imply a need to put theory into practice – especially when he becomes a pioneering theoretical physicist. A troubled genius with grandiose ideals and theories that place him beyond his peers, he develops a deep dedication to his work and an admiration for other physicists around the world that collectively inspire him to take his love of science to higher, unimaginable levels. But his growing influence in the scientific community only feeds his arrogance, especially as his interest in foreign politics, more notably communism, becomes increasingly prominent as it paints a target on his back during the temperamental times of World War II. The fact that he is assigned the role of a project leader to essentially create a bomb, aka a weapon of mass destruction, isn’t as apparent to his drive for science. Actually, it becomes more of an afterthought until the success of his project quickly sobers upon the devastating impact of Hiroshima. Combined with the heft of American politics at this time and the future of nuclear weaponry, the narrative evokes a sombre and devastating feeling that echoes the emotional impact of his endeavour. Though necessary, his conflict between political activist and scientist becomes an underlying yet hefty source of contention in the narrative because it convolutes Oppenheimer’s life and achievements with the inclusion of multiple different characters. From military officials and government agents to friends and colleagues, they all spin a thread of a huge and elaborate web that makes it difficult to engage with them – unless the audience is up-to-date with American history of this era, the film paints the majority of these characters as passing mentions in the physicist’s life. In terms of notable supporting roles, Robert Downey Jr. delivers the biggest punch as Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. Similar to Murphy, he brings a complex performance as the admiring businessman to the cutthroat puppeteer behind the film’s excruciating security hearings, igniting a slow-burning tale of Oppenheimer’s downfall. Two additional characters who garner some of Oppenheimer‘s attention are its two female characters, both of whom are integral but ultimately become victims of his work. His on-off lover Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) provides a timely escape that deepens Oppenheimer’s connection with the Communist Party while his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) becomes a resentful alcoholic housewife. Although they have a mixed impact on the narrative and their significance to the eponymous character – Oppenheimer‘s nude scenes, in particular, come across as gratuitous and a waste of Pugh’s talents – both performances enable an intimacy amid Oppenheimer‘s intense narrative and emphasise his persona as a man. As for its leading man, Oppenheimer reaffirms Cillian Murphy’s remarkable talent as an actor and highlights one of the more understated actor-filmmaker partnerships in cinema. In his first lead role in a Christopher Nolan film, Murphy is magnetic as Oppenheimer. His enigmatic performance has touches of subtlety, calculation and determination so he easily eclipses the rest of the film’s extensive cast, which rivals a Wes Anderson film in terms of star power. Combining three linear narratives is no easy feat, but Nolan achieves it brilliantly through his strong and passion-fuelled screenplay. Visually, he sporadically scatters brightly coloured flashes that reflect his brilliance and fascination with physics, constantly reminding audiences of Oppenheimer’s first and truest love – science. While films such as Interstellar and Tenet have allowed him to play with the laws of time and space, Oppenheimer allows him to further indulge his love of science with a historical spin to deliver his most accessible film to date. But he doesn’t compromise his ambitious visual and storytelling styles, the former of which is epitomised in one of the film’s key scenes  – the Trinity Test, which is amazingly recreated through practical effects that effectively evoke the mind-blowing scale of the detonation. The result is beyond spectacular on the big screen. The immense depth and history of the eponymous character radiate through Nolan’s intricate direction – even after the dust settles, Oppenheimer‘s attention to detail lingers long after the credits roll. Audiences may argue about the runtime and may have to compete against a certain doll at the box office, but even these do not diminish the staggering impact of Nolan’s epic biopic and its ability to engross audiences into the complicated life of its challenging eponymous character. Overall, it is a breathtaking piece of cinema.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," On July 16, 1945, at 5:29 a.m., the world changed forever. The Trinity Test (aka the world’s first nuclear explosion), carried out in secret on a plot of empty land smack dab in the middle of New Mexico and overseen by Julius Robert Oppenheimer, proved the atomic bomb was a viable weapon of mass destruction. You can draw a direct line from that moment to the bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the nuclear arms race that defined the Cold War, and the looming threat of self-assured nuclear annihilation that persists even today. So you might naturally think that the Trinity Test would be the most important scene in Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan’s new movie about the so-called father of the atomic bomb. And in a way, it is. The explosion serves as the film’s climax, a visual gut punch that releases two hours of tension and kicks off Oppenheimer’s unexpected third act. But in another sense, that fateful test is the least important part of the movie: a brief detour into blockbuster spectacle in what’s otherwise Nolan’s most grounded, contemplative, and beautiful film to date. Oppenheimer plays out on three parallel tracks, though its structure becomes clearer as the movie chugs tirelessly forward. The core story follows Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy giving the performance of his life in the role he was apparently born to play) as he matures from a directionless physics student to one of the most brilliant minds of his generation. It’s not long before he’s recruited by Lt. Gen. Leslie Richard Groves (Matt Damon sporting a killer mustache) to lead the Manhattan Project as America races to build a nuke faster than the Nazis.  The story jumps rapidly between time and space as Oppenheimer assembles a team of scientists as formidable as any superhero ensemble. But while most of the drama plays out in drab meeting rooms and scribbled-on whiteboards, Nolan uses swirling practical effects (fire, stars, and light commingle in a haunting cosmic dance) to illuminate both the theoretical physics and the chaos that exists within his protagonist’s head. Providing some loose narrative framework are a pair of secondary plotlines set in the film’s future. In one, Oppenheimer answers leading questions about his Communist ties in a government hearing designed to humiliate him. (In other scenes, we see him flirting with Communism and working to organize his fellow academics in an unexpected parallel to the actor and writer strikes currently grinding Hollywood to a halt.) In another, Oppenheimer’s rival Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr. doing some of his best acting in decades) finds himself in a heated political battle to become U.S. secretary of commerce. If that last bit sounds boring, don’t worry: Downey sells it with a series of speeches that put his best Iron Man monologue to shame. The story of Strauss, with its many twists and deceptions, transforms Oppenheimer from moody biopic into gripping legal thriller, fusing the best parts of Nolan’s original mind-bender Memento with all the technical skills and Hollywood might he’s accumulated in the decades since. (In a nod to Memento, Downey’s scenes play out in black and white, denoting that they’re the only ones not shown to us through Oppenheimer’s own perspective.) Scenes narrated by rival Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) are shown in black and white, distinguishing them from the rest of the movie shown from Oppenheimer’s perspective. Eventually, at roughly the two-hour mark if you’re wondering, Oppenheimer gets to the explosion. Nolan builds tension masterfully, slathering it on like the scientists applying sunscreen as they prepare to bathe in their bomb’s nuclear glow. But when the moment comes, it’s almost anti-climactic. Nolan isolates the individual elements: blinding light, a tower of fire, and finally, a sonic boom. Combined, they are death incarnate, but individually, they may fail to impress. And yet, I can’t help but feel that’s the point of Oppenheimer. This is not a celebration of scientific ingenuity, American might, or even the defeat of evil. (The movie makes it clear that the Nazis were already defeated before the Trinity Test and the Japanese were likely close to surrender.) Rather, it’s a brutal condemnation of everyone and everything that helped make nuclear weapons a reality. As the movie’s final act slowly whirs to life (audiences may groan briefly when they realize there’s still an hour left after the explosion), Robert Oppenheimer transforms into an anti-war activist. But it’s too little too late, and Nolan makes this clear: Oppenheimer is no redemption story. While the trio of Murphy, Damon, and Downey carry the weight of Nolan’s vision on their backs, Oppenheimer’s entire ensemble cast deserves praise. When the movie was first announced, it seemed the director was simply scooping up every star he could find (Rami Malek! Florence Pugh! Josh Hartnett! Benny Safdie!), but each actor seems born to play their given role. Safdie is a clear standout as Edward Teller, a rogue Manhattan Project scientist whose work leads to the even deadlier hydrogen bomb. Emily Blunt also shines as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, despite not being given a ton of depth beyond a drinking problem and one stellar scene. And Gary Oldman’s brief portrayal of Harry Truman as a truly deplorable human being is one for the history books. But the true star of Oppenheimer is history itself, both in the movie’s slavish devotion to it and in the harsh truths it so often uncovers.  After making his name with a trio of Batman movies followed by a trio of science fiction epics, Nolan’s ability to craft a biopic wasn’t a sure thing. On my way to the theater, I worried this would be 2.5 hours of boring dialogue followed by one spectacular explosion. (Instead, it turned out the opposite was true.) After watching Oppenheimer, I’d trust Nolan to direct a movie about the inventor of the doorknob if that’s what he wants to do next. Oppenheimer is a tour de force. An unmatched director at the top of his game throwing off the shackles of science fiction and superheroes to tell the raw story of one man’s transformation into something both more and less than a human being. It’s a potent political allegory and a surprisingly timely endorsement of workers’ rights. But more than anything else, Oppenheimer is a damn good movie.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," On August 6th and August 9th, 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in both a display of the awesome power of the weapon and in the hopes of ending World War II in a more literal sense, as well as preventing future wars. The initial bombings are said to have killed an estimated 110,000, with another 100,000 reportedly dying due to the effects of the bombs in subsequent years. The gravity of these deaths cannot be overstated or overlooked, and with Oppenheimer, filmmaker Christopher Nolan showcases not only the power of innovation that humanity can accomplish when the greatest minds are brought together, but also how quickly other minds can betray those who carried out their wishes.  The promising mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) is offered the chance to pursue his interests in quantum physics, only for Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to enlist Oppenheimer to help develop an atomic bomb, due to reports that other countries are developing a similar weapon during World War II. Oppenheimer and wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), along with his most trusted scientists, build the community of Los Alamos, whose residents are tasked with arguably the most significant and civilization-defining weapon in history. Interspersed with this journey is the chronicling of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), one of Oppenheimer's former confidants, being questioned in his pursuit to become a member of Dwight D. Eisenhower's presidential cabinet, unraveling the details of his falling out with Oppenheimer. Whether it be murder mysteries like Memento and Insomnia, his work in the superhero genre with three Batman films, or his more ambitious experiments like Inception and Tenet, there are few contemporary directors who can captivate an audience like Christopher Nolan. No matter what the subject matter might be, the scripts he brings to life, the pacing of his cuts, and the intensity of his performers make for experiences that you can't look away from. Even though many audiences might know J. Robert Oppenheimer for his connection to the atomic bomb (which the explosion-filled marketing campaigns continue to remind us about), the actual experience of the film is hardly concerned with such a monumental development. Most viewers likely know how the calculations and experimentations will pan out, with Nolan -- who also scripted the picture, based on Kai Bird's book American Prometheus -- instead focusing on the literal and figurative interrogations and accusations that Oppenheimer was subjected to, just out of his civic duty. The first two acts showcase the humanity of Oppenheimer, thanks in large part to the compelling nature of Cillian Murphy's performance. The actor is often one of the highlights of any project he takes part in, and while he could easily deliver all manner of acting tropes as he carries the story, both his and Nolan's restraint paint a much more nuanced picture of a man who knows he has gifts that others would trade anything for. Oppenheimer would much rather toil away in the world of quantum physics, but knowing that he understands the science better than anyone else means that he's obligated, both to his country and to humanity itself, to be the one to harness the power of the atomic bomb. Despite this devotion, he's still a conflicted man, as he dabbles with members of the American Communist Party and has a complicated romantic relationship with Jean Tatlock, played by the always-charming Florence Pugh. Whatever it was that inspired it, Oppenheimer became a martyr who carried that title with him as far as he had to.  The last act of the film fully embraces that martyrdom, trading in the awe-inspiring development of a world-changing weapon for the bureaucracy of what happens when you don't fall in line with the rest of the company. In his first major post-Marvel role, Robert Downey Jr. showcases everything that made him a star for multiple decades. He's cold, calculating, charming, and coercive. Audiences are left guessing whether he is a supporter of Oppenheimer who is being dragged down for those allegiances or if he's pulling strings to benefit from a fallen comrade's downfall. With an ensemble cast featuring the talents of Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Kenneth Branagh, Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, and David Dastmalchian, just to name a fraction of the film's stars, everyone gets the chance to do some capital-A Acting. Given the nature of the storyline, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh take a backseat to virtually every male star, but they make their presences known at every opportunity.  Nolan uses this impressively talented cavalcade of stars to explore the human condition and the doors that can either be opened or shut, based on your heritage, political affiliations, gender, or socioeconomic status. Keeping more in line with these internalized themes is his visual approach to Oppenheimer, which is a far cry from the spectacles he's delivered in previous outings. While a film like Dunkirk was based on true events, it was still an experience that delivered bombast akin to other war epics. Oppenheimer trades the shock and awe for a micro scale, delivering visuals that are abstract depictions of what happens at atomic levels in both humans and in weapons of mass destruction. The inherent nature of the premise and its real-life ramifications also means that the audience is unsettled by the looming threat of explosive tests, knowing the human toll these sequences might take. While viewers may have hooted and hollered at last year's Top Gun: Maverick for its dogfights and militaristic spectacle, Oppenheimer braces audiences for a bomb going off, as it represents not only hundreds of thousands of deaths, but also the advancement of thermonuclear war in perpetuity.  Dating back to 2008's The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan has embraced IMAX cameras to immerse audiences in the tension of pulse-pounding sequences, but with Oppenheimer, the most harrowing moments are when Cillian Murphy conveys the internal trauma he grapples with. Not only does he have to cope with romantic trysts and the questioning of loyalties to his country, but also the oppressive nature of the curse he's bringing into the world. While one minute he might be hoisted upon shoulders and applauded for a job well done, the next minute will see him grappling with being fortunate enough to have developed the bomb instead of being one of its thousands of victims. The cast and crew of Oppenheimer have made note that the film often feels like a horror movie at times, with those emotional horrors being far more explosive and disquieting than any image related to a bomb going off. Those visuals are only heightened by the sound design, as the audience experiences a similarly oppressive assault on the senses as what the characters endure. Another tool in Nolan's toolbox is the juxtaposition between color and black-and-white photography, which helps differentiate between Oppenheimer's perspective and then those outside of his own point of view. Longtime Nolan fans will remember this formula from his Memento, with both films using this technique in a more practical sense for the movie's overall structure as opposed to an ambitious aesthetic experiment. It's also worth noting that, with a run time of three hours, it marks Nolan's longest film yet, and while there are surely lulls, the pacing is overall effective, as a majority of the experience is jumping from one scene of talented performers to the next. Between his The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk, and to some extent Tenet, Nolan has a penchant for delivering massive experiences in the summer months, with Oppenheimer earning the expectation of following suit, whether it wants to earn that stigma or not. The film is, instead, the anti-summer spectacle, not only because of its emphasis on internalized conflicts but also due to its downright depressing and disturbing subject matter. Even if a movie like Dunkirk similarly depicted real-life horrors of war, there's some escapism in how Nolan stages a scene and depicts those atrocities. Oppenheimer might feature one of Nolan's best casts, but it's also the least audience-friendly narrative. A case could be made that it is Nolan's most important film, not only because of its overall messages about disregard for human casualties, governmental manipulation, and bureaucratic betrayal, but also because it's ultimately a cautionary tale about the relentless ravages of war. Despite its importance, it's hard to say there's much about the film that's necessarily entertaining in a more surface-level sense, which is sure to alienate both casual moviegoers and Nolan fanatics alike. After a long string of crowd-pleasers that also manage to inject ambitious philosophical and existential components, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan's most intellectual and internal experience in years. It showcases the universality of humanistic struggles without hingeing upon them entirely, while also subtly yet exponentially layering in explicit critiques of global war machines. Despite chronicling events that unfolded 70 years ago, exploring an arms race or being given conflicting information by government authorities and being expected to honor ever-changing ideologies feels immensely contemporary. With Oppenheimer, Nolan orchestrates a talented symphony of performers at the top of their game to explore an overlooked corner of history, treating it with nuance and respect while lesser hands would lean into melodrama. The movie is a tribute not only to the true-life figures who pushed the limits of science forward, but also to those who suffered the consequences of those forward-thinkers' quest for fire. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," 
	Cillian Murphy gives a phenomenal performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, who oversaw creation of the atomic bomb, in a film that's ruthlessly authentic and, for much of its three hours, gripping.  
	In the early scenes of “Oppenheimer,” J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), an American physics student attending graduate school in England and Germany in the 1920s, with bright blue marble eyes and a curly wedge of hair that stands up like Charlie Chaplin’s, keeps having visions of particles and waves. We see the images that are disrupting his mind, the particles pulsating, the waves aglow in vibratory bands of light. Oppenheimer can see the brave new world of quantum physics, and the visual razzmatazz is exactly the sort of thing you’d expect from a biopic written and directed by Christopher Nolan: a molecular light show as a reflection of the hero’s inner spirit. 
	The film opens with a flash forward to the 1954 hearing of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission that ultimately resulted in Oppenheimer, accused (among other things) of having hidden Communist ties, being stripped of his security clearance. This was the government’s way of silencing him, since in the postwar world he’d become something of a dove on the issue of nuclear weapons, a view that didn’t mesh with America’s Cold War stance of aggression. The hearing was the darkest chapter of Oppenheimer’s life, and using it as a framing device feels, at first, like a very standard thing to do. 
	Except that the film keeps returning to the hearing, weaving it deep into the fabric of its three-hour running time. Lewis Strauss, played with a captivating bureaucratic terseness by Robert Downey Jr., is the A.E.C. chairman who became Oppenheimer’s ideological and personal enemy (after Oppenheimer humiliated him during a congressional testimonial), and he’s the secret force behind the hearing, which takes place in a back room hidden away from the press. As Oppenheimer defends himself in front of a committee of hanging judges, the movie uses his anecdotes to flash back in time, and Nolan creates a hypnotic multi-tiered storytelling structure, using it to tease out the hidden continuities that shaped Oppenheimer’s life and his creation of the bomb. 
	In the ’30s, Oppenheimer, already a legend in his own mind, brings quantum mechanics to the U.S., even as his field of passion encompasses Picasso, Freud, and Marx, not to mention the absorbing of half a dozen languages (from Dutch to Sanskrit), all to soak up the revolutionary energy field that’s sweeping the world, influencing everything from physics to workers’ liberation. Oppenheimer isn’t a Communist, but he’s a devoted leftist with many Communists in his life, from his brother and sister-and-law to his doleful bohemian mistress, Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). What really makes his eyes go bright is when the atom gets split by two German scientists, in 1938. He at first insists it’s not possible, but then his colleagues at Berkeley, led by Ernest Lawrence (Josh Hartnett), demonstrate that it is, and he realizes in an instant where all this points: to the possibility of a bomb. 
	“Oppenheimer” has a mesmerizing first half, encompassing everything from Oppenheimer’s mysterious Princeton encounter with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) to his far from utopian marriage to the alcoholic Kitty (played with scalding force by Emily Blunt). Just about everything we see is stunning in its accuracy. “Oppenheimer” isn’t a movie that traffics in composite characters or audience-friendly arcs; Nolan channels the grain of reality, the fervor and detail of what really happened. And the buildup to the creation of the first atomic bomb just about ticks with cosmic suspense. There are Soviet spies at Los Alamos, as well as a sinister comic grace note: the possibility (“a little more than zero”) that the chain reaction begun by the nuclear explosion could spread to the earth’s atmosphere and never stop, an apocalypse that theoretical physics can’t totally rule out. 
	But the big bang itself, when it finally arrives, as the bomb is tested in the wee hours of that fateful day code-named Trinity, is, I have to say, a letdown. Nolan shows it impressionistically — the sound cutting out, images of what look like radioactive hellfire. But the terrifying awesomeness, the nightmare bigness of it all, does not come across. Nor does it evoke the descriptions of witnesses who say that the blast was streaked with purple and gray and was many times brighter than the noonday sun. 
	And once Oppenheimer shoots past that nuclear climax, a certain humming intensity leaks out of the movie. We’re still at the damn A.E.C. hearing (after two hours), and the film turns into a woeful meditation on what the bomb meant, whether it should have been dropped, our rivalry with the Soviets, and how Oppenheimer figured into all of that, including his relegation to the status of defrocked Cold War scapegoat. What happened to Oppenheimer, at the height of the McCarthy era, was nothing less than egregious (though it’s relevant that he was never officially convicted of disloyalty). At the same time, there are scenes in which characters take him to task for his vanity, for making the bomb all about him. In one of them, he’s dressed down by no less than President Harry Truman (an unbilled Gary Oldman). Is Truman right? 
	The most radically authentic line in the movie may be the one where Oppenheimer, just after the Nazis have been defeated, explains to a room full of young Los Alamos scientists why he feels it’s still justifiable to use the bomb on Japan. We all know the dogmatic lesson we learned in high school: that dropping those bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended the war and saved the lives of countless U.S. soldiers. From the age of 15, I’ve never bought the rationale of that argument. But I buy what Oppenheimer says here: that by using a nuclear weapon, we would create a horrific demonstration of why it could never, ever be used again. (It’s not that that’s a justification. It’s that it’s an explanation of why it happened.)",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan is drawn to stories about obsessive men, men who are consumed by their callings — space travel, dream stealing, stage magic — even when it comes at a catastrophic cost. J. Robert Oppenheimer is the latest of these men, though in this case his focus is one the world is willing to bend itself around. When Robert, played in Oppenheimer by Cillian Murphy at his most angular, gets appointed as head of the Manhattan Project, he has a whole town built at the remote site so the scientists he recruits won’t have to leave their families behind in order to develop the nuclear bomb. Even the location of Los Alamos, which he selects himself, is dear to him. “When I was a kid, I thought if I could find a way to combine physics and New Mexico, my life would be perfect,” he muses while on one of his trips out there to ride horses through the mountains. Robert has it all for a while, though the price turns out to be so much higher than he could have imagined. Oppenheimer is a movie so sprawling it’s difficult to contend with. It’s rich, uncompromising, and borderline unwieldy, but more than anything, it’s a tragedy of operatic grandeur despite so many of its scenes consisting of men talking in rooms — conference rooms, Senate chambers, university classrooms, and emptied-out restaurants, all the prosaic places where the fate of the earth gets hashed out. Its scope comes from Murphy’s haunted performance and the way the movie (with help from Ludwig Göransson’s panic attack of a score) submerges you in the mind-set of its protagonist as though it can create a psychic connection to the past. Robert isn’t an easy character to understand; he’s arrogant, blunt, and aloof and possesses an intelligence about the unseen world of physics that makes him seem half-alien. But Nolan doesn’t want Robert to be relatable. He just wants to explore how his flawed humanity co-exists with his genius in what is ultimately a film about moral slippage and how someone who feels so certain of his own clear-eyed ideals finds himself standing in front of a screaming crowd celebrating the deaths of thousands of people in Japan. The earlier Nolan film that Oppenheimer has the most resonance with isn’t one of those studies of obsessive men but his other work about World War II, Dunkirk. If Dunkirk was about the collective urge that spurs individual acts of heroism and sacrifice in the face of death, Oppenheimer is about how that same force can push people to act against what they believe is right. While it doesn’t go for the same temporal trickery as Dunkirk, Oppenheimer does skip between timelines, hopping between a linear account of Robert’s life from his college days, the 1954 security hearings engineered by a resentful Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr., overplaying the wiliness), and Strauss’s own confirmation hearings for secretary of Commerce in 1959. The latter scenes are shot in a black-and-white that gives them a paradoxical feeling of modernity, as though the feverish days of discovery and unity were in the past, and the future is one for bureaucrats, rather than visionaries. Beginning with Robert’s time as a rising star on campus and a left-wing dabbler, there’s a constant flow of figures through his life, and rather than streamline them, Nolan allows the names and faces to become a disorienting barrage. It works because Robert himself is the still point in the film’s turning world and because Nolan puts people with distinctive faces in these dozens of smaller roles. Oppenheimer is a testament to the power of casting and how much an actor’s look and presence alone can fill out a character. David Dastmalchian, with his glorious hangdog mug, is Robert’s betrayer, William Borden, while Benny Safdie is memorably abrasive as H-bomb pioneer Edward Teller. David Krumholtz, as physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi, is a standout for providing Robert with tender, down-to-earth counsel, while Jason Clarke preens as the menacing attorney Roger Robb. Josh Hartnett is Robert’s frustrated counterpart Ernest Lawrence, Kenneth Branagh is a jolly Niels Bohr, Rami Malek turns up in a small but key role as David Hill, and James Urbaniak — it would basically be illegal to make this movie without James Urbaniak — shows up in a wordless appearance as a frightened Kurt Gödel. In a meatier part, Matt Damon is the impatient Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, who has the cat-herding task of managing Robert but ultimately reveals himself to be an ally. There are women in the movie too, though not many. Emily Blunt brings an air of old Hollywood and an impressive bitterness to the part of Robert’s wife, Kitty, a mercurial alcoholic who was with someone else when they first met. As Jean Tatlock, the troubled grad student, psychiatrist, and Communist Party member with whom Robert has an off-and-on romance, Florence Pugh is just playing a dead-wife type in waiting. Nolan has never been great with female characters, but it matters less in a movie that is so much about men making momentous decisions for everyone else while pretending they aren’t bringing their own histories and personal baggage to the table. Lewis, meanwhile, goes from Robert’s alleged admirer to his stealth foe after a petty humiliation, all those grand ideals about the good of the country and the world subsumed in a desire for power and revenge. Real power is found in those closed-off rooms, not out in the New Mexico desert where the first nuclear weapon was detonated. But when Oppenheimer does show the Trinity test, it’s a feat of monstrous awe, especially in Imax. A vast column of fire casts an unearthly glow on the faces in the audience, like a mirror of the characters onscreen crouched in the dirt clutching plates of welder’s glass to peer through. It’s terrible and splendid, a weapon meant to be so frightening that it would end the use of weapons forever — though, of course, that didn’t happen. Did Robert really believe it would, or had he deluded himself in the moment to justify the thrill of invention? Oppenheimer suggests it was unclear even to him until he’s confronted with the stomping feet of an ecstatic crowd cheering his name. That pounding, which recurs throughout the film, could just as easily be the sound of soldiers marching off to another war — the specter of which, it turns out, can’t be banished, even by the sight of destruction so terrible it leaves its creator forever haunted.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The director Christopher Nolan has never told a true story. His 2017 war film, Dunkirk, dealt with real things, but Nolan’s work has largely been less about people than about the spectacle swirling around them, the awe and terror they experience as reality bends and new consciousness blooms. (He’s also made some Batman movies.) Which perhaps makes J. Robert Oppenheimer, the so-called father of the atomic bomb, a perfect subject for Nolan’s first venture into fact-based character drama. (Opening on July 21.) Oppenheimer, as described in the film (which Nolan adapted from the Pulitzer-winning biography American Prometheus), was plagued by visions of a world just beyond our own. He was a pioneer in the nascent field of quantum physics, which meant that, in essence, he really was envisioning another plane of existence: the molecular jumble that makes up all matter, governed by rules and properties we still don’t entirely understand. Oppenheimer and his cohort cracked open human understanding of the universe, a big bang expansion of thought that was, inevitably, almost immediately harnessed for the purposes of destruction. That is the sorry horror at the center of Oppenheimer’s story: that his particular genius, his avid and productive curiosity about the nature of life and its surroundings, could be fashioned into a weapon. Of course, the circumstances of Oppenheimer’s day were dire: The Nazis were working on their own atomic project, and the Allied forces rightfully feared what Hitler and his gang might do with that power if they were to achieve it before the Americans. There is some moral justification for the science, then, if not the implementation of its output. To capture that mood of breakneck progress and impending doom, Nolan works quickly. Oppenheimer is shot and edited at a whizzing clip, scenes darting in and out as we get to know our subject—first as a brilliant but troubled student, then as a respected academic, and finally as the main architect of perhaps the worst invention of all time. The audience is carried along (and later dragged along) as Nolan tears through various university lecture halls and meeting rooms, introducing us to the likes of Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), and other great minds of the age who had varied involvement in this most pressing of arms races. That relentless pace is thrilling and tiring at once. Nolan aptly synthesizes the momentum of these men and their ideas, creating a heady sense of the world suddenly spinning at a precarious new tilt. We are disoriented, yes, but Oppenheimer demands that we trust in the grand mural so furiously painted in Nolan’s stern hues—that it will be understood in its whole once we have caught our breath and taken a step back to gaze upon its magnificence. That bears out, to some extent. At its best, Oppenheimer is a bracing wonder of heavy talk and ticking-clock suspense. As played by Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer is a commanding, eerie figure—haughty and saturnine, haunted and consumed. His political conflicts—a dabbler in Communism and an avowed progressive, Oppenheimer was often regarded suspiciously by military and governmental brass—are nestled convincingly alongside his personal struggles. Oppenheimer’s matters of the heart concern Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), a Communist psychiatrist with whom Oppenheimer had a tortured love affair, and Oppenheimer’s eventual wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), a formidable intellect in her own right—lonely and sozzled but still fiercely invested in her husband’s developing legacy. Interpersonal relationships involving women are not typically Nolan’s forte, but Pugh and Blunt give depth and dimension to characters that might otherwise be flat. Together, they help keep us aware of Oppenheimer the fallible, frustrating man—without them, the film might spin too far into cerebral abstraction. Oppenheimer is, of course, building and building toward the moment when Oppenheimer and his team—an ensemble played by a vast array of young to middle-aged actors; particular standouts are Josh Hartnett, Matt Damon, and Benny Safdie—would test their terrible creation in the lunar deserts of New Mexico. That enormous event does arrive, but perhaps not with the theater-rumbling blare that some might hope for in a summer tentpole movie from the high priest of commercial filmmaking. Oppenheimer is not a film that exists to demonstrate the might of the bomb. It is more of a fraught character piece than perhaps the advertising has suggested, as concerned with what happened to Oppenheimer after the war as it is with what he built during it. The film uses a framing device to hold Oppenheimer’s story in historical context: a security hearing that took place in 1954, when Oppenheimer’s enemies had him stripped of his security clearance, effectively removing him from government for the sin of questioning the advancement of the US nuclear weapons program. In that sense, the film’s chief antagonist is businessman and Atomic Energy Commission chair Lewis Strauss, played with creeping slime by Robert Downey Jr. The last quarter or so of Oppenheimer is devoted almost entirely to these political machinations, turning the movie from a what-hath-I-wrought epic into a twisty backroom thriller more in the Aaron Sorkin vein. It’s a jolt to realize that this has been where the movie was heading all along, as Ludwig Göransson’s omnipresent score swells to match the actors’ interrogative yelling. These were important moments in Oppenheimer’s life, and in the life of the planet. But within the vessel of Nolan’s three-hour film, they play as overly drawn-out denouement. It’s here where I began to lose my grasp on the film’s tangle of names and terms and turns of events. A familiarity with Oppenheimer’s biography would help greatly in making this all legible, but the movie should probably be able to stand on its own. As is, though, Nolan’s film sags under the weight of this complicated exposition. Oppenheimer manages to strike one last compelling pose at its very end, but much of the dreadful majesty is gone by that point, traded for dense Washington conspiracy. Even so, it is admirably bold that Nolan is so determined to make July audiences contend with all this discursive revisiting of the record. Oppenheimer has the temerity to be a drama of ideas staged on a massive scale, at a time when such things are out of vogue. Maybe Oppenheimer will be the force that finally sets off a chain reaction in Hollywood, ushering back in the kind of serious, director-driven studio fare that defined a past industry epoch. Or, it will be but a lone burst of light. No matter its broader effect, Oppenheimer is a mainstream offering of uncommon resonance, sending the viewer out of the theater head-spun and itchy-eyed, ears ringing from all its sophisticated, voluble explosion.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," CLEVELAND, Ohio -- “Oppenheimer” opens with a title card about Prometheus, the titan from Greek mythology who stole fire from the gods, gave it to man and then was chained to a rock for eternity as punishment. For writer-director Christopher Nolan, J. Robert Oppenheimer is the Prometheus of the modern age, a man who helped save the world by giving us the power to destroy it and then was persecuted for it. His biopic is a powerful film that explores the complicated legacy of the man known as the father of the atomic bomb and the thrilling circumstances surrounding the development of the bomb itself. The story begins not at Cambridge where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) studied theoretical physics, but during McCarthyism in the 1950s. Oppenheimer is being interrogated about his supposed ties to the Soviets by a security clearance review board. At the same time, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), head of the Atomic Energy Commission and Eisenhower’s nominee for commerce secretary, would like nothing more than to distance himself from his former colleague at his confirmation hearings. Nolan has perfected his formula of non-linear storytelling and uses it again here to create a shroud of mystery around Oppenheimer’s character and patriotism before slowly peeling back the layers of the enigmatic figure. His first-person account is presented in color while Strauss’ version of the man is shot in black and white. The film then flashes back to introduce a brilliant, but frustrated student who brings the study of quantum mechanics from Europe to the United States at UC Berkeley. There, he socializes with known members of the Communist Party and earns a reputation as a womanizer, an absent father and an arrogant yet charismatic genius who enjoys the spotlight. More significantly, his work as a physicist puts him on the radar of the government as one of the nation’s top minds. When Leslie Groves (Matt Damon, perfectly cast as an impulsive and short-tempered Army officer) taps him to lead the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer, a Jewish man, doesn’t hesitate. He knows the U.S. is in a race with Hitler to build a bomb and, so, he rounds up a team of scientists to develop and test the weapon in a makeshift and secret town in Los Alamos, New Mexico. If anyone can make physics and math exciting and dramatic enough that they deserve to be seen on a giant IMAX screen, it’s Nolan. The scientists experience a series of setbacks, including calculations that suggest the bomb could set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the entire planet, a crisis that draws in Albert Einstein (Tom Conti). The suspense and tension build up to the Trinity Test. The world’s first nuclear explosion is an instantly iconic moment in the film that will make your heart pound and might burst your eardrums. The Los Alamos scenes comprise the most compelling section of the three-hour film. Yet, Nolan spends an inordinate amount of time and interest in rehabbing Oppenheimer’s image vis-à-vis his conflict with Strauss, a petulant and spiteful former shoe salesman turned politician who floats the idea that Oppenheimer might be a Russian spy. Downey is terrific in the role, so it’s easy to see why the director included so much of him. But his sole purpose as an unsympathetic antagonist is to prop up Oppenheimer, reminding the audience that his political loyalties never wavered, and his view on nuclear weapons evolved in his later years. Strauss helps us understand Oppenheimer and the paranoia of that era better but, eventually, it all starts to sound like a broken record. The third act consequently borders on exhausting. Still, Murphy is absolutely captivating throughout the film. He and Nolan do a masterful job of taking the audience inside Oppenheimer’s mind. A scene where he recalls his affair with a younger woman named Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh, always interesting) to the review board is tragic and disturbing. There’s also a morbid and devastating moment where he pictures the victims of Hiroshima in the audience of his speech celebrating the successful dropping of the first bomb. And in an awkward and emotional meeting with President Truman, Oppenheimer laments the guilt he feels for his role in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, saying “I feel I have blood on my hands”. Indeed, the film’s strength lies in its star-studded cast, which includes Josh Hartnett, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Casey Affleck, Alden Ehrenreich and Gary Oldman, among others. The standout is Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty. Her performance is luminous, a firecracker in an otherwise melancholy film who bluntly demands her husband to pull himself together following the death of a loved one, sends him off to the bomb test with a hearty, slightly sarcastic “break a leg!” and plainly tells special counsel Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) exactly where he and his questions can go and what to do when they get there. Nolan has described J. Robert Oppenheimer as the most important person who ever lived, a man who changed the course of history for better or worse. No matter if you believe that or not, it’s hard to argue no one is more suited to make a film about him than the king of the cerebral blockbuster himself. Nolan, once again, delivers, with an epic and immersive film that pulls you in with stunning, larger-than-life visuals, theater-shaking sound and Ludwig Göransson’s sweeping score. “Oppenheimer” is a deeply moving and incredibly haunting story of a complex man who convinced himself repeatedly to sacrifice his own decency for what he believed to be the greater good. His story is the ultimate cautionary tale if not for the chilling reality that we can no longer put the genie he unleashed back in the bottle.

"Jul 19, 2023","  Few filmmakers have had the rapid, impressive rise to success that Christopher Nolan has had over the last 25 years. Out the gate, Nolan has been ambitious, making twisty, unique films like his debut Following and his breakthrough Memento despite extremely small budgets. Within a decade of making his first film, he would revitalize action movies, origin stories, and superhero films with both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight—still widely considered the greatest superhero film of all time. In his first dozen films, Nolan has taken us deep inside the mind (Inception), to the darkest reaches of space (Interstellar), and explored war in a way we’ve never seen before (Dunkirk). While his experiments haven’t always been entirely successful, like with his last film, 2020’s Tenet, it’s hard not to admire Nolan’s attempts to push the boundaries of what film and storytelling can do on such a large scale.   Nolan’s twelfth film, Oppenheimer, feels like the culmination of everything the director has done so far in his already remarkable career. From the multiple timelines of Memento and Dunkirk, and the staggering abstract footage in Interstellar, to his ability to build tension and anticipation through stunning scores and impeccable editing, Nolan uses all of the talents and techniques that have made him such a noteworthy auteur to bring to life the extraordinary accomplishments, pains, and life of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy). In bringing this expansive and gargantuan true story to the screen, Nolan has created not just one of his best films, but easily the most mature film of his career.   In telling the story of Oppenheimer, Nolan returns to a technique he used in Memento, by showing one man’s experience through varying timelines. Like that film, one timeline is told in color, while the other uses black-and-white photography. In the color timeline, Oppenheimer explores his past through his perspective via a hearing where he must run down his years running The Manhattan Project and the creation of the first atomic bomb, his communist ties, and his affairs, all while the people from throughout his life come to testify about his actions. In the black-and-white segments, Nolan follows Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), as he discusses his involvement with Oppenheimer over the years, all during Strauss’ questioning to secure the nomination for Secretary of Commerce. Through these dueling timelines, each showing important moments from different perspectives, Oppenheimer peels back multiple layers of Oppenheimer, a man who did unbelievable things, and then feared the potential of what his research could eventually bring.   Murphy, who has been a supporting player in five of Nolan’s previous films, finally gets the starring role here and the result is incredible. Oppenheimer is shown as a relatively quiet man, and despite that, Murphy allows us to see every moment of trepidation, every moment of fear for what his ideas could eventually mean, and every glimmer of joy at some new revelation, all through tiny mannerisms and the worry in his eyes. Murphy is beautifully restrained here, and even though his actions are world-changing, we can feel the implications of Oppenheimer’s achievements simply through a look in Murphy’s eyes, or the way he hesitates in a sentence. After years of working with Nolan, Murphy's take on Oppenheimer will go down as one of the best performances ever captured by Nolan’s camera.   While it might sound like hyperbole, Nolan has gathered one of the most unbelievable casts in modern film, a flabbergasting amount of talent that puts actors like Oscar-winners Rami Malek, Gary Oldman, and Kenneth Branagh in small supporting roles, but gives actors like Murphy who might often be put in more minor roles into greater positions. While there are too many exceptional performances to point out, it’s excellent to see actors like Alden Ehrenreich, Benny Safdie, and David Krumholtz get major positions in this film, and it’s wonderful to see Josh Hartnett and Jason Clarke in substantial roles. Even though there are plenty of great actors in blink-and-you-miss parts, Nolan does all he can to give as many of these performers at least one scene that will stick with the audience long after the movie is over.   But it’s Downey Jr. who makes the biggest impression of the entire cast, other than Murphy’s Oppenheimer. While Oppenheimer mostly wears his feelings on his sleeve, Downey Jr.’s Lewis Strauss keeps his secrets close to his chest, making him an absorbing counter to the title character. His more subjective take on Oppenheimer’s life and career gives us a perspective we rarely see in films about real-life personalities, and Downey Jr. gives one of his best performances as well, and it’s wonderful to see him explore this type of role after years in the MCU pipeline.   Also noteworthy is Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, who puts Oppenheimer in his position at The Manhattan Project. The relationship between Oppenheimer and Groves is one of the most complex in the film, and it’s fascinating to watch how it shifts over the years. Plus, if you’re making a film about an impossible goal that needs to be met in a shocking amount of time (Ford v. Ferrari, The Martian, Air), there’s no better person to call than Damon.   Alas, Nolan still has problems with substantial female roles, and that does continue in Oppenheimer. Like many of the male scientists, the apparently lone female scientist—played by Olivia Thirlby—doesn’t get as much screen time as she deserves. Similarly, the women in Oppenheimer’s life certainly should’ve received more attention, however, that doesn’t stop Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, and Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer’s on-again-off-again partner Jean Tatlock from making the most of their time onscreen. Pugh only gets a few scenes, but her impact resonates with Oppenheimer long after his last scene. Blunt’s role is far more substantive, as we see her beg Oppenheimer to fight back as he’s raked over the coals by his own government. It’s hard not to relate to her utter rage at his treatment, and her frustrations over her position in life show sides to Blunt that we’ve never seen before from her.   But beyond this embarrassment of riches that is this cast, it’s Nolan that truly makes Oppenheimer a gargantuan achievement, and how he’s able to find just the right people to work with—both in front of and behind the camera—to make this phenomenal vision come to life in all its glory. This all, naturally, begins with Nolan’s script, based on the book “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. In bringing this 700+ page book to the screen, Nolan has crafted an incredibly dense script that never manages to feel too convoluted or overwhelming—a feat in itself, considering how many timelines and characters are thrown into the mix. It’s almost akin to what Tony Kushner had to cram into Lincoln by adapting Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals.” There is so much life and story to be told here, and the fact that Nolan can navigate all of this succinctly and without getting in over his head is astounding.   Behind the camera, again, Nolan is returning to some of his old techniques and talents, but in a way that feels more refined and careful than ever before. He knows he can impress—he’s done that before—but now, he knows how to utilize these skills in a way that puts story first, not as a way to awe the audience. All of these tools come together to the point that it almost feels as if Nolan’s entire career has been building to this film. Oppenheimer allows Nolan to be bombastic, but never over-the-top in a manner that distracts from the narrative. The performances and Oppenheimer’s troubled story is more important than the technical achievements Nolan creates, and while he has frequently felt like he’s the true star of his own films, he knows how to stand aside here to let the story take precedence over bombast.   This, of course, doesn’t happen without an incredible team behind him, and Nolan has gathered remarkable support in telling this story. Hoyte van Hoytema, who Nolan has worked with since 2014’s Interstellar, knows exactly how to beautifully shoot every scenario Nolan throws at him, whether it’s New Mexico at dusk, two lovers having a conversation in a dark hotel room, or the explosion of bombs and stars in shocking fashion. Every frame is breathtaking, and just when you think you’ve seen all the tricks Nolan and van Hoytema have up their sleeves, they shock with another. The way the two build the tension leading up to the dropping of the first bomb is astonishing, but just as monumental is the way the camera shakes around Oppenheimer when the repercussions of his research become too much for him to handle, almost as if the world around him could come crashing down, as that could both literally and figuratively be happening at any moment.   Oppenheimer’s ever-present score by Ludwig Göransson accompanies nearly every moment of the film, knowing exactly when to pull back, or when to provoke the audience with the sounds of a ticking clock or static underneath the onslaught of an orchestra fully enveloping the viewer in sound. Nolan and van Hoytema’s visuals are always impressive, but it’s Göransson’s score that takes Oppenheimer to another level, and continues to prove that he’s one of the most exciting composers working in film today.   But Oppenheimer’s success since this summer has also been a welcome change for the box office landscape. As franchise films have waned in their popularity over the course of this year, it’s been exciting to see a film like Oppenheimer (currently the fifth highest-grossing film at the domestic box office in 2023), which relies on great filmmaking and excellent performances to gather a crowd. While Marvel and DC films have failed to meet expectations, Nolan has shown that all an audience really wants is to be told a fascinating story that they’ve never seen before on the screen, and hopefully, studios in the future will learn the right lessons from Oppenheimer’s success.   Oppenheimer is a towering achievement not just for Nolan, but for everyone involved. It is the kind of film that makes you appreciative of every aspect of filmmaking, blowing you away with how it all comes together in such a fitting fashion. Even though Nolan is honing in on talents that have brought him to where he is today, this film takes this to a whole new level of which we've never seen him before. With Oppenheimer, Nolan is more mature as a filmmaker than ever before, and it feels like we may just now be beginning to see what incredible work he’s truly capable of making.

"Jul 19, 2023"," As a young academic, J. Robert Oppenheimer witnessed the early days of the field known as quantum mechanics. This was more than a new science, one of Oppenheimer’s associates claims, but a “new way to understand reality.” One can imagine Christopher Nolan’s ears perking up when he heard that phrase. As a director, he is particularly focused on movies that present new ways to understand reality; to break apart and contemplate the rigid rules of time and space, to contemplate the nature of human consciousness and subconscious. Nolan’s subject in Oppenheimer is a bit more straightforward than some of his more fanciful thrillers — it’s a biopic about its title character, the scientist and academic widely regarded as the father of the atomic bomb — but its structure is as twisty and complex as any Nolan has ever devised. It cuts between several different timelines (some in color and others in black and white) to chronicle Oppenheimer’s rise and fall from public life. At some points, Oppenheimer nimbly bounces between four different but connected temporalities simultaneously, each one reflecting different aspects of Oppenheimer’s story. At three hours long with dozens of speaking roles, it’s got to be the weightiest and most ambitious $100 million movie a studio has released in the middle of the summer in many years. At the center of it all — the nucleus around which all of this epic tale’s particles orbit — is Cillian Murphy, giving a transformative performance brimming with intelligence and barely contained emotion. (He also looks and sounds nothing like the man we’ve come to know from films like 28 Days Later, Sunshine, Red Eye, and Nolan’s own Batman Begins.) A curious intellectual with liberal political leanings and a distaste for dogmatic thinking, Oppenheimer associated with (and in some cases did a whole lot more than associate with) Communists in his early years, something that will become enormously important when the U.S. government recognizes the need to build an atomic bomb before the Nazis can, and the military man in charge of the project (Matt Damon) identifies Oppenheimer as the most qualified candidate to lead such an effort. Damon’s General Groves pushes through Oppenheimer’s appointment and security clearance, and Oppenheimer in turn brings together some of the best scientific minds of the 20th century to build what his team refers to as “the gadget.” The effort (spoiler alert) is successful, and Oppenheimer’s role in the Manhattan Project makes him one of the most famous men in the world. But in the years after World War II, Oppenheimer’s past puts him at odds with the Eisenhower administration and the Red Scare. When his security clearance comes up for renewal, the Atomic Energy Commission convenes a hearing that appears to exist solely to discredit and embarrass him for his political affiliations. Nolan’s script, which he based on the award-winning biography American Prometheus by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, arrays these hearing sequences atop of and in between Oppenheimer’s work at Los Alamos — and then adds an additional timeline set several years after the hearings, during the Senate confirmation for a colleague of Oppenheimer’s, Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), which threatens to expose even more secrets about Oppenheimer. Past and present collide more frequently in Oppenheimer than in Nolan’s Tenet, which was a film about a technology that actually allowed humanity to invert entropy. That’s a choice that is jarring at first, but its purpose gradually becomes clear along with Oppenheimer’s larger themes about how carefully considered actions often spark unforeseen and uncontrollable consequences — like the ripples in a puddle of water that Oppenheimer observes in the film’s very first scene. The tricky structure also helps Nolan keep Oppenheimer from becoming a more traditional (read: boring) biopic. By laying this man’s triumphs and tragedies side by side, he also shows they were inextricably linked — again, underscoring the movie’s ideas about chain reactions. Murphy’s Oppenheimer occasionally discusses the theoretical possibility of what we now know as black holes. Before his time at Los Alamos, he wrote a paper on the existence of “dark stars” that contain so much gravity that not even light can escape it — and thus we cannot see them with the naked eye. But the stars in Oppenheimer are plainly visible, and right up until the very end of the movie, they keep popping up in scene after scene. Some, like Dane DeHaan, play small but important supporting roles (in his case, that of a military man working on the Manhattan Project who later became an important figure in the government’s moves to discredit Oppenheimer). Other huge-name talents appear in cameos so small that they cannot even be characterized as glorified. (Gary Oldman drawls Harry S. Truman’s words of thanks on behalf of a grateful nation to Oppenheimer during a tense visit to the Oval Office.) These familiar faces — Alex Wolff! Tony Goldwyn! Benny Safdie! David Dastmalchian! Matthew Modine! David Krumholtz! Alden Ehrenreich! Jason Clarke! Josh Hartnett! Kenneth Branagh! Jack Quaid! James Urbaniak! — make Oppenheimer the single most impressive assemblage of “that guy” screen acting talent of the 21st century. But they also serve a practical purpose. Oppenheimer’s career and various post-Manhattan Project scandals contain so many important players that it becomes all but impossible (at least for a layperson like yours truly) to remember of everyone’s names and historical roles. Being able to recognize the actors in those roles helps to keep the basics of the drama clear. Sometimes Nolan’s poetic visual flourishes conflict with these characters’ expository tendencies. There are a lot of speeches in Oppenheimer about patriotism and loyalty and morality; some of them work, while others feel a little redundant when they are presented in context with Nolan’s complex editing scheme and striking images. (The movie’s final thesis is pretty obvious well before Oppenheimer himself spells it out in the last scene.) American Prometheus was over 700 pages long; in that sense, we might actually consider the three-hour Oppenheimer a work of remarkable brevity. Even at three hours, though, there are a few people in this story who deserved more attention, most crucially Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer’s wife Kitty, who had a fascinating life before she even met him at a dinner party. Oppenheimer’s complex relationship with Kitty — and their shared relationship with a fiery and emotionally troubled Communist played by Florence Pugh — loom large in Oppenheimer’s mind, yet take up very little of the actual runtime. Those quibbles aside, Oppenheimer is intelligent non-IP-driven filmmaking on a scale we simply don’t see in movie theaters anymore — especially not in mid-July. At this time of year, we’re so used to movies filled with explosions we become numb to them. Oppenheimer really only contains one bomb — one whose fate we know right from the start — but it’s astonishing how much drama that one blast generates, because Nolan so clearly shows what it meant, not only to Oppenheimer, but to the entire world. Everything about Oppenheimer recalls the title character’s description of light to a classroom of students. Light, he explains, can be understood as both a wave and a particle.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The wartime Soviet intelligence services had a codename for the Manhattan Project, the US’s plan to build an atom bomb: Enormoz. Christopher Nolan’s new film about it is absolutely Enormoz, maybe his most enormoz so far: a gigantic, post-detonation study, a PTSD narrative procedure filling the giant screen with a million agonised fragments that are the shattered dreams and memories of the project’s haunted, complex driving force, J Robert Oppenheimer, a brilliant physicist with the temperament of an artist who gave humanity the means of its own destruction. This is the big bang, and no one could have made it bigger or more overwhelming than Nolan. He does this without simply turning it into an action stunt – although this movie, for all its audacity and ambition, never quite solves the problem of its own obtuseness: filling the drama at such length with the torment of genius-functionary Oppenheimer at the expense of showing the Japanese experience and the people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Nolan moves back and forth in time, either side of the historic 1945 firebreak, giving us Oppenheimer’s beginnings as a young scientist, lonely and unhappy, electrified by the new developments in quantum mechanics, the young leftist who never became a Communist party member but whose anti-fascism galvanised his desire to develop the bomb before the Nazis could, directing the work of hundreds of scientists. Later in the 50s, there is the disillusioned, compromised administrator, hounded by the McCarthyites for his communist connections, nauseated by his own pointless celebrity, by his failure to establish postwar international atomic control and by a single denied thought: the Nazis surrendered long before there was any suggestion they had the weapon, and bombing the defeated Japanese at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was merely to cow the Russians with a ruthless demonstration of the US’s nuclear mastery. Cillian Murphy is an eerily close lookalike for Oppenheimer with his trademark hat and pipe, and is very good at capturing his sense of solitude and emotional imprisonment, giving us the Oppenheimer million-yard stare, eyeballs set in a gaunt skull, seeing and foreseeing things he cannot process. Matt Damon is the boorish Lt Gen Leslie Groves, Oppenheimer’s exasperated military minder; Kenneth Branagh is his genial scientific hero and mentor Niels Bohr; Robert Downey Jr is the duplicitous Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss; Florence Pugh plays his lover Jean Tatlock, whose heart he broke, while Emily Blunt is his wife, Kitty, also badly treated. Tom Conti plays the sorrowfully detached Albert Einstein, and it has to be said that Nolan, rightly or wrongly, uses non-Jewish actors for Oppenheimer and Einstein, two of the most famous Jewish people in history and in fact doesn’t quite get to grips with the antisemitism that Oppenheimer faced as an assimilated secular American Jew. There is a horribly gripping scene showing Oppenheimer’s formative experience as an unhappy graduate student in England at Christ’s College, Cambridge. He suffered what amounted to a psychotic breakdown and left a poisoned apple on the desk of his testy supervisor Patrick Blackett (James D’Arcy), which Blackett fortunately didn’t notice and didn’t eat. Nolan coolly invites to see this as a parable for the lost Eden of a more innocent prewar physics, with Oppenheimer as a serpent with Adam’s foolish innocence. And of course there is the creeping biographical irony: how terribly close Oppenheimer came to … killing someone. The purest payload of fear is delivered in a scene that Nolan handles with forthright gusto. After the successful detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, Murphy shows us Oppenheimer in shock, but also realising he has to address an audience of cheering colleagues and subordinates. He knows it is his duty as a leader to congratulate them and be upbeat, stammering out some fatuous remark about how the Japanese “didn’t like it”, then realising how callous that was, and beginning to hallucinate the horror. Of course, Oppenheimer did not witness the actual use of his weapon, he never saw anything becoming death, the destroyer of worlds, and Nolan takes the decision to look away from it too, to stay in the US, to stay with Oppenheimer himself in all his sudden tragic irrelevance. Perhaps the film’s most important moment is the one that addresses its own flaw: the legendary postwar encounter in the White House Oval Office between Oppenheimer and President Harry S Truman (played by Gary Oldman), the man who took the final executive decision to drop the bomb. Nolan and Murphy show how Oppenheimer shrinks and cringes into the couch in front of him, like a scared little boy, apparently wanting something like absolution from the president and mumbling that he feels he has “blood on his hands”. Angry and baffled, Truman tells him curtly that all this is his responsibility as president and asks a very pertinent question: does Oppenheimer think the Japanese care who made the bomb? No, they want to know who dropped it. It’s true: concentrating on Oppenheimer is simultaneously fascinating and beside the larger historical point. In the end, Nolan shows us how the US’s governing class couldn’t forgive Oppenheimer for making them lords of the universe, couldn’t tolerate being in the debt of this liberal intellectual. Oppenheimer is poignantly lost in the kaleidoscopic mass of broken glimpses: the sacrificial hero-fetish of the American century.  This article was amended on 20 July 2023 to give Lt Gen Leslie Groves his more commonly used name. An earlier version referred to him as Lt Gen Richard Groves. His full name is Leslie Richard Groves.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Until now, the most prominent image of J. Robert Oppenheimer came from a 1965 interview with NBC, in which he recalls his thoughts in the immediate aftermath of the first ever detonation of a nuclear device. “Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” he says, quoting the Bhagavad Gita. Between the physicist's haunted expression and the fact that it consumes nearly the entire frame, the clip is the initial particle collision leading to the nuclear chain reaction of Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer. A three-hour biopic that plays like a jolting thriller, Oppenheimer seldom slows down except to ruminate on questions of all-consuming guilt, as it imagines a vivid psychology lurking within its protagonist’s conscious mind, plagued by doomsday visions that serve as both warning and indictment for humankind. It’s paralyzing, pulse-pounding, breathtaking. The opening scenes set expectations for the kind of movie that follows, establishing its three-pronged framing device and flashing back to introduce the future father of the atomic bomb (played at all ages by Cillian Murphy) during his college days in the 1920s, when he was particularly lonely and disturbed. The first time we see Robert, gaze aimed downward as in the NBC clip, he stares at droplets of rain rippling in puddles, a calming image that reminds him of hellfire bursting forth from subatomic particles. Even the serenity of nature can’t soothe his troubled mind. These intrusive thoughts recur throughout the film, especially in moments when he’s forced to confront the awesome might of his creation. The way Terrence Malick contrasts his coming-of-age story in The Tree of Life with images of celestial bodies, Nolan’s tale of hubris, regret, and power unleashed is frequently interrupted by images conceived on a subatomic scale, refracted and blown up to the size of an enormous 70mm IMAX screen, as if to put into terrifying context just how much destruction can be wrought from something so infinitesimally small. It’s Nolan’s Tree of Death. Two governmental hearings draw us into Robert’s past, both several years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One, presented in washed out color, challenges Robert’s loyalty to the United States in 1954, while another, shown in black and white, puts former Atomic Energy Commission Chair Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) – a former ally and eventual adversary of Robert’s – in the hot seat in 1959. The latter often harkens back to the former, which itself traces Robert’s scientific career through the 1920s and ’30s until his eventual recruitment to the Manhattan Project in 1942. It would be easy to compare this structure to that of The Social Network, another depiction of consequential real-world events that weaves a single story from a pair of depositions. But the dueling hearings in Oppenheimer create clashing perspectives that occasionally result in overlapping and repeated scenes, each from the points of view of Robert and Strauss respectively, with one revealed in (slightly more vivid) color, and the other in monochrome. The duo’s relationship isn’t the story’s central driving force – that would be the race to build and test the atomic bomb, which takes up a significant chunk of the runtime – but it serves a vital thematic purpose. Oppenheimer delves into both men’s egos in a manner that eventually builds to a stunning dramatic conclusion that fully unearths the persistent undercurrent of regret stirred by Nolan and draws a layered and explosive performance out of Downey like no other film of the past 20 years. Until that conclusion, the story unfolds as if in free fall, bolting purposefully between numerous scenes in which vital scientific breakthroughs occur, bringing Robert and his merry band of handpicked scientists one step closer to the power of the gods. Plenty of wrenches are thrown in their gears, often thanks to probing questions posed by their own suspicious, Red-Scare’d government, courtesy of some well-cast security officials – Dane DeHaan, Casey Affleck and David Dastmalchian play administrative bastards of the highest order – a hurdle which enhances the existing intensity. As the enigmatic Robert – a professor orbited by excited students like electrons around a nucleus – Murphy brings a requisite sense of poise and command that contrasts his gaunt stature. But he wears a perpetually distraught expression that can be deciphered even behind his put-upon smiles. He doesn’t look “like he’s seen a ghost,” so much as he looks like he’s been seeing them all his life, forcing one to wonder whether his ability to envision the building blocks of existence propelled him to greatness, or cursed him for all eternity. Given the story’s structure, Oppenheimer unfolds like a memory tinged with regret – but was it fated? Murphy’s face seems to constantly ask this question too. The highlights of the star-studded supporting ensemble are, for once, the women in Nolan’s cast, a pair of female characters whose involvement with America’s Communist Party (and Robert’s association with them) draws the ire of Uncle Sam. Florence Pugh plays Jean Tatlock, a volatile romantic presence in Robert’s life, and the center of a surprisingly imaginative and unsettling sex scene, while Emily Blunt plays Kitty, Robert’s long-suffering spouse. She’s significantly more well-rounded than the standard-issue supportive wives of Hollywood biopics, who do little else than sing the praises of their partners’ genius. Instead, Kitty is perhaps the only person who knows the true Robert inside out: the man behind the martyr, skillfully disguised behind his faux humility and a grating “lonely genius” persona. J. Robert Oppenheimer is a paradox only she can solve, and it weighs on her constantly. Much of Murphy’s screen time is spent opposite either David Krumholtz as Robert’s warm and witty friend Isidor Isaac Rabi, or Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, a military engineer placed in charge of The Manhattan Project’s security. It’s yet another role that speaks to Damon’s commitment to being an anti-movie star, his character’s frustrations with Robert and his desperation to be heard (often unsuccessfully, given the caliber of intellect that surrounds him) taking center stage in humorous ways. A who’s who of 20th century scientists veers in and out of the story’s purview – it’s the Avengers of physicists: Feynman, Bohr, Neddermeyer, Einstein, Heisenberg – but ultimately, the focus remains on Robert’s journey through cognitive compartmentalization, as he self-justifies building the very thing he has always feared. Nolan, who adapted the screenplay from the biography American Prometheus, performs numerous filmmaking feats alongside his Tenet collaborators, from cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, to composer Ludwig Göransson, to editor Jennifer Lame. The gigantic IMAX frame, nearly as tall as it is wide, is used to tremendous effect, not only to capture spectacle, but to push in dramatically to close-ups, and to portray sweeping New Mexico landscapes in which Robert is positioned as history’s tiniest, loneliest man. Göransson, meanwhile, crafts propulsive and unnerving music out of atmospheric sounds, like the stomping feet of a riled-up crowd, which steadily builds in tempo. Working in tandem with sound designer Randy Torres, Nolan and Göransson know exactly when to forego the otherwise thundering effects and let silence take full control. Even whispers of human breath – in both relief and abject horror – become their own symphony when Robert’s mind becomes most fixated on catastrophe shortly after the Trinity test. Here the filmmaking reaches its razor-wire zenith, wrapping the character in his deepest fears and anxieties by making them horrifyingly real. It’s arguably the best-directed scene Nolan has ever committed to film. You’ll know it when it happens. Lame draws us in and out of these living nightmares through intimate sensations of sound and touch, as if the world were suddenly so volatile that the slightest bit of stimuli might set it ablaze. Even the bomb itself is so weathered and textured as to feel alive, a slumbering beast waiting to be awoken. Watching Oppenheimer in 2023, we know the world doesn’t end in 1945 – but it always feels like it could, at any moment. That adrenaline and its stomach-churning aftertaste never wear off. The fear of death and destruction continues to radiate as if through the screen itself, making Oppenheimer as much about the future as it is about the past. Nolan maintains this momentum through not only scenes of wartime innovation, but more contained sequences too, presenting a sterile, claustrophobic security hearing in the most breakneck cinematic form. (Bureaucracy has never seemed so terrifying.) At its core, the movie always circles back to the question of J. Robert Oppenheimer’s place in history, as seen by others, and by himself. The conclusions it comes to are far from easy, depending more on the movie’s frequent, awe-inspiring abstractions than its words. It’s an earth-shaking cinematic vision unlike anything else in Nolan’s filmography, the kind of film whose aesthetic impact might just leave you shuffling out of the theater in silent reflection – a sensation few modern Hollywood directors are capable of instilling. A biopic in constant free fall, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s most abstract yet most exacting work, with themes of guilt writ large through apocalyptic IMAX nightmares that grow both more enormous and more intimate as time ticks on. A disturbing, mesmerizing vision of what humanity is capable of bringing upon itself, both through its innovation, and through its capacity to justify any atrocity.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Cillian Murphy stars as the “Father of the Atomic Bomb” in a stacked ensemble that includes Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr. and Florence Pugh. 
	But there’s a method to Nolan’s approach, which becomes increasingly apparent as the two separate Washington hearings laced throughout the narrative intersect in the foreground and occupy the riveting final hour. And the emotionally affecting decision to close with an earlier private conversation between Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) elegantly brings it all back to the personal views of two men looking at their branch of science from different perspectives. 
	Nolan expertly builds his dramatic crescendo by exposing the pain and humiliation of that hearing for Oppenheimer and his flinty wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), and then reopening those wounds five years later, during the Eisenhower administration’s Senate confirmation hearings for the nomination of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) as secretary of commerce. 
	In a mighty ensemble of heavy hitters, Downey gives the drama’s standout performance as Strauss, a founding member, and later chair, of the Atomic Energy Commission, whose political ambitions get tangled in his vindictiveness toward the arrogant Oppenheimer. 
	The actor makes him mild-mannered at first, playing up Strauss’ origins as a humble shoe salesman. The ruthlessness with which he pursues his goals is displayed only toward the end, when the stakes are at their highest, spilling out in a bitter torrent of rage. It’s a stunning moment of revelation and a reminder of skills that many of our best actors have put aside while they frolic around playing quippy superheroes for huge wads of cash. 
	As the central figure in this erudite saga of men and science, warfare and Washington opportunism, Murphy builds a fine-grained character portrait, making the soft-spoken Oppenheimer’s complexities no less evident for being a man of such outward restraint. 
	The actor’s piercing pale blue eyes are a window to the physicist’s lofty intellect, his dogged determination and, eventually, to his torment as he comes to acknowledge his naivety and face the ramifications of what he has set in motion. Rather than startle the world into playing nice, as he had ingenuously imagined, the Japanese bombings merely opened a door to the Cold War, and to the escalating threat of more powerful nuclear bombs — one that resonates louder than ever today. 
	Coverage of Oppenheimer’s early years feels somewhat cursory and his encounters with like-minded scientists initially tend to blur, though his studies at prestigious colleges in Europe — in addition to facilitating encounters with some of the field’s most influential figures — serve to show that his skills lay in theoretical physics, not lab work. But little by little, distinct personalities emerge. 
	Subtle notes of humor also come from the man that recruits Oppenheimer, Major Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), who oversees the secret research and development project and provides the liaison between the government and the scientists. A gruff career military man probably better suited to the battlefield than to War Department jobs, Groves has a stern manner but an underlying respect for Oppenheimer’s genius, a duality that Damon plays to moving effect in the 1954 hearing. 
	Blunt’s role at first seems limited to the supportive wife, urging her husband to fight harder for his reputation. But she has a knockout scene in the same hearing, disavowing her premarital affiliation to the American Communist Party without apologizing for it. 
	Kitty also shows her emotional resilience when confronted with her husband’s troubled romantic attachment to psychiatrist Jean Tatlock, a role brought to sensual but tortured life by Florence Pugh. Jean’s strong ties to Communism contribute to suspicions about Oppenheimer’s leftist leanings, as do those of his younger brother and fellow physicist, Frank (Dylan Arnold). 
	Aiding immeasurably in Nolan’s unfaltering control of tone and tension is Jennifer Lame’s nimble editing and especially Ludwig Göransson’s extraordinarily forceful, almost wall-to-wall score. The music combines with the bone-shaking sound design to give the movie a febrile energy that won’t quit, mirroring the nervous inner life of its title character. 
	The director deftly cranks up the suspense in the nail-biting countdown to the Trinity test, when even the sharpest minds haven’t ruled out the “near zero” chance of a chain reaction destroying the world; and even more so as each of the two hearings (shot in black and white) reaches its climax. The choice not to show the Japanese bombings, but to experience them exclusively via radio reports and through the jubilant reaction of the Los Alamos community — an entire township built expressly for the Manhattan Project — heightens the gut-punch impact, while images flashing through Oppenheimer’s mind only hint at the horror unleashed. 
	It’s hard to know how the Nolan fanboys will respond to a movie as heady, historically curious and grounded in gravitas as Oppenheimer, which has little in common with the brooding majesty of his Batman movies or the tricky mindfuckery of films like Inception or Tenet. In terms of its stirring solemnity, it’s perhaps closest to Dunkirk, while its melding of science and emotion recalls Interstellar. 
	This is a big, ballsy, serious-minded cinematic event of a type now virtually extinct from the studios. It fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," This piece was written during the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes. Without the labor of the writers and actors currently on strike, the movie being reviewed here wouldn't exist. ""Oppenheimer"" introduces its protagonist in crisis mode. He's studying abroad and terribly homesick, unable to sleep, and mocked by his teacher. That mockery leads the young scientist to do the unthinkable: poison the apple sitting on the teacher's desk. It's a risky way to introduce your main character, and Nolan is immediately signaling Oppenheimer's fractured mental state — he's brilliant but tormented, as if he's constantly trying to solve some problem in his overactive mind. From here, Nolan is off to the races, jumping in and out of two distinct timelines. The main timeline, shot in color, is told entirely from Oppenheimer's point of view, giving us the story as he saw it (or as Nolan, adapting the book ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird Martin J. Sherwin, imagined he saw it).  The second timeline, filmed in black and white, zeroes in on another character: Lewis Strauss, the former U.S. Atomic Energy Commission chairman, as he undergoes a cabinet post hearing in the 1950s. Played by Robert Downey Jr., Strauss is our window into a different view of Oppenheimer; an outsider looking in. Downey Jr., who has been too busy with Marvel stuff to appear in many other movies (except ""Dolittle""), is electric in the part, trading in his usual mannerisms for a more reserved, mysterious character. We can't quite crack what Strauss is about and why the film is focusing on him so much, and that's because Nolan is playing the long game. He'll get there eventually.  After the splitting of the atom in 1932, Oppenheimer is one of the first to realize the possibility of using this advance to create a bomb. As it turns out, the Germans have the same idea and are apparently working on a bomb of their own. When America decides to build an atomic bomb, Oppenheimer badly wants on the team. But there's a problem — Oppenheimer is a leftist and an alleged Communist (he claims he never officially joined the party, but attended meetings). That's a big no-no for the U.S. Government, even before the red scare. Enter General Leslie Groves (a fiery, funny Matt Damon), a no-nonsense military man who is willing to overlook Oppenheimer's leanings in order to make him the leader of the entire project.  All of this unfolds quickly, with Nolan cutting around and crafting fast little montages to show the passage of time. Ludwig Göransson's constant, propulsive, scary soundtrack booms and moans under it all, while Nolan adds abstract sounds that we can only understand later — a constant motif of what sounds like a roaring train turns out to actually be the stomping of feet from an audience right before Oppenheimer gives a big speech.  Oppenheimer assembles a team and the building of the bomb begins. The film keeps this almost playful at first, especially as it introduces one new character after another, almost all of whom are played by recognizable faces. But as the deadline increases, the tension builds. By the time Nolan gets to the testing of the bomb, I found myself on edge, bouncing my leg and biting my thumbnail as the tension builds, and builds, and builds, until the only release can be an explosion of haunting, terrifying, obliterating beauty.  Building the bomb is only one part of the movie. ""Oppenheimer"" also tells another story — the story of a man willing to allow himself to be pilloried. Like Jake LaMotta in ""Raging Bull,"" Oppenheimer is stepping into a ring of sorts and allowing himself to be pummeled. Why? Because he thinks he deserves it. The aftermath of the bomb begins to horrify him, altering his perception and leading to his voicing his concerns about the future of weapons. This raises the eyebrows of the U.S. Government, and Oppenheimer finds himself under attack. His wife Katherine (a sadly underused Emily Blunt) urges her husband to push back, but he doesn't. He seemingly can't. Who is Robert Oppenheimer? Nolan isn't interested in painting the man as a simple sinner or saint. The two timelines instead result in a far more complex, almost impenetrable character. We can root for him while also being resentful of some of his actions. Again: this is risky, but Nolan and Murphy make it work like gangbusters. Nolan's writing is good here, but it's Murphy's delicate, dedicated performance that really sells it all. He says a million words with only a glance. When he looks out at the world, his huge eyes seem sad, lonely, and also fixed on something we can't quite see. It's also telling that Nolan opens the film with a bit of text on screen about the story of Prometheus: Prometheus stole fire from the gods, and for his actions, he was chained to a rock for eternity. Shot huge in IMAX, ""Oppenheimer"" feels massive. And yet it's also an intimate affair, full of scene after scene of men sitting in quiet rooms having loud conversations. We feel like flies on the wall, eavesdropping on history, waiting to see how the predestined situation plays out. We have an idea of where all of this is going, but we're captivated all the same, enamored with Nolan's narrative and Hoyte van Hoytema's frequently jaw-dropping cinematography — the bomb test scene is an all-timer, shot like a downright biblical event. ""Oppenheimer"" is a huge, thrilling, scary experience. There are touches of lightness — it's not all misery, I promise. But what makes the movie sing is the way it drops a ton of information on us in such a succinct, exciting way. We hang on every word; we marvel at every shot. It's not just a movie, it's a spectacle. A film that asks tough questions and then dares to not give us any easy answers. Like Oppenheimer himself, it's a conflicting movie with an unknowable core. It's also one of the best movies of the year.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," LOS ANGELES, July 19 (UPI) -- Oppenheimer, in theaters Friday, shows writer-director Christopher Nolan in firm command of his filmmaking tools. While the attempt to humanize the creator of the atomic bomb is valiant, technical prowess alone proves insufficient. As a student, Oppenheimer struggled with lab work. At Berkeley, Oppenheimer's interest in politics, from attending communist meetings to organizing a laboratory workers' union, hindered his career advancement. The film presents Oppenheimer as a Jew witnessing World War II and searching for hope wherever he could find it. He wasn't sure the American military was the sole avenue, so he explored other options. The structure of the parallel stories of the Manhattan Project and the post-war hearings is clear. The flashback reveals the answers to questions asked at the hearing, and events surrounding the Manhattan Project inform the hearing proceedings. Where the style is far less effective, it browbeats the audience into submission with little substance behind it. Ludwig Göransson wrote a good score, but the constant use of it is exhausting. Oppenheimer is just barreling through historical events with an oppressive score. Nolan doesn't need to play music while Oppenheimer is just engaging in dialogue in a classroom. Just let some scenes breathe. Nolan may have taken criticisms about his films' inaudible dialogue to heart and strove to keep dialogue at least as audible as the music. There are still a few unintelligible lines, such as when Oppenheimer's wife, Kitty (Emily Blunt), drowns out her own dialogue fumbling with her purse. There is a race against time to complete a bomb before the Germans do. That is effective, even though history tells viewers the United States won that race. The political discussions of which cities to target, and the philosophical rationalizations for doing so, are also compelling. The film wants to be bigger than history, science and philosophy, though, and that is its undoing. Oppenheimer is hurling out themes of Oppenheimer's guilt and the government's desire to paint him as a traitor now that he's served his use. Viewers who know little about Oppenheimer may expect the hearing to pay off as more of a conspiracy than it does. Talk of spies at Los Alamos sounds scandalous, but as history still played out without compromising American intelligence, it feels like an extraneous subplot. The stakes of the hearing ultimately prove to be very low, as these are the hearings that determined the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. His most notable achievement still stands and the rest is a bureaucratic matter. Oppenheimer has facts on its side, but there's no real conspiracy. The resolution of the hearing also devolves into lots of guys in suits talking really fast at each other, but their dialogue does not have the flair of Aaron Sorkin. Despite attempts to include three significant female characters in a male-dominated story, all three women fair poorly enough to suggest it might have been less glaring to stick to the military story. Kitty only gets to be a spurned wife and harried mother for the first half of the film. She becomes pivotal in the film's third hour, which only suggests there must have been more to her earlier in her marriage. Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is the woman with whom Oppenheimer has an affair, but the film gives Jean no internal life outside of the man with whom she's sleeping. Lilli Hornig (Olivia Thirlby) gets to contribute a few ideas to the project, as she must have in real life, but the film fails to develop her character. Oppenheimer is clearly the movie Nolan set out to make. His choices are so intense that its missteps slightly outweigh the breakthroughs, and a bit more discretion could have balanced the opposing elements.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan's highly anticipated large-format rumination on The Father of the Atomic Bomb, jumps around the timeline of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life throughout its three-hour duration. With this in mind, let's skip directly to ""the scene."" Most people know that the Trinity test of the first nuclear ""gadget"" near New Mexico's Los Alamos Laboratory in 1945 was successful. I certainly knew it, as in prep for the release of Oppenheimer, I tasked myself with reading Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin's dense, 600+ page history American Prometheus, which Nolan used as his principal source for the film. And yet, as the story engine whirred up and the countdown began, I sat in the middle of an IMAX theater and nearly had a panic attack. Just as Oppenheimer and his army of scientists ultimately had to roll the dice and say, ""Well, I hope this works,"" it's fair to say that Nolan — whose best films Memento, The Prestige, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet have all been tightly woven original stories drawn from fantasy or science fiction elements — has successfully pulled off a big bet. This is a movie with no surprises for anyone with access to Wikipedia, and yet, by exploiting the enriched uranium of propulsive editing, intense music, crystalline cinematography and powerhouse performances, it manages to turn what's mostly a bunch of men talking to one another in rooms into the most breathtaking film of the year.  Knowing Nolan's roots as a cinema classicist, the influences are clear. Blue-eyed Cillian Murphy as ""Oppie"" (as he was, indeed, nicknamed) is his spin on Peter O'Toole's T.E. Lawrence. Like Lawrence, Oppenheimer is a grand figure who rose to celebrity in the furnace of war but whose attitudes were mercurial, his actions contradictory, and his behavior was a little too peculiar for mainstream narratives. And like David Lean's Lawrence of Arabia, Nolan's film is a vast, sweeping epic that mesmerizes its audience.  Which is weird because, like I say, a lot of it is just guys in rooms. Sure, the desert sequences (and images from Oppie's student days in Europe) pack their punch, but despite numerous associative cutaways to electrons zipping around quantum fields, this is a movie about men looking stressed in front of blackboards and then, later, wondering if they did the right thing. In a lot of rooms.  And not even nice rooms! Indeed, when Oppenheimer sat before a security hearing in 1954, it was, by design, a bland, nondescript office. The hearing, which essentially kicked him out of public life, was Oppenheimer's punishment for daring to suggest that the U.S. government, in the thrall of the Cold War, should rethink the wisdom of building a nuclear arsenal. He also drew the ire of many for expressing misgivings about developing the vastly stronger hydrogen bomb. Also, perhaps more importantly, there was that time he ridiculed his influential frenemy Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Some performances from the swarm of Los Alamos characters jump out. Benny Safdie's hulking figure works wonders as Edward Teller, who would eventually become Oppenheimer's foe when he developed the hydrogen bomb. David Krumholtz is extraordinary as Isidor Isaac Rabi, the first physicist to raise ethical concerns about developing the Manhattan Project. (He turned down the opportunity to work at Los Alamos, but remained a friend and advisor to Oppie.) Lastly, in one of his best roles in years, there's Matt Damon as Leslie Groves, the military head of Los Alamos and, basically, Oppenheimer's conduit to Washington. Damon sinks his teeth into the brass tacks character, acting, at times, as comic relief. The gravity of the Manhattan Project enters the story slowly. At first, Oppenheimer is just following the physics. Then, he sees his work as preventing a catastrophe of a Nazi first strike. Later, after Germany surrenders and many feel Japan is facing inevitable defeat, the decision to use the bomb anyway is ... complicated. A scene with James Remar as Secretary of War Henry Stimson is nauseating in its bluntness. This story moves from scientific theory to ""Okay, which city shall we destroy?"" rather quickly. The women in the film, however, get the short end of the stick. Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty gets ""one great scene,"" but I can't really say the same for Florence Pugh as Oppie's lover, the psychiatrist and communist Jean Tatlock. (Those hoping that Oppenheimer would yank on the thread of conspiracy that surrounds her death may be disappointed; though sharp viewers might clock one shot that nods in that direction.) Olivia Thirlby reps one of the few women scientists at Los Alamos, Lilli Hornig. She only has two or three lines, but they do stick out.",POSITIVE

That turns out to be very, very close, indeed, and yet also never quite close enough. While “Oppenheimer” invites you to stare at Cillian Murphy’s face in shallow-focus IMAX-sized close-ups for much of its three-hour running time, it seldom offers serious insight as to what’s happening behind his marble-blue eyes, let alone the opportunity to see through them. The result is a movie that’s both singularly propulsive and frustratingly obtuse; an overwritten chamber piece that’s powered by the energy of a super-collider.  Paced like it was designed for interstellar travel, scripted with a degree of density that scientists once thought purely theoretical in nature, and shot with such large-format bombast that repetitive scenes (or at least Nolan-esque slices) of old politicians yelling at each other about expired security clearances hit with the same visceral impact as the 747 explosion in “Tenet,” “Oppenheimer” is nothing if not a biopic as only Christopher Nolan could make one. Indeed, it would seem like the ideal vehicle for Nolan’s career-long exploration into the black holes of the human condition — the last riddles of a terrifyingly understandable world.  Per the director’s signature approach, the film’s relentless narrative swerves between different timelines, aspect ratios, color schemes, and perspectives. In truth, however, the conceit essentially boils down to two clear aesthetics spread across three distinct moments in history.  The first, labeled “Fission” and shot in the closest equivalent this drab-as-death movie has to full color, follows Oppenheimer (Murphy) on a forward path from his days as a rakish autodidact and world-traveling dilettante to his eventual selection as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during the Manhattan Project. Also presented in color, or at least striking a dank compromise between “DMV green” and “middle-management white,” are long and increasingly agitated glimpses into Oppenheimer’s secret 1954 security hearing, in which a clutch of hawkish politicians who resented Oppenheimer’s resistance to the H-bomb program attempted to strip him of his top-secret clearance by playing up his pre-war connections to the Communist Party.  Fission and Fusion. Nolan has never come up with a cleaner way of framing the chemical reaction that galvanizes so many of his films. From “Inception” to “Dunkirk,” Nolan’s symphonic movies don’t hinge on linear cause-and-effect so much as they split themselves into a series of discrete atomic parts that eventually slam into each other with enough excitement to create a hyper-combustible chain reaction, and that’s exactly what happens in “Oppenheimer.” Here, Nolan’s non-chronological approach allows us to experience the bomb and its fallout all at once, thus making discovery inextricable from devastation, creation inextricable from destruction, and the innocent joy of theory inextricable from the unfathomable horror of practice. It’s 1936, and Oppenheimer is introduced to a socially progressive young psychiatrist named Jean Tatlock at a party in Berkeley; they have sex while he reads her the “Bhagavad Gita” in the original Sanskrit (we’ve all done it). Tatlock is played by a flushed-cheeked Florence Pugh, whose “be here now” earthiness adds a necessary edge to one of the Mal-est female characters Nolan’s written in a minute. Emily Blunt has no such luck in the role of Oppenheimer’s alcoholic wife, whose diminishment feels particularly egregious in a movie that hardly bothers to express what Oppenheimer thinks of her, or if he thinks of her at all. It’s the following year, and buttoned-up physicist Ernest Lawrence is pleading with Oppenheimer to keep leftist politics out of the classroom. Lawrence is played by the great Josh Hartnett, whose warm and welcome performance sets the tone for a film in which virtually every bit part has been cast with someone’s favorite actor: Benny Safdie, Josh Peck, Alden Ehrenreich, Jason Clarke, David Krumholtz, Alex Wolff, Dane DeHaan, “Gargoyles” auteur Kenneth Branagh, Macon Blair, Matthew Modine, and Olivia Thirlby are just a small sample of the names printed on what must have been the wildest call sheets in recent memory.  It’s also 1947, and Oppenheimer is accepting a cushy Princeton job from Downey’s Salieri-like Strauss, who seethes at perceived slights from the giants before him as he watches his new hire make smalltalk with Albert Einstein (Tom Conti, just the right amount of silly). This is the rare scene that proves meaningfully enriched by Nolan’s color-coded approach to subjectivity, as Oppenheimer and Strauss turn out to have very different takeaways from the encounter. For the most part, however, the frequent shifting between color and black-and-white serves as a frustrating reminder of how little Nolan gets in return for this gambit. As the director of “Inception” must already know: If you need a glaring signpost to inform the audience they’re in a character’s head, they’re not really in a character’s head. The test itself makes for an incredible setpiece, even if Nolan’s awesome pyrotechnics fail to capture the full horror of a bomb that was designed to be a spectacle of deterrence (the explosion feels unimpeachably realistic, and yet falls short of viscerally reconciling modern audiences to a horror that recent generations have tried to wish away). But the aftermath proves far more searing, as Oppenheimer is forced to relinquish control of his precious “gadget” and sit by the radio like everyone else in order to learn about what happened when it was deployed. It’s Schrödinger’s bomb. For one extraordinary moment in time, the destroyer of worlds is perfectly suspended between theory and execution, as Nolan’s shark-like storytelling slows down long enough for us to imagine the moral calculations that Oppenheimer must have been making in his head, and how weak he must have felt in the aftermath of harnessing such god-like might (contained as it is, few movies have so effectively conveyed the destructive power of ambitious men in small rooms).  Murphy’s performance is every bit as inspired as his casting. He plays Oppenheimer as more of an artist than a physicist — as the rare man of science who God could mistake for a prophet — and the opening passages of Nolan’s film twitch and fulminate in response to that creative temperament. That effect is most palpable in the way that Murphy appears to dance on the bow tip of Ludwig Göransson’s Zimmer-worthy score, which is all mercurial violins and spooky action at a distance before that delicate touch is replaced by the cacophonous layers of sound that every Nolan film relies upon when its parallel storylines converge in the third act. Nolan sympathetically addresses Oppenheimer’s discomfort with being hailed as a hero, and takes great pains to detail his subject’s even greater distress at realizing that he’ll never be able to put the atomic genie back in its bottle. “Who would want to justify their own life?,” someone asks, with the implicit understanding that none of us could. Nolan indicates time and again that Oppenheimer is powerless to understand the full meaning behind his actions (“Genius is no guarantee of wisdom,” one character offers), but the film is deeply afraid of sitting with the weight of that uncertainty.  But it’s no great feat to rekindle our fear over the most abominable weapon ever designed by mankind, nor does that seem to be Nolan’s ultimate intention. Like “The Prestige” or “Interstellar” before it, “Oppenheimer” is a movie about the curse of being an emotional creature in a mathematical world. The difference here isn’t just the unparalleled scale of this movie’s tragedy, but also the unfamiliar sensation that Nolan himself is no less human than his characters.

"Jul 19, 2023"," It may seem a little crazy to think that anyone might be worried about spoilers for Christopher Nolan’s biopic about atom bomb pioneer J. Robert Oppenheimer, as played by Cillian Murphy. Maybe a few people reading this have actually read Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin’s American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy, on which it’s based. Really, it’s more about how Nolan tells the story of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project with a stacked cast of actors and some of the best craftspeople in the industry. (And I will state in advance that I saw the movie a second time in IMAX 70mm before writing this, as there were things that confused and even bored me on first viewing that made WAY more sense a second time around.) Oppenheimer may start like a typical biopic, hitting all the important benchmarks of Dr. Oppenheimer’s career, but bouncing around in time between those moments and some later in Oppenheimer’s career where there are a number of hearings, split between moments in color and others in black and white. (And if you see the movie in full-screen IMAX, you’ll also see that a good portion of the film uses the entire screen.) One of Oppenheimer’s allies seems to be Robert Downey Jr’s Lewis Strauss, who brings him post-WW II to Princeton to run the Institute of Advance Study, and this leads to a relationship that will be the core of the two storytelling threads. If you know anything about Oppenheimer and his story, you may have an advantage, but for me, there were just way too many characters, and the first hour and 45 minutes seemed to be all this talk about science and communism, none of which I could really keep track of, nor would I realize how all of it plays a role and gets tied up in the film’s last hour. Nolan deliberately avoids putting any sorts of dates or timestamps or locations on the film, as it bounces from past to “present” with much of the story being told through the hearings. To some, there may not seem to be rhyme or reason about the use of color or black and white, but it tells you right at the beginning what is going on. There are two stories: 1. Fusion and 2. Fission, and essentially, it’s telling two stories through the viewpoints of Oppenheimer and through Strauss, who is a critical character despite disappearing seemingly for an hour or more.  Oppenheimer’s flaws are never glossed over or candy-coated, and there are times when he doesn’t feel like a particularly likeable human. Nolan never shirks from Oppenheimer’s rep as a womanizer, including his relationships with Communist Jean Tatlock, as portrayed by Florence Pugh, an affair his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt) seems well aware of. It also touches upon the work done by so many Jewish physicists – something mentioned by “Oppie’s” good friend Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz) – as one of the reasons why Hitler never turned to using a bomb as an advantage in the war. After the first hour, we get to the Manhattan Project at the center of Oppenheimer’s story, building the Los Alamos scientific (and military) community, which will spend three years developing the atomic bomb, building up to the fabled “Trinity” test of July 16, 1945, where the first nuclear explosion is tested. That ends up being a critical and major turning point for Oppenheimer as everything we’ve seen before that is painted in a new picture after Oppenheimer is made Man of the Year by Time Magazine. That’s also where we begin to see his relationship with Strauss in a new light, and in that last hour, any trepidation about the slower pacing and talkie nature of the first two hours dissolves.  A lot of the conflict from the last act comes from whether Oppenheimer can get his security clearance renewed due to possible connections to Communism, as he and those who know him are grilled by Jason Clarke’s Roger Robb, with parts reminding me of Aaron Sorkin’s underrated Being the Ricardos.  And then there are the crafts – the undeniably gorgeous score by Ludwig Göransson; the way Hoyte van Hoytema uses his camera to capture character interactions and glorious Los Alamos vistas with equal scope;  Jennifer Lame’s exceptional editing; and the sound, which I believe will be an Oscar frontrunner, if only for the way it’s used for the Trinity test in terms of silence vs. the explosive force of the first A-bomb.  By the time you get to the end of Oppenheimer, you feel as if you’ve experienced something unlike anything else Nolan has done before, but also just a terrific and unique way of telling this story, in a similar way as Dunkirk was Nolan’s unique take on the WWII flick. No, it’s not all giant explosions, at least not the kind made famous by the A-bomb (and no gory graphic footage of Hiroshima/Nagasaki either), but Nolan uses his screenwriting and cast to make the drama just as powerful, and everything gets a callback in a way that makes far more sense later.  Taking bits of A Beautiful Mind and mixing it with dollops of Amadeus and 12 Angry Men, Oppenheimer makes it undeniably clear what a masterful filmmaker Nolan can be when he finds a topic that truly captivates him and is more concerned about telling a story well then making something light and frothy for casual moviegoers. For that, you have Barbie. (I’m kidding.)",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," The three-hour biopic about the so-called father of the atomic bomb is a technical, visual, and storytelling achievement. It’s also the best film of both Nolan’s career and 2023. Christopher Nolan’s cinema is one of dualities: between knowledge and ignorance (Memento); seeing and sightlessness (Insomnia); good and evil (The Dark Knight); illusion and authenticity (The Prestige); dreaming and waking (Inception); courage and cowardice (Dunkirk); and the past and the present (Tenet). In that regard, Oppenheimer—a film of endless contrasts and contradictions—is the fullest expression of the writer/director’s artistry to date. Propelled by the inexorable march of progress and imagination and electrified by the terrible thrill of theories, dreams, and miracles realized in all their devastating glory, it’s a divided epic of awe and horror, fission and fusion. It’s simultaneously a unified portrait of a conflicted man and a singular achievement for Hollywood’s reigning blockbuster auteur. Adapted from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2005 biography American Prometheus, Oppenheimer (July 21, in theaters) begins with images of raindrops falling on a pond’s surface and fiery detonations in the void—the first of innumerable opposing visions that are in unlikely harmony, or at least uneasy coexistence, in Nolan’s masterpiece. An individual of myriad paradoxes, Cillian Murphy’s J. Robert Oppenheimer is a scientist (and the father of theoretical physics in the United States) who adores art and culture; a towering intellectual who’s incompetent in the laboratory; an arrogant leader who’s unwilling to fight; a devoted lover and partner who’s habitually unfaithful; and the architect of modern annihilation who wants to foster global peace. When, early in his academic career, he’s drawn to quantum physics, because it suggests that the impossible—namely, that light is both a wave and a particle—is true, it’s a telling snapshot of his inherent attraction to the irreconcilable. As with so much of Nolan’s prior work, Oppenheimer is chronologically fractured, recounting its tale from two perspectives: that of Oppenheimer, in color, and of Atomic Energy Commission chairman Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), in black-and-white. In accordance with that structure, the film casts its dual strands as flashbacks told by these characters during, respectively, the secret, Red Scare-driven 1954 hearing that cost Oppenheimer his security clearance and the 1959 Senate hearing that denied Strauss the Secretary of Commerce position he coveted. Throughout, Nolan narratively and formally intertwines Oppenheimer's and Strauss’ fates, juxtaposing them in order to highlight the story’s fundamental honesty and duplicity—what with its clandestine military operation in the Los Alamos desert, pervasive paranoia about Soviet spies stealing secrets from the Americans, and marital infidelities. Throughout, the film depicts Oppenheimer as a man partially unaware of himself; Edward Teller (Benny Safdie), his Manhattan Project colleague, tellingly asks him, “Nobody knows what you believe! Do you?” Mysteries of the self and the universe are conjoined in the film, whose early passages find Oppenheimer gazing upwards or out into the darkness amidst cutaways to twinkling stars, shining molecules, and paroxysmal flames. Oppenheimer segues between intimate close-ups of Murphy’s lined, gaunt face and made-for-70mm-IMAX panoramas of cities, mountain ranges, and the cosmos until the two, like every other at-odds element in this drama, feel naturally wedded to one another. Shot with grandeur by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, the film is sensually overwhelming, its titanic visuals matched by Ludwig Göransson’s bellowing score of anxious ticking, thunderous foot-stomping, discordant buzzing, and strident Psycho-esque strings. The last of these is remarkably apt, given that the proceedings are, in a certain sense, a nightmare about the corrosive legacy bequeathed by a parent to their (figurative) progeny. Nolan begins with a flurry of borderline avant-garde cutting between spaces, places, and faces (courtesy of stellar editor Jennifer Lame), and he never lets his foot off the gas. Whether set in Oppenheimer’s Princeton classroom or his beloved New Mexico, every scene is awash in physical and mental movement and progresses at a pace fit for a pulse-pounding thriller. I can recall no biopic ever hurtling forward at such a scorching clip; it shifts among points of literal, conceptual, temporal, and geographic focus at a speed that allows the director to cram an amazing amount of biographical material into his three-hour opus.  At the same time, and particularly with his fiercely loyal wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), the film finds room to also suggest the incidents, dynamics, and struggles taking place beyond the edges of his compositions. Be it Oppenheimer’s impetuous attempt to poison a tutor with a cyanide-laced apple, his volatile romantic relationships, confrontational but respectful partnership with Manhattan Project director Brigadier General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), combative rapport with prosecutor Roger Robb (Jason Clarke), or frustration with Teller—whose interest in fashioning an even more powerful hydrogen bomb he opposed—Oppenheimer is loaded with detail, nuance, incongruity, and ambiguity. There’s an embarrassment of riches to digest, savor, and mull over in this saga, which touches upon the exhilaration of scientific discovery, the fear of inventing something over which the inventor has no control, and the alarming consequences of paving a historic path, especially when it leads directly to Pandora’s Box. At every turn, superb supporting performances are delivered by Damon, Blunt, Kenneth Branagh, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, and Tom Conti as Albert Einstein (who knows how uneasily lies the head that wears the crown). Special mention goes to David Krumholtz as Isidor Isaac Rabi, an Oppenheimer associate whose initial moral qualms about joining the Manhattan Project are eventually shared by Oppenheimer and, in the end, by the film. Oppenheimer draws its figures in vigorous strokes, capturing their hesitancy and certainty, loyalty, and treachery—none better than Strauss, whom a tremendous Downey Jr. transforms into the vilest sort of jealous, vindictive rat. At the center of this maelstrom is Oppenheimer, whom Nolan lionizes to the point of having him don his trademark hat and coat like he was Bruce Wayne putting on his Batsuit. Murphy imbues the scientist with so many warring traits, impulses, and instincts—he’s peerlessly perceptive and blind to his own faults; ambitious and uneasy in the spotlight; self-possessed and ultimately unsure of his choices—that his countenance resonates as a topographical map of his increasingly harried soul. It’s a magnificent marquee turn from the Peaky Blinders star (and frequent Nolan collaborator), providing a micro and macro concept of the physicist’s internal and external battles. No matter if he’s enormous or minuscule in the frame, Oppenheimer as envisioned by Nolan is a pioneer as titanic as the mushroom clouds that his “Little Boy” and “Fat Man” produced. He’s also just as controversial, viewed by his comrades and the public as an exceptional hero, and his McCarthyite detractors and enemies as a left-leaning Communist incapable of being trusted with the nation’s security. Oppenheimer’s socialist sympathies and Judaism are presented as core aspects of his personality and motivation for embarking upon his atom-bomb quest, and the former proves a persistent thorn in his side and results in his (temporary) downfall. His complexity additionally extends to his private life. “I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds,” muses Oppenheimer upon witnessing the Manhattan Project’s maiden “Trinity” test, and yet he first utters that Bhagavad Gita quote in the film when he’s in bed with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh), the mistress whose suicide would be one of many deaths for which he blamed himself. Love and misery, triumph and tragedy, desire and obligation—all are writ small and large by Nolan, with the personal and political colliding in unpredictable, calamitous ways. Intensely attuned to its protagonist’s heart and mind, Oppenheimer wrestles with questions of justness and responsibility regarding the atom bomb’s development and function, and with Oppenheimer’s alternately reasonable, reckless, and misguided decisions. It’s a complex character study-cum-history lesson that recognizes that our greatest accomplishments can also be our doom, violently shaking the world in explosions of dazzling light and cacophonous sound (or eerie silence) that leave behind charred bodies, tattered reputations, unappeasable bitterness, and tormented psyches. It's the creation myth of our contemporary age, begat in eruptions of 10,000-foot-tall pillars of fire that swallow the past and engulf us with dreadful ferocity. “A terrible revelation of divine power” is how Oppenheimer describes his paradigm-shifting weapon of mass destruction, and he might as well be speaking about Oppenheimer itself. This is surely the finest and most inspired film of Nolan’s career, not to mention 2023’s best.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," El Christopher Nolan más político y ambicioso logra convertir la historia de J. Robert Oppenheimer en un sesudo y trepidante relato plagado de preguntas y dilemas morales, con actores y actrices en estado de gracia. Pocos cineastas cuentan con la influencia de Christopher Nolan. Para llevar algo más de una decena de películas, el londinense ha sido capaz de dejar huella en el cine de ciencia ficción, en el de superhéroes, en el histórico. Precisamente a este último regresa con 'Oppenheimer', su ambicioso repaso a la figura del físico teórico considerado ""padre"" de la bomba atómica, y a todo lo que ocurrió después. Y como siempre con el cine de Nolan, no estamos ante un biopic o una película histórica cualquiera. Estamos ante algo más. La ambición de Nolan se desata a pleno rendimiento en esta película de tres horas centrada en J. Robert Oppenheimer. La base es 'Prometeo Americano', libro escrito por Martin J. Sherwin y Kai Bird, ganador del Pulitzer. El relato no se queda solo en el Proyecto Manhattan, sino que continúa con el ""no juicio"" al que sometieron al científico tiempo después, argumentando revisar sus credenciales de seguridad, con el claro ánimo de desprestigiarlo. Era la época de Guerra Fría, de caza de brujas, del Macartismo, de persecución de las ideas comunistas.El guion de Christopher Nolan no sigue una secuencia lineal de los hechos, sino que va dando saltos desde los años de estudiante de Oppenheimer hasta este escrutinio, hilando temas y construyendo dilemas morales. La película, como todas las del cineasta, no pretende ser una simple recreación, sino que quiere que demos vueltas a muchos asuntos durante y sobre todo después de verla.Nolan se moja más que nunca en este guion en el que habla de las consecuencias de la carrera armamentística, tanto militares y humanitarias como científicas, del comunismo como enemigo indeterminado, del sindicalismo enfrentado al capitalismo más americano, del peso de la inteligencia y del precio del ego. Su película nos plantea preguntas difíciles con toda la pretensión que siempre le ha caracterizado, pero sale tremendamente airoso gracias a hacernos partícipes de primera mano y lo más cerca posible de uno de los acontecimientos más importantes de la historia moderna.Porque ahí sigue estando la clave del éxito del cine de Nolan. 'Oppenheimer' es una película histórica y política de manual, que se apoya enormemente en (muchos) diálogos casi calcados a lo que ocurrió de verdad, pero también tiene disparada la espectacularidad. Pocas cintas biográficas cuentan con una escala como esta, en la que cada escenario se siente real y en el que brilla cada aspecto del diseño de producción, desde el vestuario hasta el atrezo.También consigue que aguante bien el ritmo, y hablamos de una película de tres horas. Jennifer Lame, encargada del montaje, apuesta por acelerar con cortes ágiles y frenéticos hasta en las conversaciones más anodinas. La edición evoluciona con el tono de la película, que no se estanca más allá de un par de momentos valle. Lo que comienza como algo parecido a 'Una mente maravillosa', se deja de lo convencional y pasa a una contrarreloj con el desarrollo del Proyecto Manhattan que llega a dejar al borde de la butaca a pesar de que sepamos, obviamente, lo que va a pasar. El juicio a Oppenheimer nos ahoga en una atmósfera claustrofóbica y el cierre de la película golpea de tal forma que quizás son necesarios unos minutos antes de empezar el debate postpelícula.Quiero destacar todo el uso del sonido. La espectacular banda sonora de Ludwig Göransson se complementa con una gestión magnífica del ruido y, sobre todo, del silencio, para remover las emociones y convertir ciertas escenas en los momentos más impresionantes de la película. El apartado visual, como era de esperar, es cuidadísimo, empezando por la maravillosa fotografía de Hoyte van Hoytema al uso del IMAX para crear planos generales inmersivos y primeros planos profundamente íntimos.Cómo usa el blanco y negro para separarnos del punto de vista de Oppenheimer, cómo realmente se siente ""práctica"" la recreación de la bomba... Puede que Nolan maneje presupuestos desmesurados, pero sabe muy bien cómo hacer que se note cada céntimo en pantalla. 'Oppenheimer' es un biopic caro que se siente fabulosamente caro.A sus espaldasCillian Murphy también merece un estruendoso aplauso por cargarse una película como esta a sus espaldas. El director recompensa la fidelidad del actor irlandés dándole un caramelito de personaje que Murphy estruja para sacarle todo el jugo. ""Oppie"" no es el tópico de científico introvertido e incómodo, aunque un poco también. Es un intelectual, un bon vivant y un mujeriego. Cillian Murphy construye esa personalidad compleja y sabe jugar muy bien con la escala de grises, igual que el guion, para que las cartas no estén dadas la vuelta a pesar de haber apostado por un punto de vista tan cercano. Está de Oscar, y no es el único.Alrededor de Murphy encontramos un espectáculo reparto con nombres enormes, como Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. o Florence Pugh. Todos ellos saben que su lugar es apoyar al protagonista, le dejan brillar y le dan contrapartes potentes sin querer robarle la escena. Y aún así Nolan sabe cómo darles a prácticamente todos algún momento para lucirse. Blunt y Pugh, que tienen el papelón de tener los únicos personajes femeninos protagonistas de toda la película, los defienden con garra, con dos mujeres que podrían tener su propia película.Pero es Robert Downey Jr. el que aprovecha para volver a demostrar que es uno de los mejores actores de su generación gracias a este críptico y pasional Lewis Strauss, un antagonista a la altura y una de sus mejores interpretaciones en mucho tiempo.'Oppenheimer' es una película difícil, pero totalmente estimulante. La soberbia de Christopher Nolan vuelve a jugar a su favor para darnos una película sesuda pero épica, política, valiente, terrorífica pero inspiradora, fiel a la realidad pero no constreñida, clásica pero auroral, larga pero trepidante. Qué pocos cineastas hay que sean capaces de hacer tanto con la historia de un hombre. Pero Oppenheimer no fue un hombre cualquiera, y Nolan tampoco lo es.'Oppenheimer' se estrena en cines el jueves 20 de julio.9Lo mejor: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr. y Emily Blunt, de Oscar. El uso del sonido y la música. El diseño de producción y fotografía. Los dilemas que plantea.Lo peor: La duración se nota bastante en un par de momentos, aunque luego sepa remontar.

Puede que Nolan maneje presupuestos desmesurados, pero sabe muy bien cómo hacer que se note cada céntimo en pantalla. 'Oppenheimer' es un biopic caro que se siente fabulosamente caro. Cillian Murphy también merece un estruendoso aplauso por cargarse una película como esta a sus espaldas. El director recompensa la fidelidad del actor irlandés dándole un caramelito de personaje que Murphy estruja para sacarle todo el jugo. ""Oppie"" no es el tópico de científico introvertido e incómodo, aunque un poco también. Es un intelectual, un bon vivant y un mujeriego. Cillian Murphy construye esa personalidad compleja y sabe jugar muy bien con la escala de grises, igual que el guion, para que las cartas no estén dadas la vuelta a pesar de haber apostado por un punto de vista tan cercano. Está de Oscar, y no es el único. Alrededor de Murphy encontramos un espectáculo reparto con nombres enormes, como Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey Jr. o Florence Pugh. Todos ellos saben que su lugar es apoyar al protagonista, le dejan brillar y le dan contrapartes potentes sin querer robarle la escena. Y aún así Nolan sabe cómo darles a prácticamente todos algún momento para lucirse. Blunt y Pugh, que tienen el papelón de tener los únicos personajes femeninos protagonistas de toda la película, los defienden con garra, con dos mujeres que podrían tener su propia película. Pero es Robert Downey Jr. el que aprovecha para volver a demostrar que es uno de los mejores actores de su generación gracias a este críptico y pasional Lewis Strauss, un antagonista a la altura y una de sus mejores interpretaciones en mucho tiempo. 'Oppenheimer' es una película difícil, pero totalmente estimulante. La soberbia de Christopher Nolan vuelve a jugar a su favor para darnos una película sesuda pero épica, política, valiente, terrorífica pero inspiradora, fiel a la realidad pero no constreñida, clásica pero auroral, larga pero trepidante. Qué pocos cineastas hay que sean capaces de hacer tanto con la historia de un hombre. Pero Oppenheimer no fue un hombre cualquiera, y Nolan tampoco lo es.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," In terms of who can relate, perhaps it’s only Atlas that could know as much as J. Robert Oppenheimer about what it’s like to have the weight of the world on one’s shoulders. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is an epic biopic but not in the traditional sense. Much like how his Dunkirk functioned more as a suspense film than a war movie, this story focusing on the “father of the atomic bomb” has far more going for it as a character-based thriller than a retelling of the events surrounding the Manhattan Project. True to form for the director, in delivering such an ambitious project, the choices to utilize IMAX cameras, an ensemble cast, innovative filmmaking techniques, and more have resulted in a blockbuster experience with plenty on its mind. Adapted by Nolan from Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, “American Prometheus,” the film focuses on the life of Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), a theoretical physicist. This includes his earlier years, where he worked as a professor at Berkeley and shared interests with many leftists and members of the American Communist Party. The bulk of the film, of course, follows his tenure as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during WWII. Cutting into all of this is what transpired during a notable security hearing in 1954 that explored Oppenheimer’s leanings, actions, and associations. While plenty can be said about the build-up that led to the creation of the atomic bomb, the film’s structure, which incorporates the hearing, allows a degree of focus to emerge, along with a centering around what Nolan is trying to get at. For all the details shown that reveal the kind of person Oppenheimer was, let alone the craft on display to recreate major historical events, the film can still be boiled down to a “men in a room” thriller emphasizing the nature of the bureaucratic process, the failings of a political system, and the importance of science and what brilliant minds have to offer, as complicated as these people can be. For a film set during a pivotal point in world history, it’s unsurprising to see how relevant it all still feels. From the outset, Nolan makes the viewer aware of his intentions with the narrative by color-coding the film. Scenes featuring color put Oppenheimer’s perspective of events on display. Now, it would be easy to say the scenes shot in black-and-white (using IMAX-sized black-and-white photographic film created for this movie) put the facts on display, but it’s actually more inventive than that. And even with an understanding that the history already took place, so there’s nothing to spoil, the way this film manages to lean into why the black-and-white sections are essential ties to the journey we find these characters on. Either way, as interesting as it is to see Nolan constructing a narrative that feels more in line with Memento or The Prestige, his ability to deliver as a maximalist is fully on display. Cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema once again shows just how aligned he is with the director’s vision, as the efforts to show the vast areas of New Mexico are matched well with the far more constrictive rooms we see characters in, yet it’s all so engrossing. With a heavy emphasis on getting shots in camera, for all the work involved in bringing Los Alamos back to life (leading up to a practical recreation of the Trinity nuclear test), showing the effect filming in IMAX can have on intense close-ups in small spaces affords Nolan the chance to really get a lot out of the performers. Given this talented ensemble cast, seeing such great work here is no surprise. As the titular character, Murphy, in a rare chance to serve as the lead, is truly excellent in this film. With no need to go back to a childhood flashback or provide too many belabored details about his upbringing, etc., Murphy conveys so much of the kind of person Oppenheimer is through subtle changes in expression, sections where he’s allowed to add charm into his analytical way of speaking, and line readings that register as conflicted, the more he’s pushed to define certain stances. It’s a wonderfully calculated performance. Support from Matt Damon is as good as one expects. As Leslie Groves, the man who assigned Oppenheimer to the Manhattan Project, Damon projects as needed as a stern general who understands who he’s dealing with. Emily Blunt also offers fine support as Kitty Oppenheimer. For a film very much settled into its time and place (meaning almost exclusively white and male), Blunt takes the traits known about this wife character and does enough to make her presence and usefulness to the story being told understood. Nearly every working character actor is also featured in this film, including Uncut Gems director Benny Safdie as Hungarian physicist Edward Teller, Josh Hartnett as nuclear physicist and Nobel Prize winner Ernest Lawrence, and many others. With that in mind, it’s Robert Downey Jr. who also deserves high praise. Coming into this film as if he’s washed off the sheen of headlining a massive franchise for over a decade and is ready to get dirty again, his work as Lewis Strauss is terrific. Rather than leaning into the idea of being the smartest man in the room who gets by on smarmy charm, Downey upends what has typified his career resurgence and aims for something more vulnerable, no matter what kind of face he puts on to hide it. Glad to see the actor tapping back in with something so nuanced. At three hours, there’s a lot of movie here. The large cast can be explained by the lack of shortcuts Nolan takes by not featuring any composite characters. For all the effort put into showing the mind of Oppenheimer on the largest canvas possible, so much of this film is rooted in actual history that it’s hard not to admire something so sweeping in the same way one looks at films like The Right Stuff. That said, the notion of pushing in all the elements of a thriller speaks to the pacing of this film. Oppenheimer initially takes its time, but so much of the construction of this story relies on short scenes, allowing the audience to feel as though they are constantly on the move. Once it settles into deliberations concerning Oppenheimer’s activities, the added stress (and how that’s visualized) only ratchets up the intensity further as the atmosphere adjusts appropriately. I suppose for a blockbuster film about the birth of the Atomic Age, one may expect intense discussions concerning the moral implications surrounding the use of an a-bomb, as opposed to lengthy debates detailing political alliances. That is a factor in this film and an important one. Multiple scenes featuring Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein (Tom Conti) do plenty to speak to this point. In a wise move, Nolan also appreciates how to layer in what a reserved figure like Oppenheimer would have to say and how he would react to such a quandary. As a result, how this film decides how to grapple with the responsibilities of being an architect of destruction allows one to leave with intriguing questions to ponder. Oppenheimer is the result of a filmmaker who continues to find ways in which he can dare the audience to go along with his unique approaches to familiar territory. It would be one thing to deliver a straight-ahead take on the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, yet here we are with a narrative that crosscuts an incredibly dangerous gamble with science with an intense study of what it takes to unravel one of the most significant developments in American history. Equipped with a stellar cast and terrific work from Nolan’s team, including composer Ludwig Göransson’s, who delivers a wonderful score, this film reaches exceptional heights when it fires on all cylinders. Made to be watched on the most enormous screen possible, Nolan has gone out of his way to show that, as Oppie said, “Science is not everything, but science is very beautiful.”",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023",Oppenheimer is Nolan&#8217;s magnum opus&#46; It is his strongest&#44; most cohesive script&#46; The way he picks apart his subject with such brutal and purposeful intent is masterful&#46;  It is a triumphant masterpiece&#46; Nolan&apos;s most profound and career-defining film to date&#46;,POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Christopher Nolan returns to the silver screen with his first feature film since 2020’s Tenet with Oppenheimer. The biographical drama carries over the filmmaker’s monumental scope, but he brings a more grounded approach to his real-life subject this time around. This is where Nolan’s historical film shines. Oppenheimer tells the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), whose theoretical brilliance attracted the attention of his peers around the world. Nolan’s non-linear screenplay leaps between various moments in time to tell the story of how Oppenheimer was recruited to lead the mission to develop a bomb to put an end to World War II and the personal fallout from creating a weapon that changed the world forever. Oppenheimer sits at the center of a crowded narrative packed with a large cast of supporting characters. He works with fellow bright minds to make the atomic bomb a possibility within a short timeframe, but he’s also forced to enter the world of politics to handle logistics as the face of what the bomb represents for the future. These two contrasting worlds tug him in two opposite directions that possess entirely different intentions. Nolan consistently emphasizes the horrors of the atomic bomb and the tension in building it on schedule. However, the most significant moments come with the story’s occasional switch to a more casual nature, as characters speak so little of human life while making their decision of which Japanese city they should target with their potentially world-ending technology. The film doesn’t show the horrifying casualties first-hand, yet its impact is still deeply felt. Kitty (Emily Blunt) and Jean (Florence Pugh) are a couple of the only women with a profound impact on the titular character, ultimately shaping his future. However, they’re drastically underwritten, existing purely as plot devices for Oppenheimer’s emotional turning points. The film also glosses over his respective romances with each of them, providing little investment in these characters. Oppenheimer booms when it digs into the psychological drama of the story, navigating how the atomic bomb affected its survivors, as well as the creators. Oppenheimer must face the consequences of his actions, scrambling to find a way to cope with the blood on his hands in the present and future. Nolan brings some of his signature thriller elements along for the ride, but there’s no denying that the personal stakes are where the film hits its stride. Unfortunately, it doesn’t remain there for long enough to give the film’s emotional weight much room to breathe. Murphy has a lengthy filmography packed with strong performances, but he’s absolutely outstanding as Oppenheimer. He plays the role with such precision, typically acting with his eyes to express the character’s crises. Meanwhile, Blunt elevates the role of Kitty, acting as an utter standout every time she’s on the screen. The supporting cast overflows with recognizable talent in small parts, but there’s no questioning that Murphy and Blunt are the superstars here, with the likes of Downey, Matt Damon, Jason Clarke, and Benny Safdie not far behind. Nolan crafts a technically-absorbing film that only further immerses its audience in its hyped IMAX 70mm presentation. He switches between breathtaking establishing shots in landscapes and closeups that communicate the film’s scale on both micro and macro levels.  Ludwig Göransson’s score is a consistent presence throughout Oppenheimer, surging through nearly every scene. However, its range from wonder to complete horror flawlessly captures the mood Nolan is going for. The impressive sound design plays with silence and bombastic sound in unique ways, all while doing a better job of capturing audibly-coherent dialogue than some of Nolan’s previous films. Oppenheimer is a striking, yet overlong drama that ultimately delivers on a magnificent ending with a significant payoff. It’s a biopic that is less of a character study than it is a historical analysis of pride, self-pity, and consequences with a perspective on humanity’s unquenchable hunger for power that hits home in contemporary times. It’s a good Nolan film that falls short of greatness.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," When you think of Christopher Nolan, you don’t think of activism or character studies. With Oppenheimer, he’s putting forth an epic version of both. In crafting a biopic of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the nuclear bomb, Nolan has opted to make this a tale of not just one of the 20th century’s most important men, but a missive that nuclear warfare will eventually doom us all, much like the weapon’s development ultimately doomed the man himself. It’s as much a thriller as a drama, albeit with the filmmaker’s typical flair. If he was ever going to do his JFK, this is it. It’s also a riveting experience and one of the best things I’ve seen all year.  Oppenheimer is an epic character study as well as a dire warning. This engrossing experience builds to an endgame that places no less than the fate of humanity almost at death’s door. It’s heady stuff for summer cinema, but in Nolan’s hands, the urgency is never ignored, but the riveting nature of it makes for one of is most unique works to date. Frankly, given the choice between more work like this and more explorations of the action genre, I’ll take ten more Oppenheimer types before he goes back to Tenet. We’ve seen him master action. Now, he’s mastered the biopic and character study. This is the story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) and his central role in the development of the atomic bomb. The first act introduces us to the narrative threads we’ll be following. In one, he’s at the start of his career, plagued by visions and seen as a promising but mediocre student. His travels to Europe to meet some of the great scientific minds of his time set him on a course to bring theoretical physics to the United States. In the next thread, he’s a professor at Berkley, recruited by soon to be General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) to become the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, shepherding the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic bomb. The other thread sees him in the aftermath, butting heads with politician Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.), which would eventually lead to the hearing that had his high level security clearance revoked, a black eye for him and more or less the end of his career. As we follow these threads, we see tons of his colleagues throughout the years, as well as several historical figures of note. Even more importantly, we meet the two most important women in his life. There’s the troubled Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) who he wooed early on in his career and would have an affair with, as well as his wife Kitty Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt), who wouldn’t idly stand by while her husband played the role of historical martyr. The third act also sees Strauss’ congressional confirmation hearing intertwined with Oppenheimer’s security clearance hearing. There, Nolan does his best JFK homage, making this a bit of a paranoid thriller, too, one that packs a wallop.  This cast turns in the finest ensemble work in any Nolan film to date. At the center of it is Cillian Murphy, in nearly every scene and spectacular. The haunted nature of his performance is a crowning achievement for his career. Nolan entrusts him with the weight of this enormous role and the end result pays major dividends. Also excellent is Robert Downey Jr., shedding the Tony Stark performance once and for all. It’s a powerful turn that could easily win him the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor if all goes right for him this season. It’s stunning work. Florence Pugh makes an impact in a smaller yet crucial and emotionally/physically naked part, while Matt Damon is rock solid. The other real notable major turn is by Emily Blunt, who comes up big towards the end with a sequence that features the best work of her career. The rest of the epic supporting cast includes Casey Affleck, Michael Angarano, Macon Blair, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, Tom Conti, James D’Arcy, David Dastmalchian, Dane DeHaan, Christopher Denham, Alden Ehrenreich, Tony Goldwyn, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Rami Malek, Matthew Modine, Gary Oldman, Josh Peck, Jack Quaid, Benny Safdie, Matthias Schweighöfer, Olivia Thirlby, Alex Wolff, and more. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan is not just at the height of his storytelling powers, but at his angriest and most activated. Along with his returning collaborators in cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema and composer Ludwig Göransson, this is a technical marvel. Van Hoytema shoots the hell out of the movie, while Göransson’s score may well win him another Oscar (to say nothing of Nolan’s chance to take home the statue for directing as well). Nolan gives his actors a ton to work with, putting forth a script that’s his talkiest to date. At the same time, he directs this with a massive amount of urgency. In telling the story of how developing the atomic bomb not just destroyed a complicated yet good man, but could quite likely bring about the destruction of everything, Nolan is activated. His passion shines through, even if this has some colder and clinical elements. At the same time, this is among his most emotional works, both in front of and behind the camera. Oscars are potentially coming for this flick. At the minimum, a ton of nominations are likely in the card for Oppenheimer. Best Picture, Best Director (for Nolan), Best Actor (for Murphy), Best Supporting Actor (for Downey Jr.), Best Supporting Actress (for Blunt), and Best Adapted Screenplay (also for Nolan) highlight the potential above the line forces on display. Below the line, Best Production Design, Best Cinematography (for Van Hoytema), Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Original Score (for Göransson), and Best Visual Effects could add to the totals. This film could easily be an Academy Award juggernaut if the season goes a certain way. Oppenheimer is an often stunning achievement by Nolan and company. Pairing this with Barbie (reviewed here) might be tonal whiplash, but having seen both films, Barbenheimer is a cinematic treat. Watching Nolan at the height of his powers, alongside this cast, is a treat. Gird yourself for a depressing yet urgent message, as only this storyteller can. The movie is spectacular, even if you won’t leave it with a smile on your face.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," En este mundo en crisis, azotado por tantos conflictos políticos, Oppenheimer de Christopher Nolan es un arrollador recordatorio de la fragilidad en la que vivimos y el control total que los gobiernos ejercen sobre nuestro destino. Es más que un filme biográfico sobre el padre de la bomba atómica: es también un denso thriller épico histórico sobre ciencia, moralidad y destrucción que no está interesado en emocionar, sino en estudiar las maquinaciones políticas y juegos de poder que nos han acercado a una catástrofe nuclear. Fiel a su estilo y alejado de cualquier linealidad, Nolan explora la historia de J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) a través de tres líneas de tiempo frenéticamente intercaladas, casi a manera de una matrioshka. El grueso del filme trata sobre la vida y carrera del físico, desde sus estudios en Europa hasta su dirección del Laboratorio Los Álamos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial; pero Nolan va y viene entre dichos acontecimientos y una auditoría en 1954 durante la cual Oppenheimer fue investigado como espía comunista. Estas secciones son a todo color y representan la experiencia subjetiva del protagonista, mientras que la tercera línea del tiempo, filmada en blanco y negro, nos muestra una investigación de la ya mencionada auditoría en relación al político Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Christoher Nolan ama el concepto del tiempo y aquí lo manifiesta en distintos niveles. Además del ya mencionado juego entre líneas temporales relacionadas a la vida de Oppenheimer, existe un sentido de urgencia que persigue a nuestro protagonista y sus compañeros científicos, pues su trabajo en el Proyecto Manhattan es una carrera armamentista contra los nazis.  Lo anterior es reflejado de excelente manera por los aspectos técnicos de la película. La edición de Jennifer Lame (Tenet) no te deja respirar, pues va de un acontecimiento a otro, como imitando la prisa de los científicos por ganar la guerra. Asimismo, Ludwig Göransson (Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) crea un score que representa musicalmente una cuenta regresiva: es frío, tenso y, cuando llega el momento de aumentar la intensidad, es absolutamente sobrecogedor (en particular en sala IMAX); Göransson es clave en la inmersión a los conflictos personales e históricos que ocurren en pantalla. Es tan asombroso como perturbador el hecho de que los temas de la película y las preocupaciones de Oppenheimer siguen siendo vigentes. Así como recientemente dependimos de avances científicos para volver a sentir seguridad tras la cuarentena y poder vencer al COVID-19, también es cierto que un ataque nuclear podría cambiar radicalmente el destino del planeta. Estamos ante la merced de la ciencia. Oppenheimer juega con estas ideas filosóficas de manera fascinante, pues tenemos a un grupo de personajes 100% apasionados que quieren ver el fruto de sus esfuerzos científicos pero que también le temen a las consecuencias de los mismos. Si estás ayudando a tu país y avanzando en la ciencia, ¿es moralmente correcto crear un arma de destrucción masiva? Oppenheimer quiere acabar con la guerra pero paulatinamente se da cuenta de que su trabajo podría ocasionar el fin del mundo y que, a pesar de ser el maestro de la orquesta, en realidad no es más que un títere sometido a las órdenes y deseos de un poder político más grande. Todo esto le añade un grado de moralidad cada vez más grande a sus acciones. Cuando la noticia llega de que Alemania se rindió y los japoneses están muy debilitados, la complejidad moral incrementa exponencialmente y con ello la emoción de un logro científico se convierte en miedo y luego en remordimiento.  Y es después de la noticia de que Hiroshima y Nagasaki han sido bombardeadas que Christopher Nolan nos regala una de las secuencias más memorables de su filmografía entera, una en donde utiliza al terror para crear una magistral yuxtaposición narrativa del acontecimiento histórico. Vemos la ignorancia del patriotismo celebratorio contra un creador finalmente comprendiendo las escalofriantes consecuencias de sus actos. El uso del sonido es particularmente estremecedor como herramienta para representar el conflicto interno de Oppenheimer. Tal vez la secuencia de la explosión sea la más publicitada, pero es aquí en donde el boleto de sala IMAX en verdad se paga solo. Cillian Murphy (Inception) despliega la frialdad inherente de una historia así, pero también una combinación de la arrogancia propia de un científico genio y la fragilidad, cada vez mayor, de un ser humano que ha puesto en jaque al mundo entero. Un espectacular elenco lo acompaña y aunque por momentos distrae ver tal desfile de estrellas, la calidad es tal que rápidamente te sumerges de nuevo en la historia. Gary Oldman (Mank) y Rami Malek (Sin tiempo para morir) son fenomenales con escasos minutos en pantalla, mientras que un excelente Matt Damon (Air) vuelve a demostrar, por segunda vez en el año, su magnetismo en pantalla, esta vez como un teniente y director del Proyecto Manhattan. Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) nos da una actuación sólida pero Alden Ehrenreich (Han Solo) se lo come entero cada vez que comparten cuadro. Como Albert Einstein, Tom Conti también dejará su marca en ti: su aparición en el tercer acto te pone la piel chinita. Una crítica constante al cine de Nolan es su pobre exploración de personajes femeninos y aunque Oppenheimer es una mejora considerable en este aspecto, no deja de ser una gran debilidad del filme. Florence Pugh (El prodigio) y Emily Blunt (Jungle Cruise) interpretan a los intereses románticos del protagonista, sin embargo, a pesar de su soberbio trabajo actoral, el manejo de sus personajes es apresurado y deficiente. Además de este fallo, el ritmo de la película es, por momentos, demasiado denso y algunos diálogos no son del todo convincentes. Hace unas semanas Sam Altman, CEO de OpenAI (creadores de ChatGPT), lideró un comunicado en el cual advierte que la Inteligencia Artificial plantea un “riesgo de extinción humana”. Tenemos a un hombre que después de desatar una invención potencialmente peligrosa en el mundo, busca mitigar las consecuencias del mismo. Tal vez fue hasta que tuvo los datos duros frente a él que logró comprender la magnitud de la amenaza; ahora pide apoyo para detener el rápido avance de la IA, pero no se atreve a hacerlo él mismo. Esta noción es la misma que, con ayuda de un gran apartado técnico y actoral, Christopher Nolan desarrolla de manera altamente efectiva en Oppenheimer, una película fría y calculadora, le podríamos llamar científica, sobre un hombre que perdió el control de su invento debido al miedo, un sentimiento que reina a lo largo de los 180 minutos de duración porque es el combustible que motiva, que ciega y que condena. Es una moneda de manipulación con la cual los más poderosos juegan a ser dioses, y nosotros, los mortales, podríamos sufrir las consecuencias.

"Jul 19, 2023"," Following the release of “Tenet” in 2020, it seemed Christopher Nolan had reached his limit in delivering big-screen action spectacle and heady concepts. The film received mixed reviews and was unceremoniously dropped during the pandemic on streaming by Nolan’s past studio home, Warner Bros. Feeling the film deserved a fair theatrical run, Nolan left Warner Bros. after a nearly thirty-year relationship. He decided to bring his historical biopic film “Oppenheimer” to Universal Pictures. The timing was right for Nolan to scale back and return to the character-driven work of some of his earlier films without massive budgets, such as “Memento” and “The Prestige.” To the shock of absolutely no one, not only has Nolan given us his most layered and textured character study to date, but it’s told on the grandest scale possible as only Nolan (along with a studio eager to please him by giving him everything he could want) can deliver. “Oppenheimer” represents a monumental achievement from a filmmaker who has already given us timeless classics like the two films mentioned before, “The Dark Knight Trilogy,” “Inception,” “Interstellar,” and “Dunkirk.” And yet, “Oppenheimer” stands tall above most of them with breathtaking IMAX visuals, a thunderous soundscape, an exquisite score, a haunting story, and arresting performances that will surely be in the awards conversation later this year. Based on the 2005 biography “American Prometheus” by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, “Oppenheimer” tells the story of theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy, seizing the moment in the leading role of a major Hollywood feature film finally) and his development of the atomic bomb in 1945 which not only ended WWII but launched us into the Cold War arms race with Russia and has been hovering over us with the threat of nuclear war ever since. Like most Christopher Nolan movies, the film is told in a non-linear manner, with Robert being investigated in 1954 by the Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.) with a panel led by Gordon Gray (Tony Goldwyn) with Roger Robb (Jason Clarke) serving as special counsel. The hearing has one goal: to discredit Oppenheimer’s name, ensure his security clearance gets revoked, and he never has a say in national defense ever again. Why is this happening? And how could it be happening to the man who led the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, which led to the most significant scientific breakthrough in human history, which singlehandedly ended WWII? There was a point where Oppenheimer was not only considered a hero but the most important man in the world. However, this is the era of McCarthyism. Unfortunately, Oppenheimer’s associations with known communists like his mistress Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) and his far-left extreme opinions on politics have made him a threat in the eyes of the United States government to national security when in reality, the creation of the atomic bomb in the hands of those in power and their egotistical need to maintain their superpower status poses a far greater danger to society as it provokes other countries to speedily develop their own nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Allowed to give a statement at the hearing, which will hopefully speak to his integrity, character, and patriotism, Oppenheimer’s story is told in a series of flashbacks. Everything taking place in the past from Oppenheimer’s point of view is told in color, while sections of the film told from Lewis Strauss’ (Robert Downey Jr.) point of view are presented in black and white. As chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission (A.E.C.), Strauss is seeking a cabinet position in Eisenhower’s administration as Secretary of Commerce. Through Strauss’ testimony and line of questioning about his relationship with Oppenheimer, Nolan weaves a complex but captivating three-hour-long story of inflated ego, fear, power, discovery, and moral torment. It’s his talkiest film to date, with numerous conversations taking place between characters in rooms, discussing scientific terms and jargon many might have forgotten from their high school physics days. Still, if anyone knows how to craft an immersive cinematic experience despite heavy exposition, it’s Christopher Nolan. And an ample reason why “Oppenheimer” succeeds on the same thrilling level as something like “The Social Network” or “J.F.K.” is because, like those films, of its brilliant script and compelling performances from its actors. As the opening quote of the film states, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind. For it, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity. In an act of martyrdom, Oppenheimer never once fights back against the A.E.C. and instead upholds his innocence, hoping the truth will eventually reveal itself. Cillian Murphy, who has worked with Christopher Nolan a few times before, is finally given a leading role to show the world on such a large canvas what he is capable of, and the result is the culmination of years of hard work in a performance that is nuanced, tormented and entirely engaging. Murphy completely throws himself into the role of Oppenheimer, shouldering the massive film on his back (he’s in nearly every scene) as he takes us through his soaring highs and crushing lows. Aiding Murphy’s portrayal is how Nolan places the audience inside Oppenheimer’s head, using a jolting soundscape, stunning practical visual effects (we see how Oppenheimer views the world through particles and atoms), and a superb score from Ludwig Göransson featuring a satisfying blend of classical orchestral instrumentation such as the violin and electronic sounds such as synths and Geiger counter sound effects. But Murphy is not alone. In a cast this enormous, some performances will stand out more than others inevitably, but the one who towers above them all is Robert Downey Jr. as Lewis Strauss. Freed from the shackles of CGI-infested films and finally allowed to provide a performance that will remind audiences what a singular talent he is, Downey, much like his character, emerges from the shadows and ignites the screen whenever he’s featured. Just as the confirmation hearing starts to possibly not go his way, his third-act meltdown is riveting to watch and just as exciting as any action sequence Nolan has given us in his career. Wearing some subtle makeup, it’s refreshing to watch Downey lose himself in a character and let loose in a project where an electrifying performance can be just as exhilarating as an action setpiece. Other supporting turns worth mentioning include Benny Safdie as hydrogen bomb creator Edward Teller. With a thick Hungarian accent, Safdie dives deep into a character who clashes morally and scientifically with Oppenheimer (as many do throughout this movie). Safdie completely disappears on screen, just as he did with his transformative performance in “Good Time,” and is another example of what a promising career he will have as a character actor. Matt Damon adds some nice moments of levity and charismatic, commanding screen presence as General Leslie Groves, who oversaw the Manhattan Project. Oppenheimer wants to share his findings at Los Alamos with other scientists from all over the world so they can work together to create the atomic bomb faster than the Nazis. At the same time, Groves keeps pushing the phrase “compartmentalization” down everyone’s throats every second he can, hoping the secrets behind what they’re working on will not get leaked to America’s enemies. Despite their differences, an organic bond slowly develops between them, built on mutual respect. Josh Hartnett (nuclear physicist Ernest Lawrence), Casey Affleck (Boris Pash, an intelligence officer investigating Oppenheimer with a deep disdain for communism), Kenneth Branagh (Niels Bohr, a renowned nuclear physicist, and Oppenheimer’s idol), David Krumholtz as (Isidor Isaac Rabi, a nuclear physicist with moral doubts over creating the atomic bomb), Tom Conti (Albert Einstein, yes, that one), Alden Ehrenreich (as Strauss’ aide), and Macon Blair as Oppenheimer’s legal counsel during the A.E.C. hearing all receive moments to shine within Nolan’s immense screenplay. Even Rami Malek, who you may think has no lines when he’s first introduced due to the size of the cast and maybe just said yes to the project because he wanted to work with Nolan, plays a pivotal role later in the film. And this isn’t even mentioning Matthew Modine, David Dastmalchian, Jack Quaid, Dane DeHaan, and countless others, including one surprising cameo from an Academy Award-winning actor doused in makeup who shares a chilling scene with Oppenheimer after the atomic bomb has been used in Japan. Despite all these names and the wonderful opportunities they receive to display their craft, Nolan still struggles to present fully dimensional and absorbing female characters. The film’s most prominent female characters are the two most important women in Oppenheimer’s life, his mistress Jean Tatlock (Pugh) and Katherine “Kitty” Oppenheimer (Emily Blunt). Each is undercut by the film’s fluctuating pacing every time their performances start to gain steam in the story. While Blunt fares better than Pugh (who is primarily presented nude in some of the most awkward scenes Nolan has ever directed) when it comes to screentime and is afforded a particular crowd-pleasing moment near the film’s end, the talented British actress has to resort to drunken, exasperated, tearful theatrics to make her character stand out in this sea of men. She does a decent job with the material she’s given, even elevating it sometimes. Still, one cannot help but feel frustrated that her relationship with Oppenheimer wasn’t more than simply a rebellious for the time, devoted wife role. Of course, this being a Christopher Nolan film, the technical crafts are all spectacular. Hoyte van Hoytema’s gorgeous photography, whether it’s of the New Mexico landscape (shots of Kitty and Oppenheimer on horseback makes you wonder what a Christopher Nolan-directed western would look like) or the black and white sequences (which he and Nolan created black and white IMAX film stock specifically for this film), there is never a moment where you’re not in awe of the images he’s putting on screen. Nolan continuously blends the epic with the intimate, and it all culminates in the detonation of the Trinity Test. After building up the tension, backed by Göransson’s pulse-pounding score, the sheer emotional release from when that button is finally pushed (there was a “near zero” chance the chain reaction from the detonation could set fire to the atmosphere and destroy the entire planet) combining horror and wonder is nothing short of a cinematic miracle. As Oppenheimer says, “Theory will only take you so far,” but with everything caught for real, in camera, by Nolan and Hoyte van Hoytema, with no CGI whatsoever, the final results are enough to reaffirm your belief in the power of cinema and what it can achieve when you have a master storyteller utilizing every resource possible and the best collaborators in the world to offer the audience something poignantly unforgettable. Four thousand people worked on the Manhattan Project for three years with a budget of $2 billion to create a weapon that forever changed the world and gave us “the power to destroy ourselves.” What should’ve been seen as a great triumph slowly turned into a terrifying nightmare where one man’s reputation was destroyed, and the country never looked back once those two bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. We never see the dropping of the bombs nor the destruction they caused, but it’s alluded to; we see it on Oppenheimer’s face through Cillian Murphy’s astonishing performance, captured with such grandeur by Nolan and his team as his face fills the frame. A look plagued by guilt but forever wrestling with the scientific accomplishment he and the other scientists performed at Los Alamos. Such dichotomy is exemplified through Nolan’s refined storytelling as he plunges us into the past, takes us through a non-linear story, brings it all together in a grand finale only he can conjure, and takes us up to the present as the effects of “Oppenheimer” the film and Oppenheimer the man linger long after the final credits roll. Never before has a Christopher Nolan film felt this urgent and vital, making it not only a masterpiece of the historical biopic genre but a masterpiece of cinematic history in general.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Since 1998, Christopher Nolan has been a staple of cinema. From Following, his directorial debut, Nolan has shown that his directorial vision is one of the brightest. His films grew in size and budget as his career blossomed, leading studios to believe in the Academy Award nominee. Never afraid to step outside his comfort zone, every Nolan film offers a different and unique perspective from the visionary. While Nolan has earned a blank check throughout the years with films like The Dark Knight and Inception under his belt, his last movie Tenet garnered the most divisive response yet. While a fan of this Lynchian style blockbuster, I longed for a grounded, meditative film from Nolan, and his latest film captures that essence beautifully. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer is a relentless and roaring cinematic achievement. Nolan breathes fresh air into the possibilities of the “Summer Blockbuster” with a nuanced, dense, and inventive character study that highlights the power of man and their ability to self-inflict doom and peril. Adapted from American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, Oppenheimer tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist credited as the “father of the atomic bomb.” From the pivotal moments of early development to the aftermath of the bombing, the film dives deep into the man and those surrounding him. In what could be Christopher Nolan’s best screenplay thus far, Oppenheimer weaves through a three-act structure that can be divided into these unique entities; a rich character-driven deconstruction, a tense-filled thriller, and a politically laced courtroom drama. The sum of its parts equals Nolan’s demonizing man’s ego and desire to destroy political clout and growth. A theme that is a dooming warning to the ideology of “history repeating itself.” Nolan’s direction is as confident as ever as he delivers a stirring and haunting crowning achievement. Yes, the swings are bold but massively influential. Nolan directs his most operatic and personal film, drawing suspense from the most simplistic moments. Oppenheimer’s grandiose scale goes toe to toe with Nolan’s screenplay and direction. Hoyte van Hoytema continues to impress as one of the best cinematographers. The film, shot with 70mm IMAX cameras, stands as one of the crowning achievements of IMAX with astonishing visuals that are set to leave with cinephiles upon the film’s conclusion. In a career that already includes an Academy Award, Ludwig Göransson’s score is his most impressive yet. Entirely responsible for Oppenheimer‘s stakes and tension, Göransson constructs a score that will leave audiences hypnotized and stands as the year’s best score. The film’s sound design is impeccable and feels like a culmination of Nolan’s work with sound throughout his career. Oppenheimer is it. It’s the cherry on top. There’s no denying the film stands on the performance of Cillian Murphy. Finally landing a lead role in a Nolan film, Murphy seizes his opportunity with a tour de force performance capturing a genius’s moral torment and ambiguity. It’s a performance that demands his name to be called on Oscar nomination morning. Robert Downey Jr. spent the better part of 11 years in the MCU, and his performance in Oppenheimer feels as if the shackles of the MCU were left in the dust. Downey offers a thunderous, Oscar-worthy performance that is one of his career’s best. Speaking of Oscar, Emily Blunt is sublime as Oppenheimer’s wife, Kitty. With a film-stealing moment that had our entire press screening clapping, this performance should finally land Blunt the Oscar nomination she richly deserves. Oppenheimer is a cinematic miracle. Perfectly capturing the spirit of JFK and The Social Network, Oppenheimer cements its place as the best film of 2023 and one of the greatest biopics ever.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," From the moment Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer dropped its first teaser trailer more than a year ago, a clock has been counting down throughout its existence in not just video form, but on promotional materials displayed in cinemas around the world. One could have suspected that they were ticking towards the release date of the film, but those with a cleverer eye concluded that the countdown was inching second by second to the exact date, July 15, when the Trinity test was conducted in Los Alamos by Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his team of scientists, and thus the confirmed birth of the atomic bomb and the subsequent end to World War II. In the moments after the test is concluded, and its success is confirmed, you would think its creator would be as celebratory as the fellow scientists and military personnel he worked closely with for years are in the creation of this powerful weapon. But he isn’t because he knows what their work has done. It’s changed the world, for better and for worse, and any jubilation quickly turns into fear and paranoia that he can’t shake. Within a three-hour tense, pulse pounding historical epic about one of the most fascinating people to ever live on this planet, Christopher Nolan has delivered a truly haunting piece of cinema about the dangers of the bomb, how it crumbled the man that created it, and how corrupt the systems and institutions we put our faith into fail us once we lean on them, making for a damning showcase of American exceptionalism. When we first meet Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), he is in a vulnerable position, having to defend himself against an advisory board that is looking to take away his security clearance and soil his distinguished reputation post his time on the Manhattan Project. Since the creation of the bomb, he has made a lot of enemies, both in the political and scientific communities, and now they are coming for him at from all sides, looking to take down the self-proclaimed “prophet.” Against the advice of his lawyers, he sets out to clear his name, and in typical dramatic biopic fashion, lays the groundwork for the audience to follow him back to before the bomb, when he was a young American student in Europe in the 1920s, tossing and turning in his sleep at the endless possibilities his work in theoretical physics could bring to the world. It’s here where Nolan uses these moments to brilliantly capture the essence of what it looks like inside the mind of a genius like Oppenheimer, and how their work is molded at such a young age through nothing but black matter, soundwaves, and particles forming the math that would make him a household name in the scientific community across the world.  Over the course of the decade, during his time overseas, he meets multiple men that see the potential of his genius, including Niels Bohr (Kenneth Branagh), the legendary Danish physicist whose early contributions were the launching pad for Oppenheimer’s life work and a vessel to open up his curiosity at such a young age. Bohr suggests to the young Oppenheimer to travel around the continent, asking questions to all of those who will answer, thus expanding his mind and opening up his inspiration. Nolan cuts back and forth from the particle sequences to social encounters seamlessly in dazzling fashion, with Oppenheimer even briefly meeting Werner Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), the German physicist who he would be racing against to build the bomb. Nolan uses these scenes to convey that before the chase for building a weapon of death, there was a time when men and women of science could come and just share ideas. But the looming World War quickly ends those pleasantries and begins the arms race for global dominance.  By the time we reach the 1930s, while his name is growing, his ambition and longing to return home to share his findings with his American counterparts reaches its breaking point. When he is given the chance to lead a theoretical physics department at Cal Berkeley, he jumps right into it, and by the mid-1930s, in just a couple of years, he builds the top scientific academic department in the entire country. As he is teaching by day, he is learning and experimenting by night with various social clubs in the area, with some ties to radical ideas that lead to the Communist Party. In an evening that will haunt Oppenheimer for the rest of his night, he meets Jean Tatlock (played by an underutilized Florence Pugh), a young woman and member of the Communist party who has an on and off relationship with Robert for many years. Drawn to her like a moth to a flame, they carry on their love affair even after Oppenheimer marries Kitty (Emily Blunt), whose own complicated past has led to her fourth marriage once she tied the knot with Robert due to their affair leading to her becoming pregnant with their first child. Blunt, who much like Pugh, is not given a lot of time within this grand story, but nails every moment she is in the film, playing Kitty as a woman trapped in a life she doesn’t want to be a part of, trying to find relief at the bottom of a bottle of booze. Her standout moment is towards the end of the film, where she showcased the fire Kitty has for her husband in a moment where he needs her more than ever.  Between his scandalous love life, his friendship with Haakon Chevalier, whose Communist ties link him back to Russia based on the FBI findings, and his push and pull relationship with his Berkeley colleague Ernest Lawrence (an exceptional Josh Hartnett), there is no way that Oppenheimer, who knows that a team is being assembled to create a bomb before the Nazis do, can join. But in a moment of compromise with Lawrence over settling down his involvement with any radical affiliations, he is accepted as a member of the team in 1942, and later appointed the director of the project by Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (a spectacular Matt Damon). Murphy and Damon’s chemistry shines in not just their first interaction as two men from different mindsets colliding into each other to create this bomb, but throughout the whole film as two men who are just doing what they think is right to make sure their mission is complete, even if there are still reservations about each other long after the button is pushed. Between Air earlier this year and this performance, Damon is consistently delivering some of his best work to date. In the creation of the team behind the atomic bomb lies Los Alamos, the location where most of the film takes place. Oppenheimer recruits not just dozens of the top minds from across the allied countries (including wonderful supporting performances from Benny Safdie, David Krumholtz, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, and Olivia Thirlby just to name a few) but also wants their families to come too so that the members of the team are putting their best work forward. Ruth De Jong’s expertly detailed production design takes us back to a place that was entirely created for the sole purpose of this mission’s success. By creating this community, it is presented as the backdrop to one of the scariest moments in human history due to the slight chance that all of the work done by Oppenheimer’s team could create a device that would turn the world’s atmosphere into fire and the people who live in it into ash. In what is his best screenplay to date, Nolan takes the renowned Pulitzer Prize winning biography American Prometheus (a title lifted and placed into the dialogue of the film), and creates an equally rich and dense piece of writing that contains a multitude of layers, while (reportedly) told in the first person, to allow the reader to access Oppenheimer’s thought process.  He ping pongs dialogue back and forth between each character, allowing the audience to feel the tension rise between each conversation as we get closer and closer to the Trinity test. By doing this, when Oppenheimer states “They won’t fear it until they understand it. And they won’t understand it until they’ve used it,” the urgency in dialogue is that of an enormous burden that is close to being lifted off their shoulders once their mission is complete. These moments are mixed together with an unbelievable score from Oscar winning composer Ludwig Göransson, allowing the film’s pace to never slow down and continue to rise till the bombastic sound demonstrated throughout is completely cut off, and we emerge into the shoes of Oppenheimer as his test is pulled off in elegantly, terrifying style by Nolan and his excellent cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. It is the crown jewel of this entire film and one of the best cinematic moments of Nolan’s filmography, fully using the wide IMAX frame to capture every angle of the horror an atom bomb can create. But beyond the science and the war lies the real enemy of Oppenheimer’s work, and they comprise the very same men, both military and political, that put him in charge of creating the bomb in the first place, most notably Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Strauss, a self-made business man and naval officer with massive political connections, served as a member of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission and had a direct ear to the President. Shown from his perspective (in black and white photography) and Oppenheimer’s point of view (in technicolor), Strauss saw the potential for what these weapons could do for the future of the military for the United States and fought against Oppenheimer left and right to make sure that the “H Bomb” project went forward with or without Robert. In a career best performance, Downey Jr. brings a masterful level of menace to a man filled with jealousy over Oppenheimer’s accomplishments, all because he didn’t agree with his adversary’s cautionary personal opinions post the time of the drop of the atomic bombs in Japan. Downey’s superstar appeal is cleverly used to have the audience in the palm of his hands, only to tear every ounce of trust apart when you realize the personal destruction he has caused to Oppenheimer’s legacy, thus creating a sinister antagonist that represents not just the pettiness of one man, but of the many who are so power hungry, they don’t realize that they are just as dangerous as the bombs they want our country to create. The brilliance of Downey’s work also falls heavily on the shoulders of editor Jennifer Lame’s essential work as she takes these two opposing visual points of view and melds them together effortlessly to where you get the full picture as to just how low Strauss went to make sure Oppenheimer was a name he never had to worry about again. Between its stellar supporting cast, incredible direction, rich screenplay, and exquisite technical crafts, Oppenheimer is a great film but it is taken to the next level with the deeply committed performance from Cillian Murphy. In his first lead role for Nolan, his longtime collaborator, Murphy expertly delivers a portrait of a man that is so smart that by the time his work is complete, and the rest of the world breaks him, he is left a shell of himself. Dozens of shots throughout the movie show a slender face attached to a pencil thin body that’s soul is deteriorating through every interrogation in his hearing (done by a devilishly good performance by Jason Clarke), or memory of the impact the bomb has had on the citizens of Japan. Even when he meets President Truman (Gary Oldman) and tells him that he feels like he has “blood on his hands,” Truman’s cold response shatters him, leaving a lasting impression on Murphy that lingers throughout the final act of the film. It’s a career-best performance for Murphy, and in this all encompassing role, he is able to showcase why he is a generational talent that should have more leading roles in films.  It is no secret to filmgoers by now that Christopher Nolan is obsessed with the concept of time, and uses it in almost every one of his films. And yes, telling the story of one man’s life over a three-hour film is enough of an exercise of time within itself, but what he does with it here is the most important use of his filmography. He looks at time, or in this case, Oppenheimer’s legacy, from his most cynical point of view yet, as he showcases how a man’s life and career can be demolished and rewritten in a matter of months if they don’t go along with those who aim to destroy the world. At the same time, it’s also about how a person can give so much to the world around them only for their achievements to be washed away as though they are treated like a war criminal. Nolan takes aim at the US government, world leaders, and the scientific community for letting Oppenheimer’s name get dragged through the mud so they can fill their pockets, grab more public and internal power, and continue to benefit off of something they won’t fully understand. This film is by no means a celebration of this historic achievement, and like Oppenheimer, there is no way to not feel hopeless and terrified about the world’s ongoing obsession with countries stockpiling nuclear weapons. Oppenheimer is a film that will live shoulder to shoulder with other historical biopics like Lawrence of Arabia, The Insider, Malcolm X, and JFK that showcased an important moment or figure in history and had the presence of mind to ask the audience hard questions about humanity as they are walking out of the theater. Nolan, whose last three features explored the topics of human survival, World War II, and nuclear annihilation, brings all of those ideas together to create not only his best film since The Prestige but the best film of the year so far and an early contender for the best film of the decade.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer is a dense and horrifyingly brilliant character study, with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR delivering career-defining performances. It’s experimental, gut-wrenching, and masterfully shot and scored. Christopher Nolan cements himself as an all-time great director. When it comes to the conversation of the best director in Hollywood, few directors rival the visionary storytelling prowess of Christopher Nolan. With Oppenheimer, Nolan might just be at his most experimental. The experiment that Nolan puts together here is not a storytelling one, as films like Interstellar, Memento, and Tenet have all of that in spades. This time around, Nolan takes a crack at making a horror film, grounded in the starkest of realities. As he adds Oppenheimer to his resume, Nolan is now in the conversation for the greatest director of all time and the film stands as the best of 2023. Oppenheimer transcends the concept of entertainment, instead opting to immerse audiences in a narrative that leaves the viewer uncomfortable, nauseous, and shaken up. Nolan’s direction in Oppenheimer features many of his trademark styles. From the non-linear screenplay to the crescendo in the third act that Nolan is known for, there is a masterful command over the medium of cinema in each element of the film. Simply put, Oppenheimer is near perfect as a cinematic achievement, with multiple layers of complexity, full reliance on practical effects over CGI, and grand-scale set pieces that break the line between reality and film. There is brutal authenticity of Oppenheimer takes advantage of the audience’s knowledge of the character, yet completely horrifies them with each subsequent scene. Cillian Murphy leads the ensemble for Oppenheimer with a career-defining performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy’s performance can be described as a tour de force, encapsulating the complexities of the man with a haunting intensity and continuous dead look in the eye. Murphy perfects the feeling of watching a dead man walking. The audience knows who Oppenheimer is, they know what his impact on world history is, and they know the blood on the man’s hands. Murphy’s Oppenheimer doesn’t, and it is absolutely gut-wrenching to see that reality set in as he goes from a renowned physicist to the destroyer of worlds. With every subtle gesture and piercing glance, Murphy completely dissects Oppenheimer’s psyche, revealing the very soul of the man. It is safe to say that Murphy has a leg up on the awards cycle for Best Actor. Perhaps the greatest surprise Oppenheimer is Robert Downey Jr., who takes on the role of Lewis Strauss, Former United States Secretary of Commerce and a key figure in the life of Oppenheimer. Downey Jr has always been an incredible actor, but it has gotten lost in the shuffle amongst the mind of the mainstream as they’ve come to associate the actor with his Marvel Studios counterpart in Iron Man. Here, Downey Jr. flexes completely different muscles and absolutely excels with magnetic energy and charisma. Like Murphy, Downey Jr. should be a shoo-in for the awards circuit. A Best Supporting Actor nomination might just be a lock.  Outside of these two incredible actors, Oppenheimer boasts an incredible ensemble. Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, Rami Malik and Gary Oldman in particular absolutely shine with captivating performances that perfectly balance history with nuance and drama. Each of them delivered incredibly dense performances that perfectly encapsulates the great script and screenplay.  Complementing the remarkable performances and direction is Ludwig Göransson. The notes and rhythms in this film are a cross between a horror film and classical music. This composition completely blends Oppenheimer’s madness and internal conflict. The bombastically chilling score by Göransson dives deep into the character with motifs and themes that can lull you into complacency and stun you with a harrowing reality. The score is haunting and evocative, which swells and recedes with perfect precision. In a film that features the best ensemble that a Nolan film has ever had, Göransson continues to prove his chemistry with Nolan is on par with Zimmer. Overall, Oppenheimer is a cinematic masterpiece and perhaps the most important film in Christopher Nolan’s unparalleled resume. With awe-inspiring performances by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., and a horrifyingly brilliant character study at its core, Oppenheimer is an achievement in cinema and the best film of 2023.",POSITIVE
"Jul 19, 2023"," Oppenheimer feels like the movie that Christopher Nolan was always destined to make: a biopic about one of the world's most famous (or infamous, depending on your viewpoint) theoretical physicists, J Robert Oppenheimer. The likes of Tenet and Interstellar saw Nolan use theoretical physics to make original sci-fi movies that get the pulse racing and engage your brain. Sometimes they engaged the brain so much that the brain actually hurt and the movies didn't quite hold together, but in Oppenheimer, Nolan gets to work with real-world physics – and still make your brain hurt a bit. In any other hands, a three-hour biopic about the ""father of the atomic bomb"" would sound like a bore. In Nolan's hands, however, it transforms into a biopic as a thriller, a countdown to a moment that genuinely could have ended the world and had ramifications that continue today. Oppenheimer ends up being a bit too sprawling for its own good, but it's still a towering achievement and an unforgettable experience, led by a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy. Unsurprisingly, Oppenheimer is no standard 'cradle to the grave' biopic, something you could assume would be anathema to Nolan. The master of structural playfulness, Nolan tells J Robert Oppenheimer's story from two viewpoints, switching back and forth throughout. The first timeline (""Fission"") plays out in colour and centres on Oppenheimer's past, the build-up to the Trinity Test and beyond. The second (""Fusion"") plays out in black and white and takes place in the late 1950s, mostly centred on Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and his fraught relationship with Oppenheimer. By Nolan's standards, it's a relatively straightforward structure. There are so many characters and weighty issues at play, though, that it can be dizzying, especially as Nolan gives us little and throws us right into the action.  Reuniting with Tenet editor Jennifer Lame, Nolan makes Oppenheimer feel like the fastest three-hour movie ever and it's expertly edited. There's so much to condense, though, that it's almost inevitable some aspects get short-changed, especially Oppenheimer's relationship with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). Minor complaints aside, Oppenheimer is still an astonishing technical feat and an immersive theatrical experience like no other this year. It's not just the epic scale of the IMAX-filmed cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, it's every part of the craft that makes it a true cinematic event. You might wonder how the Trinity Test could really compel, given we know how it all plays out. But when Oppenheimer gets to it, you'll really end up wondering if it will destroy the world as all aspects, from the ominous score by Ludwig Göransson to the inventive practical effects come to a breathtaking crescendo. All the technical brilliance would mean nothing without the human at the centre of it: in Cillian Murphy, Nolan found the ideal fit for Oppenheimer's enigmatic personality, especially as the physicist wrestles with the moral dilemmas involved in what he was trying to achieve. It's a challenging role that asks a lot of Murphy, but he's sensational. Nolan doesn't want to tell you what to think about Oppenheimer, and Murphy brings all the various aspects of Oppenheimer's personality into a compelling whole. Some of the most striking sequences are the simplest, such as an extreme close-up of Murphy's face as Oppenheimer weighs up the haunting aspects of what he's done. Oppenheimer is definitely Murphy's movie, but there is strong support among the extensive cast. Lewis Strauss is Robert Downey Jr's meatiest role in some time, nuanced and unpredictable (especially if you don't know the story), while Emily Blunt is excellent as Kitty Oppenheimer, every bit his equal but dealing with the frustrations of the era. There are other notable turns, including Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves Jr, director of the Manhattan Project, and Benny Safdie as Edward Teller, a fellow theoretical physicist who doesn't always agree with Oppenheimer's viewpoint.  There are so many characters, in fact, that not everybody can make an impact. This becomes more apparent as the movie goes past the Trinity Test to what happened to Oppenheimer after it. Characters who had minor appearances from the Fission timeline end up having a big impact in the Fusion timeline, but so much has passed that you could struggle to remember who they were. Given the subject matter Nolan is dealing with, it's a remarkable achievement that he's even managed to condense American Prometheus (the book it's based on) into a cohesive movie. You won't exactly come out of it knowing theoretical physics, but it's told so expertly that you will be able to have an opinion. And Oppenheimer is absolutely a movie that you'll want to discuss and chew over for days after first viewing. It's an absorbing and spectacular watch first and foremost, but also one that provokes you to think about the big, weighty topics that arose from Oppenheimer changing the world. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Jul 19, 2023"," It’s an all-star revisiting of an epic undertaking, the race to build a bomb “before the Germans get one,” envisioned as a cinematic whirlwind of science, history, intrigues and tragedy. Riding on the shoulders of a haunted performance by Cillian Murphy in the title role, a subtly-shaded turn by Robert Downey Jr., the bluff, blunt and funny presence of Matt Damon and a brilliantly brittle interpretation of Oppenheimer’s wife by Emily Blunt, it’s a magnificent film, head-and-shoulders above every other movie of the summer, and not just in its ambition. Nolan’s script, based on the book “American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,” sweeps us through the genius physicist’s academic achievements as the “man who brought quantum mechanics to America,” his mastery of any subject that entered his field of vision, his masterly management of The Manhattan Project, a very smart man’s dalliance in liberal-to-left-wing politics, his humanism and his womanizing.  Murphy’s Oppenheimer has the faraway eyes of a dreamer, with Nolan slipping vivid imaginings of what that mind was “seeing” when he pondered black holes and the physics that runs the universe. And this “Oppie” has the cocksure quick wit and swagger of a someone who knew he was the Smartest Man in the Room, and acted — sometimes recklessly, sometimes humorously — on that confidence. “Why don’t you have a Nobel Prize?” Army officer/West Point-and-MIT-educated engineer Leslie Groves (Damon) bluntly asks the man he wants to manage the “Manhattan” project when they meet. The story is framed within Oppenheimer’s closed-hearing “trial” which revoked his security clearance in 1954, with his critics and defenders facing judgement from the likes of Gordon Gray (Tony Goldwyn) and grilling from judge/prosecutor, Roger Robb (Jason Clark).  The thread that runs through those scenes and spreads into the flashbacks that recreate Oppenhimer’s much-documented life story is “Who’d want to justify their whole life?” He can dismiss ill-informed questions about why he didn’t attend the finest physics program in America, at Berkeley, with “Because I hadn’t built” that program yet. But studying in Britain and especially the world’s enemy, Germany, was seen as a red flag in his life story. Oppenheimer’s attraction to the mercurial, unromantic communist Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is shown, and when this “questionable association” is revisited in his security clearance hearing, their sexual encounters migrate from hotel rooms to his chair in the hearing chambers, both of them naked before his accusers.  The story of Oppenheimer’s life is reflected in the great figures who were his peers — Kenneth Branagh is somberly playful as the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr, Tom Conti is the weary, elderly Einstein, Josh Hartnett is Nobel prize-winner Ernest Lawrence, Benny Safdie is an always-sweaty H-bomb champion Edward Teller.  Through it all, the politics of the era pass by outside the halls of academia and later the hastily-built city of Los Alamos. Oppenheimer knows Marxism and its limitations because he read “Das Kapital” in “the original German.” He supported the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, because only fascists didn’t, and his brother and sister-in-law became “card carrying communists” and he wouldn’t distance himself from them because they were his brother and sister-in-law. Nolan shot Congressional hearings and media scrums surrounding the Oppenheimer of the 1950s in the black and white of TV memory, and the epic story of Los Alamos and the life that led up to it in vivid color, folded into flashbacks within these frames. Nolan’s films are famous for their sound design, and here that’s most impressive in the Trinity sequence, stunning silence underscoring the (non digital) pillar of boiling fire created by the world’s first atomic bomb, shattering noise erupting not just when the shock-wave of the blast passes over the scientists and soldiers, but when the shock of what they’ve achieved and what he’s wrought rattles Oppenheimer. This brisk but long film’s third act delivers a clever echo of that shock, when Oppenheimer plays to the crowd at a celebratory gathering of those who worked on the project, stunned by their noisy enthusiasm even as he is almost as conflicted about this achievement as colleagues like Isidor Rabi (David Krumholtz, terrific) about the carnage their bombs wrought. The film balances the much-debated moral quandary of the fateful decision to drop bombs on a fanatical enemy whose war-criminal leadership would have never surrendered via characters and character studies. Oppenheimer is parked on the fence while Groves and others march on in a panicked rush and sensitive colleagues question how much “blood” they will have on their hands. When the movie makes points about what Hitler disdained as “Jewish science,” it hints at what might have played a role in Oppenheimer’s fall, an outspoken man in an era when America proved itself willing to remember anti-Semitism and forget the many Jewish scientists involved in bringing World War II to an abrupt end.  The filmmaker sees Oppenheimer as a war hero torn by his place in history, martyred by McCarthy Era politics, which isn’t necessarily a new or fresh take. There was a memorable BBC/PBS TV series — 1980’s “Oppenheimer” starred Sam Waterston — a good TV movie (1989’s “Day One” film David Strathairn as Oppenheimer, with Brian Dennehy as General Groves) and the ambitious but not-quite-epic 1989 feature “Fat Man & Little Boy,” which starred Paul Newman as Groves and Dwight Schultz as Oppenheimer. But Nolan gives us something like a definitive take on the man, his work and the times he lived in, a film with the science and scientists of “The Theory of Everything,” the tortured/martyred genius of “The Imitation Game” and the mad scramble headiness of America in a race against history’s villains of “The Right Stuff.” The only time this latest film on this controversial figure feels too long is the third act, which makes its “decline and fall” points, and then labors on to the point of belaboring.  In “Oppenheimer,” Nolan tells an epic story tacked onto an introspective, multi-faceted life, a hero in the Greek tragedy mold  — brilliant and focused, but a man who knew his flaws and conflicted enough about his work that he all but accepted his fate as just deserts for all the “blood on my hands.” Cast: Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Robert Downey, Jr., Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Mattew Modine, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Hartnett, Jason Clarke, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Olivia Thirlby, Dane DeHaan, Tom Conti and Gary Oldman.
