"Oct 5, 2023"," The pump has been primed for a return to the Shrek universe with a lively sequel to 2011’s Puss in Boots. Are there sufficient numbers of fairy tales that haven’t already been mined for laughs in the four Shrek movies? Yes. It took over a decade for DreamWorks Animation to return to the franchise that built it. Shrek flamed out after four films, but its the spin-off Puss in Boots that spawned this latest incarnation. Bringing back stars Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek as the titular Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws respectively, we learn that Puss has squandered his nine lives by living recklessly and only now that he’s on his last life does it begin to sink in just how risky his lives and attitude have been. After seeking refuge with a cat lady and meeting the overly sweet therapy dog Perrito (Harvey Guillén), he learns of a fabled fallen star that will grant one last wish to the person who gets there first. He’s not alone in his quest as Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo), Kitty, and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) are also after the star. All deliver strong vocal performances, creating a rich aural tapestry against which the mostly strong animation can stand out. The narrative is densely packed, but easy to follow and filled with the kind of laughs that once made Shrek, Shrek 2, and Puss in Boots such highlights in their respective years of release. Guillén is the standout in this cast. The film’s biggest issues come down to the choice of animation techniques for fight sequences, which makes the events feel a little choppy and overly stylized, like we’ve shifted from a traditional computer animated film to a 2D Japanese anime picture. Those sequences are brief and the amazing animation that surrounds them offsets a lot of those concerns. It’s surprising that a character that has been shelved for so long (in spite of the Netflix series) could still prove to be so delightful after all this time. In a sea of imitators and the fading of luminaries Disney and Pixar, it’s nice to see some studios still trying to reach for the stars. Goldilocks and the Three Bears provides the characters and a few sight gags for this film alongside the nursery rhyme Little Jack Horner. All of them get fleshed-out treatments that feel more like a part of the Shrek universe than the stand alone, Zorro-inspired Puss in Boots series. Yet, it feels like a natural extension with The Last Wish and that’s enough to keep the franchise buoyant for the foreseeable future.",POSITIVE

"Aug 9, 2023"," “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” Grade B+: This film is so good that your last wish should be that “Puss in Boots” tales have at least nine more cinematic lives. Puss in Boots – as perfectly voiced by Antonio Banderas – is living the carefree life of a scallywag hero. He has brazenly faced death so many times that he has gone through eight of his nine cat lives. The only way to protect his one remaining life is to go into retirement and hiding at the home of a very zealous cat lover. The script by Paul Fisher (“The Croods: A New Age”) has all of the basic elements that make this a fun film on a very elementary level while at the same time weaving in a very smart and sensitive story about life choices. It is designed that both young and old should find the tale equally as enjoyable. Banderas was always a great selection as the voice of Puss in Boots because of the swashbuckling tone he brings. The tabby hero sounds like a defender of men and a lover of women. The voice talent is flawless and the story emotionally solid but it is the animation style that truly elevates “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” Director Joel Crawford (“The Croods: A New Age”) takes the solid computer generated visual style of DreamWorks Animation and gives it a jolt by blending both 3D and 2D. The overall look is the detailed 3D approach that has been used throughout the “Shrek” franchise. But, Crawford blends in the kind of 2D CGI style that has movies such as “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” so popular. After more than two decades, the “Shrek” franchise could have become very stale. Instead, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” proves that with a smart script, a great voice cast and a fresh approach to the animation, it is possible for a production that comes way down the line to be superior to anything that has come before it in the franchise. “Resident Alien: Season Two” Grade B+: The cable series based on the comic books created by Peter Hogan and Steve Parkhouse continues to shine because of Alan Tudyk. His work is a close encounter of the hilarious kind. He plays Harry, a crash-landed alien who takes on the identity of a small-town Colorado doctor. He slowly begins to wrestle with the moral dilemma of his secret mission on Earth. Most of the success comes through Tudyk’s work that includes the challenge of showing how an alien would react to suddenly having to deal with a human body. Then there is the alien language that would have left many tongue-tied. “Magic Mike’s Last Dance”: Mike (Channing Tatum) is recruited to stage a dance production in London. Will be released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 18. “A Man Called Otto”: Tom Hanks plays a widow who is looking for an emotional escape but must first deal with a new neighbor. Will be released on DVD and Blu-ray starting March 14. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Aug 6, 2023"," Shrek is a film, cultural phenomenon, and bizarre internet meme that has pervaded every crevice of the modern popular zeitgeist. From bumbling toddler to cynical adult, the animation wonder has nothing but adoration (both earned and misguided) hurled at it. It not only challenged the notion of what CGI animation could accomplish but demolished the mold of what children’s movies could be— cleverly subverting classic fairy tales with bracing irreverence. The farting, utterly vulgar ogre revived the floundering DreamWorks Animation, catapulting them from the pits of oblivion overnight. Shrek 2 introduced the alluring, Zorro-Esque, and Antonio Banderas-voiced Puss in Boots. The swashbuckling, D’artagnan hat-sporting ginger tabby cat became an instant fan favourite, garnering his own spin-off movie in 2011 soon after the main Shrek quadrilogy concluded with a thud. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a long-awaited sequel that could have easily coasted off its recognizable property to a handsome box office return. Instead, DreamWorks, and director Joel Crawford, refused to play it safe, crafting one of the most cathartic animated experiences in recent memory. Brimming with inventive ideas and kaleidoscopic visuals, The Last Wish, not only injects vigour into the long-dormant Shrek franchise but is one of the greatest films of the year, period. The fearless Puss in Boots (Banderas, as silky-smooth as ever) is synonymous with laughing in the face of certain death, spending the better part of his nine lives performing death-defying feats— all of which are gloriously showcased in the raucously gorgeous opening. Not concerned with being on his last life, he comes paw-to-paw with a foreboding wolf (Wagner Moura), a cloaked bounty hunter with two short scythes who has meticulously waited for Puss to be on his final life. Bested for the first time, Puss flees towards retirement, settling into a cat lady’s home and languishing in the mundanity of domestication (rendered as a great homage to Apocalypse Now). He comes across the existence of a legendary wishing star that fell to earth eons ago when he’s accosted by the cockney Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her family of bears (Ray Winstone, Oliva Colman, and Samson Kayo). Alongside the show-stealing, impossibly naïve dog, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), and his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), the three embark on a journey to find the star and reclaim a fresh batch of new lives. All the while, vying against the Wolf, Goldilocks’ bears, and the villainous, sorcery-obsessed Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney). The plot has all the makings of a familiar adventure, and in its framework, it absolutely is. However, its execution separates it from its maudlin contemporaries. Utterly dripping with style, this swashbuckling adventure enters the domain of the awe-inspiring with pure visual potency, painting its great lesson on appreciating the life we have now with an ingenious, emotionally invigorating brushstroke. The dazzling animation excels on all fronts, creating depth with both its astonishing world and multifaceted character design. From the nuanced, utterly frightening Wolf to the grizzled, huntress-like goldilocks to Puss’s visage of inner turmoil, each character is imbued with noticeable layers. The Last Wish not only continues the franchise’s jocular amalgamation of popular fairy-tale characters but underpins it with a surprising level of maturity, fearlessly provoking its young audience into heavy conversations surrounding death, fractured families, and shattered trust. The sheer assortment of fantastical personalities—all varied, eclectic, and wholly interesting—are never wasted, each satisfyingly fulfilling their own arcs in service of a greater one. Goldilocks’s reason for pursuing the wishing star is markedly unexpected, yet fits the narrative with grace, while the irredeemable and feckless Big Jack Horner transforms his famed nursery rhyme into a stark motivator. The Wolf is a vividly realized personification of death, whose piercing red eyes and ominous whistle unearth Puss’s deep-seated fear of the inevitable every time he appears from the shadows. Even characters like the scrupulous Talking Cricket make an indelible imprint, despite their brief time on screen. The ever-shifting, transmogrifying world serves as a wonderful playground for the dynamic, propulsive action set-pieces. Straying from the more realistic style of its predecessors, the storybook-like animation revels in unbridled creativity. Not satisfied with just one domain, the studio brings forth a bevy of environments that morph from perspective to perspective, colliding onto themselves and transforming into something else entirely, and even more staggering. The result is equally treacherous and resplendent, wringing everything possible out of its familiar concept. The Last Wish is a rare animation marvel that astonishes with its visual prowess while deftly delivering mature lessons to a young audience. From the complex character design to its transportive worldbuilding, the film’s stellar multitudinous quality coalesces in a wholly cathartic finale. Though the ultimate route is predictable, the numerous shifting pathways and transformations are what make it truly memorable. Come for the cute cat, stay for the deceptively deep character.",POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023",FANTASTIC&#46; Exhilarating Action&#44; Phenomenal Animation&#44; Perfect Voice Acting&#44; &amp; an argument could be made for the best animated film of 2022&#33;&#160;,POSITIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Over the years Dreamworks has lost its notoriety for being an animation powerhouse. Scrapping its all-ages, edgy stories in favor of appealing to younger audiences.  The original fanbase of the animation studio is now adults, and it seems like they haven’t hit the right chord to usher in a new generation of fans. It has been 11 years since the first Puss in Boots and the Shrek franchise that ended in a flop but is still relevant in internet memes. It has taken a decade for the Dreamworks team to revisit the world of Far Far Away in a long-awaited sequel that revamps the entire Shrek franchise through Antonio Banderas’s sword-slinging cat.  Immediately jumping back into the world of Puss in Boots, the film gives the perfect reintroduction to the Spanish cat that feels like reconnecting with an old friend. The new animation style is in full effect with destruction and festivities.  Picking up a few years after the first film, Puss finds himself  at the top of life until he is hit with an existential crisis when he learns he has one life left.  For the first time in his life,  the invincible Puss is now fearful of death as it follows him around in the form of a wolf.   To keep a low profile, Puss moves into the stray cat haven of Mama Luna where he will waste the rest of his last life as an actual cat.  Hope is brought to him as he discovers there is a wishing star that will allow him to get his life back if he finds it. He is not the only one hunting down the star, a collective of characters including Goldilocks and the Three Bears and “Big” Jack Horner chase after him.  Add in Puss’s old Flame, Kitty Softpaws, to further complicate his task.  Puss, Kitty, and a scrappy dog Perro join forces to embark on a vibrant journey to get the star before their enemies do. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the literal wishing star Dreamworks has needed to fill the large gap created by its popular franchises ending.  Waiting over a decade to continue the story of Puss and his world was well worth the wait because this sequel delivers in every aspect. One of the most notable improvements is the animation style that is an into the spiderversification of Shrek with its changes between 24 and 12 frames to match the confidence of Puss.  The new style embodies the essence of who Puss is and allows it to take on a western style fitting the story of an aging hero facing death perfectly. Two styles of animation are combined, 2D hand-drawn and CG, that blend seamlessly together. This change makes the animation feel so exciting to watch as well as allows more creativity for the filmmakers behind the story to take the iconic character to gorgeous landscapes audiences haven’t seen before.  It is very comic book-esque that puts its audience right in the middle of the action through dynamic camera movement.   The darkness of the film makes it an outlier of Dreamworks Animation’s filmography by showing a visualization of the terror that haunts Puss.  The entire film is a gift for visual storytellers to pick up on different gags and details on multiple watches.  Animated films have been lacking recently with casting non-voice actors into leading roles. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish successfully avoids this by bringing back Antonio Banderas who has never been better.  He adds new layers to his character as he is experiencing emotions for the first time in his life. There is a sequence where Puss has a panic attack about his destined fate and it is handled with so much empathy by Banderas’s voice choices mixed with the imagery.  The new mix of characters from Florence Pugh, John Mulaney, and Olivia Colman are the perfect castings as they can bring their personalities into their roles that fit the context of the story.  For having so many characters, the script fleshes out each villain giving them their moments to shine. Whether it's Goldi and her family or the wolf and Puss, there is a lot of depth in these character decisions. Jack Horner is a traditional bad guy, but everyone else is given a chance for the audience to understand their desires or care for them.  11 years was well worth the wait for this animated masterpiece about making the most out of our lives and spending time with those we love.  This has become the blueprint for how to do an animated sequel that is not lazy but has heart and purpose. It is easily top-tier Dreamworks that will work with any age of moviegoer with its smart but not intimidating nature. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 24, 2023"," “This story is a fairytale…” reads the opening title card of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The spectacular adventurer, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), has returned to the silver screen. His life is as glamorous as one would expect for a swashbuckling feline, but all of that comes crashing down when a doctor (Anthony Mendez) tells Puss that he’s burned through eight of his nine lives. Puss hears of the famed Last Wish, a special fallen star that can grant one wish. Hot on his trail are other famed fairytale-characters-turned-villains: Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), her three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, & Samson Kayo), and Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Luckily, Puss won’t have to go on this journey alone. Accompanying him are an old friend, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and a new one, Perro (Harvey Guillén). The animation magically mixes the 3D style DreamWorks is known for with stunning elements of paint-like brushstrokes. By no means does this make Puss seem lifelike, but the strokes add warmth to the animation. The characters aren’t sleek, smooth, or perfect. There’s a rustic quality to the illustrations that proves Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is here to tell a different story. Something to separate itself from the rest of the DreamWorks portfolio and create a new style all its own. Like Puss’ own self-realization, the film and its titular character come into their own and stand far from the shadows of their origin.  Of course, the film is geared toward children and there’s a heartfelt message woven throughout the journey of Puss, Kitty, and Perro. The trials and tribulations of their travels are reminders of what’s important in life. It’s about friends, family, and love, and always has been. There are some throwback jokes to Puss’ signature pouty look and physical comedy that will surely delight the kids. Somewhat surprisingly, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish also has its creepy moments. Throughout the entire journey to the Last Wish, Puss is stalked by The Big Bad Wolf, aka Death, (Wagner Moura). The wolf is a looming force with bright red eyes who will not stop until he catches up to Puss. The audience’s hair will stand on end just like Puss’ in the scene that introduces The Big Bad Wolf. It’s the first time in the Shrek Cinematic Universe that this character is afforded the darkness of its fairytale origins. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the last-minute surprise of the year. The film has all the charm the audience has come to expect from the Shrek standout, but with a blindsiding amount of heart and humor.",POSITIVE
"Jul 14, 2023"," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (now on Netflix) was the first movie in the Shrek franchise in more than a decade, and by all means, should be nothing more than forgettable piffle for six-year-olds. But for the first time since Donkey first cracked wise and Shrek first cracked a fart, one of these movies is actually ABOUT something, and reaches a near-Pixar level of substantive achievement to boot. But unlike Pixar, this thoughtful kittycat adventure doesn’t prompt us to weep and dribble snot like mad, which frankly, has been getting a bit old. No, this Puss hits the sweet spot between thoughtful and delightful – something nobody expected in the least. The Gist: [WARNING: PENDING EXPOSITION] “This story is a fairy tale…” reads a title card, so I can lead off like so: Once upon a time, an actual star fell from the sky and created a dark, magical forest. And within that star was one wish, to be granted to whoever might find it. [END EXPOSITION] And now, to the adorable-kitten crap: The inimitable Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas, as ever) isn’t just a hero of legend and man-cat if infamy, but a bona-fide celebrity who can walk into a room and sing jaunty tunes and just be his own gigantically egotistical self, then devour the adoration like a wolf to a pile of BBQed sheep. His latest party is interrupted by a giant made of stone and moss and antlers and malevolent whimsy, and upon besting the towering beast with his pointy cutlass and pointier wit, Puss takes a bow and gets his bell rung. By an actual bell. DONG. It fell. And now he’s dead. But don’t worry! Cats have nine lives, y’know. Puss awakens and the doctor asks him to county how many he’s spent – there was the time with the bulls in Pamplona, and the other time when he cheated while playing poker with dogs, a drunken test of whether cats always land on their feet, etc. They’re adding up. Quickly. So quickly, he’s on his last life. Cue the oh-shit moment. And therefore, Puss pauses for a moment of self-reflection, which is something he really ain’t good at. He’s drowning his sorrows in a glass of the heaviest cream when a bounty hunter approaches him. He’s always got bounty hunters on his butt – blame notoriety and a little ethical compromise for that – but this one’s different. It’s Wolf (Wagner Moura), who appears with red eyes and a hooded cloak and a pair of sickles, and it’s pretty clear who he REALLY is. You know. The Big D. And for the first time in his lives, Puss is terrified, and runs away from a fight. All this is actually kind of funny in an existential-horror kind of way, and also in a cute-cat-acting-like-a-cute-cat kind of way. I mean, he gets drunk on heavy cream. It’s a balancing act. Anyway, Puss buries his hat and boots – the legend, the whole persona – and R-U-N-N-O-F-Ts to the home of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a crazy cat lady who’ll adopt any stray puddy who knocks on her door. She puts mittens and a bell on him and names him Pickles and he’s mortified and depressed and grows a big long beard, but at least he makes a pal in a chihuahua disguised as a cat, nameless but soon to be known as Perrito (Harvey Guillen). This is about when the plot really starts losing its mind, because a crime family consisting of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) wants the bounty for Puss. And this is when the fallen star/wish exposition makes itself relevant, because everyone here decides to quest for it, competitively, and Puss motivation is, he’ll wish for his nine lives back so he can resume being his old self. It ain’t gonna be easy, because Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and a bug that looks a lot like Jiminy Cricket (Kevin McCann) and Puss’ old nemesis Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) join the fray, making sure this all gets very complicated, much to our delight. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: Rango. It reminds me of Rango. And yes, that’s intended to be a compliment. One hell of a compliment. Performance Worth Watching Hearing: Far too often, celeb voice work in animated films is little more than a marketing tool hoping to lure us into the theater to hear, I dunno, Woody Allen voice an insect or whatever, with underwhelming results. But as the voice of Puss, Banderas has true spirit and character, and gives one of the more lively voiceover performances in recent memory.  Memorable Dialogue: Wolf confirms our suspicions about his identity: “I don’t mean it metaphorically or rhetorically or poetically or theoretically or in any other fancy way. I’m Death, straight up. And I’ve come for you, Puss in Boots.” Our Take: The Last Wish is ingenious in many ways: The character dynamics are richly layered, with Puss and Softpaws’ cynical me-firstisms countered by Perrito’s pure heart; Goldilocks and the Bears’ struggle to find happiness, you know, something that’s not too hot or too cold but just right; and Jack Horner’s concupiscence for power and fairy-tale artifacts, a never-ending desire for more more more that has incurably corrupted him. They all fight over a treasure map to the fallen star that offers everyone a different path through the forest, shifting its physical reality into psyche-traps for all parties – and this is where Puss stares down his mortality and wonders if he truly values who he is, what he’s done and where he’s headed. Heady stuff? Sure, but not always, and definitely not quite on the nose. Director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado take pains to make everything accessible to all audiences, a fairy tale with some classical Grimm underpinnings. The script is consistently funny, foregoing the snarky self-skewering that defined the Shrek franchise, swapping it for a more timeless sensibility consisting of whip-cracking one-liners and character-based comedy (although the references are still intact – keep your eyes peeled for nods to T2 and Sergio Leone’s spaghetti Westerns). Slapstick action is present, as ever, but not overdone, executed with crisp visual acumen and a welcome touch of experimentation (decelerated frame rates give it an almost comic-booky feel).  The film’s callow intelligence can’t be understated. Puss in Boots, infamous for his bloated sense of self-confidence, finds himself neck-deep in the quicksand of an identity crisis. We love the guy, but he needed to be taken down a peg for him to become someone of true depth and character. And so he becomes more than just a joke machine, blossoming into full, actualized personhood. Except he’s a cat. In boots. And a hat. With a little lappy tongue. And who can still do the poor-adorable-kitty thing with his eyes that’ll gooify you in seconds. But now we’re emotionally involved with his psychological well-being, something we surely never, ever thought would happen with a character in a Shrek spinoff. Who knew Puss in Boots could sink his claws in so deep?",POSITIVE

	                                    	Finally, an animated movie sequel that's worth the wait. One has come to expect little from computer animated franchise films these days – or any franchise films for that matter, but Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, a follow up to the 2011 film Puss in Boots, is both fun and thoughtful. Both Puss in Boots films have been directed by Joel Crawford with a stellar voice cast lead by Antonio Banderas as the sword-wielding showman, hero and fugitive cat. A spin-off from the ‘Shrek’ franchise, this is the story of a walking, talking cat who sings songs celebrating his own greatness. After he’s vanquished a menacing giant, a fallen bell sounds Puss’s death knell. A lifetime of shenanigans and adventures later, Puss learns that he has ploughed through eight of his nine lives. On doctor’s advice, he hangs up his hat and boots and opts for a sedentary and safe life as a pet, taking shelter with cat lady Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). He learns how to live as a domestic pet, eating cat food and sharing a litter with tens of other felines. “So, this is where dignity goes to die,” he mutters sardonically as he queues up for the communal litter trough. That’s until the cockney crime loving family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo) comes looking for Puss in Boots. They need his help to steal a map to the Magical Star. Fearing death and an end to his ‘legendary’ status, an invigorated Puss embarks on a quest to find the map, the star and make his last wish. A lonely but optimistic dog (Harvey Guillén), with aspirations of becoming a therapy dog, becomes his unsolicited sidekick. As they seek out the map, they also encounter Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss’s competition and former love interest. Screenwriters Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler build a fairy tale/ nursery rhyme multiverse into the story. Besides Goldilocks and the Three Bears, there’s also Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a supersized avatar of Little Jack Horner who stuck his thumb in a pie and pulled out a plum. Big Jack Horner is malevolent, avaricious pie-maker and collector of prized artefacts from Excalibur to a flying carpet, Magic nanny bag and unicorn horns. Another dark force is the red eyed wolf (Wagner Moura) who haunts and follows Puss. On this ride-or-die adventure, Puss learns many lessons. Among them trust, kinship, and breaking down his own hubris. The banter between Puss and Kitty —Banderas and Hayek—is especially fun. As she ribs him, he responds, “Mock me quietly please.” Through the little dog, Perrito, they learn the value of stopping to smell the roses. Animal wisdom for the soul is peppered into an energetic and fast-paced narrative with colourful 3D rendering that creates an amusing family film voiced by a top-notch cast.",POSITIVE
"Apr 14, 2023"," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the second installment of the Puss in Boots franchise and is definitely long overdue and one we didn’t know we needed. Like the 90s cartoon theme songs, this film did not need to go this hard, but it did. This time around instead of flying through the air and playing all the local kitties, Puss is grappling with debilitating anxiety and commitment issues, all while dealing with the impermanence of life and literally facing his demons. Who knew Puss in Boots would have me leaving the theater wanting to sort my F-ing life out?  The premise is simple. Puss (reprised by the iconic Antonio Banderas) is, of course, a household name in the thieving business. His ego is on 1000, and he’s wanted all over the land per yuushh. This time his days are numbered. While it’s true cats have nine lives, Puss has run out and is now on his last life. Knowing this he decides to retire to the grey havens where it is safe because he can no longer take the uncalculated risks he is known for. But whispers on the wind say that the location of the elusive wishing star has surfaced. The wishing star grants any wish to the person who finds it. The star fell to earth eons ago and has yet to be found. With Puss’s life on its last strand, he feels this is his chance to get his lives and his confidence back.  The story is solid with a band of characters all going through their own bouts of anxiety, loss, a lack of belonging, and some serious control issues. Jack Horner for one, (voiced by comedian extraordinaire John Mulaney.) Now Jack Horner is giving – sadistic repressed boy man. The unhinged need to command more than just his destiny but all those around him is due to his childhood trauma (obviously). While he was the apple of his and his fan’s eyes as a child, the pressure to keep putting thumbs in pies and the ridicule turned him into a callous monster. While he is the keeper of the map to the wishing star, he does not care who he has to off to make sure he takes ownership of that star. Throughout the story, there are several people trying to control their situations by all means necessary. Except for newcomer Perrito (voiced by Harvey Guillén), he is really just along for the ride. (More on him soon). Even Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek) who rejoins our protagonist Puss to steal her own wish. Kitty is hired to find the wishing star but obviously plans to double-cross her employer. You wonder why are Puss and Kitty not working together? You’d think she’s the one who got him to slow down and park his litter box. And she was! We learn later in the film he could not commit. (Contrary to his comment in the first Puss in Boots film). While everyone has a right to this iron throne of the wishing star one of the people trying to change their storyline and take back control of their narrative is Goldilocks (voiced by the one and only Florence Pugh!) Goldi is running around with her adopted family – the three bears. We got Mama Bear (Oscar winning actor Olivia Coleman), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo.) They are a band of grifters, a con family if you will. Goldi is promising this wishing star is their last big job to change their lives, yet she has other ideas to get back to her “real” family. She knows her true family is out there, and she deserves to be loved by her real parents and live a normal fairytale life. When I tell you I almost cried when Goldi revealed her truth and Mama Bear, with tears in her eyes says, “if this will make you happy let’s go get your wish.” DONE. This woman said flat out you raised me, but you’re not my family – and a true mama said, your happiness is what a mama is for! My unfertilized eggs gasped. Coming to the realization of your reality and taking stock of what you have has always been a tough spot for me. Not that I am shaming my family and looking for some other family, but the idea of always looking towards the future. Being in complete disbelief that I have everything now that I need to succeed and have the life I want. What’s the saying: it’s hard to see the forest through the trees? Now, this was only the tip of the emotional iceberg in this film.  What takes The Last Wish over the top is the introduction of Puss’s true villain. Puss doesn’t just retire when he recounts all his deaths, a character arrives ready to take Puss to his final grave. Wolf, the classic big bad arrives red-eyed and ready, wielding chained sickles with skills well beyond Puss’s abilities. Plus, he has an entrance whistle that could freeze the blood in anyone’s veins. This chills Puss to his core. This mans is terrifying. I found myself with goosebumps on my forearms every time he arrived. And I kept asking myself why? This is just a cartoon fictional character. I’m watching Antonio Banderas as a cat in boots for Bast sake! Why is this character so menacing and inescapable? Why is this so close to home? When you realize through the metaphor of is all, he is the reaper – death himself… the final chapter. The one you cannot beat.  I started to feel my heart rate rise and my breath quicken. I too have been struggling with the anxiety that comes with the thought of my final day on this earth. Death. It’s considered one of the five core fears in human existence. It’s “the fear of annihilation of ceasing to exist” –  Best Self. We cannot evade death, and for me it isn’t necessarily not knowing what is on the other side. It’s facing that big bad wolf, it’s the whistle on the wind and knowing it’s coming no matter what. Whether we go to heaven or see our loved ones once again is the self-soothing part for some. But the anxiety of the end begins with the imagination of my final moments, then I lose my breath and hot tears begin to well up and fall. It’s a wild thought that I saw this right in front of my eyes in the sweet, animated face of Puss.  In my life, I have been searching for ways to handle the anxiety of it all. As the Virgo I am, I analyze and rationalize my thoughts until it no longer scares me, or at least until it makes more sense and I reach acceptance. Puss ran from it as if a crafty escape would provide the freedom of relief. But in inexplicable ways, that whistle would creep in and hood shadowed red eyes would show up. For me, it came in the form of the Third Rail Project’s production of Grand Paradise. In an immersive live theater experience, I was guided around a number of storylines based on the promise of eternal life. In one moment, I was thrust into my own wake. Yes, I was asked to lay down, given flowers as four box walls were formed around me and visitors invited to look upon my body. At that moment, I was given a chance to analyze my final chapter. A glimpse into my funeral did not hurl me into a massive panic attack. It was calm, it was surreal, a true out of body experience and one that didn’t have the answers sway –  but let me peer through the veil into a universe unknown. I know that sounds epic compared to the Puss in Boots storyline, but it was one and the same. Puss was given the opportunity to truly understand and know the value of life itself and the value of the only life he has left.  So, Puss is walking through this labyrinth all the while pushing down and ignoring his anxieties. When those red eyes appear in the fray, Puss is hurdled into the clutches of death. At the final stretch when we’re so close to the star, Puss blacks out! He is running, just booking it. He’s trying to get away from something he knows he cannot escape. He’s hiding, he’s hyperventilating, and the hairs on his body are standing at attention. He’s gonna lose consciousness. Perrito comes running, and even he looks frazzled. He doesn’t know what to do. He just closes his eyes and lays his head on Puss’s chest. Puss pets him as his heart rate lowers, his breath regulates, and he comes back to reality. This almost made me cry. Like Toy Story 3 levels cry. It asked the question – what do we do when we are faced with our largest fears and self-soothing is not enough? The wolf came to claim Puss because his only treasure was the fact that he felt invincible. That he could just figure it all out on his own and had all the time in the world. This is the crux of his issues. He could not accept death and truly appreciate his life. We only have this one life, and we cannot spend it running from death or trying to beat it. We have to see the forest, enjoy the leaves, and see how the sun shines through the canopy. One day yes, this will fade, and all we have are the memories. People are what make life worth being alive. No matter how many lives you have. Ahh! It’s corny AF, but I care not! Puss in Boots is a teachable moment for all of us. Because even though all of the resources in the world are at our fingertips, we still find a way to ignore our needs and think we can do it all by ourselves. Now is Puss in Boots the reason I am able to get through panic attacks? No. Therapy and meditation is gonna have to come through too. But Puss in Boots telling this stories – right now brought a new level of acknowledgment to this Sh*t we’re all going through, and honestly, I’m thankful for that.  What a time we live in where our cartoon characters can give us the space to explore mental health and the importance of leaning on our community.

"Mar 5, 2023"," Home › Recommendation › Films To Watch › The bonus features included with “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” expound upon everything you might’ve noticed or secrets you missed entirely. Between Puss in Boots films there was an 11-year gap. 11 years where original voice actor Antonio Banderas (Desperado; Official Competition) played several supporting roles in other Shrek-related projects big and small, but not where the fearsome fighting feline took the lead. Rather than opt for a flimsy tale that would entertain audiences but would be ultimately forgettable, director Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and co-director Januel Mercado with a script from Paul Fisher (The Croods: A New Age) and Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch) made something that would push the boundaries of children’s entertainment, making that PG-rating bulge with each meticulously elaborate scene. Riding the line between the silliness of the Shrek Universe from which it came and something far more Grimm, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish explores the value of appreciating where you are and what you have as taking things for granted is an empty, lonely road. With the DreamWorks Animation adventure now out on home video, you can explore all this and more with the litany of included bonus materials. Though this is an initial review for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, in order to discuss the home release properly, we need to dig in just a little deeper requiring spoiling specific aspects of the film. Now that you’ve been warned, read on, if you dare. Assassin. Mercenary. Lover. Hero. Swashbuckling tabby Puss in Boots (voiced by Banderas) has been called many names and has lived many lives. Eight of them, to be exact. Now on his last life, in order to escape the clutches of the seemingly unstoppable bounty hunter Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), Puss retires to an old cats home, intending for the Legend of Puss in Boots to die with his dignity intact. What he doesn’t plan for, however, is that the enigmatic Wolf isn’t the only one looking for him and that the crime family of Goldie and the three Bears (voiced by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) want him in order to track down a fabled fallen star. Seeing an opportunity to regain the lives he’s lost, Puss gets back in the saddle, unaware that all he could wish for might well be his already. L-R: Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Goldi (Florence Pugh), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) in DreamWorks Animation’s PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH, directed by Joel Crawford. © 2022 DreamWorks Animation. All Rights Reserved. Of all the characters that have teamed up with Shrek over the years, I’ve never quite gelled with Puss. Especially since I’ve been a fan of Banderas since Desperado (1995) and I enjoy his comedic, self-deprecating side quite a bit, I’ve always found it odd that it took me until late 2022 to finally watch 2011’s original solo Puss outing in order to prepare myself for The Last Wish. Amusing an adventure as that was, it’s still not something I’d likely revisit unless one of my kids asks to. So when it came time to watch The Last Wish, to describe my interest as near-zero is the closest to capturing the mood. What I was not prepared for was the mature narrative, a deep and dark look at the repercussions of vainglorious lifestyle as he’s literally hunted by Death in form of the Wolf. I couldn’t, for the life of me, figure out who this film was for — the adults who likely first met Puss in 2004’s Shrek 2 or their children whom might find the whole story a little too much? The mixture of expectation and reaction made for something volatile in my mind, making the film a harder watch as it went along. Yet, the online response has been incredible with critics and general audiences hailing the film’s beauty, its truthfulness, and its daring. My favorite animated films of 2022 include Pompo: The Cinephile, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, The Bob’s Burgers Movie, Unicorn Wars, and Turning Red (among others), so the medium of animation isn’t the issue nor is the exploration of heady topics. With this in mind, and the opportunity for a home release review having come up, I decided to revisit the film with tempered expectations and a grip on the narrative. I can’t say that I would queue this up for fun in the same way that I’ve replayed Pompo, Bob’s, or Turning Red frequently, but in the same way that one might find themselves in the mood for an adult, thoughtful investigation of complex ideas and therefore put on Unicorn Wars, so would I put this on. (Although the inclusion of Harvey Guillén’s sweet Perrito does endear the film just a tad more than even I am willing to admit.) So, with that in mind, I revisited the film with the feature-length commentary from Crawford, Mercado, producer Mark Swift, editor James Ryan, and head of story Heidi Jo Gilbert turned on. Listening to them discuss the process of breaking, shaping, and editing the story is eye-opening. The intention, hinted at with the words “This is a Fairytale” pasted at the start, is for The Last Wish to be a part of the Shrek Universe while also being something all of its own. They also discuss the intentionality of the darkness of the narrative and the application of the visual framework to convey that, using the painting motif to give it a different language from the Shrek films while also making it look like the drawings in a Grimm Fairytales storybook. With the exploration of intentionality, they point out the many times death is a major component of the story, either by placing a skull near Puss (such as in his opening musical number where it’s behind his head) or creating the illusion of one with blocking and set design, by hiding the Wolf out in the open for fast eyes to see, or intentionally using Perrito (he’s such a good boy) and a dog’s often soft, sweet demeanor as the perfect foil to Puss and Kitty Softpaws’s (Salma Hayek Pinault) cat-like independence and selfishness. My favorite thing about home releases is the opportunity to learn about the filmmaking process and the inclusion of feature commentary often feels like a rarity as more home releases include a trailer, perhaps a single brief behind the scenes featurette, and that’s it. Here, however, there’s so much to learn that where someone such as me found the initial watch discordant in seeing how the pieces fit, in learning of the intent, I can finally view the bigger picture and, at the very least, appreciate what is accomplished even if I can recognize that the film as a whole may not be for me.

Perhaps my favorite detail to learn relates to the sequence between the giant and Puss during the opening. As the music blares and the giant attacks, Puss’s movements (and the giant’s) are deliberately staged on beat with the music. I likely wouldn’t have noticed this on my own and it’s mentioned that this is a concept lifted directly from Edgar Wright’s Baby Driver (2017), a film whose entire blocking and choreography is built around the music and score. Details like this are what make commentary tracks so valuable, as they may be the only way that some film fans and cinephiles are able to get to learn about productions. The other bonus features offer their own rewards (looks at the cast at work or offering their thoughts on making the film, three deleted scenes with introductions, an all-cat cam for feline enthusiasts, as well as several artistic projects that may entertain younger fans), but the commentary is where you’ll want to spend your time after an initial watch. There’s so much that they share and this may be the only way to know it. For this review, Universal Pictures Home Entertainment provided a 4K UHD edition that included both a Blu-ray and a digital copy. Be advised that an issue I’ve had with other digital editions is present here when viewing bonus features through iTunes: all audio and no video. This occurred with several of the “A Cast of Characters” featurettes, the new short The Trident, “Jack Horner’s Line-O-Rama,” and a few others. When I tried to access them via the 4k UHD disc, there was no issue. Another lovely thing about the home release, the bonus features aren’t limited to one disc format. Often with combo packs, the bonus features may be on the Blu-ray only or somehow lock materials to digital or physical-only. That doesn’t appear to be the case here as you can access any and all no matter the format you prefer. Of course, I can’t speak to the DVD edition as that wasn’t included, so keep that in mind. As expected, though, the 4K UHD looks great with this release. I may not fully grasp the intention of using the style beyond “let’s make it look different because we’re telling a pseudo-outside the Shrek Universe story,” but I can’t argue with the at-home representation. Especially in the initial scene with the Wolf and the clown car of characters at the fallen star, the 4K UHD with HDR provides the kind of depth of field and appropriate shading of colors that make one feel that they’re watching something unique.

All Rights Reserved. I’m of the mind that not all films need to be “for me” to appreciate them. I like the overall concepts of The Last Wish more than I do the execution, but that seems to hinge more on how I feel about Puss specifically. If you were one of *many* who made repeat trips to the theater, who has discussed and analyzed everything from the initial musical number to the perfectly executed panic attack scene, who has sought after a stuffed Perrito toy because we know Universal has them: then snagging The Last Wish is an absolute forgone conclusion. For those like me who may need something more than being a completist and making sure you have all the Shrek movies under one roof, the bonus features are where it’s at.",POSITIVE
"Mar 5, 2023"," THE BOXTROLLS (2014) / KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS (2016). With Coraline and ParaNorman both hitting 4K this past December, Laika’s other stop-motion wonders are now joining them in the format. Adapted from Alan Snow’s novel Here Be Monsters!, The Boxtrolls starts off employing a familiar and oft-used formula — i.e. the story of a young boy in the midst of various critters (everything from The Jungle Book to Where the Wild Things Are) — before eventually hitting its own unique stride. The title creatures are harmless trolls who are nevertheless feared by the citizens of the town of Cheesebridge. Wanting to be accepted by the ruling elite, the scurvy Archibald Snatcher (voiced by Ben Kingsley) promises to exterminate the meek monsters, a task that meets resistance in “Eggs” (Isaac Hempstead Wright), a boy who was raised by the Boxtrolls. Elle Fanning, sister of Coraline star Dakota Fanning, voices a girl who aids Eggs in his task, while Nick Frost, Richard Ayoade, and Tracy Morgan pipe up as Snatcher’s underlings. The final bit that seeps into the end credits — a philosophical discussion between Frost’s Mr. Trout and Ayoade’s Mr. Pickles — is a marvelously meta moment. Like Coraline, ParaNorman, and The Boxtrolls before it, Kubo and the Two Strings also nabbed an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, and then did them all one better by also becoming only the second animated film (after The Nightmare Before Christmas) to compete in the Best Visual Effects category. Certainly, it’s a visually striking picture, drawing much of its style from various Japanese modes of artistic expression, both ancient (origami) and modern (Miyazaki). Kubo (voiced by Art Parkinson) is a young boy who embarks on a journey to find the armor of the father he never knew. Accompanying him on his odyssey are an anthropomorphic monkey (Charlize Theron), a beetle warrior (Matthew McConaughey) with amnesia, and an origami samurai; standing in their way are insidious entities known as The Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) and The Sisters (Rooney Mara). This is the only Laika production where the length is felt, but even an occasional lull doesn’t dent the picture’s startling design and mystical aura. Each two-disc steelbook set (sold separately) offers the film on a 4K UHD disc and the special features on a Blu-ray. Extras are similar in nature, as each includes audio commentary (by co-directors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi on The Boxtrolls, and director-producer Travis Knight on Kubo and the Two Strings); rare test footage; a piece on the puppets; feature-length storyboards; and photo galleries. DEVOTION (2022). Jonathan Majors has already been making a name for himself both on television (Lovecraft Country, Loki) and in film (The Last Black Man in San Francisco, Da 5 Bloods), but 2023 seems to be the year that he’s truly breaking out, thanks to his acclaimed performances as the antagonists in Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania and Creed III. Slipping between the cracks of all these high-profile projects was Devotion, a $90 million naval aviation flick that crashed and burned with a $20 million gross. In the year of the thrill-a-minute Top Gun: Maverick, it’s easy to see how something so languorous would keep the masses away, but the truth is that this plodding and underdeveloped picture would register as a noble failure at any time. Centering on real-life figures who served as officers during the Korean War, this stars Majors as Jesse Brown, the first black aviator in Navy history, and Glen Powell as Tom Hudner, his best friend and wingman. For a film meant to inspire and invigorate, Devotion is an awfully timid endeavor, and the script (based on Adam Makos’ book Devotion: An Epic Story of Heroism, Friendship, and Sacrifice) is respectful to a fault, taking a muted, Masterpiece Theatre approach to a full-blooded tale whose messier elements included the racism that Brown had to confront on a regular basis. Powell, so dynamic in Top Gun: Maverick, is largely ineffectual here, and we never feel the supposed depths of the friendship that existed between his Hudner and Majors’ Brown. MARATHON MAN (1976). A powerhouse cast brings steely conviction to this atmospheric thriller efficiently directed by Midnight Cowboy helmer John Schlesinger and penned by William Goldman (adapting his own novel). Dustin Hoffman is excellent (if a tad too old) as “Babe” Levy, a graduate student and hardcore runner who doesn’t know that his older brother “Doc” (a superb Roy Scheider) is a government agent, and one who’s presently involved in dealings with Nazi war criminal Christian Szell (Laurence Olivier). Convinced that Babe knows the whereabouts of a stash of diamonds he himself had taken from executed Jews during WWII, Szell uses his knowledge of dentistry to torture the clueless Babe (leading to the film’s classic line, “Is it safe?”) and force the college student to employ his marathon training to extract himself from a harrowing situation. Tricky in its plot structure, the movie cannily plops a complete innocent in the midst of people who are smarter, stronger, and savvier and then requires him to outlast them all in order to survive. Only the climactic doubleheader (a confrontation in a desolate house and a scuffle in a Central Park maintenance facility) disappoints. For his chilling performance as a Nazi, Olivier earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination; two years later, he would nab a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his hammy performance as a Nazi hunter in The Boys from Brazil. Goldman, meanwhile, deservedly won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar for his other 1976 credit, All the President’s Men. PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH (2022). Even though Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots owned the Shrek franchise from the moment he was introduced in the second film, that was no reason to hand him his own film. Or at least that was my thinking upon the 2011 release of Puss in Boots, a toon flick I found listless and lackluster. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, turning up 11 years after its predecessor, is a laudable vehicle for the energetic and egocentric feline. Frequently forsaking the snarky and occasionally tiresome brand of humor that defined the Shrek crop and carried over into the first PiB, this one does a fine job of balancing its knockabout humor with a surprisingly somber tale of how the specter of death can limit one’s ability to fully embrace and enjoy life. Having used up eight of his nine lives, Puss perpetually tries to stay a step ahead of Death (personified as a sickle-wielding wolf and  voiced by Wagner Moura), and he’s joined by former partner Kitty Softpaws (returning Salma Hayek Pinault) and a scruffy dog (Harvey Guillén) as he attempts to find the Wishing Star and regain all of his lives. Yet he’s not the only one seeking the Star, with his nemeses including Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Jack Horner (John Mulaney). An Oscar nominee for Best Animated Feature Film, this may not be as original or innovative as fellow contenders (and front-runners) Marcel the Shell With Shoes On and Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio, but darn if it didn’t move me the most. TRAINING DAY (2001). Despite formidable performances in the likes of Malcolm X and Fences, Denzel Washington’s only Best Actor Oscar to date (he earlier had won a supporting statue for 1989’s Glory) was for this gritty and initially engrossing cop flick. Washington is riveting as Alonzo Harris, an LA narcotics officer who gives rookie Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke, nabbing a Best Supporting Actor nomination) one day to see if he has what it takes to work under his command. Jake is thrilled with the opportunity, but he soon realizes that Alonzo’s methods, which usually involve bending or breaking the law, fly in the face of his own idealism. The role of Alonzo Harris would allow any actor ample opportunities to chew the scenery, but Washington repeatedly refuses the bait — his performance is all live-wire mobility and coiled intensity. There’s also a delicious ambiguity in David Ayer’s screenplay that suggests Alonzo’s dirty deeds might be the only way for a cop to survive on the streets. Unfortunately, all philosophical musings about the moral dilemma in committing evil for the sake of goodness are washed away in the third act, as the movie sheds all lofty ambitions and becomes a police shoot-’em-up marked by contrived circumstances and convenient coincidences. Extras in the 4K + Blu-ray + Digital Code edition include audio commentary by director Antoine Fuqua; deleted scenes; an alternate ending; and music videos for Pharoahe Monch’s “Got You” and Nelly’s “#1.” Turkey Pick: METEOR (1979). The 1979 flop Beyond the Poseidon Adventure was covered in this slot last week; now here’s another of the expensive bombs that helped kill off the disaster flick at decade’s end. An asteroid five miles wide is headed straight for Earth, and if it hits, it’s the end of the world as we know it. A NASA bigwig (Karl Malden) taps a former colleague (Sean Connery) to help find a solution, but it soon becomes clear that progress will only be made if the U.S. pools its resources with those of the U.S.S.R. Yet even as the NASA brains feverishly work alongside a Russian scientist (Brian Keith) and his translator (Natalie Wood), smaller meteor chunks are already pelting the earth, causing mass destruction in New York, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. Meteor isn’t as cheesy as some of the other entries in the disaster cycle, but it’s also not much fun, with reams of dry dialogue, visual effects that run hot and cold, and slumming movie stars trying their damnedest to stay awake. Still, you do get to hear Connery ask government bigwigs forcing him to help out, “Why don’t you also stick a broom up my ass so I can sweep the floor on the way out?” The cast also includes Martin Landau (in the hammy portion of his otherwise stellar career; see also 1980’s Without Warning and 1982’s Alone in the Dark) as a Russkie-hating officer, cult favorite Sybil Danning as a skier who gets buried under a mountain of Styrofoam — excuse me, snow — and “Henry Fonda as The President.” The film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Sound, presumably for the whooshing noise the space rock makes as it hurtles toward our planet.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2023"," It has been over 11 years since our favourite cat in footwear swashbuckled his way through a big screen animated adventure, and now the man, the myth, the moggy returns to action… but is Puss’ latest daring tale truly worthy of our fluffy hero? The Last Wish catches up with our cream-lapping hero Puss (Antonio Banderas), as he reaches a scary realisation that he has used up eight of his nine lives. However, in this last life, he faces a dark threat that is calling for him. To escape his fate, Puss goes on a daring adventure to a mystical land to find the magical wishing star and have his wish for replenished lives granted. But he isn’t the only one who hopes to be wishing upon a star! Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a dazzling, creative triumph that shares many outstanding qualities with Gore Verbinski’s Rango. The Last Wish is not just an improvement on Puss’ first fun solo outing way back in 2011; it’s a mesmerising sequel that re-energises the Shrek-verse and ends with a tantalising tease. This film repositions DreamWorks firmly back into the conversation for the first time in years when it comes to the best major studio in mainstream animated filmmaking. Last year, they delivered an early winner with The Bad Guys, and this year they have repeated that remarkable feat and then some with a film that is already a strong contender for the year’s best animated feature. The whizz-popping wish-chasing story is fantastical groundwork for a far deeper and richer journey into the quality of life, finding the value in what has always been in front of you, grappling with mortality, and living with anxiety. There are so many carefully crafted textures to Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay, as director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado, let the film run free, unleashing a funny, poignant and exciting torrent of imagination, sword-swinging action, and meaningfully layered family entertainment. It really is the cat’s whiskers. Taking in an array of influences from anime to Zorro, and some other surprising genres, the film’s CG-meets-painted animation style is absolutely gorgeous. It provides a visual accompaniment that is just as impressive as the story, along with Heitor Pereira’s culturally explosive score. The screen is just full to bursting with ideas, emotion and lovable characters and is utterly impossible not to fall in love with Harvey Guillén’s ever hopeful Perrito the dog. He accompanies Puss on his journey, and is a heartwarmer and heartbreaker in equal measure, while Banderas’ ever-brilliant work as Puss expands the character in many breathtaking ways and Salma Hayek Pinault’s return as Puss’ former friend/flame Kitty Softpaws offers further unexpected narrative heft. Meanwhile, some of the newer characters (many who’re deliriously entertaining spins on classic fairy tales and nursery rhymes) are a joy, from John Mulaney’s memorably irredeemable ‘Big’ Jack Horner to Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo’s criminal gang take on Goldilocks and the three bears. Additionally, DreamWorks unleashes arguably its greatest ever villain (at least since Gary Oldman’s Lord Shen) in Wagner Moura’s genuinely terrifying, red-eyed, sickle-spinning Wolf, whom has an air of Tim Curry menace about him and steals every scene he is in. The Last Wish is a spellbinding, funny, and gorgeous piece of animated storytelling that restores this franchise to past glory. The real cat in the hat is back, and his boots are very much made for walking! Me-wow!",POSITIVE
"Feb 22, 2023"," DreamWorks Animation succeeded in building its brand through the initial popularity of the Shrek franchise. While the entirety of the Shrek Cinematic Universe has earned the accolades of its first two entries, its most famous feline character's spin-off series has landed chiefly on its feet. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, with Antonio Banderas's signature rasp behind the swashbuckling orange tabby, has amplified the re-imagining of fairy tales through a grittier, visually stunning, and grounded narrative.  The sequel to Puss in Boots is brimming with vibrancy and life. Its rich creativity has been scarce in 2022's animation slate, and even if the story's resolution may feel fairly predictable, the charming nature of the central journey and the simple-yet-effective message hammers morality into the film's purpose. While it's not surprising that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish treads into more adult conflicts, it was unexpected that one of the best metaphors for death in animation would be found in Wagner Mourna's chilling Wolf. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish echoes the sentiment that we are to make the most of the one life we're given, but not to take it too seriously.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes necessary risks without losing subscribing to the assumption that all sequels lose their luster. 8.5/10. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2023"," For her directorial debut, Michelle Garza Cervera decided she wasn’t going to play it safe. Instead, she presents a chilling dissection of the tribulations of pregnancy following a woman settling into a domestic life having grown up fighting against that very idea. Having prayed to a statue of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Valeria (Solián) and her husband Raúl (Dosal) receive the outcome they desire as their lives are about to be blessed with a newborn baby. However, the following months for Valeria are plagued by sneering family members, a loss of profession, a husband who fears sex in case it harms their baby, a desire for her old partner, and, oh, a malevolent entity that wishes to possess her. In short, she’s had better times. Huesera portrays a slow-burning, subtle horror that has an alarming intimacy, it's far more focused on Valeria’s struggles against a culture that expects her, as a woman, to submit to motherhood than with traditional horror - but there’s enough of that throughout also. She spends her pregnancy trying to live up to what others want when its apparent she isn’t clear on what she wants, and these moments provide plenty of discomfort alongside scenes of a menacing presence that lurks in the shadows and torments Valeria at every given opportunity (this entity is based on actual Mexican folklore). Cervera shows plenty of flair in her direction and the combined cinematography and sound design are especially impressive - at times, the sound literally crackles throughout as sequences of silence are shattered by the sickening crunch of bones. As Valeria spirals further physically and mentally, the movie veers more into conventional horror as the third act begins leading to a visually striking and satisfying conclusion, but, crucially, the movie isn’t upended or disjointed tonally by this shift. With a super lead performance from Natalie Solián (in her feature debut), sharp writing, and a combination of sequences that get under your skin, Huesera is a triumphant debut offering. The pace and overall lack of ‘scares’ may not be to everyone's tastes, and, at times, it does feel sluggish, but Huesera delivers a powerful, engaging, and sometimes bruising experience. The Australian film scene is one that consistently delivers strong productions that often fall below the radar, and their horror scene has, in the past, delivered some excellent entries into the genre. With Surrogate, debutant director David Willing opts to foray into the supernatural with a story focusing on Natalie (Morassi),  a single mother and nurse who, after aiding a sick woman late at night, falls mysteriously ill. This illness results in immediate symptoms of pregnancy that quickly culminates in an apparent birth, though the baby is nowhere to be found. With the ire of doctors and child services raised, and her physical and mental well-being on a rapid downward spiral, Natalie must do everything within in her power to keep her family and herself from falling apart. Whilst not wholly original - the film does lean heavily on its influences - Surrogate is an effective and sometimes excellent low-budget horror movie that blends supernatural elements with mystery and thriller aspects. Anchored by a strong lead performance from Kestie Morassi, there’s a confidence that flows through Surrogate which is a testament to Willing and co-writer Beth King, and its competent production blends well with Mark Buys’ score. At times, the movie can feel solid if unspectacular but sprinkled throughout are some genuinely excellent sequences - a seance midway through the movie is perfectly framed and executed to deliver a deliciously atmospheric and tense situation - and the conclusion was unexpectedly bleak and striking, its an ending that really props the movie up satisfyingly. With the varying subplots, characters, and genre crossovers, the movie does sometimes threaten to derail itself, and whilst not every aspect is a success, at no point do the wheels fall off entirely. Surrogate is an assured debut feature that attempts to blend the old and new, and, more often than not, succeeds in doing so. The time of Kang is now. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is both the 31st movie in the ever-lingering Marvel Cinematic Universe and the feature debut of Jonathan Major’s Kang the Conqueror - described as the next Thanos-level villain for our Avengers heroes. Peyton Reed returns to helm the third eusocial-themed blockbuster as Paul Rudd’s Scott Lang, along with his daughter Cassie (Newton), the Wasp (Lilly), Hank Pym (Douglas), and Janet van Dyne (Pfeiffer), explore the mysterious Quantum Realm, and, in doing so, threaten to unleash a force that could take over the universe. How they get there is a bit ridiculous, as is the rest of the movie sadly. Quantumania is a disjointed, messy, and, frankly bland movie that basically serves as a setup for the next batch of MCU movies at the expense of…being an Ant-Man movie. Quantumania starts off feeling like an Ant-Man flick and it’s as breezy and fun as you’d expect, but once the Quantum Realm is introduced, everything begins to fall apart narratively. The need to move things along to introduce Kang and his backstory, at the expense of the story, is plainly obvious alongside some tedious foreshadowing of “HIM”, “HE” and “SOMEONE” - Michelle Pfeiffer is asked to lazily spend half the movie not telling her family information which would be deemed as crucial to their plight. Thankfully, Jonathan Majors saves the movie with his strong and menacing performance as Kang, each scene he is in is elevated to the point that the rest of the movie seems vanilla by comparison. That’s not to say Paul Rudd isn’t his usual charming self, he is and he’s doing what he does best here, but the rest of the cast…aren’t great - I assumed throughout that Michael Douglas had quit acting whilst filming this. The cast has to work with what they are given so that should be taken into consideration, but their characters end up becoming lost in the sheer glob of colour and sometimes toe-curling VFX. I’m fully aware that the Quantum Realm needs to be realised somehow but, even for a multiverse setting, it felt too much here, especially with the StageCraft usage that stuck out badly. The art department was afforded licence to have fun with their designs though with an abundance of aliens and funky background characters, even if it did feel a bit Star Wars-y at times, and this element allowed for some ace character designs to distract from the visuals, shallow script, and uninspired gags - though MODOK was, well, awful. As someone who dug the first two Ant-Man movies, this feels like a step back for the character in service of the now standard-MCU setups which is a shame. We get Kang, which is great, but it’s hard not to wish that he could have been introduced in a better movie. After an encouraging start, Quantumania succumbs to mediocrity when it had the chance to propel the MCU forward effectively. Jonathan Majors is great, but the movie is anything but. Oh, and Bill Murray appears for some reason. Everyone’s favourite swashbuckling feline is back in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish…but for how long? You see, Puss (Banderas) has long neglected the value of his nine lives and is now down to his final one. After a brush with a villainous Wolf (Moura) causes him to retire to a cat home, Puss is quickly drawn back into the fight when the chance to wish his lives back into existence rears its head - but he’s not the only one trying to reach the mythical Last Wish. 2011’s Puss in Boots was well received as a spin-off to the Shrek franchise but a sequel after twelve years seemed like an odd choice, specifically, where has the interest come from to suddenly release a sequel now? Well, I’m glad that Dreamworks decided to push forward as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is wonderful. A movie about a marauding cat delivering some genuinely poignant themes of friendship, selflessness, mental health, and mortality was not on my bingo card this year but here it is. The movie offers some deliciously realised animated action set pieces, good comedy, unsurprisingly strong voice acting from Banderas and Hayek (plus a slew of newcomers including Florence Pugh and Harvey Guillén’s cutesy Perrito) and one of the better villains I have seen in years - Wagner Moura’s Wolf had such a sinister presence that never let up, his menacing smile and whistle was a real sign that it was about to hit the fan. Similarly, the movie follows suit in that it doesn’t condescend to the audience in delivering its narrative and messages which is something that cannot be levied at other animated movies in recent years (also, at one point, a dude has his skin sucked right from his skeleton..). Crucially, whilst the story does sag somewhat at the midway point, there’s more than enough on offer throughout to keep audiences of all ages engaged and engrossed in the adventure. Emotional and surprisingly excellent, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of Dreamworks' best and a real crowd-pleaser. When you see the surname ‘Cronenberg’ attached to anything, you should know that you’re in for a wild ride. The poster alone for Brandon Cronenberg’s latest effort Infinity Pool is odd enough, Alexander Skarsgård submerged in a red goo as Mia Goth looks on seductively/menacingly beside him - that would explain the ‘Pool’ of it all. The story centres on struggling author James Foster (Skarsgård) and his wife Em (Coleman), who, whilst, vacationing at a luxury resort on the reclusive island of Li Tolqa, meet Gabi (Goth) and Alban (Lespert). Whilst all initially seems pleasant, an incident outside of the resort (all guests are explicitly told not to leave the resort) involving both couples sends the Foster’s relationship into turmoil and James spiralling into an abyss of excess, depravity, and lust having witnessed…something…that initially repulsed him before becoming fully seduced by the idea. If you couldn’t tell, I am attempting to keep things as vague as possible so as not to drop spoilers for what is a fever dream packed with sex, orgies, urine, dark humour, and violence - it’s a lot. However, Infinity Pool feels focused narratively and in its direction - this feels like a step up from Cronenberg Jr’s previous movie Possessor - with its themes of depersonalization, hedonism, and the rich indulging their unkempt desires (money is the root of all evil, and all that). Skarsgård delivers a fine performance as he walks the lines between fear, anxiety, rage, lust, and acceptance and Goth provides yet another example of her exceptional talents (she again plays a scarily-genuine feeling psychopath), their interplay between them is fascinating to watch. The movie as a whole may not be fascinating for everyone to watch as it depicts graphic sexual scenes, drug usage, full frontal nudity, and blunt violence - it's not the heaviest movie I’ve ever seen but it may prove to be too challenging for some. Infinity Pool comes out of the gate fast with a strong first half before settling into a satisfyingly solid second half, though I never felt any real lulls throughout. The intrigue is enticing and there is enough black comedy to ensure proceedings don’t become too wild - there’s a real maturity to the storytelling here and provides another interesting addition to Brandon’s burgeoning filmography. Cocaine. Bear. The two words that have come to define cinema. This is cinema. This is Cocaine Bear. Right, enough silliness, I’ll leave that for the movie itself. Having taken the internet by storm simply due to its title and premise - that being, a bear feasted on a large amount of ditched cocaine in 1985 - could Elizabeth Banks’ latest directorial effort live up to the hype? Kind of. If you’re going into the movie expecting to see a coked up bear going on a rampage, then you’ll find yourself in luck but…bear…in mind that a hefty chunk of the ninety-five minute runtime is gifted to a host of human characters, most of whom aren’t particularly interesting. Now, this being called a true story comes with the notion that you take that with a pinch of salt, a major amount of liberties have been taken here, but, without those liberties, this would be a very boring movie. Did the real cocaine bear massacre a rabble of misfits? No. But why let the truth get in the way of a drug-fuelled story. At no point does the movie lose sight of what it is though, this is self-aware comedy horror and everyone here is game for the mission - O’ Shea Jackson Jr. and Alden Ehrenreich are both having a blast, as is Margo Martindale, and Keri Russell is dependably solid in her role as Sari, mother of young teen Dee Dee (Prince) who is taken by the bear when she and her friend Henry (Convery) ditch school for a days adventure in the national park. The issue is that the characters themselves don’t really have a lot to them other than their gimmick, and as the movie doesn’t lean in hard enough to each of them, they feel undercooked and underserved. Similarly, whilst the bear brings nothing but terror, the nagging sense that this could have gone harder or wilder never left me. It’s bloody, for sure, and there are some great gags, but I left my viewing feeling like the movie would have been more…fun. Had Banks trimmed some of the unnecessary subplots - including a sweet but unnecessary one about a dog - then the movie would have felt that bit tighter and allowed for more focus on the bear and the humans fighting for survival. For what it is, essentially a jacked up B-movie, Cocaine Bear is still a fun enough ride, however, for a movie called Cocaine Bear, to be left with the feeling that this was not crazy enough is, well...crazy.",POSITIVE
"Feb 14, 2023"," “Do you find me disgusting?” asks Charlie (Brendan Fraser), who weighs 42st and spends most of his time beached on a sofa, scarfing down meatball subs and pizza. Sometimes he teaches an online literature course — on Moby-Dick, naturally — telling his students his webcam is broken so they won’t be alarmed by his obesity. Other times he masturbates to gay porn.

The latter takes the form of a sinister, sickle-twirling wolf with his own spaghetti western theme tune, and there’s even a touch of Bergman in his existential exchanges with the “stabby tabby”.",POSITIVE

"Feb 9, 2023"," Puss in Boots faces an existential crisis in this riotously fun, Oscar-nominated sequel from DreamWorks. Having recklessly used up eight of his nine lives, the fearless feline is forced to accept that his roistering days are over - unless he can restore his vitality by wishing on a star. However, he's not alone in his search for the mythical land where it can be found, and so begins a race for the prize. As voiced by Antonio Banderas, Puss oozes charm from every paw, with his new-found vulnerability making his character all the more endearing. Among the rest of the fairy-tale supporting cast, Goldilocks and the Three Bears get a coarse, cor-blimey makeover courtesy of Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Samson Kayo and (naturally) Ray Winstone, while John Mulaney bags all the best lines as a truly monstrous Jack Horner. The animation particularly comes alive during the anime-styled action scenes, while the sharp script delivers gags galore and pleasing nods to The Wizard of Oz, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and the wider Shrek-verse. Coming 11 years after the original Puss in Boots film, The Last Wish proves a sensational, swashbuckling return for everyone's favourite costumed cat.",POSITIVE

"Feb 8, 2023"," Expectations can derail a movie. There are times when you can enter a theater without them, but it’s harder than you think. A sequel doubles down on this theory. A sequel to a beloved movie is essentially going ALL IN from the jump. “Knives Out” was a spectacular hit because of a whodunit concept crafted to perfection, and a very good cast, led by Daniel Craig. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Ana de Armas, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, and Chris Evans played fine parts in the mystery. Stacked cast, a dry wit sense of humor, and Rian Johnson unplugging after pissing in the cheerios of “Star Wars” fans. It was a beautiful, perfectly paced dark comedy thriller. Plummer’s rich novelist dies, leaving behind a mystery for his greedy family to unfold and solve–one designed by the departed soul. “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery” takes that setup and spins it a bit. It’s Edward Norton’s uber rich Elon Musk-type dipshit who invites all of his oldest friends to solve his murder mystery. Craig’s famous Benoit Blanc also attends, bringing along his amazing slow-burn detective instincts to the fray of greed. Katie Hudson, Dave Bautista, Janelle Monae, and Kathryn Hahn sub in here for the intrigued party members who get to play a real life game of “C.L.U.E.” The concept of that game is sewn into Johnson’s films, and that gets you through the first half of the movie. But this sequel lacks the overall spark of the original. Losing some speed on the fastball is standard practice for this arena, but I left the film satisfied with what was received. However, I wasn’t jumping out of his pants wanting to talk about it, hence the three week wait until this review. What gets set up and revealed midway is ingenious. What follows afterwards is the softball part of the equation. Craig and Monae have the most fun and give easily the best performances. When they’re together on screen, it’s as if they are aloof to the rest of the movie and cast. Norton can’t give a bad performance, but he recycles his asshat from “The Italian Job” here, and it’s not as appealing. The rest of the cast goes through the motions of film personas they created before this movie. At times, I was very entertained. Other times, I wanted more out of what I was watching. Expectations can do that to a film, for better or worse. I’ll give “Glass Onion” a 2/4 rating. The world wasn’t exactly screaming for a sequel to “Puss in Boots.” Granted, the furry little fella stole a good chunk of the “Shrek” film, and the solo film made $555 million while scoring an 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Eleven years after the 2011 film, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” attempts the impossible: hitting the net on your third trip through the order. Overall, “The Last Wish” is a success. Coming in at a brisk 100 minutes and carrying enough pop culture humor to fill two movies, this sequel gives you the goods. It’s a ticket to the Antonio Banderas show. He puts in wonderful voice work, infusing the animated sword-savvy feline with charisma and passion. It’s not one of those “phone it in” voice performances; you can really tell Banderas loves this character. The story revolves around Puss running out of eight of his nine lives, finding himself on the run feuding off attackers. Along the way, he teams up with Kitty Softpaws (the lovely Selma Hayek) to help stretch out the clock. A supporting cast of Florence Pugh (pugh-pugh), Olivia Colman, Harvey Guillen, and John Mulaney doesn’t hurt at all. I would slot this in as a movie that keeps the adult’s attention while giving the kids a good eye candy session. It’s impossible not to root for Puss to run the gauntlet and get the girl, even if watching him sweat (and adjust facial hair on the fly) is a fun time. Let’s go 3/4 for PUSSSSSS IN BOOTS… 2! If I had to choose between the two, I would punch your pass to Puss and leave the onion in the kitchen. I’m more of a donut hole guy anyway. Since it’s Christmas Eve, I want to say one more thing. First, hey Meme. No, it’s not pronounced how you think. Before words on a picture went viral, young Lebanese boys called their grandmothers “Meme,” or May-May. She was a tiny ball of fire. Henrietta Bulus mastered at least five languages, spoke with Mother Teresa, threw more dinner parties than anyone on Blue Jay Cove, and loved her grandsons more than life itself. A lady who weighed less than 100 pounds could grab your forearm, and give you the impression that a bodybuilder was sitting next to you. She outwalked people half her age, and lived a long life. It just wasn’t long enough. Pardon me, but I am greedy when it comes to great family members. Meme passed away eleven years ago today, succumbing to an injury she suffered about two weeks earlier. Meme passed away on the same day, Christmas Eve, that she was married on to my late grandfather, Lawrence. It’s Larry who supplied me with my middle name, and most likely the writing gene. Pepe left us in 1989. Meme passed in 2011, around six weeks after the St. Louis Cardinals won the World Series. A cruel yet bittersweet reminder that life can supply you with the most incredible people, but they won’t be here forever. Movies, thankfully, will be. Have some fun with the next one you choose. If it happens to be a French film, think of my Meme when watching it.",POSITIVE
"Feb 7, 2023"," Kids will get a kick out of the sprightly and silly Puss in Boots: The Last Wish – but really, this one is for the millennials. Antonio Banderas’s pint-sized feline rogue, with his thigh-high boots and eyes as big as saucers, became an instant hit when he was introduced in 2004’s Shrek 2. But his follow-up appearances, in the later Shrek sequels and a 2011 spin-off, have played as either wrung out or purely cynical. The Last Wish offers something different and unexpected: Puss has grown up with his audience. He is now, in exquisitely millennial fashion, suffering from feline burnout. Having already torn through eight of his nine lives (reminder to never go running with the bulls in Pamplona if you’re 15in tall), Puss must now face his mortality. And so, he slinks into his crisis era, complete with a sizable beard and an unshakeable malaise. His end-of-life stupor is interrupted, however, by Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo). The Cockney-accented bandits are searching for the fabled Wishing Star, which can grant one person their heart’s desire. Puss’s love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) makes her return to the franchise while John Mulaney plays Little Jack Horner, with his thumb in all the pies, as a washed-up child star. But the heart of the film, thanks to a standout performance from What We Do in the Shadows’s Harvey Guillén, is a squeaky-voiced, pot-bellied mutt without a home or a name (Puss comes to call him Perrito, aka “little dog”). Children will fall in love with Perrito. He is, after all, an adorable tiny puppy. But it’s the adults who will blub as Perrito teaches his world-weary companions not to let the cruelty of life bog them down. Dreamworks has increasingly explored these more mature themes – which isn’t to say The Last Wish has abandoned the kind of irreverent parody that first made Shrek the ideal antidote for Disney's saccharine princess tales. There is, for example, a particularly ingenious take on Pinocchio’s Jiminy Cricket, who now sounds like James Stewart owing to the voicework of story supervisor Kevin McCann. Using the same blend of 2D and 3D animation popularised by Sony’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018), Dreamworks continues to push the boundaries of mainstream animation. The Last Wish is visually gorgeous with an attention to detail you might not expect given it’s a sequel to a spin-off of a two-decade-old film. Goldilocks’s skirt is astonishing, a quilt-like ruckus of fabrics. The animation even faithfully captures the individual nuances of its A-list cast – especially Banderas and Hayek Pinault, who easily slip into the flirtatious dynamic of their characters in Robert Rodriguez’s Nineties El Mariachi trilogy. Sure, the kids won’t get that reference but it's just one of many delights that The Last Wish has to offer its more millennial-aged audience.",POSITIVE
"Feb 6, 2023"," The Shrek universe expands a little more with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, another computer-animated family film from DreamWorks, with Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinnault reprising their roles as Puss and his frenemy Kitty Softclaws. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado serve up a treat, one worthy of its Oscar nod for best animated feature. As with all the Shrek Cinematic Universe output, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish subverts fairytales and nursery rhymes while telling its story, and part of the fun is seeing which the writers Paul Fisher, Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler plunder and then reimagine for modern audiences. Some references are simply to make a gag (the movie is stuffed full of them), while others make a nod to serious points such as the importance of loyalty or how ageing and death are realities of life. The story centres on Puss, who with horror realises that he is on the last of his nine lives and, using a map filled with riddles, has to find a wishing star to restore them. But before he can reach it he is stalked by death, here given the form of a big, bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). Also involved in Puss's adventure are Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) – reimagined as a cockney crime family – and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), as an immensely greedy hoarder of all things magical which might help the assorted cast get to the wishing star before Puss does. It's a clever conceit. The film starts with a lengthy sequence in which our hero performs yet more acts of derring do in defeating a giant and is everyone's hero. Then, because he's a player, he parties till dawn – keep that full-cream milk coming – but realises time is catching up with him. His journey begins to find the wishing star, but of course he faces any number of obstacles – with the Wolf stalking his every move. Along the way Puss teams up with former paramour Kitty Softpaws (cue some outrageous feline flirting), and Perrito (Harvey Guillén), an adorable runt of the litter who attaches himself to the two cats whether they want him to or not. His naivety is touching – he thinks being thrown in a rubbish bin was his family's version of hide and seek – but Perrito turns out to be strong and brave when Puss needs him most, one of the many life lessons subtly parlayed in this film. The animation style is warm and uses high colour, the film's visual richness giving the impression almost that we're stepping into a picture book. It's very appealing.",POSITIVE
"Feb 6, 2023"," This Shrek spin-off is a breezily entertaining DreamWorks animation that harnesses the familiar appeal of the self-aggrandising feline (Antonio Banderas), while also adopting a distinctive and original graphic visual style. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado both worked on the Kung Fu Panda films, and it’s perhaps this, plus the striking stylised action sequences of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, that informs the bold, peppy approach to Puss’s gravity-defying derring-do. The plot is basic: down to his final life, Puss sees an opportunity to restore the full nine with a magic wishing star. He’s not the only one seeking it: Goldilocks and her ursine crime syndicate are on his trail, as is the monstrous “Big” Jack Horner. And then there’s Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and wannabe emotional support animal Perrito the chihuahua (Harvey Guillén). It helps that the writing is as sharp as Puss’s claws.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2023"," There's nothing funny about morbid obesity, yet its depiction on screen is usually in the service of comedy — Terry Jones as Mr Creosote in Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life (1983) lumbers unavoidably to mind. Hugely fat characters also populate horror and fantasy films, but it's not often that you find one as the protagonist in a love story. Admittedly, Darren Aronofsky's The Whale isn't a conventional love story — it isn't a conventional anything — but it's about love nonetheless, both destructive and redemptive. Charlie (Brendan Fraser) weighs over 40 st and is not just housebound but practically chairbound. He is a middle-aged academic who teaches creative writing online from his apartment somewhere in Idaho, but is so crippled by his colossal size that he cannot get to the front door without a walking-frame. He picks things up from the floor with a grabber contraption like the ones children aim at furry pink rabbits in amusement arcades, and is sufficiently self-conscious about his appearance that when he teaches, he pretends that the camera on his laptop is broken. He can be heard over Zoom, but not seen. We enter Charlie's life with, it appears, very little of it to go. His fierce but devoted carer, Liz (Hong Chau), tells him that congestive heart failure will soon see him off, that he needs urgent hospital treatment to have any chance of survival. But Charlie doesn't want to pay expensive medical bills, not least because he has no wish to survive. When he does think his death is imminent, he rather oddly begs a visiting missionary (Ty Simpkins) to read him extracts from an essay about Moby Dick. The reason for this will emerge, but in the meantime Charlie is eating himself into an early grave with a daily intake of pizzas and sandwiches that would feed a hungry family of six. He wasn't always so fat, but the suicide of his male lover — for whom he had left his wife, Mary (Samantha Morton), and daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink) — triggered a spectacular binge-eating habit that he is neither able nor willing to control. Charlie's psychological demons become clearer when 17-year-old Ellie comes to see him for the first time in eight years. She is charmless at best, at worst vicious and manipulative, but Charlie, even though he has to bribe her to continue calling on him, sees only the good in her. Indeed, it is perhaps the chief irony in Darren Aronofsky's bold drama that Charlie has a generous, almost childlike view of humanity in general that he cannot apply to himself. I was no fan of Aronofsky's last film, the ghastly, voyeuristic Mother! (2017). But he is certainly anything but anodyne as a director, and The Whale — adapted by Samuel D. Hunter from his own 2012 play — deserves all the attention it will continue to have up to Academy Awards night next month. In many respects it is another exercise in audience voyeurism (you have been warned), and from where I was sitting, its intrinsic theatricality diminishes its value as a film. Apart from a couple of fleeting flashbacks, we don't move beyond the confines of his home any more than sweet, self-loathing Charlie does. But, with a nod for whoever looked after the fat suit and prosthetics, Fraser's performance is genuinely stupendous. He is the favourite to win Best Actor at the Oscars, and I can understand why. It's less easy to understand why M. Night Shyamalan thought Knock At The Cabin — an adaptation of Paul Tremblay's 2018 novel The Cabin At The End Of The World, a much better title — would be worth either his while or ours.  It's slickly enough written and acted, but it's a truly preposterous story about a gay couple and their adopted daughter whose holiday home deep in the Pennyslvania woods is invaded by a modern and curiously polite incarnation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. This strange quartet, led by a kindly teacher (Dave Bautista) and also featuring Rupert Grint as a grumpy gas-fitter (with much to be grumpy about), must convince the family that they need to start sacrificing one another if they are to save the planet from impending doom. It's not really made clear why they've been chosen from 7.8 billion or so other people in the world, and I'm afraid the film is another dud from Shyamalan, who has never come close to matching his 1999 masterpiece The Sixth Sense. In this movie he has given himself a Hitchcock-style cameo role, selling fried chicken on television . . . but perhaps he should have chosen turkey instead. A sequel to the 2011 film Puss in Boots, itself a spin-off from the Shrek movies, this one gives us Florence Pugh as the voice of Goldilocks, with Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone as Mama and Papa Bear. As you'll have gathered, Joel Crawford's film, like the original, boasts an eclectic mix of characters from legends and fairy tales: Jack Horner (John Mulaney) is an obese, hunchbacked villain, and there are cameos for Pinocchio, Jiminy Cricket, Excalibur and the Big Bad Wolf. Puss (brilliantly voiced by Banderas) is a swashbuckling, Zorro-style hero, fearless until the wolf ruins things by pointing out that he has used up eight of his nine lives. If he can find the elusive Wishing Star alongside his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss can get his eight lives back. But everyone else is searching for the Wishing Star, too, including, for more nefarious reasons, the monstrous Jack Horner and the crime family of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. It's very imaginatively done. As in Puss In Boots: The Last Wish (see below), there's a fairytale ending of sorts in To Leslie — but a lot of bleakness precedes it, as the title character (Andrea Riseborough) lurches, broke and homeless, through a miserable, alcohol-sodden existence six years after winning the Texas lottery. This low-budget film, a debut feature for British director Michael Morris, has been basking in some mostly welcome attention, after Riseborough (pictured) very unexpectedly landed a Best Actress Oscar nomination. I say 'mostly' because there are some crying foul, not to mention racism (the African-American actress Danielle Deadwyler, brilliant in Till, was overlooked), but there is no doubt it's a performance worthy of acclaim, at the heart of a tale Patsy Cline might once have expressed in song. Last seen gurning her way hilariously through the Matilda movie, Riseborough (a Tynesider, note) proves her impressive versatility by convincing utterly as a Texan deadbeat, who steals from her teenage son and seems beyond redemption before returning to her home town and, with the support of a good man, piecing her life back together.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2023"," It’s a pleasant surprise when the film that isn’t quite Shrek 5 turns out to be the best of that sequence. It’s an even bigger surprise to discover that Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is a compelling companion piece to Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory, in which a declining film practitioner (Antonio Banderas) ponders his mortality. The sequel to Puss’s 2011 stand-alone adventure sees the swashbuckling feline in fearful contemplation upon realising that he is down to the last of his nine lives. “My prescription,” says the cat’s doctor and barber, “no more adventures. You need to retire.” Thus, pursued by a glaive-wielding Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss buries his iconic footwear and settles down to a life defined by kibble and naps at a cat lady’s refuge. The nicest-looking animation to emerge from the DreamWorks imprint takes cues from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre and spaghetti western films – notably The Good, the Bad and the Ugly – as Puss takes up with his scorned old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), and a cheerful unwanted therapy dog (Harvey Guillén) on a search for a wishing star that can recoup his lost lives. Kevin McCann’s Jimmy Stewart-inspired Conscience Cricket makes for fun commentary on last year’s many Pinnochios. The chaotic cod-fairy-tale references don’t always land – the Baker’s Dozen, anyone? – but few actors are as suited to their animated avatars as Banderas is to Puss. There is a lot to like here, not least Ray Winstone’s Papa Bear. The forests are Skittle-coloured. The set pieces are wild and kinetic. But it is Banderas’s star power that saves the day.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2023"," The second solo adventure for Antonio Banderas’s ginger Zorro grossed $309million before it even opened in the UK. Not bad for the follow-up to a Shrek spin-off from 11 years ago. This time, Puss must forgo the senoritas, the swashbuckling and the full-fat milk swilling due to an accident at work. After defeating a rampaging troll, a falling church bell cuts short the showboating. When he comes round, the doctor informs him he has just exhausted eight of his nine lives. So our once-carefree hero ditches his floppy hat and boots to wander naked into Mama Lana’s Cat Rescue for a life of tasteless cat biscuits and smelly litter trays. Forming a triple act with a clingy dog called Perrito (Harvey Guillen) and old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), he sets out to find the mystical Wishing Star. The quest will see them battle a fearsome wolf (Wagner Moura), cockney gangsters Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), and the now-massive Jack Horner (John Mulaney) who appears to have outgrown his “good boy” days but stuck with the pie-eating. But the animation is gorgeous, the action is zippy and Banderas is brilliant. After a lean few months for family animation, kids and parents should lap this one up.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 3, 2023"," Until this year, my only Puss in Boots-related wish was that I would never have to sit through another film from the Shrek franchise as long as I lived. I must confess, the unexpectedly entertaining Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has entirely changed my mind! Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) squandered eight of his nine lives with a devil-may-care panache. He sang, danced and swashbuckled his way through a legendary series of adventures but his melodious pursuit of a giant may have seen the bell toll for the last time on those carefree days. Then a standoff with a foe who cannot be quipped into submission shakes the marmalade marauder to his core. What happens when the charismatic poster puss of living for tomorrow suddenly fears he will not make it through today? Mortality is a mighty foe. For Puss, the answer is to put his life of crime to rest; burying his broad-brimmed hat, cape and trademark Corinthian leather boots and any expectation of further adventure beside them. Soon his razor-sharp claws are sheathed in mittens and he is growing fluffy and docile in the home of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) with dozens of languid cat brethren and an alarmingly optimistic chihuahua for company. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish does something refreshing for a children’s film, it takes a long, unflinching look at anxiety; exploring it with a frankness that people of any age who have been frozen with similar dread will appreciate. Dreamworks’ latest production is certainly not the first time animation studios have ventured into mental health territory in recent years but the vivid depictions of panic are singular and they truly captivate. The peerless Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse continues to be a force for good in this world, this time by inspiring The Last Wish’s tactile and visually-engaging animation; its vivid storybook aesthetic is a far cry from the CG monotony of this franchise’s last outing and helps sell the heavier moments. As is the way with family features, there are still some everything but the kitchen sink scenes but there are also moments of striking artistry in silhouettes, angular crystals, the stomp of a giant and the swish of a skirt. Plot threads get messy on the chase and here your mind will wander. With the least coherent character animation and a shoehorned story tangent, John Mulaney’s Jack Horner is surplus to requirement and his contribution drags. Still, he does have a Jimmy Stewart-esque cricket (Kevin McCann) in his dastardly bag of tricks so it’s not all bad. And the irresistible charm of the central friendship journey paired with Heitor Perreira’s buoyant score further wash away the tedium. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a heartfelt adventure caper that tackles anxiety with surprising empathy and wit. A few cast members should have been lost in the woods but overall this one’s a winner!",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2023"," Move over Brendan Fraser: you’re not the only noughties family film icon making a comeback this week. Eleven years after his last cinema appearance, here is Antonio Banderas’s Puss in Boots again – or rather Poos in Booze, as the name is rendered in the velvety Spanish purr that helped make the character a favourite in the later Shrek films. And clearly, the industry at least is glad to have him back, since the film has been nominated in the Best Animation categories at the coming Oscars and Baftas. After a long career of Zorro-like swashbuckling, The Last Wish finds Puss on the ninth and last of his lives, but in no mood to shuffle off to the franchise graveyard just yet. So when word reaches him of a wishing star that has fallen in a faraway forest, he sets out to retrieve it, in the hope its powers will allow him to postpone the inevitable for a little while yet. Other interested parties are also on the trail, however, including a Vivienne Westwood-esque Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bear accomplices (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), and also Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a no-longer-so-little fruit pie magnate harbouring an inferiority complex over his nursery-rhyme roots. This is supposedly a film about coming to terms with death – and Death itself even makes a series of deliciously scary cameo appearances, in the form of a wolf (voiced by Narcos’ Wagner Moura) whose red eyes, thin smile and silver sickles glint from beneath his black hooded cloak. But aside from the chills elicited by this genuinely spooky figure, the film is almost defiantly hopeless at emotion: the tone is teeth-gnashingly manic throughout, while the underlying point of Puss’s quest is obscured by continuous flurries of slapstick and quips. Sometimes it’s quite funny – the sequence in which Puss and Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws try to out-cute one another by pulling increasingly adorable faces is a nice escalation of a series running gag. And occasionally it’s spectacular too, thanks to frequent…well, let’s be generous and say homages to classic action scenes from Japanese anime. (Buffs will recognise shots borrowed from Neon Genesis Evangelion and Attack on Titan within the first five minutes alone, in which Puss loses life number eight in a battle with a moss giant.) Rather than ploughing on with Shrek’s now dated visual style, DreamWorks has smartly adopted the stylish hybrid look pioneered by Sony Animation’s Into the Spider-Verse, which combines elements of hand-drawn and CG. There’s an entire pick ’n’ mix stand of eye candy here – more than enough to satisfy younger viewers. But alas, it’s all empty calories.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 3, 2023"," There he can grow a beard, eat disgusting dry cat food and avoid the bounty hunter wolf who is keen to get his dead body and claim a reward. And along with new friend Perrito (Harvey Guillen) — a dog who is dressed as a cat to enjoy the luxury of the sanctuary — and his old friend Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), they go on a mission to try to find it. The journey is a dangerous one, with entry into the black forest, and the trio are soon up against gangster family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who are also on a bid for the wishing star. There are some incredibly daring action sequences, and Horner and the bounty hunter wolf are both dreadful enough to keep you fearing for our furry friend’s life. Banderas brings all the usual joy and energy to the character he made his own, and uses just the right amount of humour in the role, too. Loving couple Andrew and Eric are vacationing with their adoptive daughter Wen at a secluded cabin when four armed strangers (led by Dave Bautista’s Leonard) turn up. Tight pacing from the get-go maintains a nervy edge as these four individuals demand the family make a harrowing choice: Kill one of their family to prevent the apocalypse or let the world burn. Paired with moving performances that capture a huge range of emotions, this is one of the rare Shyamalan films not to require a plot twist to succeed. Just sharp, empathetic direction, acting and writing, which reminds you that he is a filmmaker who loves to play with good and bad, hero and villain and happiness and suffering to get audiences asking philosophical questions of themselves too. THE opening scene of this Darren Aronofsky film shows a super-morbidly- obese man surrounded by debris in his dingy room, watching pornography that gives him a heart attack. He’s a teacher of English, but only does this via Zoom, where he pretends his camera has broken so his students can never see him. The only other characters are those who visit, including his friend Liz (Hong Chau) who is a nurse but also his enabler, his spiky estranged daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink), ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton) and missionary Thomas (Ty Simpkins).  But it’s Fraser who is the outright star of this masterful film, giving such a powerful performance that it will leave even the hardest heart broken.",POSITIVE
"Feb 2, 2023"," Nineteen years after his first appearance in Shrek 2, and ten after his first spin-off movie, Antonio Banderas swings back into action as Puss In Boots. The animated film’s financial success has sparked speculation about a fifth Shrek movie, but is there really anything more to be squeezed from this long-running series? We reunite with Puss In Boots (voiced by Banderas), who is going through an existential crisis. After a mishap means that he has used eight of his nine lives, he retires from adventuring and becomes depressed. However, he finds out about a map that leads to a magical wishing star. Stealing the map and reuniting with ex-fiance Kitty Soft Paws (Salma Hayek), Puss In Boots races to find the star. Considering how long the character has been away, it would be easy for the film to opt for a soft, easy subject that keeps the franchise going (looking at you, Minions). However, taking on as serious a subject as death, however whimsically, gives the story just enough depth to keep things interesting. Yes, most of the action is devoted to familiar slapstick and wacky side characters, but finding a reason to exist is the golden ticket for any sequel, and director Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) accomplishes it. While the story feels fresher, the characters are broadly the same. Hayek and Banderas have had great chemistry on screen for decades, and the added element of animation doesn’t change that winning formula. Recognisable voices like Olivia Colman, Florence Pugh, and Ray Winstone keep the giggles coming, while John Mulaney is a proven delight. If you are expecting something that will reinvigorate the genre, this will be a disappointment. However, what Puss In Boots: The Last Wish lacks in originality, it makes up for in laughs and heart.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 2, 2023"," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a heartfelt, surprisingly mature look at life and death from one heroic cat’s perspective. Read our review of the Oscar-nominated animation.  Originally a character introduced in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots was an instant fan favourite. The character’s solo film, a little unimaginatively titled Puss in Boots, premiered in 2011, and it’s taken 11 years to get a sequel to that.  At the beginning of The Last Wish, Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) finds himself on the last of his nine lives. Even fearless, swash-buckling kitties will have to face death eventually, but Puss is keen on continuing his adventures and desperately needs some extra lives.  He sets out to find a magical Wishing Star which could grant him more time on Earth. Joining him is his ex-fiancee Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek). Still, the villainous Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) are after the map to the Wishing Star too.  As you can see, the voice cast to The Last Wish is stacked, like really stacked. Oscar nominees and winners left, right and centre of it. There’s always something very giddy about hearing your favourite actor do a particularly fun voice performance. Florence Pugh is the highlight here, clearly having a ball doing a heightened Cockney accent that somehow never feels out of place in this world. Her Goldilocks is an excellent addition to the world of Shrek, firmly rooted in fairy tales but also given a surprising amount of depth here. Antonio Banderas, as per usual, is also pitch-perfect as the titular cat. His voice is sultry and seducing, so much so that it feels a little wrong for a kid’s film. The same goes for Salma Hayek. Their vocal chemistry is off the charts, making The Last Wish a treat for kiddos and adults alike.  Perhaps that’s the biggest strength of the film. It’s very clearly a kid’s film; most of the comedy is pure slapstick, but the storyline feels much more mature than previous Dreamworks animated efforts. It’s not exactly groundbreaking stuff plot-wise, but The Last Wish feels distinctly more ambitious than its predecessor.  The Last Wish also reaches for the sky with its animation style. The film mixes several different styles, which gives it a sense of prestige. The Last Wish clearly wants to hit the same notes that Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse did. Animation is a genre that is constantly evolving, and The Last Wish successfully blends different styles together for a dynamic end result, even if none of it is quite as memorable or zeitgeisty as desired.  There is also something uncanny about the human character design. In the first sequence, in which Puss is hosting a lavish party, the human faces look Disney-fied with unnaturally large eyes. This brings the film down a tad, but thankfully, the story is what really keeps The Last Wish going.  The Last Wish is funny enough to appeal to kids, but it’s also honest enough to entertain adults. There are plenty of references to other fairy tales, occasionally making The Last Wish feel like a game of bingo. The film also holds a potent, if uninspired, message about appreciating and living your life to the fullest.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a worthy sequel and Dreamworks Animation’s most ambitious, visually striking film in years. With stellar voice performances from Banderas, Hayek and Pugh, The Last Wish has cemented its place as a great sequel and a superb animated film.  ★★★★☆ The Sitting Duck unveils the gripping journey of trade unionist Maureen Kearney, brilliantly portrayed by Isabelle Huppert, amidst harrowing political intrigue and personal hardship.

"Feb 2, 2023"," Somewhat mystifyingly, some top-secret algorithmic function in DreamWorks Animation’s audience-reaction data analysis software has decreed that yet another comeback is in order for the sort of OK-ish and meh-plus character of Puss in Boots, smokily voiced by Antonio Banderas, originally seen in 2004 in Shrek 2, and then in the 2010 spinoff feature Puss in Boots. The numbers have come chuntering out of the side of some giant IBM-style computer, the suits have frowningly inspected them, and another tranche of Puss in Boots content has been greenlit. Once again, debonair outlaw Puss in Boots – a sort of cleaned-up southern European version of Jack Sparrow – is having sword-twirling adventures, again in the company of his paramour Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek); but now PiB must confront his own mortality, having used up eight of his nine lives. He is on a quest to put off the evil hour by finding the legendary wishing star which once fell to earth like a comet; he and Kitty join forces with the perky mutt Perrito (Harvey Guillén), but must battle other fairytale/nursery-rhyme honchos, including a Cockney crime family in the form of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), and “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) – to whom all the funny lines are given. Wagner Moura voices the Wolf, who is the grim reaper, wielding a couple of sickles. Really, this movie is a huge 102-minute additional scene, something that would go on the extras package of a Blu-ray edition of the previous Puss in Boots film, or possibly get its own video-on-demand release. It feels like something to put on your TV or iPad to pacify a toddler; nothing wrong with that, of course, and many stressed parents would call it the noblest artistic calling. But how bland and forgettable this film is, without in the smallest way harnessing the real performing power of Banderas, Colman, Pugh, Winstone et al.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 1, 2023"," After Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Wrestler and Black Swan, Darren Aronofsky takes his appetite for corporeal punishment to new levels with The Whale, a grim tale of compulsive self-loathing rendered as an Oscar-baiting redemption story. Brendan Fraser takes the lead as Charlie, a morbidly obese gay shut-in eating himself to death in response to the grief he feels over the unexpected death of his partner and the family he lost when he came out. Estranged from his ex-wife and teenage daughter, he lives alone, teaching college writing classes online, a gig that allows him to stay hidden from the world (he disables his webcam during Zoom classes) while feeding his excessive junk food addiction with daily take-out orders. That Charlie is a guy whose heart has literally and figuratively been broken by years of self-abuse, shame and guilt is made clear in the opening scenes: masturbating to gay porn, he has a seizure and has to be rescued by a door-stepping missionary, whom he coaxes into reading an extract from a student essay on Moby Dick that calms him down enough to prevent a full cardiac arrest. The significance of the essay will be revealed much later, though Charlie reads it again and again, treating it as an emotional crutch, as vital to his ability to get through each day as the actual walking-frame he needs to get around his cramped apartment. For the duration of the movie Fraser is buried beneath the sweaty folds and distended bulges of a 300-pound prosthetic suit, a physical transformation that all but guaranteed his Oscar nomination before the film even came out. He brings what dignity he can to the role; you can read the sadness in his eyes as a sympathetic reflection of someone trapped by the extremity of their situation. But there’s a whiff of freak-show leeriness to his presentation too – and the additional use of Charlie’s sexuality as a catalyst for his tragic situation is another well-worn Oscar trope. Aronofsky also revels a little too much in Charlie’s zoo or aquarium-like existence, deploying a boxy aspect ratio to accentuate the already tight confines of his apartment, and providing him with a parade of curious visitors and caretakers, among them his best friend Liz (Hong Chau, also Oscar nominated); Thomas (Ty Simpkins), the aforementioned missionary, and eventually Charlie’s daughter, Ellie (Stranger Things star Sadie Sink), whose unhappy life Charlie desperately wants to fix by sacrificing his own. Chau adds some spark here, but the subplots involving Simpkins' and Sink’s characters feel contrived. Aronofosky’s decision to embrace the film’s stage origins (it’s based on screenwriter Samuel D Hunter’s play of the same name) doesn’t help matters either – the stripped down aesthetic only adding to the suspicion that there’s not much more to this than the body horror spectacle of its central performance. M Night Shyamalan’s Knock at the Cabin begins in exquisitely creepy fashion with a little girl called Wen (Kristen Cue) happily playing in the woods as a stranger approaches. The stranger is polite but looks intimidating (he’s played by Dave Bautista) and Wen is savvy enough not to trust him, an instinct that will soon prove correct when the stranger and three friends force their way into the cabin Wen’s dads (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) have rented for their vacation. This being a Shyamalan film, what follows isn’t a standard home invasion thriller. Adapted from Paul Tremblay’s best-seller A Cabin at the End of the World, it’s a twisty armageddon-themed horror with Bautista and his cohorts (played by Rupert Grint, Nikki Amuka-Bird and Abby Quinn) an intriguing spin on the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Shyamalan remains great at using his camera to switch perspectives and destabilise what we think we know of a story and though he doesn’t quite find a way to resolve the ambiguity of the premise without resorting to literalness in the hokey finale, this and last year’s Old suggest he’s very much back on form. Donkeys are currently having quite the moment in arthouse films, featuring in Triangle of Sadness, The Banshees of Inisherin and now EO, a surreal updating of Robert Bresson’s Au Hasard Balthazar designed to provide a reflective snap-shot of modern-day Europe by following the travails of the titular donkey as it changes ownership after being cut loose from the circus. Directed by veteran Polish filmmaker Jerzy Skolimowski, the film deploys impressionistic flourishes, point-of-view shots and even suggests EO has a romantic yearning for his former trainer. Mostly, though, this passive protagonist functions as a placid barometer of human civility. Isabelle Huppert co-stars. Donkey doesn’t feature in Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, but given this belated sequel to 2011’s original Puss in Boots sets up a future return to Far Far Away, don’t rule out his re-appearance at some point. This film, though, finds its Antonio Banderas-voiced feline swashbuckler reckoning with mortality after using up eight of his nine lives. The plot thus finds him on a quest to find a wishing star in the hope of restoring the lives he’s recklessly frittered away, a quest complicated by other fairytale characters intent on securing the wish for themselves. In the tradition of Shrek, the film has fun deconstructing fairytale lore, though what really distinguishes it is the animation, which has a more painterly and pleasingly hand-crafted feel. Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Salma Hayek Pinault are among new and returning voice cast.",NEUTRAL

After more than a decade, the feline favourite is back on the big screen, fighting, flirting and… feeling the cold breath of death on his furry shoulders. This fun, frenetic and fleet-footed sequel to Puss in Boots (2011) explores depths undreamed of in recent sweet-natured Netflix series spin-off The Adventures of… It isn’t afraid to stray over to the dark side, as when Puss’ fatal opening scrap with a tree troll leaves him with just one of his reckless lives left. He also has an unbeatable Big Bad Wolf bounty hunter on his tail (Wagner Moura, growling out Narcos-worthy menace). Consigned to the daily litter-box-and-kibble torment of Mama Luna’s (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) cat sanctuary, Banderas’ gato macho sinks into a hilariously deadpan existential crisis. But co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s storytelling soon has him chasing a map leading to the fabled Wishing Star, desperate to restore his nine lives and legendary status.  Puss forms a bickering trio with old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and clingy therapy-dog Perrito (a scene-stealing Harvey Guillén); setting off to rob the map from ‘Big’ Jack Horner (John Mulaney), our heroes’ quest becomes a family-friendly spaghetti western: The Good, the Bad and the Cuddly, basically. In high Shrek-franchise style, the filmmakers cram The Last Wish with galloping action laced with sly, knowing fairytale gags. Take Florence Pugh’s grasping gangster Goldilocks and her quarreling cockney Three Bears crime family, who are also in hot pursuit of the Star in the Dark Forest. And then there’s Mulaney’s magic-snatching Jack Horner, a mobster so immoral that his Jiminy Cricket-style ‘Ethical Bug’ (voiced by Kevin McCann) can’t find his conscience. Though there’s much to chortle at here, Paul Fisher’s smart scripting also provides notably chewy characters and themes for a comic romp whose warm, painterly animation suggests a classic storybook. As Puss, Kitty and Goldilocks wrestle with their wishes (and the Dark Forest’s trippily animated carnivorous plants and mind-bending glades), the story offers some graceful, understated lessons about the difference between ‘wants’ and ‘needs’. However, what really elevates this sophisticated sequel is Banderas’ rich voicework, which reveals that, under Puss’ suave bluster, there’s a moody moggie discovering fear for the first time. For once, as he faces up to the Wolf’s ferocious blades, the stakes are as big as the laughs for the stabby tabby. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is out in UK cinemas from February 3.

"Jan 30, 2023"," ‘My compliments to your cobbler,’ says the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) to Puss In Boots (Antonia Banderas) is the latest cartoon caper from Dreamworks. Given that this is the first sequel to a spin-off to the Sherk franchise, which is pretty much played out since igniting the CGI animation world back, check notes, 22 years ago, anticipation was pretty limited for this one. Expectations aside, it’s a light, fluffy adventure with plenty of knowing gags; whether you love cats or not, Joel Crawford’s film is not a load of old cobblers nor one from the bottom of the litter tray. A lavish, quick off-the mark action set piece shows us that Puss in Boots is getting old; a giant bell falls squarely on his furry little nog and a doctor suggests that he has now used up eight of his nine lives. A chance encounter with the Big Bad Wolf makes a cowardly cat of our hero, who buries his heroic garb and decides to sit out any potential conflicts. But Puss is being sought after by Goldilocks and the Three Bears, who are seeking the Wishing Star that can grant one single wish; of course, Puss in Boots wants nothing more than to get his eight lives back, and goes off in search, accompanied by Kitty Softpaws, voiced by Salma Hayek. As a Dreamworks animation, this is still a cut above most; Florence Pugh is Goldilocks, and Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone are Mama and Papa Bear respectively. But the MVP here is comic John Mulaney, who brings a louche yet manic energy to Little Jack Horner, one of several nursery rhyme characters who get pressed into service here. Appreciating what you’ve got and not betting it all on imponderables is the clear message here, and The Last Wish just about delivers it with some lively voice work and a rather more dynamic animation feel than the previous entry in the franchise. Given the films striking box-office success as counterprogramming to the Avatar sequel, it’s unlikely that this will be the last we see of Puss; while a little darker than the other Shrek films, it’s charming and cute enough to satisfy family audiences. Gags like Puss claiming ‘I am a master of the baking’ suggest a little of the old Shrek humour for adults creeping in, and while the formula is aging like the furrball protagonist, Puss in Boots is the cat’s pyjamas as far as comfort food for kids goes.

"Jan 29, 2023"," Once upon a time, there was a cat who was hired to get rid of an ogre. However, he was no match for the ogre or his ‘trusty steed’ so it joined them on their quest to live ‘happily ever after’. Little did they know that this boot-wearing Hispanic cat would become a hero in its own right while expanding the world of fairy tales for audiences worldwide. 12 years after his first solo film, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) returns in an overdue sequel, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Starring a star-studded cast, the swashbuckling feline ventures on a quest through the mysterious Dark Forest to find a Wishing Star – but he is not the only one. Ever since we first met Puss in Boots in Shrek 2, his character has been all about the ‘legend’ that is, Puss in Boots. However, this latest instalment sees his legacy claim eight of his nine lives through his own amusing arrogance. Worried about what his life will become if he died or worse, was a normal cat, he chooses to hide away from death (or a Big Bad Wolf voiced by Wagner Maura) and resign to the mundane life of a house cat. But when Puss hears about a wishing star that can replenish his lost lives, he decides to take on Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), as well as magic collector Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), to find it – with the help of a new canine companion (Harvey Guillén) and love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault). As we enter the sixth instalment of the Shrek franchise, audiences have already seen a lot of well-known fairy tale characters reimagined during its over-20-year history. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish seem to continue the series’ magic of reviving famous characters in a mostly villainous and hilarious way. In this instalment, Goldilocks and The Three Bears are reimagined as a crime family (think the Mitchells from Eastenders) and nursery rhyme character Big Jack Horner has grown up to run a huge pie corporation with a grudge against fairy tale magic. Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay allows the characters to find their way without being heavy-hearted. Everyone is quite selfish regarding their respective wishes, whether it is new lives, a family or their own ‘happy ever after’, but everyone, along with Puss and Kitty Softpaws, is relentless in their pursuit of the Wishing Star to comical effect. The screenplay also allows them to display some vulnerability and frustration with their own circumstances, enabling them to slowly appreciate what they have, rather than crave something superficial. Although Goldi and the Bears allow their family dynamic to sometimes dampen their effectiveness as fairy tale gangsters, one of the other new additions is a consistent scene-stealer. Referred to as Purrito, the over-excited, sock-wearing pup offers buckets of enthusiasm and charm without delving into over-sentimentalism. But it is his empathy that makes him such a great addition – in a franchise where a lot of characters are all about their own desires, Purrito is happy to appreciate what is in front of him despite his ignorance of his tragic puphood. His ambition to be a therapy dog also delivers sweet moments and makes him a great buffer between the anti-social, bickering yet adorable felines. The vast array of characters allows director Joel Crawford to make the most of the film’s eclectic voice cast. Mainstays Banderas and Hayek Pinault are consistently brilliant with Pugh, Colman, Winston and Kayo amping up the Cockney gangster vibe as Goldi and the Three Bears. Additional credit goes to Guillén, Maura and Mulaney for their respective performances as their characters help bring complexity to the table. Following last year’s The Bad Guys, Dreamworks continues to incorporate a grittier animation style after the success of Into The Spiderverse. This sees less detail in the intricacy of the characters but elevates the action scenes to a comic book style while retaining the fantastical elements worthy of a fairy tale. Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a brilliantly entertaining instalment of the Shrek franchise. With dazzling colours, great characters and jokes galore, it is unadulterated family entertainment.",POSITIVE
"Jan 28, 2023"," You’d be forgiven for thinking that the Shrek franchise was on its last life by now. While the 2001 original and its even-funnier 2004 sequel shook up the status quo with their sharp Disney-fairy-tale satire, diminishing returns saw the anarchic ogre’s impact dwindle over time. It’s fair to say, then, that Puss In Boots: The Last Wish — a sequel to a spin-off that graced cinema screens over a decade ago — doesn’t arrive with much momentum behind it. That it frequently explodes into sequences of vital, visually dazzling, capital-c Cinema is a truly unexpected delight. In its opening 15 minutes, it’s clear that The Last Wish is fighting tooth and claw to exceed expectations — kicking off with a kinetic kitty versus kaiju set-piece that re-establishes the legendary status of Puss In Boots for an audience who have likely long moved on. Antonio Banderas (who originated the role way back in Shrek 2) returns to voice the Zorro-styled, leche-lapping swashbuckler, whose diminutive stature belies feats of highwire heroism. Taking on a moss-covered mountain beast with only his rapier, it’s an eye-boggling, pulse-pounding sequence, gorgeously animated in striking digital-paint brushstrokes, and intentionally stuttering Spider-Verse-esque frame-rate effects. The effect is dazzling — once again, it’s apparent that Spider-Verse has upped the game of every animation studio in town. The Last Wish capitalises on that with visual flourishes that bring real dynamism to its action scenes, breaking away from the homogenous stylings of late-’00s 3D animation to deliver ultra-expressive, impressionistic imagery. That boundary-pushing extends to the themes explored here, too — if younger viewers won’t necessarily be familiar with Puss In Boots himself, they also likely won’t be expecting a treatise on mortality and PTSD. But that’s The Last Wish’s central preoccupation, as Puss realises his nine lives have dwindled down to one (capped off in a hilarious moggy-murder-montage), and that death itself is rapidly approaching. With stakes this high, notions this existential, and a superhero this hairy, it often plays like a kid-friendly Logan. Everything exceptional about The Last Wish makes the more generic elements stand out, such as the supporting characters, some of which don’t quite sing. A gangster-family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) wring few laughs, while villain Jack Horner (John Mulaney) also feels like a distraction. But in most regards, The Last Wish is a minor miracle — visually daring, frequently funny, and surprisingly emotional. Against all the odds, it could bring the Shrek series back to all-star status.",POSITIVE

Blends comedy, action, and some tender moments (the panic attack scene is a powerful memory), while also reuniting Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault in a winning and wonderful way. I suppose if you were not a fan of Shrek films or the previous Puss in Boots film from 2011, this may be of little to no interest to you. Though it has near unanimous acclaim, some feel the film is convoluted, borrows from other film concepts, and is thin on plot and story. Not my take, but it is a take that is out there. Sometimes you just have to tip your hat, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sequel I never thought I needed. Though a fan of the first Shrek films, where the Antonio Banderas-voiced “Puss in Boots” character first debuted, I was rather lackluster on the Banderas-led spinoff in 2011. Puss in Boots had a couple fun moments: some fun banter between Banderas and Salma Hayek Pinault’s Kitty Softpaws and the “Oooohhh Cat,” who became a meme for a number of years on social media. However, the 2011 film is largely forgettable and nothing I have revisited since watching it all those years ago.And so, imagine my surprise when minutes into the sequel I am laughing rather heartily. Or stepping back and admiring the different animation techniques used to establish characters and distinguish between feelings of fear, arrogance, and the normal look-and-feel of the Shrek and Shrek-adjacent movies. Banderas’ performance is full of energy and vitality. The movie begins at a brisk pace, packed with grand enthusiasm. Suffice to say, this film feels a whole lot different than its predecessor.In The Last Wish, Puss learns he must live more carefully and with less brazen risk. After he is brought back by his doctor, following an unfortunate encounter with a massive bell, Puss realizes he has used up eight of his nine lives. With only one life left, Puss begins to rationalize changes he needs to make, while also encountering a Grim Reaper-style wolf (Wagner Moura), who haunts him seemingly at every turn.Though it can feel intense, and younger viewers may have a need to snuggle up with someone they trust when the striking, menacing wolf arrives on screen, The Last Wish is largely a breeze. To hide away from the wolf, Puss hides out in a cat sanctuary, run by the sweet-tempered Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). One of a few dozen cats overseen by Mama Luna, Puss resigns himself to being a housecat, giving up his swashbuckling, adventurous life for that of a plain old domestic. Over time, a new arrival, a chihuahua in disguise named Perrito (a scene-stealing Harvey Guillén), becomes an ally. The stakes amplify when Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) shows up, along with her Three Bears, to claim a ransom on Puss. When Puss learns that the opportunity to gain a wish comes in the form of “The Wishing Star,” he seeks to find the star, even if it means he runs up against another potential danger in “Big” Jack Horner, the large, grown-up version of “Little” Jack Horner, voiced by John Mulaney.  Sometimes you just have to tip your hat, and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the sequel I never thought I needed.

Goldilocks and the Three Bears (including Olivia Colman as Mama Bear), the Wolf, and Jack Horner all want to take Puss’ last life. I suppose something can be said about the deck being stacked against our proverbial feline hero, but the movie bogs down quite a bit when it tries to give weight and meaning to each villain’s story and journey towards ending Puss in Boots once and for all.Hayek Pinault’s spitfire return as Kitty Softpaws, a love/hate love interest for Puss, is fun and Guillén, who you may know from the FX series, “What We Do in the Shadows,” is tremendous. The animation is especially impressive, mixing different styles and looks, depending on the nature of the threat and the scene. While Jack Horner looks bulbous and large (a bit over-the-top though, if being honest), the Wolf has a stark, intense presence that feels different than anything else in the film. The Shrek franchise certainly has its distinctive presentation, which is visible here, but the backdrops and the details are much more enhanced than I remember. Even when the story lags, or much of the action takes place in the center of the screen (a constant frustration with American animation), letting your eyes wander around and take in what’s in the background reaps some great rewards.Maybe the bar was set low, but even with too many villains and a reliance on a few too many action and fight scenes, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is quite the fun surprise to uncover at year’s end. Director Joel Crawford, and co-director Januel Mercado, have found a way to make this character matter, and the adventures fairly meaningful, as we potentially find Puss and his friends reconnecting with some of their “old friends” again in the future.

"Jan 20, 2023"," There, I said it. I may get criticized, I may get canceled, I may get banned from Shrekfest for life. But I needed to speak my truth. The “Puss in Boots” movies, both the 2011 original and the new sequel “The Last Wish,” run circles around the “Shrek” movies they spun off from. Much of the charm of ""Puss in Boots"" is due to the voice acting of Antonio Banderas, whose rum-bottle-wrapped-in-velvet purr is hilarious. He's an orange tabby who’s also a swashbuckling adventurer very much in the vein of Zorro (who Banderas played in 1998’s “The Mask of Zorro”). Puss even carves a “P” into the shirt of one of his adversaries with his sword, in case you missed the connection. “The Last Wish” opens with Puss at the top of his game, singing, swinging and slashing his way through bad guys (including a lumbering giant) in the colorful opening sequence. The animation style has even upped its game as well — the computer-generated 3D is given colorful textures that look like they were made with a paintbrush. During the fight scenes, the frame rate of the animation drops a little, making the action a little choppier but more dynamic to watch. Puss does get smashed by the giant — but he’s got nine lives, so what does he care? Except that his doctor has been keeping score, and informs Puss that he’s already used up eight of them. (There’s a funny montage of all eight of his deaths, including ignoring a shellfish allergy.) Now a wolf Grim Reaper is stalking Puss, patiently waiting for Death No. 9, which leaves Puss not feeling so footloose and fancy free. Puss tries retiring from the swashbuckling game and gets adopted by a cat lady (Da’vine Joy Randolph), but the simple life doesn’t stick. Reunited with his old love interest/rival, the master thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss heads off on a quest to find the “wishing star” that can restore his spent eight lives. Also on the trail of the star, in a “Treasure of the Sierra Madre”-style plot, are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), who seem like storybook characters as written by Guy Ritchie. And Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who has turned his love of pies into a criminal enterprise, is also on the hunt. Directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed Januel Mercado, “The Last Wish” consistently delivers good jokes for young and old, dazzling visuals, and an earnest message about living the life you’ve got. Banderas and Hayek have been screen partners from 1995’s “Desperado” to this year’s black comedy “Official Competition,” and they have a warm chemistry here as the feuding cats. But the two feline thieves almost have the movie stolen from them by Harvey Guillen of “What We Do in the Shadows” as a guileless mutt named Perro who latches onto the pair’s quest. It might be time for a spinoff of the spinoff featuring Perro. Share your opinion on this topic by sending a letter to the editor to tctvoice@madison.com.

"Jan 19, 2023"," PLOT: Puss in Boots is back, and this time he is nearly out of his nine lives. Thankfully he may have an answer. With the legend of a lost star that can grant a single wish, he and his pals seek out this magical item in hopes to prolong his kitty lives. REVIEW: The cat is back. Over a decade after the first cat-centric adventure, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish makes a swashbuckling return to the big screen. Antonio Banderas is back as Puss, along with his on-and-off romantic interest, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). This time, the cast includes a good-hearted undercover puppy played by by the scene-stealer Harvey Guillén. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks, and her three bears (Olivia Coleman, Samson Kayo, and Ray Winstone) are all terrific. John Mulaney shows up as the adult version of Jack Horner – if you remember the nursery rhyme – and he embraces it rather well. And William Moura is delightfully wicked as the Big Bad Wolf hunting down the legendary furball. And yes, animated adventures are in season with this delightful family film from Dreamworks. After an impressive opening celebration in the town of all things Puss, the cat faces the fact that he is on the last of his nine lives. Having been warned that he must end his adventurous ways, he is convinced to become a lapcat. However, Puss’ fate is not with cat lady De’Vine Joy Randolph. Unfortunately for him, the Big Bad Wolf, a bounty hunter, is hot on his trail to take him in. However, you can’t keep Puss down. When he runs into an old friend, the sly Kitty Softpaws (Hayek), the two find themselves hunting for a legendary star that will grant one final wish. With only one life left, Puss is desperate to find a magical gift to grant someone the legend of the “last wish.” Yet Kitty, Puss, and their adorable companion Perro (Harvey Guillén) aren’t the only ones on the prowl. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish starts with a bang. The opening action sequence is surprisingly exciting. And yes, it all leads to many humorous adventures. Even still, the Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado-directed feature is just as thrilling as it is charming. The entire premise of searching for what could grant the most potent wish brings a sense of wonder and thrills. Within the world, the characters must follow a map that leads them on dangerous roads which appear impossible to maneuver through. Yet the way they find their destination is decidedly exciting. The Last Wish works on many levels. It’s a visual treat with a sweet script, and it also mixes humor and big blockbuster moments rather well. Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek make for a great on-screen duo once again. The two balance each other perfectly with their terrific vocal performances. One scene where they try and out cute each other had me laughing, quite literally, out loud. That happened a few times, and that’s an absolute joy to feel while watching an animated flick. The side characters add to the fun. Harvey Guillén brings on the adorableness of Perro. Florence Pugh is a firecracker as Goldilocks, along with the three bears, beautifully done by Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo. And if you want a couple of solid Shrek-like bad guys, we got em. Wagner Moura’s Big Bad Wolf and John Mulaney’s Jack Horner offer clever villainy for a movie like this. Ultimately, the sequel brings the visual flair and the enjoyable characters to the forefront. The script manages a return to the charms of the Shrek-inspired franchise. Way back when, Mike Myers brought an edge to the fairy tale come to life. And with this, there’s much for adults as well. Even the premise within the script written by Tommy Swerdlow and Paul Fisher handles aging in an entertaining, yet heartfelt way. The final act has a sweet message that will charm even the most cynical viewers. The Last Wish is a sequel that manages to bring back much of the magic from before. All the way back to when we first were introduced to this fantastical Far Far Away. And yes, the new film does tie into that in an inspired way. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a solid return for the imaginative and comedic fairy tale world. As a sequel to a film from 2011, the magic holds up better than one may expect. The cast is great, and the visuals are wildly impressive. The sequel may not change how we see animated cinema, but it will undoubtedly bring laughs aplenty to the whole family. I was smiling ear to ear for most of this feature. And yes, even I found myself curious to see if we can have yet another good sequel from the land that is Far, Far Away. If you still long for Shrek and friends, you’ll be happy to hear that this is a witty and action-packed return to that quirky and comedic magic.",POSITIVE
"Jan 19, 2023"," A sequel to 2011’s Puss in Boots, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Antonio Banderas’ title character as he teams up with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and Perrito (Harvey Guillén) to track down the mystical Last Wish for the Wishing Star. It’s clear, ultimately, that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is at its best in its lighthearted and frequently funny opening stretch, as filmmaker Joel Crawford, armed with Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow’s screenplay, has suffused the proceedings with a brisk, tongue-in-cheek sensibility that’s heightened by a smattering of agreeable jokes and digressions (eg a montage of exactly how Puss lost eight of his nine lives) – with the watchable vibe heightened by Banderas and his various costars’ amusing voice work. (John Mulaney’s larger-than-life turn as the villainous Jack Horner remains a highlight, to be sure.) There’s little doubt, then, that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish‘s overall impact is hindered by a hit-and-miss midsection that places far too pronounced an emphasis on loud, over-the-top action sequences (ie it’s all just so frenetic), and the movie, which admittedly does conclude on a relatively satisfying note, does feel like it might’ve benefited from both a shorter running time and a more low-key execution – with the final result a decent-enough animated endeavor that could (and should) have been so much better.",POSITIVE

"Jan 19, 2023"," The Shrek franchise is a muddled one at best. The first film is fantastic and Shrek 2 is decent while Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After just drain a tired ogre’s swamp for everything it’s worth. The overall disappointment with where the franchise headed in later sequels put off the desire to ever see the 2011 Puss in Boots film. However, it may be worth a visit now since Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is so exceptionally great and the best animated film of the year.  Directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado (The Croods: A New Age) with a story by Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch) and Tom Wheeler (Puss in Boots) and a screenplay by Paul Fisher (The Lego Ninjago Movie) and Tommy Swerdlow, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has an animation style that is drastically different from the realistic style you’ve come to associate with Shrek and Puss in Boots. Utilizing drastic perspectives, action sequences that slow down to emphasize major blows before speeding up again, and different frame rates to give characters and enemies unique movements, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is visually similar to the likes of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and The Bad Guys. The film is essentially a race to the star to see who can get the wish first. Puss is accompanied by a female cat named Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Their troubled past keeps them in constant conflict. When Puss briefly retires as a hero, he meets a therapy dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) who is now convinced they are best friends, is happy about everything, and doesn’t want to wish for anything. Standing in the way of Puss and his wish is the criminal masterminds Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) and the relentless and magic-obsessed Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Like Shrek, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish toys with being more adult than the average animated film. Visually dark at times with flashes of red and orange and constant close encounters with death, The Last Wish also deals with more mature dialogue with both, “crap,” and, “hell,” being muttered on at least one occasion and Baby being referred to as a “dingleberry.” Perrito also gets bleeped for his heavier use of vulgarity. One of his more memorable sequences is when a long line of bleeps covers up his insults about the three bears. Hearing John Mulaney as a villain of any film, animated or otherwise, is a bit odd and takes some getting used to. Mulaney is no stranger to animation as a regular on Big Mouth and as the voice of Chip in this year’s Disney+ exclusive film Chip ‘n Dale: Rescue Rangers. But this is the first time Mulaney hasn’t exaggerated his voice into that nasal tone you’ve come to expect from Andrew Glouberman or even Mulaney’s own standup. Mulaney is more relaxed here as Jack Horner, which only makes his angry outbursts all the more unsettling. Bits of comedy still drip through Horner’s dialogue, but the character is mostly heartless and Mulaney delivers a startling performance to match. Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio explored a familiar tale with a different concept; the wooden boy never wanted to be human. Pinocchio is the only character in the film not controlled by strings. In a conceptually similar fashion, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish dives into loving the life you have and appreciating every day as if it’s your last rather than relying on a wish to make everything better for you. While the humor is often laugh-out-loud funny, Puss actually goes through some severe character development over the course of The Last Wish. He matures and goes in an unexpected direction. The way the film reopens the door to future installments is masterfully subtle in a way that doesn’t feel like obvious sequel bait, as well. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is stylish and fun with sleek animation, a thrillingly adventurous story, off-the-wall humor, and fantastic writing that is penned in a way that rejuvenates what was thought to be a dead CGI animated franchise.",POSITIVE
"Jan 19, 2023"," Kids may pick up some words in Spanish if they don't already know them. From Perrito's model, they can learn the value of positive thinking and of supporting your friends. Family is where you find it, who you make it. If we only have one life to live, we should make the most of it and surround ourselves with those we love. Fame can be lonely and its pursuit ultimately meaningless; true connections with others are more valuable. Puss ultimately realizes how much he cares for others in his life and makes sacrifices for them. Kitty Softpaws sets resentment aside to rescue Puss and Perrito and work with them as a team. Perrito's positive outlook makes his life's path much easier; he's a good and loyal friend. Goldilocks and the bears seek out trouble but are a strong family unit. Jack Horner is a clear villain, but his backstory does attempt to give him some relatability. Voice cast is led by Spanish and Latino actors (Banderas, Hayek, Guillén, etc.) who mix Spanish words and phrases into their dialogue and singing. Other lead characters are voiced by international actors, mostly from the United States, England, Brazil. A minor character (a woman who takes in stray cats) is Black. But ""fat"" is used as an insult, and Jack Horner's size/shape is suggested to be part of what makes him unappealing. Characters face frequent threats, including death in the form of a scary assassin wolf. Puss is killed in an early scene but comes back to life because he's a cat. He then reviews the (comical) ways he was killed eight previous times (including being shot out of a cannon, being squashed by a heavy weight, falling from a significant height, etc.). Animated action sequences involve swords and knives, ominous journeys through menacing settings, fights, falls, explosions, fire, crashes, and so on. Jack Horner is cruel, intimidating, and quick to risk others' lives. One of his minions is eaten by a plant; his skeleton is shown. Puss has a panic attack. ""Hell,"" ""crap,"" ""wuss,"" ""butt,"" ""pooping,"" ""idiot,"" ""freaking,"" ""stupid,"" ""weird,"" ""bull,"" ""jerks,"" ""fat"" (as an insult), and words (seems like mostly ""s--t"") that are bleeped out. ""Dingleberries"" are mentioned. In one of his death scenes, Puss is staggeringly drunk (revisited via flashback a couple of times). Puss also laps up milk in a bar. Parents need to know that Puss in Boots: The Last Wish -- which centers on popular Shrek 2 character Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) -- ratchets up the franchise's peril a notch. Puss is down to the last of his nine lives, and he's pursued throughout the movie by a creepy, whistling manifestation of death in the form of a wolf who wields two sharp crescent-shaped swords. In his pursuit of the mystical Last Wish, which could restore his squandered lives, Puss encounters a series of other menacing characters, ominous situations, and violent fights (with swords, knives, and other weapons). But he also learns lessons about the value of positive thinking, working with others, and prioritizing loved ones over selfish pursuits. The voice cast, led by a Spanish and Latino cast, peppers the dialogue with Spanish. Language includes ""hell,"" ""crap,"" ""wuss,"" ""butt,"" ""pooping,"" ""idiot,"" ""freaking,"" ""stupid,"" ""weird,"" and some bleeped words. Puss is shown staggeringly drunk in a couple of scenes that are played for humor. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. Fearless hero Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) is enjoying the spoils of his fame when he's unexpectedly killed at the start of PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. As he's brought back to life, he's warned that he has now run through eight of his nine lives. The reality of his mortality fills Puss with a newfound fear of death. This is amplified by the menacing wolf (Wagner Moura) who begins pursuing him, promising to take his last life. Puss goes into hiding at a cat rescue home, where he meets an innocent and lonely chihuahua, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), who clings to Puss as his new best friend. One day, the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) and Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) show up at Puss' hideout, and the cat overhears their plans to make off with a magical map that will lead them to the mystical Last Wish -- which could perhaps be the secret of regaining his immortality. Puss takes off, Perrito on his tail, to find the map and make his wish. En route, he encounters more threats, especially Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and runs into old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault). Shrek's charismatic cat buddy is back in fine form in this action-packed sequel. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish might have done well to focus more on its characters, both familiar and new, and less on the nonstop action. The chase and fight scenes are visually impressive, but, narratively, they get old quickly. What doesn't get old is Puss' smug confidence in his feline fierceness and ""fearless hero"" status -- or adorable newcomer Perrito's innate goodness. It's almost a letdown when the fantabulous opening musical number gives way to a traditional chase and fight scene. The voice cast -- led by Banderas, love interest Hayek, and newcomer Guillén as the charming chihuahua -- is once again purr-fect. And the movie throws in quite a bit of Spanish in ways both natural (exclamations) and complementary (the soundtrack). The music is one of the film's standout elements. Overseen by Brazilian composer Heitor Pereira, the soundtrack ranges from original pieces sung by Pereira and Banderas or Latin American stars like Gaby Moreno and Karol G to reworked classics, like a Spanish-infused version of The Doors' ""The End"" (Puss' own Apocalypse Now?). The story's blend of fairy tale characters can be a tad confusing -- menacing villain Jack Horner, a selfish Goldilocks sometimes confused for Bo Peep, and a big, bad wolf. It's part of the Shrek franchise's personality, but unrecognized characters could have functioned just as well and maybe have been less muddied, allowing even more focus on the fanciful felines. The reality is that many viewers will come for the cat -- and this latest adventure does assure that they'll stay for the cat. Families can talk about what Puss learns over the course of his adventures in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. What do Perrito and Kitty Softpaws show him through their own actions? How do they all learn to work as a team? How did the scary/violent scenes in this movie compare to those in the other Shrek and Shrek-related movies? What's the impact of media violence on kids?

"Jan 18, 2023"," Oh, the joy of walking into a movie with no expectations, as I did for “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” and coming away with a big goofy grin, because of the abundant humor and attention to the animation detail that combine for a surprisingly delightful gem. For those who don’t remember, Puss — as charmingly voiced by Antonio Banderas — was a supporting player in the second “Shrek” movie, the adventuresome cat repurposed as a Zorro-like swashbuckler. He got his own movie in 2011, and apparently the minds at DreamWorks thought he should get another one. I don’t really care how it happened, but it’s wonderful that it did, because “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish’ may be the best movie in the “Shrek” franchise. The movie starts with Puss doing what he does best: Battling bad guys, saving townsfolk, and looking debonair doing it. At the end of this particular adventure — rendered with full action-movie adrenaline by directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado — Puss gets crushed by the town’s massive church bell. Well, no problem for a cat with nine lives, right? Well, maybe not, when Puss counts up his past lives (a clever montage of mishaps and misplaced bravado), and realizes that he’s down to his last life. Puss decides to retire his sword, and enter a nursing home for cats — but there’s only so much soft living a cat of adventure can take. Then he hears there’s a map that can show him the location of the legendary wishing star, and Puss is back in action. But he’s not the only one looking for the map — which was purchased at great expense by the evil head of a pie-baking conglomerate, Big Jack Horner (voiced by comedian John Mullaney). Puss goes to Jack’s lair to steal it, and finds he’s competing for the map with his nemesis and ex-girlfriend, Kitty Softpaws (again voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault, giving us the “Desperado” reunion we always wanted). Puss and Kitty reluctantly join forces, accompanied by an overeager chihuahua they call Perro (and voiced by Harvey Guillen from “What We Do in the Shadows”). Also on the scent of the map is one of the area’s toughest crime families: The Three Bears (voiced by Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), with their adopted daughter, Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh). And Jack has assembled his goon squad, the Baker’s Dozen, go get his map back. Puss also has to worry about someone who’s chasing him: The Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura, Pablo Escobar from “Narcos”), who’s both a bounty hunter and the embodiment of Death.  There’s a tactile roughness to the computer animation that’s surprisingly energizing, as if the filmmakers decided the action was moving too fast to render too many details. The look matches the pacing, which is usually as fast as Puss’ swordplay and his verbal quips. (Puss’ defiant catchphrase, “Fear me, if you dare!,” will never cease being funny to me.) “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is one of those split-level animated movie that serves up a fun story for the kids, and jokes that will sail over the children’s heads and land with the grown-ups. That approach doesn’t always work on both levels, but when it delights the way this one does, it’s pretty special.",POSITIVE
"Jan 18, 2023"," Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments. The running time is 1 hour and 40 minutes.",POSITIVE
"Jan 15, 2023"," Whereas most remakes hold some reverence for what came before, the newest House Party movie just lets its fun flag fly. It takes a pretty novel concept (House Party, but at LeBron James’ house) and executes it without too much unnecessary self-seriousness and a bevy of smart stunt castings. Some of the jokes here are mercilessly funny, including one NFL star cameo that has to be one of the best gags in a studio comedy in eons. It’s a shame that this one isn’t getting the best reception, if only because it’s yet another studio comedy that does exactly what you need it to do. What is the bar we are rating these movies with? Do they all have to be sophisticated enough to appeal to the most demanding audiences? Every now and again, it’s just nice to get a soundly written, genuinely funny, admirably silly comedy that doesn’t ask too, too much from its viewer. This is the first movie I’ve ever seen where the main character is based on someone whose Office recaps I used to read pretty regularly. It’s about what you’d expect. Michael Showalter is competent enough to make the real-life drama sink in, and the cast is good enough to sell it. I can’t say all of the stylistic choices worked, and the first act takes some time to really take root. But, y’know, only a jackass could watch the third act and not feel something. A pretty study February chiller with snow everywhere and Henry Melling doing his best Foghorn Leghorn impression. I’m not sure why Christian Bale did this movie since his role doesn’t really ask much of him. But if Scott Cooper is his boy, then you be there for your boy. I’m a sucker for showbiz docs, and I quite liked this one because I think it’s the best thing we’ve gotten in a long time that actually deals with the VFX revolution. This would make a hell of a narrative feature, but they’d never be able to get Disney, ILM or LucasFilm to sign off on anything that this doc deals with (understandably). Steve Williams was a genius, but damn, it sucks to watch a guy realize later in life that he pissed away his success trying to stick it to the man that really wasn’t, y’know, all that bad. Dennis Muren kind of takes one on the chin here, and I think it would’ve been valuable for him to try to explain his side of the story. However, it’s easy to see that it takes a silent village to make these movies, and that the folks winning the Oscars always have people behind them making this all work. That’s true of all jobs on a movie set, but a good reminder all the same. The Puss in Boots movies are much better than the last two Shrek films, which were kind of dumb and greedy. The Spider-Verse animation style is certainly a diversion from the classic DreamWorks format, even though I thought The Bad Guys used it to better effect. Puss’ reckoning with his mortality is much more engaging than the wishing star McGuffin, but it’s all pretty fun and emotionally surprising. We’re probably past due for another Shrek movie, and this was a good reminder that there is more to do there now that DreamWorks seems like it’s actually trying again with the golden goose. Quite enjoyed this. I wasn’t crazy about the stage show, but this was electric. “Revolting Children” is one of the best scenes of the year, full-stop. Emma Thompson is a hell of a Trunchbull, and Alisha Weir and Lashana Lynch are perfect for the material. This is just a thoroughly good stage-to-screen. Feels like it’s going to find its audience and stick around for a while. Better than the 90s one! Clearly ridiculous, but damn it, we didn’t know what we had. This was a blast, and startlingly emotional by the end. The Aerosmith song is still a bop. It’s the affable hangout movie that I kind of expected it to be, with a delightful George Clinton cameo, a great Robin Harris performance and one of the most “oh…oh dear” dated comedy bits of the early 90s. Kid ‘N Play could spit, though! I still don’t know if this is quite the Dadaist masterpiece people make it out to be, whereas a movie like Hot Rod accomplishes the purposeful absurdism with a lot more consistency. I’d love to have seen the Warner Bros. executive who lost his everlasting mind after sitting down and watching millions and millions of dollars shoveled into a furnace for the Vince Vaughn Christmas comedy they were assured would be a laugh fest for the whole family. What a weird ass movie. It’s not really for kids, it’s not really for adults, it’s not really for anyone who enjoys Christmas. It’s a movie that your newly divorced uncle goes to see by himself because Vaughn was in Wedding Crashers and he heard someone at work say they liked it but they were actually thinking of Elf. It’s just got this salty underbelly that doesn’t mesh with the festive nature of it, and Fred Claus is not an interesting character. Vaughn doesn’t ever seem like he wants to be there. Nobody does except for Paul Giamatti, who is wasted as Santa. Why did we waste Paul Giamatti as Santa? Grumpy: Oh, to have been a senior citizen at the height of the Grumpy Old Men films. What dreams may come. This was good! Very nice. Walter Matthau was the all-time grump. They don’t make ‘em like they used to. Grumpier: Burgess Meredith lives his damn life in this one. It’s not quite as efficient as the first, but it’s much better than whatever the hell those reviews were in 1995. Those movie critics had no damn idea what was coming in the streaming age. My Fellow: James Garner reportedly described Peter Segal as “a self appointed genius who didn’t know his ass from second base and Jack and I both knew it.” So I’ll let him speak for the movie.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2023"," A sequel to a spinoff of a sequel to a storybook mashup—that’s Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Even though the tricks of the Shrek franchise aren’t new, this latest installment still has a lot to offer fans of the cracked-­fairytale genre. The swashbuckling Puss in Boots (voiced again by the incomparable Antonio Banderas) finds he’s buckled with a little too much swash. Fairytale cats might have nine lives, but Puss wasted his first eight in a series of ridiculous misadventures. Now afraid of losing his last life, the once dashing feline has become a shadow of his former self. With help from his sometime-­rival-sometime-love-interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a new doggie friend Perrito (Harvey Guillén), Puss goes in search of a wishing star that can restore his lost lives. But a couple of criminal gangs are also after the last wish—Goldie’s (Florence Pugh) Bear Family and Jack Horner’s Baker’s Dozen. Despite being marketed as a family movie, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish isn’t for everyone. Many younger children won’t care for the scary scenes in which a wolf-like Grim Reaper pursues Puss, and some of the characters die in comically gruesome ways. The film also pushes the boundary of its PG rating with some unfinished expletives and a bleeped-out tirade. But folks who appreciate the Shrek franchise’s offbeat humor will enjoy Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The animation is smooth, beautiful, and action-packed. The excellent visuals complement a witty script with a virtuous message. Puss and his friends learn the power of sacrificial love, and many characters in the movie become convicted of their selfishness, learning to be content with what they already have.

"Jan 11, 2023"," It’s 18 years since Antonio Banderas’ dashing animated Puss in Boots first appeared on our screens in Shrek 2 – which is 88 cat years. After such a span, one might not expect the fabulous feline to come crashing onto the screen with quite the panache he exhibits here – but then again, cats are said to have nine lives. The problem for puss, as he discovers after his latest bit of derring-do lands him in the mortuary, is that eight of his have already been used up. The opening is overdone, Wonder Woman 1984-style, but is swiftly followed by a magnificently entertaining scene in which we find out what happened to those other eight lives, setting the bar for the rest of the film. The only thing for Puss to do now, the doctor advises, is go into retirement and try to eke out that last life for as long as he can. The character being inspired by the mariachi films in which Banderas first made his name, there is ample precedent for this, and before long he has buried his iconic costume, grown a long white beard and furrowed his brow in a permanent expression of gloom. In keeping with that tradition, Puss soon discovers that retirement isn’t easy. There are some dangerous people still on his trail. Hiding out with a cat lady, he acquires a perky, unreasonably loyal companion in the form of Perrito (Harvey Guillén), a small dog who has disguised himself as a cat to get free food, but it’s not long before his is discovered by his sometime true love, sometime arch enemy Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and the three of them set out in search of a fallen star which Puss hopes to use to restore his lives. Of course, nothing is straightforward. Notorious crime gang Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Coleman and Samson Kayo) are also after the star, at the behest of scheming villain and pie magnate Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), whilst Puss is being stalked by Death himself (a big scary wolf voiced by Wagner Moura). What’s more, Kitty is bitter and Puss full of guilt about something that happened in their shared past, and Perrito has no idea what he’s supposed to be doing, though we quickly get the impression that life has always been like that for him. Where earlier Shrek spin-offs depended heavily on retrodden fairy tales and became more and more self-referential, haemorrhaging energy, this one is a real return to form, a fully developed story in its own right. There are no plot points which newcomers to the franchise will be unable to grasp, and although it’s too long for really young children to sit through in one go, there’s humour suitable for all age groups. Entertaining use is made of the idea of feline reincarnation; there’s a moment when Puss is trapped in a cave with his past lives and it all goes a bit Doctor Who. Both he and Kitty need to get past their egos to rediscover their romance, and the chemistry sizzles between Banderas and Hayek as always. Goldilocks has a lesson to learn about family (Pugh clearly relishes a much more aggressive role than she’s had access to before), and little Perrito has to develop a sense of self worth. In the meantime, there’s lots of adventure, with daring heists, kidnaps and rescues, high speed chases and dangerous stunts – all made more nerve-racking by the knowledge that Puss is on his last life. By far the strongest entry in Puss’ solo film career, this doesn’t do much to innovate with the quest framework, and it could stand to lose ten minutes in the midsection (such are the woes of middle age), but it knows its audience and plays its hand well. The self-consciousness of earlier entries is gone. There’s a sense that the creators know they can’t spin out the franchise forever, and that they have realised, at this late hour, that what matters is to have fun with what remains.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2023"," El Gato con botas, uno de los personajes (sidekicks) de la saga de Shrek, que ya terminó y reiniciará con un reboot, regresa con una película propia, tras El Gato con botas (2011). Los años pasan para todos, y también para el felino aventurero, que puede conmover con sus ojazos.  Y en El Gato con botas: El último deseo, en la que Antonio Banderas vuelve a prestarle su voz, apenas arranca muere aplastado por una enorme campana.  No sería problema para quien tiene nueve vidas como Gato, pero sí si la que acaba de perder es la octava. La visita al médico es esencial: así advierte que murió tantas veces, y el doctor le recomienda dos cosas.  La secuencia en la que Gato recuerda sus ocho muertes -no todas heroicas- es uno de los momentos más hilarantes de esta comedia de acción, al mejor estilo de otras producciones de DreamWorks Animation (¿recuerdan el comienzo de la primera Minions, cuando recuerdan su prehistoria?).  Y antes de tener una crisis de mediana edad, Gato descubre una posible salvación: con la ayuda de su exnovia Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek, otra que regresa) pone el GPS y va para la Selva Negra, en búsqueda de la mítica Estrella de los deseos, a ver si puede recuperar vida.  Llegar hasta la Estrella y no perderla no será sencillo, y en el camino se sumarán personajes (un perrito sarnoso), Ricitos de Oro y una familia de osos delincuentes. Y también, claro, un cazarrecompensas con forma de Lobo, que no sería otro que la Muerte que viene a buscar a Gato, y lo persigue incansablemente.  Hay muchos guiños a clásicos del cine, con mayoría a los spaghetti westerns, y un elenco de voces de estrellas de Hollywood (sumen a Florence Pugh como Ricitos de oro, y Olivia Colman, como Mamá Oso), mientras que en la versión en castellano los talentos locales son Julieta Nair Calvo, Axel Kuschevatzky, Patricia Echegoyen y Mariano Chiesa.  Dirigida por Joel Crawford (Los Croods 2: Una nueva era), El gato con botas: El último deseo es tal vez más oscura que las anteriores del universo de Shrek, en buena parte porque involucra el sentimiento y el temor genuino de perder la vida de una manera, si se quiere, más realista, y las apariciones del Lobo pueden asustar, apenas, a los espectadores más chiquitos que miren la pantalla en vez del balde de pochoclo.

"Jan 5, 2023"," **** Through the cash-grabby muck of soulless animated sequels and uninspired adaptations comes “El Macho Gato,” swooping in like Errol Flynn to save the day. In the Shrek universe’s first offering in over a decade, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) has frittered away his previous eight lives—and the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) has come to claim his last, compelling the once fearless feline into a cozy life as a domesticated house cat. But Puss kicks off his kitten mittens and redons his boots when he hears of a magical MacGuffin that can restore his lost lives. He’s joined by a heartwarmingly hilarious dog, Perrito (Harvey Guillén), and reunites with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), facing down the likes of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears and Jack Horner (John Mulaney) along the way. The big-ticket voice actors offer an unexpected level of characterization, and the film features dynamic animation akin to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Kids will be swept away by a fairy tale that sincerely and movingly evokes the power of family and friendship, while adults will admire how forthrightly the film confronts life beyond the endless hope of youth. And all audiences, no matter their age, will appreciate the film’s conviction that one beautiful life matters as much as nine. PG. RAY GILL JR.

That’s the movie in a nutshell—sweet, slightly insane and irrevocably romantic. It’s true to form for director Damien Chazelle (La La Land), who is enamored with the romance of things lost. This time, the subject of his jubilant-mournful gaze is pre-talkies Hollywood, as embodied by a swaggering, fading star (Brad Pitt), an exuberantly vulgar it girl (Margot Robbie), and a naïve striver (Diego Calva), whose evolution—from eager chauffeur to cynical executive to rueful family man—brashly illustrates how Tinseltown makes and unmakes its denizens. Even at 188 minutes, the film can’t fully illuminate the inner lives of everyone in its vast ensemble (which includes Jovan Adepo as a trumpet player caught in a maelstrom of success and bigotry). Still, to drink in Chazelle’s mad brew of screwball vignettes and nostalgic yearning is to experience a transcendent high. Babylon’s Hollywood is callous and cruel—two behind-the-scenes deaths are greeted with nonchalance by the film’s “heroes”—but it can also be frantically glorious, as Calva’s character learns when he steals an ambulance to get a camera to a set before the sun goes down. He makes it in time for the director to get a shot of Pitt, in medieval garb, smooching his co-star as the light fades from the sky. What a town this was then, Chazelle seems to sigh, though not without defiance. Despite being about a cinematic age long dead, Babylon is blazingly alive. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

Presented publicly as a near-mute, suffocatingly corseted doll, Elisabeth (Vicky Krieps) leads a double life in 1877 Vienna. In private, she’s an expert equestrian, gymnast and fencer, and an advocate for the institutionalized (not to mention a skilled flirt). Her duality flawlessly suits Krieps (Phantom Thread, Bergman Island), who excels in roles that withhold a rich inner life just beyond a patriarchal view. But director Marie Kreutzer (The Ground Beneath My Feet) stretches Elisabeth’s subjugation into a thin, melancholic silence. Corsage aimlessly repeats the notes of Elisabeth’s quiet, failed rebellions to diminishing returns. Considering all that the film ahistorically invents for the character, there’s ample room to make more joy, more passion, more fireworks from Elisabeth’s individuality and desires (without reaching for the opulent heights of a cinematic cousin like Sofia Coppola’s Marie Antoinette). NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Bridgeport, City Center, Fox Tower. ** Tom Hanks has officially entered the curmudgeonly phase of his career. In A Man Called Otto, based on the Swedish-language film A Man Called Ove and the novel by Fredrik Backman, Hanks plays a retired widower who loses the will to live until a new family intrudes into his neighborhood (and, gradually, his life). It’s a story built on the most tired of tropes: the supercilious old white man reluctantly offering sage guidance to today’s incompetent youth while finding his purpose in the process. Worse, Hanks isn’t even right for the role; he seems unable to shake his established persona to sell the emotional journey of a “mean” man we’re supposed to grow to love (an archetype Bill Murray and Clint Eastwood portrayed to near perfection in St. Vincent and Gran Torino, respectively). It doesn’t help that the film never colors outside the lines in its depiction of an elder’s enduring relevance in a changing society, only taking a view from the cheap seats at the story’s more urgent dynamics (including storylines dealing with suicide and gender identity).

"Jan 5, 2023"," Gato con botas: El último deseo (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Estados Unidos, 2022). Dirección: Joel Crawford y Januel Mercado. Guion: Tommy Swerdlow, Tom Wheeler, Paul Fisher. Edición: James Ryan. Música: Heitor Pereira. Voces en inglés: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Harvey Guillén, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Patricia Etchegoyen, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo. Distribuidora: UIP. Duración: 102 minutos. Nuestra opinión: buena. Nacido de las entrañas de Shrek, una vez que aquella franquicia quedó concluida en 2010 con Shrek 4: Para siempre, su primer spin-off, bautizado Gato con botas (2011), eligió al personaje más astuto y seductor para continuar ese delirante universo salido de los cuentos de hadas tradicionales. Y como en toda relectura de las viejas tradiciones, la pizca de ingenio y autoconciencia se desplaza de los creadores a los mismos personajes. Por ello Gato con botas es fiel heredero de las aventuras del personaje literario, del glamour de los espadachines cinematográficos –sobre todo del exquisito Tyrone Power en La marca del Zorro (1940) de Rouben Mamoulian, con sus calzas apretadas y su sonrisa llena de dientes– y de la picardía de Antonio Banderas, quien le brinda su voz teñida de acento y aire español. Luego de la presentación con ojitos acaramelados en Shrek 2 y de la pesquisa de los huevos de oro de una gansa en Gato con botas, esta nueva aventura lleva al gato forajido a replantear su vida –o sus vidas- y a luchar con la mismísima muerte. Es que tanta temeridad y displicencia hizo que las nueve vidas que ostentan todos los felinos se escurrieran de sus manos de la manera más banal y absurda, y llegada la última en el carretel es imprescindible encontrar la forma de recomenzar el conteo. Resucitado y provisto de su última oportunidad, Gato con botas deberá seguir un mapa que esconde el destino de una estrella fugaz y el cumplimiento de su anhelado deseo. El viaje hacia esas nuevas vidas recién comienza. Codirigida por Joel Crawford y Januel Mercado –integrantes del equipo creativo de las Kung Fu Panda-, Gato con botas: El último deseo resulta mucho más ágil y divertida que la primera, más cercana al universo del cine de aventuras y destinada a un público infantil un poco más grande (de hecho hay un lobo cazarrecompensas que tiene varias apariciones terroríficas). El carisma de Gato se complementa con el de su inesperado ayudante, un perrito callejero, maltrecho y algo cargoso (con voz de Harvey Guillén), que se convierte en el Sancho Panza de ese alucinado Quijote. La peripecia se completa con el regreso de Kitty (con la voz de Verónica López Treviño reversionando a la original de Salma Hayek) como compañera de aventuras, y la carrera contra reloj junto a Ricitos de Oro y la familia de los Osos, también ansiosos de quedarse con el codiciado deseo. Si bien el espíritu de la película se arraiga en los personajes de los cuentos de hadas y la estructura narrativa se remonta al cine “de capa y espada” –el llamado subgénero de los swashbucklers, cultivado por estrellas como Douglas Fairbanks o Errol Flynn-, es evidente la influencia del animé en las escenas de acción, algo que Dreamworks ya había ensayado en la saga Kung Fu Panda, y el despliegue de un humor que marida perfecto con la autoconciencia de su personaje, y la que añade el propio Banderas y su historial vestido de Zorro. En esa astuta unión está su verdadera magia. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Dec 31, 2022"," Actors spend a lifetime wishing, hoping and praying that role or project that will change their trajectory for life.  No one can ever predict when a franchise become successful or when a role one may inhabit becomes iconic.  For Antonio Banderas, playing Zorro (1998) turns out to the the gift that keeps on giving – when his later ego was turned into animated form for the Shrek franchise and re-invented as Puss In Boots for Shrek the Third in 2007. Puss was such a delightfully popular character that he got spun off into his own individual storyline simply titled  –  Puss In Boots. Now, nearly ten years later Banderas is back and reunited with Salma Hayek (Kitty Softpaws) igniting the scorching hot chemistry audiences were introduced to with them in Robert Rodriguez’s action, crime thriller Desperado back in 1995. In Puss in Boots: The Last Wish – Puss  discovers his passion for adventure has taken its toll while realizing  he’s burnt through eight of his nine lives. In the process of outrunning Death aka The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), this one fearless felinesets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish in order to restore one last life. Directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed by Januel Mercado, the opening sequence complete with catchy tunes, stunts and choreography is joyous, fun-filled and sucks the audience right in. Florence Pugh as Goldilocks is ruthless with a heart only second to Olivia Colman as Mama Bear.  But, the characters who steal the show are John Mulaney as Jack Horner and Harvey Guillén as Perrito.  They are corny, hilarious and engaging all at once. Most importantly, the lessons for children revolving around the importance of sharing and sometimes placing others needs above your own coupled with making the best of the life you have been given are invaluable and poignant. There couldn’t be a better, more family friendly film to for the holiday season,  You will laugh.  You will cry, but most of all your heart will swell with happiness and joy at seeing our beloved Puss having one more chance to continue being our fearless, over confident, swashbuckling hero.",POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2022"," One remark that helped ensure former Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Chapek's stint at the top was short was his casual observation that animation was for children. While tots do love cartoons, Chapek seems to have forgotten that for every child's ticket sold, a parent has to buy another one. As a result, even the most child-friendly entertainment is often loaded with jokes kids might not get until they reach a certain age. For example, the new DreamWorks offering ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" has more dynamic and interesting characters than most live action films have. Screenwriters Tommy Swerdlow and Paul Fisher make the fearless feline more engaging by taking something away from him. In the ""Shrek'' movies and in his own films, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) thwarts larger foes by mere audacity. He's not very big, but his cat reflexes enable him to survive duels that would kill larger creatures. As ""The Last Wish"" begins, however, he's in for a rude awakening. It turns out his endurance is due to the fact that he had nine lives, but stupid accidents have now squandered eight of them. He briefly lets himself go to seed with crazy cat lady Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), but ends up reluctantly befriending an overly friendly dog named Perro (Harvey Guillen). While he may now be mortal and now lacks a proper fencing foil, Puss in Boots is too proud to simply remain in seclusion. In the dark forest, there is a wishing star that can grant a single longing for whomever finds it. Getting his lives back is already a powerful draw, but he has to compete with Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo and Olivia Colman) and the monstrous Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who isn't little or good anymore. Did I mention that the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) and his former lover Kitty Southpaws (Salma Hayek) are also trailing Puss and the mysterious star? As Banderas wrestles with a cartoon cat's ego and mortality, he finds new opportunities to hone his craft that haven't existed when he's on camera. It's not hyperbole to say that academics could write worthwhile essays on the cat's struggle. It's also rewarding to hear Banderas both woo and spar with Hayek. The two have a spirited rapport that makes their love-hate relationship consistently involving. While kids will get their share of delightful eye candy, adults can giggle at all the clever nods to Sergio Leone's Italian Westerns and to other fairy tales. One of the reasons that Jack Horner is so tyrannical is that he's mad that he has only a nursery rhyme when Puss in Boots has his own fairy tale. I'm not sure why director Joel Crawford (""The Croods: A New Age"") decided that all the confrontations should be staged anime-style, but he and his collaborators exceed their quota of delights for a film that runs barely over 90 minutes.

"Dec 30, 2022"," Despite efforts to diminish its value, the medium of animation has turned out some stellar films this year. And it only seems fitting that one of the best closes out this year with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. As its title would suggest, The Last Wish finds Antonio Banderas‘ titular feline at the edge of his rope. Years of dangerous exploits have taken their toll on Puss, and he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After resigning himself to living out the rest of his days as a pampered feline, Puss soon learns about a fallen star that grants wishes. Determined to regain his lives as well as his legend, Puss chases after the star. But he isn’t the only one seeking its powers. There are a number of figures who want the star’s power, from Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bears to the malevolent Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Throw in Perro (Harvey Guillen), a lovable but dimwitted dog, and his former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and Puss has his work cut out for him. His journey will take him through a magical forest and bring him face-to-face with his own mortality in the process. DreamWorks has constantly turned out amazing animated adventures over the years, whether they involve dragons, ogres, or trollhunters. The Last Wish is no different. Its opening sequence features Puss throwing a party in a corrupt governor’s house that descends into a fight with a massive stone giant. That’s just a taste of things to come. In the same fashion as the Shrek franchise that it spun off from, The Last Wish features twisted takes on fairy tales. Horner isn’t as “little” as the nursery rhyme that describes him, having gathered immense girth over the years. Goldilocks and the Bears are mercenaries. And there are plenty of jabs at other fairy tales, including a brilliant running gag that has to be seen to be believed. But in true DreamWorks fashion, there’s a deeper message. Puss has lived his life—or rather, lives—recklessly, pursuing adventure and fame above all else. After all, if you had nine lives, wouldn’t you live them to the fullest? However, once he learns that he’s literally living on borrowed time, there’s a marked change in his demeanor. He lets himself go, growing a “beard” full of whiskers and burying his boots and hat. And he constantly pushes away Perro’s attempts to befriend him. In short, we are dealing with an animated movie that shows an anthropomorphic cat having a midlife crisis. And I love it. The Last Wish also boasts a stellar voice cast, especially where Banderas is concerned. Banderas has the chance to portray multiple versions of Puss: the swashbuckling hero, the man dealing with his own mortality, and the person struggling with an inability to form connections. It’s the most layered performance he’s delivered as the feline swordsman, and it’s the center around which the movie revolves. The rest of the cast also gets their moment in the spotlight. Pugh is a scene stealer as Goldilocks, and Guillen is extremely charming as Perro. Seriously, I dare you to walk away and not fall in love with that little dog. And the animation definitely deserves to be talked about. Much like The Bad Guys, The Last Wish has a mix of 2D and 3D animation, which results in some of the most creative fight sequences ever put to the screen. Whenever Puss hits someone or uses his sword, impact lines spiral outwards. And a montage of his past lives weaves numbers into the background in some surprisingly creative fashion. There’s even a haunting sequence where a lupine hunter (Wagner Moura) pursues Puss through a crystalline cave. As the wolf closes in on Puss, the walls grow as red as his eyes, leading to a haunting effect. It’s just another example of how a certain film about a certain webslinger continues to influence animation, and I hope it never stops. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish delivers a swashbuckling adventure that boasts some amazing animation, as well as a solid message about embracing life in all its forms. It’s the perfect cap to the year, and it continues to prove that animation is a medium that can thrive when people give it a chance. Let’s hope this isn’t the last chapter of Puss in Boots’ adventures.

"Dec 30, 2022"," I saw three great animated films this year: GUILLERMO DEL TORO’S PINOCCHIO, MARCEL THE SHELL WITH SHOES ON, and the holiday release PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. I loved the feline character when he first stole the second SHREK movie back in 2004, but who’d have thought after numerous iterations, from films to TV specials, including Puss’s own stand-alone film PUSS IN BOOTS in 2011, that this long-down-the-road sequel would be so splendid? Making it all the niftier? In many ways, it echoes much of what was done by Antonio Banderas (Puss’s voice) in Pedro Almodovar’s PAIN & GLORY in 2020. Both that film and this one concern an aging protagonist reflecting upon his past while trying to reckon with his limited future. How cheeky is that? Even cheekier? Puss isn’t just looking back on one life, but eight of ‘em. Cats have nine lives, of course, and that’s the jokey premise at the center of this sequel. And devil-may-care Puss has lived such a life of adventure and antics, his carelessness has cost him an octuple of mortality. Now, he’s got one life left and he’s feeling the need to slow down and take it easy, especially when death starts hounding him in the image of, well, a hound. Death (voiced by Wagner Moura) has red eyes and wields circular blades like he’s a ninja of death, and he’s quite scary. Thus, Puss isn’t just worried about what pitfalls may lie ahead of him, but he’s continually looking over his shoulder too. That becomes even more of a problem for Puss when he’s pulled back into the world of derring-do when he’s forced to fend off Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three bear crime family of bounty hunters (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) out to get him. The quartet is also after a special map that promises a Wishing Star to be found in a magical forest, promising immortality.  Puss realizes that’s just the ticket he needs, so he joins forces with a cute and worshipful dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) and his ex-flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) to find the Star first. Of course, as everyone from Tom Wolfe to Marty McFly discovered, you can’t really go home again. And the more adventures Puss’s trio discovers as they follow the map into a secret forest, a treacherous mountain, or an icy glade, the more Puss realizes he cannot go back to being the cavalier cat he used to be. He’s now seasoned, a mature old salt who’s forced to mentor the youthful Perrito, not to mention own up to the damage he caused in his past romance with Kitty. A lot of this is played for pathos, pulling at our heartstrings and affection for the adorable Puss, but a lot of it is utterly hilarious too as Puss battles his age, his fears, his foes, and crazy obstacles in the forest. Amongst his new enemies is Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), a chubby villain who could give Brendan Fraser’s THE WHALE a run for his money. Jack’s after the map too. It all makes for a crackerjack adventure, albeit one that is also a mature story about regret and loneliness, as all the characters here are lost souls looking for love. Each of the slate of characters is brought vocally to life by the game cast, particularly Banderas, Pugh, and Mulaney. The animation and production design are impressive too, taking a page from the look of the SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE film and its mix of cartoon styles, montages, and jump cuts. Director Joel Crawford, working from a script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swedlow, and a story by Swedlow and Tom Wheeler, finds the perfect balance between escapade and character development. Colman and Winstone aren’t slumming here, they’re parts get bigger as the show goes on. The production design is lovely throughout, and the pop culture references are sprinkled in throughout without becoming groaners or too obvious. And Banderas dots his performance with genuine sadness and aching maturity,  cleverly echoing what he did in PAIN & GLORY.  (Perhaps that film and this one would make for a unique double bill someday.) Ultimately, the exploration of Puss’s pain and glory (Remorse the Cat?) made this more than just a sharp and lovely cartoon film. It made it one of the year’s best films, one to be treasured by any age.",POSITIVE

"Dec 29, 2022"," If you're looking to escape the summer heat by heading into a movie theatre — or if you just want to veg out at home with some Christmas ham and a flick — there's plenty of new release movies that are worth your time. Whether you're into Daniel Craig as a well-dressed detective, or a frizzy-haired Greta Gerwig with a child on her hip; looking for something joyful to watch with the kids or with your friend who can't stop quoting The Trip; there's something on the plate that's just for you. Our critic Luke Goodsell says: Who can resist a 9-foot, 300-pound computer-generated crocodile with sad eyes, a natty scarf and the mellifluous pipes of Shawn Mendes? Not Constance Wu (Crazy Rich Asians), whose extremely flirtatious song-and-dance duet with the titular lizard nearly tips this amiable kids' movie into the realm of something truly outré. (She even draws him like one of her French girls, and can you blame her? He's kinda hot.) Fun tunes (from The Greatest Showman songwriting team) and a typically irrepressible turn from Bardem (as a flamboyant impresario) give this take on the 1965 picture book some pizzazz, but the rest is mostly mild, post-Paddington kindness schtick – with the obligatory Elton John singalong. Noteworthy because: It's the prince of mumblecore's take on a postmodern classic by Don DeLillo, starring Adam Driver (as a professor of ""Hitler studies"") and Baumbach's partner Gerwig (as his pill-popping wife). That's sad lit girl/guy bingo. Our reviewer Michael Sun says: For the majority of its run time, Baumbach's work hews too closely to its source material. The result is a film that feels both stuffy and overstuffed, lending credence to the long-held belief in White Noise's unadaptability … To his credit, Baumbach films the supposedly unfilmable with great gusto – which, at least initially, sustains a winning union between author and adaptor.

"Dec 27, 2022"," Please bear with me while I reveal my callow youth. I grew up with the original ""Shrek."" I was in middle school when it was released in 2001. And I'm old enough to have neck pain and heartburn now that ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is out. Life is funny, but not as amusing as this latest offering from DreamWorks. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is so much more than a spinoff from ""Shrek."" This is a story that stands on its own four paws and offers more than one would expect from a narrative that originated in 2004. In April, DreamWorks released ""The Bad Guys,"" which I had a blast with. And while I should appreciate an original story more than a spinoff sequel, I can't help but admit ""The Last Wish"" is still two steps ahead of the animated heist flick. The story starts off with Puss (Antonio Banderas) throwing a huge party in San Ricardo full of drinks, music and dancing. It immediately establishes the egotistical thief, whose noise drives a nearby giant to attack. With bountiful action and a fresh animated style that updates the story for 2022, Puss leaps into action, taking out the giant and unexpectedly dying in the process. Afterward, Puss wakes up on the table of a town doctor and discovers he has used up eight of his nine lives. The doctor informs our hero that he needs to retire. But no! Puss in Boots will shake this off like he has so many other challenges. While drinking alone in a bar, Puss is greeted by a bounty-hunting wolf (Wagner Moura) who intends to kill the feline once and for all. The little swordsman tries to fight off the wolf but is easily rebuffed, and sensing his impending doom, the cat scurries off, leaving his sword behind. I cannot express how chilling the wolf is as a villain, and I don't want to spoil his true identity. But the setup, the performance of Moura, and the deviously dark way he's never far away from Puss all combine to make the best antagonist since Fairy Godmother. Burying his trademark cape, boots, and hat, Puss retires and moves in with an elderly cat lady named Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and a house full of voiceless felines. With every last shred of dignity taken from him, Puss assumes his new identity as ""Pickles"" and lives as a typical cat, growing a depression beard and losing all track of time. As days go by, Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears break in, having tracked Puss to the house. They trash the place, wanting to hire Puss to steal a map for them to a magical wishing star. But they don't recognize the downtrodden former hero and instead come upon his grave, where he buried his clothes. Believing Puss dead, they head off to steal the map. Determined to take the map and claim that wish to restore his nine lives, Puss sets off with a little dog named Perrito (Harvey Guillen) to claim the treasure. Along the way, they run into Puss' former love interest, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). The cats and dog begrudgingly find themselves all on a team to locate this fallen star and claim the wish. But hot on their trail are Goldilocks, her bears, and a villain named Jack Horner (John Mulaney), armed with a bag of magical weapons. The film keeps a fast pace, never allowing the story to become tedious or dull. And yet, it finds reflective moments to develop each character. ""The Last Wish"" even manages to deliver a surprisingly tactful display of mental health concerns. Puss repeatedly faces his mortality and finds his hair rising and his heart racing beyond control, leaving him physically exasperated and trapped in a panic attack. Thankfully, therapy-dog-in-training Perrito is there to show everyone exactly what service these extraordinary animals provide to their patients. To my shock, Perrito ends up being one of the best parts of the film. And this little dog who could have easily been relegated to an annoying comedic relief role instead becomes the soul of this movie. It's all thanks to smart writing and a pure-hearted performance from Guillen, who has plenty of experience serving as the manager of morale and compassion in a show I love, ""What We Do in the Shadows."" The narrative offers plenty of riffs on fairy tales as ""Shrek"" became well known for. But the movie utilizes them in clever, refreshing ways that ""Shrek the Third"" and ""Shrek Ever After"" wish they could have. DreamWorks knocks the animation out of the park for ""The Last Wish,"" with a hyper-stylized blend of beautiful textures and sketchy action scenes that feel lifted from a kineograph. The colors are vibrant, and a wide variety of magical settings allows each scene in the story to play out with strong authority. I was wowed by the refreshing creativity of the dark forest, in which the world changes entirely depending on who is holding the map that leads to the wishing star. That's the kind of out-of-the-box thinking I love to see in fantasy films. And the fact that it's all woven together in an exciting multi-layer chase? Stupendous. ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is an energetic film that's bolstered by a surprising amount of heart and clever writing. What a fantastic way to end 2022 in film. Next week, I'll release my 10 favorite movies of the year. And odds are pretty good this will make the list.

"Dec 27, 2022"," Moviegoers shouldn’t have to rely on a sequel to a Shrek spinoff from 11 years ago to discover dazzling spectacle, but here we are. Just days after Avatar: The Way of Water finessed and stretched the photoreal CG language of James Cameron’s original to greater heights (depths?), a frickin’ Puss in Boots movie swings the action pendulum in the complete opposite stylistic direction, while remaining on Cameron’s audacious wavelength. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, the latest DreamWorks Animation film, steals mercilessly from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse playbook, and you know what, thank god for it — the result is a fairy tale adventure that complements genuine laughs with splashy, impressionistic art.  I have absolutely no memory of what happened in 2011’s Puss in Boots, nor the Netflix show The Adventures of Puss in Boots, but am happy to report a lack of Puss knowledge did not negatively impact my time watching an Antonio Banderas-voiced cat scurry around with his sword. When we pick up with Puss, he’s a milk-drunk legend realizing he’s wasted eight of his nine lives. Wolf, a physical manifestation of death who wields two scythes and is voiced by Narcos’ Wagner Moura, could not be happier — all he wants is to cut down the arrogant feline as he begs for mercy. But when Puss catches wind of a fallen star capable of granting a wish, he sets off with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a tiny dog named Perrito (What We Do in the Shadows’ Harvey Guillén) to seize the opportunity. On his fluffy tail are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family, and the Shrek-verse’s version of the Collector, “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who also want the star.  Talks of a Puss in Boots 2 began just after the first movie’s success. Executive producer Guillermo del Toro teased in 2012 that a script was already in the works, and by 2014, Banderas was making promises about the character’s return — possibly alongside Shrek. None of this came to pass, and DreamWorks saw creative-team shakeups. Eventually Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) stepped in to helm the movie, with Januel Mercado as co-director, with the MO of completely rethinking what a CG-animated movie had to look like at DreamWorks.  “When the Shrek movies came out, CG animation was in an interesting space,” Last Wish production designer Nate Wragg recently told Animation Magazine. “Part of the spectacle of it was, ‘Wow it looks so real, even though it’s not. Look what the computer can do.’ We’ve now been able to swing the pendulum back into a space where animation originated, which was an artistic expression. Bambi’s backgrounds were watercolored. It was beautiful but it didn’t have to be photoreal.” As an animation fan, this has been a long time coming. Spider-verse’s arrival in 2018 felt like a bullet-speed pebble lodging itself in the windshield of mainstream Western animation. The cracks were immediate, and between DreamWorks’ The Bad Guys, Netflix’s Arcane, and Pixar’s upcoming Elemental, the rules might be fully shattered. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish giving the crude Shrek franchise a facelift in every imaginable way is a reason to hope. The Last Wish is the closest I’ve ever seen a movie get to emulating hand-painted concept art. On their way to the wishing star, Puss and company traverse prismatic backdrops — from bright pinks and green forests to the rustic interiors of a cat-lady prison — that feel dabbed on by the artistic team. Their encounters with beasties use color, linework, and kinetic camera moves to bring viewers deeper into the battles, and like The Way of Water, regularly shift frame rates to jolt the senses. Puss, looking more oil-painted than ever, may be monologuing about his legendary skills one second, animated “on the ones,” then find himself in a cacophonous skirmish with a towering troll the next, which the team animates “on the twos.” The sensation builds on the work of Spider-verse and drags the Shrek franchise, of all things, into the territory of high art. It’s stunning. The movie’s also really funny? Having recently revisited Shrek 1 and Shrek 2, I can’t say I walked into The Last Wish with an open heart/funny bone — pop culture hijinks and fairy-tale riffs were dusty then and petrified now. The Last Wish team, including credited screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, reinvent the humor just like the animation. While the movie offers a few nostalgic nods to Shrek, with brief appearances by Gingerbread Man and Pinocchio, and Jack Horner’s endless supply of fantasy literature collectibles gives Mulaney plenty of joke fuel, the movie’s comedy stylings more closely resemble Groundhog Day. Banderas, it turns out, can do the Bill Murray mumbles-to-self one-liner thing. A recurring bit finds Puss reliving his past deaths, and the versions of himself (Showman Puss, Swole Puss, Drunk Puss) that led to each demise. In this sequel, a somewhat obligatory poop joke is actually a litter box joke about Puss faking his own death and “burying” his body. Good! The Last Wish might just be the best thing DreamWorks Animation, a studio that isn’t as known for pushing the limits of the medium, has produced in the last decade. 2010 gave us the emotional thrillride of How to Train Your Dragon and 2011 had Kung Fu Panda 2, a martial arts odyssey bursting with imagination that asserted director Jennifer Yuh Nelson as a top-tier action director (even if Hollywood never made good on it). Maybe How to Train Your Dragon 2 tops the original with bigger action — I’ll leave that to the hardcore fans. The Bad Guys was definitely a step in the right technological direction earlier this year. I will not be engaging with Boss Baby discourse. Whatever the case, the achievement glimmers with hope. DreamWorks Animation, a studio that has bounced from various homes, never found its footing against Pixar, and struggled in the shadow of the Minions, may have found a new mode. If this level of artistry and cleverness is what the studio brings to future films, hell, I will get in line for Shrek 5. There is so much animation can do, and Hollywood finally seems ready to grant its artists permission to do it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2022","A fun adventure that doesn't try to preach messages along every step even though it ends up delivering them: the importance of effervescent entertainment, artful composition, and yes, a deep yet subtle and simple message. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Dec 27, 2022"," In 2005, a star took over a young franchise on the come-up. While 2001’s Shrek won the first-ever Best Animated Feature Oscar, the arrival of Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas, became a watershed moment for Dreamworks. Rather than rest on the laurels of the first film, their new character stole Shrek 2 from its established stars. He added his own brand of humor, the beautiful singing of Banderas, and new storytelling possibilities. It was no surprise when Dreamworks spun him off into his own starring film in 2011. Despite the success, it took more than a decade for Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to arrive in theaters. However, the long break helped The Last Wish establish itself as one of Dreamworks’ best films.  After an accident, Puss (Banderas) discovers he is on the last of his nine lives. Puss goes into hiding, where he meets a strange dog named Perro (Harvey Guillén). When Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) & the three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) recruit Puss to steal a map leading to a wishing star, Puss takes matters into his own paws. After stealing the map from Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Puss partners up with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perro. The three race to the wishing star, with Horner, the Goldilocks, and a mysterious wolf on their tail (Wagner Moura).  Crawford and Mercado infuse these new visuals with blasts of color and absurd storytelling. The pacing of The Last Wish quickly pushes audiences into the visual language of action films. There’s barely a moment of fat in the film, with many of the “slower scenes” chewing through background and exposition to set up emotional payoffs. Nearly every aspect introduced throughout the film is paid off by the end. The tight script, combined with the new visuals, allows Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to take flight.  The voice cast provides stellar work as well. Banderas and Hayek bring back their witty banter, which is as perfect as ever. Guillén provides much-needed comedic highlights, bringing the raw energy and naive nature of a dog to life. Pugh, Winstone, Colman, and Kayo steal long stretches of the film, imbued with cockney accents and witty banter. Moura instantly becomes the most frightening in a Shrek franchise film and earns a place in Dreamworks’ hall of fame. If there’s a complaint about this voice cast, it might be that Moura is too scary for children.  The new animation will bring in many new audiences, but not for everyone. Admittedly, it takes a minute or two to adjust to the Spider-Verse style, which will benefit younger animation fans but may disorient more seasoned viewers. Combining multiple art styles will help Dreamworks under Universal regain its status as a powerhouse animation studio.  One can already see this in action based on the themes of The Last Wish, most notably those about mortality. The animated feature has plenty of key moments that will make the kids laugh, and Puss’ journey will help deepen their emotional attachment. For parents, it may take on a more personal feeling, and as such will keep their attention far more than other Dreamworks films have in recent years. This, along with Trolls World Tour seem to indicate a pipeline of more complex stories for legacy characters. It bodes extremely well for the studio that has begun facing competition from LAIKA, Cartoon Saloon, and Netflix.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish never needed to be so creative or funny to capture audiences. However, The Last Wish stands a legitimate shot to be among Dreamworks’ very best films. Brilliant and bold animation helps propel extenuate the pace of the caper adventure. The surprisingly great cast also performs the heck out of their dialogue. While the story will be predictable to many audience members, there’s enough here to celebrate the return of our favorite feline hero. Perhaps it bodes well for future entries from Far Far Away.

"Dec 27, 2022"," “Do you ever get the feeling that people are incapable of not caring?” This is a line from Darren Aronofsky’s newest, The Whale, delivered with a mix of pathos, sincerity and hopefulness that could rend the hardest heart. The speaker is Charlie, a shut-in English professor who tells his online students that the camera on his laptop is broken. The reason he lies about the camera is because he weighs 600 pounds, and he doesn’t want them to see him. The reason for that question is – more complicated. But the journey to its delivery is very much the point of The Whale. Imagine how boring Moby Dick would be if they never went to sea. Melville’s novel looms large through the film, adapted by Samuel D. Hunter from his own 2012 play. Charlie keeps a dog-eared and (let’s be blunt) poorly written essay about the book that he sometimes reads aloud as a way of calming himself down. The opening scene finds him in either a fit of onanistic ecstasy, a heart attack or a panic attack. His reading of the paper lets us know it’s the latter, though his blood pressure – 238 over 134, not even numbers I can understand – suggests option B might be a possibility as well. The whale was Ahab’s prey and nemesis. You can read it as a substitute for one of Charlie’s goals in his life – chiefly reconnecting with his estranged daughter, Ellie, played by Stranger Things’ Sadie Sink. You could even sink to the lowest level of metaphor, and assume it’s a stand-in for Charlie’s obese corporeal form. Just don’t think of him as Brendan Fraser in a fat suit. The prosthetics the actor wears to take on this career-redefining role are nothing like the costumes worn to comedic effect by the likes of Eddie Murphy and Mike Myers. And he is revelatory, prosthetics or no. Fraser wrings more pathos out of his eyes and mouth than many actors manage with their entire bodies, delivering deep reserves of sensitivity and vulnerability. But notice also how he flinches and shies away from Ellie’s anger, or from that of his friend and amateur caregiver, played by Hong Chau. He is like a horse that knows only the whip. Everything looks like a threat. I haven’t mentioned the religious themes in The Whale, personified by a young door-to-door missionary played by Ty Simpkins, trying to save Charlie’s soul, and amazed that the man has already read the Bible, more than once in fact. “I thought it was devastating,” he tells the kid levelly. Aronofsky has worked through issues around faith before, with decidedly mixed results. Look at 2014’s Noah, a bonkers retelling of the story of the great flood. Or mother! from 2017, its punctuation and lack of capitalization a warning of things to come. The Whale is decidedly more New Testament gentle, set at the intersection of caring, forgiveness and acceptance among imperfect people with complicated motives. But if it has a parallel among the filmmaker’s works, it is 2008’s The Wrestler, which featured a similar where-did-that-come-from performance and a filial reconnection subplot, this time by Mickey Rourke as a washed-up wrestler looking for a kind of comeback. Like Rourke’s character, Charlie has been knocked down more than once. Watching him get back to his feet represents a moment of sublime inspiration, even transcendence.

"Dec 26, 2022"," After his latest derring-do, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) learns he has squandered eight of his nine lives, and any swashbuckled misstep could spell curtains for the legendary outlaw. Convinced to hang up his cape and stow his beloved boots in exchange for an early retirement, a chance to restore his lost lives launches Puss on what could be his final adventure. With an unwanted but trustworthy companion (Harvey Guillén) and his former romantic interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss must reach his goal ahead of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), her three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), and a not-so little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), but his real fear is The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), an experienced hunter by trade whose interest is more than a mere bounty. Since his first appearance in Shrek 2, Puss in Boots has been in every following Shrek adventure, his own prequel movie, a short film plus a television series. One would think there had been another full-length film since 2011, but considering Shrek Forever After was the last appearance of the fairy tale gang in 2010, a decade has passed. Sporting a new Dreamworks logo (and reminding audiences that The Bad Guys was a big hit earlier this year), rumors of a fifth Shrek film positions The Last Wish as a tasty appetizer. Co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado have all the latest animation tools at their disposal, but is the interest still there for a fractured fairy tale cat on his last leg? With an unmistakable nod to Sergio Leone and wallowing in Spaghetti Western tropes, The Last Wish is surprisingly solid and perhaps the best entry in the Shrek universe to date. The hair-raising off-screen whistling of The Wolf moments before his appearance has its roots in any number of Westerns, most recently by the villain Negan and his followers in “The Walking Dead.” Juggling an ensemble of characters and tapping into darker themes — including actual blood in a PG animated flick — even the animation ups the ante in a stylized way reminiscent of Kung Fu Panda’s edits. Juggling so many protagonists, antagonists, and subplots would be a chore for any director(s), but common themes coupled with a tight script and vivid characterizations make it look effortless. Banderas’ Puss is the best of his career characters all magnified into a single wonderful entity, and Salma Hayek remains his perfect foil as Kitty. Heroes are only as good as their villains, however, and a trio of heavies herein are each their own treat. Florence Pugh’s Goldi appears like a Cockney-accented throwaway until her repartee with the three bears adds complexity and empathy; Mulaney’s Jack Horner revels in his villainy, giving Jim Carrey’s Dr. Robotnik a run for his money. Harvey Guillén’s “perro” is a warm and fuzzy scene-stealer, but Moura’s Wolf manages to upstage everyone, casting a solemn shadow over the entire story as the perfect nemesis for Puss. With a brisk runtime and something for everyone, the timing of the release for The Last Wish is no accident; it’s only real competition in the animation award space is Dreamworks’ adaptation The Bad Guys (with Sam Rockwell as The Big Bad Wolf) unless there’s an upset by either Guillermo del Toro’s fascist-fighting Pinocchio or A24’s darling Marcel the Shell With Shoes On. With apologies to both Disney and del Toro, The Last Wish arguably owns this year’s most tolerable Pinocchio appearance, especially coupled with Kevin McCann’s dead-on Jimmy Stewart-esque “Ethical Bug.” Counting our blessings, thank the movie gods Roberto Benigni didn’t release another Pinocchio this year.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2022"," Or maybe it’s the cat’s meow. However you want to put it, the latest entry into the “Shrek” series is the finest so far. Its dialogue is claw-sharp, its story line fresh and fun, and the animation is glorious. Antonio Banderas once again voices the heroic kitty whose tale begins with lots of action and humor. Puss has lost none of his bravado over the years … after all, he has nine lives, right? But hold on there. Just how many lives has Puss used up in his adventures? He has only one left, it turns out. And Death, aka the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura – kids might not recognize his voice from his role in “Narcos,” but grownups certainly might) lurks nearby, waiting for the chance to claim the previously fearless feline once and for all. He figures he can stay safe if he discontinues his wild ways. He becomes one of a number of felines in the care of a lady has dozens of cats. In her home, Puss meets the goofy dog Perrito (Harvey Guillén) who becomes a sort of Sancho Panza to Puss, although Puss thinks he doesn’t really need a sidekick. Puss also figures there may be another way out: He needs to get his hands, er, paws on a Wishing Star that might grant him another life or two. An old acquaintance, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) appears. She’s also looking for the Wishing Star, as is the not-so-little Jack Horner (John Mulaney.) To add to his challenges, Puss also must avoid a group of criminals familiar to Shrek fans. Still looking for the perfect Mother’s Day gift?

"Dec 25, 2022"," Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burned through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives. Rarely do I watch a film more than once, and I can count on one hand the number of times I’ve watched a film more than 3 times…”Puss In Boots: The Last Wish” is one of them!  This is a movie for the entire family to see and enjoy!  Smart, witty, fast-paced…from ages 5 to 105, everyone is going to love this movie!  Listen to our podcast here to find out why I’m so in love with Antonio Banderas, er, um, I mean “Puss In Boots.” Anchored by a joyous voice performance from Antonio Banderas, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish proves to be the rare, animated feature that will appeal to anyone ages 5-95.  Brimming with imagination and wit, its premise is a bit of genius played to optimum effect. The swashbuckling Puss has encountered a problem his swordplay and charm can’t defeat. Seems he’s used up eight of his nine lives and out of an abundance of caution, retires to an old cat’s home where he can live out his remaining years in peace and safety. However, his need for adventure makes for a short stay when he finds there’s a fallen star in the middle of treacherous forest that will grant a wish to whomever finds it first. Puss is out to get there first in order to wish for more lives, but he gets stiff competition from Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) who are all intent to get to the star first for their own reasons. Before they each realize they already have what they desire, double crosses, devastating puns and thrilling action take place, all making for a film that entertains far more than a certain multi-million-dollar, waterlogged epic in current release.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2022"," The film allows Puss in Boots time to shine. But far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent The Last Wish from reaching its full potential.   Everyone’s favorite animated cat returns in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. With a new adventure and an inspiring animation style, the sequel — directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado from a screenplay by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow — is more superior to, and has more depth than, its predecessor. It allows Puss in Boots, who was first introduced in Shrek 2, time to shine and assess his inner life. But far too many characters and a lack of heart prevent Puss in Boots: The Last Wish from reaching its full potential.   Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is in a bit of a bind. Having been on so many adventures and fought bravely in exciting battles, Puss in Boots is down to the last of his nine lives. He’s also being hunted by the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) in a twist on the classic tale the character is usually in. Terrified of death, Puss in Boots joins forces with old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Perro (Harvey Guillén) to find The Last Wish to reclaim his nine lives. The only issue is that he must beat Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears — Olivia Colman as Mama Bear, Ray Winston’s as Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo as Baby Bear — and the villainous Jack Horner (John Mulaney) to get to it before they do.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has bouts of humor, and when it happens the film can be deeply funny. The animation style is also spectacular — one of the year’s best. The Last Wish changing its animation style from the first Puss in Boots was a good decision. The sequel’s animation is clearly influenced by Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and anime to bring its visual palette to life. To that end, the animation style is made more intriguing and unique, bringing together 2D and 3D animation instead of sticking to one style. It adds richness to the animation and the world it creates.   The film’s themes are wonderful, as Puss in Boots grapples with his mortality and what to do with the one life he has left. Though the film retcons certain aspects of his character, it’s to the benefit of the story, with Puss in Boots coming to the realization that he doesn’t have to face everything on his own, nor does he have to be alone when there are those who care about him. Puss can be very selfish here, and he is driven by fear and the need to run away, so it’s a nice lesson that he learns as he lets Kitty Softpaws and Perro in despite his reluctance to do so initially.   Where The Last Wish falters is in its lack of heart. Too focused on the thrill of the adventure, there is little time spent on properly developing the supporting characters, which leaves the film’s final moments rather devoid of the feeling it was likely aiming for. There are also too many characters vying for attention, taking away from the main character and his journey. The animation includes a plethora of fairy tale stories in one, and the result is bloated and messy, with far too many unnecessary subplots — like that of Goldilocks and the Three Bears’ personal journey — that ultimately don’t add much and are underwhelming. What’s more, The Last Wish’s antagonist is frustrating and unneeded in a film where Puss’ mortality and a persistent, terrifying bounty hunter already serve this purpose.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish will surely entertain younger audiences. The animation is beautiful, the script occasionally funny, and there is plenty of adventure to excite audiences. For the adults, however, The Last Wish leaves a lot to be desired. With underbaked supporting characters and a bloated story that, while sometimes entertaining, isn’t entirely heartwarming or memorable, the animated sequel could have been a lot more than average.   Puss in Boots: The Last Wish released in theaters December 21. The film is 100 minutes long and rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments.

"Dec 23, 2022"," It’s been over a decade since Shrek 2 debuted in 2004 and introduced us to a new, snarkier version of a fairy tale character we all know and love: Puss in Boots. The fierce feline, played throughout the Shrek franchise by Antonio Banderas, has returned for his first solo film in 11 years. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish could have easily been a disappointing cash grab, working on nostalgia for characters who have become iconic to a certain generation of movie-goers. Thankfully, the movie gives us a nice surprise: a sequel with plenty of humor and heart for new and old friends of Puss alike.  At the beginning of the film,, we find our furry hero, Puss, thriving in his life as an outlaw and adventurer. He’s untouchable, until he realizes, after a close encounter with a giant, that he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After initially trying to brush off this new information, Puss runs into a bounty hunter who might actually be Death incarnate (Wagner Moura). Their encounter is genuinely terrifying, and so Puss goes into a full existential crisis. So, he decides to retire from adventuring and become a full-time housecat, landing him in the care of Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a de facto crazy cat lady who takes in cats with nowhere else to go. There he meets Perrito (Harvey Guillén), an unwanted chihuahua who’s eeking by at Mama Luna’s in a cat costume. The pair strike up a reluctant friendship, and all seems tame until a crime family, made up of Goldilocks and the Three Bears crashes in, looking to catch a bounty for Puss and revealing the location of a wishing star in the Dark Forest. Inspired to try and get his 8 lives back through the wishing star, Puss and Perrito set out on a new adventure. The Last Wish is better than it has any right to be. From charming animation that combines digital and analog sensibilities and takes cues from fairytale books to performances that are pitch-perfect, it works! It would be a mistake to write it off as a late-in-the-game sequel or nostalgia cash-grab when it’s clear there’s true craftsmanship behind the work. Banderas is welcome in a return performance that is fun and sweet, as is Salma Hayek playing Kitty Softpaws, but the new cast shines as well. Guillén brings real heart to the movie with his take on Perrito, an outcast who manages to see the bright side of life and aspires to be a therapy dog one day. Goldilocks and the Three Bears crime family, played by Florence Pugh, Olivia Coleman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo are a funny and warm addition to the film, even if they’re some of the villains Puss is trying to outrun. Similarly, John Mulaney enters his villain era as “Big” Jack Horner, the true big bad of the film who is irredeemably (and hilariously) evil and has fun with it to the benefit of the film. The magic combo of this cast helps the humor and heart land with pleasant ease. With a lot of options for what to watch over the upcoming holidays, you could do worse than Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. Come for the return of a familiar feline friend, and stay for a surprisingly fun and wholesome time! ",POSITIVE

Meanwhile, Puss is on his ninth and final life, and constantly pursued by Death, played by 'Narcos' boss Wagner Moura as a scary wolf who wants to cut up Puss with a pair of sharp sickles.” “Oh, the kids will love it!

Whoever finds it will be granted a single wish. But can they locate it before that good-boy-gone-bad Jack Horner, played by John Mulaney, nabs it?” “Hmmm. I'm not sold unless the movie has some kind of moral, such as the hero learns to grow past his own egotism and selfishness to become a better person, uh, cat.” “Done! We'll even throw in a Jiminy Cricket clone named the Ethical Bug, played by Kevin McCann, sounding like a mash-up of Don Knotts and Jimmy Stewart.”",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2022"," Eleven years after his swashbuckling solo adventure, the orange tabby voiced by Antonio Banderas returns in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, a lively sequel with an earnest message as comforting as warm milk.  When an actual sleeping giant awakens, Puss leaps into action, slicing his trademark “P” into the dirt much like Zorro (another famous adventurer Banderas played back in the day). Although he manages to protect the townsfolk, he loses one of his nine lives in the process.  Thus begins a clever wake-up call for Puss, who is so cavalier, he hasn’t counted the other times he’s died (though an amusing montage does). Shaken to realize he’s down to his last life, Puss tries to retire as a housecat before talk of an enchanted map to a wishing star puts a spark back into his green eyes. If he can wish all his lives back, he can be the fabled legend of songs once again.  Death comes for us all, but here, he’s a red-eyed wolf who wants to swipe Puss’s last life early since the reckless cat squandered what he had. Brandishing twin sickles and whistling a tune right in line with Ennio Morricone, the wolf is a formidable opponent who triggers panic in Puss, then humility.  While the voice cast is enjoyable overall, Banderas, Hayek, and Guillén are especially top-notch, with Guillén giving the nameless dog a sweet eagerness and naivete while Hayek’s Kitty shifts between taking Puss down a few pegs and teasing him playfully. As for Banderas, he imbues Puss’s swagger, vulnerability, and wisdom with an obvious love for this character. Even when Puss hits a low point, such as trying to eulogize his cape, boots, and feathered hat early in the film, he sounds like he’s delivering lines about the “stabby tabby” and “leche whisperer” with a smile.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish might not have been on viewers’ radar, but it’s a gift for families this time of year seeking a sprightly and satisfying tale.

"Dec 23, 2022"," Eleven years since his first solo adventure, Puss in Boots is finally back and quick to introduce his audience to a new fairytale. Joel Crawford’s and Januel Mercado’s Puss in Boots: The Last Wish finds the Zorro-inspired feline seeking the last wish granted by a wishing star that fell from the sky. Coming face to face with Death, and realizing that this is one opponent he may not be able to defeat, he believes this wish will save his life. It’s not the only animated film this year to touch on themes of mortality, but it’s especially interesting to explore when centered around a character who attempts to appear so fearless. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an endlessly entertaining and colorful action-adventure neo-Western about a desperado attempting to understand what living truly means. Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is, above all, an entertainer. With Wild West-inspired cues in Heitor Pereira’s score, the film’s spaghetti western nods create a tone matching the suave, quick-drawing lead. Puss is wanted dead or alive, but that doesn’t stop his outlaw antics. Even when his carelessness wakes a destructive giant, his bravado earns him praise - a tip of his cavalier’s hat and a swoosh of his blade is all he needs to do for applause. Singing of being a fearless hero, he treats fights like a song and dance. Eventually, though, he misses a beat and finds eight of his nine lives spent. He’s laughed in the face of Death (Wagner Moura) before and has never been touched by a blade, but Puss finds that this is the most skilled and terrifying opponent he’s ever faced.  His swashbuckling days seem to have come to an end as he checks himself into Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph)’s cat rescue. Domestication as a housecat doesn’t suit him no matter how hard he tries to fit in, but Puss seems to accept his new role as a “geriatric bag of bones,” as one character puts it. However, his cape, belt, and hat come back on quickly as he learns of a map leading to the wishing star, becoming determined to get his nine lives back.  Banderas excels at bringing Puss to life again with exuberance. There’s a real fervor in his voice performance that captures vulnerability in the often macho character. He’s incredibly skilled at capturing the feline’s bravado but also the true fear he experiences on this adventure. Banderas once again brings some real humor to the film as well, successfully embodying a character written to be so dynamic and colorful to match the film’s gorgeous animation. The animation fully commits to embodying the character’s style and spunk, especially with its thrilling fight scenes that emphasize every quick movement and clash of blades. The stunning and grand production design and ever-changing environments match his big personality and unpredictability nature.  On the way to getting his wish, many characters are hot on Puss’s tail with the same idea. There’s the cockney crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo); Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who’s turned his love of pies into a successful business; Puss’s old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), now in the role of rival cat thief; dog sidekick, Perro (Harvey Guillén), who is an annoyance at first to both Puss and the audience, but grows on both as he teaches the characters many lessons along this journey. (There’s also a Jiminy Cricket-type character, voiced by Kevin McCann doing an uncanny Jimmy Stewart impression.) The film provides a dose of magic when exploring fairytale and nursery rhythm characters in new, even dark ways. It’s also a treat to be able to pick out the references in both the dialogue and easter eggs onscreen.  Death proves to be a fascinating opponent, creating a viewing experience that’s both fulfilling and unpredictable. What’s also fulfilling — and in the end heartwarming — are the lessons that the characters are presented with. In our current hustle culture, consumer-driven society, we, like Puss in Boots, are always looking for the next thing to keep us busy or the hottest new toy to get our hands on. As a result, we forget to stop and appreciate what we have and forget that life is more than those things. Perro is able to stop and smells the roses, something that Puss has never done before. He has taken life by the sword. It’s been a life full of adventure and admiration, sure, but a life that’s been lonely, too. Love and friendship turn out to be the biggest discovery on this quest for Puss’s wishing star. But it’s not just a film about love and friendship, though, it’s about how it’s okay to be afraid. It’s a foreign emotion to Puss, but he learns how to face it, no matter the result. And what’s life without a bit of risk, anyway?",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2022"," Burned through a bunch more FYC screeners this week with still more to go. My GWNYFCA picks are in with the complete list of nominations being announced later today (12/23). And since my OFCS ballot isn’t due until 1/15, next week will consist of catching all the GWNYFCA nominees I haven’t yet seen to try and make my final vote as close to 100% as possible (although I might have to try and sneak out to AVATAR in theaters in order to do so depending on how the ballot shakes out). I’ll hopefully fit in a few Christmas films too since it’s the season for Muppets and Michael Caine. But for those uninterested in yuletide favorites, it’s also the season for awards contenders finally being made available to the masses thanks to Santa’s annual gift of a staggered Wednesday/Friday release schedule. I’m a big fan of Joanna Hogg’s films, so I was really looking forward to THE ETERNAL DAUGHTER both because of its connections to her previous two films (THE SOUVENIR and THE SOUVENIR: PART II) by way of its characters and its foray into the supernatural (of sorts). She’s created a haunted house thriller wherein the ghosts arrive within the baggage of the visitors rather than the old mansion-turned-hotel itself. Julie Hart’s (Tilda Swinton) mother Rosalind (also Swinton) used to stay there often as a child when it was owned by her aunt, so the former thinks it a nice birthday destination for the latter to let those joyous days flood back. With them, however, are also bad days. This place held both the playful fun of adolescent adventures and the horrors of trauma. Julie didn’t plan on that darkness. She only wanted to give her mother a glimpse into happier times and perhaps use the stories sparked by the memory in a new film she’s writing (Hogg simultaneously delivering its creation and result in a meta play on time). Finding that despair leaves a mark by ensuring Julie retain her own anguish of discovering those truths and the images of what Rosalind looked like when relating them. It casts a pallor on the entire proceedings wherein Julie cannot sleep or work. The wind, fog, and sounds of “ghosts” keep her trapped in a loop of her own making. The film looks great and Swinton is great as the doting daughter and increasingly troubled mother whose spiraling demeanor brings with it a reveal that’s less surprising than it is welcome (Hogg casts one actor in two parts to render her compositions as the solution to a technical problem while also solving a narrative one). Does its discovery warrant ninety-plus minutes of what often feel like repetitive motions confirming what we already know? I sadly lean towards “No.” That’s not to say the messaging and metaphor don’t resonate, though. I simply posit that they still would if pared down to a thirty-minute short since I couldn’t stop checking my watch. As one son tragically dies in the water every superstitious fisherman on this remote Irish island refuses to learn to swim, another returns. Brian (Paul Mescal) has been gone for years, telling everyone he’d moved to Australia despite never sending an address. It’s thus a dream come true for his mother Aileen (Emily Watson). Children who leave rarely come back and those who stay often find themselves drowning like Brian’s old friend Mark or languishing in what becomes a prison of the soul. So, she lets him pick up where he left off working her father-in-law’s oyster farm now that he’s unable and her husband, Declan Conlon’s Con, couldn’t maintain it alone. It’s not what Brian ever wanted, but Aileen’s never been happier. That high doesn’t last long, however. This perfect façade Aileen hopes might come to fruition starts stalling when father and son argue about the latter risking his life by working the farm at high tide and threatens to deteriorate once and for all when she’s called to the police station to answer a question: Was Brian with her the night of an attack? We know what she does, namely that she left him at the bar with his old high school flame Sarah (Aisling Franciosi). And considering the events that transpire the next morning, Aileen has to know something isn’t quite right. But can she throw this dream away so soon? Her instinct is to lie. To protect her perfect son at the cost of everything. GOD’S CREATURES is co-directed by Saela Davis and Anna Rose Holmer (writer and director of THE FITS, respectively) with a similar sense of tension. Written by Shane Crowley (from a story by Fodhla Cronin O’Reilly and himself), the plot unfolds with a quiet yet hopeful intensity as we meet the players in this close-knit community that’s as quick to mourn a loss as throw the living under the bus to maintain the status quo. We can feel a reckoning approaching once the honeymoon of this prodigal son’s return starts wearing off, but we also want to believe Aileen’s image of her son is pure. By defending him without even talking to Sarah, however, she can’t help but let reality finally come into focus. It’s a fantastic piece of storytelling with an authentic air of emotion that never feels unearned or embellished. This is a “boy’s club” world wherein abuse has always been ignored or accepted due to generations of embedded misogyny. And while it’s one thing to look the other way or let it happen to you, conscious complicity in someone else’s abuse is different. What does this choice do to how Aileen looks at her son? At herself? To lie is to let the entire town turn Sarah into a pariah. And for what? More toxic male rage to come? More silence for women like her own daughter Erin (Toni O’Rourke) to endure their pain alone? The film’s second half (the lie occurs exactly at the midpoint) is tightly wound to ensure we cannot look away no matter how certain we are something even worse is on the horizon. Watson and Franciosi are amazing, their early friendship contrasted by their wordless glaring as though embroiled in a game of chicken that always finds the former’s Aileen turning in shame first. But what I loved the most is how the filmmakers never pretend this culture isn’t an intrinsic feature of the landscape—that the way forward won’t also be driven by dark secrets. It’s a somber, heart-crushing affair where dreams must forever remain unfulfilled fantasy. Tobias Lindholm’s THE GOOD NURSE is a pretty solid true life drama that I believe works as well as it does because he and screenwriter Krysty Wilson-Cairns didn’t try and turn Charles Graeber’s non-fiction novel into a thriller. We know Charlie Cullen (Eddie Redmayne) is killing these people. That’s not up for debate. And humanizing him through his genuine friendship with Amy Loughren (Jessica Chastain) doesn’t negate that fact. I’d argue he becomes scarier as a result because it proves he is good at his job. He has the capacity to save lives. You could almost read his story in a way that makes him a warped activist trying to expose the hospital system’s penchant for caring more about their financial liability than human lives. Maybe that’s why he’s never admitted “why.” That aspect is admittedly the most interesting. All the stuff between Charlie and Amy is familiar territory as far as “he was such a nice guy” hindsight is concerned. Where the filmmakers really hit their stride is the investigation headed by Noah Emmerich and Nnamdi Asomugha’s detectives and how their every move is obstructed by the hospital’s risk manager played by Kim Dickens. She’s impeding their progress because she needs time to get Charlie off her payroll before they can charge him with a crime. Talk about evil. And you can’t even put all the blame squarely upon her shoulders since she represents the ninth hospital to do so. Redmayne is great in the role (the only reason I watched was because he keeps being mentioned as a potential Oscar nominee). Until a few instances later on when things begin to finally unravel for him, he’s a walking exemplar of empathy—so much so that we never fear for Amy or her daughters’ well-being, even when Lindholm tries to pretend we should. As such, I’d argue that it’s Chastain who leaves an even bigger mark. Between her heart disease, the pressures of being a single mother, her job responsibilities, and navigating the realization that her best friend is a murderer, her character is put through the ringer and more. She’s the “good nurse,” after all. The only one who finally did something. Every time Chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes) claps his hands to mark a new course, the entire dining room jumps in fright. And that’s before they discover they should be afraid. Because this exorbitantly-priced, exclusive seat at Hawthorne comes with a twist … but I’ll leave that to director Mark Mylod and screenwriters Seth Reiss and Will Tracy since the reveal proves an unforgettable moment of confusion insofar as believing whether what we’ve seen is real or part of the show. We want to assume the latter due to the theatricality and surreal absurdity of it all. Yet the longer we stay with these characters (guests and chefs alike), the more we understand that intent is everything. THE MENU delivers a brilliant tonal mix of suspense thrills and humor considering how meticulously matter-of-fact the inevitable horrors and woefully up-their-own-asses the clientele prove. Between the table of “bros” (Arturo Castro, Rob Yang, and Mark St. Cyr), the washed up actor (John Leguizamo) name-dropping the chef as a personal friend, the elitist critic (Janet McTeer) and her editor (Paul Adelstein), and the aging couple (Reed Birney and Judith Light) treating this apparently magical (and bank-busting) event like just another Tuesday, there’s plenty of fodder for kitchen vs. customer antics. Restaurant host Elsa (Hong Chau) is only happy to comply. But there’s also the pathologically oblivious Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and his date Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy). He’s practically orgasmic the minute they land on the private island knowing his palette will shortly be tasting the world’s greatest food. She couldn’t care less because she was a last-minute addition—one that has thrown Slowik and his staff for a loop. The reason is crucial to the insanity to come and her background methodically constructed to allow the expository themes of service industry rage to grab a foothold for their explanation rather than merely screaming it into a void populated by those immune to its point. Is the whole a bit too perfect in its plotting as a result? Perhaps. That precision is actually one of the best parts of the first hour considering how much comedy is born from it. Fiennes, Chau, and the restaurant staff are impeccable in their deadpan deliveries to offset the mounting frustration and shock their actions provoke from the “eaters.” This juxtaposition is so good that the whole suffers a bit when the truth of what’s happening and Margot’s presence are finally reconciled. The third act proves somewhat rushed and messy, the joke finding its limits with apparently nowhere to go. Thankfully, however, Mylod and company do stick the landing, pivoting back to cold, calculating finality with just a hint of earned (albeit conveniently) compassion. Brett Morgen’s MOONAGE DAYDREAM is by all accounts a sensory experience rather than your usual idea of a documentary—rock, biographical, or otherwise. Sanctioned by the late David Bowie’s estate, Morgen comes in and hyper-kinetically edits together a two-plus hour epic of archival footage and interviews to juxtapose our assumptions with his public image and artistic prowess via an overarching representation of the icon’s “essence.” It’s not going to be for everyone due to its nonlinear linearity, expressionistic aesthetic, and over-long runtime, but even its detractors must admit the audacity of the enterprise is worth a look. I enjoyed it. I didn’t love it. Would that opinion have changed had I seen it during its IMAX run? Maybe. It’s definitely built for a large screen and deafening surround-sound, so those attributes are perhaps a requisite for the so-called “transcendence” that many are quick to describe. That’s not to say it isn’t effective on a 50-inch television with a soundbar too. As a fan of the artist and the music, it was a treat to see and hear what Morgen did in the edit bay (although the repetitive footage was a distraction) to breathe new life into the artifacts. Would I prefer a more straightforward biography? Yes. These things can often trend towards the realization that we let celebrities/artists talk too much rather than simply letting the work speak for itself. Because rather than clamor to watch this specific interpretation again (in many ways it says more about Morgen’s relationship with an enigma than Bowie himself), my first thought upon its completion was to fire up a couple albums and YouTube a few music videos—those that were included and, especially, those that weren’t. What if, before intentionally earning a court martial at West Point, Edgar Allan Poe helped solve a murder that ultimately drew thematic parallels to his later work with the assistance of prophetic poems told to him in dream by his dead mother? Well, Louis Bayard sought to answer that question with his novel THE PALE BLUE EYE, presently adapted by writer/director Scott Cooper for the big screen. Poe (Harry Melling) is but a cadet who fancies himself a poet—a bystander with an aptitude for problem solving that intrigues lead character Augustus Landor (Christian Bale) enough to hire him on the sly as his “man inside.” The victim: an apparent suicide whose body was later relieved of its heart post-mortem. With a sprawling cast that relegates Robert Duvall and Charlotte Gainsbourg to only a couple scenes each so as not to bog down the proceedings, Cooper drops us into the Hudson Valley’s isolated militarized zone with everyone on-edge about rumors of Satanic rituals. Landor is hired by the school itself to try and keep matters in-house, his reputation as an investigator of renown enough to gloss over his recent bout of alcoholism as a result of the death and disappearance of his wife and daughter respectively. He and Poe strike up a infectious rapport as they try to uncover a mystery that gets more complicated by the day … and rising body count. Marked by a finely-tuned narrative progression that dabbles in the occult to keep the players and us on our toes, there’s really nobody on-screen who doesn’t set off our radars at least once. The Captain (Simon McBurney) who’s always watching with a skeptical eye from the fringes. The school doctor (Toby Jones) who’s either careless or conniving as far as his current coroner work. His eccentric wife (Gillian Anderson), their ill daughter (Lucy Boynton), and brashly confident son (Harry Lawtey). The latter’s peer group of other cadets speaking in riddles and inside jokes (Fred Hechinger and Joey Brooks). Heck, even Poe himself (Melling is very good) once lies are revealed. Landor must absorb it all. The film starts down a suspense thriller road before settling into what becomes a rather straightforward murder mystery, complete with long-winded recaps and brainstorming sessions between Landor and Poe that ultimately lead towards a grand Poirot-esque unraveling of hidden truths. Cooper keeps a tight ship with some well-placed imagery of what haunts Landor (Bale is also great), setting the mood and also the stage for what’s to come. It gets much darker than I anticipated and excels at maintaining an air of sophisticated drama while also delving into some horror corners. And despite the denouement not proving too difficult to guess, it never feels forced. A solid piece all-around. Eleven years is a long time to wait for a sequel, but here we are getting PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH anyway. I guess you can justify it when you’re talking about a spin-off to what was Dreamworks’ flagship animated franchise—especially with a planned reboot of SHREK also on the docket. You cap your quadrilogy with PUSS IN BOOTS in 2011, bide time to ride the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON wave, and then dip your toes back into the fairy tale universe housing Far Far Away with a standalone lark first. Give us another adventure with swashbuckling hero Puss in Boots (Antonio’s Banderas) to set the table. You could say all those years passed for the characters too considering screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow position mortality as the central theme of our return. Puss is back at his usual antics dripping in ego and invincibility when he suddenly wakes upon a doctor’s table to learn he’s just lost his eighth life. That means he only has one left—a fact he initially brushes off with a shrug before coming face-to-face with The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). Is the latter’s bounty hunter truly skilled enough to take Puss down and finally pierce his skin with a blade? Or has all this talk of dying shaken Puss into losing his edge? Either way, retirement seems his sole alternative to oblivion. Rather than end the story in anonymity, however, CROODS: A NEW AGE director Joel Crawford and company introduce the myth of “the last wish.” With Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Bear Crime Family (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) all on its trail, it’s only fitting that Puss would join one last thrill ride in the hopes of wishing his lives back. And while they all crave something they think they need but might already have (save Jack as he’s literally just a self-aware soulless ghoul), along comes little Perrito (Harvey Guillén) wanting for nothing but friendship like all the best dogs do. It’s a kitchen sink-type, chaotic race through the magical dark forest with life lessons, flashbacks, and the irreverent humor we’ve come to love from this franchise. I could do without the anime-style, herky-jerky fight aesthetic shifting from 3D to a faux-2D perspective, but otherwise enjoyed the animation upgrade. The bear family is auditioning to be Guy Ritchie’s latest band of hapless wannabe thieves, Mulaney is having way too much fun as a psychopathic nursery rhyme (opposite his Jiminy Cricket facsimile “conscience” voiced by a Jimmy Stewart-channeling Kevin McCann), the Wolf lends a legitimate sense of urgency with a dark foreboding and Omar Little whistle, and Puss, Kitty, and Perrito teach us that a life of love beats legend any day. While the calls for RRR (RISE ROAR REVOLT) to get an Oscar nomination as Best Picture (since India chose LAST FILM SHOW for International Film consideration instead, ultimately making the shortlist) are akin to the people who wanted SPIDER-MAN: FAR FROM HOME to get one last year—namely that the shiny new toy you just saw being fun and exciting doesn’t mean it’s a masterpiece—I can’t say S.S. Rajamouli’s epic isn’t still an absolute blast. With crazy choreographed fights, a ton of romance and humor, wall-to-wall computer effects (including wild animals that probably didn’t need a full disclaimer to tell us as much in case we were worried real tigers, etc. were used), and the most homo-erotic leading duo since POINT BREAK, what’s not to love about this historical-set fantasy? Hardly original in narrative with adversaries accidentally becoming best friends only to realize it too late and have to choose between “brother” and “mission,” it is wild in its orchestration with one climactic fight unfolding fully on piggyback. There’s some big brain insanity in that respect to offset the otherwise over-the-top theatricality of caricatured villains (Ray Stevenson and Alison Doody as the governor and his bloodthirsty wife leave little scenery left after chowing down every time the camera places them in frame) and swooning score. But that’s Tollywood for you. It’s all a heightened state of reality with musical montages, interludes (“Naatu Naatu” made the Oscar Song shortlist), and supernatural-esque sequences imbuing men with God-like powers. And why shouldn’t Bheem (N.T. Rama Rao Jr.) and Ram (Ram Charan Teja) become Gods? These are two men who would laugh in the face of danger if they weren’t so gosh darn serious every time danger rears its head (it’s often, very often). The former is his peaceful village’s champion, sent to Delhi to rescue a young girl the governor “bought” by any means necessary. The latter is an ambitious royal officer in the governor’s army looking for a promotion by single-handedly jumping into a violent gang of Indian civilians to arrest someone who dared to throw a rock, earning a couple concussions for his trouble. They were rendered as Gods well before the plot (and music lyrics) caught up. Gods, patriots, lovers, and friends-to-the-end. Who better to start an explosive revolution? Why doesn’t Rama (Kayije Kagame) want her family to know she’s pregnant? That’s the central question I took from an extended prologue of sorts wherein she and her white husband Adrien (Thomas de Pourquery) visit her Senegalese mother and sisters for a meal before leaving Paris on a work trip. Everyone exchanges their usual pleasantries, asking what they’ve been up to, etc. Adrien is careful with his language when explaining that they won’t be vacationing this year because of a “major project” to complete at the house. He looks at Rama to deliver the news and she avoids the subject, dismissing the implication completely. Why? Alice Diop and her co-writers (Amrita David and Marie N’Diaye) set the stage for SAINT OMER to deliver a simple answer: that Rama is nervously unsure of what’s to come. From an opening dream calling out for her own mother to the obvious strain in their present-day relationship, we can assume she fears becoming that which she now resents. And it’s not without reason once memories of conflict and emotional repression rear their head. How much of who her mother is will rub off once she’s a mother herself? Is giving birth a mistake? Will attending the trial of a young woman accused of infanticide help her to see that things could be worse? Or will doing so prove they already are? The juxtaposition is ultimately a heartbreaking one since the reality of Laurence Coly’s (Guslagie Malanda) case proves much more complex than the news reports her very conservative and white community of Saint-Omer depict. They paint her as a murderer. A monster. And she doesn’t necessarily disagree since she admits to the crime. But not to the guilt. Her defense is sorcery—that her aunts cursed her. Her attorney’s defense is insanity. The truth lies somewhere in-between once details reveal that Laurence’s circumstances are so heavily steeped in cultural bias and racist imperatives. People ask how this “intelligent” and “eloquent” Black woman could do such a thing? But how do either of those attributes matter? Laurence’s parents put undue pressure upon her to be unimpeachable in white society. She moved to France to get away from that unspoken oppression only to find herself in Saint-Omer with an older white boyfriend (Xavier Maly’s Luc Dumontet) and an increasingly hostile air of “otherness” that led to an unhealthy seclusion. Her entire life was thus dictated by this idea of manufactured perception—to be that which others demanded rather than finding that which she embraced. Rama sees her own insecurities projected throughout the courtroom. The preconceptions. The assumptions. The casual disregard for the fifteen-month-old victim in lieu of deciding which adult was more at fault for her death. Reading that much of the on-screen scenario was born from lived experience (Diop, like Rama, sat in on a real infanticide trial herself) makes sense considering how meticulously rendered and performed the courtroom scenes are. But also because of the emotions Diop imbues via her actors’ performances and her decision to splice in Rama’s silent memories of a tired mother struggling to survive under the weight of unjust expectation. The comparison allows for a refocused understanding of who this woman was. Because while motherhood is inherently scary and the past, present, and future of one’s own DNA and environment exacerbate that terror, knowing this truth can also be a blessing. No matter how alone you may feel, you never truly are. I think it’s official: Ruben Östlund films just aren’t for me. While I enjoyed FORCE MAJEURE a lot (yet still not as much as it seemed everyone else around me did), THE SQUARE was simply too scattershot and on-the-nose to really enjoy it as more than a lark. I feel the same about TRIANGLE OF SADNESS, probably because it’s pretty much the same film—skewering the fashion world and capitalism instead of the art world. Both have memorable dinner scenes. Both possess a game cast with some genuinely hilarious moments. And both are way too long. Östlund has some great ideas, but it almost seems his goal is to intentionally push the joke beyond its limits of insufferability. I love the idea of satirizing the wealth gap by having outlandishly rich patrons on a yacht juxtaposed against the overworked and fearful help desperately seeking a big tip they probably won’t get (rich people are often rich because they are the most frugal people alive). I’m not sure Östlund actually brings anything new to the table on the topic, though. He pokes fun at those who earn their wealth with filth (Zlatko Buric’s “shit salesman” is an unhinged riot), weapons, and influence (the late Charlbi Dean’s Yaya and Harris Dickinson as her boyfriend Carl are the straight men and thus de facto leads), but only for gags. Even Woody Harrelson’s comedic timing can’t save an underwritten role that’s only here as a socialist American foil to Buric’s capitalist Russian. And the help rarely get more than directions to look awkwardly uncomfortable. Act One intrigues because of its intimate scale and conversations about gender roles where it pertains to money (it’s just Dean and Dickinson arguing about financial intent when it comes to dating). Act Two widens the scope by putting them on a cruise well out of their price range (Yaya got tickets in exchange for some Instagram posts), but it quickly pushes them to the background to let the caricatures around them act like fools. Act Three flirts with true commentary by leaving a handful of passengers shipwrecked on an island with the yacht’s “toilet manager” (a wonderful Dolly De Leon) flipping the table to become their leader as the only person who can survive with her own two hands, but it never takes the next step. Östlund is an expert at writing gags, but I just can’t buy that they add up to anything like so many others apparently can. Watching Darren Aronofsky’s cinematic adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter’s play THE WHALE doesn’t make me wonder how it works on-stage as much as how it might work under the guidance of a more sympathetic director. That’s not to say Aronofsky is unsympathetic. I think he and Brendan Fraser bring the character of Charlie to life in a way that objectively humanizes him and allows his pain—created from an unyielding anguish and depression—to be understood. Unfortunately, however, you cannot deny that Aronofsky doesn’t also lean into the external, horror-infused perspective that people like Charlie are often dismissed as grotesque, pitiable monsters. It’s therefore tough to reconcile our desire to empathize with the tempest of emotions surrounding him against an adaptation that seems hellbent on preventing us from doing so. It’s a slippery slope. You do need to depict people’s heinous persecution of him since it’s a part of his story. A lot of what Charlie has become stems from the stigma that society places upon obesity (and homosexuality). The trick is thus not using that depiction in a way that, intentionally or not, normalizes that reaction. We spend almost ninety minutes with Charlie as he bares his soul while the facts surrounding his struggles (fatherhood, sexuality, religion, mental illness, etc.) are revealed. Why, after all that, do you then create a scene wherein he’s “caught” in public in such a way that the person who sees him runs away? What does that add? It’s one thing if the film was about said reaction en route to judging society’s shortcomings. But it’s not. It doesn’t. So, choosing to portray it anyway feeds into calls of exploitation. You don’t need that shame to then catalyze Charlie’s subsequent decision to voluntarily be seen. Thinking you do is lazy. What a shame too considering the performances Aronofsky receives from Fraser (the fat suit, while problematic, was always going to prove necessary for financing since this film doesn’t get made with an unknown entity who’s naturally that size) and Hong Chau as his friend/nurse Liz. They imbue a bottomless wealth of compassion and history to these characters—so much so that the love they share easily outweighs the cruelty of others sneaking in. Their tenderness provides the leeway to let Sadie Sink’s Ellie (Charlie’s estranged daughter) be so vicious. She has every reason to be that way after all. His obesity is merely an easy target with which to package her justified rage. It does beg us to ask the million dollar question, though: Why make Charlie obese at all? Because being able to narratively use it as a means of manifesting his self-loathing and guilt isn’t good enough. That renders it a stunt and ultimately feeds into the stigma rather than combat it. You can argue that it’s just one example of many instances of psychological trauma on-screen, but it’s the only one that takes physical shape. Ellie’s issues don’t utilize a fat suit. Thomas’ (Ty Simpkins) don’t either. At a certain point, Charlie’s disability stops being a character trait to become the entire character. And yet the film continually refuses to acknowledge it because it would rather just use it as a trigger for Charlie to want to get his affairs in order. That way Hunter can ratchet up the drama via more secrets couched in a not-so-deep commentary on Red State politics without ever confronting the sickness itself. Because without Fraser and Chau's performances, that's all this really is: a shallow plea for kindness in a world so cynical that people have grown less accepting than they already were in hopes that God gives them a reserved seat at the apocalypse. “And in that gaping silence was the real horror.” What a line. It’s spoken via narration towards the beginning of Sarah Polley’s adaptation of Miriam Toews’ novel WOMEN TALKING—words born from hindsight by one of the young girls residing in the strict Mennonite colony where it is set. She’s providing context for the meeting that’s being held in a hayloft between the women of three families attempting to decide the fate of all women in their community. The “silence” is their lack of language, education, and privilege to fight back. The “horror” is their subsequent inability to band together and stop the atrocities committed upon them by their men while also allowing themselves to become involuntarily complicit to that violence. It’s the product of a power void those same men created and continue to enforce to maintain their control. And the time has come to fill it with righteous fury. While the events on-screen are fictional (and described as such by a clarifying caption), don’t be fooled into believing its exercise isn’t based in truth. I’m certain there will be some viewers who discover that it takes place in 2010 and scoff, ignorant to the fact that Toews loosely based the scenario on real events that occurred in Bolivia circa 2011. There, like here, saw the rampant and unchecked domestic abuse and rape by men from the community against their wives, sisters, daughters, and neighbors with the assistance of animal tranquilizers. The women in the film were told they were hallucinating. Lying for attention. Victims of ghosts or demons. Only when one caught her attacker and forced him to name names were they finally arrested. So, the colony leaders did the only thing they could do: threaten the women to forgive their abusers or lose their place in Heaven. In another of many brilliant lines of dialogue, it’s explained that these women who cannot read or write quickly teach themselves how to vote. There are three choices to decide between while all the men are in town trying to bail out their brethren. Stay and forgive. Stay and fight. Or leave and never return. The narrative premise is that the democratic process ends in a three-way tie pitting three of the most well-respected families against each other to hold a debate. Frances McDormand’s domineering and scarred Janz won’t be swayed from forgiveness. Salome (Claire Foy), daughter of Agata (Judith Ivey), wants blood. Her sister Ona (Rooney Mara), impregnated by her rapist, sees leaving as the freedom to witness a world that’s been kept from them. Add Greta’s (Sheila McCarthy) desire to at least try finding consensus despite her daughter Mariche (Jessie Buckley) angrily interrupting and refuting the others’ points and the stage is set for a rousing dialogue that moves between indignation, introspection, pragmatism, unbridled emotion, and even a few well-placed hints of humor. We hear their respective cases, watch as they alter minds and change their own, and get transported back to their individual traumas with effectively rendered flashbacks that always prove contextually relevant to the current topic of conversation. Faith. Pacifism. Education. Love. Autonomy. It may just be eight women and their minutes-taker (Ben Whishaw’s recently returned August) arguing in one room for the duration, but it’s the most dynamic and tense film I’ve seen all year. Because you don’t know how things will shake out. The narration teases that some of these women leave, but says nothing about the nightmarish drama that could potentially occur beforehand—whether by the men’s early return or the women passionately defending their right to not back down. Foy is a force of nature. Buckley is heartbreaking in her nihilism. Ivey and McCarthy deliver steadying maternal hands of wisdom earned from decades of knowing what “forgiveness” has already wrought. And Whishaw, along with August Winter’s Melvin, devastates as a masculine counterpoint that strengthens the women’s resolve. We’re witnessing a reckoning—a rebellious cry to erase that silence once and for all with tears of sadness for what’s left behind and joy for what’s to come. And above all else: relief. Here’s a fun one from KUFFS wherein Tony Goldwyn says the f-word so many times that they have to bleep all but one to keep a PG-13 rating. A solid gag. (Substack apparently can’t handle an embedded gif, so you’ll have to click over for a smoother experience. Or see everything at cinematicfbombs.com.) “I have to give Chazelle credit because he goes for broke and shows little room for regret. Unfortunately, no matter how electric those first couple hours may prove, the third (yes, full third hour) can't help but drag.” - Full review at HHYS. “Wells leaves the details unspoken via a formally fluid, sensorial experience. All we really know for certain is that their love for each other was undeniable—Mescal (unforgettably vulnerable) and Corio's performances ensure it.” - Full review at HHYS. “The juxtaposition of what they're doing in such an antiquated setting is intriguing enough to keep our attention.

"Dec 23, 2022"," Luego de perder su octava y penúltima vida, el miedo se apodera del simpático Puss in Boots, personaje que conocimos por primera vez hace casi dos décadas en la popular secuela de Shrek. La muerte parecía un concepto muy lejano para el intrépido felino, quien ahora contempla cabizbajo su inevitable destino. Sin más remedio que aprovechar al máximo la última oportunidad que le resta, el legendario héroe decide retirarse por completo de su peligroso oficio, dejando atrás su característica capa y espada para mantener un perfil bajo. No obstante, la inesperada llegada de Goldilocks y su familia de osos a la casa de reposo donde éste habita lo llevará a emprender una nueva aventura: encontrar una estrella mágica que posee la facultad de conceder un solo deseo.  En compañía de Perro, un encantador sabueso que observa el mundo con gran positivismo, y la audaz Kitty Softpaws, quien fuera el amor de su vida, el peludo protagonista deberá armarse de valor para enfrentar al temible Jack Horner, un personaje salido de una rima infantil, y evitar que éste halle el camino hacia la estrella de los deseos. Un viaje lleno de grandes hazañas que le hará comprender el verdadero significado de la amistad y a valorar los pequeños detalles que llenan de felicidad el fugaz recorrido por este mágico universo.  Tras una década de ausencia, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (El Gato con Botas 2: El Último Deseo) nos re-introduce exitosamente a la tierra habitada por seres de cuentos de hadas con el peculiar humor de la saga de Shrek, sirviendo como preámbulo para un próximo episodio protagonizado por el ogro verde y su secuaz burro. Antonio Banderas y Salma Hayek retoman los roles que interpretaron en el 2011 y son acompañados en esta ocasión por Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Harvey Guillén, Wagner Moura y John Mulaney. Todos realizan un fantástico trabajo, pero es Guillén, conocido por la serie televisiva What We Do In The Shadows, quien se lleva la película como el hilarante y tierno Perro.  Como suele ser costumbre, la animación de DreamWorks Animation es de primer nivel. Desde la minuciosa labor para lograr que el pelaje del felino protagónico sea lo más realista posible, hasta las emocionantes secuencias de acción al mero estilo de Mad Max: Fury Road que sorprenden por su ingenio. Hablando de ello, la película está llena de chistes que deleitarán al público de todas las edades. Por ejemplo, el ajuste de Puss in Boots a su jubilación, o el intento de Perro por imitar la tierna mirada que popularizó el personaje principal. Asimismo, los breves cameos de personajes del universo de Shrek satisfarán a los fanáticos del reino de Far Far Away.  A pesar de que la cinta animada sigue una estructura narrativa convencional, el mayor acierto de Puss in Boots: The Last Wish radica en la fuerza de su mensaje. Uno que resulta ad hoc para la época decembrina de celebraciones familiares y de propósitos de año nuevo, al recordarnos que solamente tenemos una oportunidad para vivir plenamente y que debemos aprovechar al máximo cada momento que se nos regala junto a quienes nos quieren y aprecian. Una bonita reflexión para chicos y grandes que nos invita a examinar nuestras prioridades, recapacitar, e invertir el tiempo sabiamente en lo más valioso e importante. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (El Gato con Botas 2: El Último Deseo) estrena en cines a partir del 23 de diciembre del 2023.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2022"," Typically when it comes to films, and sequels especially, spending years in development hell can be a very bad sign. The difficulties in getting the product completed can reflect too many creative energies clashing or a lack of clear direction. It can lead to countless script revisions, studio interference, and perhaps worst of all: indifference from a public who no longer care about the property. But sometimes, a wait is very much worth it if the product is visually stunning, emotionally resonant, and entertaining as hell despite some minor weaknesses in the story. I’m talking of course about Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. Set after the events of the Shrek films, we open on Puss In Boots (Antonio Banderas) discovering that he’s down to the last of his nine lives. After a brief stint laying low at a cat shelter, he decides to seek out a legendary wishing star to get the rest of his lives back. But he’s not the only one seeking it. Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family also want the star, as does “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Then there’s the alpha wolf bounty hunter (Wagner Moura) tracking Puss to take him in dead or alive…preferably dead. Puss enlists the help of Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a wannabe therapy dog (Harvey Guillén) to get to the star before anyone else does and before the Wolf can take him out. As someone who doesn’t care much for the Shrek franchise as a whole, I found the original Puss In Boots to be a breath of fresh air. It was less concerned with fairy tale satire and far more focused on telling a fun story; in fact, the fairy tale elements were the least enjoyable parts of it. It was just a thrilling adventure with great animation, excellent voice acting, a tight and committed cast, and one of the best dance battles I’ve ever seen on film. The Spanish setting gave the film an infectious energy and distinct identity separate from the fantasy grab bag of the Shrek films.  But The Last Wish isn’t simply a recreation of what made the first film sing. This is an evolution in nearly all ways, from the visuals to the story to the voice acting. Nearly everything here is better the second time around, and even the flaws of the first film are less pronounced here.  The film’s animation is probably the most obvious change here. Inspired by the phenomenal animation of Into The Spider-Verse, the visuals in The Last Wish have a distinct style separate from what’s come before. Instead of aiming for more realistic textures and movement, the animation here is designed to more closely resemble a storybook. There’s a remarkable painterly vibe to the animation, giving it a look that’s both innovative and oddly, sweetly vintage. Some of the action scenes are also highlighted by a change in frame rate and speed, adding a kind of anime-style hyper-reality accent to set pieces that are already full of tight, precise choreography. That includes the adrenaline-fueled opening that has Puss going up against a tree giant and using a church bell as a weapon. The visuals have matured and grown, divorcing themselves from the shiny, sleek approach of the Shrek films. I really can’t stress how appealing and intriguing the animation here is. From the perspective of a lifelong animation fan, seeing a unique animated approach from a mainstream studio makes my heart leap just a little. It’s a level of care and commitment that shows through in the final product. The stunning visual palette is perfectly echoed by Heitor Pereia’s dynamic, multi-colored score that blends acoustic and electronic and is capable of both sun-soaked, kinetic action and graceful, elegiac emotion.  The vocal performances have also matured in more ways than one. It’s not just a matter of the returning cast having themselves aged. Whereas the original film took place before the events of Shrek 2, this is set at some point after the last Shrek film. Hearing a gruffer, deeper, and more wonderfully aged voice coming out of Puss is highly appropriate, and Antonio Banderas does not disappoint. Puss has become an iconic character almost entirely based on Banderas’ charming performance and clear love for the role. Compared to the previous Puss film, the character here is just as full of bravado and daring-do, but that’s underlined by a world-weariness and (as we find out) paralyzing fear of death that he’s only barely able to hide. It’s a multi-layered performance that’s beautiful to see and hear. Banderas isn’t alone, though. In general, the voice cast is entirely on their game and knocking it out of the dark forest. Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws is the definite yin to Puss’ yang, her energy just as anarchic but much more controlled and subtle than Puss’ exuberance. Hayek is a fantastic counterpoint to Banderas, and just like in the first film, the two play off of each other perfectly. They’re complimented even further by Harvey Guillén’s “Perrito”, who’s earnestness and innocence always comes off as endearing and not annoying. It’s almost impossible to dislike the character, even as his wide-eyed approach to the world gets under the fur of the more cynical and pragmatic Puss and Kitty. The antagonists here get just as much screen time as the good guys, and that’s for the most part a good thing. Florence Pugh’s Goldilocks is just a fun time, and her being at the head of a crime family of bears taps into a very specific form of logic. The family dynamic is balanced well, and Pugh is capably backed up by Olivia Coleman and Ray Winstone, who plays affable thuggery like a fine art. However, the most intriguing character by far is Wagner Moura’s Wolf. He has a legitimately terrifying design, with his glowing red eyes, intimidating build, and a super-sharp sickle in each hand. Moura’s performance is chilling and hypnotic in equal measures, and his mere presence gives the film a deliciously uncomfortable undercurrent of threatening, inescapable darkness. That might seem like an odd quality to compliment in an animated film, but it makes perfect sense here. This is a story about facing your own limitations, and in the case of Puss, your own mortality. It’s an very adult existential crisis, but it’s handled with care and attention. For the first time in a long time, Puss has come face to face with his own fears, no longer able to hide them with his heroic persona. This is sometimes literal; whenever the Wolf draws near, every hair on Puss’ body stands on end. Seeing Puss in such a vulnerable way gives him new dimensions and depth, making his adventures more than just a fun time.  A strong theme in the story here is appreciation for what we have instead of focusing on what we lack or (more importantly) what we think we need to be happy and how we discover the truth between the two. The topic itself might not be terribly original, but the execution of it is handled well. When the characters reach the pocket dimension where the wishing star is kept, they discover that the land itself shifts based on who’s holding the treasure map and what obstacles they need to face to realize their inner truth and confront their own self-doubt. The film mines some deep psychological depths but packages them in a very digestible, colorful way.  Not every part of the story works as well as it should, however. Despite John Mulaney’s solid performance, Big Jack Horner is a poorly-sketched and fleshed-out character with the most basic motivations and backstory of the cast. He wants the star just so he can have all the magic power in the world, and that’s it. He’s your average sociopath bully, but armed with a bag of holding full of pilfered fairy tale artifacts and magical creatures (he uses a phoenix as a flamethrower at one point). There’s a reason he’s the least highlighted character in the trailers, and especially compared a genuinely compelling villain like the Wolf, he comes off as almost completely unnecessary. The threat he poses comes off as too basic compared to the Wolf and especially to Puss’ own inner demons. Jack’s continued presence in the film gives it a feeling of it being slightly overstuffed and the inescapable feeling that time spent with Jack could be spent better by focusing on literally any other character. Regardless of Jack horning in on the plot, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a refreshingly and surprisingly complex film disguised as a lighthearted animated adventure. And that’s a very good thing. While still thriving on the swashbuckling vibe of Puss’ previous exploits, this film frames them in the context of maturity and the holistic nature of our life’s path. This isn’t just a fun, exciting quest; this is a fun, exciting quest with a highly relatable, highly emotional candy center. Who knew that a sequel to a Shrek spin-off would be so damn satisfying on so many levels? “I know who you are. I can see you. You’re swearing now that someday you’ll destroy me. Remember…far better women than you have sworn to do the same. Go look for them now.”",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2022"," “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is the sequel we didn’t know we needed. With a fairy tale-inspired animation style that differs from the more realistic look of the previous “Shrek” films, this second theatrical outing for the title feline distinguishes itself from other franchise offerings. When Puss (Antonio Banderas) vanquishes a giant monster threatening a village, a large bell crashes violently down on top of the swashbuckling hero. The shocking death is met with some joking when the famous cat breathes again, looking no worse for wear. But this death, his eighth in his lifetime, is cause for alarm. Puss in Boots is on his last life. After a visit from a frightening bounty hunter named the Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss realizes one more death might really be the end of the line. And Wolf is more than capable and plenty happy to usher Puss into the nether world. Determined to stay alive, the eternally self-absorbed Puss hangs up his hat and cape, burying them in the yard of Mama Luna (“Only Murders in the Building” star Da’Vine Joy Randolph), with whom he seeks refuge in his retirement. But an existence as a house cat proves to be a daunting undertaking. As the weeks pass, Puss grows a beard and gains a companion, a dog (Harvey Gullién from the series “What We Do in the Shadows”) masquerading as a cat. But when retirement is interrupted by a call from Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three protective bears, Puss begins to rethink his choice to leave the adventurer game behind. He surreptitiously learns from Goldi that there is a wishing star out there that might restore his lost eight lives. Puss and his little dog then set out on a journey to find the magical treasure. “The Last Wish” is excellent family entertainment. Banderas is in fine form delivering his character’s lines with droll confidence. Just the way he refers to himself, “Puss in Boots,” gets a recurring giggle. It rolls off the tongue infectiously, making it an instant earworm. And the story is populated with many colorful fairy tale-inspired faces that subvert their classic origins. For example, “Little” Jack Horner becomes “Big” Jack Horner, voiced with an acerbic wit by comedian John Mulaney. He’s armed to the teeth with magical weapons retrieved at will from a bottomless nanny bag. And, naturally, his relentless henchman makes up the “Baker’s Dozen.” But embedded with all the zany comedy bits is some effective pathos. Puss rekindles a romance with Kitty Softpaws (the voice of Salma Hayek, of course), and his faithful dog becomes his comfort animal as Puss copes with the anxiety associated with only having a single life left. However, Florence Pugh’s Goldilocks might warm your heart. Since three rough-and-tumble bears raised Goldi, she’s lost something of her delicate human identity. And while the bears have done the best they can to accommodate the young woman, she longs to harness the power of the wishing star to return to her own kind. Goldi’s relationship with her bear family is quite endearing. Olivia Colman and Ray Winstone are excellent choices for Mama and Papa Bear, which only adds to the depth of the bond. Even though Goldi and the three bears are initially revealed as thieving villains, it’s hard not to root for them. And when the film concludes, I suspect we’ve not seen the end of this foursome in any future installments. “The Last Wish” borrows the animation style we saw earlier this year in “The Bad Guys,” which might remind viewers of the look of the Oscar-winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” The images are very fluid and pleasing to watch and don’t have the strange, uncanny qualities that marked the earlier “Shrek” films.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2022"," Twelve years after the “Shrek” spinoff “Puss in Boots,” the sassy Spanish feline voiced by Antonio Banderas has returned for another fairy tale-busting adventure, directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado and written by Paul Fischer (with a story by Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler). Crawford, Mercado, and Fischer all worked on the DreamWorks Animation favorites “Trolls” and “Croods: A New Age,” and the trio bring a similar “chaotic good” energy to “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which remixes a new set of familiar nursery rhymes and beloved children’s fables to entertaining ends. Our titular tabby is living a swashbuckler’s life, swilling leche, singing songs, saving towns, raking in the adoration and accolades, when he dies his eighth death, landing him in his ninth, and final, life. Spooked by a visit from the grim-reaping Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), Puss decides to hang up his hat and boots and head for retirement in the home of a crazy cat lady, Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). The Times is committed to reviewing theatrical film releases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because moviegoing carries risks during this time, we remind readers to follow health and safety guidelines as outlined by the CDC and local health officials. But he can’t escape adventure, and soon Puss is caught up in the quest for a magical wish, which is in the possession of a greedy, pie-producing hoarder of enchanted trinkets, Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Remember him, with the Christmas pie and the plum on his thumb? Jack, now quite big, also is pursued by Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her Cockney crime syndicate family of bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, Samson Kayo), who want the wish to make things “just right,” of course. With his former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and new pup friend Perro (Harvey Guillén) joining in on the race to grab the wish, Puss learns how to cherish his one precious life by making a new friend, or burying the hatchet with Kitty. This is all explicated with fast, funny dialogue and therapy-style lessons delivered by an actual therapy dog. Blissed-out chihuahua Perro is more than happy to stop and smell the roses, and as it turns out, that’s a good way to make it through this maze called life. The irreverent twist on familiar characters makes “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” entertaining (the fact that it doesn’t overstay its welcome at a brisk 1 hour, 40 minutes helps too). What makes it great is the experimental and creative building of this world. The animation is dizzyingly fast and crisp, but it’s the production design by Nate Wragg and art direction by Joseph Feinsilver that sets this film apart. The backgrounds upon which Puss and pals traipse reference Candyland and Francisco Goya, with a rough-hewn painterly quality  that evokes a warm, appealing texture, as if you can see brushstrokes. Other settings are Technicolor hallucinatory fantasy-scapes, while the Big Bad Wolf’s angular lines and grayscale palette set off his gleaming red eyes and call to mind the aesthetic of a noir graphic novel. Banderas’ purring Puss has long been a favorite “Shrek” character, and he has great chemistry with Hayek’s Kitty, but the rest of the cast brings charismatic vocal performances as well, including Pugh, with her distinctive low tone, and Moura (known for his role on “Narcos”), who makes his Wolf singularly scary. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is one gorgeous and dynamic fractured fairy tale.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2022"," PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. With the voices of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, John Mulaney, Wagner Moura. Written by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow. Directed by Joel Crawford, Januel Mercado. Rated PG for action/violence, rude humor/language, and some scary moments. 100 min. In theaters. Daniel M. Kimmel is a veteran movie critic and author of a host of film-related books. His most recent novel is Banned in Boston. He is the 2018 recipient of the Skylark Award given by the New England Science Fiction Association. He lives in Somerville, Massachusetts. No, it’s not a terrible review. It’s a review you disagreed with.  I found the animation and storytelling creepy, inept, and offputting.  You didn’t.  You’re entitled to your opinion, as I am entitled to mine.  Learn that people can have different opinions than yours.  That’s what makes them opinions. Completely disagree with this review. The animation was striking (inspiration from the amazing Into The Spiderverse methinks) the action scenes often breathtaking. The voice acting top drawer. The story full of heart. The MAIN bad guy terrifying and created genuine jeopardy.  Maybe it sags a little in the middle but man I really wish all animation had this ambition. I’m 47 years old. My 7 and 8 year olds both thought it was a 10/10 also. Loved it. It’s not Family Feud, and your job isn’t to guess what the survey says. Your job is, indeed, simply to say whatever crosses your mind. But a critic’s value relates to how in-tune they are with reality and with the public’s general taste. An opinion so out of touch is frankly worthless. It does not help prospective viewers in making a decision, it does not provide a reliable feedback for the creators, and it does not reflect the world’s views. So I would ask, what IS your job really? What kind of value do you provide, if you can’t even recognize a good movie when you watch it? And I’m not just saying that, it’s statistically objective. It’s hardly objective. My job is not to validate the box office.  Audiences bought tickets for the “Transformers” movies.  That doesn’t require me to “reflect the world’s views” or “the public’s general taste.” My advice has always been to find a critic you’re on the same wavelength with and listen to him or her, not to insist that a critic must reflect back YOUR views. Your review is weak, I normally try to understand others perspective. But you give so little definition to your opinions. I just can’t agree with this review, please 🙏 give me an better understanding why you would give this movie such a low score. It feels like you didn’t watch the film, or squinted through you fingers whilst watching it. The animation was top tier as cartoons and anime go, the storytelling was on point teaching others about their own mortality for Puss, what a real family is like with goldilocks, how to trust with Kitty and that some people really are just scum inside with Jack Horner. It feels like you don’t understand that people can have different opinions and both are valid. I’ve never told someone they were wrong if they saw a movie and had a different take than me. Critics are not here to validate your opinions. Just watched it and I completely agree with your review, albeit we appear to be in the minority. It’s a mess of a film, forever trying to move forward the action through surreal twists. This somehow worked for me in The Croods: A New Age but not here. It was just flat, the dog was annoying, the bears even more do.  Redeeming it somewhat are a few genuinely good jokes and a few decent meaningful interactions between Puss and Kitty, and Goldilocks and the bears, before we lurch off again into a “look at this, isn’t it zany?!” acid trip. Thanks. There are several Oscar nominations I don’t get including several for the horrible “Triangle of Sadness.” It’s okay to be in the minority on a film.  It’s the rare film that scores either 100% or 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. What people need to understand is these are opinions and they’re not wrong simply because mine is different from yours. Absolutely. I’m in the minority on several other films cough cough Batman Begins cough cough. Still, I was surprised by the volume of positives for this dog’s breakfast of a film on Rotten Tomatoes. Hence spotting yours! While I do love this movie, I understand that we aren’t a collective hivemind that all have to think the same way about it. With that being said, do you have any thoughts on how they could have improved the movie in your eyes? Also, your comment about the movie’s animation being grotesque has made me curious. What style of animation would you say that you prefer? Artistically, this is gorgeous. The story is simple, but has a great flow to it. The characters are fun to watch, their growth explored. The score hits familiar bests and could be better at some points, but nothing is boring.  The animation is groundbreaking, grotesque *characters* nonwithstanding. Grotesque is welcome and appreciated, befitting the role. Scar was a grouesque lion. He was perfect. Exaggerated proportions are key ingredient to characters in most animated movies.  Sure, I bet there were people who did not love The Lion King. Who did not appreciate The Secret of Nimh. Who hated Felidae. Who were appalled by every classic in existence. And that’s fine. But when they tell others of these experiences for a living, they should try to explain better how their opinions were formed. And hopefully go deeper than saying X was “bad”.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2022"," Not sure what to see on Boxing Day? Our critics rate the new releases, including (from left) I Wanna Dance with Somebody, The Banshees of Inisherin, Matilda, Triangle of Sadness and the new Puss in Boots. There’s no bigger date on the Australian movie calendar than Boxing Day and, as always, there’s a rash of new releases on December 26 promising something for everyone. Well, for almost everyone: with every other distributor seemingly running scared in the face of Disney’s Avatar: The Way of Water, there’s a surprising lack of blockbuster action this year. The end of the year is typically when the big Hollywood studios release what they hope will be their awards contenders. So it is that The Banshees of Inisherin, Triangle of Sadness (which won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival in May) and The Lost King make their bows, with another big contender – Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans – to follow on January 5. But if this is a great time of year for lovers of serious cinema, it’s also a treat for families, with an animated Puss in Boots adventure, the live-action/animated hybrid musical Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile and Netflix’s film of Matilda the Musical all arriving. And for fans of music divas, there’s a must-see biopic of Whitney Houston. There’ll be plenty more over summer, too, and our team of film writers and critics will be covering all the big new releases, so stay tuned. But for now, here’s our guide to the Boxing Day movies. Enjoy. Barring a prediction or two from a local soothsayer, The Banshees of Inisherin contains no element of fantasy as such. But this latest bucolic tragicomedy from writer-director Martin McDonagh (Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri) has a quaint otherworldly flavour that suggests the chronicle of a squabble between hobbits. Though born and raised in London, McDonagh has made his Irish heritage go a long way. The action takes place in 1923, just off Ireland’s west coast; the fictional Inisherin is “played” by the real-life island of Inishmore, pictured as a jigsaw puzzle of lush green fields encircled by low-lying dry stone walls, much as it was in 1934 when Robert Flaherty arrived to shoot his pioneering docudrama Man of Aran. Famously, Flaherty was engaged in the kind of quest for authenticity that paid little heed to the truth – portraying his islanders as engaged in a constant battle for brute survival, even when not taking to the open sea for their allegedly traditional shark hunts. By contrast, McDonagh makes no claim to even the loosest kind of realism. His Inisherin is less a functioning community than an unlikely haven for slow-witted, middle-aged celibates dedicated to taking it easy. This viewer never quite managed to fathom how the gormless Padraic (Colin Farrell), a nominal cattle farmer sharing a two-room cottage with his sensible sister (Kerry Condon), manages to afford his nightly pints of Guinness and his pricey-looking knitwear. Whatever his duties entail, he has all the time in the world for what he calls “normal chats” with his best friend Colm (Brendan Gleeson) – until Colm, who wants more time for playing the fiddle, loses patience with his mate’s ramblings and warns Padraic never to speak to him again. “What are you, 12?” a neighbour says incredulously. That, if anything, is over-generous; as so often with McDonagh, the characters are basically overgrown pre-schoolers, whose impulsive choices have all too permanent consequences. A similar childish quality is evident in McDonagh’s own undimmed zest for cheap shock effects: anyone familiar with his past work will not be surprised to hear that the action turns increasingly gruesome, nor that there’s a subplot involving sexual abuse. No less standardised are the musical repetitions of the dialogue, which relies heavily on having the characters say “feck” whenever the pace starts to lag. In all these respects McDonagh isn’t too far from his American counterparts such as Quentin Tarantino or the Coen brothers – trafficking, as they do, in a menacing absurdism that can be traced back to the plays of Harold Pinter. But as an entertainer he doesn’t quite have the agility of his transatlantic cousins. The fanciful material of Banshees calls for a more visually stylised approach than anything he can muster. Without that, it’s hard to swallow the plot contrivances and tonal shifts of the film’s third act, let alone the vague hints of an allegory for the Irish Civil War. Still, the core subject here – the pain of rejection – is so close to universal that few viewers will fail to respond. Farrell’s pleading, puppyish features seem made to convey every shade of hurt and bafflement, and McDonagh puts them to work in close-up, as Padraic moves through the stages of grief in a manner both funny and heartbreaking. Is truth really the daughter of time? Josephine Tey’s celebrated 1951 novel based on that proverb has a Scotland Yard inspector, in hospital with a broken leg, trying to resolve the question of Richard III. I read The Daughter of Time in high school in an earlier century. I dimly remember its conclusions: that the popular vision of Richard as a hunchback who murdered the princes in the Tower was a lie planted by the Tudors and promoted by their pet playwright. Richard was nothing like the horseless psycho in Shakespeare’s play. Philippa Langley was one of these so-called Ricardians. When we meet her character in Stephen Frears’ patchy and polemical film, she is a tiny, sickly Edinburgh woman with two boys and an ex-husband, played by Steve Coogan. Coogan also co-wrote the script with Jeff Pope, reuniting the team that made Philomena. Sally Hawkins, an elfin treasure of the British screen, has never given a bad performance. Nor is this one, but she is ill-served by the team. In effect, the movie manipulates Langley’s story for its own ends, while accusing others of doing the same thing to Richard. The real Langley is a screenwriter, who began investigating Richard for a film project. No mention of that here. She was one of the initiators of The Richard Project, not a sole eccentric voice. She did wander into a council car park in Leicester and come over all funny when she saw the letter R on the asphalt. She has said repeatedly that she “felt” Richard was there, buried below. The movie ignores the fact that a historian suggested in 1975 that he was there. The church in which he was buried in 1485 had been demolished centuries earlier. Langley was pivotal in getting the agreement to dig. The Richard Project raised the money to pay an archaeological company, based at Leicester University, who thought the project would fail. When they did find Richard, the university bigwigs claimed the credit, shuffling Langley and the Ricardians aside. That part at least appears to have some truth. Frears and Coogan were outraged by this, so they construct a film about a battler winning against all odds. Langley has chronic fatigue syndrome. She identifies with the way Richard has been demonised for his condition – an easy metaphor. Hawkins quivers with indignation throughout, reaching a point where I thought she might break. Her performance does not lack commitment, just someone to guide it. How much human degradation and depravity is too much? Like the waiter in the Monty Python sketch about the overweight man in a restaurant, Swedish iconoclast Ruben Ostlund keeps offering us “just a wafer-thin slice” to take us over the edge, where discomfort becomes the point. He wants to make a movie that is worth leaving the house for. It’s basically a (longish) vomit-comet of cinematic bile and guile. For Ostlund, subtlety is overrated. Triangle of Sadness shows us why he has a point. It’s a spectacular demolition of modern life, a disruptor movie full of ideas and nuance, as violent in its way as a Pieter Bruegel painting. Ostlund grew up on a Swedish island, and his mother was a teacher and a communist. He has no difficulty in identifying the enemy. The surprise is how sympathetic he is once he has them up against the wall, squirming like an insect on a pin. A brief introduction throws us into the gorgeous lives of two models. Yaya (South African actress Charlbi Dean Kriek) earns four times as much as Carl (Harris Dickinson), but still expects him to pay for dinner. After a spectacular argument brings them closer, they board a super yacht as invited guests. Yaya is an influencer, accustomed to her beauty opening all doors. It’s her currency. The location is unclear, but it feels like the Mediterranean, somewhere near Greece. Ostlund assembles a basket of deplorables, most of whom are only there because they’re rich. An impeccably mannered English duo, cutely named Winston and Clementine (Oliver Ford Davies and Amanda Walker), enjoy a family fortune built on land mines and hand grenades. Fat Russian billionaire Dimitry (Zlatko Buric) declares proudly that “I sell shit”. His wife Vera (Sunnyi Melles), pickled in champagne, gives outlandish orders to the exquisitely polite crew: money buys obeisance. In his cabin, the alcoholic Marxist captain (Woody Harrelson) refuses to come out. When a storm hits the ship, the Marxist and the Russian capitalist get so trolleyed they take turns reading the Communist Manifesto over the PA. Meanwhile, most of the passengers are hurling the contents of the seven-course captain’s dinner. Then the sewage tanks overflow. Ostlund does not hold back: this is one of the most revolting (and hilarious) sequences in the history of movies, a brilliantly satirical square-up as nature overturns privilege. The survivors wash up on a deserted island. Neither beauty nor money means anything now. Abigail (Dolly De Leon), a Filipina who cleaned toilets on the ship, finds a new role. She knows how to fish. It’s like Gilligan’s Island meets The Hunger Games. Ostlund made some waves with Force Majeure and The Square. Triangle of Sadness bolts onto those as the grand finale of a trilogy about masculinity in trouble in a world without pity or moral compass. Force Majeure was about a family falling apart. Ostlund indicted the art world and its patrons in The Square. He dissects multiple forms of privilege here, from beauty to heredity to sheer dumb luck, but he does it with compassion. He loves the characters he tortures. There’s an emotionally powerful shot here, with one character crying over the body of another. Until this, both had seemed like empty shells, the victims of their own misbegotten fortune. Death and grief make them human again. What more is there to say about Whitney Houston, whose brilliant career, drug-taking and premature death has been hashed over exhaustively on screen and in the tabloids? I Wanna Dance with Somebody tackles that question by taking her story back to the music. It’s written by New Zealander Anthony McCarten, whose screenplay for Bohemian Rhapsody didn’t dilute the tragedies in Freddie Mercury’s short life while still managing to evoke the exhilaration to be had from Queen’s greatest concerts. It took a delicate touch and other rock stars haven’t been as fortunate. While Rocketman was just as exuberant in doing justice to Elton John as a performer, the Aretha Franklin biopic Respect (2021) became more depressing as it went on. The United States vs. Billie Holiday, also released last year, was the same. It was powerful but it was no celebration. Then there was Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, which was more glitz than heart, clouded by the decision to tell the tale from the venal viewpoint of Presley’s manager, Colonel Tom Parker. Members of Houston’s family were interviewed at length for a documentary four years ago. But for this film, also produced with the family’s co-operation, director Kasi Lemmons made extensive use of the singer’s original recordings, including those laid down en route to the final versions. It allowed star Naomi Ackie to take Houston’s false starts, double takes and spontaneous comments as prompts in shaping her performance. Although she was filmed singing, her voice was replaced by Houston’s. She does well, catching the contradictions in Houston’s character – the naivete, the fear of failure, the rebellious streak and its effect on her religious convictions. But physically, Ackie bears only a superficial resemblance to the singer. With Houston’s image still so fresh in the memory, this is a distraction. The script is impressionistic in style, covering a lot of ground by being selective and using Houston’s songs to drive the narrative. Much is made of her relationship with the record company chief Clive Davis (one of the film’s producers), who discovered Houston and helped her choose songs for her albums. He’s played by a wryly urbane Stanley Tucci, giving us a character whose iron fist is well covered in velvet. Appalled when Houston takes up smoking, he looks sadly at her as she lights up, remarking that it’s like watching a Stradivarius being left out in the rain. The film falls a little short of its claim to be warts-and-all, condensing the low points in Houston’s turbulent marriage to Bobby Brown (Ashton Sanders), but it doesn’t hold back in dealing with her father’s financial mismanagement. Nor does it underplay the importance of her enduring friendship with her former lover, Robyn Crawford – played with a lot of verve by Nafessa Williams. Roald Dahl was not the first storyteller to acknowledge many children’s taste for the macabre – the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen got there before him. But nobody has ever extracted as much fun from this discovery as Dahl has. Matilda Wormwood (Alisha Weir) is one of Dahl’s most popular creations – a small girl forced to survive as best she can in a world governed by some of the most malevolent grown-ups in children’s literature. Her parents (Andrea Riseborough and Stephen Graham) are bad enough – crass, venal and spiteful, with voices piercing enough to shatter glass – but Miss Trunchbull, headmistress of Crunchem Hall, the gothic house of horrors that is Matilda’s school, is worse. She’s a monster. Trunchbull was played by a man when Matilda: The Musical began its triumphal march across the world’s stages. When the screen adaptation was announced, it seemed the role would go to Ralph Fiennes. Instead, Trunchbull is brought hideously to life by an unrecognisable Emma Thompson. Her face looks as if it has been moulded out of concrete, while she stamps around her domain in a get-up with an unsettling resemblance to a stormtrooper uniform. Thompson abandoned her vanity long ago, but this creation goes quite a few grotesque steps further than her Nanny McPhee of the single bucktooth and hairy mole. Matilda is sent to Crunchem Hall because her parents don’t like having her around. She does her best to keep out of their way, having adopted the local mobile library as her second home. Librarian Mrs Phelps (Sindhu Vee) has become a substitute mother, as well as being a receptive audience for the stories spun by Matilda’s fertile imagination. The film is directed by Matthew Warchus, who is the artistic director of the Old Vic in London and worked on the original stage production. He has done a wonderful job transferring the musical’s energy to the screen. Two hundred children were recruited to portray Matilda’s schoolmates – or Crunchem’s “maggots”, as their headmistress refers to them – and their chorus work brings great vitality to Tim Minchin’s music and lyrics, which are crucial in advancing the plot and crystallising the mood of the film. They’re also gifted comedians adept at the slapstick that gives the choreography such charge. Eventually, the “maggots” all learn how to stand up to the execrable Trunchbull, as does her sweet-natured underling Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch). Despite his love of the sardonic, Dahl did believe in happy endings and Dennis Kelly’s script keeps the story’s dark and light sides in perfect balance. Twelve-year-old Weir does the same. It’s a performance in which innocence and intelligence are bound up with bravery and righteous anger. You cheer her all the way as she takes on the seemingly impossible. Apparently a classic in the US, the children’s book Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile wasn’t part of my childhood. But Will Speck and Josh Gordon’s new adaptation, a hybrid of live action and animation, felt almost familiar – starting out as a homage to the great Warner Brothers cartoon One Froggy Evening, then morphing into a bid to recreate the success of the genuinely charming Paddington films. Canadian singer Shawn Mendes supplies the voice of Lyle, a shy but musically gifted young crocodile who is discovered hiding out in the attic of a New York brownstone by the family that has just moved in. This is supposed to be an “elevated” children’s film, meaning we get Javier Bardem as a flamboyant magician, a suite of unmemorable songs from the team who worked on The Greatest Showman, and Adult Swim comic Brett Gelman playing a nosy neighbour named Mr Grumps with hipster irony. Less ironised is the core message, which appears to be the same one sometime Pixar songwriter Randy Newman satirised long ago in his novelty hit Simon Smith and the Amazing Dancing Bear: even rank outsiders can be accepted anywhere, provided they know how to sing and dance. Joel Crawford’s fully animated Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has a few more things going for it, at least for viewers like me who are easily won over by the notion of an intrepid marmalade cat who’s voiced by Antonio Banderas and can buckle a swash with the best of them. True, I can’t say I yearned to see this feline Zorro undergo a midlife crisis and face his own mortality. But given the character made his debut in Shrek 2 in 2004, it’s understandable that weariness would start to set in. Having used up all but one of his nine lives, Puss in Boots can only regain his mojo by embarking on a shamanistic spiritual quest through a psychedelic landscape where his fears manifest in physical form (the painterly style, influenced by anime, makes a change from the usual “photorealistic” approach). Hot on his tail is a parade of villains, including the menacing Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and a Cockney version of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) who has turned the three bears into her criminal sidekicks but still yearns for the day when everything will be “just right”. There are a fair number of amusing moments along the way, but also a few scenes that may alarm younger viewers. (One of these, involving carnivorous flowers, I found pretty creepy myself.)",NEUTRAL

"Dec 23, 2022"," Oscar-winning filmmaker Damien Chazelle wants to have it both ways. He wants “Babylon” to be a celebration of the decadent excesses of Old Hollywood as well as a condemnation of the era. It doesn’t work. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie are fine in this overly ambitious epic that focuses on the awkward period of transition from silent film to talkies. It plays like a lewd and salacious re-invention of “Singing in the Rain.” The last scenes go completely off the rails. “Babylon” is way too much and not enough at the same time. A strong performance from Naomi Ackie and a killer soundtrack elevate the otherwise standard showbiz biopic, “Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance with Somebody.” The singer’s tragic life story should have been much more compelling, but thanks to that voice and those songs, it’s still an entertaining tribute to the pop music diva. The animated sequel “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is exactly what you’d expect. Antonio Banderas is back as the voice of the swashbuckling feline but this time, he realizes that he’s used up eight of his nine lives. It’s a pleasant enough time-waster for undiscerning kids. Impressive performances from Brendan Fraser and a solid supporting cast make the stagey drama “The Whale” worth a look. Fraser plays Charlie, a morbidly obese gay man who struggles to reconnect with his estranged daughter. Frasier is getting most of the attention, but Sadie Sink is one of the best young actors working today and all her scenes work. Hong Chau is fine as Charlie’s nurse and Samantha Morton impresses in the brief role of Charlie’s ex-wife. Thanks to the cast, “The Whale” manages to mine some pathos despite its dispiriting story.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2022"," 
When Puss in Boots first appeared in 2004's Shrek 2, he didn't seem like a character who could sustain his own long-running franchise. The swashbuckling cat voiced by Antonio Banderas was comic relief in a movie already full of comedy, providing a bit of flair when he showed up onscreen. Eighteen years later, Puss is still around, and the new Puss in Boots: The Last Wish proves that he's still entertaining to watch, thanks in large part to Banderas' charismatic vocal performance.
 
There's no need to be familiar with Puss' previous adventures to enjoy The Last Wish, and the only other returning character is Puss' rival and love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Longtime series fans hoping to see Shrek, Fiona and Donkey may be disappointed, but the filmmakers offer some new additions to the franchise's twisted fairy-tale world.
 
Between his 2011 movie and his six-season Netflix series (which starred a different voice actor), Puss has done a lot of living, and as The Last Wish opens, he learns that he is on the last of his nine lives. The bold, daring Puss turns timid, hiding out in the home of a cat hoarder after faking his own final death.
 
Puss doesn't get to hide out for long before he's tracked by Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears, who have been reimagined as something out of a Guy Ritchie movie. They're looking to recruit Puss for a job stealing a magical map from Jack Horner (John Mulaney), the little boy who once put his finger in a pie and has grown up to be a hulking pie mogul obsessed with collecting magical objects. Goldilocks, Jack and Kitty all want the map so it can lead them to the final remaining wishing star and grant them a single wish. Puss, too, decides he needs to find the star, so he can restore his lives and regain his swagger.
 
The heist sequence inside Jack's pie factory is creative and fun, with the franchise's signature mix of elements from old-fashioned fairy tales and modern movies. From there, Puss and Kitty set out to find the star, deep in an enchanted forest, pursued by Goldilocks and the bears, Jack and his henchmen, and a creepy hooded wolf (Wagner Moura) who's the embodiment of death itself. At the aforementioned cat hoarder's house, Puss picks up a new sidekick, a yappy little dog he calls Perrito (What We Do in the Shadows' Harvey Guillen), who's eager to become best friends with Puss and Kitty.
 
There's a lot going on in The Last Wish, with three separate adversaries for Puss, and the movie could stand to be a bit more streamlined. It's amusing to see the three bears (voiced by Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) as British-accented criminals, but their arc is underwhelming and largely superfluous. Screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow introduce some surprisingly heavy themes about facing mortality, and there are affecting moments amid the chaotic comedy. Banderas and Hayek have appealing chemistry as the feline lovers with a checkered history, and Puss' character growth feels genuine without being overstated.

"Dec 22, 2022"," That swashbuckling feline, aka the “macho gato,” is back charming audiences in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” And I can happily report, it’s the cat’s meow. Like the 2011 original, “Puss” is one of those rare kid flicks that entertains the pint-sized as much as it does their parents. It arrives loaded with colorful characters, magic carpets, sword fights and perilous falls, all for the kids. But the script adds another layer of humor brimming with cultural references keenly attuned to grownups.  The script cleverly weaves the spirit of several fairy tales and nursery rhymes, as Puss and Perro hit the road on what could be the cat’s last adventure. Several storybook A-listers show up along the way, including Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo), and ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Making the situation stickier is the arrival of Puss’ spurned former flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), whom he hasn’t seen since the events of the last film. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2022"," As voiced by Antonio Banderas, the swashbuckling, Zorro-like feline Puss in Boots was originally introduced in 2005’s SHREK 2. Since then, Puss (with Banderas’s voice) has appeared in two more SHREK sequels and a bunch of shorts, and got his own PUSS IN BOOTS movie back in 2011. Now Puss toplines his second theatrical, PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH. Students of feline lore know that cats have nine lives. Puss has plenty of panache and bravado, and loves putting on a show for adoring villagers. But he’s been careless, and is bad with math. When he learns that he’s used up eight of his lives, Puss panics. After getting a shaky handle on his fears, Puss recalls the legend of the Wishing Star, which will grant a single wish to whoever finds it. He resolves to get the map that points the way to the star, so that he can wish for more lives. Puss soon encounters his old love interest/partner Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault), and can’t shake a determinedly friendly chihuahua (voiced by Harvey Guillén). Their competition for possession of the map includes the crime family of Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (voiced by Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), plus the villainous Big Jack Horner (voiced by John Mulaney). For added scares, a wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura, who played Pablo Escobar on NARCOS) is also after Puss for other reasons. There is of course humor in PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH, but there’s also a serious streak. The hero’s journey for Puss here includes a lot of shame. Most movies aimed at families don’t include quite so much contemplation of the gap between one’s self-image and the person one has ultimately turned out to be. There’s also a whole riff about interracial adoption with Goldie and the bears that actually gets discussed, rather than just hanging in the subtext, issues of trust and mortality, and more. PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH is action-packed and highly colorful, with great gags now and then, although some require reading the end credits. It’s unclear if the Jiminy Cricket-like “Ethical Bug,” voiced James Stewart-style by Kevin McCann, is so named because of rights issues with all of the PINOCCHIO movies coming out this year, or if the filmmakers just thought it was funny. For lovers of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS, there’s also a nice meta joke, since Guillén’s SHADOWS character has a crush on Banderas. Banderas is perfectly on point as Puss, Guillén is adorable, Hayek is cool, Mulaney is suitably hateful, and Colman is the Mama Bear everyone wishes they had. PUSS IN BOOTS: THE LAST WISH is imaginative and lively, but a little darker than we might expect. There’s as much or more here for grownups as for kids.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2022"," The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the “Shrek” universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He’s a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land—but he’s also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. “The Last Wish” expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original “Puss in Boots.” Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado’s film. The film’s aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss’ whiskers blowing in the wind, “The Last Wish” offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. The story begins with a debauched bacchanal (featuring kegs filled with leche) that’s more convincing than the opening orgy in “Babylon.” Puss in Boots is naturally front and center, singing his heart out, partying it up—but eventually, he must go on the run when he realizes that bounty hunter The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is after him, and he’s down to the last of his nine lives. (The zippy montage revealing the many ways he’s died is packed with witty, little asides.) FYI for parents and caretakers of little kids: The Big Bad Wolf is essentially The Grim Reaper. He’s relentless, and he’s terrifying. Faking his death, Puss seeks shelter at a cramped cat refuge run by Randolph’s sweetly doting Mama Luna. Watching the arrogant, preening feline struggle to assimilate into a mundane world of dry food and shared litter boxes is hilarious, and the angles through which we experience his reluctant transformation put us inside his head. But it’s here that Puss meets an unlikely ally: a scruffy, crazy-eyed Chihuahua pretending to be a cat because he has nowhere else to go. We come to know him as Perrito, and he’s played with scene-stealing sweetness by Harvey Guillen (“What We Do in the Shadows”). In a stacked voice cast, Guillen’s performance emerges as the unexpected highlight. Perrito’s unflappable innocence and enthusiasm in the face of danger are infectious, but he also provides the film with some of its most deeply emotional moments. Again, the darker parts of “The Last Wish” may disturb young viewers. When Puss’ former rival and flame Kitty Softpaws shows up (voiced once again with sarcastic, flirtatious charm by Hayek Pinault), the three go on a mission to find the mythical Wishing Star to restore Puss’ nine lives. The magical map that takes them there suggests a wildly divergent and amusing variety of paths, depending on who’s holding it. But they’re not the only ones seeking the map and the power of the Wishing Star. Also on their tail are Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Pugh, Winstone, Colman, and Samson Kayo), who are now a bickering, Cockney-voiced crime syndicate straight out of a Guy Ritchie movie. (The idea of Winstone and Colman playing Pugh’s parents in any format is irresistible, and we need more of this.) And in the least developed supporting part, Mulaney plays the gluttonous gang boss “Big” Jack Horner, a towering figure who collects rare, fairy-tale objects like Cinderella’s glass slipper and baby unicorn horns. After a roaring start, “The Last Wish” sags a bit in the midsection as it becomes clear that we’re in for a pretty standard quest from this script by  Paul Fisher (“The Croods: A New Age”) and Tommy Swerdlow (2018’s “The Grinch”). Of course, everyone’s after everyone else, and they’re all after the same thing, with some funny and frightening obstacles along the way. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn’t feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won’t need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.

"Dec 22, 2022"," In 2011, I accused the first movie in the “Puss in Boots” franchise of neutering the once-charming character. We fell in love with the frisky feline, as voiced by Antonio Banderas, in the “Shrek” movies, but his journey from supporting to leading character was far from purrfect. The movies were predictable and worse, had none of the purr-sonality (OK. I’ll stop with the cat puns now) of the “Shrek” movies. Now, one television series, sequel and video game later, comes “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” a movie, now playing in theatres, that raises the stakes. The new film opens with the plucky ginger cat (once again voiced by Banderas) in a life-or-death battle against a fur-midable (last one, I promise) opponent. “I am known by many names,” he brags. “Stabby Tabby. El Macho Gato. The Leche Whisperer. I am Puss in Boots!” Rather than become a lap-cat, the swashbuckling Puss, along with love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and chatty therapy dog Perro (Harvey Guillén), sets off to into the Black Forest to find the mystical Last Wish and restore the lives he lost. “I need to get my lives back,” he says. “Without them, I am not the legend.” But after eight lives lived, Puss has many enemies, all of whom want track him down. “I find the idea of nine lives absurd,” says the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), “and you didn’t value any of them.” Animation is generally thought of as entertainment for kids, but legends like Don Bluth and Ralph Bakshi made their careers creating films that addressed darker subject matter. Now, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is no “The Secret of Nimh” or “Fire and Ice,” but it is bleaker and more experimental than anything else in the franchise. Like the recent “Guillermo Del Toro’s Pinocchio,” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” treads into adult territory theme wise, with higher stakes than we’re used to in a film aimed at kids– the Cave of Lost Souls, anyone?—but does so with family audiences in mind. The character of PiB may be in peril, but the flamboyance that made him such a scene stealer in “Shrek 2” is still on full display. He’s a huge personality in pocket-size, and Banderas brings a perfect combination of roguishness and righteousness to the voice work. Fun, villainous voice work from Florence Pugh, John Mulaney, and Wagner Moura, as Goldilocks, “Big” Jack Horner and Big Bad Wolf / Death respectively, add some spice and beautiful animation lifts the adventure sequences skyward. Best of all, the film’s underlying life lesson, that time is precious and we should enjoy it while we can—”When you only have one life,” says Kitty Softpaws, “that’s what makes it special.”—is nicely woven into the film’s fleet-footed, if slightly predictable plot.

"Dec 22, 2022"," La secuela tardía de 'El Gato con Botas' presenta una estética renovada y nuevos personajes que dan una nueva vida a la franquicia de DreamWorks Animation. Y todo con la muerte como tema principal. ""Esta historia es un cuento de hadas"". Con este mensaje DreamWorks Animation nos da la bienvenida de nuevo a un mundo en el que Pinocho y los tres cerditos pueden montarse un fiestón en la ciénaga de un otro malhumorado cuyo mejor amigo es un asno parlante casado con una dragona. Más de una década llevamos sin pisar ese mundo, y sin ver a uno de los personajes favoritos de la franquicia, el primero en lograr su propio spin-off. Sí, 'El gato con botas: el último deseo' es un cuento de hadas, quizás el mayor cuento de hadas que ha visto la saga. Y también uno de los capítulos más estimulantes de la historia reciente del estudio. El Gato con Botas vuelve tan enamorado de sí mismo como siempre. El personaje de Antonio Banderas sigue encandilando a las masas y viviendo aventuras sin pensar mucho en las consecuencias. Hasta que un día descubre que ha agotado ocho de sus nueve vidas, por lo que si muere una vez más será el fin. Pero hay una última esperanza: si encuentra la estrella de los deseos que cayó en el Bosque Lúgubre puede pedir que se restablezcan las vidas que ha perdido y volver a ser el temerario espadachín que es leyenda en todo el reino. Pero el camino no será fácil. Le esperan nuevos enemigos y algún que otro inesperado aliado.Lo primero que salta a la vista cuando empieza la película es el cambio visual que han dado el protagonista y todo su entorno. DreamWorks ha desechado una simple actualización del estilo de animación de la anterior 'El gato con botas' y en su lugar han apostado por una estética que recuerda a acuarelas, infinitamente más bucólica y evocadora que la animación por ordenador más habitual. Aquí se permiten jugar con las texturas, con los tonos y con las figuras para darnos una de las películas más bonitas del estudio, con muchos planos dignos de pararse a admirar en detalle. Los personajes que ya conocíamos resultan completamente reconocibles con estos nuevos aspectos, volviéndose más expresivos (por ejemplo con el brillo de los ojos), y las nuevas incorporaciones encuentran ese equilibrio entre un diseño que encaja con la saga pero que sabe sacar partido a los nuevos visuales, especialmente Ricitos de Oro y el lobo feroz. Nunca la franquicia había resultado tan mágica, estéticamente hablando.No solo han decidido salirse de las líneas en los diseños de escenarios y personajes, también han reventado el ritmo y los encuadres para darnos escenas frenéticas que parecen salidas de un anime, cambios de color y efectos que cie recuerdan más a las viñetas de un cómic que a una película de 'Shrek'. Es un gran salto cualitativo para un estudio que quiere romper con sus propios cánones. Que una compañía tan consolidada esté apostando por dar libertad creativa a cada título (como pasó con 'Los tipos malos') es una buenísima noticia para el futuro de la animación de Hollywood.Narrativamente, 'El último deseo' es muy superior a la película previa del Gato con Botas. Tommy Swerdlow, Tom Wheeler y Paul Fisher se ponen existencialistas y hablan de la muerte y de las cosas importantes de la vida, haciendo crecer al protagonista partiendo de sus rasgos más característicos. Aprovechando eso de las nueve vidas que tiene un gato según los cuentos anglosajones (siete en España), Gato pasa de temerario a cobardica, llegando a plantearse abandonar su vida de leyenda y convertirse en un animal de compañía común y corriente. Buscar la salida fácil con ayuda de la magia es algo que le pega mucho, y obviamente es una de las lecciones que tendrá que aprender en el camino en busca de la estrella: los atajos suelen salir mal. Todo englobado en un genial homenaje al spaghetti western de lo más entretenido.Perros y lobosNo es la primera película para niños que trata el tema de la muerte, pero 'El último deseo' sabe hacerlo de una manera sencilla y entretenida, incidiendo en lo importante de haber tenido una buena vida y haberla compartido con la gente que queremos. En ese sentido destaca Perro como uno de los mejores personajes de la película, y eso que prácticamente todas las caras nuevas son muy destacables. El chihuahua que se hace pasar por gato es la pureza personificada. Un personaje adorable con un espíritu inquebrantable, lo opuesto a Gato. Una mezcla entre el cansinamente encantador Asno y una nube de azúcar que podría haber sido como un dolor de muelas, pero que consigue alcanzar el corazón de Gato, de Kitty, y probablemente el de muchos de nosotros. En contraposición tenemos al malvado lobo feroz, que representa lo más cerca que ha estado Gato de la muerte. Estéticamente es el personaje más resultón de la película, las peleas contra él son muy épicas. Hacía mucho que un villano de una película animada no daba tanto miedito como este, llegamos a sentir el peligro como lo hace Gato cada vez que le oímos silbar. Un villano fantástico.Y no es el único. La película ha rebuscado en los confines de este mundo de cuentos para encontrar un personaje que fuera de Reino Unido no nos sonará de nada. Jack Horner es el protagonista de una nana tradicional, y su gran talento es haber conseguido sacar una ciruela de una tarta. Esa falta de magia le ha vuelto un obseso de todo lo relacionado con ella, y su gran deseo para la estrella es conseguir toda la magia del reino. Es un niño grande malcriado, el enemigo tontaco para contrastar la intensidad del lobo. Y por otro lado tenemos a Ricitos de Oro y los tres osos, una familia de villanos con una interesantísima historia que nos recuerda que a veces no hace falta buscar muy lejos para encontrar lo que anhelamos. Todos ellos son personajes con evolución, con trasfondo, y todos ellos están estupendamente doblados por actores de doblaje profesionales, que además aparecen bien destacados en los títulos de crédito, como tendría que ser siempre. Banderas sigue dotando a la estrella de la historia de todo el encanto y humor que necesita.La saga 'Shrek' llevaba muchos años hibernando, pero 'El gato con botas: El último deseo' ha conseguido que recupere ese brillo que quizás no veíamos desde la segunda aventura del ogro, en la que precisamente conocimos a Gato. La película no solo consigue mejorar en prácticamente todo a la primera historia en solitario del personaje, sino que sabe cómo hacer para dar nueva vida a este universo de cuentos, con más de un guiño por el camino y sin perder el sentido del humor. Eso sí, se echa de menos un poco más de la comedia irreverente de las películas del ogro, esta tiene un corte tirando a más infantil a pesar del tema central. Con esta película DreamWorks refleja que no se quieren estancar, que tienen grandes ideas y que podemos esperar cosas muy interesantes de cara a al futuro, sobre todo si han podido resucitar con tanta fuerza una franquicia como esta.'El gato con botas: El último deseo' ya está en cines.Nota: 8Lo mejor: El cambio estético es una preciosidad y encaja perfectamente con la franquicia.

Its lead character, the suave sword-fighting cat based on Zorro, was introduced to the “Shrek” universe back in 2004, a.k.a. slightly after the big bang. The big bang in American animation was “Shrek” itself, an anti-fairytale from 2001 that took its studio, DreamWorks Animation, into the big leagues. It changed the animation game both stylistically, moving away from hand-drawn work into computer animation, and tonally. Shrek was a disgusting ogre who behaved the exact opposite to the picture-perfect characters from a mouse-themed studio. The movie itself was chock full of pop-culture references (bored parents laugh out loud but the references don’t usually age well), it cast famous actors as the characters which permanently altered how animation has been performed since, and furthermore its knowing, snide tone has also been aped by most of non-Disney kids’ movies released in its wake. Once upon a time, all that was fresh, but kids who saw Puss in Boots debut in “Shrek 2” in 2004 have their own kids now. Puss in Boots was the franchise’s breakout star because of Antonio Banderas. Here is an actor who went to the trouble of being born in Spain, developed an avant-garde career alongside Pedro Almodóvar, then learned another language and broke into Hollywood in 1993 by being brave enough to play gay alongside Tom Hanks in “Philadelphia” when that was tantamount to career suicide. After that he played a vampire (alongside Tom Cruise), an action hero, a musical theater narrator and Zorro himself (in 1998’s pretty decent “The Mask of Zorro” with Catherine Zeta-Jones at her peak). But it wasn’t until he dropped his voice an octave to voice Puss in Boots that his career achieved its first huge success. This is why Hollywood can be a very silly place. On the other hand, something charming and cheerful that shuts the kids up for a few hours has a lot of value. To the plot! In the dark forest, there’s rumored to be the resting place of the wishing star, which will grant whoever finds it a wish. Puss needs this wish, after a fight with a forest giant (clearly inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli) in which he uses up the eighth of his nine lives. On realizing he has only one life left, Puss has what can only be described as a midlife crisis, not helped by learning there’s a wolf bounty hunter (Wagner Moura, delicious) hot on his tail. After a short interlude in a cat sanctuary modeled after Kurtz’s compound in “Apocalypse Now,” Puss learns of a map that leads to the wishing star. But the map is held by greedy man-child Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), and also being sought by the Cockney crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh, excellent) and the three bears: Papa (old reliable Ray Winstone), Mama (Olivia Colman, who was presumably offered the part when the producers realized Kathy Burke has retired from acting) and Baby (Samson Kayo). (Sidebar: you can guess the screenwriters Paul Swerdlow and Tommy Fisher are Americans since they leave out all the many, many possible jokes about Brexit and Brits in Spain.) After a colossal battle in which Horner’s large home full of every possible magical device is destroyed, the chase is on. Puss finds himself with the map and two new travelling companions: Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault, reprising her 2011 character) and Perrito (Harvey Guillén, basically reprising his “What We Do in the Shadows” character). Perrito is a goofy-looking sock-wearing chihuahua who infiltrated the cat sanctuary in disguise for the free food and who mistook Puss’s minor politeness there as friendship. His backstory is so grim Puss and Kitty actually cover their mouths in shock when he reveals it, but Perrito is such an innately cheerful character he overlooks the true horror of what happened to him, meaning the real import is likely to sail over little heads as well. The map’s gimmick – in that the route through the dark forest is the same, but the obstacles are different depending on who is holding it – is an excellent one. Horner’s big evil motivations – he was brought up with everything a person needs but will never have everything he wants – are sharply written for the current moment. A little magic bug, not quite Jiminy Cricket, who attempts to be Horner’s conscience, is voiced by Kevin McCann in the style of Jimmy Stewart, providing the main laugh-out-loud moments in the film. It’s unlikely kids will get that joke, though. But there aren’t too many jokes in this movie. It’s a sweet and beautiful-looking attempt to encourage the audience to respect the one life they have and spend it having a nice time with their friends. That is, of course, magnificently done, but there is so much casual violence and cruelty along the way that the message is nearly lost. When most of Horner’s henchmen, the bakers’ dozen, are incapacitated, Horner looks down at a woman clinging for her life to the edge of the cliff and asks, “Are you chatty?” When she shakes her head, he saves her. There are also too many people shot in the backside with baby-unicorn horns before exploding into a ball of glitter for it to be truly amusing. The war against the video-gamification of violence in film for kids was lost years ago, but this casual disrespect is certainly a mixed message for a movie trying to teach the audience to appreciate their one and only life. Director Joel Crawford has worked his way up at DreamWorks; this is his 12th movie with them and second as director, so he’s got the house style by heart by now. And despite these criticisms, it’s by far their best offering in a very long time. It’s also clear in watching “Puss in Boots” and “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” back to back just how much Hollywood has changed. Violence remains acceptable as long as there isn’t any blood, while since the last decade romance has been nearly phased out. Are there even kisses in kids’ movies anymore? In both voice casting and as animated presences there’s care given to how ethnicities are portrayed (no more Welsh women playing Mexicans, even if they’re dark-haired). Women are no longer window dressing but are equal players in the cast – there are even dumb female henchmen these days. The animation is so good the animators must set themselves new challenges with every film: Here it’s most visible when Puss’s hair stands on end in fright. A lot of these changes are downright refreshing, except the heteronormativity, but we can’t have everything. But most of the core messages stay the same: Families come together, evil is fought and sassy remarks are made in the face of danger. This is a pretty good movie that makes clear how far and how fast Hollywood has come, but even with anthropomorphized animals teaching life lessons to little kids, we still have further to go.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2022"," Compared to other animated heroes, the dauntless Puss in Boots is quite the charismatic catch. The marmalade-colored tabby cat has caballero swagger for days and a swordsman’s courage inside those ebony wellingtons and underneath his wide-brimmed, feather-crested hat. Lest we forget, he’s got those eyes–oh my, those eyes– and the soothing rasp of Antonio Banderas modulating his every word. Hubba hubba! What more could you want? The answer is, quite unexpectedly, character depth beyond the easy archetype. Storytellers like those making the long-distance sequel Puss in Boots: The Last Wish could very easily have left the character born from the centuries-old Giovanni Francesco Straparola fairy tale ageless like Mickey Mouse. Instead, we have a mirthful movie that dares to dangle introspective yarn balls of fear, mortality, trust, friendship, and more towards our devil-may-care feline and the movie’s eager audience. To quote the well-worn expression used in many frank judgments of character, “I didn’t think he had it in him.” Be ready to color yourself surprised. Thanks to heightened stakes and those aforementioned honest themes, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish gallops beyond the flashy shell of a cash grab sequel opportunity for Dreamworks Animation. This valuable new journey massages and improves the mettle of this excellent character without losing a whisker of derring-do. In the years since we last saw him, Puss in Boots has enjoyed the perks and pitfalls of the outlaw lifestyle. Slurping his leche and singing of his own legend, Puss is celebrated by his adoring proletariat public while still being very much a wanted man. When an opening skirmish ends with him crushed by a falling church bell, the local doctor (lucious Jane the Virgin narrator Anthony Mendez) informs Puss that he is on the last of his nine lives and recommends immediate retirement. After receiving this diagnosis and wellness prescription, the cocky gato who laughs in the face of danger meets The Big Bad Wolf (The Gray Man’s Wagner Moura), whistling and stalking bounties with his twin sickles. After losing a sword fight to the lupine Grim Reaper smelling his fresh fear, Puss jarringly realizes his fragile mortality and flees. He buries his trademark costume– feeling he is no longer worthy– and joins Mama Luna’s (Da’Vine Joy Randolph of Dolemite is My Name) rescue house to seek obscurity interrupted often by a discarded clinger dog (Harvey Guillén of What We Do in the Shadows). Using the anonymous classic poem “Star light, star bright” as a catalyst, this animated Shrek realm contains the remnants of a fallen star protected by a dark forest. An individual guided by a magical map to this exotic destination will be granted the star’s single Last Wish. The greedy and hopeful have sought this myth for years, including the brutish collector of magic items “Big” Jack Horner (comedian John Mulaney). The butt-of-a-nursery-rhyme-joke’s newest pursuit brings new and old adversaries out of the woodwork. Former flame Kitty Softpaws (Banderas’ Desperado squeeze Salma Hayek Pinault) and the crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) all seek the map and its advertised promise. Their entry and Puss’s own chance at gaining back his lost lives pulls the titular hero back into the scamper for the star. All of these reunited rival thieves share tenuous familiarity. In this crowd, the warranted insufficient trust guards each against betrayal and prevents genuine friendships. However, as we all know, “you have to trust somebody,” just as the movie loves to state. Sanding away the competitive jealousy, especially between Kitty and Puss, becomes an essential step of growth for the protagonists. Thanks to a flamenco-tinged score from Brazilian composer and guitar virtuoso Heitor Pereira (the Despicable Me series) for Puss and Boots: The Last Wish, the spirited “holy frijoles” energy of the returning character has not diminished since 2011. New thrills and spills bring forth a peppy soundtrack of songs to fit the up-and-down moods of given moments, like Banderas crooning the original “Fearless Hero” to announce his presence or Dan Navarro’s sly Spanish cover of “The End” by The Doors telegraphing the retirement epiphany. The stick-sword (you’ll see in the movie) that stirs the drink of this sequel is still Antonio Banderas. His vocal braggadocio has ample room to still poke the drama necessary of his character’s crisis of mortality. He is joined by a very game supporting cast. Moura will spook you and Mulaney hits the right vile notes as heavies. Between Puss and Boots: The Last Wish and The Mitchells vs. The Machines last year, it’s a treat to see a decorated serious actress like Olivia Colman embrace animation opportunities. She and Winstone bring their chatty cockney to Pugh’s Oxford English and make a pleasant trio of banter. Without beating an agenda into the ground, the story and screenplay team of Tommy Swerdlow (The Grinch), Tom Wheeler (Dora and the Lost City of Gold), and Paul Fisher (The Lego Ninjago Movie), along with director Joel Crawford (The Croods: A New Age) and co-director Januel P. Mercado, push back more than a little vain masculinity inherent inside of Puss in Boots. We’ve got a character who has stopped to see himself and re-examine how others see him as well. That character can still choose manliness as a core, but improve it in several distinguishing ways (other than growing a beard that window-dresses newfound real maturity). This final lesson is one of those ways. Out of everyone chasing the Last Wish, it’s the naive little dog– sauntering in no hurry whatsoever with bad guys on his tail– that gets the simple truth. He has friends that did not require magic or a wish to gain. Being with them is fulfillment enough. This happiness without wishes is a factual reminder for the over-driven characters of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. That appreciation for life is an ideal message for viewers too and can create more zest than any slashing and clanging of blades.

"Dec 22, 2022"," When his gleeful celebration of himself awakens the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is quick to fell it in front of cheering crowds.  But after a dislodged bell lands on him, Puss is startled to learn he’s used up 8 of his 9 lives and The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is coming for him with dual scythes.  Puss tries to retire in anonymity, but upon learning of a map that points to a wish hidden in the Dark Forest, he buckles his swash and sets out to secure it for himself in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” When his gleeful celebration of himself awakens the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is quick to fell it in front of cheering crowds.  But after a dislodged bell lands on him, Puss is startled to learn he’s used up 8 of his 9 lives and The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is coming for him with dual scythes.  Puss tries to retire in anonymity, but upon learning of a map that points to a wish hidden in the Dark Forest, he buckles his swash and sets out to secure it for himself in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” It has been a while since we’ve experienced the world of Shrek, but while the green ogre doesn’t appear here, other fairy tale characters join the race to procure the prize left by the Wishing Star with a story by “Puss in Boots’s” Tommy Wheeler and Tommy Swerdlow (""The Grinch”) that plays like a ‘choose your own adventure’ video game inspired by “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.”
After the musical opening featuring the cocksure Puss we know and love, we suddenly find a gato knocked down a few pegs by a Doctor (Anthony Mendez) who reminds him of all the lives he treated carelessly, the counting down of Puss’s prior deaths a comedic highlight.  After a run in with The Big Bad Wolf, a red-eyed beast in a black hooded cloak who suggests something grim (Grimm?) and to whom he loses his sword, Puss buries the remains of his identity and erects a giant ‘P’ over the grave.  He arrives at local cat lady Mama Luna’s (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) where he is renamed Pickles and hopes to be left alone (a cover of The Doors ‘The End’ plays on the soundtrack), but attracts the attention of a miniature mutt disguised with a felt cat hat whom he dubs Perro ('What We Do in the Shadows'' Harvey Guillén).  But Puss’s disguise proves short-lived when the Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears crime family discover his ruse and soon they are all vying for the map rumored to be held by Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney).  Puss will be the most surprised to see who’s beaten them to the punch – his old rival and romantic interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).
Directors Joel Crawford (""The Croods: A New Age"") and Januel Mercado largely lean on the type of CGI we’re accustomed to in Shrek world, mixing things up a bit with animated maps which change depending on whose hand or paw rests upon it that appear hand drawn and a more stylized, angular look for Puss when he faces off with the Wolf.  While the story leans on such clichés as families built by circumstance (Goldilocks learns that life with Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman) and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) is ‘just right’ after all, for example), its mixture of Western concepts with fairy tale characters lends many chuckles.  Horner, an odious looking creature and bully of a bakery shop owner, enlists his ‘Bakers’ Dozen,’ a motley crew bearing twelve different weapons, but also hosts Ethical Bug, a cricket in a top hat who sounds like Jimmy Stewart and is aghast by the conscience he attempts to guide.  There are references to Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz and Puss’s infamous cute eyes are given an amusing upgrade when Perrito, as he comes to be known, pops a blood vessel when he finally succeeds in making them.
And it is Perrito who is the scene stealer here, the upbeat oddball with the heartbreaking history a serious game changer for the franchise.  After eleven years, we can hear the aging in Banderas’s voice, Puss even given a long white beard for the film’s midsection, but there’s life in this old cat yet and the filmmakers land on just the right note to pivot into a new adventure.

Puss (Antonio Banderas) has lived as a swashbuckling adventurer always willing to put his life on the line for good, and sometimes not so good, reasons. But this comes at a cost and our feline hero has used up eight of his nine lives. The Grim Reaper, in the guise of the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), is coming for the cat in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.”
When we meet our feline hero, he is vanquishing yet another foe. Then, he sees he is being pursued by a very large wolf with not very nice intentions. This begins Puss’s story of his fall from legend and descent into the realm of “lap cat.” While living his new, docile life in the home of uber cat owner Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), he meets a small dog, Perro (Harvey Guillen), disguised as a cat.
Things are not exactly exciting in his new home and there is no adventure. That changes when Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bear Crime family – Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Coleman) and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) - come looking for Puss to collect the sizable bounty on his head.
Unintentionally, they let the cat out of the bag, so to speak, when they reveal a map to the Wishing Star that grants a single wish. Puss’s new mission is to find the star and make the wish that will get his lost lives back. But, everyone else, including Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), wants the wish for themselves and for their own selfish reasons.
Enter Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss’s old squeeze who he left at the altar – he thinks. But, she also wants the map for her own reasons. So, now, Puss, Kitty, Big Jack, Goldi and the Bear syndicate all want the precious map. There is one problem: depending on the viewer, the map will show a different path to the Wishing Star. All are bad and very dangerous, except for Perro, whom Kitty affectionately names Perrito.
The players in this game all want the wish for selfish reasons so you can guess that good will triumph over bad and a good heart is the best thing ever. There is a lot of mashing up of fairy tales and that keeps the viewer busy in an amusing way.

"Dec 22, 2022"," I have a very clear memory of watching 2004’s Shrek 2, seeing (and hearing) the new character of Puss in Boots for the first time, and thinking “Well, that’s my new favorite character in this franchise.” And that really hasn’t changed in nearly 20 years. Voiced by Antonio Banderas and clearly parodying his swashbuckling persona from the Zorro movies (with a little bit of a nod to his Mariachi character from Desperado and Once Upon A Time in Mexico), Puss eventually got his own solo film in 2011, and it has been far too long for the followup, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish, in which the feline adventurer realizes that he has burnt through eight of his nine lives, and it may be time to hang up the rapier and boots or risk dying permanently. That’s right: a family-friendly animated movie that seriously contemplates mortality, and it’s exactly what the holiday season needs this year. In his version of retirement, Puss ends up in a type of old cats’ home run by the kindly Mama Luna (Da'vine Joy Randolph), where he meets an overly excited dog disguised as a cat, named Perrito (What We Do in the Shadows’ Harvey Guillen, a great new addition to this universe), who seems all too eager to become Puss’s new best (and very clingy) friend. Puss finds out about the faraway Black Forest where he can find the mythical Wishing Star. If someone makes it through several obstacles along the way, they can make any wish they want, and Puss very much wants to wish for nine more lives. He enlists the help of his old lady friend Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and begins his new journey. But others want that wish as well, including the villainous Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who really is a right bastard, as well as the mercenary crime family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman as Mama, Ray Winstone as Papa, and Samson Kayo as Baby). In addition, the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is tracking down Puss, looking ominously like the figure of Death as he does so. At first, Puss keeps it a secret that he’s going to take the wish for himself, despite the fact that Kitty needs it for her own, slightly less selfish reasons. But after a while, Puss learns the benefit of actually becoming friends with his traveling companions, and they are able to make it through the obstacles as a team. Directed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift, the creative team behind The Croods: A New Age, the new Puss In Boots film is wildly funny, slightly demented, and reminds us that Banderas is an unsung, underrated comedy genius (watch his performance from earlier this year in Official Competition for additional, definitive proof), and there’s something extra special when he and Hayek team up. But the scene-stealing star of this film is Guillen’s Perrito, who seems slightly touched in the head but is such an infectious, lovable, gullible little freak, you can’t help but fall for his energy and charm. For completely opposite reasons, Mulaney’s Jack Horner is an unexpectedly, unapologetically evil dude, who makes no attempt to be likable or get any kind of redemption arc. Meanwhile, Pugh caps off a banner year with this rough-around-the-edges take on Goldilocks, who runs her adopted crime family like an outsider with something to prove. The characters’ references to their original fairy tale origins are clever, and the movie’s overall kinetic energy keeps things moving and lively. But at its center, Banderas gives Puss the necessary bravado while still making him immature enough to have some growing left to do and also finding out what it is to be humble and need others. The story is appropriately simple yet layered, and most of the jokes land just right. The animation style is familiar but still colorful, inventive, and quite silly. As far as animation geared toward younger audiences, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish feels like older crowds were taken very much into consideration when they were writing and animating this gem.

"Dec 22, 2022"," In “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” now in theaters, Puss (voiced by Antonio Baderas) goes on an epic adventure with a little help from his friends.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2022"," Narrative contrivances dwindle the suspense in this two-handed thriller exploring familiar themes of guilt, grief, regret, and fractured families. It’s set on Christmas Eve, when recovering alcoholic Darlene (Anna Gunn) is preparing to host a holiday dinner when her estranged former brother-in-law (Linus Roache) shows up unannounced. What starts as a nostalgic reunion takes a dark turn when he reveals secrets about Darlene’s missing daughter from decades earlier, prompting a desire for vengeance. While unpacking their dirty laundry, the tightly wound screenplay by rookie director Alison Locke doesn’t provide much incentive for emotional investment, although the performances bring depth to an otherwise far-fetched confrontation. (Not rated, 91 minutes). While the cartoonish action boils over, the suspense merely simmers in this far-fetched thriller that combines espionage and fine dining. It’s set during the opening night of a new upscale restaurant owned by a chef (Olga Kurylenko) who also happened to be a former Russian secret agent. When a ruthless crime syndicate targets her husband (Don Johnson) over some unpaid debts, it triggers a showdown for personal and professional survival. It’s not meant to be grounded in reality, of course, but while the over-the-top altercations and witty banter provide some mild amusement, the film relies too heavily on genre cliches rather than freshening up the recipe. (Rated R, 84 minutes). Those walls belong to the main recording space at Abbey Road Studios in London, which is the subject of this unfocused yet endearing documentary that lacks depth but efficiently salutes the legendary songs that have been recorded there for decades. Rookie director Mary McCartney has no difficulty rounding up icons to share some anecdotes, including her father, Paul, whose Beatles put Abbey Road on the map during the 1960s. Elton John, Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, and Star Wars composer John Williams provide some affectionate insight, too. The result is a collection of vintage footage and tunes with a common thread for any music buff. (Rated PG-13, 88 minutes). Despite some top-notch scenery chewing by John Malkovich as a deranged serial killer, this procedural thriller is content to rehash a familiar murder-mystery formula. Malkovich plays an eccentric psychopath known as The Artist, renowned for combining high art and religious symbolism in his brutal slayings. He’s awaiting execution in prison when an apparent copycat begins a new killing spree, leading a troubled detective (Martin Lawrence) and his upstart partner (Melissa Roxburgh) to probe his mind for clues. After a predictable parade of red herrings and investigative dead ends, a series of preposterous final-act twists drains any remaining tension and credibility, not to mention emotional investment. (Rated R, 96 minutes). As with so many secrets from World War II, a hidden diary is the launchpad for this compelling documentary about a romance that endured for decades. Nelly, a Belgian opera singer, and Nadine, the daughter of a Chinese diplomat, fell in love at a German concentration camp in 1944. After being separated by the Nazis, they both survived, reunited, and lived together for years without their closest relatives knowing the truth about their relationship. Swedish director Magnus Gertten, who had explored Nadine’s legacy in a past project, incorporates Nelly’s writings and some unearthed archival footage to unspool a powerful story of forbidden love and family memories. (Not rated, 93 minutes). With delightful irreverence, this lively and amusing sequel to the 2011 animated comedy turns our feline hero into an aging cowboy confronting his mortality. Expanding upon its fairy-tale roots, this adventure finds Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) losing his charismatic swagger when he finds that his life of daredevil swashbuckling has cost him eight of his nine lives. While on the search for a magical star to grant more lives, he reunites with ex-flame Kitty (Salma Hayek) and encounters other fairy-tale legends with ulterior motives. Although it goes overboard with the frenetic mayhem, the film strikes a balance between kid-friendly silliness and broadening its dramatic horizons. (Rated PG, 102 minutes).",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," As the swashbuckling Puss in Boots, the actor’s voice reverberates with the unrestrained enthusiasm, charm and boisterous joy lacking in his flops “Dolittle” and “Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard.” He’s animated in more ways than one. The guy treats this self-absorbed Spanish kitty who constantly speaks in the third person like it’s his Hamlet. And, you know what? It just might be. Puss, who appeared in 2004’s “Shrek 2,” is back after his stand-alone spinoff 12 years ago in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” And it’s fine! The family film doesn’t take the franchise or studio DreamWorks to new heights of invention, but it does have Oscar winner Olivia Colman voice a Cockney bear.  And so, the restless rodent-catcher hangs up his hat and moves into Mama Lana’s Cat Rescue, which is an episode of “Animal Hoarders” waiting to happen. Like David Letterman, Puss grows a beard. He also makes friends with a nameless stray dog they call Perro (Harvey Guillén), who’s pretending to be a cat to fit in. The extremely cute character throws dog lovers a bone. His twilight years are shaken up when Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo) barge in. They tell Puss about a magical wishing star that could save him — if he gets to it first. So, alongside Perro and old flame Kitty (Salma Hayek), he races against Goldi and a bulbous Lewis Carroll-esque baddie named Jack Horner (John Mulaney) to reach the enchanted object. Yes, it’s your typical Macguffin, with everybody chasing down a trinket, but a fairly creative one with a lot of good jokes. The comic-book-style action sequences also set co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s movie apart from the litter.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022","The Last Wish might not be what everyone wanted from a new Puss in Boots adventure... but it may be the one we needed in these confusing times, especially as it champions the power of the underdog.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," No exactly brilliant, Dreamworks/Universal’s computer-animated action film “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” from directors Joel Crawford (“The Croods: A New Age”) and Januel Mercado and writers Tommy Swerdlow (“The Grinch”), Tom Wheeler (“Dora and the Lost City of Gold”) and Paul Fisher (“The Croods: A New Age”) is more of the same “Shrek” spin-off character. That means Puss in Boots (voice of Antonio Banderas) and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek ), whom he supposedly left at the altar, will team up once again, this time in search of the “last wish,” a gift from the stars hidden somewhere within the “dark forest,” using a magical map that resembles a roll-up iPad. Co-opting the nursery rhyme “Star Light, Star Bright,” which most of us associate with “Pinocchio,” seems a but rude, even if Pinocchio has a cameo. But these are rude times. Opening scenes offer a song-and-dance routine. We are reminded that Puss in Boots has “never been touched by a blade” and that he is a “fearless hero.” In the course of events, most of which are fun, Puss will battle a formerly sleeping giant and lose another of his nine lives. But even with only one life left, Puss decides to seek “the last wish,” accompanied by his new friend Perrito (Harvey Guillen), a wacky chihuahua that has been passing as a cat in the cat reserve run by Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph). At the cat hostelry, Puss has been renamed “Pickles” and has grown an “old cat” beard. Once again, Puss in Boots lives in the world of fairy tales. Among his adversaries this time are Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who is armed with magical weapons, such as a crossbow that fires unicorn horns, Goldilocks (Florence Pugh, who steals scenes with her voice alone) and her “crime” family Mama Bear (Academy Award-winner Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (the great Ray Winstone) and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo, TV’s “Truth Seekers”). The bears track Puss using Baby Bear’s super sense of smell. By far, Puss’s most fearsome enemy is the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), who is nothing less than Death itself. The Big Bad Wolf dresses like the Grim Reaper of Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol” and wields sickle-shaped blades. Executive produced by Chris Meledandri of the “Despicable Me” franchise, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is never less than capable and often funny. Like “Shrek” (Puss first appeared in Shrek 2),”Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is full of pop culture references. We get a “Wizard of Oz” shout-out and, believe it or not, with its “Mountains of Misery” and similarly-named map sites, a tie to John Bunyan’s 1678 Christian allegory “Pilgrim’s Progress.” Check out the grasshopper with the voice of James Stewart, who claims to be everyone’s “conscience” (He’s Jiminy Stewart).The kiddies and their parents will miss the Stewart connection. But their grandparents won’t. Often, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” recalls an animated version of an old Bob Hope movie with Puss as a Latino swashbuckling “Ol’ Ski Nose.” Early in the action, Puss loses his trademark mini-sword, and Perrito gives Puss a stick as a less-than-worthy replacement. Puss, Kitty and Perrito practice the mystifying “big eyes” trick. Although born in Oxford, England, Pugh gives Goldilocks a working-class Cockney accent. We get a stand-off right out of “The Good, the Bad and the Ugly” and an ending out of “The Lord of the Rings.” Sail away, Puss.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022","When it comes to long-delayed sequels it’s wise to be careful what you wish for, but overall the film manages to nimbly land on its feet.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," An Oscar-worthy lead performance, an animated, finicky feline on a quest, a decadent saga about early Hollywood and a sly mystery with a cast to die for are all on your holiday cinematic menu this week. “The Whale”: Brendan Fraser’s phenomenal performance — one of the best of 2022 — elevates Darren Aronofsky’s heartfelt and emotional but sometimes overdone adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter’s brilliant stage play. Fraser taps into the beauty and warring demons of Charlie, an obese and gay online writing teacher who struggles to make amends with his angry and bitter daughter (Sadie Sink) in a critical few days that find him being visited by his enabling caregiver (Hong Chau), an alcoholic ex-wife (Samantha Morton) and a missionary (Ty Simpkins). But can anyone save the broken Charlie, who is inching closer to death? Aronofsky knows well how to convey the perils and stranglehold of addiction (“Requiem for a Dream”) and he creates a claustrophobic and suffocating environment for Charlie. Unfortunately, a rather clumsily executed use of CGI to make Charlie larger intrudes as a visual distraction in what is, in essence, a very human story about a sensitive, still-grieving person who inexorably realizes that he can’t escape from his past or his present. Details: 3½ stars out of 4; in theaters Dec. 21. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish”: Every year there’s that late surprise (think “Encanto”). DreamWorks’ hilariously entertaining sequel to the 2011 stand-alone Puss in Boots film is such a treat. The fractured fairytale comes from the fertile “Shrek” universe and brings back Antonio Banderas as the commitment-phobic feline who craves the spotlight. Puss, this time out, faces a kitty crisis when he learns that his adventure-seeking exploits have gobbled up eight of his nine lives. To get some back, he ventures into the Dark Forest to find the elusive Wishing Star. But others want to get Star as well, including the maniacal Goldie (Florence Pugh) and her Three Bears Crime Family (voices of Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo); the voracious Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and the menacing judgment-day Wolf (Wagner Moura). Directed with comedic gold by Joel Crawford and written with sass rather than snark by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, this Puss features a scene-stealing orphan canine who impersonates a cat, a character who furthers the themes that a “family” isn’t always made up of blood relations. Details: 3½ stars; in theaters Dec. 21. “Babylon”: Even when it’s at its most unwieldy and excessive, Oscar-winning director Damien Chazelle’s extravagantly wild, bold and spectacular take on how the talkies destroyed both dreams and the dreamers of the silent-film era rambunctiously entertains and enthralls. Aggressively over-the-top and ecstatic, Chazelle’s film dive-bombs into the dark, depraved side of the movie biz. And it’s reflected through various, blood-stained eyes, mostly, from three main characters: the unhinged and dirt-poor Nellie LaRoy (a sensational Margot Robbie), the can-do-anything Mexican American film assistant and romantic Manny Torres (Diego Calva, making a big splash) and the wild-boy alcoholic actor Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt). But with a movie this large and lavish (it clocks in at over 3 hours) there are numerous other larger-than-life secondary characters, including gossip columnist Elinor St. John (Jean Smart, who has one of the film’s best exchanges, with the fading star Pitt), a Black jazz trumpeter Sidney Palmer (Jovan Adepo) and a singer leading a double life Lady Fay Zhu (Li Jun Li). Jam in a wild, hard-R rated, coked-up opening party sequence a guest appearance from Tobey Maguire as a mob boss with horrific teeth, massive set pieces featuring gads of extras, a “Singin’ in the Rain” tribute and you’re in for one of the most outlandishly energetic, sinful and ambitious cinematic experiences of this year. The score by Justin Hurwitz could well land him another Oscar. Details: 3½ stars; in theaters Dec. 23. “Wildcat”: There’s a large canon of documentaries and narrative features illustrating the emotional, life-changing connection we have with animals, both domesticated and wild.  That bond gets movingly related in directors Melissa Lesh and Trevor Beck Frost’s lovely yet hard-hitting nonfiction account of how a once-suicidal Harry Turner, a British war veteran who served in Afghanistan and is in his early 20s, forms a kinship with a baby ocelot named Keanu in a Peruvian rain forest. Lesh and Beck don’t turn the camera away when the handsome, heavily tatted Turner spirals out of control and lashes out, much to the worry of Samantha Wicker, who runs the wildlife and rehabilitation center and enters into a relationship with Turner. “Wildcat” relates a poignant story about two wounded entities who become more whole once their paths cross. Details: 3 stars; in theaters Dec. 21, on Amazon Prime Video Dec. 30. “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery”: Better than the first delicious mystery, this sly bamboozler finds detective Benoit Blanc (played to the nines by a vamping Daniel Craig) again investigating murders most foul. Annoying, full-of-himself tech titan (Ed Norton) initiates the backstabbing by inviting former chums/now frenemies to his lavish digs on a Greek island. With not-so-hidden secrets, beefs between friends and skimpy swimwear galore, the suspects (Dave Bautista, Kate Hudson, Kathryn Hahn, Janelle Monae, Leslie Odom Jr. and so on) disembark into an Agatha Christie-like mousetrap where dead bodies happen. Leave it to screenwriter/director Rian Johnson to give us the perfect holiday after-dinner aperitif, a sparkler worth imbibing more than once with family and friends. Details: 3½ stars; available on Netflix Dec. 23. Related Articles

“The Holiday Sitter”: If you’re still lacking holiday spirit, the Hallmark Channel — which is airing nothing but holiday movies through the holidays — is ready to ring your jingle bells. The network’s first gay Christmas rom-com brings welcome good cheer even if you know exactly what is going to happen five minutes in. But really isn’t that why we watch these mood adjusters? The simple concept finds perpetually single career New Yorker Sam (Jonathan Bennett) summoned to care for his niece and nephew as his sister and her husband prepare to bring home a new child. Devoutly opposed to creating a family, Sam falls for Jason, the cute guy next door played fittingly by George Krissa, who agrees help Sam out. Wonder what will happen next?  Director Ali Liebert gives it all a light, bright touch and both leads are utterly charming. Details: 3 stars; available on Hallmark Channel. “High Heat”: In this awards season, where movies clock in at over three hours, there’s reason to rejoice over Zach Golden’s lean, tidy and efficient comedic spy thriller. Set mostly during a restaurant’s opening and its bullet-riddled aftermath, James Pedersen’s jewel of a screenplay presents Olga Kurylenko and Don Johnson roles that play to their strengths while allowing them to have as grand a time as we do watching them. Chef Ana (Kurylenko) along with her in-debt to the mob hubby Ray (Johnson) become targets of loan collectors along with former KGB agents from Ana’s past. What brings “High Heat” to a boil are the performances — including Kaitlin Doubleday and Chris Diamantopoulos as feuding married agents/parents — along with a quick-witted screenplay and taut direction.

"Dec 21, 2022",Puss in Boots&#58; The Last Wish is not only better than the first&#44; but it is the best film of the franchise since Shrek 2&#46;,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," The visually dazzling “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is a swashbuckling adventure with heart that has just as much substance as it does style. From the high-stakes, emotional story and beautifully directed action scenes to the terrific voice performances, this animated film is a cut above typical family-friendly entertainment. Puss in Boots (voice of Antonio Banderas) has always had a passion for daring exploits. Never one to shy away from danger, the brave kitty often finds himself in perilous situations that don’t always have a positive outcome. When Puss learns that he’s reached his eight life out of nine, he is forced to retire from his swashbuckling days and goes to live with a cat lady who rescues wayward felines. Here he meets the chatty and cheerful Perro (Harvey Guillén), a friendly Chihuahua who is only pretending to be a cat.  When Puss learns that his lost lives can be restored by the magical Wishing Star, he swallows his pride and asks his former partner (and current nemesis) Kitty Softpaws (voice of Salma Hayek) for help. With an epic quest on the horizon, Puss, Kitty and Perro venture together into the Black Forest to search for the Star. They face obstacles along the way, struggling to stay ahead of the Big Bad Wolf (voice of Wagner Moura), Big Jack Horner (voice of John Mulaney), and the nefarious Three Bears crime family (led by Goldilocks (voice of Florence Pugh)). The bright, colorful animation is lively, and co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado understand the language of action cinema. This is an exciting film with thrilling scenes of adventure, but Paul Fisher’s screenplay has a surprising amount of emotional weight. At the heart of the film is a sweet story about friendship and forgiveness, and many of the narrative elements are extremely touching. One of the most stirring is Perro’s back story, an innocent dog who lived a sad life of abandonment and cruelty. Despite his devastating past, Perro is good-natured, optimistic, and proves to be the film’s most inspiring character. The actors bring their animated counterparts to life, and the voice performances are strong. From suave (Banderas) to heartfelt (Guillén) to delightfully mischievous (Pugh), there isn’t a misstep by anyone in the cast. The idea of a fearless hero suddenly being afraid gives the film a layered richness that makes “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” more interesting than other animated films. In fact, it’s far better than expected.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022","... There's a lot of anime's irreverent humor in this road movie with dogs who think they're cats and are undergoing therapy, mouthy heroines, and villains that seem more out of a Doraemon episode than out of Shrek's world. [Full review in Spanish]",NEUTRAL
"Dec 21, 2022"," Copyright 2022 Universal/DreamworksThe swashbuckling fairy tale cat Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) likes to remind everyone of his heroic, adventurous spirit, his skill with a sword, and his gift for singing. When pressed, as he is in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” by a doctor, he will admit that he is not much at math. And this is relevant because, as we know, a cat has nine lives, and if Puss had been keeping score he would have realized that he has used up…eight of them. It does not require a lot of math skills to figure out that means he is on his last one and has to be careful.  And that is how, after an opening scene filled with swordplay, acrobatics, and valor, including the defeat of a superbly designed tree giant, Puss ends up living with a cat lady (Da’Vine Joy Randolph, warm-hearted with just a touch of dottiness). “I’m always on the lookout for a new lap cat!” she says. Puss sadly buries his feathered hat and boots and resigns himself to the indignities of blue booties, eating cat chow from a trough, and using a litter box. But then he discovers there is one chance to reboot his lives. It involves a magical map to the location of a fallen star that can grant just one wish. He is not the only one who wants that wish, though. Goldilocks (a hilarious cockney-accented Florence Pugh) and her three bear crime family (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) and Big (formerly Little) Jack Horner (John Mulaney in full sneer mode) want the wish. And so does Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), whose fearlessness and swords(wo)manship are every bit a match for PiB, with a history together that makes them both wary and attracted to one another. And so, Puss is off on a journey and in a race with the other groups trying to beat him to the wish. And as we expect from the SCU (Shrek Cinematic Universe), there will be humor ranging from sly references for the grown-ups to slapstick for the young and the young at heart. And there will be action, adventure, some heartwarming lessons about friendship and a little bit of romance. It is always fun to see or rather hear “Desperado” co-stars Hayek and Banderas together again.  The character design and movement is very well done, especially the tree giant, the wolf/bounty hunter who represents Death, and Goldilocks. And the animation style is wonderfully dynamic and expressive. I especially enjoyed the mix of animation styles. We are all used to the hyper-realism of CGI, with every hair in a cat’s fur rendered individually. So it was especially nice to see the contrast between that realism and a more impressionistic depiction of fur on the coats of the three bears or the bark on the tree giant. The combination works surprisingly well and a slight strobe effect on some of the action scenes gives them a joyfully dynamic comic-book pop.  This new chapter keeps the best of the series’ humor and heart and adds new touches to keep the story and characters vibrant. If they can keep this up, Puss should have many more lives.  Parents should know that this film has some mild schoolyard language and some almost-language, some potty humor, and extended fantasy action with some peril and violence that almost reaches the PG-13 level, including flashbacks of Puss in Boots’ first eight “deaths.” Family discussion: If you had nine lives, what chances would you take? What was different about what Golidlocks and Jack Horner wanted to wish for?",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," Han pasado diez años, pero 'Shrek' ha seguido más que viva gracias a Internet y la fábrica de memes, primero irónicos, después post-irónicos y después dadás de las diferentes generaciones. Lo cierto es que, cuando 'El gato con botas' se estrenó, allá por 2011, la saga ya estaba dando claros síntomas de decaimiento, pero después de ser adorada por las redes sociales, han decidido volver... por la puerta de atrás. Y eso no es necesariamente malo. Reconozco que no daba un duro por una nueva película de 'El gato con botas'. Creía que, puestos a volver, podían hacerlo directamente con 'Shrek 5' o con un personaje nuevo: nada podía salir bien en la secuela tardía de un spin-off que, encima, fue la película menos taquillera de la franquicia. Y, sin embargo, en 'El gato con botas: el último deseo', al no tener la responsabilidad de tener que volver a la saga principal, se han soltado el pelo con una animación divertidísima, un montón de secundarios interesantes e hilarantes y una resolución emocional a la altura. 'Spider-man: un nuevo universo' cambió el cine de animación en 3D tal y como lo conocemos, y los resultados los estamos empezando a ver ahora. De repente, todos los estudios quisieron su propia película con planos locos, diferentes estilos de animación y que se notase diferente al resto. En esta nueva película del héroe gatuno los giros de cámara imposibles, los gags de dos segundos e incluso las escenas de acción donde el personaje se mueve a menos frames por segundo aún son sorprendentes, pero no quedará mucho hasta que sean simple rutina. Pero lo mejor de 'El gato con botas: el último deseo' es que no es solo una sucesión de gags, sino que muestra una complejidad en el personaje inédita hasta ahora, tanto en lo referente a él mismo como a su relación con los que le rodean. El héroe favorito de todos está viviendo su última vida, y la gama emocional que vive es mucho más profunda e interesante de lo que podríamos imaginar: pasa del miedo a la depresión, de la indecisión al egoísmo, de la negación a la ira. En esta película, por fin, Gato con Botas se ha convertido en un personaje tridimensional. El mundo de cuentos de hadas de 'Shrek' parece que no puede dar más de sí, pero han conseguido renovarlo gracias a ocho nuevos personajes. Lo sorprendente es que todos tienen interés, trama y parecen parte orgánica de este universo. Destaca con luz propia la Muerte, un diseño maravilloso de un lobo implacable que quiere acabar de una vez por todas con nuestro héroe, y que consigue ser amenazante de manera continua: la película es lo suficientemente inteligente como para no poner ningún chiste en sus escenas y exacerbar su importancia. Estoy francamente sorprendido por el viaje emocional que la película consigue para personajes que podrían ser simples chistes andantes como Ricitos de Oro y los tres osos del crimen o Kitty y Perrito, los dos nuevos compañeros de Gato con Botas. Todos ellos tienen su propia identidad y no son simples comparsas de las aventuras del protagonista, lo que hace ganar riqueza a las tramas y a su viaje mostrando sus frustraciones, anhelos y tristezas ocultas. Todo ello, por supuesto, bien rodeados de gags para todos los gustos. Destacan especialmente el hilarante montaje con las ocho muertes anteriores de Gato con Botas y esa casa repleta de mininos a la que el protagonista se ve abocado, pero lo cierto es que, más que una comedia, se trata de una película de aventuras a la antigua usanza, con tres equipos corriendo a por un mismo objetivo, al estilo de 'Ratas a la carrera' pero con magia, cuentos y dos gatos diestros con la espada que no paran de hablar. Tristemente, he tenido que ver la película doblada al español (perdiéndonos las voces de Salma Hayek, John Mulaney y Florence Pugh), y eso incluye el inevitable cameo del famoso de turno para tener una excusa y llevar a Antonio Banderas acompañado a 'El Hormiguero'. En este caso es Rosario Flores la que hace de Mamá Luna, en un papel corto pero que se hace bola y en el que, por supuesto, canta ""Ay ay ay ay, mi gato hace uy uy uy uy"", porque para algo la has contratado. Los aficionados al cine de animación no nos merecemos a Melendi en 'Cómo entrenar a tu dragón 3', a Lola Indigo en 'Space Jam: Nuevas Leyendas' o a Rosario Flores aquí. Por favor, parad, distribuidoras. 'El hormiguero' no es tan importante. A cambio tenemos a un Antonio Banderas perfectamente metido en un papel hecho a medida y en el que se nota que se lo está pasando en grande. Consigue hacer suyo el papel, incluso después de todos estos años. Enorme. 'El gato con botas: el último deseo' excede las expectativas que se puedan poner en ella. No es una película estupenda, pero la persecución continua funciona, los secundarios son al mismo tiempo hilarantes y sensibles, todos los personajes tienen diferentes dimensiones y logra tener un carisma propio que parecía casi imposible de conseguir una década después. Y una vez lanzado el globo sonda, veremos si esto significa el esperadísimo retorno del ogro verde o se mantendrá en el éter unos cuantos años más.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," It's something of a mystery as to how ""Shrek"" has managed to endure for so long after its release. Although the original film and its first sequel are arguably the most beloved films in the Dreamworks back catalog, they're both clear products of their era, stuffed with pop culture gags younger audiences would now have to Google to understand, be they references to old TV game shows (which were inexplicably carried over to the later stage musical adaptation), or jokes about celebrity culture of the early 2000's. ""Shrek 2"" included a gag about Cameron Diaz dating Justin Timberlake that was already dated by the release of ""Shrek the Third,"" in which Timberlake starred, three years later — and yet, that 2004 sequel was a big hit with streamers on Netflix in 2022 and is still beloved by millions even as it becomes more of a relic, one joke at a time. Is the enduring appeal of the franchise entirely due to millennial nostalgia and years worth of memes, or are younger generations equally invested in the fairytale-skewering franchise? That question is going to be firmly answered with ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,"" a sequel to the 2011 spin-off centered on Antonio Banderas' feisty feline which also doubles up as the first entry in this ""Shrek"" cinematic universe to reach the big screen in more than a decade. Although this story isn't a reboot, featuring many familiar comforts from the original ""Shrek"" saga, it is still has to shoulder the burden of being a soft relaunch of the series, keenly aware that today's younger viewers won't have even been born the last time any of these characters were last on the big screen. The stale pop culture references are out, the CGI animation has been given a post-""Spider-Verse"" comic-book style renovation, and the story exists as a standalone adventure that keeps its ties to the swamp and the kingdom of Far Far Away as minimal as possible. The result is far more enjoyable than the previous solo ""Puss in Boots"" outing — and yet despite the superficial visual pleasures and a healthy dose of solid gags, there's very little within the film that justifies why the franchise needed to be resurrected to tell this story in the first place. It mercifully doesn't coast on millennial nostalgia in the way I feared it would, but there's equally little within this run-of-the-mill adventure that answers why the next generation should start caring about this character too. Picking up after the events of the first film — although not in too much depth to prove overwhelming for newcomers — Puss in Boots (Banderas) is hailed as a hero, albeit one whose death defying experiences are about to come to an end, after getting told he's burnt through eight lives and onto his last. He reluctantly agrees to start a new life as a house cat, but that's cut short when Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) show up looking for him, hoping to claim a reward for his capture. It's through this encounter that Puss learns of the Wishing Star, that he aims to find in the hope of restoring his eight previous lives. Unfortunately for him, the map to its location is being held by Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who much like Goldi and the three bears, has more nefarious intentions with his wishes. As a cursory glance of that plot summary can attest, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" may appear distinctive within the franchise due to its visual style, but it remains the same when it comes to its light hearted subversion of fairytale lore. While there is comic inspiration to how little Jack Horner has been reinvented as a sinister villain, tired of people looking down on him his entire life, the strange reinterpretation of ""Goldilocks and the Three Bears"" is a clearer sign of a franchise running low on ideas, with very few familiar stories left to parody. The idea of Goldilocks teaming up with the bears to become a crime family after getting rumbled by them has some mileage, but screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow instead go back to the drawing board with the original fairytale, having to rewrite it as they can't get the joke to work within its parameters. The ""Shrek"" films successfully managed to satirize beloved tales without needing to drastically alter the original text to land the punchline, which is far from the case here. 
There are still plenty of amusing gags peppered throughout the screenplay, from the opening montage of Puss in Boots losing each of his previous lives to his awkward relationship with therapy dog Perrito (voiced by ""What We Do in the Shadows"" star Harvey Guillén). At times, it is noticeably lazier than the original ""Shrek"" films in its joke writing; by the time Salma Hayek's Kitty Softpaws is re-introduced, it falls back to the same flaw as the previous ""Puss in Boots"" outing, having the feline couple reference name check various aspects of Latin American culture but without making them into anything approaching a joke. By the time Kitty makes an irrelevant reference to her quinceañera during an action sequence, it's easy to think that the filmmakers believe simply name-checking anything that sounds Spanish can work as a joke in and of itself.





Only in the visual style, that now-familiar story book design pioneered by ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" does the film feel consistently refreshing, even as this animation style threatens to become derivative by overuse (this is the second Dreamworks film in 2022 to bear the ""Spider-Verse"" influence, following ""The Bad Guys""). Bob Persichetti, one of the three credited directors of ""Spider-Verse,"" was originally announced as the project's director, but even in his departure his visual influence is laid bare over every frame of the film. And while the action sequences aren't as ingeniously designed as in that Academy Award-winning effort, they are still the most breathtaking within the entire ""Shrek"" franchise, offering further proof that CG animation is at its most effective when it abandons any aspirations towards photorealism.





There might be enough to entertain children within ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,"" but it's unlikely this will make them fall in love with the character in the same way ""Shrek 2"" did effortlessly nearly two decades ago. As for millennial fans looking for a dose of nostalgia? Well, the first two ""Shrek"" movies are still available to stream.

"Dec 21, 2022"," Down to the last of his nine lives thanks to his devil-may-care, adventuring lifestyle, the legendary tabby knows fear for the first time. Indeed, it seems to him that death itself stalks his every move. But just as he’s resigned himself to the life of a housecat, he learns of a wishing star and decides that this one wish is his key to becoming his fearless, legendary self again. Too bad his ex, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), is also after it. So is narcissistic psychopath and piemaker Jack Horner (John Mulaney), as well as Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo). That’s a killer cast right there. That’s five Academy Award nominations and one Oscar. Sure, most of that is Colman, but still, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is loaded with talent. That’s no real surprise from the Shrek franchise or the gang at Dreamworks. What is a surprise is the material these pros have to tear into. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado capitalize on the talent with a heartfelt, surprisingly mature script from Tommy Swerdlow, Tom Wheeler and Paul Fisher as well as animation that looks better than anything the studio’s put out to date. Banderas has a blast, as he has since his first appearance as the booted feline in 2004. Not every actor is cut out for voice work, but Banderas excels. Pugh’s scrappy Goldilocks is a stitch, as is Winstone’s Papa Bear. Colman characteristically delivers a performance that’s equal parts tender, hilarious and heartbreaking. And with just her voice! The entire cast, including Harvey Guillén as the most resilient chihuahua ever animated, populates this imaginary world with decidedly memorable characters – characters with dimension, 2D be damned. Puss’s existential crisis drives this imaginative, often hilarious adventure, but it does more than that. It anchors all the derring-do with earnest emotion and recognizable struggle. The film never feels as if it’s winking at its adult audience while dishing out frivolity to youngsters. Instead, somehow the filmmakers bridge that, engaging all ages with an emotionally complex but digestible tale, gorgeously rendered, beautifully acted and shockingly fun.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," Even animated cats have nine lives. Unfortunately for Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), he’s already blown through eight of his. The narcissistic furball outlaw from the “Shrek” series is back, and his fame has only grown since we last saw him in 2011′s “Puss in Boots.” As “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” opens, Puss is making a celebrity appearance in Del Mar at the home of the rich governor he’s just robbed. After dumping stolen gold coins on the ecstatic villagers, he launches into one of several catchy ditties by composer Heitor Pereira. “Who is your favorite fearless hero?” sings Puss about himself while fending off the governor’s henchmen and the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar, an enormous treelike creature awakened by all that noise. “Puss in Boots has never been touched by a blade!” he brags mid-battle. But Puss has been touched by the Grim Reaper seven times. A hilarious montage shows his demises, which include getting hit by a bull in Pamplona, cheating at poker with dogs, succumbing to a shellfish allergy, and drunkenly proving that cats do not always land on their feet. His eighth death, as the village doctor (Anthony Mendez) informs him, occurred when a large bell crushed him after he defeated the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar. “You need to retire,” the doctor says, offering him a card for Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a crazy cat lady who runs a “retirement home” for cats. “I’m nobody’s lap cat,” Puss protests. “Remember,” the doctor warns, “Death comes for us all.” And boy, does Death come to slay! The animators have designed the coolest-looking reaper since “The Seventh Seal.” Appropriate for this fairy tale world, Death is an enormous, hooded, and red-eyed version of the Big Bad Wolf. Not only is he big and bad, he carries two gigantic sickles and speaks in the ominous voice of Wagner Moura. When one of those sickles touches our feline hero and draws blood, he runs into the waiting arms of Mama Luna. She names him Pickles and forces him to regress to full catlike behavior — using the litter box instead of the toilet, for instance, and eating a cartoon version of kitty kibble. Oh, the humiliation! Before Puss settles into his new lifestyle, he’s accosted by fellow outlaws Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Their vocal talent is just right: Goldie (Florence Pugh), Baby Bear (Samson Kayo), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman), and Papa Bear (Ray Winstone) make up a Cockney criminal crew. They’re looking for a map that will lead them to a wishing star, a map currently owned by Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Anyone who finds the fallen star can make one wish. Puss sees his chance to earn nine more lives, so he sets off to find it. The game is aboot — I mean, afoot! “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” also features minor characters from earlier films, including my favorite cameo: the cat who covers his mouth and goes “OOOOOOH!!” Salma Hayek is back as love interest/better thieving half Kitty Softpaws. And as the newest toy your toddlers will want, Harvey Guillén plays Perro, an optimistic, foul-mouthed Chihuahua who dresses like a cat and wants to be a therapy dog. The script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow is very silly, to be sure, but everything works. The animation is well done, the music has a lovely Spanish flair, and the cast does an excellent job bringing the characters to life. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado adopt a fun, Looney Tunes-style vibe, which I enjoyed so much that, when threatened with yet another sequel at the end, I was too entertained to protest.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2022"," Maybe
this series needed a long break, because Puss
in Boots: The Last Wish feels like being reacquainted with an old friend.
There was a time, more than two decades ago, when Shrek felt almost revolutionary in the way it played with fairy
tales and mocked their conventions and practices, as well as digging into those
of the biggest animation studio at the time (now a media conglomerate so large
that any kind of satirical barb would feel akin throwing a pebble into the
ocean, for all the waves it would make). Among
its other inspirations, the sequel introduced us to Puss in Boots, the
swashbuckling cat voiced with aplomb by Antonio Banderas. As for the additional
sequels and the first attempt to give the sword-wielding feline his own series,
they definitely could have been worse, even if they never came close to reaching
the heights of the first two films. Here,
though, we're 11 years beyond Puss in
Boots and the apparent end of this franchise (There apparently was a
television show revolving around the character in between, but who, really, has
the time?). It's more than a bit of a surprise to state that this belated and
unexpected sequel reminds us of the best narrative and comedic elements of its
earliest predecessors. The passage of time is also a great benefit to the
filmmakers, who tackle that fact head on in a story that allows a more mature
approach to the material and a level of growth for the title character. We're
re-introduced to Puss in the middle of a grand celebration of, well, himself. A
big song-and-dance number reminds us of his self-indulgent bombast, and with the
return of the owner of the mansion where the party is being held, we're reminded
that the cat is also a bit of a con artist at heart. Anyway, all of that leads
to a chase and a battle with an awakened giant that had been sleeping outside
the village, and after much derring-do, Puss is victorious. Until a giant bell
falls on top of him, that is. None of
this would be a problem, because, like all cats, Puss has nine lives. Our hero
hasn't been keeping count of his deaths, though, so after going through all of
his previous lives (A favorite ending has Puss continuing to eat shrimp because
it's so tastyand despite an allergy to shellfish), Puss is stunned to realize
that, including the most recent incident, he has died eight times. This is his
last life. What is a reckless adventurer to be and do if he can no longer be
reckless with the sole life he has? That's
a pretty substantial question to serve as the foundation for a film such as
this, which features plenty of anthropomorphic animals and allusions to classic
fairy tales and a generally lighthearted tone. One of the real thrills of Paul
Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow's screenplay, though, is that the pair follow through
on that notion beyond Puss' existential crisis. The character isn't simply
trying to figure out what to do with his life now. He has to determine what to
do about the fact that he knows for certain he will die. Death
isn't just a concept here. It's a character in the form of the Big Bad Wolf
(voice of Wagner Moura), whom Puss assumes is a bounty hunter when the beast
approaches him, seemingly from out of nowhere, at a local tavern. The wolf is
one, technically, and with every thought of adventure or risk, Puss finds
himself being watched or followed by the wolf. Eventually, the cat decides to
bury his hat and cape, opting for a risk-free life at a cat shelter in the
middle of nowhere. The
rest of the plot is downright simple, in that it has Puss learning about and
seeking out a wishing star in the middle of a forest (hoping to wish for his
nine lives again), and fairly complicated, in that it brings a slew of
additional characters into the mix and somehow finds a way to gradually
transform them into more than jokes. Kitty Softpaws (voice of Salma Hayek
Pinault), a master thief and Puss' former romantic interest, returns, also
looking for the star and rightfully bitter about the last encounterwell,
non-encounterbetween Puss and her. A new ally is Perro (voice of Harvey Guillén),
an adorably anxious and eager little mutt who's desperate to make friends. He'd
be pathetic if the dog weren't so sincere, his back story so depressing, and his
inability to realize how bad he has had it so tragic and admirable. Other
characters, like the Big Bad Wolf and its transformation into a specter of death
incarnate, are more familiar in the realm of fairy tales and given unique twists
here. Puss learns of the star, as well as a map leading to it, from Goldlilocks
(voice of Florence Pugh) and her adoptive family of three bearswith Ray
Winstone providing the voice of Papa, Olivia Colman voicing Mama, and Samson
Kayo serving as the voice of Baby. They're a team of criminals (a ""crime
family,"" Mama Bear insists on calling them or at least hopes to be the
case), and while the quartet initially comes across as a gag, it becomes quite
affecting how this family is a real one, even as Goldilocks yearns for what she
believes to be a ""real"" one. The
villain is Big Jack Horner (voice of John Mulaney), who runs a pie factory and
is envious of only being the subject of a nursery rhyme. He's the worst of bad
customers , in search of absolute magical power, and an inspired gag has a
conscientious cricket adamantly believing there must be something good about
this dastardly antagonist. There isn't, by the way, and the dark humor of that
is as unanticipated and refreshing as the film's deeper themes. Under
the guidance of director Joel Crawford, the film looks great, using a kind of
storybook style for the action sequences (motions lines and a sense of the
characters moving in a slightly jittery way, as if by the turning of pages).
Beyond that, Puss in the Boots: The Last Wish gives us rich characters and a
smart narrative, featuring some considered ideas about mortality and living.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2022"," Quick, without looking, guess how long it’s been since there’s been a Shrek movie or even a Shrek-adjacent one. Over a decade seems too long for such a popular franchise, right? And yet here we are, 11 years later, welcoming back Antonio Banderas’s swashbuckling feline in “ Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” which opens in theaters Wednesday.  No wonder he’s forced to think about his own mortality in this one — certain segments of the audience will be too when they realize how much time has passed. It wasn’t for lack of trying, but things were happening behind the scenes with various directors coming and going. then Universal acquired DreamWorks and they went back to the drawing board under new leadership. Somehow television spinoffs kept coming. The good news is that the character is evergreen. And as soon as Banderas starts speaking, and singing, as his playfully egotistic character, it’ll feel like hardly any time has gone by at all. In “The Last Wish,” the ever-confident Puss in Boots is shaken to discover that he’s used up eight of his nine lives and, for the first time, has started worrying about his own death. It might seem a little dour for a children’s animated comedy, but when you start to think about other kids’ movies, it’s actually a quite common theme. Are they the anxieties of the middle-aged creators creeping out or an empathy machine for kids to think about the adults in their lives? Both? Does it matter? It’s a device to rattle our hero, who has a bounty on his head and a big, bad wolf (Wagner Moura) on his tail. First he tries out retirement life in a home with Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), in which he’s forced to behave like a cat — using a litter box (“so this is where dignity goes to die,” he says) and eating cat food as opposed to his stovetop cooking as a cover of The Doors’ “The End” plays in the background. But he gets a lifeline in the legend of a single wish in a star that’s fallen to earth and is waiting to be granted, sending him, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and a gratingly earnest dog (Harvey Guillén) on an adventure to get said wish. This is where the movie really finds its groove, with the introduction of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) who is a kind of crime lord to her family of bears, Mama (Olivia Colman), Papa (Ray Winstone) and Baby (Samson Kayo), and, separately, a no longer little Little Jack Horner (John Mulaney) who are all after the wishing star too. The vocal cast is an embarrassment of riches, especially Pugh, Colman, Winstone, who are right out of a PG-rated Guy Ritchie movie and should get their own spinoff. Mulaney, too, is a perfect adult brat, bitter about his origin being just a nursery rhyme and not a full fairy tale. He’s another kind of crime brute, collecting and stealing famous fairy tale items to compensate for his own lack of magical powers and uses them to fun ends. Directed by Joel Crawford, with Januel Mercardo as co-director, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” has enough good jokes (script by Paul Fisher and story by Tommy Swerdlow and Tom Wheeler) to keep anyone amused for an afternoon at the movies. The animation is exactly what you need it to be too and avoids too much of the frenetic anarchy of a lot of kids movies that mistake chaos for excitement. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” a Universal Pictures release in theaters Wednesday, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for “rude humor, language, action/violence and some scary moments.” Running time: 102 minutes. Three stars out of four.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2022"," Si a lo largo de su trayectoria el binomio Disney/Pixar se ha topado alguna vez con una alternativa, posiblemente sea DreamWorks el estudio de animación  en el que pensar. Cerca de cumplir 30 años, la compañía fundada por Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg y David Geffen no siempre ha acertado (de hecho ha cedido en numerosas ocasiones a las franquicias derivativas y las modas), pero sí ha hecho gala de una encomiable intuición para lanzar personajes a la cultura popular. La animación USA, sin embargo y por suerte, ha tenido el suficiente desarrollo en la última década como para que el binomio principal se tambalee ligeramente y ocurra lo mismo con el eterno segundón, a través fundamentalmente de dos fenómenos. Uno es todo lo que ha traído Illumination Entertainment, con Gru y los Minions fraguando taquillazos descomunales. Otro es el terremoto estético de Spider-Man: Un nuevo universo. El gato con botas: El último deseo, lo último de DreamWorks, viene condicionado por ambos fenómenos. Chris Meledandri, líder de Illumination, es uno de los productores tras la secuela de El gato con botas, queriendo revitalizar una marca tan agotada como Shrek del mismo modo en que intentará hacerlo, próximamente, con Kung Fu Panda. Contra lo que pueda parecer, esta nueva vitalidad no se ha traducido tanto en una «minionización» de El gato con botas como en una suerte de vaciado de los rasgos que habían llevado la saga previamente al colapso, caso de las referencias pop de escaso recorrido o el talante meta (rasgos, por otra parte, que instauró el primer Shrek abocando a un fatídico primer lustro de los 2000 para la animación mainstream). El último deseo es, pues, una película ligera y de desarrollo espídico, diseñada para que la maravilla ante la imagen en movimiento nunca se matice por un chiste fallido o una referencia sobreelaborada. Lo que nos lleva al segundo condicionamiento, el del Spiderverso: El último deseo ha tomado como influencia su estilo de animación, ese que puede ser denominado NPR shading o cel shading hipervitaminado, y que tantas y tan vertiginosas posibilidades está demostrando tener. DreamWorks ya había experimentado previamente con esta técnica en Los tipos buenos (Capitán Calzoncillos, en 2017, también podría considerarse un precedente por el choque caótico de escuelas), y El último deseo se abandona a ella con un ímpetu, en ocasiones, problemático. El equipo comandado por Joel Crawford y Januel Mercado está tan fascinado por sus posibilidades que el dispositivo visual puede antojarse arbitrario: la toonización de los diseños encaja por el parentesco con las ilustraciones de los cuentos de hadas (y es particularmente acertada en el caso de la fabulosa relectura de Ricitos de Oro y los tres osos), pero no así la disminución de los frames durante las escenas de acción. Spider-Man utilizaba este ralentizado para simular el paso de páginas de un cómic y de paso molarlo todo, pero El último deseo solo lo hace para lo segundo, generando un distanciamiento curiosamente concomitante al uso selectivo de los 48 fotogramas por segundo en Avatar: El sentido del agua, blockbuster con el que competirá estas Navidades. Es un defecto intrínseco al entusiasmo por el que se deja llevar El último deseo, y por tanto un defecto perdonable. La secuela de El gato con botas se distancia tanto de su olvidable película previa como de la misma Shrek al llevarnos a un mundo que parece nuevo a cada plano, cada idea visual, cada pensamiento juguetón que enriquece la narración. Su previsible enseñanza sobre el valor de los deseos logra, así, recabar frescura a golpe de convicción, con un agradecido aire crepuscular a lo Logan fundiéndose con un desarrollo sorprendentemente coral. El último deseo está repleta de personajes carismáticos, del felino de Antonio Banderas al adorable perro que se convierte en su mascota, algo que también cimenta su triunfo categórico en lo que se refiere a impedir que apartes la vista en algún instante de lo que sucede en pantalla. El gato con botas: El último deseo es una obra hipnótica, seductora, divertidísima y bellísima. Y quizá, si nos tomamos a lo literal el nuevo (y bastante feo) opening de DreamWorks que la introduce, sea el inicio de una nueva era para un estudio que casi nunca había brillado tanto como brilla aquí. El gato con botas descubre que ha consumido ocho de sus nueve vidas, con lo que se ve en la obligación de abandonar sus aventuras y acometer la jubilación. No obstante, según se entera de la existencia de una estrella que concede deseos, se lo piensa mejor.  Queda prohibida toda reproducción sin permiso escrito de la empresa a los efectos del artículo 32.1, párrafo segundo, de la Ley de Propiedad Intelectual.

"Dec 20, 2022"," It’s been 11 years since Puss in Boots buckled his last swash on the big screen, and the fearless feline’s latest sequel demonstrates one of the most valuable tools in any hero’s repertoire: knowing when to make an appearance. Or in this case, a very belated reappearance. DreamWorks Animations’ “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” surpasses its predecessor in both scope of execution and depth of emotion. With Antonio Banderas back voicing the role, an engrossing story coupled with a vivid new animation style makes this a delight in every way — an enchanting excursion that will captivate the kids and rope in the grown-ups alongside them. Directed by Joel Crawford (“The Croods: A New Age”), this film finds the self-possessed Puss happily living it up, vanquishing villains while taking in the applause of the townsfolk. But “living it up” suddenly becomes problematic when an unfortunate encounter with a giant bell leaves Puss with the realization that years of adventuring have whittled his trademark nine lives down to one. With a scythe-wielding dog in black (voiced by Wagner Moura) — a bounty hunter, or perhaps something more Grim? — nipping at his heels, Puss divests himself of his heroic accoutrements and is resigned to a life of mittens and scratching posts with cat lady Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), where he meets a scruffy, friendless pooch he names Perrito (Harvey Guillén). A life of quiet desperation beckons for Puss (growing a desperately unkempt beard in the process) until he becomes aware of a lost Wishing Star that will grant the desire of anyone who finds it. Nine more lives, here he comes! Of course, it’s not just Puss (and perpetually sunny Perrito) on the hunt for a magical map to find the way. His former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek, returning from the first film) hopes to gain the wish for herself, and isn’t exactly thrilled to see Puss again after a bad breakup. Also in the mix are Goldilocks and the Three Bears (Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), reimagined as a roving criminal band with the grown-up Goldi at the fore. Manipulating things behind the scenes is the sinister “Big” Jack Horner. Voiced by John Mulaney, the little boy from the fairy tale has a new name and attitude after several years of eating those pies. All three groups wander across a constantly shifting storybook landscape as they eye the prize. While the earlier films (going back to the first “Shrek” in 2001) had a rubbery CGI style that typified the form in the early aughts, it hasn’t aged particularly well. New director Crawford borrows a page from 2018’s Oscar-winning “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” and DreamWorks’ own “The Bad Guys” from earlier this year to give a stylized, dynamic approach to “The Last Wish” that imbues the proceedings with a whole new energy. There are several digressions — occasionally uplifting and oftentimes uproarious — as each group attempts to claim the Wishing Star, all with very different plans if they get it. Goldilocks, for example, wants everything to be just right, which might be positively endearing were it not for the fact that she sounds like a cockney gangster out of a Guy Ritchie movie. Of course, the most important part of the mix is the man whose dulcet tones carry us along on this fractured fairy tale. Banderas is in fine form as his animated alter ego, clearly having lost none of his affinity for the role in the intervening decade and change. Quick, someone convince Banderas to reprise his other iconic sword-slashing hero as well! How things culminate in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” isn’t exactly surprising. But in true storybook fashion, the script by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow offers enough swerves to make the journey worthy of the destination. It’s a perfect package of whimsy, sass and sweetness. Based on where this one ends, the filmmakers are no doubt already at work puzzling out Puss’ next cinematic offering, and here’s hoping it’s not another 11 years before we see it.

"Dec 20, 2022"," Shrek changed everything — but not necessarily for the better. The animation industry was already on the cusp of metamorphosis. Disney was in the throes of an identity crisis following the end of its ‘90s Renaissance. Pixar’s Toy Story broke new ground for the CG animated movie. But where Toy Story proved the power of CG animation, Shrek mined its potential to deliver a sharp fairytale satire that spoke in the post-ironic language early aughts audiences absolutely ate up.  It only took a smug arched eyebrow and a glib, self-deprecating tone for earnest cinema to begin its slow and painful death. With each subsequent Shrek movie — of which there are four (!) including the first Puss in Boots — the series lost its luster, becoming just another clever, self-aware franchise in a sea of clever, self-aware animated movies that spent more money on their disinterested stars than their shabby animation made by underpaid CG artists. It seemed like the fate of Shrek was to be doomed to the dustbin of history, the original movie eclipsed by memes and ironic Shrek raves. That is, until Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The sequel to 2011’s Puss in Boots, which saw Antonio Banderas reprise the role of the feline swordmaster in a one-off adventure, The Last Wish isn’t the revolution some reviews might suggest. But by taking visual and emotional inspiration (along with a director) from the revolutionary Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, it’s the radical breath of fresh air that the waning Shrek franchise has long needed. And with it following in the footsteps of eye-popping CG animated films like The Mitchells vs. The Machines and The Bad Guys, The Last Wish could even do as the original Shrek did: signal an exciting turning point for the stale state of animation. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes place sometime after the events of the first Puss in Boots and Shrek Forever After. Puss is enjoying his fame as a legendary hero, but time catches up with even the most dashing of rogues, as his latest daring adventure leaves Puss on the last of his nine lives. Forced to grapple with his own mortality for the first time, Puss is sent on the run by a bloodthirsty bounty hunter, Wolf (a terrifying Wagner Moura), who stalks him at every turn. But retirement does not suit Puss, and when he hears of a Wishing Star that can grant the user one wish, he embarks on a quest to get his nine lives back. The Last Wish is a surprisingly introspective family adventure, one that gives as much airtime to questions of mortality, ego, and legacy as it does “edgy” riffs on fairytales. It’s embodied in Banderas’ disarmingly tender performance as Puss, the actor tapping into the same naked vulnerability he displayed in Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain and Glory — another movie about an over-the-hill man looking back at his life and legacy. To speak of these two movies in the same sentence is ridiculous, to be sure, but it’s incredible that Banderas gives as much grace to a talking cat character satirizing his own role of Zorro as he does to his career-best performance. It speaks to how much care he has for the character — and it comes through in the film itself. The Shrek franchise’s penchant for stunt casting is on full display here, but the supporting stars all step up to lend the same amount of emotional care. Salma Hayek returns as Puss’ femme fatale love interest Kitty Softpaws, now wounded from their failed romantic past. Harvey Guillén just avoids being the annoying sidekick as the eternally optimistic dog Perrito, who tags along on Puss’ quest. And this movie’s main fairytale twist — Goldilocks and the Three Bears, but as scrappy Guy Ritchie-esque gangsters — have surprising depth thanks to the ever-talented Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, and Ray Winstone. The only one who feels out of place is John Mulaney’s villainous ""Big"" Jack Horner — Mulaney’s trademark bubbly voice reaching the limits of his range. But the better-than-expected vocal performances of the celebrity voice cast wouldn’t work quite as well if The Last Wish weren’t so stunningly animated. Borrowing from Into the Spider-Verse’s comics-inspired CG animation, The Last Wish takes on a painterly look unlike any Shrek movie before it. For what reason? None, other than it looks cool, but it’s the kind of dynamic, visually exciting stylistic choice that is of a piece with Puss in Boots’ bombastic personality. Little stylistic flairs — lines that appear in the air when a person claps, action that moves faster than you can blink, lush greens transforming into bright pinks in a split second, the threat of death casting the world into deep shadows and flaming reds — make The Last Wish feel all the more fantastical. Special care has been given to the character designs too; the bounty-hunting Wolf, wielding scythes and appearing like a vision of Death each time, is especially striking. Kung Fu Panda director Joel Crawford shepherds this new visual approach with zeal, taking over from Into the Spider-Verse head of story Bob Persichetti, who was originally brought on as director before stepping down. It’s worth remembering how radical Shrek was when it debuted. It was a middle finger to the Disney fairytale, a fart in the face to the dominating force in family entertainment. It cleverly sent up the antiquated formula of the Disney animated movie and managed to squeeze in a Matrix parody while it was at it. It was animation for adults. Of course, Hollywood — and the Shrek franchise itself — took all the wrong lessons from Shrek. Cleverness was prioritized over character. Quips over sincere emotion. Parodies over story progress. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish may not be quite the shock to the system that Shrek was, but it’s a much-needed injection of that special magic that’s been missing since the first film: emotional depth, visual dynamism, and most importantly, something new.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2022"," Once you get over the realization that this sequel to the 2011 spin-off from the “Shreck” series is about mortality, you, and your kids, should have a fine time at “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” a darker but surprisingly engaging take on the character’s quest to remake himself under threat of impending demise, powered by a typically high-octane, self-mocking turn by Antonio Banderas and splendid DreamWorks animation.  It also plugs nicely into the fractured fairy-tale approach of the franchise. The picture starts flamboyantly with a sequence in which Puss (voiced by Banderas), the egomaniacal swashbuckling cat, takes over a corrupt governor’s estate for a people’s fiesta and then defeats a gigantic monster.  Unfortunately, while taking his bows he’s clobbered by a huge bell and dies. That doesn’t bother Puss overmuch, as he’s died before, and like all felines having nine lives he’s come back to life.  But in discussion with the local doctor (Anthony Mendez), he’s persuaded in a hilarious montage that he’s used up eight of them, and advised to give up his reckless ways and settle down.  Still he’s unconvinced until an encounter with menacing Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), a sinister blade-slinger who identifies himself as Death, sends him scurrying away in fear.  Puss has become a scaredy-cat.  Burying his distinctive outfit—including those famous boots—he takes refuge with loopy cat lady Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), among whose brood he finds a disguised mutt later named Perrito (Harvey Guillén), an incessantly upbeat pooch who wants to be a therapy dog and becomes his unwanted pal.  Puss feels humiliated and despondent over his change of fortune, but his hopes rise when he learns that a Wishing Star has landed in the Dark Forest; it will grant its finder his fondest dream—in his case, of course, the restoration of his lives. So he retrieves his duds and sets off, but not alone.  Perrito tags along unasked, and soon they’re joined by Puss’s erstwhile fiancée Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), a butt-kicking type whom he left waiting at the altar years before.  Both he and she are after the map to the Wishing Star, which puts them into competition with the slapstick gang of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears, Mama (Olivia Colman), Papa (Ray Winstone) and Baby (Samson Kayo) on the one hand, and the evil “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) on the other.  All want to be first at the Star, and to snatch the wish that goes along with it.  As you might expect, the complications of the chase are many—there are kidnappings, rescues, and confrontations galore, most smartly paced (by director Joel Crawford and editor James Ryan) and wittily written (by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow). Along the way, of course, Puss must learn to conquer his fears and overcome his selfishness, and there are lessons coming to his companions and competitors as well.  Other characters also make appearances, with an especially amusing one by a cricket who, in the voice of Kevin McCann, sounds an awful lot like Jimmy Stewart; he’s Horner’s conscience, but proves even less successful than Jiminy in that department.  (Pinocchio also shows up, briefly.)  The animation is vivid, with a colorful production design by Nate Wragg, and Heitor Pereira’s score aligns genially with the visuals. Banderas anchors the movie, sending up his own image as both lothario and Zorro with zest while capturing Puss’s emotional doldrums with equal aplomb.  Everyone else enters into the spirit of things as well, making the most of dialogue with a lot more hits than misses.  Be forewarned, though, that some of the scenes with the Wolf might be a mite scary for the youngest viewers, and that the inspiration behind some of the carefully staged fight sequences will escape them; there are references to other movies here that assume you’ll recognize them.  If you do, you’ll smile more broadly.  If not, no matter.

"Dec 20, 2022"," The Shrek franchise has always been one of diminishing returns, never again reaching the all-star heights of the original, which itself is of dubious overall quality. This was nowhere more apparent than in the spin-off film Puss In Boots, an exceedingly ugly and unfunny romp that is best left as a forgotten footnote of Dreamworks’ animated output. However, Dreamworks Animation is apparently having a really good year, first with the surprisingly fun heist antics of The Bad Guys, and now with the Puss In Boots sequel, The Last Wish (in theaters everywhere December 21), which is so visually striking and narratively engaging that it feels unfair that it took the Shrek franchise six films to get here. Reveling in his legendary status as an invincible hero, Puss (Antonio Banderas) comes to the traumatic realization that he has burned through eight of his nine lives, exposing him to the possibility that he may need to confront a permanent death. After an encounter with a threatening and ominous bounty-hunting wolf (Wagner Moura) leaves Puss shaken, he retreats into bearded, depressive reclusion, where he attracts the unwanted friendship of a nameless therapy support dog (Harvey Guillén). However, this seclusion does not prevent the Three Bears crime family (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo), led by Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), from tracking Puss down, with the hopes of recruiting him for a job to hunt down the map to a lost wishing star. Puss, of course, sees this as an opportunity to wish his lost lives back into existence, so the race is on to get to the star before Goldilocks and the bears. Along the way, he reunites with his love interest from the previous film, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek, whose perpetual chemistry with Banderas was the only good thing about the previous film), and runs afoul of the magically gluttonous Jack Horner (John Mulaney), both of whom have their own agendas in finding the star. This makes for an admittedly busy narrative in terms of characters and motivations, but The Last Wish is able to keep up with all its players with exceptional pacing, both in terms of story and action. The most obvious upgrade from the previous film is in the animation, which takes inspiration from a number of sources but is most obviously reminiscent of the innovations pioneered in Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse. The combination of 2D and 3D animation meshes well with the painterly storybook aesthetic that The Last Wish is aiming for, allowing one to soak in beautiful vistas in the quiet moments and seamlessly ramping up into frenetic action that draws influence from shonen anime, of all places. Especially for being the product of a franchise known for its reflexive cynicism, The Last Wish is an especially vibrant and kinetic spectacle that’s having unironic fun with its grab bag of fairy tale pastiches, without limiting itself to a retread of familiar characters and themes. This is in no small part because The Last Wish has a lot on its mind with regard to its characters, especially Puss himself. This is ultimately a story about accepting one’s mortality, perhaps an appropriate mid-life crisis narrative for those who saw the original Shrek as teenagers, but no less effective as an internal struggle that the whole family can understand and enjoy. As Puss comes to realize his legendary status is not a substitute for interpersonal connection, his interactions with Kitty and the therapy dog start to take on a surprising amount of weight, while Goldilocks serves as a well-realized foil who has more in common with Puss that is at first apparent. None of these character beats slow the film down or distract from the spectacle, but rather enhance the film into a true example of all-ages entertainment that doesn’t condescend to its audience. Unfortunately, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is not without its stumbles. As fun as Jack Horner and his Baker’s Dozen mercenaries can be in the action sequences—a cadre of Mad Max: Fury Road War Boys by way of Kitchen Nightmares—Jack himself is a relatively shallow villain who doesn’t add much to the overall themes or plot. Goldilocks and the three bears are more compelling, but their dialogue continually looping back around to the phrase “just right” is a motif that gets old fast and could have been used more sparingly. And while it’s seemingly obligatory in this age of perpetual franchising, the occasional callbacks to Shrek characters are distracting in a film that otherwise stands very well on its own. Overall, though, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is one of cinema’s biggest surprises of the year. Dreamworks Animation really seems to be pulling out the stops these days with distinctive visuals and well-written stories, making The Last Wish easily the best film in the Shrek franchise. This is hopefully a good sign for the future of the studio’s output, but for now, it’s hard to wish for anything more.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2022"," Audiences had a chance to catch a sneak preview over Thanksgiving weekend. Similarly, Critics Choice Association members had the opportunity to do the same by way of digital screener. I never got around to watching the first film but I caught both in a double feature on Thanksgiving Eve. This one is definitely darker than the first Puss in Boots. This second film feels very different compared to the first one. Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) finds himself on another adventure with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) but he’s facing death–aka the big bad Wolf (Wagner Moura)–in the face this time around. Wolf will almost certainly lead to families having the conversation with their kids. This is a character who wants to bring Puss to his death. Living a life free of fear is something that will take its toll on felines. Early on in the film. Puss finds himself dying for the 8th time and is told to essentially retire, If you know this outlaw feline, it’s impossible to do so. And yet, it’s what sees him going along for the journey with Kitty and therapy dog scene-stealing Perrito (Harvey Guillén) into the Black Forest to find the the Wishing Star. As is typical on such a quest, they are not the only ones looking to make a wish. Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo) are also on the trail. Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and his purple thumb is, too. He’s not so little these days but he has his own agenda. It is to the great credit of DreamWorks Animation and the filmmakers, we find Puss in Boots in quite the predicament. If he can’t be this great fearless adventurer, what then is his identity? It’s everything that defines him, which is what makes the existential crisis such an interesting approach. Going into the film, I had an idea of the five films that I would nominate for Best Animated Feature. Here it is, DreamWorks comes running to say, wait! They bring audiences a mix of thrills, comedy, drama, and wonders. The film needs the comedy in order to help offset the darker dramatic approach. I’m not lying when I say this film gets dark. We’re talking about the Big Bad Wolf as a bounty hunter! There’s been talk of Shrek 5 for so many years that the teaser is a sight for sore eyes. It’s not heavy on Shrek easter egg but you know them when you see them. The film otherwise remains its own thing. I can’t wait to see DreamWorks Animation take us back to FAR FAR AWAY! But I digress. Imagine Sergio Leone’s The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as an animated film and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is exactly what it would look like.

"Dec 20, 2022"," It’s been over 11 years since the last swashbuckling big-screen adventure of self-proclaimed “macho gacho” Puss in Boots. In cat time, that’s what, 44 years? By the memory metrics of either mammal, it’s understandable to have forgotten this particular character from DreamWorks Animation even existed let alone the specifics of his last exploits, which had something to do with a Zach Galifianakis-voiced Humpty Dumpty and that’s as total as the recall gets without a rewatch. But Puss in Boots was good at the time. So is its sequel, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, even though it will likely be memory-holed too and push its predecessor even further down below. At least the inability to remember things from your past plays into the plot here, largely rooted in our heroic stabby tabby’s need to reconcile the flippancy of early exploits into a future as the feline he wants to be. Puss in Boots (again voiced by Antonio Banderas) is about to claim his latest victory, this one over a literal sleeping giant, when he unexpectedly dies in the line of duty. NBD, really. This has happened before. A few times. Puss has nine lives, you know, and he’s used, what, maybe four. Well, actually it’s eight, as a doctor informs him, prompting a montage that includes some questionable decisions with the Pamplona bulls and some YOLN shellfish experimentation. Given his next death will be the last one, this formerly fearless feline feels the weight of mortality — especially concerning given a vulpine form of Death (Wagner Moura) on his tail. So Puss takes the doctor’s suggestion and retreats to a cat rescue where Puss feels both like Rambo in the monastery and, aided by Dan Navarro’s excellent Spanish-language cover of “The End,” Willard in Apocalypse Now. While there, Puss meets Perrito (Harvey Guillén), a dog masquerading as a cat for the food and thrilled to meet a true hero like Puss. When Perrito tells Puss about the Wishing Star — which can grant a single wish to the person who finds it — Puss figures he can simply wish for another nine lives.  So Puss and Perrito escape, only to find they are hardly the only ones searching for the star. There’s Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, Samson Kayo), reimagined as a crime family. There’s “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney), reimagined as a sort of Capone caricature complete with his Bakers’ Dozen of pastry-making lackeys. And there’s Puss’s old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), who throws her lot in with Puss and Perrito. Both in structure and certain specificity, the story is mostly cribbed from Thor: Ragnarok. And if that sounds like too many characters, you’re right, even as they all enunciate with clear enthusiasm for their roles. At least Mulaney rousts something unique and, unsurprisingly, quite funny as Horner, and there’s no use resisting Guillén’s sweet therapy-dog turn as Perrito. (There’s also a brief aside with a Jiminy Cricket composite that gets his biggest test yet of being a conscience for someone.) But the animation compensates as it should — painterly, purposefully variated and often quite beautiful, with dimensionality, shimmer and glimmer like a storybook come to life, sometimes with a blockier graphic-novel effect, with bangs, pow, zips, zooms and even the occasional bursts of blood. It gets a great workout with the map to find the Wishing Star, which changes the terrain based on whomever’s holding it from, say, hell-breathing forests to the amusingly titled Field of Quick and Easy Solutions. While it’s a little bit leery to see a Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse approach bleed into “house style” for two studios, it might help The Last Wish’s nine lives linger a little longer before it tumbles into the memory hole.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2022"," A decade after the adventurous leche-loving feline starred in his first “Shrek” spinoff, the Antonio Banderas-voiced Puss in Boots returns in a new adventure that proves Errol Flynn was not the silver screen’s greatest swashbuckler. After realizing he only has one life left, Puss embarks on a journey to find the mythical Wishing Star picking up former nemesis Kitty Southpaws and new character Perrito an adorable little mutt that dresses like a cat, along the way. The trio goes up against the Three Bears Crime Syndicate and their leader Goldi while managing to stay one step ahead of Death masquerading as a wolf bounty hunter. It’s a rip-roaring good time with plenty of laughs and groundbreaking animation. Directed by Joel Crawford (“The Croods: A New Age”) and co-director Januel Mercado, who first worked together on “Kung Fu Panda 2” and based on the screenplay by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow, the story opens with a rollicking shindig that finds Puss singing, dancing, and buying plenty of rounds of leche for everyone in the house. The festive occasion awakens a sleeping giant which propels our swashbuckler to yell “Holy frijoles” before saving the day and opting to sing another canción. Unfortunately, a giant bell lands on our hero grinding the festivities to a halt as life number eight goes out the window. The local veterinarian warns Puss he only has one life left and in a funny montage shows Puss how he lost each of his eight other lives, however, this doesn’t stop the fearless feline from brushing off the vet’s warning.  After heading to the local watering hole, he encounters a Tex Avery-style wolf (with sharper teeth and minus a zoot suit) voiced by Wagner Moura from “Narcos.” As the scene plays like a 60’s western, it doesn’t take long to figure out the menacing lobo is Death in disguise knocking at Puss’s back door. The confrontation with the wolf causes Puss to rethink his life, and with mortality hanging in the balance, he decides to retire as a domestic house cat living among the strays at a rescue house run by Mama Luma (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) who nicknames him our swashbuckling adventurer, “Pickles.” Life is dull at the retirement home. Puss grows a white beard and makes a new friend, Perrito (Harvey Guillén of “What We Do in the Shadows” fame) a scrawny and annoying little puppy who wears a cat disguise. Remember how Puss stole the show in “Shrek 2”? Perrito, a therapy dog, does the same in “The Last Wish” especially when he keeps asking if anyone would like to rub his belly. A bit of excitement hits Mama Luma’s when bounty hunters Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), “Goldi” for short, and the Three Bears Crime Family (Olivia Coleman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) pay a visit in search of the “legendary” Puss in Boots. When they find his grave instead (where Puss buried his outfit when he retired) they decide to venture out to the Black Forest in search of the mythical Wishing Star. Puss overhears their conversation and bids “adios” to retirement, digging up his costume before embarking on a mission to find the Star first so he can restore his eight lives. The on-again, off-again love interest between Puss and Kitty remains intact as she helps our swashbuckling hero realize that life is special, especially when you only have one. Over the course of the adventure, recognizable faces pop up from the “Shrek” franchise, as we head to a climax based on Sergio Leone’s western classic “The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly”. The film is visually spectacular, not surprising since “Shrek” won the first Best Animated Feature Academy Award just over two decades ago. Once again DreamWorks breaks new ground as Production Designer Nate Wragg forgoes the standard 3D animation we’ve become accustomed to by giving the film a hand-drawn feel, a painterly, illustrated style incorporating CG animation with brushstrokes, in essence giving animators limitless parameters to bring these characters to life. Think of it as an expansion of the concept presented in “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” You’ll laugh and cry but most of all have fun as Banderas and Hayek provide spirited vocal performances while delivering the message that we all have one life so make the most out of it. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is the purr-fect family film this holiday season.

"Dec 20, 2022"," What a cash grab of a sequel! Riding on the mere nostalgia factor by slapping the iconic Puss in Boots and his on-and-off companion, Kitty Softpaws, rehashing the same storyline from the first movie, throw in some pop-culture references and call it a day. Relax! The Puss in Boots sequel is fine and it’s worth the wait after — not counting the six-season The Adventure of Puss in Boots animated series — 11 years (!) since the first movie. But I did initially worry about Puss in Boots for taking so long to come up with a sequel (blame it on the DreamWorks Animations’ major restructuring at the time of the delay) that my interest has already waned by the time I saw the first trailer around nine months ago. Fortunately, the sequel turns out to be better than I expected. The first thing I noticed about Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the significant change in its animation style. It was more of a sketchy comic book-like blend of 2D and 3D visual aesthetics that evokes the distinctive look and feel of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018). It also gives the sequel an overall vibrant-fairy-tale-comes-to-life kind of vibes, making it such a visual feast right from the get-go. The extended opening sequence showcases co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s technical prowess in staging an exuberant mix of comedy and swashbuckling action as we see the return of Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) save a town from the wrath of a stone giant. The intricately-choreographed action sequences, coupled with the acrobatic virtual camera movements are dazzling to look at while Banderas’ charming-as-ever Puss in Boots certainly has the sequel getting off to a promising start. Then, he got killed by a falling bell and finds himself waking up in a town doctor’s (Anthony Mendez) room. Puss in Boots figured it was no big deal he manages to escape from death once again, only to be reminded by the doctor that he has already used up his eight lives with one more left to go. Despite the doctor’s suggestion for him to retire, Puss in Boots refused to do so until he confronts a vicious Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) and lost the battle. Well, long story short, he decided to bury his past and live like a normal cat under the care of a cat lady (Da’Vine Joy Randolph’s Mama Luna). But it’s not for long when Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) are looking for him. Apparently, it has something to do with searching for the Wishing Star capable of fulfilling any wish. Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) is back too and it’s a love-hate relationship again between her and Puss in Boots after their unexpected reunion, and this time, they have a talkative dog Perro (Harvey Guillén) joining them for the quest as well. Okay, some of the jokes are a hit-and-miss affair while the introduction of the oversized “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and his Baker’s Dozen gang members (they are literally bakers using baking tools as makeshift weapons) are nothing more than your standard-issue antagonists. Still, these shortcomings are forgivable, especially given the sequel’s above-average screenplay — credited to Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow — for incorporating surprisingly mature themes of mortality and trust issues. The former is what makes Puss in Boots: The Last Wish a cut above the rest of your usual garden-variety DreamWorks Animation features. We see Puss in Boots who constantly laughs it off about death, only to finally learn the cold bitter truth about facing one himself. This is especially true after he deals with the Big Bad Wolf. The weighty doom-and-gloom subject matter may scare the kids but at the same time, it helps strike a balance for the sequel to appeal to both adults and kids. The sequel also benefits from the excellent voice cast. Banderas brings a mix of swagger and gravitas to his already-iconic role as Puss in Boots. In fact, this is his best voice-acting performance to date and he pairs well with Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws, who both share a terrific, lived-in chemistry. Let’s not forget about Harvey Guillén, who voiced the newcomer dog role as Perro. At first, I figured he was going to be one of those annoying comic-relief sidekicks but beyond his eccentric personality, Perro happens to serve as a moral compass between the bickering Puss in Boots and Kitty Softpaws. Wagner Moura’s perfectly sinister-voiced Big Bad Wolf, complete with glowing red eyes as well as his eerily whistling sound is easily among the best and most fearsome antagonists to date coming from the DreamWorks Animation banner. Finally, there’s Florence Pugh, who made quite a lasting impression as the relentless Goldilocks.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2022"," In times of yore Boxing Day was traditionally held as the time when major blockbuster movie releases were unleashed into cineplexes. This not only provided people with a big buffet of films to choose from but also gave them a strong reason to get out of the house and so help their bodies digest the metric tons of food they’d consumed over Christmas.  There are still some goods films opening, but the usual Boxing Day blockbuster blitz has been nixed by the release of Avatar: The Way of Water, a film that has received a saturation marketing campaign of such intensity that even undiscovered tribes deep in the Amazon jungle have gone online to book tickets.  The best family film is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish ***½ (102 minutes) PG, the boisterous, gag-laden, third film based on the adorably insolent, narcissistic, impeccably attired moggy from the Shrek franchise, voiced by Antonio Banderas.  In this loopy musical escapade, our self-obsessed, celebrity Puss has his ego put through the ringer as he and Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) travel together across a surreal world where his character is continually challenged.  Along for the caper are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), the Three Bears (Olivia Coleman and Ray Winstone as Mamma & Papa Bear), The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) and the deliciously obnoxious, scene-stealing Jack Horner (John Mulaney).  Stuffed with snappy one-liners and visual jokes, PIB3 has far more comic energy than you’d typically expect from a second sequel and has the good sense to work in some terrific action including, of course, some snazzy swordplay.  Another strong Boxing Day treat for the family is the utterly delightful Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile ***1/2 (106 minutes) PG, a rowdy, rambunctious live-action musical comedy about Lyle, a fully-grown crocodile living in the attic of a New York City house.  After the initial shock of being discovered, Lyle – voiced by Shawn Mendes and whose only means of communicating is by singing – is adopted by the family who have just moved in, with the son Josh (Winslow Fegley) being especially attached.  His parents (Constance Wu & Scoot McNairy) also warm to Lyle, after the initial panic usually associated with finding a fully grown saltwater crocodile standing on its hind legs secretly living in your attic. It probably doesn’t help that Lyle’s reaction to being discovered is to promptly give chase while growling angrily.  The wonderfully nutty premise (based on the 1965 children’s book by Bernard Waber) is enthusiastically disposed by directors Josh Gordon & Will Speck (Blades of Glory) who, along with the digitally rendered Lyle, elicit admirably zealous performances from the cast, especially Javier Bardem as Lyle’s exuberant manager Hector P. Valenti, whose juicy, over-the-top performance is arguably more animated than Lyle’s.  No doubt it would have involved a person in a crocodile suit or an animatronic creation, or a mixture of both. But would the visuals have been as satisfactory or as convincing as the lithe and limber Lyle we get here? Probably not. It seems as though the film version of Lyle’s story was one waiting for the technology to evolve to the point where it could do justice to its whacky concept.  From writer/director Martin McDonagh (In Bruges; Three Billboards) comes The Banshees of Inisherin ***1/2 (114 minutes) M, a dry, decidedly dark comedy about two life-long pals whose friendship hits a bump on life’s journey.  Like many others, Pádraic thinks it’s an elaborate gag, but when he challenges his former friend, he painfully discovers how serious Colm is, especially when he threatens to begin chopping off his own fingers each time Pádraic pipes up. It’s a rather expensive way to make a point, its resolute stupidity being one of the themes in the film.  It’s a hallmark of McDonagh’s skill that, for all the film’s mirth, nobody actually tells a joke or deliberately tries to be funny. The humour is all character-based and informs the film’s exploration of the nuances that has soured the jagged relationship between these two men.  Performances are as strong as the accents – don’t panic; you won’t need subtitles – and are thankfully understated. Farrell puts in one of his better turns and Gleeson, as usual, is superb.  In the captivating true-life tale of The Lost King ***1/2 (108 minutes) M we meet Philippa Langley (Sally Hawkins), a timid, overlooked, underappreciated office worker who channels her everyday frustrations – including those of a complicated divorce from her ex-h8usband John (Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film with Jeff Pope) – into an all-consuming investigation searching for the truth about King Richard III.  With an Oscar-worthy central performance by Hawkins and deftly directed by veteran Stephen Frears (Dangerous Liaisons; The Queen; Philomena, etc), the film is an intriguing procedural that follows Philippa’s dogged detective work to locate Richard’s suburban burial site and campaign to restore the much-maligned king’s historical reputation.  Her noble quest is strewn with obstacles, bureaucracy and credit-stealers, yet her admirable conviction and persistence prove that while she might technically be an amateur, her pursuit is far from amateurish.  Philippa’s crusade to rescue Richard’s reputation is also quite topical, tapping quite neatly into the rampant smear culture of today, and the general willingness of people to placidly accept what they’re told about somebody or something wholesale.  What is, perhaps, even more topical is how the realistic and relatable portrait of Philippa as a hero is in stark contrast to the cascade of superheroes bounding forth from every multiplex.

"Dec 20, 2022"," A moment, if you please, for one last bow and sword-sweeping flourish from Antonio Banderas in the guise of perhaps his greatest screen creation, that swashbuckling catnip-to-the-kitties and the kiddies, Puss-in Boots. The star of “Puss-in-Boots: The Last Wish” is so glorious in the part that I’d put the Most Special Spaniard right up there with Robin Williams as giving one of the finest vocal characterizations ever to grace an animated film. With every verbal curlicue, every sexy growl, every rrrrrollled R, the man makes this Dreamworks version of the fairy tale figure a work of art and a tutorial in committing to the character with the best instrument in your acting tool kit — your voice. Banderas brings it in every scene, with every line, as if this is the audition that will make him. As if he wasn’t already a legend.  For his third outing as the the cavalier cat burglar, Banderas and a star-studded ensemble including Salma Hayek (Kitty Softpaws), Florence Pugh (Goldilocks), Oscar-winner Olivia Colman (Mama Bear), Ray Winstone (Papa Bear) and John Mulaney (plum on his thumb Jack Horner) fight with or help the cat cope with his fear of mortality, fear of commitment and ego as Puss stares death right in the face…and runs like a scaredy cat.  The film throws our hero into another epic “I LAUGH at death!” throw-down with a giant whose peace he disturbed with his latest self-celebratory fiesta. But his big finish doesn’t lead to another serving of his favorite dish, “gaassssssssssss-pacho.” Puss gets good and conked.  And the town veterinarian has some bad news for him. He’s used up all but one of his “nine lives.” He’s told to retire. But but… “A legend NEVER dies!” Or so he’s always believed. When a sinister wolf (Wagner Moura, terrific) shows up in a hooded cloak, armed with scythes, Puss finds himself literally fighting for his life for perhaps the first time in his life.  He runs off to live out his days sans hat, sword and boots with a cat lady (Da’Vine Joy Ranolph, a hoot) and her ever-growing brood. The nameless outcast mutt (Harvey Guillén) who disguises himself as a cat just to have a home, only knows him by his Puss’s new name, Pickles. “Puss” must disappear forever, as he grows his beard, eats and eats, learns to use a litterbox and probably wishes the producers had bought the rights to “Memory” for him to sing. All that changes when Goldilocks and her bear gang track Puss down. They’re looking for this wishing star the Dark Forest, specifically an enchanted map that leads to the star. Puss has barely missed being pressed into that job when he realizes that’s how he could get his nine lives back. But he’ll be racing Goldilocks, and the greedy glutton Jack Horner, no longer “Little Jack Horner,” who covets the wishing star for himself. And even teaming up with his old rival and flame Kitty Softpaws is no guarantee he’ll get his lives back. Kitty may have her own wish. And the homely mutt Perrito (little dog) is tagging along, dousing the two caper kitties with a heavy dose of uncool. But in between the sight gags, one liners, bleeped profanity and “Holy frijoles!” this “Puss” flirts with something deeper, recognizing you have one life to live and a little selflessness and serving and needing others is a great part of that. I’d say the best laughs come from the bears and their bossy blonde adoptee, with Winstone growling and singing, Colman vamping it up and Samson Kayo, as Baby Bear, playing the only one with the brass to stand up to the brassy orphan who doesn’t see the ursine family she’s been blessed with as the key to her personal happiness. But it is Banderas who brings home the tocino and serves up the whole jamon when the situation demands it. Which in the case of the immodest, flamboyant and recklessly brave Puss-in-Boots, is pretty much every moment he opens his mouth in his delightful, and perhaps final romp as the character. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2022"," nce upon a time, a wishing star fell from the sky … ” Its impact spawned the Dark Forest, where a single wish buried deep within its midst waits to be found. Meanwhile, the land’s favorite hero, the legendary, fearless Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), a.k.a. “The Leche Whisperer,” attends a fiesta in his honor, where he not-so-reluctantly sings and strums his guitar to a cheering crowd. But the venue is actually in the governor’s home – and Puss in Boots is an outlaw. And so he must sword-fight his way to safety, all while the undulating gathering cheers him on and plays him some exit music. But the fireworks-spewing festivities awaken a forest giant, who tears the roof from the building, requiring additional spontaneous feline heroism. Strangely, the animation style is immediately different – and jarring (intentionally copying the style of previous, successful releases from DreamWorks). It’s reminiscent of anime, but in three-dimensions, yet colored and stylized in somewhat flat shading. Although it’s modern and crisp and unnaturally well-lit, it doesn’t fit with the rest of the series. The animated motions are still as before, but fur, clothing, feathers, elemental effects, and other textures and costumes don’t move as realistically as expected; and action sequences employ motion embellishment imagery like something from a hand-drawn comic strip. Even the villains possess a curious video-game-like cut-scene quality. “No more adventures for you. You need to retire.” At least the initial setup is amusing: Puss has lost track of how many of his lives he’s used up, and is now on his ninth and final one, forcing him to reconsider his daredevilry. Perhaps he needs to seek out Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), who runs a cat sanctuary, where he can become a lap pet. But bounty hunters are still hot on his trail and aren’t likely to let him remain in peace. A few characters return (including some flashback shots of Puss’ prior undertakings), such as Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), but the creative riffs on fairy tales aren’t as prevalent as they used to be. Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her three-bear crime family are moderately engaging, but Perro (Harvey Guillen), a dog pretending to be a cat, doesn’t come from a discernibly famous source – and he’s an integral part of this story. And though Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) does originate from a recognizable nursery rhyme, his character design leaves a lot to be desired. In fact, virtually all of the new characters are visually disagreeable, including supporting henchmen and one-scene walk-ons (save for a conscientious bug doing a Jimmy Stewart impression); the typical combination of scary and cute and funny doesn’t apply much here. Even the voice acting isn’t as exaggerated or as endearing as anticipated – like with the previous pictures’ Gingerbread Man. Most disappointing, however, is the humor. There’s a family-friendly theme of embracing one’s softer side, as well as the power and importance of friendships, but the much-needed, generally dependable laughs aren’t as frequent or as clever as they should be. The central romance between Kitty and Puss isn’t particularly charming either, while the sense of adventure is continually thwarted by uninspired action choreography and stretches of a treasure map path that often feel like filler to elongate a short subject into a feature. The climax, too, suffers from repetition and poorly defined, bland ideas. The production as a whole just isn’t funny or exciting enough to warrant another Puss in Boots episode. “Why are you so ridiculous?” Designed by Mike Massie | © 2006-2024 Gone With The Twins | All movie related images © their respective owners.

"Dec 19, 2022"," It might be hard to believe it today, but there was a time when “Shrek” seemed like a breath of fresh air in the world of big-screen animation. Its salty humor and insistent pop culture knowingness was fun for a minute, before the sequels got nudging and formulaic. And then there was the whole shoving-Smash Mouth-down-our-throat issue. DreamWorks, the studio that concocted “Shrek,” soon enough became the anti-Pixar — in a bad way. So it’s a pleasant surprise that “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” the second feature film highlighting a beloved children’s lit character who became one of the favorite additions to the “Shrek” universe, is for the most part winning. It contains amusing jokes and has an old-fashioned impulse to tug at heart strings. This in spite of the video-game-suggestive plot construction, in which Puss and cohorts, aided by an animated map, race to a dark forest to find a wishing star, with other children’s lore characters in hot, malevolent pursuit. Puss is voiced by Antonio Banderas, whose purr can warm the cockles of any and all, as is also the case with Salma Hayek Pinault, who plays his love-and-hate interest Kitty Softpaws. Directed by Joel Crawford, the movie’s overall tone harks back not so much to prior DreamWorks pictures as it does to the “Fractured Fairy Tales” of the old TV cartoon “Rocky and Bullwinkle.” To this end, Goldilocks and the Three Bears are now a band of criminals (including voice work by the powerhouses Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Florence Pugh). This often charming movie will play particularly well if you’re a cat person. But who’s not?",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2022"," I can’t say as I was excited about another “Puss in Boots” feature film. The Shrek franchise, once one of the freshest things in animation, overstayed its welcome with a mediocre “Shrek the Third,” followed up by “Shrek Forever After,” which was actively awful. So the inevitable 2011 spinoff featuring Antonio Banderas’ swashbuckling feline rogue seemed more like a last gasp than a new start. Everything in life has a beginning, middle and end, and it seemed like the not-so-jolly green ogre and his crew had reached their natural conclusion. So I was surprised they were making another after an 11-year hiatus, and that “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” would arrive in theaters rather than just thrown onto some streaming platform.  No, it’s not nearly as inventive and entertaining as the first two movies. But it’s a combination of revisit and reinvention, as Puss confronts his mortality and comes to know fear for the first time in his life. The movie also boasts zippy action scenes made in the comic book style of “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” where it almost seems like frames were snipped out so characters will strobe across the screen in jerky flashes. And Banderas shows he hasn’t last any of his growly charm as Puss — “your favorite fearless hero,” as he serenades himself in the raucous opening musical number. Things end badly for the hero in this particular adventure, as he finds himself smushed by a massive hill/giant and wakes up at the doctor’s office. His nonchalant attitude is challenged when it’s revealed he’s already used up eight of his proverbial nine cat lives. Things move from self-doubt to utter terror when he encounters a creepy, whistling wolf (Wagner Moura) who bests him in combat, wielding twin scythes as he claims to be the personification of Death himself. Puss retires to the home of an old lady who hosts a veritable army of stray kitties, as well as a sweet but dim puppy, aka Perrito (Harvey Guillén), who has disguised himself as a cat and yearns to become someone’s therapy dog. Puss grows out his beard and considers himself retired from the adventuring life. But there’s always a new quest. In this case, several parties are vying for the opportunity to find the last wishing star that fell somewhere in the enchanted dark forest and make their fondest wishes come true. Puss figures he’ll enter the fray and try to wish all his lost lives back. Perrito tags along, Donkey-style, the annoying, unwanted sidekick who will eventually become his best friend and conscious. He also runs into Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), another feline thief whom he has history with, to be his antagonist/partner/romantic interest. Opposing parties include Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Ray Winston, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo, in descending order of size), here reimagined as their own crew of roving bandits. More malevolent, and completely self-aware about it, is Jack Horner (John Mulaney), now graduated from pie-thumbing to stealing every magic artifact he can find to wield in his quest for power. There’s a magic map hand that keeps changing hands that shows the way to the star, although whoever holds it actually transforms the forest into a different set of challenges reflective of their personality. For example, because Perrito is an empty-headed naïf, his version is a cotton candy-colored land of friendly, winsome critters. The story isn’t terribly inventive. (Screenplay by Paul Fisher with story credits to Tom Wheeler and Tommy Swerdlow.) Puss and his compatriots will go on a journey, both geographically and of the soul, and discover that all the things they’ve been wishing for were already right in the palm of their paw. Directors Joel Crawford (with co-director Januel Mercado) keep things moving at a kid-friendly pace, and most of the big emotional moments land in the middle of fights or other action sequences. So few momentum-stopping talkie scenes. There are plenty of jokey asides and snarky humor to keep parents involved, such as a running attempt by Puss and Kitty to teach Perrito how to perform the enemy-freezing “cute eyes” trick. His version looks more like he’s having a seizure. The animation is different from the other Shrek films. It lacks the rounded warmth, but the colors are more vibrant and everything is crisper. It’s more 2-D and action-oriented, like a comic sprung to life. Could “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” restore life to a defunct franchise? Pay attention to the end for a hint in that direction. All I can say is, if they can recapture this kitty’s energy and marry it to a high-octane visual style, no magic trick is beyond imagination.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2022"," It’s a safe assumption that it will be mostly parents buying the tickets for “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” the latest installment in the adventures of the swashbuckling ginger cat. With that in mind, the takeaway from this review is this: The main villain, the Big Bad Wolf, is likely to give any kid under 7 nightmares. (Parents: You may long for the days of teething and sleep regression. This character is scary.) Voiced by Wagner Moura, who earned a Golden Globe nomination for playing the drug kingpin Pablo Escobar in “Narcos,” BBW is only one of several villains here — and that’s a problem. Throughout the film, Puss (Antonio Banderas) has to face down a rogue’s gallery of fairy tale and nursery rhyme baddies: gangster Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and his crew, as well as Papa, Mama and Baby Bear (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo), who now run a smash-and-grab operation with adopted daughter Goldilocks (Florence Pugh), whose opposable thumbs come in handy for the grabbing. The real enemy, though, is time itself; after a swooping, flying, visually fun opening battle, Puss learns that he has just run through his eighth of nine lives. The imminent loss of quasi-immortality sends Puss into a funk. He’s then snatched up by Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a crazy cat lady who has unwittingly taken in a dog masquerading as a feline: Perro (Harvey Guillén), who dreams of becoming a therapy dog. Eliminating all risk is the only thing Puss can think of to do, so he eats and sleeps and not much else — until learning of a magical star that can reset his nine lives if he wishes on it. He reunites with Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) from the last film and — with Perro in tow — sets off. Rendered like the Grim Reaper, and wielding lethal hooks straight out of “I Know What You Did Last Summer,” the Big Bad Wolf has his sights on Puss. Snow White’s stepmother notwithstanding, it’s rare for a children’s movie villain to so explicitly want to kill the hero, and the dark tone is jarring. Moura’s excellent voice performance matches the menacing visuals, and Puss’s abject terror is palpable whenever his pursuer is nearby. To be clear: The Big Bad Wolf’s portrayal isn’t necessarily a bad choice, but one parents should be aware of. The rest of the movie is a pleasant enough jumble. Banderas — who originated the role of Puss 18 years, four movies and a pile of “Shrek” specials ago — still manages to find new vocal delivery for his famous introduction: “I am Puss (long pause) in boots”; “I. Am. Pussinboots.”; “I am! Puss! In! Booots!” He also continues to give the character surprising depth. In her first foray into voice acting, Pugh proves to be just as good behind a mic as she is in front of a camera. At the same time, her character could have used some writers familiar with adoption and adoption trauma, particularly for those children living in a family that doesn’t look like them. The story features several character cameos from folklore — all from the Western canon, unfortunately — along with a few solid wink-wink-nudge-nudge jokes thrown in to keep parents from drowning in a pool of ennui. The battle scenes often border on the chaotic, without ever becoming too crowded or confusing. “The Last Wish” arrives just in time to give families something to do after all the presents have been unwrapped and the threat of Santa’s naughty list isn’t enough to avert cries of “I’m so borrred.” And sometimes that’s enough: Kill an hour or two, laugh, call it a day. The bar isn’t terribly high here, but Puss and company clear it comfortably, landing — but of course — on their feet.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2022"," Is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish safe for kids? Is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish OK for children? Read the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parents guide and mom review of the all-new DreamWorks animated Puss in Boots sequel film within the Shrek spin-off universe, starring Antonio Banderas and Selma Hayek Pinault. No spoilers! #PussinBoots #TheLastWish May contain commissioned links. It’s been over 10 years since the 2011 release of the original Puss in Boots film. And this popular character spin-off from the Shrek movie franchise is hoping to live his best, last life. But let’s face it; this cat hasn’t always scratched at our heartstrings when it comes to successful DreamWorks franchise sequels. Is this long awaited Puss in Boots sequel worth the wait? Or should this hero cat have hung up his boots years ago (like Shrek 3)? In This Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, I’m breaking down the visuals, the story, a full PG age rating explanation for violence, adult themes and language, and what kids’ age recommendation is suggested to watch in the new 2022 Puss in Boots: The Last Wish parents guide to the new Puss in Boots 2/Shrek spin-off film. A no-spoiler parent review of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, has DreamWorks overstayed their welcome this holiday season? Even a ginger cat can change his stripes. DreamWorks soars once again with high quality CGI animation that rivals that of Disney. Sharp details as small as individual strands of fur, bright colors and creative landscapes make the Puss in Boots 2 sequel visuals a cat above the rest. Quick shift into choppy anime-style 2D animation for some of the action sequences may be a welcome switch – or really annoying. I honestly didn’t mind the play on popular modern day genre animation, very similar to Into the Spider-verse. Directed by Joel Crawford and produced by Mark Swift, Antonino Banderas (“The Mask of Zorro“) returns as as the iconic DreamWorks character in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. The voice cast also features Salma Hayek Pinault (“Frida“) as Kitty Softpaws, Harvey Guillén (“Reacher“) as Perro, Florence Pugh (“Black Widow“) as Goldilocks, Olivia Colman (“The Crown“), Ray Winstone (“Point Break“), and John Mulaney (“Spider-man: Into the Spider-verse“) as Jack Horner. Fully preparing myself for another 2009 Puss in Boots (or let’s face it, anything after Shrek 2) letdown, I found that going into the film with such low expectations was surprisingly helpful. 11-years did the kitty good, as Puss in Boots aged as a fine wine instead of a rotted fish. DreamWorks got back to their roots and the successful animated movie formula – with tons of clichés, visual gags, cameos, embedded adult humor, new characters, and another clever, yet dark fairy tale story. I was surprised to see less of modern day pop culture references that DreamWorks/Shrek movies are known for. However, this Puss in Boots 2 sequel felt more like a close cousin of Shrek 2 with lots of life lessons for kids (family, love, overcoming fear, carpe diem), along with action, adventure and entertainment for the whole family. Is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish safe for kids? Has DreamWorks gone too far with the Puss in Boots adult humor? Should parents be concerned that the 2022 Shrek spin-off is too much after a 10-year movie hiatus? It’s no secret that I am highly skeptical of all MPAA ratings (um hello, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not disclosing any language??). And as we know, not all movie and TV age ratings are the same. As a parent, it’s been rather heartbreaking to witness how ratings have shifted over the years with a G-rating no longer an option. PG ratings now oscillating between Turning Red intense to Christopher Robin calm, there’s a wide range between the age of 0-12 years old for parents to consider. Having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie is really kid friendly – and safe for the whole family to watch together. Why is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish rated PG? In this Puss in Boots: The Last Wish Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, this DreamWorks Puss in Boots sequel film is rated PG for “action/violence, rude humor, language and some scary moments.” With film and TV ratings also unpredictable these days, having fully disclosed parent guidelines can help determine if a movie or television show like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is kid friendly. Is Puss in Boots: The Last Wish too scary for kids? Let’s breakdown that PG age rating in this Puss in Boots: The Last Wish parents guide. Violence/Suspense. The action/violence is about what I would expect for a Shrek-like movie. There’s some swash-buckling sword fighting, use of medieval weapons such as crossbows, hatchets and other handheld weapons, and mild hand-to-hand fighting and kicking. Small amounts of animated blood, cuts, and scars seen as well, along with quick shots of “sickly” looking animals that may scare small children.  Multiple verbal references to “murder” and “murdering.” Multiple scenes of one scary/violent character with red eyes that might be nightmare territory for small kids. I would compare this character as “next level” bad guy scary when compared to Lord Farquaad or Fairy Godmother, and closer to a Bruno of Encanto in the early scenes. There are dark fantasy/fairy-tale themes and other potentially scary looking characters to consider as well. However, discussion of multiple cruel animal abuse scenarios for a punchline was the most concerning scene for me. The description and heavy discussion of multiple attempts to end the life of a pet for a cheap laugh felt extremely dark and cruel, even for DreamWorks. Adult Themes. Rude humor certainly falls under this category. As Puss in Boots: The Last Wish definitely continues the Shrek-like humor legacy. While very appealing to both kids and adults, some of the verbal jokes and visual gags have a tendency of going a paw too far for some sensitive kids and parents. Mild toilet humor present including cat cliché of using a litter box, peeing into a toilet (nothing “seen,” but visual in place), visual toilet references. Discussion of death, fear of death, visuals of ways to die, and being “dead inside.” Mild discussion of “therapy” in regards to mental health. Visual and verbal reference to “witch hunting.” Mild scenes of acting “drunk,” holding a beer stein, and stumbling around. Two quick scenes of a man in his underwear. And one quick disturbing scene of person (inferred nakedness, but nothing seen) in bathtub with a cat. Language. Overall, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is very mild for foul language. One “H-E-double-hockey-sticks” reference, and 2 mentions of the word “crap” is about as bad as the language references get, which is a great relief to this Shrek-loving mom. A cut-off “bullsh-” is also said, along with a few audio bleeps to infer the use of foul language. However, the milder insults include bad words and phrases are more numerous for possible sensitive parents and children: “shut up,” “heck,” “hate,” “butt nugget,” “pooping,” “idiot,” “stupid,” “fat,” “dumb,” “jerks,” and “creep.” At a runtime of 1 hour 42 minutes, DreamWorks’ Puss in Boots: The Last Wish sequel film is right in the sweet spot for kids and families. With visually stunning animation, lots of action/adventure, signature Shrek-like humor to appeal to kids and adults, and a clever storyline, DreamWorks does it once again – another kid movie success.There are some slower dialogue scenes, use Spanish language dialect and phrases that may be confusing for little ones, and scary scenes to consider for parents. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is very comparable to the first 2 Shrek films. A good-paced story, packed action/adventure, adult and kid humor, visual interest, and dark fairy-tale themes – sticks to the DreamWorks animated film formula. Based on my Puss in Boots: The Last Wish parents guide, PG rating breakdown and mom review above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to kids younger than the age of 5-6 years old.My 9-year old daughter was easily frightened by the one particular scary character during the first couple of scene appearances. Overall, she was able to calm down and overcome her fear by the end of the movie, but the character did leave an impression on her sensitive spirit. Considering the full PG rating breakdown above, this parent movie reviewer would not recommend Puss in Boots: The Last Wish to kids younger than the age of 5-6 years old.This Puss in Boots: The Last Wish rating is easily comparable to the Shrek and Puss in Boots movie series ratings. But note that the one particular scary character is “next level” when compared to Lord Farquaad or Fairy Godmother – more comparable to Bruno in Encanto in the early scenes. If your kids loves Shrek, they will love this 2022 Puss in Boots movie. I still recommend parents to prescreen Puss in Boots: The Last Wish for rude humor, scary sequences and language. Suavemente. This cat’s got my tongue. He may have 9 lives, but Puss is Boots: The Last Wish was worth the 11-year wait. After 10+ years, this cat hasn’t lost his ability to charm families – purr-fectly. Living his “last life” to the fullest, Puss in Boots is filled with action, adventure, humor, and a solid storyline on the same level as Shrek and Shrek 2. Holding his head high and wowing audiences with enrapturing visuals, modern day humor, and dark fairy tale clichés, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a rare sequel that is surprisingly better than the original.

"Dec 19, 2022"," In the current climate of Hollywood, in which the maintenance of intellectual property rights often takes precedence over innovation, artistry, or even simple entertainment value, few prospects could seem dimmer than a belated sequel to a spin-off of the Shrek franchise. And yet, director Joel Crawford’s Puss in Boots: The Last Wish defies the odds, vaulting over not only the low expectations that the wary filmgoer might’ve set for it, but achieving something all too rare in the realm of children’s animated features: genuine delight. A pleasantly over-stuffed shaggy-dog tale that moves at a breakneck pace, The Last Wish opens with a rip-roaring swashbuckling musical sequence that evokes the hammy hyper-masculinity of Vincente Minnelli’s The Pirate. The dauntless Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) leads a sing-along ode to his own greatness before slaying a fearsome monster. But just as it seems Puss can do no wrong, he gets conked in the face by a bell and falls to his demise. This death, the swaggering feline’s eighth, causes Puss to face up to his mortality, at least for a little while. In the film’s funniest sequence, he lies low in an overpopulated shelter run by a kooky cat lady named Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), where he grows a retirement beard and is forced to queue up to use the house’s shared litterbox, “where dignity goes to die.” Eventually, though, Puss catches wind of a mythical Wishing Star, which, he hopes, will allow him to replenish his lost lives, so he teams up with a chipper young pup (Harvey Guillén) and his old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), on a quest to find this mythical talisman. Largely eschewing the more realistic 3D animation style of the Shrek films, The Last Wish opts for a painterly, storybook look that suits its mock-fairytale narrative. Crawford’s film bears the traces of its lengthy production history, during which Guillermo del Toro and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse co-director Bob Persichetti were both attached to direct. The Last Wish’s action sequences employ the herky-jerky wham-bam-pow comic-book style of Spider-Verse, while some of its character designs, such as the grotesquely ill-proportioned villain “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney) and a crimson-eyed lupine bounty hunter who looks like a cross between The Seventh Seal’s Death and the Space Coyote from Homer Simpson’s chili-induced hallucination, bear the apparent influence of del Toro’s imagination. The film happily metabolizes a wide range of inspirations, everything from the devil-may-care adventure films of Errol Flynn to Sergio Leone’s spaghetti westerns to Apocalypse Now. While there may be nothing particularly new in any of The Last Wish’s reference points and parodies, the Looney Tunes-like joy with which they’re delivered is nevertheless infectious. With its multiple antagonists, constant scene hopping, and rapid-fire action set pieces, The Last Wish is certainly busy. An attempt to wring pathos out of a subplot involving Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) in which they’re imagined as a cockney crime family feels particularly strained. But there’s so many witty throwaway gags, so much texture and detail in the film’s visual palette, and such exuberance in the performances—Banderas in particular seems to be having a blast tweaking his brooding lothario persona—it’s hard to care too much. And given that big-studio children’s animation so often feels like it was created by algorithm, it’s refreshing to see a kid’s cartoon like The Last Wish that’s filled with too many ideas rather than too few.",POSITIVE

"Dec 17, 2022"," Han pasado ya varios años desde que salió la última película de “Gato con Botas” —y varios años, también, desde que pudimos ver a Shrek, Burro y Fiona en la pantalla grande. Pero parece que la gente de Dreamworks Animation quiere traer a este mundo de vuelta de manera mucho más estilizada y colorida, y “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” es el primer intento de ello. Lo que tenemos acá es una secuela muy distinta a su predecesora a nivel visual, pero que termina funcionando precisamente por lo atractiva que termina siendo, inyectándole algo de frescura y energía a la franquicia. Honestamente, no esperaba demasiado de “Gato con Botas: el último deseo”, y sin embargo terminó sorprendiéndome gratamente. Lógicamente, el protagonista de la película es el Gato con Botas (voz de Antonio Banderas), un aventurero y criminal que la pasa de lo lindo viajando por toda España. Son esas aventuras, sin embargo, las que traen consigo consecuencias previamente inimaginables. Como todo buen felino, el Gato con Botas cuenta con nueve vidas… y ya ha gastado ocho de ellas. Es por eso que decide ir en busca del Último Deseo, con la esperanza de recuperar sus vidas pasadas, y poder seguir viviendo despreocupadamente. Para ello, contará con la ayuda de Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), otra gata aventurera, y de un perrito llamado… Perrito (Harvey Guillén). Pero no estarán solos. Hay otros personajes que les seguirán el rastro, también interesados en el deseo: están Ricitos de Oro (la gran Florence Pugh) y los tres osos (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman y Samson Kayo), y Jack Horner (John Mulaney), quien cuenta con una bolsa mágica de la que puede sacar prácticamente todo. Y por si eso no fuera poco, el Gato con Botas también está siendo perseguido por la mismísima Muerte (Wagner Moura), quien se muere (ja) por llevárselo consigo de una vez por todas. La historia en “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” no es nada del otro mundo, pero al menos sirve como excusa para desarrollar algunos temas inesperadamente oscuros y hasta sorprendentes. Me gustó mucho, por ejemplo, que la película tenga bastante qué decir sobre la muerte —y sobre cómo nuestras vidas se hacen más valiosas, precisamente, porque sabemos que moriremos eventualmente. Y también transmite mensajes relacionados a las cosas a las que le damos importancia en nuestras vidas —y cómo a veces nos empecinamos tanto en encontrar algo, que nos perdemos de lo que verdaderamente nos hace feliz. Son temas, pues, algo densos —especialmente para estándares de una película animada—, que felizmente son presentados con aplomo en “Gato con Botas: el último deseo”. Porque realmente resulta refrescante ver una película animada americana mainstream que no tiene miedo de hablar sobre la muerte. Es un tema que puede resultar tabú para ciertos adultos, a la hora de conversar con los niños, pero que es tratado con total naturalidad acá. Quizás no es un tratamiento temático tan complejo y emotivo como el que pueden ver en “Pinocho de Guillermo del Toro”, pero inesperadamente, ambas películas —salvando las distancias— parecen tener ideas similares. Evidentemente lo que tenemos acá es una experiencia más ligera y sencilla, pero no por eso menos interesada en decir ALGO con la narrativa. Nada mal, considerando que se trata de la secuela de un spin-off de “Shrek”. Por otro lado, “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” también resalta, como se dio a entender líneas arriba, gracias a su estilo visual, Inspirándose en filmes animados como “Spider-man: un nuevo universo”, o “Los chicos malos”, del mismísimo Dreamworks, “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” hace uso de elementos en 2D y en 3D, líneas de movimiento claras, color y hasta framerates variables, para desarrollar un estilo muy llamativo, que por momentos le permite a la película sentirse casi como un cómic en movimiento. Es todo muy llamativo, especialmente durante las secuencias de acción, energéticas y muy divertidas. Puede que esta segunda parte luzca muy distinta a la primera, pero el cambio definitivamente se ha hecho para bien. De hecho, me encantaría ver una película de “Shrek” con este estilo visual. ¡Habrá que esperar! Las actuaciones de voz en general ayudan a otorgarle mucha personalidad a los protagonistas de “Gato con Botas: el último deseo”. Como siempre, Antonio Banderas está genial como el protagonista del título —arrogante, enérgico, y más solitario de lo que él cree. Como Kitty, Salma Hayek logra presentarnos a una buena contraparte para el Gato. Harvey Guillén está muy divertido como Perrito —y felizmente nunca se torna desesperante—, y Florence Pugh (y su gran voz rasposa), Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman y Samson Kayo interpretan a Ricitos y los Osos, respectivamente, de la manera más británica posible. Finalmente, John Mulaney no está mal como Jack Horner —aunque luego de haberlo escuchado en “Spider-man: un nuevo universo” (como Spider-Ham) Y en “Chip y Dale al Rescate” (como una de las ardillas del título), su presencia puede llegar a distraer un poco. Francamente, no me esperaba que “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” estuviese así de bien. Considerando lo popular que es, todavía, la franquicia de “Shrek”, la gente de Dreamworks no tendría por qué haberse esforzado tanto con esta secuela… y sin embargo lo hicieron. Sí, el guion es algo previsible, pero disfruté de los temas presentados por la historia, y por supuesto, del estilo visual, lleno de colores fuertes, constante movimiento, y mucha expresividad. Puede que “Gato con Botas: el último deseo” termine convirtiéndose en la gran sorpresa del cine para este fin de año; el boca a boca (¿u hocico a hocico?) debería ser lo suficientemente potente, como pata atraer a varias familias a las salas de cine.

"Dec 17, 2022","  The DreamWorks incarnation of the fairy tale character Puss in Boots has been an enduring piece of the studio since the concept debuted in 2004's Shrek 2. Playing the character across multiple films, the legendary Antonio Banderas has always given the character a silky smooth side that only added to his comically over-the-top confidence and ego. Now, almost two decades since his first appearance, his latest film reckons with age in some surprisingly powerful and consistently entertaining ways. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fantastic-looking animated film with a compelling emotional core that handles its story with grace and humor.   Picking up some undisclosed time since his last adventure, Puss in Boots has spent the intervening years continuing to spread his legend throughout the fantastical world of fairy tale creatures. After his latest act of heroism gets him killed, Puss learns from a doctor that he's down to his final life. Confronted with his mortality for the first time -- literally, in the form of a mysterious wolf (Wagner Moura) that follows him around with a pair of blades -- Puss goes into hiding, seeking out a quiet but longer life. When he learns of a map to a fallen star that could grant any wish, however, he embarks on a quest to recover it and regain his lives and sense of self. Alongside his accidental sidekick -- the cartoonishly naive Perro (Harvey Guillén) -- Puss races to collect the map, all while staying ahead of old friends and new enemies alike.   What's striking about Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is that it deals with some straightforward but deep emotional beats, handling them with deft care. Puss gets a sympathetic exploration of what a self-styled fearless man becomes when terrorized, and it deals with some quietly mature elements. Banderas is having a blast as always in the lead role, but the more dramatic signs of weary age seeping into the performance work to the story's benefit, lending the animated action a really great piece of grounded character work.   This emotional bedrock for the film allows other elements to fully develop to their purpose in the story, meaning even the less complex features have time to be fully formed and fleshed out. Perro and a returning Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) get sweet minor stories within Puss' orbit, enhancing his story while retaining their own agency. Comedian John Mulaney gets to play Jack Horner as a complete goofball of a bad guy, giving the hulking Horner a completely deadpan approach to villainy that works comically. By contrast, the story of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her adopted family Papa (Ray Winstone), Mama (Olivia Colman), and Baby (Samson Kayo) is a surprisingly effective emotional arc that's fittingly reflective of Puss' and effectively constructed, even while being heavily telegraphed.   That might actually sum up Puss in Boots: The Last Wish in a nutshell. Most of its run-time follows very obvious storytelling signposts, with the film's narrative twists being clearly telegraphed. However, the film isn't relying on those twists -- it's using them to further expand the main cast. None of it feels wasted or unnecessary, and the level of craft brought by the filmmakers elevates it even further. The film's best moments of motion and movement feel reminiscent of The Mitchells vs. The Machines or Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. The fight scenes move with an artistic flourish and flash of inventive staging, all choreographed with plenty of subtle character. The visual team gives the film a real sense of energy, improving on already great beats.   While it's not the most revolutionary thing in the world, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish tells a good story well, with strong acting and impressive visuals. The movie is a quietly great capstone for the titular character, an accessible exploration of age, trauma, and doubt without losing its sense of fun and adventure. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish may be the sharpest entry in the Shrek franchise and a serious highlight of the Dreamworks library.  If the first trailer for Rise of the Beasts is anything to go by, Transformers, not humans, will finally get the spotlight in their upcoming movie. There's a flood of new TV shows based on video games, and old classics. Between new and old, a few stand out as being the best.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2022"," Gato con botas: El último deseo (Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, 2022) empieza con todo. El gato con botas (voz de Antonio Banderas) hace gala de sus actitudes heroicas y triunfantes frente al pueblo que lo alaba como un Dios. Personaje narcisista y divertido reafirma su leyenda en una enorme secuencia inicial llena de despliegue escénico, efectos visuales y virtuosos movimientos de cámara. Lo difícil ante estos prometedores arranques es mantener el ritmo y la tensión después. Es lo que le sucede al film dirigido por Joel Crawford, que si bien plantea con mucha gracia la pérdida de las 8 de las 9 vidas del protagonista, que lo deposita en un hogar mundano junto a otros gatos para tener una vida ordinaria, luego empezará a presentar una gran cantidad de personajes secundarios, cada uno con sus historias pasadas, que ramifican la trama y agotan al espectador. Algunos personajes son muy buenos, el problema es la cantidad. Primero tenemos el regreso de Kitty Patitas Suaves (voz en castellano de Veronica López Treviño), la versión femenina del gato con botas. Luego la presentación de Perrito (voz en español de Harvey Guillen), un peculiar chihuahua que oficia de personaje cómico, una especie de burro para Shrek, responsable de los momentos de humor del film. En el medio aparece la posibilidad de encontrar la Estrella de los deseos y con ella recuperar las vidas perdidas del gato con botas y así evitar el acecho de Lobo Feroz, una suerte de parca que sigue de cerca al protagonista. Pero en el camino por conseguir la estrella en cuestión, el gato con botas hará equipo con Kitty y Perrito y disputará el trofeo con Ricitos de Oro y sus tres osos, cuyas voces en español son de los argentinos Julieta Nair Calvo, Patricia Etchegoyen, Axel Kutchevatzky y Mariano Chiesa. Aunque a la carrera por conseguir la Estrella se suma también el gran Jack Horner y su ejército de pasteleros. Una infinidad de personajes que tendrá cada uno su presentación ralentizando el avance de la trama. Dicho esto, Gato con botas: El último deseo es una película que funciona, roba algunas sonrisas con los lugares comunes de los gatos domesticados ante los ojos del resistido protagonista y su espíritu heroico. Hay que tener en cuenta también que la colorida aventura se piensa a sí misma como un capítulo más del universo Shrek y no como una mega película para quedar en la historia. Y el resultado es acorde a sus objetivos.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 16, 2022"," Puss in Boots is facing an existential crisis in his latest feature, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” the sequel to the 2011 solo outing that’s still anchored within the “Shrek” universe. Puss in Boots, once again voiced by the great Antonio Banderas, is coming to terms with reality and his lavish no regrets lifestyle isn’t as concrete anymore. Co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado (with a script by Paul Fisher) have a great time both meshing with various animated styles (reflecting something more akin to “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” as opposed to what you’ll remember from the “Shrek” canon) and the characters at hand which, thanks to all of the above plus its sincere thoughtfulness, offers a major improvement over its predecessor.  Puss in Boots maintains a loose cannon attitude until he realizes all eight of his nine lives have been depleted (each demise is depicted in a hilarious montage). The film opens with a hypercaffeinated brawl between Puss and an angry giant that’s now put our favorite orange feline at death’s literal door step. It’s advised he hangs up the sword and swashbuckling escapades even if it means becoming something he’s not: a lazy house pet. Afraid at what might be coming, Puss recends into hiding, growing a chiseled beard, and wearing booties on his paws while being overseen by a crazy cat lady.  But it’s not all doom and gloom as various fairytale characters and animals, including Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh) and her family of three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winston, and Samson Kayo) and Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) are searching for a mystical Wishing Star which has the power to grant any wish one time. And before you can say “pray for mercy…” Puss is back in the saddle, joined by his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a new canine pal named Perro (voiced by “What We Do in the Shadows” alum Harvey Guillén - who is quite terrific), an adorable pup who doesn’t possess a single negative thought and is the absolute cutest. He’s just thrilled to have friends.  “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is essentially a race-against-the-clock adventure where our heroes and villains traverse a vast (and eye-popping) Candy Land-esq terrain as they make a pilgrimage towards the Wishing Star. Along the way, Puss is chased by his own vision of death, manifested as The Big Bad Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), and the crew is thrown into some wild and zany battles. With its array of impressive visuals (at times resembling a comic strip) and a narrative that’s more engrossing, “The Last Wish” isn’t short on style points. Throw in a catchy opening musical number and the movie gels for 100-minutes. Not bad for a sequel over a decade removed from its past installment where nobody knew if it could deliver. Hopefully it’s not that long before we see these characters again. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2022",The Last Wish is spectacularly entertaining&#44; surprisingly emotional and honing a maturity that breathes new life into the long dormant Shrek franchise&#46;,POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2022"," Maybe not my last wish, but I certainly wouldn’t mind listening to Antonio Banderas swashbuckle away as Puss in Boots forever. In this, the latest chapter of the Shrek series, the original voice actors are back and this time, they’re facing, amazingly enough, mortality. Yep. Mortality. The end of the road. In a cartoon. Well, an animated movie, aimed, primarily at children. Of course, this isn’t the first time animation has gone serious. Up, the Toy Stories and Inside Out had many of us sobbing. And, while I wasn’t in tears at this storyline, or its dandy enactment, I was surprised and impressed at the respect this film has for its audience, reminding us not just of the shortness of life but of what is really important in the time we have in it. Puss, you see, has gotten grave news. After living so cavalierly for so long, the doctor has counted things up and our beloved cat is now up to his 9th life. One more fight, one more accident and that’s it. And suddenly, Puss’s bravado is melting. He’s got to be super careful now. Unless. Unless he can venture into the Black Forest and find that Wishing Star and wish for his former lives to start again. It’s an adventure, one with allies and enemies, including a mutt named Perro, the returning Kitty, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, “Big” Jack Hormer and the Big Bad Wolf. The somewhat unsurprising arc of the story is given irresistible life by a fine group of voice actors, including Salma Hayek, Florence Pugh, Ray Winstone, Olivia Coleman and John Mulaney. They are all a delight, but it’s Banderas who gets me every time. I would love a video peek at how he creates his Puss in the studio. But for now, I’ll just have to imagine each swoop, plea and smile. And that’s pretty fun, too.",POSITIVE
"Dec 16, 2022"," Antonio Banderas returns as Puss, the Leche-loving swashbuckler along with Salma Hayek’s Kitty Softpaws in a sequel that far surpasses the original in every way. Puss in Boots stole the show when the cat debuted in 2004’s SHREK 2, and more than a decade has passed since Dreamworks Animation's stand-alone film featured the fear-defying feline. Puss isn’t the only one seeking the Wishing Star. Fairy tale favorites Goldi Locks (voiced by Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone) join the fun as a cockney-speaking crime family willing to do anything to reach the prize. A not-so-little Jack Horner (voiced by John Mulaney) is also on the same quest as is the big, bad Wolf (Narco’s Wagner Moura), the grim reaper waiting to rip Puss out of existence. THE LAST WISH is full of charm and emotion with themes that everyone can relate to. The swashbuckling cat shows his sensitive side when he fears his days are numbered. Banderas strikes the right tone when Puss loses his confidence which endears you to the character even more. Humbling Puss in that manner was a genius plot twist because who wants more of the same!  However, you’ll fall in love with a new character who chews up every scene. Harvey Guillen voices a little mutt Puss names Perrito. Perrito is the Olaf of this Dreamworks sequel. His innocence is simply adorable, and the character brings a lot of heart into the animated film. You’ll want to take him home. The voice cast is just phenomenal. John Mulaney delivers the perfect pitch as Jack Horner, a selfish, petulant child while Florence Pugh, Olivia Coleman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo make a great team as Goldi and the Three Bears crime family. Hayek-Pinault also returns with a softer side to Kitty in a much bigger role. The sequel to PUSS IN BOOTS is by far a better movie. The first stand-alone was extremely entertaining, but THE LAST WISH tugs at your heartstrings and mind. The characters all seek something very human in their quest. The “grass is always greener” quote comes to mind when watching PUSS IN BOOTS 2. Every frame is filled with popping colors that dazzle, and the animation feels very immersive as if watching it in 3D. THE LAST WISH surpasses the original in story and visuals.  The Spanglish wordplay among the three Latino leads is perfectly blended. It’s done just right and Latino families will no doubt feel proud to be represented on screen.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2022"," When his gleeful celebration of himself awakens the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is quick to fell it in front of cheering crowds.  But after a dislodged bell lands on him, Puss is startled to learn he’s used up 8 of his 9 lives and The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is coming for him with dual scythes.  Puss tries to retire in anonymity, but upon learning of a map that points to a wish hidden in the Dark Forest, he buckles his swash and sets out to secure it for himself in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” When his gleeful celebration of himself awakens the Sleeping Giant of Del Mar, Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is quick to fell it in front of cheering crowds.  But after a dislodged bell lands on him, Puss is startled to learn he’s used up 8 of his 9 lives and The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura) is coming for him with dual scythes.  Puss tries to retire in anonymity, but upon learning of a map that points to a wish hidden in the Dark Forest, he buckles his swash and sets out to secure it for himself in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.” It has been a while since we’ve experienced the world of Shrek, but while the green ogre doesn’t appear here, other fairy tale characters join the race to procure the prize left by the Wishing Star with a story by “Puss in Boots’s” Tommy Wheeler and Tommy Swerdlow (""The Grinch”) that plays like a ‘choose your own adventure’ video game inspired by “The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.”
After the musical opening featuring the cocksure Puss we know and love, we suddenly find a gato knocked down a few pegs by a Doctor (Anthony Mendez) who reminds him of all the lives he treated carelessly, the counting down of Puss’s prior deaths a comedic highlight.  After a run in with The Big Bad Wolf, a red-eyed beast in a black hooded cloak who suggests something grim (Grimm?) and to whom he loses his sword, Puss buries the remains of his identity and erects a giant ‘P’ over the grave.  He arrives at local cat lady Mama Luna’s (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) where he is renamed Pickles and hopes to be left alone (a cover of The Doors ‘The End’ plays on the soundtrack), but attracts the attention of a miniature mutt disguised with a felt cat hat whom he dubs Perro ('What We Do in the Shadows'' Harvey Guillén).  But Puss’s disguise proves short-lived when the Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears crime family discover his ruse and soon they are all vying for the map rumored to be held by Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney).  Puss will be the most surprised to see who’s beaten them to the punch – his old rival and romantic interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek).
Directors Joel Crawford (""The Croods: A New Age"") and Januel Mercado largely lean on the type of CGI we’re accustomed to in Shrek world, mixing things up a bit with animated maps which change depending on whose hand or paw rests upon it that appear hand drawn and a more stylized, angular look for Puss when he faces off with the Wolf.  While the story leans on such clichés as families built by circumstance (Goldilocks learns that life with Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Colman) and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) is ‘just right’ after all, for example), its mixture of Western concepts with fairy tale characters lends many chuckles.  Horner, an odious looking creature and bully of a bakery shop owner, enlists his ‘Bakers’ Dozen,’ a motley crew bearing twelve different weapons, but also hosts Ethical Bug, a cricket in a top hat who sounds like Jimmy Stewart and is aghast by the conscience he attempts to guide.  There are references to Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz and Puss’s infamous cute eyes are given an amusing upgrade when Perrito, as he comes to be known, pops a blood vessel when he finally succeeds in making them.
And it is Perrito who is the scene stealer here, the upbeat oddball with the heartbreaking history a serious game changer for the franchise.  After eleven years, we can hear the aging in Banderas’s voice, Puss even given a long white beard for the film’s midsection, but there’s life in this old cat yet and the filmmakers land on just the right note to pivot into a new adventure.

Puss (Antonio Banderas) has lived as a swashbuckling adventurer always willing to put his life on the line for good, and sometimes not so good, reasons. But this comes at a cost and our feline hero has used up eight of his nine lives. The Grim Reaper, in the guise of the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), is coming for the cat in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.”
When we meet our feline hero, he is vanquishing yet another foe. Then, he sees he is being pursued by a very large wolf with not very nice intentions. This begins Puss’s story of his fall from legend and descent into the realm of “lap cat.” While living his new, docile life in the home of uber cat owner Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), he meets a small dog, Perro (Harvey Guillen), disguised as a cat.
Things are not exactly exciting in his new home and there is no adventure. That changes when Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bear Crime family – Papa Bear (Ray Winstone), Mama Bear (Olivia Coleman) and Baby Bear (Samson Kayo) - come looking for Puss to collect the sizable bounty on his head.
Unintentionally, they let the cat out of the bag, so to speak, when they reveal a map to the Wishing Star that grants a single wish. Puss’s new mission is to find the star and make the wish that will get his lost lives back. But, everyone else, including Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney), wants the wish for themselves and for their own selfish reasons.
Enter Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss’s old squeeze who he left at the altar – he thinks. But, she also wants the map for her own reasons. So, now, Puss, Kitty, Big Jack, Goldi and the Bear syndicate all want the precious map. There is one problem: depending on the viewer, the map will show a different path to the Wishing Star. All are bad and very dangerous, except for Perro, whom Kitty affectionately names Perrito.
The players in this game all want the wish for selfish reasons so you can guess that good will triumph over bad and a good heart is the best thing ever. There is a lot of mashing up of fairy tales and that keeps the viewer busy in an amusing way.

"Dec 14, 2022"," In terms of recent sequels, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has to be one of the bigger question marks, at least on paper. Following up the 2011 Puss in Boots feature which brought the Antonio Banderas voiced feline to his own story after playing sidekick in the last three Shrek films, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish looked to revive a clearly dead franchise over a decade after its last appearance on the big screen. Faith in the project being one of quality only further became doubtful as DreamWorks slate has been a consistent dud for multiple years, outside of The Bad Guys, and Joel Crawford stepped into the role of director following up his feature directorial debut of The Croods: A New Age. All signs pointed to Puss in Boots: The Last Wish being an utter disaster but in life, miracles sometimes do happen. Rather than feeling cheap or forced, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish sticks the landing with elegance turning out one of the best animated features of the year. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows suit on the previous Puss in Boots feature with a wildly compelling story that contains strong emotional arcs and genuine thrills. The backbone of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an examination of the fear of death: Puss in Boots, once again voiced by Antonio Banderas, finds himself on the last of his nine lives. While Puss wants to take this heroically and not change a thing, he is faced with an unrelenting fear that makes him run and hide. This isn't helped by death himself, a wolf voiced by Wagner Moura, being after him. This is a mature and layered character study that is expertly compressed and focused to be digestible for younger audiences while never losing its edge or gravitas. This story itself also embraces incredible creativity and fun. While the overall arc might be somewhat predictable, it isn't hard to imagine the emotional journey the scruffy, selfish, and scared protagonist is going to go on, the film does anything but go through the motions. The world of Puss in Boots gets expanded with new locations and characters that are well thought out and developed. Part of Puss in Boots' quest for a magical star that can grant wishes sees him use a map that quite literally transforms the path towards the star based on whoever last touches the map. This is such a clever way not only for dynamic world-building and exciting obstacles, but it also works as a means of character exploration and development.  Also looking for the map are Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo), and ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney). Each of these characters is given captivating reasons why they would want the star and each story gives a meaningful addition to the overall emotional weight of the story. This is the creativity that made the first couple of Shrek films so imaginative and iconic and seeing this inspired take on what animated features can be is once again refreshing. Rounding out the strong cast is Harvey Guillén as a notably strong sidekick companion for Puss and Wagner Moura who possibly steals the show with his haunting outing as death. This inspired effort continues into the animation, which clearly takes inspiration from the work of 2018's Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish creates a similar style that plays around with the visual medium of animation with strong uses of experimentation with things like frame rate and color. In a time where so many major studio animated releases are embracing a generic and clean visual style that simply tries to recreate the real world, it is incredibly refreshing to see something with style and personality that isn't afraid to take risks and make bold moves. Between this film and The Bad Guys, this is a lovely direction to see DreamWorks take that is sure to pay off in the long run as these films carry all the elements needed to be new modern animated classics. These elements come together to create a standout feature that is not only fun to watch, but is genuinely moving and meaningful. This is incredibly promising as it is clear this world is one that will be back on the big screen before too long. With an almost Avengers-style ending that sees a clear tease for the next installment in the Shrek franchise, the meaning of Puss in Boots: The Last Wish's success becomes all the more massive. This film was a trial run to see where this universe could go and what identity it can craft for itself with the results being beyond promising. If the studio embraces what makes this film so special, a possible DreamWorks renaissance could genuinely be on the horizon.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is something of a miracle. The film is an inspired and worthy sequel that immediately outshines nearly every other animated feature to come out this year. The film carries an effortless charisma while also bringing to life a true darkness that never loses its place or purpose. This is a sign of tremendous craft behind the scenes that really delivers and creates a final picture that is beyond easy to recommend. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 14, 2022"," While Avatar: The Way of Water is dominating theaters this weekend, I didn’t want to leave out thoughts on these smaller and streaming releases before the end of 2022. This set of write-ups includes a gothic drama, an animated fairy tale adventure, a stylish semi-autobiography, a unique Polish drama, a South Korean drama, a Norwegian kaiju flick, a documentary about 70s Black cinema, a documentary about Robert Downey, Sr., an indie comedy about Indian Americans, and a Christmas-set legacy sequel. The following features reviews for The Eternal Daughter, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, Bardo, False Chronicle of a Handful of Truths, EO, Return to Seoul, Troll, Is That Black Enough For You?!?, “Sr.”, Four Samosas, and A Christmas Story Christmas. The Setup: An artist and her elderly mother (both played by Tilda Swinton) confront long-buried secrets when they return to a former family home, now a hotel haunted by its mysterious past. Review: Sometimes, you just find yourself entirely in sync with how a movie has chosen to present itself. Director Joanna Hogg recently delivered a two-parter of semi-autobiographical stories with The Souvenir films and has returned with an ingenious follow-up that serves as a sort of haunted dream sequel featuring Julie and Rosalind once again. With that in mind, there’s no need to see other films for this to work. The Eternal Daughter is great as a gothic horror film that focuses more on being methodical and moody, as opposed to outright scaring anyone. In dual roles, Swinton delivers as incredibly well as one would expect, but Hogg’s work to evoke creepy films of the 60s and 70s pays off in clever ways. With some sly humor, deliberate choices in the performances, and some elements of subversion, here’s a film that finds unique ways to delve into the nature of parental relationships and how to find closure. It won’t be for everyone, but this story haunts the appreciative viewer in the right ways. The Setup: The daring outlaw Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send the swashbuckling feline on his grandest quest yet. Review: Much like the other very entertaining DreamWorks Animation film from this year, The Bad Guys, I’m delighted to see this Puss in Boots sequel taking a cue from Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, and daring to do more than just the same ol’ thing when it comes to the animation style. It helps that relying on a look that resembles storybook illustrations is entirely fitting for a character that exists in a fairytale universe. This allows for a feature bursting with life and energy as we watch Puss in Boots, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and Perrito (Harvey Guillen) engage with an adventure with more edge than one may expect. Being literally on the run from Death (a sinister Wagner Moura), Puss in Boots’ new introspection makes it feel like we are watching Banderas deliver a performance in an animated version of Pedro Almodóvar’s Pain & Glory. This may not lead to another Oscar nomination for the Spanish star, but it provides more exciting ideas for a Puss in Boots sequel to deal with than anyone may have initially expected. It also places this movie high in the realm of quality Shrek sequels/spin-offs. The Setup: A renowned Mexican journalist and documentary filmmaker, Silverio Gama (Daniel Giménez Cacho), returns home and works through an existential crisis as he grapples with his identity, familial relationships, and the folly of his memories. Review: Portions of Bardo are quite wrenching as Silverio comes to terms with tragedy befalling him and his wife. Other areas have fun playing as a satirical look at fame, sticking presumably close to director Alejandro G. Iñárritu’s regard for himself. And then there are the moments that delve into the surreal as we watch Silverio’s day-to-day life play out in offbeat ways. It’s perhaps these portions where the film feels the most engaging, yet Bardo has a serious lack of urgency for a 140-minute feature. There’s so much movie on display thanks to the efforts put in by Iñárritu, Cacho, and cinematographer Darius Khondji. Yet, I always felt I was being held at arm’s length. As an Oscar-winning director (scoring two in a row for Birdman and The Revenant), the idea that, at its core, this feels like a dark joke about a director lamenting being too great at his profession while drama surrounds him, means Iñárritu is not above poking fun at self-indulgent exercises. That said, perhaps there’s too much of the idea becoming a reality. The Setup: The world is a mysterious place when seen through the eyes of an animal. EO, a grey donkey with melancholic eyes, meets good and bad people on his life’s path, experiences joy and pain, and endures the wheel of fortune randomly turn his luck into disaster and his despair into unexpected bliss. But not even for a moment does he lose his innocence. Review: To be honest, I went into this movie thinking I was going to get a documentary on the treatment of Donkeys in some part of the world. I was not expecting a gloriously minimalist film attempting to evoke the days of Robert Bresson. Yes, Jerzy Skolimowski’s EO is like watching Pickpocket but with a Donkey, and it’s terrific. As we follow the life of a donkey born in a Polish circus, there’s a steady hand at play when it comes to seeing his journey around the country. We meet various individuals with their own stories, leading to interesting tonal shifts, stylish choices (this is an incredibly well-shot movie), and some pushes into emotional territory that pack more punch than many of the acclaimed dramas I’ve seen this year. The message one takes away about humanity is not necessarily unexpected, but at least the charm of seeing it through this Equidae perspective keeps the film from wearing out its welcome. The Setup: On an impulse to reconnect with her origins, Freddie (Ji-Min Park), 25, returns to South Korea for the first time, where she was born before being adopted and raised in France. The headstrong young woman starts looking for her biological parents in a country she knows so little about, taking her life in new and unexpected directions. Review: No one truly understands who they are without experiencing the real world around them. This can be even more of the case for someone like Freddie, whose sudden push to head to South Korea and find information on her birth parents takes her down an intriguing path of self-discovery. For a debut performance, Park is terrific here, rivaling some of the more exalted performances I’ve seen this year. This is a movie entirely under her control when it comes to seeing how director/writer Davy Chou has sudden shifts in gear as far as tone and even the music being heard. For a film filled with so much anxiety, there’s a bit of a wild streak held within as well, allowing for a character who could easily become unlikable at any second to use her restless nature as a way to keep pushing the narrative in unpredictable directions. The resulting film is a satisfying take on how a damaged soul progresses, with various supporting elements to make it all the more compelling, including language barriers, some uneasy humor, and other factors in one assured feature. The Setup: Deep inside the mountain of Dovre, something gigantic awakens after being trapped for a thousand years. Destroying everything in its path, the creature is fast approaching the capital of Norway. But how do you stop something you thought only existed in Norwegian folklore? Review: Yes, there was a particular joy that came over me when seeing that director Roar Uthaug would be delivering the Norwegian equivalent of a Godzilla movie. Having done a fine job with his disaster movie The Wave, I was hoping for something solid and came away with something that truly rocks! Troll understands what kind of movie it is and pushes itself in the right direction. A mythical monster has emerged from the very real mountains of Dovre, and we watch the government attempt to figure it out. There are some standout scientist, political, and military characters who do what’s needed to make their mark, but this is a movie primarily focused on providing setups for and delivering wild action sequences involving this gigantic troll. Uthaug seems to have learned the proper lessons from King Kong and Godzilla, as it builds tension well, supplies strong enough effects, and never leans too hard into camp or sincerity. There’s a deeply silly movie at the core of this thing, but it’s handled with the right kind of energy, making it all very fun. The Setup: The documentary examines the craft and power of cinema from a perspective often overlooked: the African American contribution to films released from the landmark era of the 70s. It is a deep dive into the impact that point of view had on movies and popular culture. Crucial artistic voices, including director Charles Burnett, Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Laurence Fishburne, Zendaya, and others, artists offer their distinctive prism on the creators and films that dazzled and inspired, providing insight into the history of Black representation going back to the earliest days of cinema, and the cultural impact of witnessing unapologetic Blackness. Review: Film critic, interviewer, and historian Elvis Mitchell has created an excellent documentary here. As the summary suggests, there is plenty for this film to delve into, which is why it’s 135 minutes. Yet, every part has some level of intrigue, as Black film in the 70s had to compete with so much, despite leaving an impact in at least some parts of America and beyond. With that in mind, while there’s plenty of value in just coming to understand the point of views of the many speakers presented here, let alone take away many great recommendations for films to catch up on (people should seek out Cooley High at the very least), it’s Mitchell who may be contributing the most important aspect of this doc. Without overplaying it, Mitchell’s narration is playing off his own memories, clear observations, and a level of contempt for the way Hollywood treated Black cinema. Given the themes and stories shared by many of these films, it’s no surprise that this documentary matches them up against the times and what it’s like being Black in America. The fact that this still works as a terrifically entertaining look at one crucial part of film history makes it plenty worthwhile. The Setup: Robert Downey Jr. pays tribute to his late father in this documentary chronicling the life and eclectic career of pioneering filmmaker Robert Downey Sr. Review: I didn’t necessarily expect not to get anything out of “Sr.” as director Chris Smith always has my attention following his fantastic 1999 documentary, American Movie. With that said, even with Robert Downey Jr. driving so much of what we are seeing forward, there’s a great tenderness to what he wants to accomplish by providing this poignant tribute to his father, the titular “Sr.” There are enjoyable elements to be found when the film simply seek to present these two, along with the even younger Downey children, bonding over what it means to be a father who has lived a challenging life in Hollywood. However, when the film looks at Sr.’s perspective, be it the information we receive about his younger days as an ambitious filmmaker or the periods in this doc where we see Sr.’s own take on how he would edit this all together, that’s when the movie truly shines. Being made by RDJ with a certain finality in mind, there’s undoubtedly something cathartic about seeing the point of view of a person who had to work hard to get his life on track showing one of his most important relationships play out to a natural conclusion. One only wonders if having cameras nearby makes us too much of a voyeur in those final stretches. The Setup: When a wanna-be rapper (Venk Potula) learns his ex is engaged to marry his smarmy rival (Karan Soni), he and three other misfit dreamers plan a heist to steal her wedding diamonds and win her back in this quirky caper. Review: Perhaps a few more passes on the screenplay could have really made this film a winner, and yet there’s still enough of an endearing spirit on display that made Four Samosas an enjoyable watch. It’s just too darn likable watching an underrepresented Indian cast make their way through a Wes Anderson-lite effort. I’m not sure the visual approach ever feels truly justified beyond director/writer Ravi Kapoor simply wanting to express his appreciation for the acclaimed filmmaker. However, it’s hard to say this feels too intrusive when the plot that unfolds is probably ultimately served better by having a level of style that goes with it. At 80 minutes, it’s a lean enough film that manages to get past having a fairly thin story. Some standout comedic moments do what’s needed to give it some edge, and it even manages to close out on just the right set of beats (in addition to a post-credit scene). Basically, this crew has heart. The Setup: Follows the now-adult Ralphie (Peter Billingsley) as he returns to the house on Cleveland Street to give his kids a magical Christmas like the one he had as a child, reconnecting with childhood friends, and reconciling the passing of his Old Man. Review: Everyone has different holiday favorites when it comes to which movie to watch in December. Some pick up It’s A Wonderful Life, some shoot for Elf, others go for Die Hard, and Scrooges kid themselves into thinking that Die Hard isn’t a Christmas movie and watch whatever, I don’t care. Kidding aside, A Christmas Story is one of those perennial classics in the realm of cable TV favorites that I enjoy very much. The idea of delivering a legacy sequel stood on shaky ground, to say the least, especially after seeing Disney crash and burn with Hocus Pocus 2 and Disenchanted in recent weeks. Fortunately, returning star/producer Peter Billingsley managed to put a good foot forward and deliver a sweet, simple film that does enough to honor the original while carving its own path. It’s no new holiday classic, but as the 8th(!) entry in Jean Shepherd’s Parker Family Saga (he narrated every entry up until his passing in 1999), A Christmas Story Christmas may have a ridiculous title, but it fits in well enough as a continuation of this celebration of family, featuring mild hijinks.",POSITIVE
"Dec 14, 2022"," Fairy-tale feline Puss in Boots continues his swashbuckling antics in this lively animated adventure that sees him encounter a menagerie of new adversaries in his quest to find the magical Wishing Star. Antonio Banderas once again voices the “macho catto”, imbuing the character with the smouldering Latin charm of legendary outlaw Zorro. Salma Hayek also returns as love interest Kitty Softpaws, while new additions to the film’s raucous voice cast include Florence Pugh, Harvey Guillén, Olivia Colman and John Mulaney. Having gone toe-to-toe with one deadly monster too many, he discovers to his horror that he has used up eight of his nine lives and faces the very real prospect of imminent death. Any hopes of retirement are soon dashed, however, when he meets Goldilocks (Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family, who inadvertently reveal the existence of the Wishing Star. With a bug-eyed, nameless dog (Guillén) as his sidekick, Puss sets off on a quest to beat Goldi to this mysterious treasure, and use it to restore his spent lives. Along the way, Puss crosses paths with his former flame Kitty, the mysterious Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), and evil “Big” Jack Horner (Mulaney), all of whom have a similar agenda. Arriving more than a decade after Puss in Boots’ first solo outing, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish might seem like something of an afterthought, although work on the project has been feverish during this extended hiatus. As with the Shrek films before it, The Last Wish flaunts a vast knowledge of fairy tales and folklore from across Europe, reinterpreting childhood favourite characters into anarchic new creations that propel the proceedings onwards with a palpable air of fun and freshness. The results are endlessly energetic and gleefully chaotic, while the animation employs a voracious visual palette that eschews Shrek’s waxy three-dimensional aesthetic in favour of something far more evocative of storybook illustrations. Hardly one for Straparola purists, perhaps – the Italian writer and collector of short stories wrote about a talking cat much like Charles Perrault’s Puss in Boots – Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is nevertheless a welcome new chapter in the enchanting tales from Far Far Away.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 13, 2022","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is incredibly fun, profoundly emotional, and a fantastic animated blockbuster. DreamWorks implements a style that hasn’t been seen in any of their other productions, breathing new life into the Shrek franchise. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2022"," As Puss in Boots: The Last Wish begins, it’s evident that this movie is aiming for a different vibe compared to not only the first Puss in Boots but the greater Shrek series as a whole.  A visual aesthetic that evokes hand-drawn animation and rapid-fire editing summons memories of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse or fellow 2022 DreamWorks Animation project The Bad Guys rather than Shrek the Third. Even the handful of pop culture references are more specific and idiosyncratic—Nicolas Cage’s take on The Wicker Man, for instance—than the very broad references the original Shrek movies became famous for.  Puss in Boots: The Last Wish isn’t necessarily here to reinvent the wheel, but it does carry an admirable ambitious streak that makes clear its desire to be more than a disposable disc in a DVD box set of Shrek movies. Such audacity ends up working far more often than not, making for a shockingly fun outing. Who knew a Puss in Boots sequel arriving more than a decade after its predecessor would be this enjoyable?  The prologue, which depicts Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) partying and fighting off a moss-covered giant, makes it clear that neither the boisterous nor the warrior sides of the feline swashbuckler have been diluted since we last saw him.  However, this would-be feat of derring-do ends with Puss getting crushed by a bell, a development that leaves him dead. Upon a trip to the doctor, the furry protagonist is reminded that, like all cats, he’s got nine lives, but after his most recent demise, he’s only got one left. Suddenly, a cat that had previously been full of courage is now incredibly conscious of his vulnerability.  After this, Puss gives up his vigilante ways and resigns himself to being an ordinary housecat. However, the discovery of a magical wishing star gives him renewed hope that he can wish for more lives and get himself back on his feet, er, paws. Of course, Puss isn’t the only one looking for this star. Competing parties include former lover Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), crime boss Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears she calls family, and the malicious “Big” Jack Horner (John Mulaney). The original Shrek movies weren’t devoid of slower or sad moments, as anyone of a certain age who was introduced to Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” by a mournful ogre could tell you. But Puss in Boots: The Last Wish admirably differentiates itself from its predecessors by delving deeper into pathos. Its emotional beats are based on grappling with existentialism and the looming presence of death. There’s an especially interesting tinge of darkness to the scenes involving Puss’ interactions with an ominous figure known as the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura). Their exchange in a bar echoes not the sappiness of Shrek Forever After but quietly eerie sequences involving Ray Wise in the third season of Fargo.  This willingness to go a little deeper into Puss’s existential crisis makes for the best moments in  Paul Fisher and Tommy Sewerdlow’s screenplay, such as Puss having a panic attack while fighting adversaries. This detail also opens up the door for The Last Wish to embrace the darkness in other key aspects of its story, such as its comedy. There are a lot more disposable goons unceremoniously dying than you might expect, often to visually amusing effect (one poor henchman gets reduced right to a skeleton, for instance), while the backstory for comic sidekick Perrito (Harvey Guillén) rides a fine line between bleak and darkly humorous.  Bright colors may fill the screen, but there’s a consistent ominous aura throughout The Last Wish, even in its silliest scenes.  The fluidity and cartoonishness of its images make Puss in Boots: The Last Wish an extremely engaging enterprise visually, particularly when it leans into invoking the feel and appearance of hand-drawn artwork. If there’s any downside to the animation, it’s that the budget-conscious nature of this production is distractingly apparent in the appearances of certain textures like human skin or animal fur. Even if it’s not as flawless looking as Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, though (a high bar to clear), The Last Wish is still commendable for charting out a unique visual aesthetic within the Shrek series.  The animation is overseen by director Joel Crawford, a DreamWorks Animation veteran who previously helmed The Croods: A New Age. His filmmaking sometimes struggles to properly balance the over-the-top comedic aspects of the feature (namely the abrasive comedy of “Big” Jack Horner) with its darker elements. For the most part, though, he’s got a solid grasp over the simultaneously wacky and existential picture. It’s especially—and quietly—impressive that Crawford makes this version of Puss consistent with the multiple prior appearances of the character without jeopardizing his unique vision for The Last Wish.  That vision offers excitement to keep children entertained without condescending to them about heavy matters like death. Kids’ entertainment isn’t just a babysitting tool, it can also introduce youngsters to very weighty concepts. It’s a welcome sight to see Crawford and company realize that truism, especially on a project that could’ve just been a hollow cash grab. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish didn’t need to be this fun or visually stimulating. Thank goodness it is—the result is the cat’s pajamas. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2022"," LOS ANGELES, Dec. 11 (UPI) -- Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, in theaters Dec. 21, is a family fairy tale treat for the holidays. The film pushes animation further and has clever new takes on storybook characters for both kids and adults. But, word of a Wishing Star with one last wish to give calls Puss back into action in the hopes he can wish for another nine lives. Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) returns for this adventure and they meet many new characters along the way. Puss in Boots isn't limited to the Grimm fairy tales that inspired Shrek. Not only does it incorporate Mother Goose characters too, but also Easter eggs from Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum and more. Puss himself dates back earlier than the Brothers Grimm, though they did include him in their stories too. Modern pop culture is also fair game, and a certain niche of movie buffs will appreciate a particular Nicolas Cage movie reference. Jack makes irreverent jokes about his villainy. After centuries of children's stories, let alone decades of family movies, a villain can't very well behave one-dimensionally without at least commenting on it. Puss and Kitty also let a dog, Perrito (Harvey Guillen), tag along. Perrito's endless optimism in the face of adversity makes him endearing to both the audience and his animated companions. The Last Wish has a good message, though. Each character's wish reveals what they think they're lacking, and it's clear to the viewer granting that wish won't solve their problem. The animation draws inspiration from Japanese anime and stop motion aesthetics in the action scenes. The camera whirls around the action ambitiously, but never too frenetically. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a top three entry in the Shrekverse. It may not top the first two Shreks but it's got a lot more to offer than some of the other sequels and spinoffs.

"Dec 11, 2022"," One of the most sincere and philosophical films of 2022 won’t be found in the small Arthouse theater shaded in the cobbled lane behind the busier multiplex but in the V Junior theater at the main movie hub. Like its predecessor and parent series, Shrek spin-off Puss in Boots : the Last Wish fabulously sends up classic fairy tale characters (they’ve a hilariously delightful twist on Little Jack Horner here!), while both introducing and reintroducing audiences to the cutest and most enjoyable of animated characters. But the deep, somewhat serious, and profound human story at its core will likely come as a pleasant surprise to both fans and the fussy. This time, fearless feline Puss in Boots (voiced with glee by Antonio Banderas, again having fun riffing on his classic sex symbol image and iconic turn as Zorro), sets out to find a spiritual last wish, which he’ll use to restore the eight of the nine lives he’s used up over the years. With the assistance of new friend, puppy Perrito (Harvey Guillén), and former lover Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), he’ll daringly evade villains such as criminal kingpin ‘Big’ Jack Horner (John Mulaney), Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears Crime Family (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Samson Kayo), and a mysterious big bad wolf (Wagner Moura) on his road to restoration – or, perhaps, a revelation. Directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado’s decade-gestating sequel to a fun but fairly forgettable Shrek spin-off (2011) gallops in from left field, striking home with a rich, superbly human tale of affirmation cleverly disguised by a comical and cutesy ‘toon movie stencil.   It’s a beautiful pic – aesthetically speaking, too- that reminds us to make the most of the one life we have because, as the movie gods remind us here,  it’s way too short.",POSITIVE
"Dec 9, 2022"," The story: In this sequel to Puss In Boots (2011), Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) discovers to his horror that he is on his final life, having wasted the previous eight on reckless adventures. The terrified feline becomes a house cat and discovers the existence of the Wishing Star, a magical object that can give him all his lives back. He is joined by his nemesis and romantic partner Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and a cheerful new friend, a dog named Perro (Harvey Guillen). A sinister wolf, whom Puss suspects is a bounty hunter, is on his trail.  One reason was that unlike the other fairy-tale characters that populate the Shrek universe, the cat was instantly relatable. He was a parody of the Mexican swashbuckler Zorro, played by Banderas in the 1998 film and who would go on to be the voice of Puss. If DreamWorks Animation had produced a sequel with more of the same Latin lover and thief with a heart of gold template, it would have made for a bankable if predictable film.  To its credit, the studio pushed the boat out just far enough on this project. Puss is gripped by the fear of death, which is integrated into the story in a way that is thoughtful and touching – without it making the whole affair too gloomy. Puss’ over-the-top nature is nicely balanced by the sincerity of supporting characters. They include Kitty Softpaws (Hayek is also reprising her role), but her position as the foil may have been usurped by Perro. Perro is adorable in the way that awesomely stupid but well-intentioned dogs can be. In the social media age, he is the pet that gets on TikTok or Twitter because it is determined to carry a stick horizontally through a doorway too narrow for it, and keeps at it – over and over – patiently.  American actor Guillen, best known for his supporting role on the vampire sitcom What We Do In The Shadows (2019 to present), gives Perro a heart to match the hole in his head.",POSITIVE

"Dec 6, 2022","  It would be fair to say that DreamWorks Animation is not the juggernaut that it used to be. From the early 2000s up until the early 2010s, the animation studio has given audiences true classics in the medium including the first two Shrek films, the Kung Fu Panda and How To Train Your Dragon trilogies, the Madagascar franchise, and Rise of the Guardians. While at the time it may not have had the same batting average as its main competitor Pixar, they were still a name that families could trust in providing entertainment suited for people of all ages. Unfortunately in recent years, they've been slipping. While there are still a few gems in the rough, they also gave us The Boss Baby films. It's been 11 years since the first Puss in Boots was released in theaters and since then, the Shrek franchise has had a bit of a resurgence to say the least, not through film, but through countless internet memes, to the point where it's puzzling that DreamWorks has yet to revisit the fairy tale land of Far, Far, Away. That is until now, with the long-awaited sequel Puss in Boots: The Last Wish featuring the return of the sword-wielding Spanish cat voiced by Antonio Banderas.   The film starts off several years after the events of the previous film, where we find Puss in Boots in the middle of an existential crisis upon learning that he's down to the last of his nine lives. Stalked by the seemingly supernatural Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), for the first time in his life, Puss in Boots isn't the one who is feared but now is in fear of death itself. Defeated, Puss moves in with Mama Luna (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), an old woman who houses dozens of stray cats. Forced to live like an actual cat, Puss meets Perro (Harvey Guillén), a scrappy little dog clad in a sock sweater who has been living unwanted with the rats underneath Mama Luna's home. When a bounty is placed on Puss, several sinister forces chase after him, including Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo), and ""Big"" Jack Horner (John Mulaney). To make matters even more complicated, Puss reunites with his former flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), whom he's become estranged since the events of the last film. After learning of a shooting star that has the ability to grant him additional lives, Puss, Kitty, and Perro embark on a wild adventure to get to the star before their adversaries get to it first.   For a sequel that's taken over a decade to finally hit the screen, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish may have been the hero that DreamWorks Animation has needed all along. Much like the studio's previous film The Bad Guys, the animation style has its own unique style and a personality of its own. Much like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, The Last Wish combines 2D hand-drawn stylings with CG animation to great success. The action is exciting and allows filmmakers Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado as well as the animation team to get creative; at times it plays out like a comic book, there's a scene that feels like a rainbow-coated homage to Mad Max, and plenty of visual gags that'll have the older audiences cracking up right alongside the younger viewers. The landscapes are gorgeous and there's never a dull frame in the film's 100-minute runtime.   Banderas is better than ever voicing Puss, as he brings new layers to the character as he faces a more existentialist dilemma than he has before. The new additions, including Goldilocks, Jack Horner, and the Big Bad Wolf, are all wonderful as well, with Pugh, Mulaney, and Moura bringing their own signature personalities to the roles. It's Guillén's voice work as Perro that is the real stand-out of the cast, a character that gives the film an extra spoonful of heart and is destined to become you and your kids' new favorite character. Perro fits right in with the rest of the characters and Guillén's voice work is responsible for some of the film's funniest moments. He's one of the best sidekicks DreamWorks has given us who fits right alongside Donkey and the Madagascar penguins.   The film is surprisingly much more ambitious and mature than one might expect, it goes beyond the messages you might expect from your average family movie and decides to dig deep into themes of mortality and confronting death. The stakes are actually felt and there are moments in the film's climax that are effectively tense, while the general story may be a predictable one, the places it goes to while telling it almost seem like its targeting the adults or those who grew up with the Shrek films rather than the younger fans who weren't even born when the previous film hit the big screen. The jokes are plentiful, and it's one of the funniest movies of the year, but it is the strong emotional core that holds the movie together. In a time when many sequels fail to live up to their potential by just attempting to recreate what their predecessors did so well, The Last Wish aims to do something different and one that shows a hopeful future for DreamWorks. There's even more than meets the eye with several of the film's antagonists, including Goldilocks' relationship with her makeshift family and the Big Bad Wolf's connection to Puss. While Jack Horner may be the more conventional villain, the others aren't necessarily portrayed as truly ""bad"" people, but the film portrays them in a way where we understand their motivations and even, in some cases, care for them just as much as we do for the central trio.   There are times when The Last Wish may feel a little bit too crowded, the cast of characters is as impressive as it is vast, but Paul Fisher's script does an effective job of preventing the movie from ever feeling too overwhelming or convoluted.   Nothing in Puss in Boots: The Last Wish feels lazy, it more than justifies the long wait. It is not only one of the best animated films of the year, but it's one of DreamWorks' best, and one that will strike a chord with moviegoers of all ages. It's equal parts exciting and hilarious as well as earnest, it never feels like it is talking down to anyone. With The Bad Guys and now Puss in Boots: The Last Wish it is more than safe to say that DreamWorks is back and (maybe) better than ever.

"Dec 2, 2022"," Puss in Boots has always been a bit of an outsider in the Shrek movies; darker, more serious, but still fitting with the goofy tone of the films when needed. The first solo Puss in Boots movie felt like a breath of fresh air, a proper adventure rather than just a pastiche, and now, over a decade later, Puss in Boots returns once again to breathe new life into the Shrek franchise with one of the best animated movies of the year. There are pop culture references and needle drops, but they are in service of a rather mature and complex story about facing death and embracing life as it follows an adventurer at the tail end of his life. Make no mistake, this is the Logan of the Shrek franchise we didn't know we needed. After countless death-defying stunts and adventures, Puss in Boots is at the top of his game. The cat feels invincible and constantly brags about his exploits in song, and puts himself in unnecessary danger — that is, until he discovers he's on his last life and it can all end at any moment. Worse yet, he's being chased by death incarnate, Big Bad Wolf (a fantastic and terrifying Wagner Moura). His only salvation? A mythical wishing star that can grant him his lives back, if he gets to it before a collection of fairy tale characters beats him to the treasure. Like Logan, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is heavily inspired by westerns in its depiction of an old cowboy confronting his own mortality after a lifetime of great tales and adventures. From the vast plains, the use of Spanish in both music and dialogue — with the film putting its Hispanic cast to great use, adding to the authenticity — you can easily replace Puss' sword for a gun, and his cape for a poncho and think it's a kids' version of Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Name. It’s one of the darkest and most mature movies DreamWorks Animation has done in years, with themes about confronting death and reckoning with some hard truths — like the fact that people you love can betray you, and that you can end up alone. But it’s not all doom and gloom, as the story comes off as rather life-affirming with an uplifting message about embracing every day like it's your last. The Logan comparison is not just in tone, but in action too, as Puss in Boots: The Last Wish has some of the best action you’ll see in a Western-animated film. The camera movement is dynamic, unafraid to shift to inventive positions or give us unusual angles to place us right in the middle of the action, which at times feels like a big-budget anime. The film even plays with frame rate like Into the Spider-Verse did, shifting between 24 and 12 frames depending on Puss' confidence. In the first action scene in the movie, where Puss fights a stone giant, the animation is fluid and fast paced, as Puss feels invincible. Later, when fighting Big Bad Wolf, he is animated on twos (12 frames per second), slowing down, losing his confidence, realizing he can be beaten. Also like Into the Spider-Verse, The Last Wish is a technicolor marvel, using a painterly style to give the film a fairy tale look. It’s also a rare American studio-animated film where the stakes feel real. Any time Moura's Big Bad Wolf is on screen, you feel the tension thanks to his blood-red eyes, his ominous whistling, and black robe. He is truly death incarnate, and he is scary. Granted, this is still a DreamWorks movie, so there's still a lot of jokes. Thankfully, it never pulls a Shrek 2 with a montage of movie references that were already a few years old by the time of release. Instead, The Last Wish has a few contemporary references — a kid rejoicing that Puss stepped on his face — while most are just timeless gags and jokes, most of them involving Harvey Guillén's Perrito, the true star of the film. If you're expecting more Shrek-like humor, you might be disappointed. But if you recognize that hearing Antonio Banderas deliver his own eulogy with no one else around him sounds rather hysterical, this is the movie for you. Speaking of the cast, Western studio-animated movies tend to focus a lot on big-name actors that sound more like, well, the actors themselves than the characters they’re playing. Here, however, the cast doesn't distract from the story, but adds to it. From Wagner to Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, and even John Mulaney — arguably the most recognizable voice of the bunch — they work in the context of the story and justify their A-list casting. In true Shrek fashion, they play fairy tale characters you may recognize, but in uniquely twisted ways, with the best one being a small role for The Talking Cricket from Pinocchio, who tries to be the bad guy's conscience but fails miserably at convincing him to not just murder people. With gorgeous visuals that pop out of the screen, animation that blends 3D and 2D in exhilarating ways to deliver thrilling action scenes, and a poignant yet life-affirming story, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is one of the best animated movies of the year, and a great return to form for the franchise. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish takes not only the Shrek franchise, but DreamWorks Animation to exciting new places. This is a spaghetti western-inspired tale of an aging cowboy on one last adventure with some rather mature themes, aided by stunning animation that mixes 3D with 2D effects, and a painterly style that gives the film a unique look.",POSITIVE
"Dec 2, 2022"," Going into 2022 I can tell you one thing- I did not expect to prefer both DreamWorks films over both Pixar (and Disney) films and to be crowning one of them as my favorite movie of 2022…and yet here we are. Even more surprising is that film, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a sequel in a franchise that has well exceeded its welcome. This is why I always go into a movie hoping to be dazzled with what the filmmakers have to offer. Wow, this made your fave film of 2022?! I wasn’t expecting much from this sequel, but if it’s even better than The Bad Guys, I’m super excited to check this out! I really agree that DreamWorks hit it out of the park this year, delivering two very strong films which I don’t think even Pixar ever managed. Granted I don’t think this is a complete masterpiece, and my mom and sister who saw it with me didn’t seem to regard it as anything other than a cash-grab or quick entertainment, but that disappoints me, because this honestly did a great job concluding Puss’s storyline. He didn’t seem to be a character who needed his own film, but since he got one (and that one was perfectly nice and decent in its own right), this serves to bring the franchise full circle. And I really have to give the film credit for being brave enough to give us the ending it did. It’s so easy to give a protagonist everything the audience could want them to have, but the filmmakers have my undying respect for remembering that if you try sometimes, you just might find….. My only real issues are that the action can be too kinetic and I would have preferred more character development. But what we do get is more than most people probably even imagined a Puss in Boots movie would give us, and the last half hour is so flat-out flawless in its climax that anything that came before is almost completely forgotten. The ending of this film is a masterpiece, and if everything leading up to it can’t truthfully be said to be on that same level, you have to wonder how anything could be.",POSITIVE
"Nov 29, 2022"," Directed by Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado.
Featuring the voice talents of Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek Pinault, Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Wagner Moura, John Mulaney, Harvey Guillén, Samson Kayo, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Anthony Mendez, and Conrad Vernon. Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for adventure has taken its toll: he has burned through eight of his nine lives. Puss sets out on an epic journey to find the mythical Last Wish and restore his nine lives. Legend has it that all cats have nine lives. Co-directors Joel Crawford and Januel Mercado (with a script from Paul Fisher) have seen fit to catch up with the bounty hunter-turned-adventurer Puss (once again voiced by Antonio Banderas, essentially playing a heightened and animated version of his roguish and romantic on-screen persona) for a surprisingly thoughtful and existential riff on that concept with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.  After causing a fuss at a governor’s party while, in the process, defeating an awakened nearby angry giant, Puss meets his demise for what turns out to be the eighth time. As the doctor stresses to Puss that he’s down to his last life (there is also a pleasantly silly montage depicting how he lost each of those lives), it’s advised that it might be time to give up treasure hunting, sword fighting, and swashbuckling for good, even if it means becoming something he despises: a house pet. Taking the words to heart, Puss buries his trademark gear while checking himself into a home for cats run by well, a crazy cat lady (voiced by Da’Vine Joy Randolph). Meanwhile, the various fairytale animals that have inhabited this Shrek universe throughout the years, specifically some new ones here in the form of Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh, who has found another calling in her already stellar career) and the family of three bears (Olivia Colman voices Mama Bear, Ray Winstone voices Papa Bear, and Samson Kayo voices Baby Bear) searching for a mythical Wishing Star capable of granting any wish one time. The bears are her muscle, so to speak, under the impression that the wish will be made for the four of them to run a family business. Then there is Big Jack Horner (voiced by John Mulaney), a truly lost cause that wants to wish for sole possession of all the magic in the world. He carries with him a bottomless bag of fairytale resources for his quest, at one point unintentionally bringing out everyone’s favorite conscience-guiding cricket who amusingly tries over and over to reach an emotional breakthrough with the humongous bully, hoping to find some humanity or reason for his evil ways, coming away empty-handed and less patient every time. It’s a welcome running gag that taps into what has always been one of the better aspects of these Shrek universe movies: finding absurd uses for the fairytale characters. As Puss tries adapting to domestic advice (growing a long beard in the process), he also meets a tiny orphaned dog posing as a cat for a place to stay. Nicknamed Perro and voiced by Harvey Guillén, the hyperactive dog is filled with naivety and innocence, simply seeking a friend. Following an interaction with Puss and Goldilocks, where the former learns of the Wishing Star and that he would be able to wish for his lives back, it quickly becomes time for another adventure, this time bringing along Perro. Along the way, they run into Puss’ former flame and partner in crime, Kitty Softpaws (voiced by a returning Salma Hayek Pinault), catching up on their history between the years. While this seems like a stacked cast of characters for a brisk, animated flick, the filmmakers are genuinely interested in exploring the nine lives concept, even introducing Death (voiced by Wagner Moura) by way of The Big Bad Wolf, ominously appearing and intimidating whenever Puss finds himself in a physical conflict that could be the last of him for good. His life flashes before his eyes, further tapping into something self-reflexive about a life lived, whether or not it has been fulfilling, what really matters, and how to go about the future. The connection that many of these characters are orphans is also not lost on the script, with many craving more than necessary to be happy (Perro is happy enough to have friends, while Goldilocks’ subplot is also unexpectedly moving). Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is also vibrant fun, frequently switching up animation styles (the action sequences almost play out like comic book strips) with impressive visuals, including a forest that transforms itself into something brighter and safer or darker and perilous based on who is holding the magical map and the decisions they have made in life. There’s also a tremendously catchy opening musical number to set the stage that, as thematically weightier as this is for an animated feature, the filmmakers are also here to deliver 100 minutes of dazzling joy. Bolstered by a magnificent ensemble allowing his characters to pop off the screen with personality, they have succeeded. It’s a sequel that has those irresistible sympathetic huge cat eyes; you can’t help but be won over by it.",POSITIVE
"Nov 29, 2022"," It’s been 18 years since Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots first flashed his huge eyes onscreen in box office smash and Cannes in-competition film Shrek 2. Though the Shrek franchise faded with each half-baked sequel, Puss in Boots got the origin story treatment in a 2011 installment. A decade later you'd assume that this Puss in Boots: The Last Wish would feel stale and dated. Instead it's a charming winner filled with imagination and fun! The story is a familiar one, centering around wish fulfillment and a grand race. Yet, there is plenty of juice left in this fairy tale world. The film blends childlike mania with poignant themes of belonging to make this perfect programming for families looking for a movie this holiday season. When we catch up with Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), he’s leading a sing-a-long about his prowess while getting in a fight with both a town and a giant... Puss reunites with an old flame, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and gains a new sidekick, Perro (Harvey Guillen).However, the ominous Big Bad Wolf (hauntingly voiced by Wagner Moura), catches up with Puss and informs him that he is on his last life and there is a heavy bounty on his head. Puss decides to hang up his hat as a renegade and settle down as a house cat in Mama Luna’s (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) cat-filled home. Effectively in retirement, Puss befriends Perro (Harvey Guillen) a joyfully dim dog masquerading as a cat. Perro emerges as the standout character of this entry, a lovable and loyal companion who’s a heartfelt foil to Puss’ debonair bravado. Puss’ life of complacency is disrupted when a “wishing star” who could restore our hero's nine lives crash lands in the Black Forest. To reach the star, he'll have to team up with his former scorned lover, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek, always a joy). Goldilocks and the Three Bears steal the show as a menacing family out to make a wish on the wishing star.Puss, Kitty and Perro aren’t the only people after the wishing star. Some of the most delightful moments come from an Essex-accented Goldilocks and her family of Three Bears. They’ve been in search of the wishing star for years. Florence Pugh offers a committed vocal performance as this tough-as-nails Goldilocks. The three bears feature deft voive work from Olivia Colman (Mama), Ray Winstone (Papa and Samson Kayo (Baby). They prove more than just comic relief, providing one of the most heartfelt moments of the film. On paper, the big bad is “Big” Jack Horner, voiced with tremendous gusto by John Mulaney. He’s the frightful embodiment of childhood petulance gone unchecked. Now the head of a giant pie conglomerate, Jack wants all of his needs satiated at all times. Thus, he’ll do anything he can to get his hands on the star. There is plenty of visual energy to the latest Puss in Boots film.Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines a zany Rat Race plot with a somber meditation on mortality. In truth the two modes do sometimes feel at odds with one another. Yet all in all this big swing is appreciated, as it adds more depth to the Puss character. How can he feel brave if he has just one life to live? Where does bravery come from? Also, what happens when the one thing that has defined us in life goes away?

"Nov 28, 2022"," It’s been 11 years since the last “Puss in Boots” movie, and 12 years since the last proper installment of the original blockbuster “Shrek” movie franchise. So it makes sense that this new kids movie would want to grow up with its former audience. But “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” may have overshot that mark: The latest fairy-tale comedy adventure is all about how living in an old folks’ home is tragic and depressing and only slightly preferable to our inevitable, terrifying deaths. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” stars Antonio Banderas as the voice of the titular hero, a feline in fabulous footwear who has had an impressive number of daredevil adventures. At the start of the movie he’s usurped a corrupt governor’s mansion for the purposes of a fabulous populist party — the cake-and-streamers kind, not a political one — and then he wages war against, essentially, Grendel from “Beowulf.” It’s a gigantic giant who’s annoyed by all the hubbub and will stop at nothing to shut his noisy neighbors up. Director Joel Crawford (“Croods: The New Age”) uses this action-packed opening to establish that the “Shrek” franchise hasn’t lost its sense of whimsy. The film uses modern animation styles popularized by “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” to give the film a less fluid yet sharper aesthetic whenever the danger sets in. It looks for all the world like “The Last Wish” will, if nothing else, be a hoot and a holler, a barrel full of thrilling, fairy-tale laughs. It’s only temporary of course. Puss in Boots is a cat, and in a fantasy universe, cats have nine lives. But what Puss doesn’t realize until it’s almost too late is that he’s officially on his last life, and his next death will be final. Now he’s being hunted by a mysterious and powerful wolf who wields razor-sharp sickles and may be, and probably is, the literal personification of Death (Wagner Moura, “The Grey Man”). Either way, he’s an unstoppable juggernaut who will not rest until Puss is buried in the ground. He hates every single thing Puss in Boots stands for — a life lived seemingly oblivious to mortality. So Puss does what any hero would do in that situation. He retires immediately and runs away to the cat version of an assisted-living facility, the house of an elderly lady who swiftly reduces Puss’s life into a meaningless purgatory filled with humiliation, shame, overcrowding, and troughs of joyless dry food. There’s a whole big plot to “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” after that, in which a whole bunch of fairy-tale creatures search for the magic wishing star of nursery rhyme legend, which has the power to grant just one last wish. Puss saddles up to get his lives back and teams up with his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and an annoyingly friendly therapy dog (Harvey Guillén, “What We Do in the Shadows”). Also on the hunt are Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and her rough-and-tumble gang-slash-family of bears, and the villainous “Little” — strike that, now he’s “Big” — Jack Horner (John Mulaney), who carries Mary Poppins’ carpetbag, which he’s filled with deadly fairy-tale artifacts. Along the way, most of them learn valuable lessons and endure a wide variety of amusing side quests, but it’s incredibly hard to shake the notion that everything we’re watching is a desperate fantasy, not the fun kind. Puss in Boots isn’t on a rousing adventure; he’s performing the fairy-tale equivalent of grasping at miracle cures while he’s dying from a terminal illness. And although the film is funny in fits and starts, and exciting in fits and starts, the ultimate takeaway is weirdly sobering. It’s an appealingly animated feature film, colorful and sometimes visually innovative. There are gags about fairy tales that range from eye-rolling to genuinely hilarious — the cameo from Jiminy Cricket certainly qualifies among the latter — and there are swashbuckling fight scenes that swash and/or buckle rather well. Surprising no one, Florence Pugh steals many scenes with her badass-yet-soulful rendition of Goldilocks, in which she wasn’t eaten but instead raised by comedy-relief bears (voiced by Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo). Even though she has a loving family, she still feels traumatized by her apparent abandonment, and Pugh plays that up wonderfully. And yet — and yet — when all is said and done, no matter how affirmed everyone’s life is, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” makes its biggest impact by suggesting that all of these delightful fairy-tale creatures in the “Shrek” universe are truly destined to die, genuinely die, and that their deaths might not be heroic or even exciting. Some of them may die sad and lonely, thinking about what could have been. ",NEGATIVE
"Nov 28, 2022"," It has been a long decade since Fiona’s father hired Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) to hunt down our beloved green monster, Shrek. As soon as he jumped out of his famous footwear, sprang those claws, and interrupted his famous catchphrase for a hilarious hairball, the magnetic feline has been a beloved character in animated movies. It’s a wonder why DreamWorks waited so long. After appearing in two Shrek films and the stand-alone spinoff, to greenlight another installment of adorable machismo cuteness. And they accomplish that sentiment with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. An animated film that is a meow-velous delight from start to finish. The Puss in Boots franchise picks up where the feisty feline’s taste for adventure has never died. He had taken over a castle taken up by a man of royal status. (My guess is this was a Frenchman when France colonized Spain in the early 19th century). He steals from the rich and gives back to the poor. Unfortunately, when the royalty wanders home with his pudgy midsection and faux white locks from an exquisitely crafted periwig, Frisky Two Times must run for it. As he does, with more flair than the Nature Boy with his scintillating charango playing, he escapes. All while downing some shots of Leche and saving the town from a tree monster awakened by a series of fireworks set off with a whopping helping of gusto. However, after years of adventures and a passion for life, our Diablo Gato has used up eight of his nine lives during all those epic journeys. Our feline friend refuses to turn in his fine Carinthian leather footwear, put away his rapier, and hang up his cavalier hat. That is until a big, evil wolf bounty hunter (Wagner Moura) shows up. They want to take Puss down, dead or alive. And, he would prefer dead. Frightened for the first time, he takes off searching for the Last Wish, where he can restore his nine lives. Of course, he isn’t the only one searching for this myth in the dark forest. Puss in Boots will run into new foes and old friends and make a loveable new one along with way. And that’s where Joel Crawford‘s (The Crood’s: A New Age) film shines. Besides Banderas’s flawless comedic delivery, you have the return of the world’s most famous Tuxedo cat, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), and their chemistry is terrific. You have classic fairy tale characters given creative spins, for which the Shrek franchise is known. Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh) and the three bears (voiced by an incredible lineup of Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, and Samson Kayo) with selfish intentions, but their story has sweet themes behind them. Then you have the deliciously evil Jack Horner (John Mulaney, overdoing it as only he can). He is now grown up, still sticking his thumb in pies where it doesn’t belong. You even have some fine touches from Paul Fisher’s funny and touching script. For example, the hilarious and scene-stealing “ethical bug,” voiced by Kevin McCann, gives the film an underlying humor that compliments the film perfectly. However, the breakout character is Reacher‘s Harvey Guillen as Perro, a charming and eternal optimist whose primary goal is to become a therapy dog. Guillen makes a character that could have been cliche and tired, fresh and new again. Expect spinoffs, including specials and streaming series, for Perro in the near future. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is an unexpected treat. With an eye-catching and risky choice of combining 2D and 3D animation, this installment of the Stabby Tabby is a serendipitous surprise. And a welcomed one at that. With a combination of meaningful themes and a wonderful sense of humor, this is a perfect family film for parents and little ones over the holidays. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2022"," Culture Representation: Taking place in a fictional world populated by classic fairy-tale characters and original DreamWorks Animation characters, the animated film “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” features a racially diverse voice cast (Latino, white and black) portraying humans and talking animals. Culture Clash: Outlaw pirate cat Puss in Boots goes on a quest with friends and competes with enemies to find a magical Wishing Star that can grant one last wish to whomever gets to the star first. Culture Audience: “Puss in Boots” will appeal primarily to people who are fans of the movie’s voice cast members; the “Puss in Boots” and “Shrek” franchises; and movies that are family-friendly, thrilling stories with a lot of heart. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is a fun-filled adventure packed with comedic moments, poignant life lessons and some wacky surprises. This sequel is an instant classic that charms with a talented voice cast, stunning visuals and a very entertaining story. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is more than a worthy follow-up to 2011’s “Puss in Boots.” “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” could easily be considered one of the best movies from DreamWorks Animation. Directed by Joel Crawford and co-directed by Januel Mercado, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” is the type of sequel where it’s not necessary to see the original movie to understand the story. Most viewers will probably know already that the swashbuckling, outlaw pirate cat known as Puss in Boots (voiced by Antonio Banderas) first made an appearance in 2004’s “Shrek 2” and subsequently appeared in 2007’s “Shrek the Third” and 2010’s “Shrek Forever After.” The first “Puss in Boots” movie was his origin story. Also part of the “Puss in Boots” franchise are the 2012 short film “Puss in Boots: The Three Diablos,” the 2015-2018 Netflix series “The Adventures of Puss in Boots” and the 2017 Netflix interactive special “Puss in Book: Trapped in an Epic Tale.” In “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” Puss goes on a quest to the Black Forest to find a magical Wishing Star that can grant one last wish to anyone who finds the star first. He’s got some help from friends and some competition from enemies. Before he gets to the Black Forest, the movie has a meaningful subplot about Puss facing his own mortality. This character development shows a vulnerable side to Puss, whose swaggering confidence and bravery are tested throughout the story. In the beginning of “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” Puss is his usually lovably arrogant self, and he’s still a fugitive from the law who’s wanted for a bank robbery that he was tricked into committing. (The first “Puss in Boots” movie goes into more details about this robbery.) Puss barrels his way into a foreign land, where he ends up in a palace, and slides down the portrait painting of the ruling governor (voiced by Bernardo De Paula), who watches in horror as Puss’s claws drag through the painting and ruin it. Puss then fights and defeats a tree monster, but Puss is soon knocked unconscious by a giant bell that falls on him. Puss wakes up in the office a man who describe himself as the local medical doctor (voiced by Anthony Mendez), who explains that he also works as a barber, a veterinarian and a witch doctor. The doctor tells Puss that Puss actually died but was able to be revived. The doctor knows that cats have nine lives, so he asks Puss how many lives Puss has used up already. Puss has never really thought about it before, but after some reflection, Puss realizes that he has used eight of his nine lives. After Puss dies in his ninth life, Puss will be dead forever. The doctor gives Puss this advice that Puss doesn’t want to hear: “You need to retire.” The doctor recommends that Puss go to a home of an animal rescuer named Mama Luna (voiced by Da’Vine Joy Randolph), who operates a cat sanctuary out of her house called Mama Luna’s Cat Rescue. Puss refuses to take that advice and quickly leaves the office. The doctor says these parting words to Puss: “Death comes for us all.” While Puss contemplates his next move, he says to himself while he looks in a mirror: “You’re too good-looking to retire.” Puss goes to a saloon to drink some of his sorrows away. And it’s there that he meets a bounty hunter called the Big Bad Wolf, also known as Wolf (voiced by Wagner Moura), who has been looking to capture Puss. And you know what happens next. During their fight, Puss is armed with his trusty fencing sword, while Wolf has two scythes that he uses in each hand. Puss’ life flashes before his eyes during this battle. And for the first time in his life, Puss experiences true fear that makes him temporarily freeze. Puss runs into a room, where Wolf traps him by locking Puss inside the room. However, Puss finds a way to escape. The panic attack that Puss experienced unnerves him so much, he decides to take the doctor’s advice. Puss doesn’t really want to retire, but he’s more afraid of dying in his next fight. Before Puss goes to Mama Luna’s Cat Rescue, he buries his pirate clothes in a shallow grave and gives a mournful retirement speech out loud that no one can hear except Puss. Mama Luna’s Cat Rescue is crowded with dozens of cats that Mama Luna knows is a violation of health code laws. A running joke in Mama Luna’s dialogue is that she’s constantly paranoid about getting in trouble with animal care officials for all the cats that she keeps indoors. Mama Luna is a bachelorette with a big personality, and she seems to run the sanctuary all by herself. She loves her cats and takes good care of them, but she appears dangerously close to being a cat hoarder. Puss, who is naturally a loner, is miserable at this cat sanctuary. He’s bored in his new home and dislikes the communal meals that he is forced to have with the other cats. During Puss’ forlorn “retirement,” the Doors song “This Is the End” (sung by Dan Navarro, a co-writer of the movie’s original songs) plays to comedic effect. Puss soon meets an unlikely friend at this sanctuary: a small, talkative dog disguised as a cat. His name is Perro (voiced by Harvey Guillén), but Puss eventually gives him the nickname Perrito. (In Spanish, the word “perro” means “dog,” and the word “perrito” means “little dog.”) Perrito is humble, very optimistic, and eager to make friends. In other words, he’s almost the complete opposite of Puss. There would be no “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” if Puss stayed at the cat sanctuary for the rest of the movie. His time at Mama Luna’s Cat Rescue comes to an end with the arrival of four home invaders: Goldilocks (voiced by Florence Pugh) and the three Bears: Mama Bear (voiced by Olivia Colman), Papa Bear (voiced by Ray Winstone) and Baby Bear (voiced by Samson Kayo), who has some rivalry going on with Goldilocks, whose nickname is Goldi. Just like in the fairy tale, Goldilocks is a human orphan who has been adopted into this bear family. But unlike the fairy tale, Goldi is now a tough young woman who is in the bounty-hunting business with her bear family. All four of them have tracked Puss to Mama Luna’s Cat Rescue with the intent to capture Puss. During this attempted capture, Puss and Perrito also find out that Goldi and the Three Bears are also looking for the map to the Wishing Star. It’s how Puss and Perrito find out that this Wishing Star will grant one last wish to the first person who finds the star. It doesn’t take a genius to know that Puss now wants to find the Wishing Star too, because his wish is to live forever. Puss and Perrito manage to escape outside from Goldi and the Three Bears. Puss decides he’s coming out of retirement to find the Wishing Star. He gathers his clothes, his sword, and brings Perrito (a willing sidekick) along for this new adventure. Perrito doesn’t have a wish. He’s just happy he’s found a new friend. Along the way, Puss and Perrito find out that another outlaw is in search of the Wishing Star: Jack Horner (voiced by John Mulaney), a wealthy underworld boss who operates in the back of a bakery. Jack hasn’t lost his bratty ways since he was a child known as Little Jack Horner, who famously ruined a pie by sticking his thumb in it. Jack is now a ruthless villain who has several minions helping him find the map to the Wishing Star. Jack’s wish is to become the most powerful person in this fairtyale universe. During the journey that Puss and Perrito take to the Black Forest to find the Wishing Star, Puss unexpectedly reunites with his on-again/off-again love Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek), who reveals that she was hiding in a trunk. Puss and Kitty haven’t seen each other in years. And let’s just say that they have “unfinished business.” Kitty, who is very cynical about many things, prides herself for being just as brave and stubborn as Puss, so naturally this on-again/off-again couple will clash. “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” doesn’t overstuff the movie with too many characters, thereby giving room for the movie to develop all the principal characters in ways that are better than the average animated adventure film. Puss is now prone to having a few panic attacks, which can throw him off his usually fearless game. Kitty struggles with learning to know the difference between being independent and being mistrustful. The relationship between Kitty and Puss goes through a realistic evolution during this adventure. Perrito is a mixture of being innocent and wise about life, but not in a contrived and cloying way. He is by far the most adorable and sincere character in the movie, so expect kids (and quite a few adults) to want Perrito toys and other Perrito merchandise after seeing this movie. When Perrito tells his tragic backstory about his human family making numerous attempts to abandon him, Perrito chooses to remember it with so much optimism, he describes these abandonment attempts as the family playing pranks on him.  Goldi has her own family issues: Even though the bears raised her as one of their own, she still feels like a misfit because she’s a human in a family of bears. Jack is an unfortunate example of someone who was bullied as a child but then grew up to be a bully. As for Wolf, he might not be what he first appears to be, and his actions in the movie might not be as easy to predict as some people might think. All of the cast members give very good performances, with Banderas, Hayek, Guillén and Pugh as the standouts. They all make their characters sound like they have fully formed personalities instead of being two-dimensional cartoon characters reciting lines. The movie’s snappy dialogue can be enjoyed by people of all ages (open-minded adults will appreciate the cheeky almost-cursing in the movie), while the plot has some predictability but also some innovation that’s unexpected.  “Puss in Boots” might disappoint some people expecting to hear more original songs in the movie. However, the centerpiece original song (“Fearless Hero”), which is heard at different times in the movie, is catchy and memorable. Navarro, Heitor Pereira and Paul Fisher co-wrote “Fearless Hero,” which at one point is performed by Banderas and Pereira in the movie. Navarro and Daniel Oviedo co-wrote “La Vida Es Una,” performed by Karol G during the movie’s end credits. Everything in “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish: is well-paced, with the action scenes particularly fun to watch. When Puss in Boots first made an appearance in “Shrek 2,” he was a true scene-stealer. With “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” the Puss in Boots franchise is now stealing some of the thunder from the better-known “Shrek” movies. And the high quality and engaging story of “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” make it the type of movie that can be considered a beloved treasure by fans of animated films. Universal Pictures/DreamWorks Animation will release “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish” in U.S. cinemas on December 21, 2022. A sneak preview of the movie was shown in U.S. cinemas on November 26, 2022.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2022"," 
	Turns out, the Shrek sidekick has died eight times already, which explains why he considers himself invincible. Now it's time for Puss to confront what really matters in this gorgeous standalone. 
	More than a decade after “Shrek” prequel/spinoff “Puss in Boots,” the flamboyant feline is up to his old tricks — but has yet to meet the computer-animated ogre whose party he’s destined to crash in “Shrek 2.” As that series wore on, the “Shrek” franchise took on so many popular side characters that by the fourth outing, there was hardly room left to swing a cat. 
	Co-written by Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow with charmingly Spanish-embellished dialogue throughout, this fairytale-adjacent adventure opens with Puss losing his eighth life. This kitty’s too cocky to realize it at first, but the town vet gives him a rough recap of his previous deaths, which makes for a hilarious (for us) and sobering (for Puss) montage of all the ways his grandiose ego (so perfectly captured by “The Mask of Zorro” star Antonio Banderas’ voice work) has endangered him till now. 
	After that dramatic showdown reduces Puss to a quivering scaredy-cat, our hero scampers off to live with Mama Luna (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), a self-described “cat fancier” whose feline-infested home always has room for one more stray. Desperate and humbled, Puss buries his cavalier hat, cape and boots in the yard and tries to blend in, meeting a nameless mutt in kitty disguise among Mama Luna’s three dozen or so rescues. 
	The movie keeps piling on characters as it goes — from Goldi (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears crime family to good-boy-gone-bad Jack Horner (John Mulaney) — until such time that the ensemble has swollen to “Shrek”-like levels. But don’t fret! Mother Goose reject Jack Horner makes for a lame villain. But as complicated as the plot gets, it’s all grounded by characters with clearly defined desires, which makes sense, since they’re all seeking the same thing: A shooting star has landed in the Dark Forest, and whoever reaches it first is entitled to a wish. 
	Puss wants his lives back. The others, including Puss’ former paramour Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault), have equally compelling motives. Only Puss’ mangy canine amigo (Harvey Guillén) seems content with what he’s got, which you’d better believe is going to rub off on the others. Still, it takes a sharp script to do so in such a surprising way, and that’s more than most toons can wish for. 
	The movie feels most inspired in its first half-hour, when Puss get shaken out of his comfort zone, which is accompanied by a huge shift in visual style for a DreamWorks toon: Eschewing traditional CG codes, production designer Nate Wragg aims for an expressionistic storybook feel, with no lines and a refreshing rejection of photorealistic detail. Instead of distracting us with how lifelike Puss’ fur follicles look, the crew embraces a more painterly approach that still allows the virtual camera to ricochet through space during action sequences. That same dynamism was a signature of the earlier film, with its swooping rooftop chases, that looks infinitely better in this new style. 
	It’s alarming how quickly computer-animated toons start to look dated. Most audiences won’t pick up on it, but the character rigs are vastly improved here. In the “Shrek” movies, the shoulders so often looked weird, whereas this time around, humans and animals alike have a much greater and more convincing range of postures. Add to that the painterly upgrade, and “Puss” will have paved the way for an all-new aesthetic when the studio decides to give “Shrek” a reboot.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2022"," The actor again voices the intrepid cat, who's now down to his last life, in a sequel also featuring voice work by Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman and Salma Hayek. 
	Hey kids, want to see a movie revolving around an aging male character dealing with a mid-life crisis who’s desperately afraid of his impending mortality? Just in time for Christmas? 
	If you’re wondering how he lost so many, screenwriters Paul FIsher and Tommy Swerdlow vividly illustrate the causes of his many demises in a hilarious montage that illustrates the frequent wit on display in DreamWorks Animation offerings. Not all of those deaths are heroic, as demonstrated by his gluttonous losing battle with a shellfish allergy. 
	Darker in tone but still extremely funny, the film, like so many of its animated brethren, falters when resorting to the frenetic action sequences seemingly designed for tykes’ short attention spans. Those exhausting episodes pale in comparison to such uproarious scenes as a saucer-eyed feline face-off in which Puss attempts to prove he’s the most adorable.  
	Also highly amusing are the scenes involving the tiny, Jiminy Cricket-inspired Ethical Bug, who fruitlessly attempts to serve as Jack Horner’s conscience. (He’s voiced by DreamWorks Animation story supervisor Kevin McCann, doing a fun riff on Jimmy Stewart).",POSITIVE

The sequel, “Shrek 2,” introduced something even more important: The Antonio Banderas-voiced, Zorro-inspired Puss in Boots, a swashbuckling ginger cat with a tiny sword, a smart pair of boots, and an adorable pair of enormous kitten eyes. He got his own movie in 2011 after the main Shrek quadrilogy was finished, and its long-awaited follow-up, “Puss in Boots: The Last Wish,” finally debuts this year. Puss in Boots (Banderas) has spent a lifetime performing daring deeds and laughing in the face of death. Eight lifetimes, in fact: after a particularly heroic battle, Puss finds out that he’s used up almost all of his nine lives, and only has one left. He’s not truly concerned, though, until he comes nose-to-nose with the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), a cloaked bounty hunter wielding two scythe blades who has never allowed a wanted criminal to escape. During Puss’s search for safety, he comes across Guy Ritchie-esque crime family Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo) who are hunting down the map to a legendary wishing star that fell to Earth long ago. With the help of the sweet yet buffoonish Perrito (Harvey Guillen) and Puss’s old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), Puss embarks on a quest to find the star and wish for all his lives back, hounded at every turn by the bears, the Wolf, and magic-obsessed mafioso Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) of the plum pie nursery rhyme. “The Last Wish” continues the Shrek franchise’s tongue-in-cheek penchant for throwing popular fairy tale characters into the same world and seeing what comes out. Pugh voices Goldilocks with a gruff “oi oi” London drawl and Mulaney is a treat as violent manchild Jack, darkly intoning the nursery rhyme’s catchphrase “What a good boy am I” at a pivotal moment in the film. The Wolf is particularly frightening as an almost literal personification of Puss’s deep-seated fear of death, appearing out of dark corners with glowing red eyes and a sinister whistle that makes the cat’s fur stand on end. DreamWorks’ animation department (for which “The Last Wish” debuts a brand-new logo honoring the studio’s most popular characters) has long been one of the more underrated in terms of trying out new styles and aesthetics from film to film (the “Boss Baby” franchise notwithstanding), and “The Last Wish” has a particularly fun blend of standard computer imagery combined with the sketchy look of hand-drawn animation and the fast-paced flip-book style fight choreography popularized by “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” Perhaps what makes “The Last Wish” a cut above the rest is the deftness with which it eases the audience into the Lesson of the Day format of most animated children’s movies. Ultimately, Puss’s desire to be free from death keeps him from enjoying his life — a somewhat darker concept than one usually finds in children’s media, especially geared towards an audience as young as this film’s. It never, however, plasters whatever it has to say all over the screen, allowing story beats to unfold naturally and in surprising ways. Goldilocks’ secret reason for pursuing the wishing star is particularly unexpected, yet it fits, and it’s handled with grace. “The Last Wish” has no qualms about testing the expectations of its young audience while delivering a freewheeling tale about appreciating the nine lives we already have.  By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

"Nov 27, 2022",&#8220;Puss In Boots&#58; The Last Wish&#8221; is just as fresh as the original spin-off&#44; exciting from beginning to end&#44; and one of the best animated films of 2022&#46;,POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2022"," Admit it. You thought the Shrek franchise was dead and buried. After the original film compltely changed the animation game in 2001 and Shrek 2 proved to be the rare sequel that lived up to its predecessor, the series limped to a disappointing third film in 2007 and a tepid conclusion in 2010 barely anyone remembers. The Puss in Boots spin-off in 2011 fared better with critics and audiences and even earned an Oscar nod for Best Animated Feature. Since then, however, this once mighty fairy tale universe has sat oddly silent. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes, this seemingly dormant franchise roars back to life with one of the best animated films of the year. Stunningly animated and brought to life by a superb ensemble voice cast, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is the biggest surprise of the season. Aided by a genuinely emotional narrative and an equal serving of heart and humour, this unassuming sequel manages to defy all expectations…and then some. As we rejoin the Shrek world, we find Puss in Boots (a dynamic Antonio Banderas) is just as brash and confident as ever and still considered a wanted outlaw vigilante with a bounty on his head. While he’s spent years literally laughing in the face of death, Puss is compelled to reckon with his mortality after dying during an epic battle and being informed by a doctor that he’s just used up eight of his nine lives. At first, Puss doesn’t seem too concerned until he’s confronted by the Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura), a menacing bounty hunter wielding two scythe blades who’s never failed to capture whoever he makes his latest target. After fleeing from a potentially fatal battle and abandoning his identity to hide out at a cat rescue, Puss soon learns of the fable of the Wishing Star, a crashed shooting star hidden deep in the Dark Forest that will grant its owner one single wish i.e. the answer to regaining the lives he’s lost along the way. There’s just one small problem; he’s not the only one seeking to find it. Joining forces with his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek Pinault) and a doe-eyed unwanted wannabe therapy dog Perro (Harvey Guillén), Puss embarks on a quest to locate the fallen star before it can fall into the hands of magic-obsessed underworld kingpin Big Jack Horner (John Mulaney) or the crime family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman, and Samson Kayo). But this journey is no easy task and the Dark Forest has plenty of tricks up its sleeve that will force every character to confront the reasons behind their true desire for one magic wish. After more than a decade, Banderas effortlessly slips back into the role of the loveable, cocky, and surprisingly complex feline who is now a fascinating mix of bravado and fear. Banderas can capture Puss’ brash persona with ease, but he digs deeper to reveal layers of endearing vulnerability hiding beneath his confident demeanour. On this adventure, Puss must reckon with his past and the follies of his cavalier attitude towards death and those around him, offering Banderas the chance to deliver something completely different to the previous incarnations of this utterly charming character. Hayek Pinault is equally as effective as the sultry vixen harbouring her own trauma at her past interactions with the selfish hero who can’t seem to realise she’s the best thing that ever happened to him. The equally heartwarming and hilarious Guillén captures focus at every turn as the adorably naive pooch searching for companionship after years of being ignored and abandoned. Mulaney is a riot as a petulant brat with a large chip on his shoulder and a big bag of magic tricks with callbacks to numerous other enchanted tales. And Dreamworks Animation story supervisor Kevin McCann almost runs away with the entire film as a Jimmy Stewart-sounding insect character that’s best left unspoiled. But the real scene-stealers are Goldilocks and the Three Bears, with Pugh and Colman adopting Cockney accents to match those of Winstone and Kayo that’s pure casting genius. This quartet work so damn well together, creating a family dynamic that’s entirely magnetic. Screenwriters Paul Fisher and Tommy Swerdlow shrewdly twist Goldi’s backstory to that of an orphan girl taken in by a trio of bears and raised as their daughter, allowing Pugh to create something wildly original and rather compelling. Her secret desire to find the Wishing Star is something wonderfully unexpected but handled with a soft touch by director Joel Crawford that may bring a tear to your eye. And then there’s Moura as one of the most genuinely unsettling animated villains in years. Visually, the Big Bag Wolf is a terrifying sight, with his twisting sickle blades, glaring red eyes, and towering size. A threatening whistle is utilised to announce his close proximity in a similar vein to John Williams’ score in Jaws. This sound leaves the hairs standing up all over Puss’ body and may cause a shiver to run down your spine. He is quite literally the personification of the mortality that’s stalking Puss wherever he goes, like an ever-lingering reminder that his days are numbered. I’m a grown adult and even I was rather disturbed by this brilliantly crafted evil character, so consider yourself warned for your little ones. There is a darker tone to a film with the confidence to explore rather heady themes including the meaning of life, the inevitability of death, and the journey to finding your true family. It’s balanced by a hefty dose of slapstick humour, zippy one-liners, nostalgic cameos, and wild action that will delight young audiences. But there’s a moral to this tale that will resonate with slightly older viewers and it’s not afraid to challenge as much as it is to entertain. Naturally, there are numerous thrilling set pieces that burst off to the screening, making this one of the most fully-rounded pieces of animated cinema Dreamworks Animation has ever offered. Where Puss in Boots: The Last Wish really shines is the stellar way Crawford and his design team have completely reworked the animation style of previous Shrek films into something rather breathtaking and completely fresh for this lagging franchise. It’s a brilliant fusion of 3D CGI animation with 2D concepts in a beautiful storybook style reminiscent of films like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Klaus, and The Bad Guys. There’s a gorgeous painterly quality to every single with occasional influences from the world of Japanese anime in the movements and expressions of its characters. It’s unlike anything you’ve seen from this studio and a necessary move to revitalise this saga into bold new ground. A visual wonder with an emotional core that hards to beat, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a real winner. Its screenplay soars with a plot rich in depth and nuance. Its characters are fascinating and enchanting. Its action is exhilerating and perfectly crafted. Its style is unique and daring. And its ending leaves you yearning for more. This is precisely how you reboot an animated franchise. Colour me surprised, but this is an unexpected home run from Dreamworks Animation no one really saw coming.",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2022"," Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is going to take a lot of viewers by complete surprise. There are a lot of elements that go into this film that make it one of the best of the year. The animation is gorgeous, the voice cast brings their A-game, the writing is brilliant, and the story itself is emotional and heartwarming. There are important lessons weaved throughout the film for viewers of all ages that teach about appreciating what is right in front of you. All too often we are focused on our wants so hard that we completely miss what we have in our lives already.  Antonio Banderas is back as the lead character and this time, we see him like we never have before — quite a bit defeated. Salma Hayek also reprises her role as Kitty Softpaws and although she does not want to spend her time with Puss In Boots, she is basically forced to.  This story starts off with a falling star and ultimately it follows several different groups of characters who venture out to find said star. Why? So that they can make a wish, of course. The one who finds it will be granted one wish. The movie focuses on all of the wishes that these characters would make if they are the one to reach it first, as well as the all out battle over the map that will get them there. Each one has something very specific in mind, and as viewers learn them, it is easy to become invested in the tale. While these characters all feel that they deserve the wish, the journey there allows them time to reflect on their lives. The writing here is absolutely brilliant as it finds a way to add in a lot of unique moments. That said, there is one twist that is quite predictable, for most audiences at least. However some children will be blown away when the reveal comes, which means it does its job. The overall lessons are important ones, and the way they shine through the storytelling is truly heartwarming. Have tissues handy because there are some moments that are so emotional, they are sure to bring a few tears to the eyes. Do you need to have seen any of the Shrek films, or even the first Puss In Boots movie? The short answer is no. Thanks to the brilliant writing this film tells a cohesive enough story that it is easy to come into this world knowing nothing and enjoy it to the fullest. Will certain things make a little more sense if you have seen them? Of course. DreamWorks was sure to throw in some payoff for fans of the franchise, but this can easily be your first introduction to it and you will be just fine. Don’t let not having seen the others shy you away from going to see Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. One of the very best things about this film is the voice acting, and the unique and entertaining characters. John Mulaney‘s Jack Horner is absolutely hilarious and the perfect villain for the story. He is very clearly a spoiled man baby who is willing to do anything — and we mean anything — to get what he wants. Because of this he provides some of the most enjoyable and funny moments of the movie.  Harvey Guillen‘s Perro, however, is the biggest standout of Puss In Boots: The Last Wish. He is a lovable dog who is honest, innocent, and just wants to have a good time with his friends. He provides a lot of the wisdom and life lessons throughout the movie, in a way that feels completely on accident. Perro also delivers the majority of the comedic relief, providing viewers with many laugh out loud moments. Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the three bears bring a brutality and gruffness to the story, but they also bring a lot of the heart. They are all dealing with their own issues, but they are an important part of the story. There is a character that everyone will be able to relate to as they all bring something unique to the table. So is he so scary that you shouldn’t see this movie? Nah. Eyes can be covered if need be. Puss In Boots: The Last Wish is too good to skip because of this minute detail.  Puss In Boots: The Last Wish brings action and heart to the big screen. This movie deserves to be seen in theaters, not only because of the incredible animation, but because of the beautiful story that it tells. While there are some moments that start to drag or feel repetitive, the writing is smart enough that it doesn’t take away from too much of the film. The Puss In Boots sequel is fun, hilarious, and gives viewers some epic action sequences. This is one that the whole family will enjoy, so don’t miss it this holiday season! For the first time in more than a decade, DreamWorks Animation presents a new adventure in the Shrek universe as daring outlaw Puss in Boots discovers that his passion for peril and disregard for safety have taken their toll. Puss has burned through eight of his nine lives, though he lost count along the way. Getting those lives back will send Puss in Boots on his grandest quest yet. Academy Award® nominee Antonio Banderas returns as the voice of the notorious PiB as he embarks on an epic journey into the Black Forest to find the mythical Wishing Star and restore his lost lives. But with only one life left, Puss will have to humble himself and ask for help from his former partner and nemesis: the captivating Kitty Soft Paws (Oscar® nominee Salma Hayek). In their quest, Puss and Kitty will be aided—against their better judgment—by a ratty, chatty, relentlessly cheerful mutt, Perro (Harvey Guillén, What We Do in the Shadows). Together, our trio of heroes will have to stay one step ahead of Goldilocks (Oscar® nominee Florence Pugh, Black Widow) and the Three Bears Crime Family, “Big” Jack Horner (Emmy winner John Mulaney, Big Mouth) and terrifying bounty hunter, The Big Bad Wolf (Wagner Moura, Narcos).
