"Mar 11, 2024"," Dice que, en esta vida, para todo hay una primera vez. Este 2023, en lo que respecta a mi relación con el séptimo arte en múltiples aspectos ha habido varias sorpresas inesperada, pero si debo destacar una por encima del resto esa es, sin duda, que Zack Snyder ha conseguido decepcionarme plenamente con uno de sus largometrajes desde que inició su filmografía en un ya lejano 2004 con 'Amanecer de los muertos'. Hasta la fecha, todas y cada una de sus películas —con sus evidentes e inevitables altibajos— habían conseguido encandilarme por diferentes motivos, incluyendo su incursión en la animación con una 'Ga'Hoole' merecedora de muchos más elogios de los que ha recibido. Desgraciadamente, estas navidades han traído bajo el brazo un regalo envenenado titulado 'Rebel Moon'. Desde su estreno el pasado 22 de diciembre han corrido ríos de tinta —o de ceros y unos, mejor dicho— en diferentes medios especializados y, por supuesto, en unas redes sociales en las que se sigue tratando a Snyder con un paternalismo rematadamente absurdo. El consenso general es que la 'Star Wars' particular del de Green Bay es un auténtico desastre; una opinión que, bajo mi punto de vista, lleva al extremo sus claras deficiencias. Pero, ¿qué convierte la ambiciosa producción de Netflix en el que, posiblemente, sea el último gran batacazo creativo del curso cinematográfico 2023? A pesar de que pueda dispararse en múltiples direcciones, tengo claro que el motivo no radica en su barroquismo digital, en las recargadas filias de Snyder como director o en esa presunta mente de adolescente a la que se aferran sus detractores para destriparle a golpe de tuit; sino en el elemento que sirve de motor a cualquier título: los personajes. No cabe duda de que 'Rebel Moon' tiene un buen puñado de frentes abiertos que la hacen no funcionar como debería pero, por encima de todo —y como suele ser habitual—, sus mayores problemas llegan de la mano de su narrativa. Una serie de inconsistencias que afectan severamente al conjunto y que, salvando las distancias, tienen puntos en común con lo ocurrido con el montaje cinematográfico de la 'Napoleón' de Ridley Scott. Puede que lo peor, y lo que más daña al filme en última instancia, sea su cadencia narrativa tremendamente apresurada y cargada de elipsis, probablemente concebida en la sala de montaje. A excepción de su primer acto, que sí se molesta en presentar la aldea de Kora y plantear el conflicto principal y el detonante con bastante acierto, el resto del metraje parece estar ensamblado pisando a fondo el acelerador y sin conceder un solo segundo de reposo. A esto, debemos sumar una estructura casi episódica propia de una serie de televisión que chirría especialmente dentro de un metraje de dos horas y cuarto. Los saltos entre localizaciones son constantes, las escenas se resuelven en unos pocos parpadeos y las entradas y salidas de personajes son, cuando menos, fugaces; lo cual hace que la historia pase sin pena ni gloria en pantalla, como si la causalidad se hubiese dejado a un lado y todo pase simplemente porque tiene que ocurrir. Todo ello deriva en la mayor lacra que puede tener cualquier tipo de producción: que los personajes no importen lo más mínimo. A excepción de Kora, que tiene algo más de desarrollo, no sabemos prácticamente nada del grupo protagonista, cuyos miembros son introducidos con unas cuantas líneas de diálogo que dan un mínimo de trasforndo, pero obviamente no el suficiente; sus dinámicas no están en absoluto trabajadas y terminan convirtiéndose en poco menos que en carne de cañón. Si no establecemos un vínculo con los héroes y sufrimos con su lucha por alcanzar sus objetivos, la emoción brilla por su ausencia, y sin emoción, no hay película defendible. Algo que se asevera con un tratamiento formal tremendamente plano —salvo honrosas excepciones marca de la casa y a pesar de la notable mano del director para planificar— y digno de cualquier serie impersonal enterrada en el catálogo de la plataforma, o con unos actores que parecen estar fuera de lugar. Tristemente, todo lo enumerado previamente podría haber sido perdonable de haber existido un mayor cuidado a la hora de moldear a los protagonistas y ubicarles como es debido en un universo que, sin duda, se percibe más rico de lo que se ha terminado mostrando en pantalla; demostrando una vez más que escribir, dirigir y montar debe hacerse única y exclusivamente con los personajes en mente. El resto, espectáculo visual incluido, no deja de ser algo secundario.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 29, 2024","In the end, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is ridiculous, unoriginal, and stereotypical. But also? There is a lot of fun to be had, especially if someone can Jedi mindtrick you into forgetting you knew anything about Star Wars.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 2, 2024"," Happy February! We’re technically still in Winter in Minnesota, but you wouldn’t know it looking at the weather forecast. We’ve had a mild December and just a few frigid days in January, but it ended with a record-breaking temp. Per MPR, yesterday was the warmest Jan 31 in 150 years in the Twin Cities as temp topped out at 55 degrees on Wednesday afternoon. It broke the previous record of 46 degrees by 9 degrees, whoa! My hubby and I went out for a walk around a nearby lake in a light jacket, and the weird thing was I still saw a few people ice-fishing in the middle of the frozen lake! That’s Minnesotans for ya! I first heard of this film when news came out that Peter Sarsgaard won Best Actor at the Venice Film Festival last year. Somehow his name dropped off the radar come award season, which is a shame as his performance was terrific here. It’s a well-acted two-hander starring Sarsgaard and the always-watchable Jessica Chastain, Memory is a deeply layered and moving drama about past trauma and finding connection when you least expect it. It can be slow and tough to watch at times but well worth your time just for the lead performances alone. This was a really cute animated movie with Adam Sandler, Bill Burr, Cecily Strong (who’s so funny on SNL, I miss her!). The idea of a 74-year-old lizard named Leo and his turtle friend escaping their Florida school terrarium is quite a hoot. I was expecting a silly fish-out-of-water (well, a lizard-out-of-its-terrarium in this case) comedy, but LEO turns out to be quite a gem of a movie about unlikely friendships, loyalty, and aging gracefully, plus there are some life lessons delivered in a fun but endearing way. Oh, just so you know, this is an animated musical, but the songs are catchy and entertaining! I grew up loving cars thanks to my twin brothers, and my late brother used to play the Gran Turismo video game. What I didn’t realize was that this movie is based on a true story where gamers get to compete in real racing cars, thanks to crazy but ingenious ideas by a Nissan marketing exec (Orlando Bloom). I had just seen Archie Madekwe in Saltburn but he gets to flex his acting chops in a leading role here. The movie centers on two underdogs, Jann the gamer (Madekwe) and a failed former race driver Jack (David Harbour) working together to achieve the impossible. Overall I find it more enjoyable than Ferrari and the racing scenes, including the crashes, are well-staged, it uses CGI in an effective way to showcase the video game elements that enhance its storytelling. I was surprised that Neill Blomkamp directed this, I haven’t liked anything he’s done since District 9 in 2009. Mélanie Laurent directs and stars in this French action comedy… the tone is a bit off but manages to still be quite entertaining thanks to exhilarating high-octane action and the fun chemistry of the female cast, notably Adèle Exarchopoulos. An incredible true story of Australian teenager Jessica Watson, the youngest person ever to sail solo non-stop around the world. The subject matter is so fascinating that it deserves a much more compelling movie! Wish they gave the talented Cliff Curtis something worthy to do here. My goodness, where do I start?? I was curious to see if this is as bad as the critics say… well, as it turns out they’re spot on. This is the most inept, boring, pointless movie… not sure why people even compliment the visuals as it’s visually garish + ugly! Apparently, the project started out as Zack Snyder’s space opera concept pitch to Lucasfilm that got rejected. Well, Star Wars isn’t the only thing Snyder mined for inspiration, the 135-minute overlong slog is a chaotic compilation of so many better sci-fi fantasy franchises: Lord of the Rings, Avatar, Magnificent Seven, Kurosawa samurai epics, and so on. It’s such a waste of the talented cast, with Charlie Hunnam being the only bright spot (the one star is mostly for him) but wish he picked a better movie. This is by far the worst movie I saw of the entire month, probably of the year, too. I managed to finish two miniseries this month! Love both of them… I’ve written a review of BODIES, and will write about Lessons in Chemistry later this month. I highly recommend both of them, it’s time absolutely well-spent! Per Women In Film (WIF) organization, the basic rules of 52 Films By Women are simple: watch 52 films directed by women within one year and share what you watched on social media, using the hashtag #52FilmsByWomen to spread the word, and get more people talking about the women filmmakers that don’t always get attention. I’m starting the year strong with no less than seven movies #directedbywomen – woot! During the second week of January, I watched four female-directed movies back to back: Anatomy of a Fall, ORIGIN, Wingwomen, and True Spirit, then added the other 3: NYAD, Priscilla, and Silent Night in the last week of the month. I saw Poor Things much later than I would have liked but it was well worth the long wait!! It ends up making up my top 3 of the year, beating out Oppenheimer! It’s currently my favorite of Yorgos Lanthimos‘ work, though I have yet to see Killing of a Sacred Deer. Bravo to Emma Stone for her spectacular performance and for getting her first Oscar nom as a producer! For me, the film of the month is Babylon.  My only interest in Rebel Moon is to see Jena Malone as a spider as that is fucked-up combination of seeing the actress that I love being the thing I fear the most. I saw her name in the cast in IMDb so I kept looking for her. I didn’t realize it was her as the big spider… man she’s too good to be used in that way, but that movie wasted the talented cast! I do know what you mean though, it’s gotta be weird to see your fave actress playing the thing you fear most. I’m scared of spiders too! I still can’t believe how warm it’s been this winter here but I think we’ll get dump with a big snow storm and cold temps soon. I hope I’m wrong but this is MN. Lol! I got about halfway through Wingwomen then I turned it off. It started out well but the story didn’t go anywhere and I lost interest. Rebel Moon was one of the ugliest piece of crap movies I’ve ever seen. I don’t know how Snyder is still being employed by Netflix. His other movie, Army of the Dead, also looked like shit. The only “new” movie I saw last month was Cloud Atlas, a film that came out over a decade ago. I totally missed it when it first came out and realized that I have it on Blu-ray and decided to finally watch it. I thought it’s great but I do remember how divisive it was back in 2012. I watched mostly TV series. Finished the second season of Reacher and the latest season of Fargo. Yeah, Wingwomen is odd, but I kept on watching because I like the French actresses. It’s still waaaay better than Rebel Moon though, that is just the dumbest and ugliest thing I’ve seen in a long while. It ought to win ALL the Razzies!! I’ve been watching a lot of French action films on Netflix and looked forward to watching Wingwomen since the trailer looked it was going to be a fun action thriller. But once they arrived in that small town, the story just didn’t go anywhere and I got bored and turned it off. I think the Razzies might be even too good for Rebel Moon. I still can’t believe Snyder got millions of dollars from Netflix to make not just one but two Rebel Moon movies. I thought Cloud Atmas was the best film of the Wachowskis since The Matrix. They haven’t anything good since then. And yes, I remember reading your review of it over a decade ago. Lol! Yeah Melanie Laurent is so multitalented! It’s kinda a weird movie but still worth a watch for the cast! Ohhh yes, do see Poor Things, it’s worth seeing on the big screen! Film is in my blood. LOVE movies of all genres, from Jane Austen to James Bond. Official blogger for the Twin Cities Film Fest (TCFF). I’ve written and produced my first short film » HEARTS WANT in 2017 and currently working on developing the full story as a feature film.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 1, 2024"," While “Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire” — hitting Netflix this week, after a limited theatrical run, and to be followed in April on the streaming service by “Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver” —- also was influenced by “The Lord of the Rings,” “The Dirty Dozen” and more, it shares much with the 1977 film now titled “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.” There’s a malevolent galactic empire. Lightsaber-like swords. A scoundrel pilot. A polite robot. A bar scuffle. And, most importantly, a messiah figure pulled from an existence as a farmer. But while watching this first “Rebel Moon,” you can’t help but wonder if Snyder’s specific idea was to do “Star Wars” but without any of the fun. Snyder — whose credits include 2006’s “300,” several DC Extended Universe movies, including the much-discussed “Zack Snyder’s Justice League” in 2021, and “Army of the Dead” for Netflix later that year — has crafted a grandios but soulless tale that begins with some promise but wears you out over two-plus hours with the violent, slow-motion action sequences for which the director is so well known. In lieu of an opening crawl, Snyder gives us narration from the great Anthony Hopkins, who — in a movie boasting character names such as Titus, Nemesis and Devra Bloodaxe — goes by … Jimmy. We learn about a king, a princess and the Motherworld, which is using its military, the Imperium, to try to squash a growing resistance, a sort of rebel alliance, if you will. We then meet the good people of a village on the moon Veldt, who can produce a small surplus of food after harvesting grain for themselves and where a mysterious stranger named Kora (Sofia Boutella) has been taken in and helps farm the land. An Imperium warship arrives above the planet, and the villagers are visited by a force led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), an officer giving off serious Nazi vibes and demanding they produce so much food for the military that they will not have enough left to feed themselves. Although she initially plans to flee Veldt, Kora quickly runs afoul of military men about to have their way with Sam (Charlotte Maggi), a sweet young woman. Soon, she and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, “The Flight Attendant”), who oversees the harvest, leave to recruit others willing to help them fight the Imperium. The first recruit is Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot and self-proclaimed “opportunist,” who takes them to other parts of the galaxy, where they pick up swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae, “Jupiter Ascending”); revolutionary Karian Bloodaxe (“Justice League” alum Ray Fisher), brother of Devra (Cleopatra Coleman, “Dopesick”); Bloodaxe footsoldeer Milius (E. Duffy); the once-regal Tarak (Staz Nair, “Supergirl”); and former military commander Titus (Djimon Hounsou, “A Quiet Place: Part II”). The building of this fellowship is the meat of this first “Rebel Moon,” and it is almost wholly uninteresting. It is joyless — an adventure that never feels remotely adventurous, despite little action pieces such as Nemesis’ fight with Harmada (Jena Malone), a half-woman, half-spider who has kidnapped a human girl. Reportedly, next year also will see an R-rated and extended cut of this film, said to be about an hour longer. It’s amazing that a movie that drags as much as “Child of Fire” can also feel rushed, at least in terms of its storytelling. As presently constructed, the movie’s narrative elements feel as though they’re being held together by fraying threads. Here’s hoping that added time will allow for at least SOME character development, as there is very little to be found in this version. There’s probably no saving the movie, but given the screen presence of Hunnam (“Triple Frontier,” “The Gentlemen”), Kai being fleshed out to the point of serving as even a poor man’s version of Han Solo would be something. (Do we even dare to dream Snyder could stitch together a bit of a love triangle for Kora, Kai and Gunnar? Probably best we don’t.) Boutella (2107’s “The Mummy” and “Atomic Blonde”) is pretty stiff in the lead role, but it’s also surely tough for any actor to shine in a Snyder movie, where all that stylized action — presented as slowly as possible — is the top priority. The best work is turned in by Skrein (“Midway”); even if Atticus isn’t likely to prove to be a memorable villain, he is sufficiently hateable all the same, especially in his tension-filled introduction. He works under the little-seen Regent Belisarius (Fra Fee, “Hawkeye”), who has a connection to Kora and who seems poised for a more significant part in “Scargiver.” That also would seem to be the case with Jimmy (Jimmy!), who’s mostly forgotten about after Kora’s altercation on Veldt. (If nothing else, Zack Snyder, please give us more Anthony Hopkins.) If there’s one area where Snyder succeeds with “Rebel Moon” is world-building. Sure, this universe has some things in common with a galaxy far, far away, but there are some inventive elements, such as one character you meet in the aforementioned cantina.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 31, 2024"," WHAT IT'S ABOUT Stop us if you've heard this before: In a galaxy far away from our own, a band of rebels gathers to fight back against militaristic oppressors, an empire bent on intergalactic conquest and subjugation. These rebels include a farmer, a smuggler trying to go straight, a former general and various warriors. They're led by a hero with deep ties to the evil regime. Oh, and there's a talking robot. If the world of Zack Snyder's “Rebel Moon” sounds an awful lot like a “Star Wars” castoff, that's not only because the “Justice League” filmmaker once pitched it to Lucasfilm. The finished product, set to be unveiled in two parts (the first of which, subtitled “Part One — A Child of Fire” is now on Netflix) as well as a director's cut, plays like the Bizarro World version of a “Star Wars” movie. The hero in question, named Kora (Sofia Boutella), has abandoned her life as a highly trained soldier and the adopted daughter of the evil senator Balisarius (Fra Fee), who now lords over the movie's version of the Empire, called the Motherworld. Kora has traded it all for life in a simple farming community. But her idyll gets shattered when Balisarius' right-hand man, the sadistic Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), lands there, kills the community's leader (Corey Stoll) and threatens the rest with a violent return unless they compensate him with most of their grain. So an interplanetary recruitment trip must begin, with Kora joined by the farmer Gunnar (Michael Huisman) on a search for the right collection of resistance fighters. Cast members also include Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam and Anthony Hopkins, who gives voice to the aforementioned robot. MY SAY There's nothing fundamentally wrong with pursuing a “Star Wars”-adjacent project. So much of modern sci-fi today still remains shaped and inspired by that universe. But even as Snyder attempts to construct a world of his own in “Rebel Moon,” it's so similar that it becomes hard to take seriously on its own terms. Throw in some of the classic Western genre tropes that also inspired George Lucas and are about as old as the movies themselves, and you're left longing for any number of dozens upon dozens of better options. Were one able to get past all that, there's still the endless exposition to contend with and dialogue that consists in large part of endless droning monologues that have a knack for sapping out any semblance of suspense or tension. Throw in a good measure of slow-motion action, the same stuff Snyder has been known for since he directed “300,” which came out in 2007. Add to it a general aura in which everything feels impossibly overdone, with some of the creatures of this universe crossing the line from creative and cool to downright unsettling, and you wind up with a picture that feels more like a bad episode of cosplaying than a compelling new vision.",NEGATIVE

"Jan 17, 2024"," Individuals can make a difference against an oppressive or authoritarian system or colonizer. You can't negotiate with bad actors. Not everyone can be trusted. Don't judge a book by its cover. A village of farmers works collectively for the common good. Some characters put themselves in harm's way for the benefit of others, even to the point of sacrificing their own lives. There's much discussion of honor and what it means to act honorably. Characters have suffered the trauma of extreme violence and loss, which they either run from or try to face and overcome. Others seem to want to redeem themselves from their actions in the past. The film is set on a string of planets with a diversity of human and human-like species as well as a variety of creatures and robots. The lead cast is also diverse, with actors hailing from Algeria, Holland, Scotland, England, Ireland, Benin, Korea, Australia, Iceland, and more. English is the main language spoken, in a variety of accents. Graphic fight scenes involve on-screen deaths, including by sword, knife, falls, guns, explosions, broken bones, and more. People are killed in front of those who love them. Men threaten sexual violence toward a young woman. Creepy creatures appear to suck life out of or give life to humans; another half woman/half spider tries to avenge the destruction of her planet. Kids are put in peril through kidnappings, invasions, and battles. Adults recall the destruction around them as children, including the murders of their families. A man is shackled. A soldier appears to enjoy being cruel and killing. Teeth fly out of a man hit in the head. Technology is used to bring someone back to life and it's mentioned that a brain will be dissected. A village leader calls for his people to go home and ""make love"" to celebrate with the ""thrusting of hips."" A person makes reference to the sounds of lovemaking. A man wants to pay to have sex with another man, and he grabs his groin, telling him he'll be left begging for more. There is kissing and the suggestion of crushes and settling down. Characters drink ale and other concoctions at celebrations and a bar. A man connects his body to an infusion-looking machine that appears to give him a drug-like pleasure. Parents need to know that Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a sci-fi fantasy epic from director Zack Snyder featuring an international cast and graphic violence. There is also some swearing, including ""s--t,"" ""hell,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" and more. Fight scenes involve on-screen deaths, sometimes of beloved characters in front of their loved ones, including by sword, knife, falls, guns, explosions, broken bones, and more.

To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. After an insurrection leaves the benevolent royal family of the Motherworld dead, no corner of the universe is safe in REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE. That includes the residents of the peaceful farming village of Veldt, where Kora (Sofia Boutella) hides her warrior past. When the cruel commander Noble (Ed Skrein) and a fleet of soldiers land in Veldt and make impossible demands, Kora opts to run -- again -- rather than stay and fight. A single incident forces her to change her mind, so she and fellow villager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set off across planets to round up a band of rebels to try to save Veldt. They include gun-for-hire Kai (Charlie Hunnam), General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae), Prince Tarak (Staz Nair), and resistance fighters Darrius Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) and Milius (E. Duffy). The first of two planned entries in a new franchise for Netflix makes for an accomplished visual spectacle, but the characters and scenarios are more predictable than likely intended. Much about Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire feels pulled directly out of the Star Wars universe. Technical innovations have improved the way new worlds can be brought to life in sci-fi and fantasy forays, and Rebel Moon packs some impressive sequences, costuming, effects, and general visual experiences. The problem comes more from the feeling that for all its technical prowess, the story lacks soul. You've seen it all before. Of course, the reality of franchise-driven Hollywood is that many audiences desire familiarity and predictability. Rather than the more mythical journeys of its obvious inspirations, like the Skywalkers or Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, Rebel Moon pulls its otherworldly characters down to our level and motivates them by basic human interests like childhood traumas, absentee families, and sexual desire. This certainly makes them easy to understand, but it also feels a little humdrum and less epic than the invented worlds and mega-production suggest. There's something very outdated as well in video game-inspired fight scenes and especially the macho posturing of soldiers, including attempted sexual aggressions. Families can talk about how Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire sets up a cast of characters and a story that can be carried on into future films. What do you expect to happen next in this story? What aspects of Veldt and other locations felt like Earth, and which didn't? What technical handiwork goes into creating new worlds and planets, like in Rebel Moon? How would you describe main character Kora's motivations? What about the other warriors she picks up along the way? Why do they all agree to help defend the village of Veldt?

"Jan 11, 2024"," There’s no joy to be found in hating a director’s entire body of work. On a long enough timeline and with strong enough scripts, any director can find their niche and produce a good film or two. This hope prevails in the hearts of optimists who, having seen glimmers of gold within the shit-mine that is Zack Snyder’s oeuvre, find themselves hoping that one day, he’ll make something truly excellent, even if it’s terribly dumb and full of gratuitous slow-motion. Largely shackled by comic book adaptations and franchises for the better part of the last 20 years (besides 2011’s Sucker Punch and 2021’s Army of the Dead and Army of Thieves, of course), the idea of Snyder doing his version of Star Wars felt promising. Perhaps, with just a little bit of grace, the much-maligned filmmaker could at last take all his stylistic quirks and urges and create a universe befitting the fawning adoration granted to him by internet movie bros. It’s cynical to say that “It’s the hope that kills you,” but in the case of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, it’s just too fitting. All films reveal something about their maker, and in the case of Rebel Moon, it reveals that the issue was never that Snyder was being held back by having to adapt the work of others. The reality is that the best parts of 300, Watchmen, and Dawn of the Dead only exist because Snyder was being kept on a leash. His disciples will argue that the comparative qualities of each so-called “Snyder Cut” of any of his films show a history of executive meddling ruining his vision, but really, his director’s cuts only serve to make lackluster films more Snyder-flavored, without making them good.  If you’ve seen Star Wars, Seven Samurai and A Bug’s Life, you don’t need to watch Rebel Moon. Snyder has been upfront about these inspirations in interviews, but despite the overwhelming obviousness of their influence, it’s hard to say whether Snyder or his co-writers (Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, whom he worked with on 300 and Army of the Dead and their sequels, respectively), understood what made those films work. We watch soldiers of an authoritarian empire land on the backwater moon of Veldt and do some textbook-evil stuff (beat an old man to death, try to rape a young woman, abuse their own robot helper, demand the farmers of Veldt give up all their crops), but their actions are too on-the-nose to be menacing. We watch our heroes, Kora (Sofia Boutella of The Mummy (2017) fame) and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, better known as Daario Naharis on Game of Thrones) slowly collect other rebels, but none of them are compelling enough for us to even remember their names or anything about them once the film changes focus to another planet and another rebel. This is the epitome of “tell, don’t show” sci-fi, where every character speaks in chunks of wooden exposition, every person and place thoroughly explained at other people, even if those people would already know everything being said. In one particularly egregious late-film scene, the villain of the film (and likely the series) rattles off facts about Kora to her face. This kind of thing happens repeatedly throughout the movie, making almost every interaction feel like a tedious slog. This is one of the easiest pitfalls of the space epic: You end up needing characters to deliver a lot of dialogue meant for the audience, not for the people in the film.  Essentially nothing about Rebel Moon works — even when the film stumbles onto something bordering on interesting character or environmental design, it’s undercut by just looking lifeless and sterile, even in natural settings. The one thing that Snyder should be able to do in his sleep — give us cool-looking fight sequences — instead feels like a joke played on the audience, a murky barrage of slow-mo and bland, toothless violence. Watching some comically evil Space Nazis get their brains blown out by a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins won’t change the fact that the Snyder we find on Rebel Moon couldn’t frame a shot to save his life, which is a death sentence for action scenes, and spells doom for smaller moments that happen outside our view for seemingly no reason. As the first installment of an (at least) two-part story, Rebel Moon feels like it devoted all its energy in setting up part two (The Scargiver, due out in April), but totally forgot that, typically, movies only get a sequel when enough people like the first film. Snyder’s clout and name recognition is enough that Part Two was essentially a foregone conclusion, and it’s clear that Snyder and his co-writers thought to themselves, “It’s fine! Part Two will be where all the really good stuff happens, once we know who everyone is!” The end result is a half-assed, half-baked, half-finished schlockfest that leaves you struggling to imagine anybody — even the most die-hard Snyder apologists — finding enough value in it to want to give away another two-plus hours of their precious lives to its sequel.

"Jan 10, 2024",Rebel Moon has potential&#44; but borrows too many elements from the films it&#8217;s inspired by&#46; Zack Snyder fans must once again wait for a future cut to fulfill the director&#8217;s true vision&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Jan 9, 2024"," While Zach Snyder’s (Army of the Dead, Watchmen, Dawn of the Dead) relationship with Warner Bros. officially ended with the release of Zack Snyder’s Justice League (i.e. the 2021 Snyder Cut), a certain subset of extremely online diehard fans have refused to let sleeping and/or comatose superheroes lie. With dimming fervour, the same fans have unrealistically pushed for Snyder’s return to a corporate-branded superhero franchise, refusing to take reality for an answer. Not coincidentally, Snyder’s incredibly ambitious franchise starter/wannabe, Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, will be released on streaming giant Netflix the same weekend as the final entry in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe), Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, arrives in movie theatres. Ambition is the key word here as Snyder, one of the premier visual stylists of the twenty-first century but also one of the least subtle, envisioned not just a world but a standalone universe of its own. One that would generate all manner of related properties, from spinoffs to direct sequels, a prequel here or there, and possibly even a series set somewhere within the boundaries of Snyder’s future-set space opera. Netflix seems to think so, too, since they’ve invested untold sums to allow Snyder to fulfill his vision. Though it’s certainly questionable whether they should have or—at a minimum—demanded more rigorous attention to screenplay quality and/or a more streamlined editing process aimed at coherent, compelling storytelling rather than what we ended up with here (i.e. the exact opposite). Much of that may be a direct result of Snyder and Netflix’s decision to release Rebel Moon as a two-part film (Part Two: The Scargiver is due next spring) but also as separate Snyder cuts for both halves, each one longer than the original by at least an hour. That length is presumably there to deepen character development, add missing exposition, and include Snyder’s favourite stylistic flavours (e.g. slow motion/speed ramping, etc.) and thematic preoccupations like the conflict between libertarian-leaning personal morality and authoritarian political structures, the responsibilities and duties of superheroic and ordinarily heroic characters thereof. That fight or flight response fuels Rebel Moon: Part One — The Child of Fire and its central character, Kora (Sofia Boutella), an ex-Imperium officer turned dirt farmer on the “rebel moon” of the title, Veidt. Saved from a mysterious crash two years earlier, Kora’s life took a turn for the better when she was welcomed by a romanticized, idealized pre-industrial, agrarian community. She has everything she could need, from a physically demanding, if otherwise fulfilling, life. She even has an occasional bedmate to satisfy her other physical needs. For Kora, it’s the first real home she’s had, the first home outside of the brutal, world-conquering military machine led by her surrogate father, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), a likely usurper to the centuries-old monarchy abruptly ended by an unseen assassin. As dictatorial, however, as Balisarius might be, he’s only slightly worse than the Roman-inspired monarchs he replaced. Each ruled through the force of arms and the threat of violence, using both to win (and lose) worlds across the galaxy. Kora’s brief peace doesn’t last long. When a fascist in a black tie, black suit, and a severe haircut appears one afternoon, newly disembarked from the Imperium Dreadnought circling overhead like a shark that hasn’t fed in weeks, it’s easy to surmise what HR reps the world over like to call “next steps:” The Imperium wants the grain from the next harvest in the 9-10 weeks, to murder a high-ranking member for the community in cold blood publicly, and leave a small contingent of ill-mannered, unprofessional soldiers to monitor the community’s progress over the next three months. The Imperium’s plans don’t remain in place for long, leaving Kora as the de facto leader and resistance organizer. In rapid, linear succession, Kora and her second-in-command, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), acquire the help or the promise of help from Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a black market smuggler, Tarak (Staz Nair), an ex-nobleman turned blacksmith’s assistance, Nemesis (Bae Doona), a double-sword carrying mercenary, Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced general turned gladiator, Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), the co-leader with his sister, Devra Bloodaxe (Cleopatra Coleman), of a resistance group large enough to get the Imperium’s attention. At various times, characters spontaneously bring up the words “rebellion,” “revolution,” and “insurgency” as if they’re interchangeable terms. They’re not. Far from it, but the mixed-use suggests more than muddled dialogue. It suggests muddled, unfocused storytelling by either a confused, bored, or even indifferent screenwriter or screenwriting team. Either that or somewhere in the cut, soon-to-be restored footage for the director’s cut, several characters sit down for a political discussion and iron out what they mean when they use those words in any relevant or possible context. Not surprisingly for an unoriginal, derivative work like Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire that takes inspiration or — less charitably — borrows freely without attribution, from highly popular, well-known 20th-century works of commercial art like Flash Gordon, the Foundation trilogy, Dune, and Star Wars (itself a product of many influences), before borrowing the premise wholesale from Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. (Roger Corman got here decades ago, releasing Battle Beyond the Stars four years after Star Wars broke box-office records around the world). In moderation, influences, callbacks/shout-outs, and fan service are fine, maybe even more than fine, but when those influences are always surface-deep and constantly call attention to themselves via narrative echoes, it’s a surefire way to ensure your audience is more engaged in spotting references and patting themselves on the back than caring about the sketchily developed characters onscreen or their individual and collective fates. And at least in this truncated iteration of Snyder’s latest franchise wannabe/starter, we don’t.

"Jan 7, 2024"," One of the best things I can say about director Zack Snyder‘s sci-fi space epic “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” is that at least it’s not totally unwatchable. It certainly is a total mess of a movie (which was supposedly inspired by “Star Wars,” Akira Kurosawa, and “Heavy Metal” magazine) that’s unfocused and lacking in all areas, from lame CGI effects and one-dimensional characters to mediocre performances and unsatisfying plot. Despite all of these serious flaws, I couldn’t stop watching. It’s not that I’m a total glutton for punishment, but that I inexplicably found myself invested in the lead character’s story arc. Set on the quiet edges of the galaxy, the hardworking inhabitants a peaceful farming colony are threatened by the tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a tough, mysterious stranger who lives among the villagers. Desperate for help, Kora is tasked with assembling a team of trained fighters and brave warriors to help make a stand against the Mother World. She searches for the best people she can find, which includes an unlikely group of outsiders that share a passion for revenge. The story takes a long time to get going and once it does, it’s a letdown. There’s a lot of traveling around the galaxy and meeting new characters that simply aren’t all that interesting. The only one with whom I developed any sort of emotional connection is Kora, with the others fading into the background. At least Snyder nails the villain department, as Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) embodies pure evil (which makes him a great bad guy). The film doesn’t look great either, with horribly mediocre CGI effects and bloodless, censored PG-13 action. Snyder pushes the boundaries of the rating with violence, but there’s no grisly aftermath. It’s not that the movie needs it to be enjoyable, but it does make it feel too sanitized. Dragging this story out into two parts is excessive, but hopefully the second installment will fare better. “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” is a drab, unexciting movie that’s only slightly better in quality than a “Star Wars” mockbuster.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 7, 2024"," For almost two decades, the director has stood at the fore of Hollywood barricades, enduring the slings and arrows of critics, toxic fans, journalists, personal tragedies, corporate suits and more. Through it all, the man had continued to make movies his way without the pandering increasingly common to directors of cinematic blockbusters. In other words, he is who he is, says what he wants to say, and doesn’t care what anybody thinks. His latest endeavor, Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire (Part One), finds Snyder relishing his love of science fiction and anime. As an original story, the pressures and expectations of executives and fans that so plagued his superhero outings do not encumber the arrival of the movie. On the other hand, some of Snyder displays some of his bad habits here, and the resulting film never quite makes the jump to lightspeed. In a distant galaxy, the Imperium, a militaristic dictatorship, rules over countless worlds with brutality and oppression. On the tiny farming moon of Veidt, Korra (Sofia Boutella), a former Imperium soldier, now lives a quiet life planting fields with her fellow villagers. When Imperium forces led by the nefarious Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) try to take control of Veidt, Korra and her friend Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set out on a planet-hopping mission to recruit mercenaries and anti-Imperium rebels in hopes of building a force to resist fascist aggression. Reading that summary, anyone with even a passing knowledge of American movies probably has a looming thought on their mind: Rebel Moon sounds a lot like Star Wars. Indeed, though Snyder has worked on the Rebel Moon story on and off for almost 40 years, he did pitch the concept to Lucasfilm as a possible Star Wars spin-off movie. The project has obvious parallels to the galaxy long ago and far, far away, and much as George Lucas did in 1977, Snyder and his co-writers, Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, construct Rebel Moon as a pastiche of beloved genre fare. The Seven Samurai, The Wizard of Oz, Space Battleship Yamato, Lord of the Rings, Alien, Blade Runner, the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Attack on Titan all get references here. Yet if Snyder wants Rebel Moon to have the same new-yet-familiar glow as Star Wars, he forgot to add the one key ingredient: beloved characters. Though Boutella has the right amount of grit, mystique, and cunning to make a great protagonist, and though the camera loves her angular face, Korra lacks the irrepressible personality that allows her to transcend her archetypal origins. Korra’s empathy and mysterious past will keep viewers rooting for her but won’t make an audience care about her. Other characters, including the enslaved prince Tarak (Staz Nair), the pilot Kai (Charlie Hunnam), the warriors Darrian and Devra (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman), and the evil Noble, get even less depth. They never feel like real characters, so much as placeholders in a story outline. Child of Fire lacks the kind of goofy humor or character banter that makes the characters in Star Wars or Star Trek so beloved. The biggest laugh here comes in the opening shot, as a phallic spaceship traverses a giant, pink opening in spacetime. Freud would have howled in the cinema. Two performers defy their restrictions: Doona Bae as the swordmaster Nemesis and Djimon Hounsou as Titus, an alcoholic general. Bae and Hounsou have the kind of magnetic charisma and personalities that make their characters vivid, even though both have little screen time or dialogue. Indeed, one of Child of Fire’s best sequences introduces Nemesis as she fights a child-eating spider woman (Jenna Malone). In their brief moments together, Child of Fire sparks with the kind of character drama that the rest of the movie lacks and hints at what might be the movie’s biggest problem. Snyder and Netflix have already announced that an R-rated, much longer version of Child of Fire will debut early in 2024 on the streaming service. Snyder, of course, loves releasing extended cuts of his films, as he did with Watchmen, Sucker Punch, and most notoriously, Justice League and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Critics maligned the latter when it arrived in theatres in one of the worst critical drubbings in recent memory. Yet, when Snyder released his “Ultimate Cut,” which reinserted 30 minutes of deleted scenes, a totally different, much more intriguing movie emerged. The longer version of Batman v. Superman has undergone something of a reevaluation since debuting its longer cut, earning accolades as a secret success. A Child of Fire seems to have the same problem. The second half of the movie jumps from one action sequence to another in rapid succession, adding characters along the way as it does. We suspect that the longer cut of the movie will reinsert considerable character drama and exploration, which can only help the story. The director should remember that no amount of slick visuals and action will engage an audience beyond the superficial if viewers don’t care about the characters. And A Child of Fire has plenty of visual flare. The aesthetic of the movie looks like an anime come to life, and several action sequences—including one of a space ship crashing into a station—have the edge-of-your-seat kind of suspense that makes an audience hold its collective breath. Or they would, if viewers cared more about the drama. Snyder has also developed a rich backstory to his universe, and scenes of aliens suckling at human hosts, androgynous soldiers marching to battle and space griffins soaring over extraterrestrial worlds have enough imagination to enthrall an audience. A Child of Fire is, in short, not as irredeemable as some of our fellow critics have insisted. Snyder again reminds viewers of his immense talent, even if the movie feels incomplete. Given that sequels, a TV series, and a continuation titled The Scaregiver (debuting in April) all follow the longer cut of A Child of Fire down the pipeline, it seems Snyder intends to flesh out his universe, and has much more to say about the world he has engineered. Here’s hoping next time he can use a complete sentence. Until then, audiences wanting a space opera with more than just visual splendor will need to wait for the extended edition.

"Jan 5, 2024"," For those who are sad about the sun setting on the DC era of the Snyder-verse, please do not fret, for those miss slow-motion battle scenes, unnecessary lens flares, and dark gritty unsympathetic characters who seem pissed off about saving mankind, Zach Snyder has brought forth his vision of the future with the science fiction saga Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire for all to enjoy. Depending on your definition of “enjoy.” At least, that was the intention. But it is doubtful that many will enjoy this wannabe Star Wars for much of anything other than one-star zingers on Letterboxd.  Conceived by Snyder decade ago, the original space saga is the story of Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former soldier-turned-member of a peaceful farming community on the planet Veldt whose livelihood is threatened by the tyrannical Imperium, led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who rule the Motherworld. To protect her people, she goes on a quest to gather warriors from different corners of the galaxy, with hopes of overthrowing the repressive regime.  This is an oversimplification of a perplexing, problematic story so jam-packed with mythos, exposition, and flashbacks that the central figures are given practically no time to develop into meaningful characters.  Rebel Moon is an aggressively mediocre space opera that is less of a coherent plot and more of an amalgamation of vignettes in which a grumpy galactic gunslinger gathers space hobos for her battle against celestial Nazis. With plot points seemingly cobbled together from Seven Samurai, The Dirty Dozen, Dune, and The Unforgiven, as well as a dozen or so other pop culture properties to come out in the last 50 years, Rebel Moon has little to offer in terms of originality. According to interviews, Snyder once had hopes for Rebel Moon to have a place in the Star Wars universe (at one point, a character makes use of non-Disney branded Lightsabers), but it omits the tenacity and thrills that the original trilogy is known and adored for.  Synder’s space opus not only lacks heart and humor, but it falls short on the fundamentals necessary for moviegoers to want to join a hero’s journey. In Star Wars, viewers watch Luke evolve from lonely farm boy into a protagonist. During that journey, they can see themselves in Luke as he transitions from chump to champ. In Rebel Moon, none of that growth exists on screen. The audience doesn’t experience the odyssey; they are just told about it in derivative flashbacks using half-baked characters who are just mildly amusing, at best.  Rebel Moon, overusing the trope to the point of parodying himself.  Rebel Moon combines complicated world building with shoddy characters and substandard storytelling to create a lackluster narrative. The shortage of humor, heart, and humanity lessens the basic necessities required to create a compelling narrative, resulting in an uninspired sci-fi tale. Somewhere in there might have been a riveting epic for the ages, but that story is buried deep in intergalactic nonsense where aspects of fun and joy are far, far away.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 4, 2024"," Subtlety, nuance and detail are absent from Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which is a shame, given that the film’s striking trailer gave us new hope for a science fiction franchise that could rival its obvious biggest influence, Star Wars. The first chapter of the two-part film, now available on Netflix, is entertaining enough given the nonsensical plot, chaotic pacing, flat characters and cliched dialogue. The story begins in a small farming village on an independent moon called Veldt. This is, of course, set in a distant galaxy ruled by a militaristic empire named Motherworld, whose royal family was recently assassinated in an attempted coup. The now reigning forces continue to rule the universe through violent conquests and war. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is one of the farmers on Veldt, with a mysterious past who has found a sense of purpose while living and working off the land. “I’m a child of war. To truly love and be loved … I don’t know if I’m capable of either,” Kora says in one of the first scenes of the film. In this early sequence, the audience is presented with the main emotional thread of the story: The real struggle Kora has to face is herself. When life in the village takes a dramatic turn, Kora’s existential journey begins. This could have been presented in a more compelling way than through expositional dialogue, which is present in almost every scene of the film, exhaustively explaining everything that's happening to the audience instead of leaving room for them to derive meaning through the story itself. Alas. Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a brutal military leader from Motherworld, arrives to Veldt, with his loyal troops in tow. Noble demands and threatens the village to sell him their grain, even if it means not having enough to feed themselves. In retaliation, Kora sets off through the galaxy with a farmer named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to gather a band of soldiers who will fight to bring down Noble and his army. Meanwhile, Noble and his military legion are aboard a colossal space vessel named The King’s Gaze, a frightening force that has wiped out whole planets and races. One must ask, why would their leader’s focus be on grain from a small, random village? This should come as no surprise given Snyder’s body of work, which includes 300, Watchmen and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. He is a director who prioritises contrasting colour and dramatic lighting to create mood while producing grand, theatrical compositions reminiscent of comics and graphic novels to captivate his audience. While sometimes a little too stylised, the cinematography, special effects and choreographed fight scenes are visually engaging, and do a lot of the world building on their own, particularly giving hints of the galaxy's history and mythology. This is exactly what we want to see in a space opera – epic scenes in outer space, where advanced technology, warfare and interstellar battles are melodramatic and all-consuming. These elements are well executed, but they need to make sense. Action needs to be anchored, otherwise it's just movement. There are many points at which it seems Snyder has attempted to do so, but he fails at every turn. In one sequence, Kora and Gunnar travel from one planet to the next to collect their band of outsiders, and she narrates her own history with the Motherworld and her connection to its current leader, Balisarius. These flashbacks, while visually appealing, are woven into the story in a manner that feels a little blunt and amateur. Information is added, but nothing is gained, a mistake Synder and his co-writers, Shay Hatten (John Wick: Chapter 3 and 4), Kurt Johnstad (Atomic Blond and 300), keep repeating throughout the film. Together, this creative team has crafted a set of characters who are interesting only on the surface. The details of how they look, act and dress is part of a larger world that does make one curious to learn more. But as soon as these characters open their mouths, there is nothing there but jargon and hackneyed one-liners. Things do, thankfully, pick up towards the end, which bodes well for the sequel heading to the platform in spring. There's a powerful plot twist towards the end, which ups the stakes of what the characters are fighting for. This was done, frustratingly enough, without telling us much about the characters themselves, making it hard to grab hold of. It’s natural to be inspired by other films or literature. The problem is how you use them. In this case, Synder never manages to take the elements that he admired from other films and mould them to fit his own aesthetic, and by extension, create a solid and distinct world. Instead, the stories and images that shaped him only serve to make his own world look undeveloped in comparison. Over and over again, the film presents many missed opportunities for audiences to engage on an emotional level with the characters' respective journeys, delivering instead all the basic assumptions of an “epic” space opera. Perhaps it’s a formula that works for many, since the film currently sits at number one on Netflix’s top 10 movie list in the UAE. But it takes more than beautiful images and expert fight choreography for a film to collate a massive fandom and become a long-lasting cultural staple, which this film is clearly intended for. And this is the film’s ultimate issue. In its desperation for epic moments, Rebel Moon forgets about the intimate ones, instead delivering microwave popcorn entertainment without much to feel, connect with or remember.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 4, 2024"," **** The trailers for American Fiction have been selling the feature as Bamboozled in the publishing industry, and while that’s certainly the crux of the story, it doesn’t get to the root of what makes the film compelling. Based on the novel Erasure by Percival Everett, the movie follows Thelonious “Monk” Ellison (Jeffrey Wright), a novelist pigeonholed into the African American studies genre. Looking to break out, Monk turns in an aggressively Black tale of criminality, drug addiction and absent fathers, which becomes a sensational hit despite his attempts at sabotage. Writer-director Cord Jefferson makes the most of the satirical premise, and there’s definitely some laughs to be had at the expense of would-be progressives who fetishize stories of Black suffering. However, the real meat of American Fiction is Monk’s personal relationships, particularly with his ailing mother (Leslie Uggams), self-destructing brother (Sterling K. Brown), and newfound paramour (Erika Alexander). It’s here that we understand the root of Monk’s issues and why he strives to set himself apart from what filmmaker Radha Blank once called “poverty porn.” All the actors shine, but Wright’s comedic chops and genuine heart hold the whole thing  together. He’s been a reliable character actor for years now, and seeing his long-overdue star turn is hugely gratifying. American Fiction may make some audiences uncomfortable, but its razor-sharp satire and engaging family drama make  it both a must-watch and a serious awards contender. R. MORGAN SHAUNETTE. Bridgeport, Cinema 21, Hollywood. *** Tracking the absences in Finnish auteur Aki Kaurismäki’s Fallen Leaves reveals a lot about this love story’s autumnal flavor. Set in present-day Helsinki (with constant reports of the Russian military bombing of Mariupol on the radio), Fallen Leaves contains almost no digital technology. There are no careers, only jobs. No forward momentum. No children. Hell, there’s no one younger than 40 in the film, save for a synthwave duo that plays at protagonist Holappa’s local bar one evening. (The passion in their music stirs in him only the sadness to have another drink.) Even so, Ansa (Alma Pöysti) is interested in Holappa (Jussi Vatanen). They’re two townies firmly in middle age, wrapping themselves in the stoicism of a hard day’s work (industrial cleaning and shelf-stocking) and lonely beds. The emptiness of their lives and their city makes them seem destined to connect, but with Helsinki’s understated harshness, what vulnerability is left? The filmmaking mimics the characters’ stiffness with long static shots while costuming Holappa and Ansa in monochromatic reds and greens, as if suggesting that emotionality has to live somewhere, if only in vibrant dyes. To this end, Kaurismäki cuts a few corners in the film’s 81-minute runtime, using folk and pop songs to loudly express what Holappa and Ansa might feel. The audience can really hear the music. Can the characters? NR. CHANCE SOLEM-PFEIFER. Living Room. *** Throughout the ‘80s and ‘90s, the question of whether or not it was “real” dominated coverage of American professional wrestling. Were the rivalries genuine? Were the matches scripted? Now, with the benefit of hindsight, we can recognize that not only was it always fixed, but that obsessing over that aspect obfuscated the very real controversies endemic to the WWE that claimed the lives of Jeep Swenson, Owen Hart, and much of the Von Erich family, whose story is dramatized in A24′s The Iron Claw. Writer-director Sean Durkin (Martha Marcy May Marlene, The Nest) keeps this in mind, shooting the wrestling scenes with kayfabe (pulled punches and choreographed grapples that make the sport look more childish than intense) in full effect. But he doesn’t shy away from the very real physical toll that wrestling and steroid abuse had on brothers Kevin (Zac Efron), Kerry (Jeremy Allen White), David (Harris Dickinson) and Mike (Stanley Simons) as they struggled to live up to the impossible standards of their domineering father, Fritz (Holt McCallany). Even knowing what tragedies befell the family doesn’t soften the blow as brother after brother is chewed up and spat out under Fritz’s reign. It’s harrowing to watch, particularly for Kevin, the only one with a support network outside the ring (thanks to his wife, Pam, played by Lily James). Leaving his High School Musical and The Greatest Showman days far behind, Efron manages to convey earnestness and heartbreak while looking like a He-Man doll come to life. The Iron Claw can be agonizing, but it’s a well-crafted tragedy that puts you in an emotional headlock and keeps you there till the bell rings. R. MORGAN SHAUNETTE.

His latest offering, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire, is derivative of previous films (notably Seven Samurai and Star Wars) and indefensible under close scrutiny, but it has sumptuous visuals and a game cast. Sofia Boutella leads the way as Kora, an ex-soldier living a quiet life on a farming planet. After a militaristic group called the Imperium shows up demanding shares of a harvest, Kora sets out to recruit warriors who will challenge them. A simple but entertaining sci-fi yarn that wears its influences on its sleeve, Rebel Moon includes everything from a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins to a blacksmith flying on the back of a griffin. Being the first half of a two-part film, this entry contains a lot of story setup and expository dialogue, but Snyder can’t help himself when it comes to action, filling the fights with speed ramping and slow motion. His detractors won’t find anything to change their minds about him here, but Rebel Moon offers enough enjoyment for others seeking easy escapism. PG-13. DANIEL RESTER.

If Ferrari is the 80-year-old directing icon’s final statement on that theme, it’s more haunted than ever by families broken and jobs well done. This snapshot biopic of Ferrari founder and patriarch Enzo (Adam Driver) finds the “Commendatore” (as his employees call him) at a low moment. It’s 1957. His company coffers are bare. His grief-stricken wife, Laura (Penélope Cruz), is fed up with his cheating, while his mistress (Shailene Woodley) has borne a secret heir to the Ferrari empire. The only antidote to this litany of human problems? Throw innovative aerodynamics and eager drivers into the meat grinder of the Mille Miglia. A win at this treacherous race, we’re told, would secure Enzo’s good fortunes. Ferrari is probably a better statement on Mann’s career than a standalone movie. Woodley and Cruz are cast in tough spots (with tough accents, too)—sad, angry women waiting to be recognized by an absent man—as the story roughly shifts gears from intimate drama to action that Enzo watches from the sidelines. Tougher still, liquid-looking visual effects mar the film’s most shocking moments. For both Michael Mann and Enzo, bodies of work overwhelm efforts. Boys and their toys to the last. R.

Shocker: We’re in the minds of director Yorgos Lanthimos and screenwriter Tony McNamara, the lurid stylists of The Favorite (2018). That film whipped up a soufflé of 18th century sexual intrigue, but Poor Things, based on Alasdair Gray’s novel, strides into Victorian England, where the automatonlike Bella is cared for/imprisoned by surgeon Dr. Godwin (Willem Dafoe) and his lackey Max (Ramy Youssef). Bella, jerky in movement and literal in speech, has a blunt innocence that inspires a wonderstruck Max to describe her as “a very pretty retard.” Few things betray shallowness of vision faster than a fetishization of the politically incorrect, but Lanthimos barrels on with his juvenile flourishes, blending Wes Andersonian whimsy with lame “witty” lines like, “Let us touch each other’s genital pieces!” By the time the director tacks on an extended homage to Freaks (1932), it’s excruciatingly clear that his affectations (monotone dialogue, steampunkish visuals) are a thin mask for his paucity of ideas. Only in the presence of Ruffalo, playing a sleazy and seductive lawyer, does the film vibrate with life. Adopting an English accent about as convincing as Spam packaged in a tin of Walker’s Shortbread, Ruffalo’s performance is the antidote to the artificial quirks of Poor Things. He’s so joyously fake that he’s scarily real. R. BENNETT CAMPBELL FERGUSON.

It’s generally understood that the tradition survives at prep academies and Ivy League institutions so that elites might legitimately dominate a team sport the poorer 99 percent consider too punishing, expensive and dull. But, as this new George Clooney-helmed passion project aches to prove, ‘twasn’t always so. Composed of orphaned scholarship cases, ex-trust funders dispossessed by the Depression, and semi-autistic amateur pianists, the ‘36 JV squad thrills a regatta-attending, newspaper-reading, under-entertained nation by winning boat races again and again (and again-—at the Berlin Olympics!). This, aside from some wispy flirtations thrust upon a coxswain (Callum Turner) living in his car and guest cameos by Jesse Owens and Hitler, is the film in its entirety. (To be fair, we’re also taught best practices: Keep the oars pointed in the same direction and exploit desperate strength born of generational poverty.) Even Angelina Jolie’s Unbroken, another entry in the microgenre of New Deal-era athlete biopics directed by Oscar-winning heartthrobs, employed Louis Zamperini’s trip to the Berlin games as a mere prelude for wartime ruminations on eroticized torture. The appeal of lads propelled forward through laborious craft is obvious, but The Boys in the Boat fails to do more than skim the surface both literally and metaphorically. PG-13. JAY HORTON.

"Jan 2, 2024"," I’ve long been of the opinion that Zack Snyder does his best work when he’s adapting someone else’s writing. Films like 300 or Dawn of the Dead work well because they suit his admittedly remarkable visual creativity but are not bogged down by his sometimes-shoddy storytelling. Snyder often has grand vision while also lacking the storytelling acumen to follow through on it, which is how we get messy projects like Batman V. Superman and Army of the Dead. These issues are thrust to the forefront of his newest epic idea, the space opera Rebel Moon, recently released via Netflix. Rebel Moon purports to be a far-flung, wild odyssey of a band of diverse heroes in a fictional universe fighting against the tyranny of The Motherworld. The story centers on Kora (capably portrayed by Sofia Boutella), a former soldier of the Motherworld who fled its grasp to try to find peace on the quiet planet of Veldt. Of course, the forces of the Motherworld — led by the sneering, vicious (yet oddly charming at times) Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) come to this quiet little farming planet, seeking conquest and subjugation. In response, Kora begins a quest to find a collection of warriors to bring back to Veldt to help them defend themselves against Noble and his forces. What follows is a curious collection of recruitment missions, with Kora traipsing about the galaxy with a fellow farmer (Michael Huisman) and a recruited renegade pilot named Kai (Charlie Hunnam). Over time, they are joined by a lethal cyborg assassin (Doona Bae), a retired general and gladiator named Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a rebel leader named — hilariously — Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and a mysterious animal whisperer/blacksmith (Staz Nair). This collective eventually faces off against the Motherworld’s forces, setting the stage for the second film to be released in April 2024. Rebel Moon is a fascinating discussion point. It is, despite its proponents’ claims, hardly an original story. True, there are few original stories in science fiction anymore, and often stories will borrow from other sagas. It’s hardly an unusual practice. However, rarely does one borrow so heavily and so ham-fistedly as Snyder does here. Rebel Moon blurs that line between homage and copycatting clumsily, and it makes for distracting storytelling. This peculiar mashup of The Magnificent Seven (or Seven Samurai if you’re a purist), Star Wars, Mass Effect, and a half-dozen other stories is so obvious as to make it distracting. The film barely conceals its inspirations/source material, and it suffers for it.  It’s not helped by the fact that the film, despite its 134-minute runtime, still manages to feel rushed. There’s little time to understand the motivations of its characters, let alone get to know them since each recruitment is a ten-minute vignette that feels jammed in there just to get the story rolling. It’s awkward and jarring and throws the pacing of the film off completely. Of course, this will theoretically be resolved with the inevitable (and publicized) release of a director’s cut, but there’s no guarantee that expanding upon these issues will actually improve them. That’s not even covering the fact that deliberately cutting a movie down with the intent of re-releasing its full version later is such a commercially crass plan in the first place (and a clear-cut case of Netflix trying to capitalize on the success of Snyder’s Justice League Snydercut shenanigans).
Where the film often does succeed is in its visual flair and Snyder’s gift for action choreography. While he still over-relies on slow-motion, he continues to impress with how he assembles an action scene, with flawless lighting and solid effects work combined with top-notch direction. And for what it’s worth, the actors mostly do well with what little they’re often given. Boutella, whose dancer background gives her a natural physicality, holds her own here as a star in a film filled with other more well-known names, and her costars both perform well while also giving her breathing room. It’s a nicely rounded cast, even if they’re stuck with some often derivative and stilted dialogue. It’s with all this said that it becomes hard to say whether Rebel Moon is a good or bad film. On the one hand, how do you judge a film that does some things well, but that’s literally being released incomplete? On the other hand, there’s no denying its failures in writing and originality, and those are things that cannot be remedied in its future cut. Even more puzzling is why Netflix chose to do things this way. They’ve obviously invested serious money in the project — why not simply turn it into an episodic project and give the story room to grow more organically instead of this weirdly bumpy film that feels as hastily assembled as its team of heroes? It’s puzzling. At the end of the day, Rebel Moon (technically, it’s Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire but who has time to keep typing that out) isn’t a terrible film — certainly not worth the drubbing it’s been receiving. But there are so many parts of it that struggle to work cohesively, so many square pegs hammered into round holes, that it becomes difficult to call it good, either. Perhaps a director’s cut will serve it well, even if that very concept is infuriating in this context. Perhaps it will expand upon its flaws and expose them further. What is clear is that regardless, Rebel Moon is a visually arresting, occasionally exciting film that borrows far too heavily from its predecessors to truly be called an original Snyder project and suffers far too much from some strange combination of ego and greed to even be viewed on its own merits. Maybe you should just wait for the directors cut … but then again, maybe that won’t help at all. Only time will tell.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 2, 2024"," La vida en la comunidad agrícola del planeta Veidt es sencilla pero satisfactoria. Bajo el liderazgo de Sindri (Corey Stoll), los hombres y mujeres trabajan incansablemente para labrar la tierra árida. Pero esto cambia cuando un día Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) llega con un ejército. La mano derecha del dictador Balisarius (Fra Fee), que gobierna el Mundo Madre con mano de hierro, busca rebeldes que se atrevan a enfrentarse al imperio. Se supone que el pueblo debe proporcionar suficiente comida al ejército. Cuando Sindri intenta rechazar esta petición, estalla un enfrentamiento violento. Ahora depende de Kora (Sofia Boutella), que vino a Veidt hace algún tiempo, y Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) detener el desastre. Encuentran el apoyo del piloto Kai (Charlie Hunnam) y de algunos otros que no hablan bien del Imperio. Los fanáticos de Star Wars  están pasando por momentos difíciles en este momento, al menos cuando se trata de aventuras en la pantalla grande. No ha habido una película desde el desastroso ""El ascenso de Skywalker” hace cuatro años. Posteriormente se planearon varios otros títulos. Pero han sido cancelados, están atrapados en el infierno del desarrollo o simplemente han desaparecido de la faz de la tierra. Así que en realidad es bueno que Rebel Moon - Part 1: Child of Fire sea una película que está claramente basada en la famosa saga. De hecho, Zack Snyder intentó vender su historia como parte oficial de Star War en su momento, pero fue rechazada por Disney. Warner tampoco estaba interesado, a pesar de que el estudio trabajó mucho con Snyder a través de las películas de DC Comics. Sólo muchos años después todo el asunto llegó al servicio de streaming en cuestión. Zack Snyder se toma su tiempo para presentar a la comunidad agrícola. Aquí no sucede mucho, muchos de los diálogos son bastante planos o solo sirven para brindar exposición. Pero a estas alturas todavía tienes la sensación de que todo esto es sólo el preludio de una gran aventura. Sin embargo, la apertura de la reunión en el bar es claramente la mejor parte de la película. Porque en cuanto comienza la reunión de aliados, al estilo de ""Los siete samuráis"", ""Rebel Moon"" se vuelve aburrida durante largos periodos. Esto también tiene que ver con las figuras intercambiables que cobran protagonismo a partir de ahora. Todos los personajes previamente establecidos –excepto Kora y Gunnar– y sus conflictos desaparecen. Hay, por ejemplo, un joven soldado imperial que también parece tener un lado bueno y muestra remordimiento. De repente desaparece, y esa es más la regla que la excepción en esta película: si alguien es excitante o siente cierta fascinación (como el ex robot de combate ""Jimmy"", cuya brillante voz fue interpretada por Anthony Hopkins en la versión original en inglés) , entonces eso es todo. Demasiado pronto tendrá que dejar paso al equipo de los ""Siete Samuráis"", en gran parte reemplazable. Aunque los siete samuráis espaciales de la versión original en inglés a veces hablan con acentos absurdos (pero no siempre los mantienen), con excepción de Gunnar, ninguno de ellos se convierte en personajes de carne y hueso. Es significativo que antes del gran enfrentamiento, poco antes del final se dedique una secuencia completa a explicarnos quiénes son realmente todas estas personas y qué motivaciones tienen para participar en esta aventura. Esto es muy necesario porque, a pesar de nuestro viaje anterior juntos, no entendimos casi ninguno de ellos. Ya sea Kai, el musculoso Tarak (Staiz Nair), el luchador con sable láser Nemesis (Doona Bae), el ex general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) , que simplemente es etiquetado como ""genio"", o el líder rebelde Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) - todos siguen siendo completamente irrelevantes. Esto también reduce el impacto del final, en el que de repente se supone que debes apoyarlos mientras enfrentan heroicamente una posible muerte. La acción, que Snyder, por supuesto, ideó nuevamente con su confidente cercano y experto en acrobacias personales Damon Caro, no hace mucho para que los eventos de ""Rebel Moon"" sean más emocionantes. Hay momentos breves que destacan: un movimiento hábil, un genial golpe con la espada o cómo Snyder ilustra el increíble poder de penetración de las armas de fuego en un largo flashback en el que el misterio del pasado de Kora se revela sorprendentemente desde el principio. Pero la mayor parte de la acción carece de potencia y energía, al menos en la versión que ahora se lanza por primera vez en Netflix. Por supuesto, esta accidentada historia no da muchas esperanzas de que el resultado sea excelente. Además, la participación de Snyder en películas de superhéroes terminó sin gloria. Pero hay que dejar atrás una cosa: aunque rara vez tenían algo bueno, eran claramente mejores que el monstruo de ciencia ficción que aquí se desata sobre el público. La primera irritación es cuánto se copia la situación original de Una nueva esperanza . ¿Un imperio malvado que gobierna la galaxia y tiene tendencias fascistas? ¿Un planeta remoto, sin importancia y lleno de agricultores donde comienza la aventura? ¿Una escena en un bar lleno de extrañas criaturas? ¿Un robot parlante? ¿Un piloto al que le gusta trabajar al borde de la ilegalidad? Todo esto es muy atrevido. Más tarde, Snyder rompe con este modelo y descubre otro. Toda la parte central consta de Kora, Gunnar y Kai volando por el espacio en busca de compañeros de armas. Al final terminas con un equipo de siete -por casualidad, por supuesto- tal como lo hicieron Los Siete Samuráis y Los Siete Magníficos . Es discutible si es mejor robar descaradamente dos películas en lugar de solo una. De cualquier manera, con Rebel Moon – Parte 1: Child of Fire esperas  mucho tiempo para ver tu propia idea. En cambio, hay dos horas y media de citas. Incluso como un fanfiction anónimo en Internet, esto habría sido una vergüenza. Esto es inaceptable para una película increíblemente cara. Ahora bien, existe el conocido dicho: más vale robar que mal inventar. Puede que sea cierto: no todas las películas tienen por qué ofrecer algo completamente nuevo. Es que esto no se roba bien. De hecho, no sabes qué es peor: la total falta de visión propia o la pésima implementación. Lo malo, por ejemplo, es que las distintas personas que se reúnen en torno al dúo inicial no tienen ninguna posibilidad de convertirse en un personaje. Hay una escena introductoria para cada uno, después de la cual no tienen mucho que hacer. Lo que es molesto, por ejemplo, es cómo se presenta a Tarak (Nair ) en Rebel Moon - Parte 1: Child of Fire  como alguien que tiene una gran empatía hacia los animales. Inmediatamente después, sin embargo, aplaude a la maestra de espada Némesis (Bae) cuando mata a una mujer araña que intenta proteger a sus hijos de los humanos. Si vas a dibujar las figuras tan finamente, al menos hazlo de manera consistente. Y luego está la acción. Es bien sabido que Synder tiene una inexplicable obsesión por las escenas en cámara lenta, como ha demostrado hasta la saciedad en otras películas. Las cosas se ponen tan mal aquí que a veces uno se pregunta si no querrá parodiar sus propias obras. Está hecho de manera tan cruda y genial, pero tan repetitivo y carente de dinámica que simplemente verlo se convierte en una tortura. Rebel Moon - Parte 1: Child of Fire mejora un poco cuando la película no intenta transmitir ningún contenido o acción, sino que simplemente muestra paisajes. Tampoco son demasiado creativos y obviamente se crean en la computadora, pero son bastante agradables. Sin embargo, eso por sí solo difícilmente justifica tener que hacer todo el resto. Si tan solo todo fuera al menos de alguna manera divertido, como las escenas involuntariamente divertidas con Ed Skrein, que aquí cede por completo a la sobreactuación. Pero ni siquiera eso: la excursión a nuevos mundos termina en un aterrizaje forzoso en el que se desperdició mucho dinero, talento y tiempo. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"Jan 1, 2024"," Andrew Haigh, the director of Weekend and 45 Years, has made an emotionally powerful film that represents a contemporary queer take on Field of Dreams. After all, it isn’t only heterosexual boomer farmers from Iowa who would love the chance to interact and settle all their issues, with their long-dead parents.  Based on a Japanese novel called Strangers, the film stars Andrew Scott (from Fleabag) as a lonely writer named Adam who lives in a gleaming but mysteriously empty apartment complex in London. One day he meets a neighbor named Harry (Paul Mescal) and they fall into a passionate affair. At the same time, Adam suddenly gains the ability to visit his childhood home and interact with the ghosts of his parents (Jamie Bell and Claire Foy), who were killed in a crash when he was 12 years old.  He essentially speed-runs the experience of connecting with them and coming out to them — while explaining that life for gay people has changed a lot since they died in the late 1980s. He eventually comes to terms with their deaths- only doing so as an adult rather than as a child. It’s all very affecting and beautifully rendered- and, I gather, Haigh shot the scenes in his own childhood home.  It’s yet another Searchlight Pictures movie that feels like an A24 movie, and fans of last year’s Aftersun will be gladdened to know that Paul Mescal dancing in a club is once again an important part of the film.  There are going to be many, many arguments about the ending, both what it means and whether or not it “ruins” the movie. I think it works, but the arguments it’s going to start are half the fun.  Michael Mann has returned with his first film since Blackhat eight years ago. It’s a tightly focused biopic of Italian car impresario Enzo Ferrari, played this time by Adam Driver.  It’s a compelling movie, certainly, Mann’s best since Miami Vice back in 2006, although (pardon the pun) it never finds that extra gear. Ford v. Ferrari, from back in 2019 but set a decade after this film’s events — but also featuring a Big Race at the End — was a better version of a similar idea.  The film is set in 1957 and focuses on a specific moment: Still grieving his recently deceased son, Enzo Ferrari is presiding over the Mille Miglia race, while also considering selling a stake in his company. He’s also juggling his wife Laura (Penelope Cruz) and a mistress Lina (Shailene Woodley). Laura, at least nominally, is all right with the mistresses, both less all right with her husband having a secret son.  Yes, this is the second movie in the past three years in which Adam Driver plays the head of a famous Italian corporation and has sex with a woman on a table. It recalls Driver’s 2019 parlay of Marriage Story and The Report, both of which featured scenes in which a lawyer tells Driver’s character he has to pay a retainer that he’ll never be able to afford.  I had no trouble buying Driver as an Italian but had a bit more trouble buying the 40-year-old actor as a man who was about 20 years older than that at the time. And while Cruz can do anything, I had much more trouble buying Woodley as an Italian.  George Clooney, as a director, made an above-average movie right out of the gate with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and followed it up with a near-masterpiece in Good Night and Good Luck. Since then, it’s been nothing but duds. It’s almost impressive, honestly.  No, it’s not as bad as Suburbicon or Leatherheads, but Clooney’s latest film, The Boys in the Boat, is a completely perfunctory underdog sports movie that embraces every single cliche of the genre.  Based on a popular book of the same name, The Boys in the Boat is about a rowing team from the University of Washington, in the 1930s, who got to compete at the Olympics in 1936- you know, the ones in Berlin that were presided over by Hitler.  The story is just told in the most uninteresting way possible, with the rowers all played by Generic Handsome Actors. When the characters meet Jesse Owens, it made me wish I was watching a movie about him, instead.  I can think of three different movies off the top of my head that were set at the 1936 Olympics and were better than this one-  even the one directed by Leni Riefenstahl that was pure Nazi propaganda.  I’m kind of getting sick of “it’ll all make sense once you see the forthcoming director’s cut that’s an hour longer” being used as a defense of movies that I didn’t like. I didn’t buy that when it was about Napoleon, either.  That’s the case here with Zack Snyder’s latest spectacle, now on Netflix. which lifts all sorts of aspects of Star Wars, from its stated Kurosawa influence to actual red light sabers. It’s so Star Wars-inspired that it even officially began life as a Star Wars movie that Snyder wanted to make at one point.  I made my peace with the Snyder Cut and even kind of liked it, though I’m not about to justify that fanboy toxicity that went on for several years. Snyder has clear passion and talent, but this one is a dud- way too plagued by mumbo jumbo. Part II is coming in April, but I don’t expect to remember much about Part I a week from now, much less in four months. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 31, 2023"," Let’s start with the good news.  Rebel Moon is cinematically amazing with insane makeup, costumes, production design enhanced by strong grounded performances, stunts and fight scenes led by Sofia Boutella, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Ray Fisher, Djimon Hounsou and Charlie Hunnam. The first 40 minutes circle around an epic science-fantasy event where this peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by armies of a tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival. Tasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Mother World, Kora assembles a small band of warriors, outsiders, insurgents, peasants and orphans of war from different worlds who share a common need for redemption and revenge. As the shadow of an entire Realm bears down on the unlikeliest of moons, a battle over the fate of a galaxy is waged, and in the process, a new army of heroes is formed.That’s a lot right? If you think that description is a lot to read imagine watching this film knowing there is a part two. At first glance, this epic adventure starts out both barrels blazing Listen, I love sci-fi and I especially love the Star Wars universe.  Rebel Moon: Part One: A Child of Fire replicates all that is familiar and worked immensely well for that Disney franchise.  It boasts  fabulous fight scenes that are synonymous with Zach Snyder’s style and brand of filmmaking.  There is never a dull action moment and leading lady Sofia Boutella as Kora holds her own while holding down the film. Having said that, a few of the fight scenes could have been cut a bit short as could the entire film whose running time clocks in around 133 minutes.  While I enjoying having a woman lead the charge in a franchise of film usually reserved for male characters, the overall pacing is uneven making this film a chore in some spots.  It’s crystal clear that George Lucas’ Star Wars has had some major impact on Snyder’s filmmaking prowess, which isn’t a bad thing and would be great if it took it up a notch – which it does not.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 31, 2023"," El nuevo proyecto del director de Watchmen (2009) y Batman v Superman (2016) es la combinación de docenas de universos mayores, que el cineasta utiliza a discreción y sin ninguna solidez. Sensiblera, cursi y llena de problemas narrativos, es unaobra pobre y extraña que desmerece la sublimación de la space opera que intenta ser. Rebel Moon Parte 1, la esperada película de Zack Snyder, comienza con una narración genérica acerca de una guerra entre mundos y la descripción, a grandes rasgos, de una mitología mayor. También, con la exploración superficial — como todo en el argumento escrito por Snyder, Shay Hatten y Kurt Johnstad — de la vida de un planeta a la periferia de las grandes luchas, másparecido a un descampado que a un futuro núcleo de una rebelión. Si todo lo anterior resulta familiar, es porque lo es. El director, que a menudo ha admitido que toma ideas y propuestas mayores de otras sagas, tomó la decisión de crear un relato a su medida. Pero eso, a partir de otras tantas franquicias e historias cinematográficas. Todas unidas y recombinadas, de forma endeble y poco convincente en la primera parte de lo que se anuncia como una duología. Pero quizás, el mayor error de Rebel Moon en su conjunto es que su relato avance específicamente sobre la promesa de que, en el futuro, lo que propone se completará. En el mejor de los casos, se profundizará en sus aproximaciones con cuidado. Sin embargo, por ahora, no hay tiempo. La gran sensación que deja a su paso la cinta es que todos los puntos que toca, apenasmuestran su valor y sentido. Que cada personaje — y hay docenas, de todos los lugares y especies imaginables — tendrá una segunda oportunidad para volver sobre su historia. Pero, mientras tanto, la película apenas presta atención a cualquiera de ellos. Poco a poco, lo que comienza como una propuesta pequeña — y que podría funcionar desde sus límites muy precisos — se expande sin que la historia siga su rápida evolución. Del planeta colonia, tomado rehén por una facción del llamado Planeta Madre (que cumple la misma función, en peso e importancia, que el Imperio intergaláctico de George Lucas), la película avanza hacia diversos frentes. El esencial a tener en cuenta: la búsqueda de un equipo de guerreros rebeldes que permitan al grupo de pacíficos campesinos, enfrentar un ataque mayor.  Pero el guion es tan torpe y la mezcla de elementos tan disparatada, que la historia avanza a tropezones entre docenas de escenarios distintos. Todos, tomados de otras narraciones mejores y más profundas. Kora (Sofia Boutella), líder accidental en busca de refuerzos, debe encontrar a Kai (Charlie Hunnam), el Han Solo de esta historia. Después, recorrer algunos mundos genéricos en busca del resto del equipo y volver, para enfrentar el mal que amenaza el cosmos. Mientras todo lo anterior sucede, la trama no presta la menor atención a sus héroes. Cada personaje parece parte de un estereotipo mayor, descrito sin mucho interés. Pero lo más lamentable es la falta de exploración del largometraje en todo lo que propone. Los símbolos se acumulan escena a escena, solo para ser mostrados a medias u olvidados casi de inmediato. Loque resulta aún peor: convertirse en una mezcla poco afortunada de líneas de discurso huérfanas. La narrativa de Rebel Moon es tan pobre, como para encontrarse sumido en una torpeza que aumenta secuencia a secuencia. Un villano maligno trajeado como un nazi, un bar galáctico tan parecido a los mostrados en Star Wars que resulta paródicos. Luchas y batallas cuerpo a cuerpo, ralentizadas para mayor gloria de cuerpos perfectos y pechos desnudos masculinos.  Rebel Moon parece acumular todos los vicios de Zack Snyder en un solo lugar. Sublimarlos y volverlos cada vez más extraños. Estereotipos vacíos que delinean una historia tan ambiciosa que se anuncia como el preludio de cientos de relatos, que se ampliarán antes o después. Solo que no se hace ahora y la película se desploma con la misma rapidez que su premisafacilona.  De Star Wars a la franquicia Harry Potter, franquicia de la que toma una escena central y la copia casi cuadro a cuadro. Zack Snyder no se sonroja al imitar con pulso torpe una serie de referentes que descompone en alegorías que rozan con demasiada frecuencia lo ridículo y lo sensiblero. Todo, para, al final, la película quedarse a medias, sostenida con fragilidad sobre la posibilidad que cada cosa mal construida se desarrolle mejor en adelante.  Pero Rebel Moon necesita más que una secuela — que se estrenará en abril — para sostener su discurso vacío, su simbología cursi y el mal uso de sus propuestas. Incluso la fotografía — plana, con aspecto de efectos especiales de segunda y lleno de errores de iluminación — desmerece el esfuerzo en conjunto que este universo intenta sostener sin lograrlo. Al final, la anunciada space opera de Zack Snyder no es otra cosa que una versión tardía, de mal gusto y blanda, de conceptos superiores.

"Dec 31, 2023"," Netflix’s new and flashy sci-fi epic, spearheaded by the internet’s favorite misunderstood (or, in many cases, controversial) visionary director, Zack Snyder, is really not that bad. Taking on the additional role of director of photography, Snyder unleashes his penchant for capturing his favored subjects — strong men and women exuding mythical strength and unwavering physical prowess — all of them filling the frames with his rapturous visual signature.  There are some really, and I mean really, intense slow motion scenes in this film — and I kind of dig them. This is Snyder unimpeached and unshackled, and this is probably a good thing. These are the auteur gambles that companies like Netflix should take along with funding the David Finchers and Bradley Coopers of the world. And they’re putting a lot of investment into this project, especially considering that the second part will release next year in April, essentially giving Snyder the time and space for his vision. Snyder’s deep appreciation for the classics that shaped his filmmaking sensibilities shows here. Rebel Moon draws inspiration from the timeless story of a small village confronting a powerful group of adversaries prevalent in Seven Samurai, as well as the antique yet futuristic wilderness found in the richly detailed and lived-in environments of Star Wars.  Snyder stacks these cinematic influences on top of each other and creates something that can become excessively familiar, yet in the instances where the film differs from what came before, it can become a tad bit thrilling. Take for example the barrage of action scenes with hard-hitting sound design and feverishly choreographed ballets that are heart-pumping to watch; it’s a style that I doubt many filmmakers can replicate.  But what I do find easily replicable is the film’s story structure, dialogue, and character archetypes. Excluding a somewhat interesting twist near the end of the film, there really is nothing new to offer that hasn’t already been seen before but in a different skin. What I argue Snyder contributes to this genre is birthing a piece of media that actually acts more like a video game than film, and I honestly think that could be a good thing for some, and undoubtedly boring for others. Surprisingly, I’m in the former camp. Unlike some video game adaptations that try their hardest to replicate the interactive gameplay feel of their originals, Rebel Moon: Part One manages to do this effortlessly. Maybe it’s the slow motion, the obviously demarcated scenes of dialogue that become trojan horses for backstory, or the pitch perfect renderings of nameless thugs who you can beat with one fell swoop. It’s a two-hour cutscene full of mesmerizing gameplay first and storytelling second. As a film, Rebel Moon is already working at a disadvantage, but as a video game, this could have easily been a triple A title. I felt this the same way with Snyder’s earlier work, Sucker Punch. Just look at the plot summary and see how unoriginal it is — but if rendered for a video game, could actually pass off as a decent enough PlayStation exclusive. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a resident of a peaceful agricultural village suddenly ravaged by a savage military army. Having had a secret history of combat and wartime experience, she emerges as the last bastion of hope for their survival.  Entrusted with the formidable task of rallying skilled fighters to stand against the oppressive Imperium, Kora assembles a disparate group of warriors from diverse worlds, united by a shared quest for redemption and revenge. Sounds like the plot of A Bug’s Life? Well, it is. All of those films, from Star Wars to Mad Max: Fury Road, owe a cinematic debt to Akira Kurosawa’s monumental 1954 masterpiece, Seven Samurai. Now, imagine if Netflix had instead poured millions of dollars into a God of War-esque action-adventure or a Battlefront first-person shooter clone, but under the same world as Rebel Moon. While the narrative might certainly still appear repetitive, it won’t matter as soon as it gets submerged beneath waves of mindless, yet enthralling, action gameplay. I think that kind of recontextualization is how to best appreciate Zack Snyder’s filmography.  For example, his slow-motion theatrics may not always translate seamlessly to Rebel Moon, but it would be glorious to see them emerge after pressing both triangle and circle on your controller. Explaining the entire film lore through a robot might seem overwhelming within a two-hour runtime, but it becomes a mere droplet in comparison to the 30-plus hours that gaming anticipates you to invest. Even Snyder’s inclination for extended director’s cuts aligns more cohesively with the medium, given its expectation for breaks. Video games allow the story to simmer in your mind and permit you to approach it at your own pace. Even secondary characters such as Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus and Bae Doona’s Nemesis could have thrived with optional backstory footnotes — a frequent feature in video games where extensive character backgrounds are condensed into notes, scrolls, or stone carvings for gamers to explore if they desire a deeper understanding of these characters. In the film, there’s simply not enough time to fully acquaint oneself with Titus, Kai, or the villainous Admiral Atticus (depicted with a notable touch of spice by Ed Skrein). It’s also a bit frustrating that this film, already dedicated to setting up who our warriors are, barely has any of the warriors in it. Part two is still tasked with a substantial amount of heavy lifting, needing to further endear us to the characters, humanize the villagers in need of saving, and elevate the stakes for what looks to be a galaxy-wide resistance on top of its small-scale war. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 31, 2023"," One of the worst things a movie can be is boring. The boredom can be heightened when the genre has a typical energy to it, mainly science fiction or horror, two genres that often naturally have a zest that captures my attention. Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire is a shocking kind of boring. The newest film from embattled director Zack Snyder is a rejected Star Wars project, adding in some of his standard signature tropes, but failing to elevate beyond something rote and derivative. Rebel Moon- Part One delivers little reason to look forward to Part Two. The film opens with a long-winded monologue by Anthony Hopkins, talking about a place called the Motherworld, where the ruler was killed and a group of space Nazis is in power, looking to control all the planets in the galaxy. The first setting is the farming planet of Veldt. We meet Kora (Sofia Boutella), a one-time soldier of the Motherworld, looking for peace in the simple village. When admiral Atticus Nobel (Ed Skrein) and his goons arrive, things become volatile, with Kora revealing her assassin skills, and escaping with grain manager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman). They go in search of a team to fight against the fascist regime. It’s The Seven Samurai in outer space or any other science fiction-western combo you have seen before. Going forward, the narrative is a redundant sequence of introducing us to new characters to join Kora’s team, including Han Solo replica Kai (played by Charlie Hunnam), a griffin tamer named Tarak (Staz Nair), a lightsaber-wielding swordsman named Nemesis (Bae Doona), and a once-beloved war general Titus (Djimon Hounsou in a role far beneath him). By the time the entire team is gathered, it’s hard not to be tuned out, as Snyder, along with co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten think character mugging for the camera, odd-looking space creatures, and little bursts of action are enough to engage us. Sadly, it’s dull and mundane by all science fiction standards. Even as Zach Snyder has had his fair share of highs and lows, Rebel Moon may be his lowest, both from a story and action angle. There is not a single set piece to praise nor a character to appreciate. Boutella is not charismatic enough to lead and her dialogue reading is stiffer than a board. The blame isn’t solely on her, as from a visual aspect, the CGI is distracting, and there is not a single setting outside a studio lot. The highest marks I can give are to Skrien, who has a hideous haircut and performs for the back row, and a lone sequence where Jena Malone plays a venomous spider who is gnarly enough to be amused by. That’s about all I have. Rebel Moon- Part One: A Child of Fire is a misfire of epic proportions. Where Army of the Dead was a fresh riff on zombies and Snyder’s Justice League showed his complete vision, Rebel Moon is none of that. It’s not hindered by Snyder’s style, which tends to be dragged down by his joy of slow-motion, but instead is ruined by an unoriginal and unimaginative production. It’s boring and cliched. It can’t be saved by a SnyderCut version because this is Netflix and an excuse like that just won’t work. Rebel Moon is completely lost in space.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 31, 2023"," “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” representa el más reciente intento por Zack Snyder de desarrollar un universo cinematográfico —no en el cine (como cuando estuvo haciendo películas para DC), si no más bien para Netflix (como cuando estrenó “El ejército de los muertos” hace un par de años). El problema es que, en vez de crear algo original o siquiera relativamente novedoso, todo lo que ha hecho es agarrar un guion que originalmente se iba a llevar a cabo en el universo “Star Wars”, y cambiar algunos nombres. No es una exageración decir que “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” se parece MUCHÍSIMO a “Star Wars”, tanto así que Lucasfilm debería considerar tomar acciones legales. Díganme, si no, si es que la trama no les suena familiar. En un planeta remoto, una granjera llamada Kora (Sofía Boutella) se da cuenta de que debe reaccionar ante la crueldad del Imperium, representado por el sádico Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) cuando este llega a su pueblo y comienza a abusar de medio mundo. Es así que decide escapar junto a su compañero Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) para reclutar a otros guerreros que los puedan ayudar. Primero llegan a un exótico bar lleno de Aliens donde conocen al rebelde Kai (Charlie Hunnam), y luego salen del planeta para encontrar al legendario General Titus (Djimon Hoynsou), a la honorable Nemesis (Doona Bae), e incluso al aguerrido Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher). Juntos, tendrán que enfrentarse al ya mencionado Noble, quien en realidad trabaja para un cruel senador llamado Balisarius (Fra Fee), quien se autodeclaró emperador de la galaxia cuando el Rey (Cary Elwes) fue asesinado años atrás. Claramente, nuestra protagonista tiene algún tipo de conexión con el rey (no podía tratarse de una mujer común y corriente). Ah, y al menos al inicio, también tenemos a un robot llamado Jimmy (¡¡!!) con la voz de Anthony Hopkins, a quien me hubiese gustado ver más. En pocas palabras: tenemos un Imperio (digo, IMPERIUM) maligno controlado por un senador, a un antagonista sádico, a una protagonista especial, y hasta personajes que blanden espadas sospechosamente parecidas a un sable de luz. Es todo extremadamente parecido a “Star Wars”, pero sin nada del encanto o gracia o sensación de descubrimiento que aquellas películas (especialmente las de Lucas) nos hacían sentir. Más bien, todo ha sido reemplazado por un tono solemne y serio, en donde los malos intentan abusar sexualmente de chicas (¡!), y el Noble de Skrein se dedica a matar y torturar y engañar gente de la forma más sádica posible. No me sorprende que la ya anunciada Versión del Director sea para mayores de 18 años. Nada de eso sería un problema grave si es que la película fuese entretenida o incluyese algún elemento relativamente novedoso, pero ese no es el caso. Un filme de fantasía o ciencia ficción no tiene que ser increíblemente original para resultar exitoso —pregúntenle, si no, a James Cameron y su franquicia de “Avatar”. Pero si aquellas producciones las termina viendo todo el mundo y su abuelita, es precisamente porque el CÓMO termina siendo más interesante que el QUÉ; la construcción fascinante de un universo, y efectos visuales incomparables. En el caso de “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego”, ni el “qué” ni el “cómo” terminan de cuajar, lo que resulta en una experiencia tediosa y absolutamente previsible. Tampoco ayuda, además, que esta primera parte no sea más que una introducción. El filme cuenta con un desenlace, sí, pero igual acaba con un final abierto, el cual lo deja a uno con la sensación de que recién ha visto una introducción —y una introducción, encima, que nos cuenta poco o nada de sus protagonistas. Kora, por ejemplo, es un personaje plano, del que nos vamos enterando un poco a través de “flashbacks”, pero que nunca demuestra tener una personalidad interesante. Y de sus compañeros se puede decir incluso menos —cada uno tiene una introducción suficientemente intrigante, pero una vez que Kora los recluta, Snyder no haca absolutamente NADA con ellos. Es alucinante. Del apartado visual no me puedo quejar, al menos. Snyder sigue insistiendo en usar lentes personalizados de poca distancia focal, lo cual le da una sensación de ensueño a la película entera —apropiado para la temática, supongo. Y la mayoría de efectos visuales son impresionantes – el robot Jimmy (todavía no puedo superar su nombre), por ejemplo, luce increíblemente realista. Puede que Snyder no haya desarrollado una buena historia en esta ocasión, pero al menos sigue demostrando que tiene buen ojo para componer imágenes interesantes y de gran impacto. Sin embargo, sí me sorprendió que “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” fuese una cinta de poca acción. Los pocos combates que incluye son entretenidos —aunque, para variar, suelen abusar de las cámaras lentas—, pero el problema es, precisamente, que no hay suficientes. El resto del filme está compuesto de exposición torpe (generalmente a través de diálogo forzado), “flashbacks”, y situaciones robadas de mejores filmes como “Star Wars”, “Duna” y hasta “Harry Potter”. Los actores, por su parte, hacen lo que pueden, pero el único que parece estar divirtiéndose es Ed Skrein. Interpretar a un villano sádico y cruel, supongo, siempre resulta entretenido —especialmente cuando el resto del reparto parece estar a punto de quedarse dormido. En fin. “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” me decepcionó a sobremanera. Estoy siempre dispuesto a darle una oportunidad a producciones originales de género y de gran presupuesto; el problema acá es que la palabra “original” no podría estar más fuera de lugar. “Rebel Moon: Parte 1 – la niña del fuego” es una amalgamación de otras historias (mejores y más interesantes), mezcladas sin tener en cuenta los aspectos emocionales, intelectuales o siquiera divertidos que la gente podría estar buscando en una nueva película. El resultado es una de las peores películas de Zack Snyder, un cineasta talentoso que ha sido responsable de filmes verdaderamente buenos (“El amanecer de los muertos”, “300”, “Watchmen”, su versión de “La liga de la justicia”), pero que acá, aparentemente, se quedó sin nada qué decir. Habrá que esperar hasta abril, pues, para ver si logra concluir esta historia de mejor manera con la segunda parte de “Rebel Moon”. Comunicador audiovisual y crítico de cine.

"Dec 30, 2023"," Less homage to Star Wars than it is a pastiche of that cultural juggernaut, a strong sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu hangs over Zack Snyderâs Rebel Moon. Unfortunately, in plainly appealing to the memory of its vastly superior inspiration so many times, it inadvertently reminds viewers of how much better its muse is. There are far too many direct copycat scenes here for Rebel Moon to craft anything like an identity of its own, but its derivativeness might be forgivable were it not so self-consciously, humorlessly straining for epicness. Rebel Moon rises with narration from Anthony Hopkins and an operatic score â a promise of grandness it never lives up to. At two-hours-plus, this dreadnought announces its lofty ambitions for future franchise status at every turn, but never once earns it: the dialogue is creakingly expository and the acting is spotty, ultimately making it feel like the film has lazily assumed it's already secured all the interest it needs to justify a potential two further sequels and a galaxy of tie-in media. Though there are bright spots that suggest an actual movie lurks somewhere deep within its 134 minutes, Rebel Moon instead feels like a laborious couple of hours of scene-setting that arrogantly banks on you returning for more, despite doing little to deserve any more of your time. There are moments when Rebel Moon nearly earns its self-seriousness, like the gripping introduction of Bae Doonaâs lightsaber-wielding Nemesis, or the moment Boutellaâs Kora rouses Djimon Hounsouâs disgraced, depressed military general with an appeal not to his honor but to his desire for revenge. Unfortunately, these glints of the film redeeming itself are almost entirely diluted in the general narrative sludge that surrounds them, and thus canât do much to entice you back for the directorâs cut that Netflix has cynically already teased, despite having the power to have simply released that instead. Co-produced by Pedro AlmodÃ³var, this tumultuous Argentine anthology film tests the limits of human sanity when pushed to the extremes â and will also test yours.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023"," Bereft of new ideas, beholden to silly slo-mo shenanigans, let it be known that writer/director Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is only truly harmful to those of us who care about proper punctuation. Netflix appears to have it as Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire. Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB have it as Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire. What in the em dash is going on here? Where does the colon belong?! That’s a weird question to be asking, given that a subset of Snyder’s fandom is so toxic they almost certainly have their heads in the orifice necessary to locate that organ. Punctuation contemplation is more thought than anyone else has invested in anything involving Rebel: Moon: Part: One: A: Child: Of: Fire. That joke was low-hanging fruit, but this is pretty much Low-Hanging Fruit — The Movie. And that’s okay sometimes! Hodgepodging together various elements of the timeless epic monomyth and throwing in some mildly original element, like say a wizard wand, can be pretty profitable! J.K. But not really. The problem is that Snyder didn’t throw in anything even mildly original. He literally pitched Star Wars executives on a redundant Seven Samurai in Space “idea” that was remade as recently as season one of The Mandalorian. When they passed, Netflix gave him eleventy billion dollars to do it anyway, without using Lucasfilm intellectual property. There are still glowing space swords, intergalactic governmental oppressors who shop at Nazi Gap, and even problematic parentage. Everyone must applaud the restraint Snyder showed in not introducing a tiny-but-powerful character who speaks backwards named Adoy. If you find yourself saying “A’doy” frequently, you won’t be alone. The entirety of Rebel Moon’s first installment would be a minutes-long montage in most movies. Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a galactic Goebbels, shows up to a small farming planet and says “feed our army or we’ll kill you all.” This doesn’t sit well with Kora (Sofia Boutella), who has a complicated past she doesn’t like talking about. Do you think maybe she’s good at killing stuff? Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) skip around the universe picking up antiheroes to assist the farmers in fighting the fascists. That’s right, the whole stinkin’ thing is the “I know just the person we need, if only they’ll agree to help” scene from a billion other better films. Snyder, notoriously addicted to slowed motion, has reached his zenith by making an entire movie out of a montage. It’s not a movie, actually. Legally, sure. Technically, yes. But realistically? No. This is the introduction to characters like Nemesis (Bae Doona), Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and Titus (Djimon Hounsou), which are names given to characters by actual grownups. There’s also a robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins named Jimmy. He wears a set of antlers at one point. Nothing really happens, other than the group is assembled. The fight at the end is so wholly inconsequential that it really only serves to finally reveal who are main character actually is. It feels like a prequel to a movie series that doesn’t exist. Snyder’s unique visual flair is quasi-irresistible. The recycled parts from better stories gin up just enough interest. The unoriginality doesn’t hit as offensive, just lazy. And although everything feels like a video game cut scene that introduces playable characters…they would probably be fun to play with? Again, to be clear, this is not a movie. It isn’t even really the first part of a movie. It is a live-action adaptation of the cast of characters. The biggest fear here is that streaming services without concerns about theatrical experiences who are content to blur the line between TV series and movies are producing mushy messes that don’t work as either content form. If this is the next step in the degradation of cinema, wow is it hilarious that the horseman of the apocalypse…is Zack Snyder. Gissane Sophia at Marvelous Geeks Media says “It’s hard to decipher who we’re meant to trust and what relationship we’re meant to invest in here. In no way, shape, or form does Rebel Moon Part One feel like it knows what it wants to be.” Siddhant Adlakha at Joy Sauce says “While it avoids Hollywood’s penchant for orientalism, and instead uses its designs to create an explicit anti-imperial and anti-colonial text, it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences, and exists only as a mal-formed piece of marketing for something better.” D.R. Medlen at The Mary Sue says “Rebel Moon puts the Snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish. It’s not Shakespeare, but it sure is fun.”",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2023"," Permit me to take a short stroll down memory lane: It’s 1977, and I have convinced my parents to take me to the movie theater at the Tyrone Gardens in St. Petersburg to see “Star Wars” — not “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope,” because no one knew that this was the first film in what would become a multibillion-dollar franchise. When I viewed the film for the first time, it was still just “Star Wars,” an epic space opera boasting a narrative built upon a mythic structure model with traditional archetypes. It was still just gratifying sci-fi fantasy, with space battles and laser swords. Soon, the film would become embedded in popular culture, with creator and director George Lucas reaping the benefits of a merchandising juggernaut. The success of the first “Star Wars” film enabled Lucas to make more films — both sequels and prequels — and to expand his fictional universe as he explored the “Skywalker Saga.” But before “Star Wars” became a pop culture phenomenon, Lucas had no guarantee there would be a continuation of the series. The original “Star Wars” works as a standalone story, conveyed in an easy-to-follow three-act structure that clearly identifies the struggle between good and evil and provides the audience with a satisfying resolution to the conflicts. It requires no follow-up, but it depicts such wonderfully rendered compelling characters in vivid settings that the audience wants to see more: more adventures, more alien worlds, and, well, more merchandise. The first problem with “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” is that it lacks a satisfying resolution to the conflicts it introduces. Directed by Zack Snyder, the first installment of the epic space opera was released in select theaters on Dec. 15 before making its streaming debut on Netflix on Dec. 21. Synder also intends to drop an extended cut in early 2024, before releasing “Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver” on April 19. The film revolves around Kora (Sofia Boutella), a woman with a mysterious past who has been embraced by a peaceful settlement of farmers on the moon Veldt. When Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives demanding tribute in the form of food to fill the bellies of his troops, Kora warns the community that this emissary of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) will take “everything” from them unless they fight. Because the farmers aren’t equipped to defend themselves, the burden of finding fighters willing to risk their lives falls upon Kora. She and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a nonviolent but pragmatic farmer, travel to a cantina in Mos Eisley — sorry, scratch that: I mean, they visit a seedy bar full of aliens in the port town of Providence where they meet Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a smuggler who can provide transportation on his stealthy spaceship.  Along the way, Kora and Gunnar recruit General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary but disgraced commander living on a world assembled from Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” props and set dressings; Nemesis (Doona Bae), a master swordswoman who battles the love child of Shelob and the Borg Queen before joining the campaign; and Tarak (Staz Nair), a noble prince possessing Tarzan’s rapport with animals, who for some incomprehensible reason must ride a creature that looks like Buckbeak’s second cousin to gain his freedom. Snyder is cherry picking tropes and cinematic elements to fill in gaps in the narrative. “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” evokes, pays homage to, and draws inspiration from the work of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tolkien, Pierre Christin, Robert A. Heinlein, and Poul Anderson; and from films such as Julie Taymor’s “Titus,” John Sturges’ “The Magnificent Seven,” and the original “Star Wars” trilogy.  Snyder’s primary influence must have been Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai,” which also shaped “The Magnificent Seven,” with Sturges altering the story’s setting to the old west. Snyder adapts it to fit the space opera mold — but he’s not the first to make that leap. In 1980, Roger Corman — in a blatant attempt to capitalize on the popularity of “Star Wars” — produced “Battle Beyond the Stars,” a film promoted as “‘Magnificent Seven’ in outer space.” Directed by Jimmy T. Murakami, this low-budget endeavor starred Richard Thomas as Shad, a young Akira farmer who enlists various mercenaries to save his people from Sador (John Saxon), leader of the very naughty Malmori raiders.  Snyder’s take is undeniably a superior film in terms of scope and production, with the director’s signature style making it visually appealing. But “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” suffers from a scarcity of characterization, emotion, and narrative subtleties. The script lacks nuance, genuine tension, warmth and humor. Snyder’s characters are tiresomely serious to the point of being tedious. It shouldn’t be this difficult to root for the reluctant hero Kora. It shouldn’t be this taxing riding along as she goes planet-hopping to round up her allies.  I should be able to take Skrein seriously as the fascist villain, but every time Atticus Noble is on screen, I keep seeing Rik Mayall's character Rick from “The Young Ones.” The two most promising characters in the film — JC1435, a sentient battle robot voiced by Anthony Hopkins; and Sam (Charlotte Maggi), a young woman from the farming settlement on Veldt — have limited screen time in the first installment of the saga. Maybe, there will be more story, better pacing, and expanded depth to the characters in Snyder’s extended cut. Maybe “Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver” will somehow improve the first installment. I hope that is the case, because Snyder is capable of making films that are both dazzling and entertaining. I honestly want to like this product. The characters have the potential to be interesting. Their cause is one that should resonate with the viewer. Their universe is filled with gorgeous alien planets and races that could be a prolific source of future storytelling. But Snyder needs to give the viewer some reason to empathize with the heroes, to cheer them on to victory, and to yearn to explore the uncharted worlds beyond the pages of the script.  Lee Clark Zumpe is entertainment editor at Tampa Bay Newspapers, a Tomatometer-Approved Critic, and an author of short fiction appearing in select anthologies and magazines.

"Dec 29, 2023"," A tedious slog through an avalanche of genre clichés, made worse by an air of pretentiousness and ponderous self-importance, Zack Snyder’s latest piece of Netflix bombast “Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire” spends over two hours of world-building to create a place no sane viewer would ever want to visit once, let alone the multiple times its subtitle suggests we’re meant to go back to it.  It’s an excruciating bore. The plot is supposedly an original creation of Snyder and co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten but actually a derivative hodgepodge of bits and pieces of other, better movies, with classics by Kurosawa and Lucas the main models.  It involves a growing rebellion against an evil empire by some of its oppressed people and the recruitment of members to join its ranks.  And after overloading us with laborious exposition, elephantine backstory and a repetitious sequence of episodes that are one-half ponderous talk and the other chaotic fights that often slip into slow-motion for presumed effect (and always conclude with a shot of the planet-hopping recruitment ship flying off for its next destination), it has the temerity to close with the observation that we’ve just witnessed “the beginning of something.”  One could only wish that it were the beginning of something else. Some of the narration is delivered in the instantly recognizable tones of Anthony Hopkins, who provides the voice of a robot named Jimmy, once a warrior but now ensconced on a moon called Veldt, where a bedraggled community of farmers led by Sindri (Corey Stoll, wearing a most unbecoming beard) ekes out a hand-to-mouth existence.  (Hopkins, fortunately for him, doesn’t actually have to appear in the movie.  Jimmy is played by Dustin Ceithamer, so Hopkins is basically doing a James Earl Jones thing.) Veldt is part of the empire, or Imperium, controlled by the Motherworld, which was once a monarchy whose King (Carey Elwes) and Queen (Rhian Rees) hoped that their angelic daughter Princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald) would usher in a new era of peace and harmony.  But, as we learn through narration and gauzy flashbacks, the royal family was assassinated, and power was seized by Belisarius (Fra Fee), a militaristic tyrant whose chief henchman Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), dressed in quasi-Nazi garb, cruises about the galaxy in a huge Dreadnought, tasked with snuffing out any remnants of resistance to the new order.  One of his stops is Veldt, where he demands that the community provide grain for his crew.  When some protest that compliance would mean their own starvation, Noble responds with murder and a simple takeover of the place before departing. Naturally his action causes distress, and Kora (Sofia Boutella), an outsider who was taken in by the farmers when she crash landed on Veldt, becomes an instigator of resistance—it will later be revealed that she was an imperial warrior who turned against the regime, and thus a wanted fugitive.  She’s joined by handsome farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), who’s besotted with her, and together they persuade Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a rogue pilot who for some reason speaks with an Irish brogue, to ferry them to other planets to seek out warriors to join in the protection of their moon. At this point the movie turns into a repetitive formula in which the three travel to some locale where they can approach a noteworthy prospect to join them; in each case Snyder structures the episode to begin with visuals attesting to the otherworldly character of the place (the production designers were Stephen Swain and Stefan Dechant, the costumer Stephanie Porter) and lots of surpassingly banal conversation before securing a “yes,” which is followed by a gigantic fight he tries to jazz up with bursts of super-speeded up action and slow-motion for “effect.”  By the time all the stopovers are complete, the intrepid trio have found a group of supposedly charismatic companions: Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a former imperial general now a drunken layabout; Nemesis (Doona Bae) a swordswoman whose weapons shoot out beams of light energy; Tarak (Staz Nair), an enslaved smithy who’s also an exceptional animal-whisperer; and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), whose moniker is descriptive of his talents.  By the close they’re all headed back for Veldt and, presumably a confrontation with Noble, who’s shown receiving a set of stern marching orders from his sneering master Belisarius. Snyder adds a plethora of genre piffle to amplify the plot; at one point, for example, Tarak takes flight aboard a weird winged creature that proves the writer-director knows his Harryhausen as well as Kurosawa and Lucas, and at another Jenna Malone camps it up as a ravenous alien spider-woman who does battle with Nemesis.  Such stuff only increases the nonsensicality of it all; the picture increasingly feels like a grab-bag of cheesy tropes, for the most part realized in mediocre CGI (the effects supervisors were Marcus Taormina and John “DJ” DesJadin) and shot in the same dark, murky style that Snyder brought to the series of DCU movies he oversaw and which, acting as his own cinematographer, he repeats here.  Editor Dody Dorn can do little to mitigate the monotony of the story and the visuals, and while Tom Holkenborg’s score ladles out music intended to inspire awe, it’s to no avail. Nor can the cast bring much zest to the sodden material, though they’re induced to pour a lot of energy into the attempt.  Boutella makes an athletic if inexpressive heroine, and Skrein’s sleazy villainy carries a certain campy charm, but the rest can’t invest their cardboard characters with any sort of inner life.

"Dec 28, 2023"," Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a cumbersome, disjointed space version of A Bug’s Life that’s solely saved and made viewable because of its outstanding cast. While visually stunning and somewhat engaging enough to keep a viewer’s attention, the writing is all over the place, making it constantly questionable why we’re supposed to care. The dialogue is so clunky at times that even the deliveries coming from great actors feel forced in every way. Rebel Moon wants to be an epic with such intensity that it loses itself in an attempt to tell a compelling story. The CGI is acceptable; some of the creatures are genuinely riveting, as are the characters, but the pacing fumbles in its endeavor to take us through various sectors of different times and places. It’s obvious the film is meant to encompass one part of a story, but the arc doesn’t feel contained enough to leave a mark. There’s much to be desired, sure, but it’s hard to predict whether the second half will even manage to save it. There’s also something to be said about how the film could’ve fleshed out relationships more to make it additionally appealing in the grand scheme of storytelling. Part of the reason why Star Wars: A New Hope works so well despite the slow steadiness of its narrative approach is because the character dynamics it’s setting up are thoroughly engrossing from beginning to end. It’s hard to decipher who we’re meant to trust and what relationship we’re meant to invest in here. In no way, shape, or form does Rebel Moon Part One feel like it knows what it wants to be. However, it’s imperative to note that Sofia Boutella is an undeniable star. Kora is the most magnetic character in the story, and diving further into her past could have made the story even more inviting. Whatever we follow her through feels earned and thoughtfully crafted, which is also entirely due to Boutella’s performances. It’s clear as day that the actress is aware of her character’s heart and motives in a way that helps to bring the best to the surface. Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, and Stuart Martin also do an incredible job with the material they’re given. Quiet moments in the film result in some of the most vulnerable displays of humanity, but they’re so scarce that it’s not enough to save the narrative from falling apart. Whether the R-rated director’s cut makes a difference is hard to tell, but when a film is released with this many questions left in the air, you have to ask yourself what the purpose of it is anyway. Who’s running the show, leaving one version clunky while another could potentially shine, and who has the time and patience to commit to both? For a visually stunning film of this caliber, it’s unfortunate that the plot and characterizations don’t match the beauty. The third act is especially gorgeous, and the final few scenes leave off with the kind of space explosions that are always enjoyable to see for those of us who love the genre. Still, it’s not enough to make Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire a film worth watching more than once or one that’ll be well remembered, either.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 28, 2023"," Is there anything left to write about Zack Snyder? He is a polarising figure in film communities, although I am unsure if polarising is the right word. “Polarising” tends to refer to filmmakers who present challenging “love-it-or-hate-it” content, or who address controversial topics. In Snyder’s case, the vigorous and oftentimes angry debate is over whether or not his films are actually any good, or if he himself has a reasonable amount of talent. It is a debate that has raged throughout his directorial career. Personally I tend to sit on the fence. I liked his 2004 remake of Dawn of the Dead, as I did his underrated Man of Steel trilogy of films (2013-21). On the other hand, his 300 (2007) and Watchmen (2009) adaptations left me cold, and I actively loathed his 2011 original Sucker Punch. My personal bottom line is that Snyder has a strong visual aesthetic that tends to over-use CGI and slow motion, that he is a deft hand at replicating other people’s imagery, but that he has no story sense whatsoever. This is a shame, because I get the very strong impression that Snyder would not agree. Rebel Moon is Snyder’s latest work, a much-hyped science fiction epic broken into two parts (the second comes next April). It sees an interplanetary military force arrive at a remote agrarian community and violently demand they hand over all of their harvest. With no way for the community to defend itself, a solo representative travels to the neighbouring planets in the search of soldiers and mercenaries who will come to their aid. If the premise sounds familiar, it is because it is: Akira Kurosawa filmed it in 1954 as Seven Samurai. Or perhaps you recognise it from John Sturges’ 1960 remake The Magnificent Seven. Or from John Lasseter and Andrew Stanton’s A Bug’s Life (1998), which liberally lifts from the original story as well. As does Dean Parisot’s Galaxy Quest (1999), Tsui Hark’s Seven Swords (2005), and – most pertinently – Jimmy T. Murakami’s sci-fi potboiler Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). Even Gareth Edwards’ 2016 Star Wars feature Rogue One cribs liberally from Kurosawa’s original playbook. The point is that for all of Netflix’s hyping of Rebel Moon as an exciting new space opera, it is actually based on pretty well-furrowed ground. This is not necessarily a bad thing: as all of the previous films mentioned have demonstrated, the execution of an old story is as much a key to success as the story itself. With enormous scope to remix and innovate, Snyder has instead gathered together a painfully obvious collection of- I hesitate to write ‘influences’, as that seems to give Snyder too much credit. ‘Things to photocopy and then mash together’ feels rather more appropriate. Star Wars is a very dominant influence, but it is also easy to see imagery cribbed from a wide range of anime productions, Korean cinema, and the popular wargame Warhammer 40,000. In most cases this assembled pastiche inspires a bored over-familiarity rather than any sense of remix or play. The film is generic pulp, which will likely find an undemanding audience but reeks of missed opportunities. It is also particularly unsubtle: its villain (played by Ed Skrein) does not simply resemble a Nazi like Star Wars‘ galactic empire, he is literally dressed as one. There is an oddly talented cast here, including Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, and Anthony Hopkins, but they are left hanging by a screenplay that does not provide them with any material to build upon. My advice? Watch Battle Beyond the Stars. At the time of writing it is streaming on Amazon Prime, it offers the same basic story, has its own talented cast including John Saxon, George Peppard, and Robert Vaughn, and never tries to pretend it is anything more than shameless pulp entertainment. It also provides a complete story with beginning, middle, and end – Rebel Moon demands you come back in four months for that. I imagine more than a few viewers will not bother.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 27, 2023"," Two months after the May 1980 release of The Empire Strikes Back in US cinemas, came a Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven in Space knock-off that was out to capitalise on Empire's pull and which is most notable for the up-and-coming talents off-camera. It had a script by future Oscar nominee John Sayles, a score by Titanic Oscar winner James Horner, and special effects by a certain James Cameron. From little cosmic acorns grow... Battle Beyond the Stars doesn't loom large in anorak lore, but it does come to mind watching Netflix's Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire as 300 and Justice League director Zack Snyder repackages the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven narrative for a two-part space opera. The second instalment, The Scargiver, is due next April. This scene-setter sees a farming community on the planet Veldt terrorised by the army of the Mother World, who need the crops to feed the troops. Figuring it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees, mysterious villager Kora (Sofia Boutella) packs her bags and heads off to put together a bunch of hired guns/swords that can lead the farmers in fighting back. There's loads of melodrama here and Rebel Moon takes itself very seriously, but it will be no hardship for anyone with a thing for sci-fi action. Boutella is good in the set pieces, there's a decent supporting cast (Anthony Hopkins voices a robot, Charlie Hunnam's smuggler has, wait for it, a Belfast accent), and the nostalgia synapses will be firing goodo. Keep the movie reference bingo card handy. With a cliffhanger ending, Snyder has nicely set up part two, describing it as ""a war movie"". Chances are, you'll be pitching up on Veldt again next April. © RTÉ 2024. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

"Dec 27, 2023"," En los confines distantes de la galaxia, una apacible colonia enfrenta la amenaza de un poder tiránico, desencadenando una lucha desesperada por la supervivencia. En este contexto, emerge la enigmática Kora como la última esperanza, convocando a un ecléctico grupo de individuos dispuestos a desafiar el destino. Entre forasteros, insurgentes, campesinos y huérfanos de guerra, se forja un nuevo ejército de héroes dispuestos a enfrentar el desafío que se avecina. Lo que podría haber sido un digno ""fanfiction"" de Star Wars se convierte en una experiencia desalentadora. La falta de originalidad en el diseño de situaciones, junto con un tema demasiado básico, socava cualquier intento de la película por destacar en el género de la ciencia ficción. Los personajes, apenas esbozados, carecen de la profundidad necesaria para conectar, y sus motivaciones son tan difusas como las estrellas en la galaxia. A medida que la trama se desenvuelve, los personajes, con la heroína principal encarnada por la sutil Sofia Boutella a la cabeza, se ven inmersos en situaciones que carecen por completo de profundidad. Sus interacciones se limitan a diálogos simplistas, inverosímiles, despojados de la riqueza emocional y los matices que podrían haber dado vida a sus personalidades. La principal deficiencia de Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego reside en su equivocada suposición de que los espectadores estarán dispuestos a aguardar la siguiente entrega para alcanzar una comprensión completa de la trama. Aunque la película se introduce como una mera porción de un relato más extenso, esta elección estratégica revela un desacierto fundamental. La expectativa de postergar la revelación integral de la narrativa se traduce en una desconexión potencial, socavando así la coherencia y el impacto de la obra en su conjunto. Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego, que ofrece un boceto en lugar de una historia auténtica y profunda, es sin duda la peor película de Zack Snyder hasta la fecha, una decepción intergaláctica para aquellos que esperaban algo más de esta incursión en el vasto espacio sideral.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 27, 2023"," La sociedad de Zack Snyder y Netflix no empezaba con buen pie con ‘El ejército de los muertos’, casi un testamento, zombies de por medio, de por qué el director no había hecho más que devaluar su poder narrativo desde la que es aún hoy su mejor película, ‘Amanecer de los muertos’. Algo que sorprende al comprobar que 'Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego' es su película más consistente desde hace más de una década, lo que resulta paradójico al ser otra propuesta de Netflix. Esta afirmación responde a que muchas veces hemos comprobado que los grandes directores tienden a entregar sus películas más mediocres cuando están dentro de los confines de libertad sin límites que les ofrece la gran plataforma. Incluso en ‘El Irlandés’ de Martin Scorsese se llegaba a notar en sus tres horas y media. Los Coen hicieron un capricho irregular y no tan gracioso como pensaban, Wes Anderson no ha dejado huella, Duncan Jones se cargó su carrera allí. Parece que muchos autores tropiezan en su paso a la plataforma, era de esperar que Snyder fuera todavía a peor. Pero el caso es más bien al revés, la carta blanca de 166 millones al director resulta aquí un bálsamo por dos motivos concretos. No tiene un lastre de justificar sus decisiones visuales para deificar figuras de la cultura pop previas, con lo que nos ahorra el mal rato de sus justificaciones para encajar historias y humor sin gracia en su revisionismo de DC, por otra, su confianza en su propia pericia estética logra aquí cotas inalcanzables gracias a la falta de barreras absurdas. Su madurez es más o menos equiparable al delirio absoluto. La sorpresa es que en este caso su disciplina iconoclasta se encuentra con formas de arte que van más allá del cine, pero nadie quiere, busca, o le obliga a justificarlo, por lo que de alguna manera acaba siendo algo más radical y vanguardista, pese a que el motor de esa fuerza creadora provenga de la misma simiente de un merluzo borracho de anabolizante y videojuegos. La realidad es que quizá por accidente se haya liberado su voz más pura y que realmente sea más inofensiva y bella de lo que habíamos calibrado quienes despreciamos su ‘Snyder Cut’. Lo gracioso es que la operación nos dejará su visión completa en la plataforma en febrero, pero mientras tanto, el resultado del experimento es un divertido pastiche pop de Space Opera y fantasía épica ochentera que encaja como un guante en el estilo impresionista del Snyder, es decir puro espectáculo visual, impecable en cada decisión técnica, que además de dejar la boca abierta en ocasiones, deja con ganas de Parte 2, que seguramente doble la apuesta hasta límites que solo pueden caer o bien en lo chabacano o la genialidad. Y es que viendo ‘Rebel Moon parte I’ es fácil darse cuenta de que a estas alturas, los guiones del cine de Snyder no van a mejorar. Por supuesto que aquí no es el caso, pero al menos en está ocasión la juguetería del director, con esa forma de ir mostrando personajes como si fuera un niño presentándonos a los distintos modelos de los Másters del Universo que le han traído los reyes, a cada cuál más vigoréxico, tiene una coherencia temática y estética que funciona solo dentro de su mundo. Sí, también tiene un hilo simple del que no se sale en más de dos horas, sin derrapes fuera del tiesto, sin bromas y humor forzados que no encaja, y se compromete con su visión con precisión. Claro que acusa el síndrome de meter ""todo lo que le gusta"" a Snyder sin mayor criterio que la macedonia, pero la forma de ir introduciendo nuevas escenas responde a una especie de intentona de elipsis que ya es capaz de mejorar el pasapantallas con filtro rapie de pajillero gamer de  ‘Sucker Punch’, donde la idea era ir visitando diferentes escenarios para escenas de acción. Pero si en aquella la excusa no colaba, aquí las visitas a los planetas justifican una variedad de influencias que van del Cyber Punk al spaguetti western, al resampleo de las culturas clásicas. Mezclar ‘Dune’, el chambara, ‘Star Wars’ y la violencia y estética militarista no es totalmente original, y en ese aspecto ‘Rebel Moon’ no es tan distinta a lo delirios de cómic y excesos de blockbusters pulp de los últimos años como ‘Las crónicas de Riddick’ (2004) o ‘Júpiter Ascending’ (2015), la diferencia es que el mimo de cada composición, el brutal uso del anamórfico y la excelencia de los efectos especiales justifican la piñata de referencias, que tienen la saga de George Lucas como punto de partida, pero también como punto de fuga final. No por casualidad, se ha comparado ‘Rebel Moon’ con ‘Los siete magníficos’, ya que junta batallas galácticas y la versión Western de Kurosawa como lo hacía ya una premisa de un rip-off de la película de George Lucas producido por Roger Corman en 1980, ‘Los siete magníficos del espacio’, que no es la única con la que comparte espíritu, sino que hay detalles que incluso podrían coincidir con ‘Star Crash, choque de galaxias’ (1978). Porque la película se desata y parece estar más cómoda en los universos visuales de aventuras galácticas aparecidas a partir del éxito galáctico, en especial sintonía con la ‘Flash Gordon’ de 1980 y su vestuario sobrecargado, chillón y grandilocuente por el simple hecho de serlo. Aunque estuviera pensada como una película de ‘Star Wars’, la producción de Netflix se deja incluso llevar por los grandes cómics de bárbaros y la moda que dio tantas copias también de Conan, dejando aquí algunos momentos y personajes que no desentonarían en ‘El señor de las bestias’ (1982), como ese musculoso que doma a un grifo con toda su musculatura en tensión, bien embadurnada, en una de las escenas de acción más plásticas y vigorosas que se han visto este año. No debería soprender a nadie la pleitesía al poderío de estos personajes y seres de fantasía  que habitan espacios con una dirección artística que recuerda a las películas de fantasía oscura barrocas como ‘Krull’ (1983), quizá tan imcomprendida como esta, las láminas de Frank Frazetta, el universo de forzudos semidesnudos del ‘Den’ de Richard Corben y en general una inspiración en las portadas a todo color de Metal Hurlant, en las que la sensualidad omnipresente, típica de desplegable de revista para adultos, no estaba reñida con la ciencia ficción basada en autores de cierto prestigio. Aunque en ese mejunje destaca el origen en el terror de Snyder, que sigue dejando huella en sus películas, y ‘Rebel Moon’ tiene un buen surtido de criaturas y viscosidades, con una mujer araña que recuerda a las de ‘Kamen Rider ZO’ (1993) o ‘Spookies’ (1986) y una combinación de CGI y buenas prótesis que se echan en falta en otras space opera recientes. El surtido es inabarcable y es prácticamente seguro que se amplíe y extienda en el futuro, pero el punto de partida deja la idea de que Snyder realmente ha encontrado su gran proyecto épico de larga duración. Es cierto que su reticencia a guiones bien escritos, personajes con definición y cohesión de principio a fin diluyen el poder de impacto de un cine desde la entraña misma de la fascinación, pero en ‘Rebel Moon’ Zack Snyder ahuyenta a los fantasmas del exceso y se reboza en su creatividad óptica más intrépida, o insensata, y con ello consigue que su tesis aterrize en un lugar en el que la imagen en movimiento puede ser suficiente para mover emociones, revirtiendo su filia a la horterada MTV de los 2000 a una facultad renacentista que quizá complete en un fresco de dos largometrajes de los que inspiraban el cómic europeo de antaño.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2023"," No matter how much snow or how many elves you have to offer, what most people really want from a film at Christmas is blockbuster action. We know this from box office and streamer stats, and it’s backed up by basic psychology. The year is coming to a close. We’ve worked hard and experienced a fair bit of stress. It’s cold, daylight is at a premium and many of us are keeping company with family member who, for all that we might love them, definitely get on our nerves. Of course we want to see something explode. Zack Snyder understands that. In this, part one of a hoped-for new saga (with filming on part two already underway), he takes all the classic elements of the science fiction or fantasy action spectacular and condenses them for our viewing pleasure. The result is a ridiculous mess, but it may nonetheless be just what you need. It reminded this reviewer, more than anything, of 1980 schlock classic Battle Beyond The Stars, itself a sci-fi takes on The Magnificent Seven (which was, of course, based on Akira Kurosawa’s magnificent Seven Samurai). Snyder knows how to deliver space opera by numbers and twee as it is, the amount of clichés that he manages to pack into a single film is impressive. It’s a film which deserves to be watched in a group and enthusiastically heckled, with a bit of popcorn-throwing to add to the fun. The dialogue is, or course, uniformly terrible. “The very idea of love and family was beaten out of me,” says heroine Kora (Sofia Boutella) at the start, letting us know what we’re in for. She’s a former outlaw (and, it turns out, a lot of other things) hiding out in a galactic backwater with a group of subsistence-farming Vikings (don’t ask). She wants to stop running, find a peaceful home, and all the rest of it, but those hopes are thwarted when a large spaceship known as a Dreadnaught suddenly lands there are a troupe of space Nazis strolls out of it (the uniforms have been adapted a bit, the hats less so). They want pretty much all the grain the place can produce, which would leave the locals to starve. kora insists it’s not her problem, but changes her mind when a local girl is (with extreme gratuitousness, but hey, Snyder managed a whole 28 minutes before going there this time) threatened with rape. A spectacularly silly fight sequence follows, and after that Kora basically has no choice but to set out to lead a rebellion against the all-powerful bad guys before they find and kill her and everyone she’s ever known. Accompanying her is ordinary farm boy Gunnar. In the absence of any available Chris, he’s played by Michiel Huisman, who does his best impression of a Chris. Most of the rest of the film concerns their efforts to build an army. This starts with Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a scruffy looking pilot who describes himself as “a bit of an opportunist”. They go on to acquire Tarak (Staz Nair), a long-haired muscular slave guy with a secret past who intuitively understands animals, Beastmaster-style, and who never deigns to put on any more clothes no matter where they go. Next up is Nemesis (Bae Doona, who, in the absence of lines, does her best to make her presence felt by glowering). She’s a sword-wielding warrior with a strict honour code and a thirst for revenge, who sometimes uses thinly disguised lightsabers instead. Just in case you thought that was enough of a stereotype, we also get Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), a Black revolutionary with dreadlocks and heavy forehead make-up (perhaps inspired by Furiosa), who fights with a spear. Finally, there’s Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced former general whose feelings of guilt about the deaths of his men have driven him to alcoholism. Oh, and there’s some lassie with woad on her face, apropos of nothing. Although you’d think these ‘characters’ didn’t need much building, Snyder spends a fair bit of time on it, and that’s not such a bad thing, because it means that we get to see Nemesis fight a giant spider monster (which is really bad at fighting back, like many a Snyder bad guy, but it’s still fun). Tarak bonds with an utterly adorable giant raven/griffin thingy which, despite the CGI, has something of the charm of an old stop-motion Harryhausen creation. There’s a lot of great creature design, especially in the background, where one imagines that the effects team were more at liberty to play. Ed Skrein’s lead bad guy spends his private time getting intimate with a tentacle monster, and the abundance of such details helps to give the various worlds a lived-in feel, despite the shallowness of the actual plot. Parts of it are in poor taste. That initial attempted rape is not the only incidence of sexual violence, and for all that Snyder thinks he’s being clever by turning things round, with his heroine coming to the rescue, there’s a nastiness about it which sits awkwardly in what is otherwise quite an amiable little adventure movie. Likewise, the little lectures about the need for everybody to be more cynical and pre-emptively violent are as out of place as they are philosophically vapid. The film is at its best when not pretending to be clever. There’s a lot of fighting, involving numerous ridiculous stunts, and though it’s not particularly well shot, it keeps things pacey. There are glamorous costumes and shiny weapons. There are explosions which are both orange and teal at the same time. A large budget was no doubt splurged on this, but in essence it’s a great little B-movie, and if you go into it expecting that, you won’t be too disappointed.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 26, 2023"," So we are back! Time to catch up on some more recent movie reviews. I forgot to share my Best of the Year video in my last post but don’t miss it! I honestly put off seeing this movie because it seemed very pretentious but when I actually went to see it it was actually quite accessible and engrossing. In fact, it almost made my best of the year video but was a strong honorable mention. Basically Anatomy of a Fall is a compelling crime courtroom drama where we are asked to question if a woman killed her husband or is it the accident she claims. The movie keeps you guessing to the end as it layers clues through court testimony and flashbacks. It’s the kind of movie multiple people could watch and have different opinions about. Sandra Hüller is excellent (and very good in Zone of Interest that I reviewed in the last post) as the main protagonist as is Milo Machado Graner as her son Daniel. It’s the kind of movie Hollywood would ruin with poorly staged melodrama instead of trusting the audience with ambiguities and flawed characters. It is an R rating but I think a lot of people would be entertained by this film. It’s not the arthouse niche film I thought it was at first. As a lover of anime I am always looking for ways to introduce friends to the artform in accessible and engrossing ways. The First Slam Dunk is such a film and one of my favorite films of 2023. It’s a simple movie that tells us the story of a high school basketball team that’s trying to compete and manage the stresses of their personal lives. As we get to know the players on and off the court director Takehiko Inoue does a great job of building the importance of the big game and even the big shot so we are waiting with baited breath to see what will happen. The game scenes are so well done my only regret is having to watch it at home and not on the big screen (it was only at my theater for one weekend and I missed it which I bitterly regret.) Even so what a compelling film that almost anyone will enjoy. My only flaw with it is I think the character designs look like professional athletes rather than high school students. I guess that’s the way the manga is but it did take me out of the story a couple of times. Still, I highly recommend The First Slam Dunk. I am not a wrestling fan but my friend Ryan Cam is and he had prepared me for this upcoming film The Iron Claw and the intense tale it is telling. I know people hate spoilers but this is a film where I do think knowing what you are getting into is a good idea particularly with how triggering it could be for some individuals (2 characters commit suicide.) The crazy thing is in real life there was another brother in the Von Erich family that committed suicide that they left out! I have rarely been more angry at a character than I was at the father played by Holt McCallany in this film. You think about all the people who would do anything for a child and then to see the way this man manipulates and abuses his children it’s infuriating. The only thing he cared about was wrestling not the humans he was entrusted with. Zac Efron is excellent as one of the brothers Kevin as is Jeremy Allen White as Kerry. It’s a tough sit but extremely moving and I do recommend it if only for the incredible performances. I really disliked the first trailer for Migration because it felt like another middling entry from Illumination. After being disappointed by their The Super Mario Bros Movie earlier this year my hopes weren’t high for this bird movie but then the trailers started to get better and with director Benjamin Renner at the helm I had more confidence and that optimism was not in vain! This is probably my favorite film from Illumination and ended up being a very enjoyable family film. The story is pretty basic with the road trip and the neurotic parent scared to leave the nest but the script by Mike White is funny and the voice acting is all well done. The only thing I would change is we didn’t really need the over-the-top chef villain. He’s fine for the restaurant scene but didn’t need to stay throughout the film. There’s enough drama going on with the journey we didn’t need a supervillain complicating things. But this is an entertaining, funny, well-written adventure the whole family will love. I actually hadn’t watched Robot Dreams when my colleagues at UFCA nominated it for best animated film. I’m the animation girl so I was a little embarrassed they selected something I hadn’t seen so I immediately watched my screener dvd for it and am so glad they selected it! What a delightful animated film. It instantly went up my list of the best movies of 2023. I’m so sad that not many have seen this film because it is so charming. It’s a simple story of a dog that makes a robot to be his best friend and the amazing summer they have together. I love the hand drawn animation by Pablo Berger and the way the movie uses music is so endearing. It might be my favorite use of “September” by Earth Wind & Fire ever in a movie. This movie is joy in movie form and I adored it. Keep an eye out for it if you can see it in a theater or on streaming. I actually wasn’t a big fan of 2017’s Loving Vincent. While the visual style of using Van Gogh’s paintings to make an animated film was impressive the story was not captivating for a feature film. If you loved that film I am not sure what you will think of the team’s follow-up The Peasants but it also wasn’t for me. While the visual style is unique it feels slicker and less arresting than Loving Vincent and the story here is so relentlessly bleak it was hard to watch. This is an animated film for adults where a young teen begins an affair with a married man and ends up marrying his father and things get expectedly messy with rape and assault involved throughout the picture. It’s very depressing without the moving moments of something depressing like The Iron Claw. I just really didn’t enjoy it despite the impressive visual achievement. It’s no secret to anyone who follows movies that director Zack Snyder can be very divisive in his films. He has a huge hive that devotedly follows everything he does and then a large group that can’t stand most of his work. He’s normally not my favorite but I do like some films like his most recent Zack Snyder’s Justice League. Now he is releasing a new sci-fi epic that was evidently originally pitched to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars film but was not accepted and sent over to Netlflix. I was able to see it on the big screen and left confused by what Snyder had put together. For an epic sci-fi film it was surprisingly small in feel for most of the movie. A lot of the first half is spent on a farming planet and people confronted with a Nazi type character played by Ed Skrein and what they are going to do about it. Then Sofia Boutella’s Kora goes out into space to try and find warriors ala The Magnificent Seven and Seven Samurai but in space. The second half does get more epic in feel but it’s still arrive at a planet, talk to people and maybe have a little bit of action. Small when I expected big. I guess Snyder has an entirely different cut of the movie which is very annoying especially when a film has a limited theatrical so it doesn’t need to be PG-13. It feels like a phony attempt to create a ‘Snyder Cut’ movement where none needed to occur. Still, the movie is fine if you like sci-fi but nothing special. It’s not offensively bad. Just forgettable. I’d rather just watch Star Wars even though that franchise has been pretty bad lately. At least it has occasional characters and places I care about. This is bland and left me pretty meh for part 2, which I think says a lot. I would like to put in a longer review of The Boy and the Heron particularly when I get the chance to see it again when I am more rested. I actually saw it opening night at a midnight screening so I was pretty tired and did struggle to stay awake throughout the entire movie. Still, it’s definitely an impressive visual achievement full of imagination and creativity. The type of film only Miyazaki could come up with. I also loved the music by Joe Hisaishi and I hope the Academy will finally recognize his genius with a nomination. The story was a lot and kind of all over the place but it left me intrigued to see it again and study its themes. It also has a lot of weird birds which aren’t exactly my favorite! Still, I have a feeling it’s a movie that will grow on me the more I see it and it’s always a treat to see a Miyazaki film in the theaters. More please! Obviously I’m a big fan of rom-coms and for the most part this year has been a really good year for the genre both on the big and small screen, so I was excited for Anyone But You. An R rated modern take on Much Ado About Nothing seemed like just my thing, but I came away thinking it was just ok.  The parts where it leans into the Shakespeare play work the best and Glen Powell is so good as your romantic lead. Unfortunately Sydney Sweeney felt very wooden and that impacted the chemistry between the two. The physical comedy didn’t really work and the supporting cast is mostly wasted. Fans of the genre will enjoy it but it just could have been so much better. Lately I have been enjoying Indian action cinema a lot more than what Hollywood is providing. They have a spectacle and excitement you don’t get in many American films these days. This is why I jumped at the chance to see the new film from Prashanth Neel starring Prabhas called Salaar: Part 1- Ceasefire. It’s a mouthful of a title and a whole lot of movie to match but it mostly was a big bombastic fun time at the cinema. Prabhas is such a titan in these roles and the action is visceral and extremely bloody (if you are squeamish about blood don’t see this one!) It does get confusing and the subtitles felt very fast but overall I enjoyed the experience of this crazy wild film. I do wish it had dance and music like other Indian cinema I’ve seen like RRR and the  Baahubali films but this is enjoyable as well. So there you have it! I did it! That’s all the movies I’ve seen in the last few weeks! Merry Christmas to you and thank you for supporting my career and everything I do. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2023",With a decent villain portrayed by Ed Skrein&#44; fascinating visuals by Snyder&#44; and the promise of an impressive saga&#44; Rebel Moon is a safe start to a potential new space opera&#46;,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2023"," First things first, I did not hate Rebel Moon Part 1: A Child Of Fire. I didn’t love it, I didn’t hate it. I came away from the movie with mixed feelings. Then again, I have mixed feelings about the first Star Wars, which I do love, but which is undeniably a rough draft of what George Lucas and his collaborators eventually came up with across the original trilogy. Rebel Moon is not a trilogy, and that’s my first complaint. I am not a fan of these two-part movies. A movie should be one film or three films. Two is an awkward number, especially for what is obviously intended to be a major space opera epic. Too much and too little were attempted and achieved in Part 1. The pacing is a mess. It moves too slowly much of the time, yet the story—the important pieces like character development—are rushed through and glossed over. My second complaint is that so much of the movie makes so little sense. Yes, I can understand how a giant space empire needs food to feed its soldiers. No, I can’t see how a group of five or six warriors (even supplemented with three or four squads of rebel fighters) will be able to fight off a massive dreadnought ship and its battalions of well-armed troops. I liked the twist and the betrayal toward the end of the movie, but I thought the means by which our heroes escape quite preposterous. Who designed those scorpion chair robots? They’re very cool but...why would you make the paralyzing device the same as the key? And how would the farmer, Gunnar, know that? It would have made more sense for Kai to be playing a deeper, twistier game here. Rebel Moon Part 1 functions like the beginning of Seven Samurai or The Magnificent Seven or, well, The Three Amigos. A village comes under threat by a powerful enemy and a group of rough-around-the-edges heroes are gathered to help the villagers fight back. The problem here is scale. If Snyder had made the enemy a group of space pirates or some kind of evil space biker gang or something, fine. Even just a local officer manning this planet who cracks down to forcefully. But we’re talking about a massive, multi-star-system force that’s conquered known space and is willing to throw all its might at these villagers. I don’t buy it. The actual gathering of the heroes is also poorly paced. We get a massively extended scene of Tarak breaking and then riding a space griffon (with lots of Snyder slo-mo to slow things down further) torn straight out of the Harry Potter hippogriff scenes, but then when they find General Titus (a slovenly drunk now, but still ripped) it’s one motivational speech and off we go. Rebel Moon is basically PG-13 Star Wars in a lot of ways—you won’t hear that kind of language in a galaxy far, far away or have scenes with attempted sexual assault—but it’s never as charming or funny. The characters aren’t terrible, but the most likeable among them ends up being a bad guy. There’s not nearly enough comic relief, which directors like Snyder seem to never realize helps us care and bond with characters so that we care more when bad things happen to them. Comic relief helps create tension! I could go on and on about all the little things that didn’t make sense in this movie, but the long and short of it is simple: With a little more time and a stronger script, this could have been a tremendous space opera. Instead, it was merely enjoyable. I didn’t find it half so terrible as the reviews made it sound. All the “worst movies ever!” talk seems rather over-the-top and breathless to me. In fact, I’d say I like this more than any of Snyder’s films since the old days of 300, Watchmen and The Dawn Of The Dead. Sure, it’s derivative. So is Star Wars. I’m fine with derivative works, especially in the sword-and-planet genre. John Carter was around long before Dune. I don’t begrudge Frank Herbert for riffing off of Edgar Rice Burroughs, or George Lucas riffing off of Herbert and Akira Kurosawa, or Zack Snyder riffing off all of the above. I’ve had my own ideas for sword-and-planet-and-samurai stories. We’re all influenced by a million things. The problem with Rebel Moon is that it doesn’t do enough to establish itself as something unique and coherent. Maybe that will change when we have Part 2, but I wish Snyder had come up with some better hooks, some more obvious ways to make this universe special and distinct rather than just a hodge-podge of other people’s ideas. And yet, at the same time, it felt mostly very capable as a somewhat darker, edgier Star Wars, wooden characters and flimsy plot aside. I enjoyed the action and was mostly entertained throughout. If anything, it suffered from many of the same problems the sequel trilogy suffered from, which were often pacing issues. Recall, the original Star Wars trilogy did such a great job at two things: First, it gave us great characters we cared about; second, it spent meaningful time establishing a sense of place in each of its films. We got to know planets like Tatooine, Dagobah, Hoth, the moon of Endor, the Death Star, Cloud City and so forth. In the sequel trilogy and in Rebel Moon, the places we go are barely established at all and utterly forgettable. The characters have potential, but we hardly scratch the surface. Still, I like them for the most part. I like Sofia Boutella’s Kora (I almost titled this review, The Legend Of Kora) though I wish Snyder had picked better ways to reveal her past to us than long exposition-laden flashbacks. Charlie Hunnam’s Kai was a lot of fun, though he—like all the others—gets a little lost in the mix of introducing so many characters in so short a span. The robot, Jimmy, is an instant favorite thanks to the wonderful voice work from Anthony Hopkins. More Jimmy, please. Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus didn’t get enough screentime at all (perhaps half of these characters should have been introduced in the second movie in the fictional trilogy I wish this was) and Michiel Huisman’s Gunnar and Bae Doona’s sword-wielding Nemesis, not to mention the surprisingly sympathetic spider-monster-lady she fights. Meanwhile, the special effects, sound design, costumes and cinematography were all top-notch. I really liked this film’s take on laser blasters, which pop holes right through people. Nemesis’s swords aren’t quite lightsabers, though they looked like that in the trailer. Rather, they’re normal swords that heat up into glowing fire-blades. I just wish that all this attention to detail had been given a little more room to breathe—which is a sentiment I hold toward the characters and the dialogue as well. I suppose much of my enjoyment here is probably due to the exceptionally low expectations I came into the movie with. I was fully expecting it to be dreadful at every turn, but it was more like a fast food cheeseburger. Not bad, really, just nothing particularly unique and not the type of burger you’d get on a date. I enjoy a fast food burger from time to time, though. It can really hit the spot! Rebel Moon scratched that space opera itch I always have in the same way John Carter did when that movie came out and bombed with critics and audiences, and it did it without the Force. It’s no Andor, by any means, but it’s really no worse than the Star Wars sequel trilogy and I enjoyed it more than the prequels. At least there’s no Jar Jar Binks. I’m definitely going to watch Part 2 and I’m genuinely curious to see what happens. I’ll probably even watch the director’s cut when that comes out (though it should have just been that version from the start for goodness sakes!) which is something I didn’t have the stomach for with The Justice League.  Score: 3/5 — Rebel Moon is an entertaining but flawed space opera with some great action and cinematography that would have been better as the first part of an R-rated trilogy. Hopefully Part 2 builds on the opening film’s strengths. I would not complain if this became a larger franchise with more room to grow the universe and shape into something more unique.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023"," I can’t fault Zack Snyder for essentially giving us a sprawling remake of Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” when he seeks to build a new “Star Wars” for the modern generation. “Star Wars” was, as many know, a quasi-remake of “Hidden Fortress.” Another by Kurosawa. It all comes full circle, as Snyder seeks to build a massive mythology in the vein of “Star Wars.” He really wants “Rebel Moon” to be “Star Wars”; at the end of “A Child of Fire”—well—he creates a movie that has been done before but to a much better effect (ahem–“Firefly”). When a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, Kora, a mysterious stranger living among the villagers, becomes their best hope for survival. Tasked with finding trained fighters who will unite with her in making an impossible stand against the Mother World, Kora assembles a small band of warriors, all of whom have their own motives to for redemption and revenge against the evil tyrant Admiral Balisarius. We have an oppressive government, space cowboys, a rag tag group of rebels, a war torn hero with a shady past, it’s all here. Except it’s over two hours. But that, again, is no surprise as Snyder pretty much takes bits and pieces from a ton of science fiction, fantasy, and storytelling tropes and mixes and mashes them together. So many instances feel reminiscent from better epics like “Lord of the Rings,” “Heavy Metal,” “Avatar,” and the like. In effect, Snyder creates a tonally confusing and painfully predictable stew that is never quite sure if it’s thought provoking science fiction or a silly action serial. For a director who is a very good visualist (some scenes are just absolutely striking), Snyder spends too much time with characters dropping huge dumps of information and exposition on the audience. Snyder is deadest on establishing this lived in universe, thus every character has a story or legend to tell and it falls victim to monotony almost immediately. When characters aren’t sitting down to offer testimonials as a means of setting the stage for the sequel, “Rebel Moon” spends a lot of time staging action scenes as a means of setting up characters. These individuals feel more like players in a video game more than anything, never allowing us to fall in love with them. There’s the humble shaman, and the quiet sword wielder, and misanthropic war veteran, all of whom basically check off boxes in the grab bag of plot elements from the genre. Beneath a lot of the action there’s what is basically a paper thin premise involving a Nazi-like government, and the rising rebel tide. Sophia Boutella is a beautiful and striking actress, but her heroine Kora feels so old hat, and transplanted out of a C tier early aughts scifi film. Meanwhile the villainous Belisaurius appears every so often to remind us of the stakes in the story. Snyder spends a majority of “Child of Fire” setting up storylines and propping sub-plots for the follow up, which distracts from any momentum the current narrative tries to build. And what makes it all feel so fruitless is that he’s promised a Director’s Cut with even heavier focus on mythology. The sad aspect is that “Rebel Moon” just isn’t interesting enough to venture in to the deeper more comprehensive mythology as there’s not a lot of reason to return to any of it. Snyder die hards might end up loving it, but “Rebel Moon” is boiler plate scifi slop that just doesn’t make an impression at all.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023"," The first part of Zack Snyder’s ambitious, long-cherished space opera, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire looks suitably impressive: the story unfolds against vividly realised worlds, starting in an idealistic agrarian commune on an out-of-the-way moon, and travelling through cobalt mining planets, gritty desert outposts and lunar dive bars. The fight sequences are decent, if a little over-reliant on self-important slow-motion shots of people clobbering one another with space axes. But the story is a derivative mess that feels as though it was assembled from bits of plot picked off the carcasses of other, better films, and glued together with brain-numbing, pace-killing chunks of exposition. Sofia Boutella shows action-star potential as Kora, a mysterious outsider who has found peace living with the farming commune, but she deserves a better vehicle than this chop-shopped jalopy.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 24, 2023"," The Zach Snyder mythos grows larger every day. The director became a polarizing figure in his DC films era, but his ability to create indelible images never wavered. Since his 2004 The Dawn of the Dead, Snyder could elevate his projects with vivid imagery. Yet some of his stories have fallen short of his potential. Sadly, Rebel Moon – Part One continues that trend. Despite some genuinely jaw-dropping moments, thin characters and overused tropes sink what might have been Snyder’s triumph as a filmmaker.  Snyder’s latest follows Kora (Sofia Boutella) – a woman hiding from the galaxy in a small farming village. However, her past resurfaces when an imperialistic force – known as the Motherworld – arrives. With the help of local Gunnar (Michael Huisman), Kora begins to collect a group of warriors to fight the Motherworld. Soon, Titus (Djimon Hounsou), Kai (Charlie Hunnam), Tarak (Staz Nair), Nemesis (Doona Bae), and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) make up her elite team. However, Regent Balisarius (Fra Free) and Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) hunt the crew to stop their growing cause.  On its face, Rebel Moon joins a long tradition of films nodding to past cinematic achievements. Star Wars once drew from Flash Gordon. The Knives Out series pulls from Agatha Christie stories. Even Indiana Jones pulls from old serial films. However, each of these stories found unique twists and turns based on the tropes these genres created. Like playing an arrangement of a musical piece, the flourishes of the individual musician help sell the unique experience. Sadly, Snyder plays into these tropes, rather than finding his own tune.  The character shells quickly make Rebel Moon overly predictable. Snyder plays into these moments as shorthand yet overloads the film with exposition. Strangely, Rebel Moon suffers from having too many tropes, while simultaneously crafting lore that many will find challenging to follow. While this could mean the feature has impressive world-building, the lack of ambition in the storytelling undercuts the franchise’s potential future. Not a single thing a character does in this film will surprise you either.  Synder certainly provides plenty of hero moments to each character, but he also zaps any tension from these moments. Again, the overly predictable nature of each character removes all dramatic tension from any moments that could make for interesting battles. This, combined with costuming that tells us exactly which “type” of character we’re interacting with, leaves little for the audience to discover. Without personal moments where we fear for our heroes, we simply lose interest. Even when one character acts selflessly, the sequence borders on comedy. It’s as if Zach Snyder is allergic to sentimentality despite telling an underdog story. This may ultimately doom his franchise.  Watching Rebel Moon was less of a chore than one might expect. Yet at the same time, that does make it a good movie. Much of the humor, comes unintentionally (a particularly yonic and phallic opening to the movie-inspired laughter from this critic and throughout the theater). The CG creates some spectacular moments, but the lack of emotion within the story turns Rebel Moon Part One into a checklist of a movie. As we assemble the crew, in order, the rhythm and purpose of Snyder’s latest dwindles. With a second part coming in early 2024, and a director’s cut already promised, perhaps Snyder can salvage his original franchise. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2023"," If there were FYC screeners for the Razzie Awards, I'm quite confident I'd have received one for Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire along with the usual hardbound picture book, a t-shirt that doesn't fit, a moon-shaped stress ball, and a coupon for 10% off admission to Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver.  Alas, Snyder's only hope for not taking home a multitude of Razzies this year lies in this film's late release and the distinct possibility that those always unpredictable Razzie voters have already made up their minds.  So, let's just state the obvious upfront. Rebel Moon is not a good film. Rebel Moon is a bad film that makes other bad films look better. It made me briefly contemplate the idea that M. Night's The Last Airbender wasn't really all that bad. Fortunately, I changed my mind. Rebel Moon made me briefly think that Tom Cruise's The Mummy wasn't actually godawful. Again, I changed my mind.  In Rebel Moon, a peaceful colony on the edge of a galaxy finds itself threatened by a tyrannical ruling force. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a mysterious stranger who lives among them and becomes their best hope for survival. Assembling a small band of warriors - outsiders, insurgents, and orphans of war - she leads battle over the fate of a galaxy. A new army of heroes is formed.  It's important to note that Rebel Moon: Part One is, in fact, the first of a two-parter and one can only hope that we're in for a heck of a lot more story with the second go-round (I doubt it, but one can hope).  When the bad guys arrive, they subsequently demanded the village's entire harvest. They immediately eliminate the village's leader, an act returned by our dear Kora who takes out some soldiers. She is joined by Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and essentially the film takes off to recruit the warriors who will defend the villagers. These recruits will include:

Charlie Hunnam's Kai, whose performance here is the film's highlight as he at least infuses the proceedings with genuine energy and heart. 

Djimon Hounsou's Titus, a rebel general who's skills are undeniable yet who is also seen as a disgraced man. Part one doesn't take us deeply into this journey or this conflict. Instead, it's like a 2+ hour recruitment video with journeys to different planets, the obligatory battles, and weakly assembled origin stories for each character. The script, co-penned by Snyder with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, never quite lives into its even basic description and exists with limp dialogue, almost zero meaningful character development, and a narrative that is about as murky as the worlds being created here.  This is not to mean, however, that Part One never works. There are moments that hint at Snyder's intentions here and moments when the film's visual palette clears and becomes rather impressive. There are moments that make you think ""Now, we're going to get going."" Unfortunately, Rebel Moon never gets going.  There will, of course, be those who appreciate Rebel Moon for what it is and that's fine. They're wrong. Rebel Moon: Part One - A Child of Fire is, in fact, simply a cinematic misfire of epic proportions. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023"," You could read Zack Snyder’s latest transgalactic travesty as, in part, an apology for Sucker Punch, his notoriously chauvinistic 2011 romp. Sofia Boutella is not prancing around in exotic lingerie or cooing like an eroticised adolescent. She speaks in arid quips. She wears a properly concealing cape. She punches giant lizards in the face. Kora, the protagonist, is, in short, Regulation Girlboss #349. A role model for the ChatGPT generation. If you want to avoid cliche and overworked influence you have come to the wrong place. The word on Rebel Moon: Part One – no space armada can halt an incoming second spurt – is that Netflix has allowed Snyder, director of 300 and lots of DC rubbish, to develop his own take on Star Wars. That’s not an insane precis. The film follows a plucky band of insurgents as they take on an apparently indestructible fascist regime. Kora is Luke Skywalker. Someone else is Han Solo. There is a cute robot. But the familiarities go back further – deep into the inspirations for the first part of George Lucas’s space opera. If Star Wars didn’t exist critics would be focusing here on the shameless references to Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. It’s not just that the characters gather together a band (of around about that number) to protect a literal and figurative village from marauders. Rebel Moon is also much at home to pseudo-Japanese set and costume design. The awful thing also plays like yet another gift for the Johnny One-Books who still jaw about Joseph Campbell’s The Hero with a Thousand Faces. Campbell and Kurosawa were, of course, the godfathers of Star Wars. Anyway, never mind all that. The undemanding punter is allowed a slab of mindless space mayhem to while away the yawning afternoons during the Christmas break. Right? As so often with Snyder, one wishes the project were as much fun as it seems on paper. To be fair to the guy, he did discover a sense of humour for the recent, tolerable Army of Thieves, but, though there are attempts at levity here, we are, for the most part, stuck with his dreary stygian self-importance. You will get some sense of the subtlety at work from a summary of the opening section. A happy farming village is disturbed when a space vessel disgorges a legion of smartly uniformed straight-backs – garbed as you’d expect in a fascist-themed production of Julius Caesar – led by the reliably snake-eyed Ed Skrein. He smiles and opens negotiations to appropriate grain for his troops. At least one local reacts like the character in Mad Max 2 who, confronted with the mountainous villain, declared: “This Humungous ... is a reasonable man.” Well, no. After more preamble than is strictly necessary, Lord Skrein, or whatever he is called, takes to battering the citizens to death and stripping the land. “It’s simple. I want everything,” he says. You amaze me, Man in Jackboots and Shiny Peaked Cap. Kora – as so often in Campbellian tales an adoptee to the village – finds herself tasked with assembling a gang to fight back against the oppressors. What we end up with is a colossal, colossally boring preamble to a less-meandering second part that will, I’m guessing, appeal largely to viewers with screwdrivers lodged in their frontal lobes. There are endless hunks of spoken exposition. There is a lot of space travel. A great many uninteresting people are introduced. By the first hour all narrative drive has slackened into a limp connecting thread. One thing does interest, though (if you’ll excuse the spoiler). A surprising number of the worst villains turn out to be Northern Irish or white South Africans. How amusing it would be if the DUP were to call for a boycott.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023",Rebel Moon&apos;s failure to meet its potential is a shame&#44; as it appeared that Zack copied the answers from the George Lucas test&#46; The lack of originality of the story and characters was shocking to me&#44; considering it&#8217;s from a creative mind like Zack&#46; ,NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023"," If I’m understanding the stories behind the creation of the latest opus from filmmaker Zack Snyder, it was conceived as a possible Star Wars movie. For whatever reason, that didn’t work out, so he retooled it (emphasis on “tool”) into what is now a two-part science-fiction adventure tale, Rebel Moon, the first part of which is subtitled Part One: A Child of Fire. Personally, I love the idea of Snyder casting his overly serious, effects-heavy aesthetic gaze over a Star Wars movie, but for those of you bummed out that that film never saw the light of day, don’t worry: there’s still plenty of familiar plot and character elements contained within A Child of Fire to satiate many a Star Wars fan…maybe. But even more so, the film borrows heavily from a handful of Akira Kurosawa movies, the ones that served as a heavy inspiration for Star Wars as well. In other words, you’re either going to really love all of these visual and plot touchstones, or you’re going to be furious with them. The film begins on the farming planet Veldt, where a young woman named Kora (Sofia Boutella) crash-landed a few years earlier and was taken in by the peaceful residents, including the community’s leader (Corey Stoll) and the man she ultimately farms with, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), who is clearly in love with her. She seems disinterested in attachments, even in a place where having sex to inspire a good harvest is encouraged among the entire population, partly because of her mysterious past. We’re given an elaborate backstory among the state of the universe and the various sides waging war for supremacy via a narration from Anthony Hopkins. We first think he is just a narrator, but we soon find out he is an ancient mechanized protector named Jimmy who has lost its will to fight when its king was killed. Before long, a garrison led by Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein, in full reptile mode), an emissary of the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), arrives on the planet in search of a steady supply of food. At first, he demands whatever surplus this planet might have, but then he simply demands everything, leaving Kora in a position to save those who rescued her from certain death. They are given only a couple months to pull together their harvest, and a small detachment from the so-called Motherworld is left behind to harass and make sure the farmers give up all of what they harvest. Kora ends up killing most of them in an attempt to save someone from being brutalized by the enemy, but doing so forces her and Gunnar to leave the planet to scour the galaxy in search of fellow protectors to help save their planet, thus kicking off this particular space scavenger hunt. The details of the rest of the story are unimportant since most of the film has Kora and whoever happens to be with her hopping from planet to planet, space station to space station, looking for those hurt by the Motherworld, eventually leading her to a group of insurgents (the rebels in question) known as the Bloodaxes, led by the brother and sister team of Darrian and Devra (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman). On their journey, they meet up with a pilot and gun for hire named Kai (Charlie Hunnam); the fallen General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary commander; master swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae); Tarak (Staz Nair), a captive with a regal past and a gift with animals; and Milius (E. Duffy), a somewhat generic resistance fighter. The group fight together, sacrifice for one another and eventually stage a massive battle against Noble and his army. In true Zack Snyder fashion, the battles are massive, the use of special effects (most of them quite impressive) is constant, and the slow motion button is pushed frequently. Also, the image on screen is often murky, which for a story this epic shouldn’t be the case. Make it look timeless, and not like the film was shot on parchment. An accomplished dancer before turning to acting, Boutella’s ability to handle complicated choreography is on full display in some of her fantastic fight sequences, and the film’s adherence to the plot of The Seven Samurai is admirable, I suppose.  There are no real issues with the story being told here, and I do like that Snyder is taking on an actual space adventure story in a time when they are in short supply outside of a superhero framework. It’s more about the way Snyder tells his stories visually that is the issue, and so much of this story is clearly lifted from other, better movies, that it’s tough not to feel let down. I found myself laughing at parts of Rebel Moon, sometimes at moments that I think are meant to be funny (Skrein’s uniforms, which are clearly modeled after Nazi-wear, are so ridiculous, I dare you not to stifle a chuckle). But for the most part, I was inspired by this movie to re-watch other films. It’s not a complete disaster, and I’m a little curious how Part 2 finishes the story that basically comes to a definitive conclusion (no cliffhangers here), but A Child of Fire is largely a whiff.

"Dec 23, 2023"," From his critically maligned but fan-favorite Sucker Punch to his infamous internet darling “Snyder Cut” of 2017’s Justice League, Zack Snyder is no stranger to drumming up discourse whenever one of his films nears release. His latest effort for Netflix, Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, has already sparked discussions of an R-rated, three-hour director’s cut to give his fans an alternate taste before Rebel Moon — Part Two hits the streaming platform early next year. But while Snyder may do his best to invent a dark, gripping universe to engross viewers, Rebel Moon is a limp, soulless regurgitation of tropes stolen from much more formidable films. Written, directed, produced, and shot by Snyder, Rebel Moon follows Kora (Sofia Boutella), a battle-hardened soldier with a tragic past. Though she’s attempting to live a low-profile life on a peaceful farming colony, Kora is forced to once again take up the mantle of warrior when the Motherworld sends a military contingent led by the brutal Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) to occupy her new home. With the help of a humble farmer (Michiel Huisman) Kora sets off on a galaxy-spanning adventure to recruit a ragtag group of fighters to defend her homeland. Attempting to establish an original, engrossing science-fiction world is no small task, even for the most adept of writers, and it’s painfully clear that Snyder took heavy aesthetic and stylistic notes from genre classics like Star Wars and Dune, without understanding the story and emotional beats that made those aforementioned franchises so beloved. Certainly, there’s all manner of science-fiction spectacle in Rebel Moon to gawk at: the characters are all dressed in tattered greyscale robes, wielding retrofuturist weapons and talking about the “Motherworld” and the “Imperium.” But while every element of production design, costuming, and worldbuilding is certainly specific, none of them are inspired or purposeful. Instead, Rebel Moon’s stylistic sensibilities feel like Snyder simply tossed all the sci-fi greats into a blender and called it a day. Extensive attention is paid to plotting out  lore and history, but Snyder forgets to flesh out the characters that populate his meticulously detailed universe. Aside from Kora, whose tragic backstory and brutal upbringing are delivered entirely through clunky monologues of exposition that bleed into extensive flashback sequences, the rest of Rebel Moon’s sizable ensemble cast are eacg allotted five minutes of dialogue, if that. Kora and her crew flit to a new planet, are treated to a dazzling display of their new ally’s combat prowess, given the CliffsNotes version of their tragic backstory (is there any other kind?), and then that character simply falls in among the ranks, never to be examined or explored with any real intentionality again. As for Kora herself, Boutella brings the customary strength and stoicism expected of a YA dystopian protagonist with none of the heart or passion. Constantly glowering out from underneath her dark crop of hair, Kora is a painfully uninteresting hero whose stoicism is certainly understandable given her history, but whose personality could not make for a more tepid protagonist. Though she’s plenty ferocious in combat, Kora is detached and distant when not embroiled in a fight, giving the entire film a remote, inaccessible emotional core. At two hours and 15 minutes, Rebel Moon is a laborious moviegoing experience—why should the audience care about the film’s events when the protagonist herself barely seems to?  Rebel Moon’s lack of interest in exploring its own characters is made all the more frustrating by the cruel, visceral nature of its villains—while we don’t get much personality from Kora, Gunnar, and the other wannabe heroes, we are treated to several extended sequences that revel in the cruelty and violence of the Imperium. The vaguely fascist ruling faction is clearly an underbaked stand-in for Star Wars’ Empire, but Snyder mistakes onscreen brutality for effective writing. The film’s first act subjects viewers to an extended sequence of Imperium soldiers attempting to rape a villager, a scene that serves no other purpose than making explicitly clear to the audience that the authoritarian military occupiers are, in fact, bad guys. The world Snyder has created is a cold, brutal one, utterly lacking in any kind of charm, whimsy, or excitement. The closest Rebel Moon ever comes to eliciting any kind of emotional response is during the action-packed, slo-mo heavy combat sequences. Stories like Star Wars and Dune soar by using far-fetched worlds and fantastical settings to interrogate relatable, deeply human ideas. Rebel Moon, on the other hand, trades in the aesthetic trappings of those classics without making the effort to engage on any emotional or philosophical level. Though Rebel Moon ends on a relative cliffhanger with the promise of a sequel on the horizon, it’s difficult to imagine why one would want to subject themselves to  another two hours in this soulless slog of a universe. Certainly, Snyder is a master of his particular brand of highly stylized action sequences, but the sheer lack of emotional stakes and memorable characters renders Rebel Moon toothless.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2023"," NOW ON NETFLIX! Things are getting mighty funky behind the sky in the first installment of director Zack Snyder’s galactic epic Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child Of Fire. A dynasty of a thousand kings has ruled a slab of space, but that is all over as the last of the bloodline was assassinated. Down on the farm on some backwater planet, Kora (Sofia Boutella) is hard at work behind a plow. Her co-worker Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) oversees the grain harvested and seems to have a sweet on her.  However, their planet is invaded by Nazi-like space tyrants who are taking over civilizations or wiping them out in the memory of the slain king. At first, the villagers believe they could cooperate with Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), the leader of the death squad that has landed. Kora warns them that the tyrants will take and take until nothing is left, but the villagers find out the hard way. Kora goes to flee the village but is waylaid when the invaders try to trap her and another village girl in a gang rape. Soon, Kora has to travel to the worst spots of her planet and beyond to recruit a band of outcasts and outlaws that can defend her village against the deadly dreadnaught. If you think you have heard this story before, think again. First off, know going in that I am not a Snyder absolutist. I am underwhelmed by half of his work, though I am quite overwhelmed with the other half. Watchmen never got as interesting as its opening credits, and Army Of The Dead was a dud. However, Justice League: Justice Is Gray is possibly the most beautiful black and white movie I have ever seen, and I appreciate his dark slant on the Superfriends. So, while I was curious about Rebel Moon, I also wasn’t going to forgive any missteps.  So I spent the first 40 minutes picking the s**t out of it. Everything seemed subdued and pedestrian, with the only grandeur supplied by the soaring soundtrack. Then Snyder does what Lucas did with the Cantina and whips out the monsters. Suddenly, we start to get an inkling about how far out we are going to be taken. Then, Snyder widens the scope of the visuals with each major movement. So, instead of a sprint from start to finish, the script by Snyder with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten climbs a set of stairs instead, getting higher and higher into its concept. It is the perfect example of what the great critic Quentin Crisp called the crucial variety of tone. I appreciate the thoughfulness of your analysis. Myself, I’m a simple person, and I thought it was a big bucket of dumb. I thought there was “excessive grain obsession”. A galactic empire – capable of wormhole (one supposes) travel – has a tough time with agriculture? But whatever. One man’s grain is another man’s MacGuffin. I turned off my brain at about the 25 minute mark and just watched the gunfights.  On the plus side, many of the visuals were top notch. Some of the action sequences were well done. And despite it all, I will watch the next one …. once. Because who don’t like explosions?    At the end of the day, we did have a legitimate plan.

"Dec 23, 2023"," There’s usually some kind of disturbance in the force happening when there’s a 50 per cent difference between critical and public review ratings of a film on Rotten Tomatoes, and Zack Snyder’s initial cut of his $166 million space opera for the Netflix streamer is very the much the kind of project which revolts the snooty glitterati but delights the casual viewer. With Part Two in the can, as we say in the biz, and scheduled for April next year, Snyder is hoping to launch The Scargiver as the first of a trilogy of sequels to this opener, and while this critic admittedly came to scoff at Snyder’s efforts, A Child of Fire is a better-than-decent slice of crowd-pleasing sci-fi with a young, game cast, slick visuals and some wild ideas. With this year’s Barbie included, it’s fashionable to bash Snyder, and I certainly saw a chance for snark when I read the following on the film’s Wiki page ‘On June 8, 2022, it was announced that Anthony Hopkins had joined the cast as the voice of Jimmy, an impossibly sentient JC1435 mechanized battle robot and one-time defender of the slain king.’ Hopkins even narrates the opening sequence, and his robot knight has a quasi-messianic yet pagan look, garlanded with flowers and antlers, which fits right in with the semi-religious feel of the Rebel Moon universe. If Star Wars adopted the key elements of Kurosawa’s Hidden Fortress, then Snyder has the right to do something similar with Seven Samurai, itself the basis for John Sturges’ The Magnificent Seven and Roger Corman’s Battle Beyond the Stars (1980). So, the monarchy-loving, militaristic empire of the Motherland have sent the horrid Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and his doomy dreadnaught space-ship The King’s Gaze to oppress the sexy, funky planet of gardeners that is Veldt, where their work ethic sounds like a Kool and the Gang song; ‘Make Love Tonight!’. Yes, on lyrical, verdant Veldt, they’ve made a connection between hearty sex and a healthy lifestyle, and are preparing for the rumpy-pumpy which will infuse their crops; ‘the sound of our pleasure will summon the seedlings!’ This fertile ritual sounds like it might be fun to watch, but before they can get down on it, Noble’s men put a damper on their pastoral ardour by demanding a Biblical tithe; ten weeks to generate a tribute of many thousand bushels. That gives rebel Kora (Sofia Boutella) and her farmer pal Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) less than three months to find some more tough guys and gals to stand up to Noble and take down his battle-cruiser to start a rebellion against authoritarian might. ‘We’re from a small village looking to hire some fighters’ is the all-you-need-to-know takeaway about Kora’s age-old mission. So sure, we’ve been here before, but not with Snyder who injects some surprising elements into a classic space opera story of feuding Hawkshaws and Bloodaxes, and not just his Peckinpah-in-zero-gravity action style shown off to good advantage here. Snyder also skips making this space-adventure primarily for kiddies, and as the opening text warns, there’s a strong elements of sexual threat, from the Mines of Daggus to the brothel/cantina that Kora unwisely seeks help in. Rebel Moon rises to a Jodorovsky look at times, notably Noble’s henchwomen are straight out of The Holy Mountain, and the baddies really are bad; if Zack Snyder think that it’s a bad thing to ‘relish the ecstasy of combat’ like the Motherland does, you’re pretty far gone, and it’s probably for the best that we don’t get to see Noble get his desired wish to ‘split that sapling’ when confronted by Kora. Is Kai, the mercenary pilot hired by Kora and played by Charlie Hunnam, a reliable soul or not? Can Fabio-style Prince Tarak (Staz Nair) tame his giant crow and find true happiness? Why does Ed Skrein cuddle up with a sexy snake that seems to poke through various orifices in his torso? There’s literally tonnes of Dune-lite world-building going on here, and Rebel Moon generally looks good, with Snyder clearly invested in his universe of mechanical bounty hunters, teeth-rattling conflicts and astral energy, with a notably strong sound-design and score to keep things interesting. Of all the festive blockbusters for 2023, this is probably the we’re getting closest to an Avatar-style epic, and those who seek a blast of outer-space action should get their interstellar kicks on Snyder’s Rebel Moon. Come on, Bunty, this is big sci-fi action fantasy fun, don’t deny yourself! You can watch it on your new Nokia flip-fone! Live the dream! Hopkins gives it his all; he puts such feeling into his opening narration, even if neither he nor I could understand it. He certainly keeps busy, and while his work on Shadowlands and The Remains of the Day is widely admired, to me, he’ll always be Jimmy the sentient droid. Sure, it’s space Nazis again, when is it not? But intergalactic pagan sex harvests is new. Don’t pretend you’re not intrigued. Actual sci-if ideas bolted into a Western plot, as per. I have read that there is an extended cut that is what Snyder really wanted to do, and the same with part 2 and they will be released once the short versions have been put out, so sometime next year. Netflix wanted the pg13 version first so kiddies can watch it and Snyder wanted an R rating so they let him do both. I might hang on for those. Even in this family friendly PG-13 version, there’s a few scenes where we’re clearly looking at horrible off-screen scenes which are about the be put back in for the Snyder-cut. But this is way more adult than Aquaman 2 and is worth your time; don’t listen to snobby critics! I’m pushing against a tide here, but I liked this a lot more than I expected. Feel free to post a link with your alternative view! Pretty impressed. Given all the critical fuss I expected to stop watching pretty quick. Instead, I found it very enjoyable and aimed at an adult audience – which Oppenheimer and Barbie have proved beyond doubt exists.  Fairly zimmed along and the climax took me by surprise. I was expecting something more dour and leaden. Though I did think it was Richard Attenborough’s plummy voice doing the opening narration. I knew it was Hopkins, probably for the price of a Picasso; he reads that text with such feeling and so ripely! I was totally ready for a hate watch, but had to restart after twenty minutes when I realised it was good. Better than Guardians or The Flash or Ant-Man or the vast majority of what’s out there. And like you, I thought the climax was sharp and came up suddenly, no messing around. Barely one in five critics thought this was passable, but I’m happy to be in a minority. Join the Rebellion!

"Dec 23, 2023"," You may be tempted to further curse the existence of the Star Wars prequels for seemingly informing the upsettingly turgid sci-fi epic Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire (now on Netflix), the first volley in a planned megafranchise from love-him/hate-him filmmaker Zack Snyder. Let it be known that I’m no knee-jerk Snyder hater – I’ll still defend Watchmen and some aspects of 300, and for my nickel, 2021’s amusing Army of the Dead kinda redeemed him after making a few pretty terrible Superman movies. But Rebel Moon finds him leaning on his worst Snyderesque tendencies, not the least of which is releasing this, the first of a two-parter, which reportedly will be followed by an extended R-rated cut, and then Part Two – The Scargiver (confirmed for April 2024 release), and then an extended R-rated cut of that one, and then probably a gigantic 193-hour megacut of both films that’s sure to feature more stultifying exposition and overstylized violence than anyone of sound mind would ever want. As it is, the 133 minutes of A Child of Fire already feels like way more than enough.  The Gist: We open with – wait, is that Anthony Hopkins narrating? Yes it is. A bona-fide knighted Englishman with Oscars on his shelf has now been in both a Michael Bay Transformers movie and a Zack Snyder movie, the latter of which features him giving voice to a blatant C-3PO ripoff while we scratch our heads and groan. And we haven’t even gotten to the what of Hopkins’ narration, which immediately buries us in backstory, and is not at all a particularly good way of opening a movie. Let’s just say the galaxy is ruled by an evil empire of Space Nazis – they even have the hats and epaulets and shitty haircuts and everything – cruising around in warships that look like flying U-boats, conquering the living saliva out of the worlds they come across. And as these things go, a revolution brews and stews on some secret planet somewhere. Needless to say, if you’re a Space Nazi, that revolution must be squashed like a squash you’d stomp with your jackboot. MEANWHILE, on a small nothing of a moon, some humble farmers farm the soil and say things like, “We’re just humble farmers. We have no interest in your politics,” you know, cornball shit like that. One of those farmers is Kora (Sofia Boutella), who of course isn’t just a farmer. You also getting some major More Than What She Seems vibes from this lady and her silently brooding brow? Of course you are. Kora exists among peasants bronzed by the sun and rendered lean by hard work and clad like 18th-century quakers. They are truly a chamber pot society who couldn’t stand up against fascist cretins with spaceships and laser guns, which is exactly what happens when evil fartknocker Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and his rapey Proud Boy soldiers show up to sexually assault the women and take the harvest. Atticus leaves some of his cruel turdburglars in charge, and that’s when Kora goes Wonder Woman on them, but only if Wonder Woman didn’t mind killin’ some folks. Turns out that Kora used to belong to the Space Nazis, and that’s how come she’s such a skilled whupper of asses. And now it’s on her to make sure all the humble farmers don’t get slaughtered, so she and generic guy Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) set off to assemble a crew. What kind of crew, you may ask? Is it ragtag? An assemblage of diverse types from various worlds? Maybe a guy who resembles a Native American warrior (Staz Nair)? A samurai-type woman (Doona Bae) with laser machetes because lightsabers have been very much done before? A smirking smuggler (Charlie Hunnam) with a jalopy airship? A could of heavily facepainted leaders of the standing rebellion (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman)? Djimon Hounsou in another utterly thankless supporting role? Sure. Why not cram a walking carpet in there while you’re at it. Throw them in a trash compactor maybe, before they face off against the galactic totalitarians. Now, if only this movie played out with the thrills and suspense of other movies that are just like this one. What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: It rhymes with “flar nores.” Also, some serious misguided ambition here a la Jupiter Ascending and the hey-they-only-released-half-a-sci-fi-epic frustrations of Denis Villeneuve’s Dune. Memorable Dialogue: A prime example of the dialogue, which is mostly meaningless mouthfuls of words, via Kora: “It seemed a myth or metaphor created in response to the generations of war and conquest,” she says, speaking like any normal person would. Our Take: Oh hi – you caught me looking up synonyms for “turgid.” Rebel Moon COLON Part One DASH A Child of Fire finds Snyder killing us slowly with relentlessly awful exposition, a marked lack of originality, boilerplate sci-fi characters, plot twists and betrayals with little dramatic impact and greenscreens greenscreens greenscreens. Oh, also Snyder’s trademark slo-mo, all the better for him to stage his heroes in iconic poses and either drive us nuts or force his fans to convince themselves that that shit is super cool, bro, and not at all cheesier than a Wisconsin truckstop.  Writing alongside Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, Snyder spends an inordinate amount of time schlepping his protagonists across the galaxy, Kora gathering up pals to help her out, the various locations identified by stultifying subtitles along the lines of GLADIATOR ARENA OF CASTOR – MOON OF POLLUX. Needless to say, by the time they get to UNREGISTERED TRADE DEPOT – GONDIVAL you’ll be checked right the eff out. The movie has a few notable moments where it threatens to get interesting; a “cantina” scene boasting a basketball-sized tabletop tick-creature that controls folks by sinking its slinky tentacles into their brains, or an encounter with a hissing arachnoid-woman who descends from the rafters with impressively evil ceremoniousness. Too bad that stuff amounts to nothing in the long run, tangents off the worn-out path from tranquil opening to noisy finale. Of course there’s a third-act battle, because without one, movies like this just don’t get funded. But if we actually possess the fortitude required to get to that point in the story, our emotional and intellectual investment in what happens will be a million-zillion half-pennies shy of giving a single good god damn about any of it. It doesn’t help that the story is about essentially nothing; the text here is so dense, it shoves the subtext straight into the fiery lava of the Earth’s core. Theoretically, in a world dominated by established IP we should be enthused by the idea of original sci-fi, but junk like this transcends theory into dispiriting reality. Don’t forget, all this is To Be Continued, just like Dune, but way shittier. And very much unlike Dune, the thought of sitting through another one of these is a depressing prospect. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2023"," Sofia Boutella plays Kora, a farmer with a secret past as a soldier, in director Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire.” (Photo courtesy of Netflix.) With the ungainly title “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire,” director Zack Snyder’s new monster-sized science-fiction franchise for Netflix launches with a lot of bombast and big action — but for several reasons, not just the ones hinted at by the title, it feels like an unfinished work. The movie starts on a bucolic planet, Veldt, and a young woman, Kora (Sofia Boutella), pushing a plow behind a horse-like creature. She’s a resident of a peaceful village — peaceful until a ship from the ruling Motherworld descends, led by the movie’s main villain, Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein). Atticus demands the village sell most of its grain harvest to his army, and even kills the village’s leader (an unbilled Corey Stoll) to put fear in the other villagers. Kora is not afraid, and we learn of her backstory that she’s not from this village — but a war-hardened former officer in the Motherworld’s army. The opening narration (by Anthony Hopkins, voicing an enigmatic android) explains that the king of the Motherworld was assassinated, and the power struggle that followed left the nasty Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) in charge, prompting a rebellion in the outer fringes of the empire. Gee, plucky rebels going up against a powerful evil empire, fighting wars among the stars — where do Snyder and his co-writers, Shay Hatten (who worked on Snyder’s “Army of the Dead”) and Kurt Johnstad (who worked on Snyder’s “300”), get their ideas? (Yes, the legend is that Snyder pitched himself to direct a “Star Wars” movie, and when Lucasfilm turned him down, he recycled his ideas into this.) Kora — who takes down the occupation force Atticus left in the village in one of Snyder’s familiar slow-motion action sequences — teams with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a villager who has sold surplus grain to the rebel side, to start assembling rebel fighters to fight against Atticus’ main forces when they return. Thus, Snyder engages in some universe-building, as we hop from one thoroughly production-designed planet after another.  Among those Kora and Gunnar pick up are: A homeless former general (Djimon Hounsou), a vengeful assassin (Doona Bae), a hunky prince (Staz Nair), a rebel leader (Ray Fisher, aka Cyborg from Snyder’s “Justice League”) and a roguish thief and space pilot, Kai (Charlie Hunnam).  Some of the action sequences Snyder devises are propulsive — my favorite is when Bae goes up against a spider-like creature with a head and thorax (played by Jena Malone) that resembles the Borg Queen from the “Star Trek” franchise. But, too often, Snyder falls into his regular habits, creating empty spectacle that’s quite violent, though bloodless enough to get its PG-13 rating.  The world-building is all in the visuals, with no attempt to guide viewers from planet to planet — and the character development is much the same, with only Boutella’s Kora provided much depth or explanation of who she is and how she got here. The audience is forced to fill in the gaps, using the clues of other movies Snyder references. And, perhaps the greatest crime of all for an action franchise, there’s absolutely no humor to lighten the heavy material. As the title tells us, this is the first installment of what has been announced as a two-part epic — the second part, with the subtitle “The Scargiver,” is scheduled for an April release on Netflix. And Snyder has recently said in interviews that this movie, which is two hours and 13 minutes long and carries a PG-13 rating, will have a three-hour, R-rated “director’s cut” released sometime next year. Yes, Snyder himself has succumbed to the allure of “the Snyder cut” that his legion of fans demanded after “Justice League.” The problem with announcing a “director’s cut” for “Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire” is that it tells us Snyder was so disenchanted with his movie that he started editing a different version as a distraction. If the director can’t be bothered to pay attention, why should the rest of us? Starts streaming Friday, December 22, on Netflix. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, sexual assault, bloody images, language, sexual material and partial nudity. Running time: 133 minutes.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023"," Since this film was announced it seems there have been two camps. Snyder’s die-hard fans (the same ones who successfully waged a multi-year campaign of pressure to push Warner Bros to release his cut of “Justice League”) heralded this movie as the coming of a darker, grittier “Star Wars.” Though, to clarify, this movie has nothing to do with “Star Wars.” That’s just the default when talking about sci-fi set in space. And the other camp were those who believe Snyder to be nothing more than a slow-motion enthusiast incapable of making a complete story without releasing 27 cuts of his movies. Despite an abysmal Rotten Tomatoes score and early crucifixion from other critics, “Rebel Moon” is a visually-stunning film that has a fun (though thin) narrative and interesting characters who all deserve more backstory. Any fan of “Seven Samurai” or “The Magnificent Seven” is already familiar with this story. A farm village on the independent world of Veldt is visited by a brutal space empire called the Motherworld. They demand grain from the village and vow to return and collect it. And a woman from the village named Kora (Sofia Boutella) has to assemble a ragtag team of warriors to defend the town. The story of “Rebel Moon” doesn’t think far outside the box. And that’s fine because obviously this is a setup that has worked in movies and television for decades. If it ain’t broke, right? Kora travels to nearby planets to assemble her team and recruits a former Motherworld general named Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a cyborg swordswoman named Nemesis (Bae Doona), a rebellion leader named Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), and an ex-prince who became a blacksmith named Tarak (Staz Nair). Together, they’ll have to defend Veldt against a brutal military machine led by the tyrant Balisarius (Fra Fee). He dispatches an admiral named Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to hunt for rebels, and he’ll be the one who leads the crushing attack against Kora’s home. If Kora’s team can’t stop him, Noble will plunder the village’s grain and leave so little behind that the people will starve. “Rebel Moon” is without question a film that puts style ahead of substance. And that’s an automatic sin in the eyes of some critics. But the movie makes up for its thin story and underdeveloped characters by having tons of visual aesthetic. It’s hard to understate how gorgeous this film is. Snyder offers up so many cinematic shots in between his trademarked slow-motion fight sequences. The aliens that inhabit this galaxy are all vibrant and distinct. And each recruit Kora comes in contact with just oozes cool with costume designs that wow and leave viewers wanting to see more. Through all of “Rebel Moon,” the only visual disappointment were the starships. Their designs are rather bland, and the CGI leaves them looking more like objects from an Xbox game rather than a sci-fi blockbuster. But everything else? Stellar. Snyder’s characters all offer hints of deeper story to come in the sequel. And with how much fun this initial outing was, “Rebel Moon” makes for an acceptable IOU with a promise for more grand adventure to come in part two. The film’s biggest issue comes down to relying on the tired trope of sexual assault to quickly establish who the movie’s villains are. “Rebel Moon” has two scenes of sexual assault, and the fact that both a man and a girl are the victims doesn’t exactly balance out. It’s an overused and harmful gimmick that needs to be retired. There are plenty of other ways to show just how evil a film’s antagonists can be that don’t rely on violently pulling assault victims out of the story for entire minutes at a time. “Rebel Moon” didn’t deserve to be shot down so viciously and quickly just because of the man behind the camera. It’s a fast-paced space epic that has a lot to offer. The film isn’t without flaws, but it’s nowhere near as bad as some would have audiences believe. It’s a world full of characters that all deserve much more in the future, and here’s hoping the sequel will deliver on their promises given in part one.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2023"," REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE. With Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Charlie Hunnam. Written by Zack Snyder & Kurt Johnstad & Shay Hatten. Directed by Zack Snyder. Rated PG-13 for sequences of strong violence, sexual assault, bloody images, language, sexual material and partial nudity. 133 minutes. On Netflix. Zack Snyder has made some dark films filled with action and visually compelling images. His latest is so epic it has been split in two, although the films were shot back-to-back. REBEL MOON: PART ONE – A CHILD OF FIRE is now available on Netflix. Its sequel – “Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver” will drop next April. While the first half takes off after a slow start, it is not a film that will be accused of originality. After a talky prologue where we gather that, as in “Star Wars,” the empire – called “the Motherworld” – is evil, the scene shifts to the bucolic planet of Veldt, where the simple farming community there could have been lifted from any number of westerns. The arrival of a ship helmed by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) is bad news. They want the crops to feed their troops, leaving behind a brutish force to ensure compliance. Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) tries to comply, but after Kora (Sofia Boutella) intervenes to prevent the rape of a young woman, she and Gunnar take off to seek warriors who can help defend their community. If this sounds familiar, it should, as it is the same premise as Akira Kurosawa’s classic “The Seven Samurai” (1954). The rest of Part One consists of their band growing including a thief (Charlie Hunnam), a defeated general (Djimon Hounsou), an expert swordswoman (Doona Bae), a former noble with a special ability with wild creatures (Staz Nair), and one of the rebel leaders (Ray Fisher). There’s even a sympathetic robot who will undoubtedly play a bigger role in the second film, voiced by none other than Anthony Hopkins. Of course each of the characters must get their own introductory vignette, and by the time they get back to Veldt the movie’s over and it’s time for next year’s follow-up. The problem here isn’t that it’s dull, but that you can practically see the serial numbers on what Snyder and his two co-writers lifted from other movies. Hunnam’s character enters in a scene reminiscent of the cantina in “Star Wars,” complete with a variety of alien characters. Nemesis, the swordswoman, has not one but two swords that strongly resemble light sabers. She battles a grotesque creature that’s half woman/half spider, and very similar to the Borg Queen in the “Star Trek” universe. One of their number turns out to be a traitor (paging Lando Calrissian from “The Empire Strikes Back”), while Admiral Noble seems to be modeled after the Nazi villain of numerous World War II dramas. The cast does their best not to make their characters two-dimensional with some even achieving all three dimensions, particularly Boutella since her Kora is given the most complete backstory, including flashbacks. The fight scenes and special effects are effective, although much more violent than in the “Star Wars” movies. That this got a PG-13 rating instead of an R shows how much more lenient the ratings board is with violence as opposed to nudity and sexual situations. Daniel M.

"Dec 22, 2023"," And now the diabolical director is zapping the enjoyment out of outer space, too, in “Rebel Moon — Part One: Child of Fire” on Netflix.  While that winding, buzzword-filled title sounds like a cheap-o parody of a science-fiction epic, this is about as unfunny and unadventurous a movie as you could possibly imagine. Our Tatooine rip-off is an orange-hued world called Veldt where a group of uptight grain farmers push around dirt all day long and then gather in a meeting house to speak like they’re Moses from the Old Testament. They sleep in what resemble 1800s Irish peat houses that are incongruously souped up with electric sliding doors and fluorescent lights.  Actually, the overall look of “Rebel Moon” is a grab-bag of mismatched time periods and multicultural visual references in a desperate attempt to be clever. However, because they so vastly overdo it, none of these places are believable even in the context of spaceships, reptillian aliens and villains named Balisarius (Fra Fee).  When the benevolent King of the Motherworld is slain and the totalitarian Regent (pretty much the Emperor from “Star Wars”) takes the reins, he sends a store-brand evil admiral named Atticus (Ed Skrein) and his jarhead henchmen to plunder and conquer.  The thugs demand Veldt hand over most of their precious grain supply, killing several citizens after they refuse. So, secret local badass Kora (Sofia Boutella) embarks on a mission with soft-spoken farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to recruit a crew of warriors to help the town. “I was taught that love is a weakness, and I don’t know how that will ever change,” Kora says. “To love and be loved — I don’t know if I’m capable of either.” Well, what I know is that when a character makes a cement-truck comment like that, they’ll probably tie the knot at the end of Part 2. The rescued townsfolk can throw some of that grain at the happy couple. Spinning-and-kicking Nemesis (Bae Doona) gets in an unpleasant bout with a half-woman-half-spider who is stealing another planet’s children. A once-powerful general named Titus (Djimon Hounsou) has slid into drunkenness. Tarzan-y Tarak (Staz Nair) gets his “Avatar” moment when he tames a wild flying horse and successfully rides it off a rocky cliff. Kai (Charlie Hunnam) is Han Solo. We don’t find out that much about any of these people, nor do we want to. The middle of “Rebel Moon” is a failed speed dating exercise in which a second meet-up is not in the cards. With a second chapter on the way, perhaps the clashing finale can be forgiven for being not so grand. One person dramatically sacrifices their life, and we shrug because we’ve only just met them a few minutes ago. Another double-crosses the group, and we shrug because we’ve only just met them a few minutes ago.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," Nothing causes something to fail at a goal like trying far too hard to achieve it. Whether it’s an individual trying to look tough or a science fiction story that wants the viewer to believe that it belongs among the great epics that came before it, those who observe these displays do not walk away convinced of the desired message, but rather, they walk away pitying the level of insecurity and neediness they project. While Rebel Moon Part 1 takes some big swings, it ultimately falls flat, trying to showcase too much, too fast, and leaving the viewer with that overwhelming feeling of desperation to impress. The movie opens with a sizable information dump as it lays out the important elements of the world’s history.Paired with the appearance of an impressive-looking starship coming out of this setting’s version of hyperspace, both audio and visuals set the tone and scale for the coming film. The CGI is crisp and clean, as will the visual effects be throughout the story’s two-hour and fifteen-minute runtime. However, this is the first element of many that leans into my above critique. ‘The film tries too hard to push the scale it boasts. One of the ways in which it does this is by calling out things like how the dynastic line of this empire had been unbroken for a thousand years. While this sort of scope is good to give a viewer, working it into a conversation rather than outright exposition avoids the feeling that it is there to impress, as opposed to building out a world seamlessly and naturally. From this initial display of the intimidating authority of the central government’s Imperial power, the film jumps to our small farming village, where we are introduced to the film’s lead, Kora (Sofia Boutella, Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities). Seen guiding a plow horse across a field with an enormous, red, ringed planet in the background, this shot is visually stunning. From here, the film begins its work to establish the idyllic life of this small farming village. It is a bit ironic that the sequence the film handles best is the one that has nothing to do with epic grandeur. The presentation of the town and the joyful, if simple, life it provides its people is filled with warmth and goodness. Kora is called from the field to participate in a feast, celebrating the coming planting and petitioning the gods to bless their future crops. Food, drink, and celebratory mating (don’t worry, it’s off-screen) are all on the menu. The sheer joyful energy that fills the gathering ensures that it will hit the viewer when the world comes crashing down around them. Sure enough, the next day, the residents of the village begin planting their crops, only to have their day disturbed by the appearance of a Dreadnaut class starship, King’s Gaze. Led by Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein, Alita: Battle Angel), the Imperial landing party brings demands of grain to support its troops as they root out local resistance elements. Here, we see Snyder’s vision come in with all the subtly of a sledgehammer. The viewer needs to know that the Imperial government is evil, and the film wastes no time in establishing this fact. Noble and his men go to such egregious lengths to showcase how bad they are that it borders on the ridiculous. Harm is not only directed at beloved leaders of the community, but the troops waste no time pushing far more indiscriminate violence upon the community, all but ensuring an eventual loss of compliance from the townspeople. These people aren’t just evil. They seem psychotic, so much so that it makes the viewer wonder how they could ever manage to build up such a grandiose empire in the first place. It also undercuts Noble as the major villain of the film. Science fiction tales are filled with intimidating bad guys that make not only their worlds’ but the audience themselves quake. Noble, sadly, does not fit this bill. Rather than a powerful threat, Noble comes across as a bully, one who has more likely earned his lofty spot in the Imperial Navy through family connections than success in combat or governance. Wedged in the middle of Rebel Moon Part 1’s opening descent into peril for the village is a perfect highlight for another of the film’s major failings: rushed character arcs. The rest of the time spent in the village is spent in a worldwide of introducing characters, speedily setting up an arc that feels like it could play out over the course of the entire film, only to see it resolve less than ten minutes after its introduction. Making the effect even more lessened is the fact that much of the drama that plays out is telegraphed beforehand, making the direction of these character narratives completely predictable. This madcap rush through character arcs continues throughout the story. Once the immediate situation is resolved, Kora, along with another farmer, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), seeks to make contact with those who may help defend the town from the retribution that will come once the empire learns that the troops left behind have been killed. For the next third of the movie, we are introduced to an assemblage of rough and ready fighters either looking to be heroes or simply out for vengeance. As each is recruited, we get a sequence showcasing their talents or the resources they bring to the enterprise. The movie is so hard-pressed to fit these entries in, though, that we get little time with the growing cast in between additions, making several of Rebel Moon Part 1’s final moments far less impactful than they are clearly intended to be. Sacrifices, betrayals, and heroic victories feel empty, even as the film does everything it can to push how impressed and dazzled the viewer should be. While the forced speed of the narrative makes story beats and characters never land, the actors themselves feel like they are giving their all to breathe as much life into their personalities as the plot permits. Charlie Hunnam works hard to craft the roughish smuggler energy his character is going for, while Djimon Hounsou breathes as much of the command presence his failed general persona can in the handful of moments he actually gets to speak. I genuinely felt sorry for the cast as they seemed to really feel for the roles they had been asked to bring to life but were never given the means to do so. Furthering the loss of impact for many of these moments is the less-than-stellar choreography in Rebel Moon Part 1. While I would never call it bad, it fails to create the image of skillful warriors it strives for. Kora is clearly intended to be a John Wick-level combat monster, slaying large numbers of enemies single-handedly. Sadly, the choreography never manages to make Kora feel nearly so deadly, and her opponents never feel like they are as hard a challenge as the ones delivered in the aforementioned franchise. Half of what makes a hero feel exceptional is overcoming a villain that is equally so. Kora is never given that chance, as her antagonists never fail to elevate themselves beyond forgettable cannon fodder. Even the climactic final one-on-one fight is against an opponent whose only melee accomplishment to that point is beating an unarmed man to death with a glorified walking stick. I should hope our mysterious, badass lead can handle him. The other thing that does the combat in Rebel Moon Part 1 no favors is Snyder’s continued obsession with slow motion. If you are one of the many who feels like overuse of this technique sucks the life out of combat sequences, you will not enjoy this ride. If you do, this film may be for you. The only element that shines brightly throughout Rebel Moon Part 1 is its score from composer Tom Holkenborg. From start to finish, the music is filled with sweeping themes, energetic fight music, and ominous tones that feel like they deserve to be attached to a better movie. It works so hard, but music in cinema is like the sauce on a steak, if the steak is overcooked, no amount of sauce can make it good, it can just make the meal pass a bit less painfully. While Rebel Moon Part 1: Child of Fire displays some strong visual effects and a gorgeous soundtrack, virtually everything else in the film fails. Rushed arcs, underwhelming combat, and the need to push the scale and grandiose nature of the setting bring the narrative down, making it underwhelming at best and outrightly bad at worst.

"Dec 22, 2023"," In Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire Zack Snyder (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel, Justice League) attempts to launch his own Star Wars-style franchise, beginning with two Netflix films and with plans for so much more. With Child of Fire, Snyder demonstrates the vast scope of his imagination, but at the same time, he fails to provide a compelling enough hook to pull viewers into that vast universe of ideas. What we get instead in Rebel Moon: Part One is a whole lot of ""telling"" and very little ""showing,"" with a lot of necessary backstory and characterization being delegated to the multitude of spin-off projects that are already in the works – including the ""real"" version of this very film, which already has an R-rated director's cut on the way.  The story of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire opens at a pivotal point in this universe's history: a sudden coup in the military empire known as the Motherworld. A princess gifted with the power of life is assassinated, and in her place stands Balisarius, a senator who seizes the power of Regent over the Motherworld, and renews its campaign of war and conquest across the galaxy. That war reaches the farming planet of Veldt, where the farmers are coerced by Balisarius' ruthless admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) into supporting the Motherworld and its war efforts with their grain harvests. When the farmers resist, Noble and his men turn savage on them – forcing local girl Kora (Sofia Boutella) to reveal her true identity as a former member of the Motherworld's elite warrior force, the Imperium.  When Kora finds herself exposed, and her adopted home on Veldt threatened, she joins pilot/mercenary Kai (Charlie Hunnam) on a journey across the galaxy to recruit other infamous warriors who hate Balisarius and/or the Imperium. The group Kora gathers is filled with souls as broken as they are skilled, and together they try to find either salvation, redemption, or both, by defeating Noble.  On a positive front, Rebel Moon is indicative of just what a talented visual creator Zack Snyder is. The world of this franchise is a clear hodgepodge of ideas from different genres and periods of history (sci-fi, fantasy, ancient mythology, Eastern influences like samurai and anime), and ideas unique to Snyder and co., all cooked together into one strange brew. The film inspires confidence that an entire franchise universe can be built off of this beginning – but then again, that potential for a bigger franchise comes at the cost of this standalone chapter.  Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire plunges us into this franchise universe as if we understand all the events that preceded it and the impact on the various characters. Little is done to make us feel those emotions and/or connections with the ensemble of characters – and it's impossible to fully understand how their individual stories inspire each character to form an unspoken bond with the others as warriors willing to die together. By the time the third act reaches the climactic battle and the guns are blazing, it's equally hard to feel any stakes or fear of losing anyone. It all plays out and, at best, it inspires the intrigue to learn more.  As for the cast, it's equally hard to gauge just how the actors approached their roles; if this standalone project was their sole focus for developing their characters, or were they playing out just a small part of a much larger arc that's been mapped out for them. Each of them is suitable in their parts, but not one of them is all that distinct, dynamic, or memorable. It feels like we get initial sketches of these players, but the real dramatic meat is being saved for later.  Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a flashy but hollow advertisement for the larger multimedia IP that will follow. Could we one day look back at this first chapter – with the full context of the franchise behind it – and feel more emotional impact about its events? Possibly, but that day is not today. ",NEUTRAL

"Dec 22, 2023"," Western sci-fi is littered with orientalist tropes, from touchstones like Dune to modern films like The Creator. So, it’s refreshing when something like Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire comes along, with its lucid view of imperialism that steers clear of that ugly influence. Unfortunately, the Netflix-produced space saga quickly squanders its storytelling potential after a powerful first act. It’s the rare Star Wars-based pastiche with somewhat innovative ideas—in fact, it was born from director Zack Snyder’s unrealized pitch to Lucasfilm about a Jedi version of Kurosawa Akira’s Seven Samurai—but the project’s two-part structure leaves this first entry feeling simultaneously overwrought and incomplete. The PG-13 Rebel Moon, now playing in select theaters, arrives on Netflix today with a sequel slated for April, but Snyder has already gone on record as saying his R-rated director’s cut for Part One—which, like the highly demanded “Snyder Cut” of Justice League, will probably stream at some point—is “almost like a different movie.” Upon watching the version Netflix has put out, it’s surprisingly easy to imagine a longer and superior edit. Much of the violence and characterization is implied, but rarely depicted, with intriguing characters being dropped from the movie wholesale while others spring up at random for only a few minutes of screen time. It’s as messy and haphazard as they come, and while the dichotomy of different cuts usually implies a tension or disagreement between studio and filmmaker, Snyder claims to have been in on the idea from the start. The film, therefore, feels incomplete on two fronts: Structurally, it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of a movie; and it also ends on a cliffhanger just as it’s getting started (a frequent problem in 2023, between blockbusters like Fast X and Across the Spider-Verse). It opens much like the Thor movies do, with voiceover from Anthony Hopkins imbuing extraneous exposition about millennia-old lore with surprising weight. None of it really matters—Hopkins’ voice scores scenes of enormous battle ships floating through space—since it’s the verbal equivalent of an opening Star Wars text crawl. All you need to discern from it is that there’s a space king somewhere, and that the story unfolds in his empire. Beyond that, information is conveyed in mostly character-centric ways, at least at first. The major setting is a quaint, Anglo Saxon-inspired agrarian community on Veldt, a planet colony lit by an enormous red star encompassing the entire horizon. Veldt is home to Kora (Sofia Boutella), a quiet, hardworking outsider who diligently plows the fields, even as her doting friend Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and her adopted father-figure Hagen (Ingvar Sigurðsson) gently suggest a suave local hunter as a potential husband. Kora has only been on Veldt a year, and marriage would be a way for her to become a full-fledged member of the community. While the idea of ethnicity doesn’t explicitly come up in dialogue, it hovers over every scene; Veldt’s villagers are all played by white actors putting on vaguely Scandinavian accents, while Boutella is Algerian. The specter of race becomes entirely unavoidable when a convoy of imperial officers—led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), right-hand man to the king—touches down on Veldt in search of rebels against the empire (known as “The Motherworld”). If it sounds exactly like Star Wars, that is perhaps the point, because it draws from the same well of influences and then multiplies them. The Empire in Star Wars was Nazi-influenced, but in Rebel Moon, the villains wear Nazi uniforms practically un-altered, except for a lack of actual Nazi insignia. The predominantly white soldiers all have either British or South African accents; the scars of real-world colonialism are woven into Rebel Moon’s creative DNA. These imperial forces play on the trust and naïveté of Veldt’s farmers, only to meet them with violence (Skrein is quite imposing in his role), and the only person who seems appropriately afraid is Kora, given that she’s not only seen this kind of violence enacted on her people, but she’s been a pawn to it herself, having been kidnapped and trained by the Motherworld as a child. In distinctly Snyder fashion, flashbacks in the form of vivid, slow-motion action tableaus take us through Kora’s backstory, as a victim of the Motherworld’s fascism, when her sandy home planet was invaded by ruthless military forces. This, too, screams Star Wars in concept, but it goes a step further. Rather than simply using a nebulous Middle Eastern setting, it invokes real-world imperial politics with a clear and direct rebuke of American foreign policy. The narrow streets and crowded buildings of Kora’s home world have hints of Islamic architecture, while the soldiers who unrepentantly reduce it to rubble are adorned with a beige-green armor overtly inspired by modern U.S. military gear. The film, in this way, aligns itself spiritually with George Lucas’s original Star Wars from 1977 which, in addition to modeling its villains off the Third Reich, sought to subtly critique the Nixon era of foreign policy, with the Empire being opposed by bands of scrappy militants organizing in jungles, akin to the Viet Cong. This United States-as-Empire trend would continue in Lucas’s early-2000s Star Wars prequels, which all but put George W. Bush speeches in its villains mouths during their power grabs, but the Disney-owned sequel trilogy of the 2010s would largely avoid such entanglements. Rebel Moon picks up that dropped political baton, by crafting a space opera in which the United States' prolonged “war on terror” in West Asia and North Africa is likened to Nazi occupation. These contemporary and realistic overtones are laced with plenty of fantastical elements too, from spaceships and laser weapons, to ceremonial guards with ornate masks and enormous red headdresses bearing witness to the soldiers’ merciless ambush, like a silent externalization of some unspoken religious fanaticism that’s driving the Motherworld. The first act sees Kora wrestling with how to respond to her place of refuge being invaded by familiar foes. Her first instinct is to run—it’s all she knows how to do—but when the battalion placed on Veldt attempts to sexually assault a local girl (this is a much rougher and grimier Star Wars), she’s forced to make a vital decision. She isn’t the only one, either. The film goes to great lengths to set up not one, but two conscientious objectors to this revolting act: a compassionate Motherworld soldier named Aris (Taiwanese actor Sky Yang), and a humanoid imperial robot, Jimmy (voiced by Hopkins), who has a change of heart after being shown kindness on Veldt. The flashpoint that kicks the plot into motion is this tiny act of rebellion staged by Kora, Aris, and Jimmy, involving guns, axes, and other blades, all filmed in Snyder’s signature speed-ramping style. From left, Doona Bae as Nemesis, Ray Fisher as Bloodaxe, Staz Nair as Tarak, Michiel Huisman as Gunnar, Sofia Boutella as Kora, Charlie Hunnam as Kai, E. Duffy as Milius and Djimon Hounsou as Titus in ""Rebel Moon."" Unfortunately, after meticulously building to this moment, this is also where the movie starts to break down. The action choreography, while fluid and conceptually stunning, falls victim to editing that sanitizes every bit of impact and bloodshed. It has echoes of brutality, but the film always cuts around violence, or presents it out of focus in the background. Once the sequence ends, and Kora has inadvertently attracted the wrath of the Motherworld, she and Gunnar are forced to embark on a secret mission to round up fellow rebels and soldiers to defend Veldt once Noble and his forces return. It’s Seven Samurai, the Japanese classic in which seven scattered fighters join forces to protect a village from bandits (re-adapted numerous times, including in Hollywood’s The Magnificent Seven and Bollywood’s Sholay), in all but setting and name. With four warriors already on Veldt’s roster, it doesn’t seem like it ought to be long before Rebel Moon gets to the action. Well, that would be true if there were any purpose to setting up Aris and Jimmy as such vital and interesting characters. But for some head-scratching reason, not only do they not join Kora and Gunnar on their quest, they also don’t show up in the movie again. As alluring as the film’s first 40 minutes may be, they aren’t followed by what you’d typically describe as a story either progressing, or building to anything of note. Instead, it simply cuts to Kora and Gunnar arriving on different planets (without scenes of them even traveling there) and recruiting various other potential fighters with their own histories against the Motherworld, in scenes that grow progressively truncated. Rebel Moon is essentially a first act followed by five more first acts—each shorter, faster, and more confounding than the last—in which brand new characters are introduced, seem reluctant to join the cause, but are quickly convinced to do so, usually by means of an empty speech from Kora that amounts to “So, you don’t want to fight…but what if you did?” (Cue triumphant music). Apart from Charlie Hunnam’s scumbag mercenary and escape pilot, Kai—who all but turns to the camera and says “I’m Han Solo, but with an Irish accent”—the litany of characters introduced on Kora’s journey do actually have the potential to be fun and interesting. Indian-Russian hunk Staz Nair plays Tarak, an enslaved indigenous man with a connection to animals (which, in this universe, include enormous griffons, resulting in an Avatar-inspired scene of a warrior connecting with a flying beast). Korean actress Bae Doona plays Nemesis, a cyborg and reluctant vigilante plucked from a gothic western, who wields flaming swords that may as well be lightsabers (she shows up fighting a spider-lady played by Jena Malone). But by the time the movie introduces the likes of washed up general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and sibling revolutionaries Darrian and Devra Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman), the screen time they’re afforded becomes increasingly condensed, until the movie devolves into less of samurai riff and more of a samurai parody, depicting the outward shape of familiar story beats before accelerating forward to the next recruitment. This happens ad nauseam until the story arrives at its sudden climax some two hours in, but instead of having the decency to end, it keeps going for nearly another twenty minutes, through an extended epilogue meant to tease the sequel. There’s a good movie hiding somewhere inside Rebel Moon – Part One. Snyder’s passion for this burdened battle-maiden saga shines through in every scene—he’s intent on presenting Boutella as both ripped and thoughtful—while the sci-fi setting is rife with tangible, weathered material awash in foggy atmosphere (Snyder doubles as cinematographer), and led by a visually exciting, multi-ethnic coalition of heroes teaming up to fight space Nazis. It’s a film that looks and feels alive, but beyond its first act, it’s completely dead on arrival, unfolding mechanically while maintaining only the barest appearance of Kurosawa’s classic and its handful Star Wars hallmarks. While it avoids Hollywood’s penchant for orientalism, and instead uses its designs to create an explicit anti-imperial and anti-colonial text, it fails to live up to both its eastern and western influences, and exists only as a mal-formed piece of marketing for something better.

"Dec 22, 2023"," Beginning with an epic musical score and grand voiceover before cutting to a vibrant alien sky, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon sets the tone for an eye-widening sci-fi adventure. Unfortunately, despite the director’s knack for spectacle, it soon transpires that this first instalment is a bland amalgamation of various other sci-fi flicks, with little in the way of personality or originality of its own. The plot follows a plucky farmer named Kora (Sofia Boutella) who flees her peaceful home after a tyrannical ruler’s ruthless soldiers demand all the village’s harvest. Her goal is to assemble a group of warriors strong enough to fight back against the invaders, and that’s about as far as the script goes in terms of its plot. Much of the film sees Kora and her growing band of companions zipping across various planets and getting into fights along the way. It’s essentially Seven Samurai in space, with elements of Dune and Star Wars sprinkled on top dragged across an over two-hour runtime. The protagonists’ journey takes them to a host of distinct and interesting locations that are home to some strange creatures. These inclusions give glimpses into a vast world full of intrigue, but there’s never enough time spent developing these ideas. One scene, for example, sees Jenna Malone play a half-human-half-spider creature who captures the children of settlers as revenge for what happened to her. Rather than explore this subplot to give the world some flavour, the script blasts past this encounter with another flashy action scene. This absence of worldbuilding likewise extends to the band of heroes. Whereas a large part of the charm and humanity of Kurosawa’s samurai classic came from the characters gradually forming bonds with each other, there’s rarely any interaction between Rebel Moon’s warriors. Most of what viewers need to know about them is told through some quick exposition before they vanish into the background. It doesn’t help that the actors feel like they’re going through the motions, delivering their lines lifelessly. The exception to this being Ed Skrein, who enjoys every second of playing the villainous admiral. Although its gorgeous panoramic shots and slick action scenes make Rebel Moon a good-looking film, its paper-thin plot and underdeveloped characters are what ultimately cause Zack Snyder’s space odyssey to fall disappointingly flat.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023"," A shallow imitation of Star Wars, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire indulges in all of Zack Snyder’s traits as a director, while only constructing the illusion of character and place. Had both been achieved, it would have made the film’s excellent visuals more than just a pretty screensaver. As a huge Star Wars fan, the prospect of Zack Snyder and Netflix‘s take on George Lucas’ critical work was fascinating. Star Wars itself is a mishmash of Lucas’ take on several genres and directors but produced a world that was still wholly original and filled with interesting themes, amazing characters, and analytical themes. So any work based on it brings expectations of similar quality. Well, watching Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire should quickly remove that notion. Lucasfilm’s rejection of Snyder’s idea for a Star Wars film however should have been the first warning that A Child of Fire would be nothing like its source material. Sure, A Child of Fire has an evil Empire, rebels, and takes inspiration from pop culture and the history of the world, but this is all surface-level. Poke at it, attempt to interrogate it further, and Rebel Moon reveals nothing of substance. But worse than this is that it applies Snyder’s trademark grime and self-seriousness that misses the point entirely. Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is an introduction to a whole new galaxy, where audiences find themselves on the farming planet Veldt, where the community works and lives harmoniously. One day, the evil Imperium shows up, demanding that the village sell its surplus grain for a seemingly fair price. This offer is refused by the village leader (Corey Stoll with a terrible beard), as before, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a relative newcomer, advised him that the Imperium wants everything. Things inevitably turn sour and the village leader gets his head bashed in by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who says he will be back in ten months for their next harvest, leaving a garrison behind to make sure this is accomplished.  A Child of Fire has the foundations for an intriguing galaxy, but it never goes beyond this. The film visits many places in which to recruit its many characters, but they’re no more than short vignettes that hint at how interesting a planet could be if more time was spent developing it. There are worlds with glorious cliffs, polluted mines, and even a world with a gladiatorial colosseum, but none of them feel like places, just planetary backdrops for the film to stick characters on for Kora to then whisk away on her quest.  With Snyder at the helm, it’s unsurprising his trademark style is present, except it’s dialed to 11. The atmosphere is thick with grime alongside an overbearing sense of self-seriousness, and the oppressive slow motion present in nearly every action beat drags it to a crawl. There’s also the over-sexualization of the characters. At the film’s start Kora is pressured to get with a village boy, and two action sequences happen to prevent rape. It’s an attempt at edginess, but it’s just crude. This hints at the fact that this was an R-rated film since there’s also an obvious lack of blood from action scenes — something has been held back for a Snyder Cut, an expected element to please the man’s fanboy cult. It’s this dark and grungey tone that strangles out a sense of happiness, a feeling conveyed by Kora herself in one of her exposition dumps. There is an attempt at the theme of found family (something that Star Wars is built upon) but the characters are too wrapped up in their own personal dramas to build upon this idea. Characters are also introduced and then quickly folded into the wider ensemble, preventing any meaningful connections from forming. Hopefully, this is something that can be improved upon in Rebel Moon: Part Two – The Scargiver. One of the more interesting parts of Star Wars, and sci-fi in general, is its ability to take parts of real-world history and current politics and use them to influence their worlds, to comment on society and history. Rebel Moon does this in a superficial sense, with its evil colonist empire inflicting its will on the galaxy. It’s also very much modeled on the Roman Empire, with the Senate, names of Admiral Atticus Noble and Regent Balisarius, and their overall attire. But this goes no deeper.  There is no clever criticism of Western Powers or comment on modern politics that might make the audience think about the situation around them and reflect on their world. Sci-fi doesn’t always have to be this, but the deeper imagery and themes it can inspire are absent, and this is disappointing for a film that wants to follow in the footsteps of Lucas’ work. Snyder certainly watched some Star Wars films — some of A Child of Fire’s locations are ripped right from Lucas’ galaxy — but overlooks their political purpose entirely. Kieran Burt joined Ready Steady Cut back in October 2022, bringing plenty of knowledge in various universes, including Star Wars, DC, and the MCU.

"Dec 22, 2023"," ""It's the beginning of something,"" a
character says in Rebel Moon: Part One  A Child of Fire, and that's a
boldly ludicrous statement to be coming after about two hours of movie. Yes,
co-writer/director Zack Snyder's wannabe epic of science-fiction prepares us for
the absence of much resolution with its announcement is this is only the first
half or so of a full story (The order in which the dual subtitles appear on
screen, by the way, almost makes us wonderand maybe worry, considering how
little actually happens in this entrythat this is only the first part of the
first half of the whole tale). That makes it quite the surprise, then, to
discover that the filmmaker barely gives us a setup by the end of this laborious
affair. The vague and cryptic tone with which the character loads that
""something"" makes one wonder if the screenwriters are even certain of
what's to come. That's also a surprise, considering how
simplistic and familiar the story's basic premise is. There's an authoritarian
empiresorry, imperiumwith a dress code that's reminiscent of Earthbound
military dictatorships of the 1940s and a massive ship, capable of ruining an
entire planet like some kind of death-dealing star. Against this might power
exists an alliance of rebels gathering resources and fighting back whenever they
can, and on a remote world, a farmer is about to come face-to-face with this
dark force and decide to join the fight. Thankfully, the movie doesn't exactly take
one-to-one inspiration from the films those descriptions suggest, although it's
probably a group of studio attorneys who are most grateful for that fact.
Snyder, along with co-screenwriters Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, wears his
inspirations on the movie's sleeves, pants legs, and pretty much any other
figurative section of clothing that could fit so many homages, if one's
generous, or rip-offs, if one isn't so much. One can find a bunch of other
influences of famous pieces of science-fiction over the decades, as well as
examples of fantasy and, since the movie that Snyder and company are primarily
falling back on was based on one samurai film, a plot that apes a different one
of those. What it lacks, obviously, is an identity to
call its own. Well, it also lacks interesting characters, storytelling that
seems to be going anywhere, and much visual polish, but all of those absences
feel like symptoms of that more significant issue. The plot follows Kora (Sofia Boutella), a
mysterious farmer on an isolated moon (Some early shots of her plowing fields
against the backdrop of a nearby ringed planet are fairly striking). She's a
relative newcomer to this community, and soon enough the villains arrive, demand
the entirety of the village's harvest, and kill their leader to prove they mean
business. Kora kills some occupying soldiers, sending her and Gunnar (Michiel
Huisman) to search for warriors who can defend the villagers when the baddies
return. Knowing audience members will rightly suspect
that the two are joined by five others by a certain point in the story. Once one
realizes the entirety of the plot here amounts to a recruiting expedition, it
really is just a matter of counting down until they reach that magic number. The
actual experience is about as rote, too. The recruits are Charlie Hunnam as a scoundrel
who appears to have a secret heart of gold, Djimon Hounsou as a disgraced rebel
general, Doona Bae as a meditative warrior who wields energy-emitting blades,
Staz Nair as a man capable of taming wild beasts, and Ray Fisher as a rebel
leader who can make rousing speeches. All of them get one or two scenes to show
off their skills, and we have to imagine the ones who make it through to the
end, as well as the others' replacements, will do more of those things in the
second installment. Even without seeing anything from the continuing/concluding
chapter, it's clear Snyder has decided to put most of the storytelling weight on
the sequel. That means Rebel Moon: Part One  A Child
of Fire just circles around the same pattern: the amassing group travels
from one planet to another, seeks out a new recruit, gets into some fight, and
starts the process over again. The locales are diverse in aesthetic, at least,
but they all share a grim and dimly lit appearance that does the variety little
favor. A lot of this looks murky, which is appropriate, considering the whole
movie exists in the shadows of otherand betterpieces of inspiration.

"Dec 22, 2023"," “American Fiction” is the directing debut of “Watchmen” series writer Cord Jefferson. In this adaptation of Percival Everett’s 2001 novel “Erasure,” Jeffrey Wright plays an uncompromising and frustrated novelist named Thelonious ‘Monk’ Ellison. The story follows Monk as he takes a forced “sabbatical” to care for his ailing mother (played by Leslie Uggams). When his latest book doesn’t sell, Monk writes, under a pseudonym, an offensive and exploitative tome that he’s sure will be lampooned. When the book is a runaway hit, the confused Monk must cope with his secret success while balancing the emotional crises in his life. Seeing where Monk’s grand charade takes him is funny and provocative, as publishers go crazy for the book and Hollywood comes calling. This pitch-perfect combination of dry, observant satire and relatable family drama elements is one of the most accessible end-of-the-year awards contenders. The performances are top-notch, with Jeffrey Wright a lock for an Oscar nomination. The attractive supporting cast features terrific work by Sterling K. Brown (who crushed it in the highly recommended “Biosphere” earlier this year). Director Michael Mann (see “Heat”) worked for 20 years to bring this passion project to the big screen. The film, a biopic about Enzo Ferrari, is a dull telling of events in the summer of 1957 when the Ferrari empire was in jeopardy. In “Ferrari,” Adam Driver plays the middle-aged Italian automobile entrepreneur. When his top spot in racing and high-end sports car manufacturing is threatened, Enzo pushes his team ever-harder to win. Meanwhile, the relationship with his tough-as-nails wife Laura (Penélope Cruz) is deteriorating, as details about his affair and child with Lina Lardi (Shailene Woodley) are revealed. While some viewers have noted the distracting computer-generated effects related to the showy automobile crashes, I found them shocking and exciting. But the drama and industrial intrigue came off as limp and unengaging. And the final race sequence seemed strangely detached from the rest of the narrative, as I struggled to understand how all of Enzo’s efforts on the racetrack managed to save his business kingdom. Performances are uneven, as Driver does his level best to look stern and maintain character with a sometimes-shifting Italian accent. Cruz gets the juiciest role and does the finest work in the film, while Woodley is miscast and never finds her character’s center. Cast: Fantasia Barrino, Taraji P. Henson, Danielle Brooks, Colman Domingo, Corey Hawkins, Phylicia Pearl Mpasi, Halle Bailey, Ciara, Gabriella Willson “H.E.R.,” David Alan Grier, Jon Batiste, and Louis Gossett, Jr. This handsomely made second cinematic adaptation of Alice Walker’s seminal novel struggles to justify its existence while also trying to separate itself from Steven Spielberg’s arguably perfect 1985 classic. The musical elements give this new production an added boost, but for those schooled in Spielberg’s film, it’s hard not to attribute the emotional feelings to nostalgia. The story focuses on Celie (played as a teen by Phylicia Pearl Mpasi and as an adult by “America Idol” winner Fantasia Barrino), who is forced to marry the cruel Mister (Colman Domingo). We see Celie grow up under Mister’s oppressive rule, which involves sending away her beloved sister, Nettie (played as a teen by Halle Bailey and as an adult by Ciara). Isolated and abused, Celie must cope with years of mistreatment until she is visited by singer Shug Avery (a terrific Taraji P. Henson). But this new friend might only make Mister’s cruelty worse. While Barrino is the lead, she is overshadowed by supporting performances. Danielle Brooks plays the straight-talking Sofia, a character previously played by Oprah Winfrey, who received an Oscar nomination in 1986. Part of Barrino’s problem is that the script requires her to be defeated until a critical turning point. But in the Spielberg film, Whoopi Goldberg conveyed more in her quiet and trembling calm than Barrino can muster. Of course, Barrino’s singing voice is strong and blends well with the rest of the spirited cast led by the showy and infectious Brooks, who, like Oprah, understands the demands of playing the tragic Sofia. But the musical theatricality, which involves fantasy sequences akin to the Broadway show upon which this is partially based, undercuts the gritty drama that undergirds Alice Walker’s mature source material. And where Spielberg’s film hit us hard with Celie’s despair and Sofia’s complete meltdown, director Blitz Bazawule plays things a bit too cheery. At well over 2 hours in length, the song and dance numbers weigh down narrative coherence. Cutting a few of these sequences, especially ones that don’t appear to have a plot purpose, could have made those that remain even more significant. But several numbers are stunning, like a scene when Shug arrives at the bayou honky-tonk aboard a boat and a fantasy sequence that has Celie belting while being surrounded by men on a chain gang. Wrestling fans might find “The Iron Claw” moving. But this abridged telling of the cursed Von Erich family isn’t the transcendent take on the sport it could have been. The story follows three brothers who became professional wrestlers in the 1980s. While the outcomes of their matches are all predetermined, the action in the ring is the product of careful training and athletic prowess. We meet the Von Erich patriarch Fritz (a very good Holt McCallany) as he moves from the ring to wrestling management. His goal is to make his beefy boys into stars, even if they have no desire to wrestle. The eldest, Kevin (a more muscled-up than normal Zac Efron), is tapped for greatness, but despite having the brawn, he struggles mentally to convey television charisma. David (Harris Dickinson) moves up in the ranks and is joined by former Olympic hopeful Kerry (“The Bear’s” Jeremy Allen White). The three men make a fierce and competitive presence, gaining notice from other leagues, who are always clamoring for talent. But the pressures to perform exact a horrible price, and the curse of the Von Erich family is their legacy instead of their achievements on the mat. This movie story casts aside steroid use, only showing it briefly, and ignores entirely one of the Von Erich brothers. Writer/director Sean Durkin’s dour handling of a notable, high-profile American tragedy fails to break through, even though performances (especially from a devoted Efron) are strong and the wrestling is sometimes exciting. But the problem is partially the sport itself. Professional wrestling isn’t a fake, sweaty activity; the competition isn’t related to who is ultimately declared the winner. Balancing the athletic elements with those related to raw showmanship proves tricky as Durkin’s script turns overly sentimental in the final act. The closing sequences almost seem to be lifted from an inspirational religious film. Lost is the irreverent, often hokey fun associated with the sport, as this vision depicts it as a desaturated damaging wasteland that leaves few unscathed. Where “The Iron Claw” could not figure out how to depict the sport of wrestling, “The Boys in the Boat” might have some viewers hitting the rowing machine. This wholesome and well-made adaptation of Daniel James Brown’s bestselling book is an excellent sports movie. The true story chronicles the efforts of the University of Washington’s rowing team to compete in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. In this Depression-era tale, Coach Al Ulbrickson (Joel Edgerton) assembles a team from open tryouts. Most members, including Joe Rantz (Callum Turner), have never rowed before. But Ulbrickson knows his sport and is committed to molding these young college students into Olympic-caliber athletes. The film has fun showing the process of training and early competitions. And Turner is good as Joe, a loner struggling to pay for school without parental support. Joe’s relationship with boat builder George Pocock (a great Peter Guinness) is the heart of the movie, as the two men are shown bonding while crafting and maintaining the tools necessary to make a run at the gold. Clooney’s conventional directing is just what is required because the story is so inspiring that no amount of tinkering is necessary. And the production design immerses viewers in the time and place. In one sequence, crowds watching a race are shown sitting in stands erected on open train cars that follow the boats along a river. “The Boys in the Boat” won’t likely compete for end-of-the-year prizes, but it’s one of the holiday season’s most pleasing movies suitable for audiences of all ages. Writer/director Andrew Haigh’s odd fantasy romance contains excellent performances from hot actors Paul Mescal and Andrew Scott. The movie has Scott playing Adam, a screenwriter living a lonely existence in an almost abandoned high-rise apartment building. When he begins a relationship with Harry (played by Mescal), the building’s only other resident, Adam explores memories of his parents, who tragically died when he was twelve. The movie’s illusory elements have Adam returning to his family home to discover his mother and father (played by Jamie Bell and Claire Foy) alive and well, as though they haven’t changed in over 30 years. As Adam spends time with his parents, he gets closer and closer to Harry. “All of Us Strangers” is a deliberate narrative that will frustrate some viewers who might consider it a languid horror movie and less a moving drama. “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire” is like the first draft of a juvenile “Star Wars” fan fiction tome. This comically bad science fiction adventure will remind viewers of other space opera misfires like 2012’s “John Carter” or the Wachowski’s 2015 epic “Jupiter Ascending.” The shame is that for all of director Zack Snyder’s undeniable talent in managing special effect-laden extravaganzas, he has trouble telling a wholly satisfying story. “Moon” started as a “Star Wars” universe pitch. And while there are elements that will remind you of George Lucas’ classic blockbuster, those homages are merely window dressing for a “Seven Samurai,” “The Magnificent Seven” knock-off. Low-budget producing and directing master Roger Corman set those stories effectively in outer space way back in 1980 with the pleasantly entertaining “Battle Beyond the Stars.” Unfortunately, none of Corman’s comic and campy sensibilities extend to Snyder’s take that plays things way too seriously. In “Moon,” former soldier Kora (Sofia Boutella) must assemble a ragtag group of fighters to repel an attack on a peaceful farming village on a distant fertile moon. The risky search brings her in contact with a range of dangerous rebels hunted by the evil ruling class and the disgusting Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, in a turn that approaches tongue in cheek but never quite gets there). Unfortunately, Snyder’s script, written with two other screenwriters, fails to understand the need to give each chosen warrior a distinct identity. And they come off as clumsy brutes with little understanding of sophisticated battle tactics. For example, one of their crew members is the revered, supposed genius General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), who demonstrates little military acumen. Kora’s hapless team doesn’t instill the slightest bit of confidence when challenged by the Admiral’s vast forces. It's too bad Snyder didn’t remember what worked for Luke Skywalker and his small but clever X-Wing pilots. To beat an overwhelming threat, you’ve got to outsmart them. “Rebel Moon” proves to be one dim bulb.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2023"," There's no denying that Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, which follows a pair of farmers as they seek aid from fighters to make a stand against the space imperials who would rob their village of its harvest, is derivative of other films. Beyond the fact that the film is an obvious Seven Samurai and Star Wars fusion, there's also the fact that Battle Beyond the Stars did the same thing more than 40 years ago. But does that really matter? And if it does, why can't it be a good thing? Like Sucker Punch more than a decade ago, A Child of Fire feels like a playground for story writer/director Zack Snyder to mix and match elements from things he loves in what can just as easily be called a celebration of influences as an uninspired pastiche. Like the multiple fantastical sequences in Sucker Punch, the many planets in A Child of Fire allow Snyder to freely play with varied and seemingly disparate aesthetics. Early on, sleek, dark metal, multiple rocket propelled landing ships of the villainous Motherworld land at protagonist Kora's (Sofia Boutella) adoptive home village that looks very much like the medieval Scandinavian inspired Rohan in Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings series. Later a flashback draws on a different city in Jackson's adaptation, the blue gray city of ruins Osgiliath, and fills it with bright red laser gunfire. Another sequence has the aid-seeking characters stop at a classic Western ranch, but instead of horses, the corral is home to a jet black griffin, or rather ""bennu,"" a creature that gives the film its greatest scene of true movie magic wonder when it takes a human character for a ride. There's also an entirely wooden city plucked out of any jidaigeki and a city evocative of the Blade Runner films where the farmers witness one of their recruits battle a humanoid spider monster played with relish by Jena Malone. The only worldbuilding problem with the Rebel Moon universe is one that applies to Star Wars as well: that the main players are all human. When Kora and her companion Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) begin their search for fighters, they visit a bar in the nearest city and as with the Mos Eisley Cantina in Star Wars, A Child of Fire takes the opportunity to show off a variety of creative alien designs. But in both, these imaginatively designed alien characters highlight that the core cast of these films are humans who don't require hours in makeup chairs or hours of post-production to render fantastical. As in Star Wars, those frustrations are forgivable, though, especially when the film delivers on the action that Snyder has become famous for, sometimes comically so. The fights are full of the slow-motion and speed-ramped combat Snyder perfected in 300. The sound for hand-to-hand blows are deafeningly heavy thumps whether the visual calls for level of sonic impact or not. Laser gunfire is even louder and farther down the low end while blade cuts offer some of the sharpest sounding slice sounds accompanied by blood soaring through the air. It's joyously over the top stuff in the best way. Similarly over the top, or at least overly on the nose, is the majority of the dialogue that brings to mind the ""I know writers who use subtext and they're all cowards"" joke. But it's all delivered with such sincerity, both from the very game A-list actors and from Snyder's framing of them as they speak, that it's impossible to be cynical about. Like the aesthetics Snyder's playing with, you can feel his adoration for the narratives he's pulling from and just how seriously he takes their themes of redemption and hope in the face of oppression. That adoration makes it clear that A Child of Fire is a movie from a filmmaker who loves movies and just wants to make movies for other people to love. And we certainly can't hold loving movies against him or the film.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," Rebel Moon bored the hell out of me. Bored, with a capital “B”. Zack Snyder has made a series of mediocre movies such as Sucker Punch and Army of the Dead. But his latest movie breaks a new record as he hits rock bottom with a so-called epic sci-fi adventure opera that seems like the next big thing. It was a cross between Star Wars and Seven Samurai, where he even originally pitched his idea to Lucasfilm as a standalone Star Wars movie not connected to the Skywalker saga. It didn’t work out as planned. Snyder went to Warner Bros. twice but got rejected before Netflix agreed to his idea and granted him the budget to film a two-part movie event, with the follow-up titled Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver slated for an April 2024 release date. But till then, the first part of Rebel Moon itself is already DOA. The story goes like this: Kora (Sofia Boutella) is a former Imperium soldier with a dark past who has since laid low on the farming planet of Veldt. Everything looks fine at first until the looming arrival of the Imperium ship above the sky. The soldiers led by the sadistic Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) demand all the farming village’s harvested grain and he will return in 10 weeks. To ensure the farmers were doing their jobs, he deployed a small group of soldiers to watch over them. Kora, on the other hand, chooses to leave the place before an incident revolving around an attempted rape of one of the villagers prompted her to kill the soldiers. Soon, with the help of fellow villager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), the two set out to assemble a ragtag group of warriors as they journey to multiple locations. This includes smuggler and pilot Kai (Charlie Hunnam), beast-tamer Tarak (Staz Nair), cyborg swordmaster Nemesis (Doona Bae), former Imperium general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) as well as warrior Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) and his sister, Devra (Cleopatra Coleman). Clocking at 134 minutes long, the movie overstays its welcome long before it reaches the end. Everything here screams clichéd as Snyder shamelessly borrowed and ripped off movies from Star Wars and Seven Samurai to Dune, The Lord of the Rings and even at one point, Inglourious Basterds. I don’t mind the lack of originality in a movie as long as it is entertaining enough to keep me invested throughout the running time. Too bad that’s barely the case for Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Snyder’s usual stylised slow motion is on full display but his penchant for employing that effect annoys me more than ever. The action sequences have none of the palpable thrills and high-stakes energy while the story, which Snyder also co-wrote alongside Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, is disappointingly bland from the get-go. There are no emotional and dramatic stakes as Snyder’s self-serious direction sucks the life out of the movie. It doesn’t help either when the protagonist played by the otherwise well-toned and physically fit Sofia Boutella is devoid of any personality. She is nothing more than a depressingly glum former warrior-turned-rebel trying to defend Veldt against the tyrannical Imperium army. It’s hard to care whether her character can make it throughout the journey since the movie strangely forgoes the importance of developing a strong character arc. The same also goes for the rest of the supporting characters, namely Charlie Hunnam’s cut-rate Han Solo-like Kai while Michiel Huisman disappoints with his feeble supporting turn as Gunnar. Then, there’s the scenery-chewing Ed Skrein, whose antagonist role of Admiral Atticus Noble is trying to ape Christoph Waltz’s Colonel Hans Landa-like role from Inglourious Basterds. The special effects are a mixed bag, even though the movie does feature some cool creature designs. There’s a brief but well-choreographed action set-piece between Nemesis’ lightsaber-like double swords against the humanoid spider-like alien Harmada played by Jena Malone. Anthony Hopkins, in the meantime, provides an above-average voiceover role as the sympathetic robot Jimmy. There has been news about the R-rated director’s cut of Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which reportedly contains nearly an additional hour’s worth of footage. Whether or not it would be a better version remains to be seen but for now, what we have here is a colossal misfire that I’m not sure it’s worth waiting for the second part next April.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," It’s time to accept that those “Release the Snyder Cut” t-shirts aren’t aging well. Because as Joseph Campbell taught us, the most important element in any “hero’s journey” is to pick a hero worth following. Writer-director Zack Snyder isn’t that hero. The clumsily-titled “Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire” is a sci-fi epic crippled by the limits of big budget sci-fi movie imagination. Whatever one thinks of  Mr. “300,” “Justice League” and “Watchmen,” his “Rebel Moon” is corporate content engineering at its most cynical. Campbell’s “Hero of a Thousand Faces” re-iterated the idea that there are only so many plots and basically only one heroine or hero to lead the reader, listener or viewer through them.  It’s a humorless mash-up of “A New Hope” and “The Seven Samurai” (and its Old West remake, “The Magnificent Seven”) a tale of imperialism and brutal repression, with lawless towns and saloons (cantinas), Brit-accented robots, shoot-outs, swordfights and rumors of a “chosen one.” The tech is just a re-jiggering and somewhat more art moderne “streamlined” redesign of all the “rebels” vs. “empire” futurism of every sci-fi movie of the past 50 years.  There are gladiators and bounty hunters and farmers in bib overalls and undisciplined goons as soldiers wearing recycled “American Gladiators” armor, insectoids and humanoid insects and hints of inter-species kink.  Supernaturalism? Fascism? Native mysticism? Fantastic Beasts and where to find them? Sure. They’re mixed-in with gigantic “planet killer” space Dreadnoughts and Ed Skrein as a pasty-faced sadist out to foil a rebellion.  The fights are filled with slo-mo, the cast peopled with generic characters played by actors with skills and just enough cachet to merit their paychecks.  The great Sir Anthony Hopkins voices an empathetic and utterly superfluous robot. Charlie Hunnam is an Irish-accented Han Solo substitute. Djimon Hounsou is a rebel general reduced to gladiatorial combat. And fangirl and fanboy favorite Sofia Boutella of recent installments of “The Mummy,” “Kingsmen” and “Star Trek” is Kora, a space war survivor laying low on a Nordic-accented moon named Veldt, just a farm gal in overalls and a Parisian pixie haircut, waiting for the moment when we learn she is “the most wanted fugitive in the known universe.” All that slo-mo as she fends off occupiers, imperial minions and treacherous locals of every stripe? It’s to minimize the incredubility of the fight choreography.  Kora’s village is visited by soldiers from The Realm who want their harvest. Don’t stop and ponder why this grain-“negotiation” would be carried out at an Eat Local level by a large, armed occupying force. It’ll give you a headache. A murder or two and one vengeful slaughter later, Kora and sweet-on-Kora farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) are off on a quest to find the Rebels, and get some help for their village. As for other help. Toshiro Mifune and Yul Brenner aren’t available. Maybe this general (Hounsou), this sword-slinging vixen Nemesis (Bae Doona), a freed-slave Tarak (Staz Nair) and can be enlisted. In flashbacks, Kora doles out bits and pieces of her past to Gunnar, and we see Cary Elwes as a bearded, uniformed heir to the Romanov crown, the powers of a possible “chosen one” “as prophesied,” and we never for an instant grasp anything resembling “what’s really at stake here.” All these petty crimes against originality wouldn’t matter a whit if Snyder & Co. mashed it all up into something fun or at least more distracting.  I’ve liked some of these actors in other roles. But even with Hunnam’s down’tha pub accident, there is nobody here I’d care to follow down the primrose path of this heroine’s journey, no well-handled action beat that isn’t literally recycled from a thousand other action films and a dozen other “Star Wars” outings. With comic book and “Star Wars” content tumbling into over-saturation and finally losing their cultural currency, the timing of this imitation “galaxy far away” is pretty bad, as well. But maybe “Part Two” of “Rebel Moon” will work better. If not, I’m sure some rocket scientist will start screaming for “The Snyder Cut” soon enough. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," Is Zack Snyder a villain or hero? Depending on which corners of the internet you lurk, the filmmaker who served as chief creative architect of the DC Extended Universe (which comes crashing down this holiday season with the lame-duck release of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom) is either the worst thing to happen to Hollywood since Joseph McCarthy or the saviour we’re all too Marvel-pacified to properly appreciate. The truth is of course far less incendiary, or interesting. Basically: the guy is a super-hack, bursting with ideas that are not his own, able to execute them with a façade of flair that evaporates once you look at any one image for longer than a super-slow-mo second. Does this make Snyder’s new Netflix epic Rebel Moon – sorry, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, which is being sold as one-half of the first film in a trilogy – an abomination? Hardly. This is instead inimitably watchable trash, the kind of high-gloss nothingness that doesn’t matter unless you really want it to. So highly imitative as to strip the word “derivative” of any meaning, Rebel Moon is fan-fiction writ large, as if Snyder believes he’s outsmarting everyone from George Lucas and George R.R. Martin to the estates of Frank Herbert and H.R. Giger. Perhaps there is a modicum of earned wit in how Snyder goes back to Lucas’s original Star Wars inspiration, Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, to patch together this story of an outer-planetary farming community that, when threatened by intergalactic colonizers who look an awful lot like space Nazis, enlist warriors from different corners of the universe to defend their homeland. But just because Snyder once pitched Rebel Moon to Lucasfilm as a dark Star Wars spinoff doesn’t make it the genuine article. And yet all the recycled elements are put forward with such deluded bravado by Snyder – and financed with such ridiculously bountiful Netflix resources – that you cannot help but resign yourself to sitting back and letting the guy get it out of his system. My, what a nice little facsimile of the Mos Eisley Cantina you’ve recreated here, Zack! Oh, how clever of you to pit the two actors who traded the role of warrior Daario Naharis on Game of Thrones against one another, with Michiel Huisman playing a brave farmer and Ed Skrein a bloodthirsty space-fascist. And, um, sure, good for you in getting Jena Malone to play a xenomorph-y alien spider who faces off against a lightsaber-wielding Wicked Witch of the West. The descriptions above might make things sound more intriguing than they actually are, but also consider that the charisma-free Sofia Boutella plays a farmland hero whose intensely complicated back story mixes Luke Skywalker with Guardians of the Galaxy’s Gamora. And that British actor Charlie Hunnam adopts the wildest Irish accent ever conceived to play a character who can only be described as “Han Solo, but also an IRA leprechaun?” Do you want to hear about how Anthony Hopkins voices a robot warrior-turned-pacifist named Jimmy? Possibly, but there are only so many hours in the day. Scratch that – there is apparently a black-hole’s worth of inverted time for all things Rebel Moon, given that Part One just barely assembles its heroic team by the two-hour mark. Only Snyder – or perhaps Lucas, James Cameron and Denis Villeneuve – knows what comes next in Part Two: The Scargiver. Or the “R-rated” extended (!) cut that is set to hit Netflix this spring. Bring it on, if you absolutely must. Just don’t expect audiences to champion a space opera they have seen so many times before. We will, however, definitely watch it with one eye (maybe even two) half-open.",POSITIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," Whatever the tonnage of the cash-laden trucks that Netflix presumably backed into Anthony Hopkins’ garage before parachuting him in to save the indefensibly dull Rebel Moon at the last moment, it wasn’t enough. The recent Oscar winner has seen it all in his day — he once played a Transformers historian, for Optimus Prime’s sake — but you’d be hard pressed to find a project in which he was as underutilised as he is in director Zack Snyder’s latest eye-sore. Hopkins is literally reduced to an exposition device, in a movie where one character greets another not with a customary ‘hello’, but with, “You’re the legendary assassin known only by the name of Nemesis. Assassinated 16 high ranking imperial officers and their security detail, all in a hunt to avenge your slaughtered children.” What? Even the film’s protagonist, a rebel warrior named Kora (Sofia Boutella), isn’t spared from having to deliver lines like this. In one of her first scenes, she tells her friend, “I am a child of war… the very idea of family was beaten out of me.” They literally live in the same house; did he not know? Snyder is hardly known for his writing — more than his usual visual ticks, the director’s biggest tell is probably getting one of his characters to say the words, ‘the why of’ — but Rebel Moon often feels like a first-draft. It’s uncommonly lousy, even by his standards. The filmmaker might cite respectable influences such as George Lucas and Akira Kurosawa, but you’ll never catch him admitting that Rebel Moon actually seems like it has been cobbled together from the rubble of his nemesis Joss Whedon’s short-lived television series, Firefly. Set in an alien universe ruled by a fascist regime — there’s frankly too much lore to keep track of — the movie opens on a peaceful planet named Veldt. This is where Kora has been living as a farmer for a couple of years, after having been discovered in the wreckage of a spaceship in the aftermath of a war. Unbeknownst to the imperial regime, the citizens of Veldt are living on some of the most fertile farmland in the entire universe. But their cover is blown one day, when a squadron of soldiers arrives unannounced, and demands the entirety of their produce. Ed Skrein plays the commandant, Atticus Noble, as a cross between Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds and Captain Russell from Lagaan. In his cruel demands, there are echoes of the Bengal famine, when British colonialists stole from India to feed their people and fund their war, leaving millions dead. Snyder makes the odd decision to portray Kora as a reluctant hero, but after having backed himself into a corner, decides that she cannot remain passive any longer. As expected, Kora turns on a dime and finds the motivation to fight back after witnessing villainy firsthand. It’s disappointing to note that even now — years after being pummeled for the gender politics in Sucker Punch — Snyder relies on violence against women as a narrative trope to propel his plots. In Rebel Moon, Kora kicks into gear only after watching one of her friends nearly get gang-raped by the Nazi cosplayers who serve as the film’s antagonists. Snyder also somehow finds a way to be homophobic in this faraway fantasy land — an impossible feat, you’d imagine, seeing as we’re talking about a world in which Jena Malone plays a humanoid spider-woman. But there you have it. The ugliness of Rebel Moon isn’t limited to its visuals. It’s probably worth pointing out that Kora doesn’t lead the fight against the imperialists herself, but chooses instead to put together a ragtag team of warriors. She is joined on her quest by her suitor, a man named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), and subsequently by a Han Solo-esque rogue named Kai, played by Charlie Hunnam with, who knows why, a Northern Irish accent. Rebel Moon’s origins as a Star Wars project are apparent. In addition to the shameless use of lightsabers and the Solo stand-in, Snyder also sends his protagonists to a cantina-style hive of scum and villainy, populated by skeevy characters whose faces seem to have been fashioned out of leftover prosthetics from his previous Netflix movie, Army of the Dead. It has been suggested — this is purely speculative, of course — that Netflix tried to reverse-engineer a Release the Snyder Cut-type movement for Rebel Moon. The version of the movie that has been presented to us was edited down from a more sprawling director’s cut, which will no doubt be released in some weeks. If this is true, it has to be the most comically inept decision made by a studio since, well, the Snyder Cut movement itself. Almost unbelievably, Rebel Moon might not be the best film about an armed conflict in a mythical kingdom this week. The FIDE Chess Candidates 2024 Round 14 is the final round of the intense three-week-long tournament. 17-year-old D Gukesh is leading by half a point, with three veterans close behind. Gukesh holds his fate in his hands as he faces Hikaru Nakamura, while Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana play against each other. For live coverage and updates follow our liveblog.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2023"," Jason Mamoa returns for possibly the last time as the aquatic DC superhero in “Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.” There’s over $200 million worth of eye candy in the story of our hero’s attempt to save the world from Black Manta and global warming….and about $5 worth of originality in the screenplay. It’s a merely adequate aquatic adventure. Emma Stone gives an Oscar caliber performance in the bizarre horror comedy, “Poor Things,” a feminist rethinking of the themes from Frankenstein. It’s bold, original. visually spectacular and very disturbing, with irreverent adult content that barely misses an NC-17 rating. For open-minded audiences, it’s a playfully nutty experience. “The Iron Claw” is one unique bird, an arthouse pro wrestling drama. Zac Efron leads the cast in the true story of the Von Erich clan, a family of grapplers who experienced more than their share of triumphs and tragedies. Its edgy tone may be grating to some viewers, but it’s surprisingly empathetic. File the animated comedy “Migration” under the ‘pleasant surprises’ category. The makers of the “Minions” movies offer a tale about a family of ducks that encounters many dangers when they decide to fly off to Jamaica. It’s a witty, imaginative and fast-moving family feature. Take a Star Wars movie, remove the sense of humor and adventurous fun, and you might have something that looks like the Netflix space opus, “Rebel Moon.” Zack Snyder’s dreary and derivative sci-fi flick is, sad to say, the first in a trilogy.

"Dec 22, 2023"," Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” immediately announces its presence as a giant mound of derivative fertilizer in the opening moments, when we hear the clichéd sounds of an Important Story Choir as an intergalactic dreadnought emerges from a Freudian-imagery portal and we get a voice-over telling us about the evil and oppressive Motherworld that is seeking to control the entire galaxy and kill all the rebels, that kind of thing.  Unless this is a parody of “Star Wars,” it looks like we’re in for a long and ponderous, CGI-dominated slog filled with stock characters, slow-mo battle sequences and interminable flashbacks designed to give clarity to a murky and convoluted story. Clocking in at an interminable 134 minutes, “Rebel Moon” devotes an entire movie to the Assemble-the-Team part of the story that usually takes about a half-hour in a typical action film, whether it’s a Western or a heist film or set in outer space. (“Rebel Moon — Part Two, the Scargiver” is set for release on April 19, 2024.) In an unsettling scene in which a group of soldiers attempt to gang-rape a local girl, a hero arises in the form of Sofia Boutella’s Kora, a newcomer to the village who as it turns out is a legendary warrior with a complicated past that she keeps having to explain in extended flashback sequences. After Kora wipes out a dozen or so soldiers, it’s on: She has no choice but to lead the rebellion against the Motherland. Time to draft a team of warriors! Charlie Hunnam is the Han Solo-esque mercenary starship pilot Kai; Djimon Hounsou is a hard-drinking gladiator who was once the great Gen. Titus; Staz Nair is Tara, a fierce and noble imprisoned warrior who gains his freedom by taming and riding a hilariously cheesy-looking giant griffin, and Doona Bae is the cyborg sword master Nemesis, whom we meet while she’s doing battle with an enormous spider-humanoid (poor Jena Malone!) who has kidnapped a child because she’s mad about her infertility, I kid you not. There’s also Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher as the sibling rebel leaders Devra and Darrian Bloodaxe, who sport such elaborate badass looks that it must take them like three hours every morning to do hair and makeup. All this recruiting takes us from one planet and outpost to another, most of them rendered in murky and unconvincing fashion. We feel we’re more in Green Screen Land than outer space. We’d be remiss not to mention the main villain in “Rebel Moon,” the psychopathic and sadistic Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who wears a uniform with distinct Third Reich influences and sports a haircut that indicates he might be a big fan of Jim Carrey’s look in “Dumb and Dumber.” What a drooling, creepy, evil weirdo.  “Rebel Moon” ends with the promise, or maybe it’s a threat, of a great and final battle to come.

Thus, this review comes from a place of disappointment as I search for a new sci-fi classic. If you’re sensitive to critiques of your faves, read no further.  I wanted to like it. I’ve been desperately chasing more sci-fi on screen. I want epic adventure from galaxies out there, somewhere (not to be confused with “Somewhere Out There”). Give me SPACE OPERA that moves the multitudes. However, when I left the theater after Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, I said a little prayer.  It went like this: Jesus, take the reel (the movie reel) or maybe the muses could send us a script doctor to heal this mess.  Rebel Moon Part One should be good. It has all the component parts: a seasoned director, a story based on the Seven Samurai plot engine (Akira Kurosawa, 1954), gorgeous production design, a charming and ‘really really ridiculously good-looking’ cast, and several million stacks in budget. Yet, somehow, what we end up with is a patchwork of sci-fi with no real impetus of its own. I’ll explain what I mean, the story starts on the planet Arrakis, I mean Tatooine, okay a world that looks like a desert but is abundantly fertile, despite its red-parched earth and rocky terrain. I’m not saying this isn’t possible but I am foreshadowing the lack of world-building that would usually give us a clue as to how this land yields abundant crops. The first thing I noticed—after the narrator (Anthony Hopkins) sets up a galaxy torn apart by war, betrayal, and a slain king—was the backdrops. They look like literal landscapes; painted and theatrical. Perhaps this is a love note to the golden age of Hollywood from director Zack Snyder, but it felt overdone and overly accentuated and I kept staring at them thinking: This would have worked nicely on Broadway.  The first person we meet is Kora (Sofia Boutella). She’s out in the fields alone, plowing the land with a horse-like creature that has a huge bony plate on its head. We can tell she’s strong, mentally and physically, wiry and battle-weary. We soon learn we’re in an old-world Scandinavian farming village and the work is hard but the life is good. There’s also a young blonde woman (Savanna Gann), who stands out and later becomes part of the inciting incident that fuels the coming quest. What sets everything off is the arrival of a battleship called The King’s Gaze. Kora nearly freezes in fear because she knows this ship means destruction. It’s from a planet called The Motherworld, an imperial collective led by the tyrant Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee)—the man Kora is running from—and his enforcer Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein). The leader of the village tries to bargain but things go sideways and Kora is forced to reveal her military training. She is lethal and that is good.  However, the village has 10 weeks until The King’s Gaze returns which means Kora is going to need an army of mercenaries to fight them off. With the help of Gunner (Michiel Huisman)—the guy who fumbled the bag in the first place—Kora aims to find The Bloodaxes (Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman) a sister-brother duo who leads the rebellion. But along the way she picks up a rag-tag squad of talented fighters, each with a grudge against the Motherworld (which we find out too late to matter). That’s where the Seven Samurai trope comes in. Much like Lone Wolf and Cub, the Seven Samurai story engine rarely fails, but Rebel Moon – Part One finds a way to flop around uselessly like a goldfish transported to Arrakis. Imagine Dune but for no reason, completely without purpose. We meet each character as though Snyder is a dealer/dungeon master and this is the hand of role-playing cards we’ve been dealt. Kai (Charlie Hunnam) the thief, Nemesis (Bae Doona) the sword master, Tarak (Staz Nair) the noble indigenous prince, Titus (Djimon Hounsou) the fallen general, and Hopkins as Jimmy the Droid—each member of the ‘Band’ gets an intro scene that highlights their special skill and ends with them stating their mantra. But, why did they say yes to protecting the village, what’s going on in their lives, what are their backstories? The movie barely gives you enough thread to string together its relentless stream of massive action set pieces. Rebel Moon plays out like a digital recording of its creators’ dreams, which is mostly a bunch of “You know what would be cool” moments.  For some of you that may not sound bad, but I need storytelling, world-building, and motivation to understand my heroes and to know why I should believe in them. If given a choice, I’d rather watch cut scenes from video games. They have better, more cohesive stories and I know the time I spend watching them will pay off. With Rebel Moon, I kept wondering how many levels I’d have to defeat before I could get the full backstory on a character. I still don’t know, I had a hard time defeating eye-rolls at the dialogue and boredom. If Rebel Moon – Part One had been made in the 80s I might’ve enjoyed it, but we’re way past that now. Or maybe we’re not that far away because you could create a Quiz Podcast out of all the references here: Seven Samurai, Krull, Clash of the Titans, Dune, Star Wars, Pitch Black 2, Gladiator, Harry Potter, John Carter, and many more. Seriously, this movie seems to rely on our knowledge of all the ‘Sci-Fi That Came Before’, as though we should be pulling from a hivemind compendium for context. What is the magic system? Shrug. Is it science-based? IDK. Who was the war with? Maybe the narrator/android said something at some point but I’ll insert another shrug here.  The best parts of this movie are: a betrayal you could only miss if you fell asleep but is still clever on the part of the betrayer; when a bunch of teeth get knocked out and go flying; and the quality of the hair styling and beard-grooming.  When asked my thoughts afterward, I said, “A pointless pile of sci-fi leftovers.” Maybe the fact Rebel Moon was pitched as a Star Wars movie but had to be flipped back to the original idea is what makes this movie such a pretty mess. I’m not sure. I do know I’m not mad, I’m disappointed.",NEGATIVE

When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival. The one positive Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire (Part Two will be on Netflix next April) going for it is that, even if the sci-fi journey plays like director Zack Snyder (also co-writing alongside Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad) pulling from a grab bag of clichés and tropes every five minutes, he is a visionary filmmaker with a general idea of how to weave in aesthetic elements of his entire filmography to provide a slight distinct flair to the familiarity. At times, the imagery feels like Star Wars colliding with Greek mythology, all with the expected unnecessary, nonstop slow motion during action sequences (that typically don’t add much aside from a rare moment where it allows for the filmmaker to home in on some facial emotions, presumably by accident.) The real frustration comes from not just how derivative the narrative is but the uninteresting, simultaneously boring but rushed execution that feels like watching someone play a series of video game mini-side quests rather than a full-on story of building a rebellion team where each member comes across as a fully fleshed out character with motives to understand and emotion to get involved in. Each recruitment sequence is shorter and sloppier than the last, and somehow more random, as if Zack Snyder is trying to shove any sci-fi staple he can think of into the movie (aliens, robots, humanoid spiders, lightsabers, spaceship battles, bounty hunters) without any consideration as to why it should be there or if it’s serving an entertaining or stimulating purpose. One minute, you’re watching a character bond with mystical animals (which feels blatantly plagiarized from Avatar), and then a South Korean swordswoman is taking down a child-murdering spider creature. As for the main plot, it is centered on Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former high-ranking member of Motherworld’s military regime, the Imperium, having escaped that life to hide out amongst a small band of villagers selling their harvest, sometimes to rebels. Kora has a tragic past, at one point working for the sadistic general that murdered her family and entire homeland, rising her way up the ranks to working closely with the King and his young daughter (a much kinder person with the potential to bring some peace back to this galaxy.) One day, a dreadnought appears, led by Admiral Atticus Noble (a shouting, ruthless villain played by Ed Skrein), demanding the harvest for the Motherworld. He tries to cut a one-sided deal where Kora, hiding her true identity with a completely new appearance, is aware that these people don’t stick to their word and will take whatever they want with force. Initially, Kora plots to run away and start anew, knowing full well that this land is about to be overtaken. This also wouldn’t be a Zack Snyder movie without some form of attempted sexual trauma, so Kora decides to stay and fight for the villagers once a group of soldiers (distractingly looking like they are wearing cheap knockoff Halo Spartan armor) threaten to rape a woman, which prompts the first fight sequence brimming with slow-motion and ground- sliding while firing guns. She then sets out on a journey slapped with uninteresting locations and set pieces to assemble the perfect team to defend the land. If anything, the periodic flashbacks to Kora’s time serving the Motherworld make for a more dramatic, thorny story that, unfortunately, isn’t explored much here. This is Part One, so that’s also pretty much all the film amounts to in terms of storytelling. There is some late-game betrayal, one or two revelations that don’t generate much interest in the sequel, and an inconsequential final action sequence. There are small bits of inspired character design and flourishes of excitement, but otherwise, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is a tedious stroll through anything and everything you have seen before done better in another sci-fi movie, with no emotional hook or any reason to care about what’s happening on screen. It is bursting with everything and nothing at the same time.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 21, 2023"," Kal-El help us, Zack Snyder believes in himself. Whatever one thinks of his dour, steroidal opuses — the rock-chord operas he pulls from splash panels or his own imagination — the director has the stubborn perseverance of a true artist. Did he give up on his vision when Warner Bros. essentially wrested Justice League away from him? No, he convinced the studio to release a mea culpa, less a director’s cut than a costly rebuke to the creative decisions of those who funded it. Not even the outright cancellation of a project is enough to stop him, apparently: Told that Lucasfilm would not, on second thought, be inviting him to play in its sandbox, Snyder reached for a shovel anyway. As its mouthful of a title reveals, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is not, technically speaking, a “Star Wars story.” But it was intended to be one: Snyder originally pitched it as “Seven Samurai with Jedis,” pulling into more explicit focus Akira Kurosawa’s influence on the franchise. Would that be in the patchwork spirit of George Lucas or merely redundant? Either way, Snyder’s off-brand realization of the idea defiantly broadcasts its IP origins with every droid, stormtrooper, and glowing fire sword never referred to as a lightsaber for copyright reasons. It’s a total mockbuster: Star Wars but cheaper and — given the man responsible — grimmer and grayer, too. At least Snyder resists the urge to scroll the opening exposition down the screen, opting instead for solemn voice-over narration, delivered under an ominous Junkie XL score that’s a far cry from the triumphant strains of John Williams. This galaxy far, far away is a feudal star system known as the Motherworld (not to be confused with Motherboxes), caught in the iron grip of an imperial government after the assassination of the king. Parsecs from the seat of power sits a quaint lunar colony, a land of simple but horny farmers introduced via a striking establishing shot that fills the horizon with the loom of a ringed planet. The image recalls both the Old West desert frontier of Tatooine and the paperback covers of sci-fi novels Lucas has probably read. Early into this Netflix time-suck, a warship touches down, depositing a squad of space Nazis — a Third Reich in regalia, haircut, and genocidal impulse. They’re led by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a smirking Gestapo with a real Richard Spencer look and punchability; if his name telegraphs a primitive irony (let’s just say you could not imagine him played by Gregory Peck), his falsely civil ramping up to murder is vintage Christoph Waltz. One of the more fascinating contradictions of Snyder’s work is the special delight he takes in obliterating fascist bullies, while also adopting a style of rather Riefenstahlian bombast. Commanded to prepare nearly its entire seasonal harvest for the Empire Imperium, the community instead ends up killing the rapist underlings left to supervise — the movie’s first set-piece of righteous, speed-ramped carnage, a Snyder specialty. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former royal guard laying low in the colony after going rogue, sets out with her casual farmboy lover (Michiel Huisman) to assemble a cavalry of reinforcements. Building the team is a reliably entertaining aspect of any Seven Samurai gloss, and there’s the superficial impression of fun in this episodic stretch, even as Snyder treats it as a license to cherry-pick images and ideas from a library of other blockbusters, including Avatar, Mad Max: Fury Road, Dune, and even Gladiator. Derivative can be okay. The problem with Rebel Moon is that it’s a pastiche leeched of joy, a Star Wars depressed by Snyder’s delusions of grandeur. There’s no range of personalities, no spunky innocent of the Luke variety, or sardonic rogue of the Han stock. Every one of the recruited warriors — an ensemble filled out by the overqualified, under-utilized likes of Doona Bae, Djimon Hounsou, Staz Nair, Ray Fisher, and more — is a Snyderian strong and silent type, an archetypal badass. Even the apparent Toshiro Mifune figure, a mercenary played by Charlie Hunnam, turns out to be less playful than he first appears. In Rebel Moon, the characters have much less dimension than the spare elements of world-building, like a parasitic puppeteer that shows up during the obligatory cantina pit stop or the spindly, robotic capture devices deployed by the bad guys. In both a micro and a macro sense, Rebel Moon moves like vinyl slowed by turntable debris. It takes an interminable 45 minutes at least even to set Boutella’s Furiosa-like fugitive on her way. Is the agonizingly deliberate pace a way to assure that this story will spill into multiple chapters, or is the bifurcation a byproduct of Snyder’s indulgent anti-efficiency, his apparent inability to do genre at traditional feature-length anymore? The man certainly loves to screech action to a crawl. At times, his famed ultra-slow-motion takes on the unmotivated quality of a video setting toggling on and off at random. Must we see villagers toss rice at the velocity of the Flash entering the speed force? Snyder thinks in tableau, perhaps especially since he started serving as his own director of photography. Like most of his work, Rebel Moon has moments of painterly beauty, indebted to the graphic novels he sometimes adapts and the art of ’70s rock albums he presumably spins while conceiving his projects. The One Perfect Shot crowd may well drink up some of the hero-pose, sprawling-alien-planet imagery, particularly on 70mm; Snyder gets a lot of mythic mileage out of placing his characters (including a melancholy, mechanical ronin voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who deserved more screen time) against brilliant vistas. Nearly every shot of the movie could probably function as an enticing Netflix thumbnail or a variant cover for the comic-book adaptation. But no emotional vibrancy or even variation lurks behind the visual grandiosity of this material. Rebel Moon only comes to life when the heroes are seized by wrath and killing in style; when one of them informs another that there’s “a difference between justice and revenge,” you have to wonder if Snyder knows or cares what that difference is. For all that he shaped the last decade of DC movies, he’s always seemed more like one of the Image Comics defectors — a first-rate illustrator and second-rate storyteller obsessed with edginess and rippling masculinity. Like a Rob Liefeld of the big screen, Snyder knows how to make characters look cool but maybe not how to imbue them with soul. And by splitting his newest epic in half, the filmmaker fails to even deliver on the promise of his original pitch; the movie just kind of stops instead of ending, demanding a few more months of Netflix subscription fees before we get to see the presumed defense of the colony, the Kurosawa-does-Rogue–One payoff. Rebel Moon, which comes with the promise of its own future #SynderCut (why not just deliver that from the start?), is already being billed as the beginning of a new multimedia franchise… which seems presumptuous, frankly. The film is proof that Snyder still has the drive to get his vision up on screen, Disney’s authorization be damned. But it also suggests that what’s really twinkling in his eye is another monument to his own cult of personality: a brand new SnyderVerse built atop the rubble of earlier, better science fiction. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is now playing in select theaters; it begins streaming on Netflix on Thursday, December 21. For more of A.A. Dowd’s writing, visit his Authory page. Director Zack Snyder had a banner year in 2021, with both a director's cut of Justice League on HBO Max and a Netflix original movie, Army of the Dead, being watched by millions of streaming viewers. And it looks like 2022 will be just as good for the prolific director as he puts together his next film for Netflix. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Snyder has cast Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Bae Doona, and Ray Fisher in a movie not based on preexisting IP called Rebel Moon. Rebel Moon is a sci-fi story that stars Sofia Boutella as a young woman living in a colony near the galactic rim. When a tyrant named Belisarius threatens to overrun the colony with his army, the young woman is dispatched to find warriors on other planets to return with her and defend her people. Essentially it's another remake of The Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven. The sci-fi genre owes much of its evolution to a myriad of television series that have shaped and redefined it over the years. These influential shows underscore the power of the small screen to captivate audiences, particularly through sci-fi's distinct combination of innovative storytelling and ambitious visuals. Whether viewers are fans of futuristic technology, extraterrestrial encounters, or dystopian futures, there's something for every kind of sci-fi lover among the genre's best entries. April was a bit of a low-key month for movies, but there was still plenty of pleasure to be had at the theater. Indies were well-represented with the surreal sci-fi movie The Beast while multiplexes enjoyed the social commentary and IMAX action set pieces of Alex Garland's appropriately divisive Civil War.

"Dec 21, 2023"," Rebel Moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them ""no."" When director Zack Snyder was presented with a blank check from one of the biggest streamers in the business and creative freedom, he released Rebel Moon, a film without an original moment in its body to the point that it would be funny if it didn't take itself so incredibly seriously. Director: Zack Snyder
Summary: When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival. Snyder lives the life many creatives would cut off a limb for. The partnership he appears to have with Netflix is the kind that directors spend entire careers hoping they might someday get a fraction of attaining. Someone is giving you whatever resources you need to make your vision a reality, and you don't need to force it into some recognizable IP. You're able to explore original worlds and concepts. It's hard to say how rare it is for someone to be in the position that Snyder is currently in regarding not only Rebel Moon but his Army of the Dead films as well. No one appears to be telling him ""no"" or reigning him in; he has access to anything, so what he has put on screen with Rebel Moon is everything because that's what it is. This film was made under the ideal circumstances for any filmmaker. This is why it is painfully ironic that Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire doesn't have an original bone in its body. When presented with the opportunity to do anything, Snyder decided that copying everyone else's homework in terms of storytelling, character beats, character arcs and even the look of the world was the way to go. There is not a single moment in this film that feels original or fresh. This isn't familiar places with a fresh coat of paint; this is just the same repurposed tropes with some slow motion and decent cinematography, and that's about it. You know these stories because you have seen them before; you know where all of this is going, and Snyder has given zero indication that he will be subverting anything in future installments because the tone of this could not be more serious. There is not a single moment of levity in this entire film, no joy, because, apparently, the only way to be dark is to be joyless. All of this is bad enough and would kneecap any film, but Rebel Moon also has to contend with the fact that it is half a movie and all of the challenges that come with that. When you are half a movie, you are, by design, working under a handicap because you have to make up for the fact that you're not giving your audience a satisfying ending. You have to make up for the fact that most of your film will be set up, worldbuilding, and exposition. You need to excel in everything else to make up for those facts, and Rebel Moon does none of that. It expects you to be fine with 85% worldbuilding, a long, drawn-out backstory, explanations of flashbacks, and gathering of the allies while doing nothing else of interest. As previously stated, nothing is new here; we have seen it all before, and now we see it with the added baggage of not even being a completed movie. Then, there is the issue surrounding the director's cut. Snyder has been nearly bragging that this director's cut will be very different from the first version of the film, as if that is somehow a good thing. This was not dictated by a studio that took a movie and cut it up so it didn't even resemble the original version [see Kingdom of Heaven]; this appears to be something that Snyder wanted to do the entire time. However, suppose this movie is everything, which it very much seems to be because everything is up on screen, and Snyder had the opportunity to do everything. Why is it, under those circumstances, he still couldn't find a consistent throughline for this film? Why are we staring down the barrel of four films [Rebel Moon 1, Rebel Moon 1 – Directors Cut, Rebel Moon 2, Rebel Moon 2 – Directors Cut]? Why was everyone making this film so unsure about where they wanted it to go that they had to make two versions and somehow think that it was something worth bragging about? Director's cuts are not a bad thing, but when that hour of footage changes things to the point that the director himself is saying, ""It's almost like a different movie. It's almost a different universe that [the R-rated cut] lives in than this movie,"" you're left wondering why no one could come up with a definitive direction for this movie that two were necessary. The impressive cast of this film is doing their best with what they are given, but it's hard to become invested in any of these characters when you can see where they are heading five minutes after meeting them. There are several major deaths at the end of the film, and a ""twist"" that was initially teased as a cliffhanger that you could have called five minutes after meeting the respective people involved. It's almost impressive how unoriginal all of this is, to the point that they somehow got an unoriginal-sounding score out of Tom Holkenborg. The best part of the film is the cinematography, but Snyder has always made pretty pretty-looking movies in terms of that, so it would be weird to expect anything less from him at this point. Rebel Moon is what happens when someone is handed unlimited money and complete creative freedom without having anyone around them who is willing to tell them ""no."" Snyder can make good films, but in the last decade, after the cult of fans began to surround him, it's clear he has started to believe the hype and ""do no wrong"" mentality. The only people who think two radically different cuts of the same film is a good idea are the creative way too in love with their own lore and a studio executive who sees it as the opportunity to release a movie twice. This is the foundation that Snyder and his team are building not only a second film on but a new cinematic universe, and much like his version of the DC Universe, it is a fundamentally broken foundation right out of the gate. This weekend, we are witnessing the end of the Snyder era of the DC Universe and how it all fell apart because of that broken foundation while also seeing history repeat itself all over again on Netflix. Unlike Justice League, there is no time to course correct Part Two of Rebel Moon, so this is what they have: a copy of a copy of every science fiction story and Seventh Samurai adaptation that we have seen and nothing more.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 21, 2023"," Rebel Moon begins on the Veldt, a bucolic paradise, where Kora (Sofia Boutella) has crash landed. The community adopts her as she tries to escape her troubled past—but the fascist Motherworld comes knocking when Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives and demands their harvest. To protect her new home from oppression, Kora must venture into space and assemble a crew to protect the simple farmers and take a stand.  Writer and director Zack Snyder made a name for himself for going big. Rebel Moon goes bigger and farther than any other Snyder project. The film was once pitched as a Star Wars movie and has many parallels to the original George Lucas saga. Where Lucas battled against a shoestring budget and limited special effects, Snyder had the resources to let his imagination run wild. Rebel Moon doesn’t reveal one or two planets. We visit a handful of places, each vastly different from the previous one. Each planet and town has diverse populations of humanoid and non-humanoid creatures. One planet being mined for its resources has a half-spider, half-woman decrying the pollution from over-industrialization. Another planet looks like a dust farm where they are training a Bennu (space griffin). There’s also a peaceful robot named Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) that may have turned to animism. The biggest flaw in the film is packing in too much. We already know there is a “part two” on the way, and the first film feels like a big setup for the next step. There isn’t enough time to get to know the characters or develop emotional attachments to them. As they assemble the team, they toss the new characters at you so quickly that you can’t appreciate their uniqueness. Every character, along with their outlandish names, could be their own main character. But why have one person harmed by the Motherworld when you can have a whole team of them? This is a space opera, and Snyder gives it the over-the-top production a space opera needs, with several scenes that subvert tropes in unexpected and hilarious ways. Snyder took the formula and went in a direction that may not make sense to most. It’s space—who’s to say what makes sense? Once again, Snyder proves he is masterful at creating stunning visuals. The film is beautiful to look at. He’s also brilliant at shooting a fight scene. They are always exciting and move like a choreographed dance. Rebel Moon puts the Snyder spin on a space epic and delivers a wild ride from start to finish. It’s not Shakespeare, but it sure is fun.",POSITIVE

"Dec 21, 2023",Simply registering the title of Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire takes more time than the film deserves.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 21, 2023"," It’s hard to know if Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire’s issues stem solely from its intentional truncation. How much blame can fall on director Zack Snyder, America’s sweetheart, and the embattled visionary behind The Snyder Cut (among other films, too, if you can believe it)? Long before Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire hit theaters prior to its streaming release on Netflix, it was obvious to those in the know that the film we were going to get was not the real film. Or, it was, but edited down by about 50% and then, seemingly, a little bit more, with scenes skipping merrily along from point A to B with no clear path which connects them; a two-hour-and-13-minute film that feels like five minutes, in a bad way. Characters appear and barely speak (Djimon Hounsou is maybe done the dirtiest in this respect), relationships are forged with little foundation and, somewhere along the way, we’re all meant to not only care about what we just watched, but care enough to watch a second film. It’s difficult to even fault this most pressing issue, when the film that you just watched is both obviously a hack job and explicitly, intentionally made for the sole purpose of Snyder Cut 2.0: The Rebel Moon—Part One director’s cut, Snyder’s actual, intended film, will be released, allegedly, sometime next summer. As explained by Snyder himself, the director’s cut, which will be rated R, is “almost like a different movie”—well, because, it probably is a different movie, based on what I and everyone else has already watched. As of right now, Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire is less a movie and more a collage of barely-connected scenes. According to Snyder, it was Netflix’s idea to release the movie in two cuts, something he admits he had never experienced before as a director usually compelled to release his own cut after the demand for it presented itself over time. He further explains that Netflix’s reasoning had to do with the scale and cost not being “responsible” with an R rating, which just doesn’t make sense at all when the film wasn’t produced with a meaningful theatrical release in mind; the rating of the film shouldn’t actually matter if it’s just going to streaming. At any rate, here is what Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire is about, for now. In a universe referred to as the Motherworld, Kora (Sofia Boutella) lives on the prosperous farming planet of Veldt, led by Corey Stoll wearing a fake beard doing a weird European accent, and his horny wife. On Veldt, Kora moves rocks, broods, speaks in platitudes and spurns the affections of handsome, good-hearted farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman). Kora was rescued and brought to live there many years ago, after working for and living with the Imperium. The Imperium are a bloodthirsty entity which hops from planet to planet forcing the inhabitants into subjugation, and whose armed forces had slaughtered Kora’s own family when she was a child. But the Imperium finally makes its way to peaceful Veldt, where Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), the ruler’s right-hand man, carries out a brutal execution and announces his plans to overtake the community. After a bloody altercation, Kora and Gunnar break from Veldt and the Imperium’s presence on a mission to, one might say, “assemble a team” in order to take on the bad guys. It’s weird. While watching Rebel Moon, scenes happen, characters are introduced and speak to one another, things move along. The narrative and visual rhythm are undeniably off, but I can understand what’s happening and why. In the moment, nothing feels terribly egregious. But when you step back, everything suddenly becomes amplified, and you see that Rebel Moon is held together with spit and glitter glue and pipe-cleaners. By the time the credits rolled, I realized I don’t think I’d ever watched a movie this long that still felt so brief and bewilderingly abridged; where so much happened and yet nothing happened at all.  Individually, scenes are often enjoyable enough, like the Star Wars Cantina rip-off scene, or the Harry Potter hippogriff rip-off scene, or the Jena Malone spider humanoid scene—the latter of which might be the best in the whole film. Malone plays Harmada, a grotesque arthropod monster whose home in a mining village was colonized to the extent that she now struggles to bear children. Like Harmada, there are other moments of unpleasant body horror; a patron at the Not Cantina who relays info to Kora and Gunnar is a netherworldly creature with tentacles affixed to a man’s body, using him like a puppet to speak. But as to be expected in a PG-13 movie meant for an R rating, it’s all missing something more. It’s annoying to know that we’re going to get it, and that it’s been withheld from us for nonsensical reasons. There’s a story here, but all we have right now is a corkboard covered in photos tacked on with pins and connected by a series of strings. And yet, is the story that Snyder gave us going to be any better with nearly two more hours appended? Rebel Moon—which the director began cooking up when he was a child—was explicitly intended as a Star Wars project, before his pitch to Lucasfilm went bust and Snyder was forced to go back to the drawing board…and it feels it. Like George Lucas, Snyder took inspiration from Akira Kurosawa. There’s a chosen, orphaned warrior destined to save the galaxy, a snarky pilot they need to help them, a fascist movement seeking galactic domination: What does the “Imperium” sound similar to?  Yet it’s all missing the juice of the Star Wars universe—not terribly surprising, even as a part-time Snyder apologist myself. Acting as his own cinematographer (as he did for Army of the Dead), Snyder’s scenery is as dour and neutral-toned as ever, alternating between gorgeous setpieces like the Harmada sequence and a truly overbearing lack of imagination or visual flair for a movie that’s billed as a space opera. The action and violence, Snyder’s notorious wheelhouse, are full of his usual trademarks but boring to look at and poorly paced. And on top of the iffy visuals and even iffier story, every character seems woefully miscast, aside from Skrein’s Cosmic Hitler Youth. Boutella excels in fight scenes and she can be an incisive presence, but she doesn’t have the charm to be what is essentially a female Luke Skywalker. Her lines fall flat, spoken like she wants to will gravity into them. In her defense, they were written flatly. And who the hell gave her that fuck-ass bob in space? Towards the end of Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire, after the epic battle has been fought and won, Hounsou’s character delivers the perfect victory monologue and says that their situation feels like it’s “the beginning of something.” He might as well have turned to the camera and said, “Stay tuned for Rebel Moon—Part 2: The Scargiver, streaming on April 19.” I admire Zack Snyder, partly because he’s a difficult guy to dislike and primarily because he’s ambitious, confident and singular in his artistic vision, even when it doesn’t always work for me (and for many, many other people). I’m a huge fan of Watchmen, I really enjoy Army of the Dead and 300, and all his DCEU installments make me want to kill myself (but his Nick Cave needledrops in Zack Snyder’s Justice League are legendary). Artists are more interesting when they’re divisive, and some might say Snyder’s career has become defined by that word. Whether or not the extended version of Rebel Moon is much of an improvement on the initial version, I’ll always be eager to see what kind of division Snyder’s cooked up next—it’s just disappointing to see his work cheapened by Netflix meddling. It’s clear that the savvy geniuses over at Netflix Incorporated were eager to cash in on the frenzy of the Snyder Cut phenomenon by manufacturing their own in Snyder’s epic space opera. Of course, as other studios will likely realize once they try to artificially replicate the success of “Barbenehimer”—which we all know they absolutely will—corporations cannot replicate the organic fan momentum of grassroots social media movements like “Barbenheimer” or “Release the Snyder Cut” (no matter how toxic the latter has proven to be). There’s no zealous demand for “Release the Snyder Cut: Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire” and not just because the title is far too many words. We all know that it’s already coming. It’s cheap. It’s being handed to us willingly. It wasn’t won after a hard-fought battle. It wasn’t made by the people, for the people—it was made by Ted Sarandos, and who the hell wants that?

"Dec 21, 2023"," El polémico director Zack Snyder está de regreso, en esta ocasión con la primera parte de Rebel Moon: “La niña del fuego”. En esta nueva obra original del cineasta, conoceremos la historia de Kora (Sofia Boutella), una joven y audaz guerrera, quien, después de que su pueblo es atacado por un ejército tirano, en busca de conquistar sus tierras, se enfocará en reunir a una plantilla de guerreros forajidos para hacerle frente al inesperado altercado. No es ningún secreto el empeño y dedicación que Snyder pone a cada una de sus producciones. Es evidente el amor que el realizador siente por su trabajo y el respeto que tiene por cada integrante de su equipo. No por nada, sus actores siempre se muestran felices y agradecidos con él, y constantemente es algo que expresan en entrevistas y conferencias de prensa. Por desgracia, nada de esto resulta suficiente para que Rebel Moon se convierta en una extraordinaria cinta de ciencia ficción. Esto, pese a que sí cuenta con algunos momentos memorables. Podríamos decir que Rebel Moon es todo lo que se esperaría de un filme de Zack Snyder… tanto para bien, como para mal. Empecemos abordando el lado amable de la cinta. Y es que, lo que es más digno de aplaudir aquí, es la tremenda calidad visual que maneja el largometraje. Es muy probable que “La niña del fuego” obtendrá múltiples nominaciones, en diversas ceremonias de premios, por sus grandiosos efectos generados por computadora. Su fantástico CGI nos permite ser parte de un hermoso espectáculo inmersivo, que deleita a la pupila y nos transporta directo al campo de batalla. Por instantes, se siente como si nos adentráramos a un videojuego de acción, en primera persona. A su vez, el diseño sonoro también destaca de sobremanera, ya que da apertura a una experiencia sensorial. Logra envolver en su totalidad al espectador, y lo vuelve partícipe del conflicto bélico. Asimismo, el score, a cargo de Tom Holkenborg (quien ya ha trabajado con anterioridad al lado de Snyder) da pie a la creación de un ambiente épico, cuyos matices heroicos despiertan una constante sensación de valentía e intrepidez. Es una tristeza que la película no vaya a tener exhibición en cines, para poder apreciar al máximo su grandeza audiovisual. El desarrollo de los personajes es plano y escaso (por no decir nulo). Mientras que conocemos información sobre el pasado de nuestra protagonista, Kora, todo se aborda de forma superficial, a modo de flashbacks, en pocos minutos. Debido a ello, no nos terminan por quedar claras sus motivaciones, más allá de su deseo por salvar y vengar a su gente. De esta manera, resulta predecible el trato que sufren el resto de los personajes. Todos lucen atuendos vistosos, tienen personalidades muy contrastantes y poseen habilidades diferentes, cualidades que dan como resultado a un equipo de guerreros bastante llamativo. Sin embargo, poco nos interesa lo que suceda con ellos, ya que el largometraje no se preocupa, en lo absoluto, en darnos un trasfondo sobre cada uno de los personajes. Sólo se nos dan migajas de información, por lo cual, es imposible conectar y empatizar con ellos. Por otro lado, el tan característico uso excesivo de la cámara lenta, por parte de Snyder, por supuesto que está de regreso. Si bien las diversas tomas en slow motion nos brindan la oportunidad de apreciar a detalle el bello diseño de vestuario y producción, la repetición tan continua de este recurso termina por generar cierto hartazgo. Escenas que buscan ser épicas, caen en un melodramatismo que raya incluso en lo ridículo y risible. La cinta se toma demasiado en serio a sí misma, y esto puede resultar en algo pretencioso, que saca de sintonía al espectador. Rebel Moon: La niña del fuego cumple su propósito principal como filme de acción. Nos proporciona una buena dosis de secuencias explosivas, para disfrutar con una cubeta de palomitas, y logra entretener al público por más de dos horas. No obstante, el desarrollo y el desenvolvimiento que tiene la historia deja mucho que desear. Es difícil que la situación pueda mejorar para la secuela, pues las bases ya han sido planteadas. Esta película, sin duda, será una que los fans de Zack Snyder amarán y defenderán, mientras que al resto de los espectadores muy probablemente los dejará con un sabor de boca agridulce.

"Dec 21, 2023"," Once a discarded pitch for a Star War, now even before it’s released an already-truncated first half of an eventually-six-hour techno-fantasy epic, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: Child of Fire offers its creator a massive canvas, almost unlimited resources, and promises the primary influence of no less than Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. And yet, it’s the worst-case scenario of that potential: a hopelessly derivative, technically awkward, clumsily expository half of a movie. So, apparently, there was a fascist galactic empire that lasted for thousands of years, razing and pillaging world after world and subjugating their peoples. But then one day some even worse fascists staged a coup, took over, and blamed the whole thing on insurgents who had already been fighting the first set of marginally nicer fascists. Now, those bad guys — The Motherworld — have come to the peaceful farming world of Veldt, like the bandits in Seven Samurai, to steal the grain from this one village. And so, it falls to Kora (Sofia Boutella) to seek out warriors from around the galaxy to help the farmers make a stand against the evil Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) and his troops. What follows is scene after scene of endless plot and character exposition, as our heroine and her cadre of cohorts hop from planet to planet gathering help. There’s rogue-ish Kai (Charlie Hunnam), slave Tarak (Staz Nair), miserable swordswoman Nemesis (Bae Doona), and so on and so forth. It’s at roughly the halfway point that viewers will start to wonder if Djimon Honsou is going to show up as a grizzled warrior (don’t worry, he does). Each one of these players is granted a lengthy showcase scene, like taming a wild giant bird or fighting a deadly spider-lady with what were at some point in this film’s life probably lightsabers. Between character introductions, Kora gives one speech after another delineating her backstory; at one point she even says, “I’m telling you this so you know who I am,” which it’s tough to imagine isn’t an intentional joke. Sadly, it isn’t. Throughout all of this explication of character Snyder insists on the idea that they’re all escaping from some central trauma — something he clearly believes in full is the ultimate project here — but it’s all treated with such blunt obviousness that you can guess the stories before they’re even told. One longs for a story that allows its archetypes to tell their stories through action — being who they are rather than explaining it. The worlds these characters inhabit are also woefully under-imagined; over here is a familiar desert world, over there is another dank evil empire spaceship populated by bad guys with vaguely British accents, and then there’s yet another industrial dystopia. One world is even just a green-screened backdrop of blue clouds. There is admittedly some cool creature design — the aforementioned spider-lady (played by Jena Malone), a squid-faced regent, a little bug parasite that sucks its victims’ brains out while it puppeteers them — but most of our lead characters are blandly human. It’s enough to wonder why the sword-wielding badass couldn’t at least have four arms or something. At least all this plot is welcomely broken up by Snyder’s action, punctuated by his trademark speed-ramped tableaux. There’s a remarkable clarity to it as always, and he’s working as his own DP here — as he did in the equally misbegotten Army of the Dead, but here with much less handheld — and he offers his cast the chance to finally shut their mouths and get to work doing what they were hired for: to look awesome posing. It’s clear that the violence, and therefore the cutting, has been defanged to get a lighter rating, but there’s still a frankness to the bloodshed that is too often missing from stuff like this. That said, it’s unclear that another hour of story will be worth slogging through to get some extra action. Rebel Moon is clearly full of enthusiasm and fueled by earnestness, but Snyder is totally lost in the weeds, especially regarding the needless promise of so, so much more of what already doesn’t work here. For all his sincerity, he’s poured his heart into something that’s just… air meat. DIRECTOR: Zack Snyder;  CAST: Sofia Boutella, Djimon Hounsou, Ray Fisher, Bae Doo-na, Ed Skrein;  DISTRIBUTOR: Netflix;  IN THEATERS: December 15;  STREAMING: December 21;  RUNTIME: 2 hr. 15 min.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 21, 2023"," His newest project, a collaboration with the streaming service, Netflix, had been germinating in his brain for a decade before he was able to film it.  Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, had a limited theatrical release last week before making its way to Netflix just in time for the holiday weekend. Years after the King (Cary Elwes; The Princess Bride) and his niece, Princess Issa (Charlotte Maggi; Summer Love) were murdered, The Motherworld is ruled by a dictator, Balisarius (Far Fee; Hawkeye), who has created a seemingly unstoppable empire.  Meanwhile, living a peaceful life as a farmer on a planet called Veldt is Kora (Sofia Boutella; Atomic Blonde), a former high-ranking Imperium soldier who looks to bring together an army of rebels to fight Balisarius' henchmen when they threaten the people of Veldt. Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is unquestionably Snyder, with his slow-motion sequences and action-driven plot.  He also draws out some scenes to the point of ad nauseam but one can't expect anything less from a director who made a four-hour film for Warner Bros.  However, within the 133-minute runtime, there are some excellent scenes while there are also some that miss the mark.  For example, when Balisarius interrogates Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein; Deadpool) after he loses a battle to Kora and the Rebels, the dialogue could have been truncated to the same outcome. Boutella is no stranger to stunt fighting having portrayed strong yet villainous women in previous roles.  She adds a layer to her strong performance by not only showing off her action skills but by also offering a sense of humanity and heart to a hardened and fierce warrior.  She is matched in her intensity by Skrein and the two offer one of the better battle scenes in the film.  Charlie Hunnam (Sons of Anarchy), Michiel Huisman (Game of Thrones), and Djimon Hounsou (Guardians of the Galaxy) all do a fine job providing emotional moments for Boutella to feed off of. The rest of the cast is hit or miss with some fine performances intertwined with mediocre ones. Where Snyder is really at fault is in the pacing of Rebel Moon.  While it should be a cohesive story, it instead reads like a television show with each subplot having a clear beginning and ending in which to interlace some commercials.  It makes for a choppy feeling overall that takes the viewer in and out of scenes, which is very distracting. The CGI is also awful, looking amateurish and as if it were produced on older equipment. Conversely, the fight scenes are impressive and well-choreographed.  For example, when Nemesis (Bae Doona; Cloud Atlas) fights the spider creature, their entanglements seem like tango as they dance around the room. There are also some interesting weapons including Nemesis' swords that can be set on fire to increase the damage they can inflict on an enemy. Rebel Moon, drawing inspiration from anime and Star Wars, was initially pitched as a Star Wars film in the 2010s to Disney. However, its disjointed plot segments hinder smooth scene transitions, falling short of its influences.  Unfortunately, Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire isn't going to translate into a triumphant return to film for Snyder and doesn't remotely resemble his earlier creations like The 300 and Man of Steel. Hopefully either the R-rated director of cut or Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver will clarify the story more.

"Dec 21, 2023"," Oddly, for a movie that’s rated PG-13 and often plays like a young-adult fantasy, Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” features at least two attempted sexual assaults and a queasily erotic encounter between a shirtless man and a many-tentacled alien. The film’s most thorough violation, though, is of its cinematic bloodline: To call “Rebel Moon” a “Star Wars” pastiche — with a dash of “Dune,” a lick of “Lord of the Rings” and a whole heap of “Seven Samurai”— is both glaringly accurate and somewhat redundant. In today’s fantasy-verse, derivativeness is virtually a given. Snyder has long been open about his influences, and has been imagining this crossbreeding of mythologies since he was in college. Somewhere in a distant galaxy (you know how far away) floats a peaceful planet called Veldt where burlap-clad villagers till the soil and mind their own business. A fascistic empire known as the Motherworld has other ideas, sending its representative, Admiral Atticus Noble (a scenery-scarfing Ed Skrein), to demand grain for its army. Brazenly channeling Ralph Fiennes’ character from “Schindler’s List” (1993), Atticus sports bowl-cut bangs, an S.S.-style uniform and a really big stick; so after he promises to return and slaughter the villagers if grain is not forthcoming, finding a savior is on top of everyone’s to-do list. Enter Kora (Sofia Boutella) a mysterious outsider with a secret past, an ultraflexible spine and an expression that splits the difference between ticked-off and smoldering. Kora has her own reasons to seek revenge on the Motherworld; accordingly, accompanied by the gentle Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a confrontation-averse villager who looks at Kora the way your dog eyes your dinner plate, she embarks on a planet-hopping quest to round up fellow rebels. Essentially a getting-the-gang-together movie, “Rebel Moon — Part One” (the conclusion, one hopes, follows next April) allows each insurgent a showy set piece and a line or two of grudge-filled back story. Among these is Charlie Hunnam as the rascally Kai, a Han Solo stand-in and the sole cast member with a jot of personality; Bae Doona as a master swordswoman with lightsaber forearms; and Staz Nair as a hunky creature whisperer. The movie’s most fun and flawless performance, though, comes from Jena Malone as a monstrous spider-woman who kidnaps small children. Her design cribs shamelessly from a “Doctor Who” character, but Malone gives her an Alice Krige-as-the-Borg Queen energy that’s creepily effective. Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Dec 21, 2023"," Zack Snyder's ""Rebel Moon"" is a cornball space adventure that's like ""Star Wars,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and a few dozen other signposts — a little bit of ""Star Trek,"" a dash of ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" a hint of ""Starship Troopers"" — all rolled into one. To its credit, it borrows from a solid slate of sources, and while it's highly derivative, it's also highly watchable. Its referential nature helps it clip along at an expedient pace, and while it never feels like you're watching something new, it at least feels like you're watching something familiar. ""Rebel Moon"" is like coming home. In the movie — its full cumbersome title is ""Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire,"" and yes, a Pt. II is due out in April — a peaceful group of farmers on a far off moon known as Veldt is raided by an evil group of space Nazis known as the Motherworld. Its commander, Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, appropriately dastardly, like if ""Inglourious Basterds'"" Col. Hans Landa was played by Cillian Murphy) wants the planet's crops and puts everyone on notice: He'll be back in 10 weeks, and he expects a full bounty. Clock is ticking. Kora (Sofia Boutella), an ex-Motherworld soldier, leads a resistance against the tyranny, and along with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a Veldt farmer, she cruises around the galaxy to gather up a team to take a stand against the bad guys. This is where ""Rebel Moon"" picks up steam as the pair visits planets with names like Daggus and Moon of Pollux, the latter of which sounds like an '80s goth band, in side missions that feel like tiny episodes inside the larger whole. It moves so quickly that at one point Snyder stages an elaborate fight between a swordsmith (Doona Bae) and a spider-lady (Jena Malone) whom we've barely even met. Wait, who are these two again? But the point is ""Rebel Moon"" moves, and its stakes are always clear. Charlie Hunnam plays a mercenary who joins the squad, same with Staz Nair, who plays an imprisoned blacksmith who tames a giant beastly blackbird creature in the film's most purely entertaining sequence. Djimon Hounsou plays a warrior the crew picks up along the way, while Sir Anthony Hopkins voices a C-3PO like robot who stays back on Veldt while the gang visits different planets. (He probably should have tagged along on the journey, they could have used his banter.) Snyder shoots in heroic low angles, pulling from his own ""300"" playbook, while also either nodding to or ribbing J.J. Abrams — it's unclear which — by employing an overabundance of lens flares. We know where ""Rebel Moon"" is headed, and there aren't many surprises along the way. But it's never dull, and this dubstep space opera knows when to drop the beat.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2023"," It’s not Zack Snyder’s original—I use that term sarcastically—Rebel Moon: Part One: A Child of Fire is too long and leaves the story with no real closure or ending, which you should always keep in mind for the audience. The script offers minimal character in terms of development despite endless exposition minutes going nowhere. For all its epic scope and world-building, Rebel Moon is a vain and hollow attempt at a love child “throupling” of grandeur adventure films such as Star Wars, The Matrix, and the Indiana Jones franchise that tests your patience immediately after the first act. Not to mention abandoning an exciting theme of artificial intelligence. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire‘s story follows Kora (Sofia Boutella), a beautiful farmhand with a secret. Kora lives peacefully on the independent planet of Veidt with her inner circle, a father figure in Hagen (A White Day’s Ingvar Sigurdsson), and love interest Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), the community’s expert agriculturalist. Well, Kora’s past is about to catch up to her. On the day of the harvest on Veidt, a planet with rich soil, the notorious Imperium forces visit. Led by the evil Atticus Noble (Midway’s Ed Skrein), they take over the earth, forcing the residents to work and giving them their only food supply, which means they will starve. Kora is about to leave when the new soldiers attack a young girl, and she decides to take matters into her own hands. In a way, you may wonder if Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is some cinematic version of The Milgram Experiment or, in a more entertaining vein, Community’s The Duncan Principle, pondering how much painstaking neon-colored boredom one can take. The first act has some juice, with Boutella developing an exciting action character that matches Snyder’s fast-start, slow-stop fight scenes. Then, the second act begins, most of the mystery dissolves, and endless exposition becomes the name of the game for the last 90 minutes. Your standard clichés spend an hour recruiting characters to bring back to Veidt, but the scenes are overly long. Each character is explored in a backstory that’s grating. These are usually scenes done in a quick montage within a few minutes. From Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus, Staz Nair’s “Fabio-light” animal whispering Tarak, and Doona Bae’s annoyingly empathetic cyborg swordmaster Nemesis, these are all cardboard cutout action film characters you’ve seen before. And when Rebel Moon finds something interesting, Kai’s (Charlie Hunnam) character is a storytelling trope with no reason to exist other than to move the plot to a more conspicuous location. When Snyder, Shay Hatten (Army of the Dead), and Kurt Johnstad’s (300, Atomic Blonde) script des find a character to spark an emotional impact, we meet them so briefly that the big scene the film builds towards isn’t entirely earned, and the audience feels cheated. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is not worth watching in theaters or streaming until we find out where the companion part is headed. That leads us to the most interesting character, a robot named Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins), who explores the theory of “autonomous robots.” However, we don’t see the character again until a brief shot at the end. This is the most exciting theme in the film—your only hope is if this is explored more in Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver. Almost everything else is an exercise of science-fiction banality. In the meantime, you’ll be stuck with the same Indiana Jones’s oppressive totalitarian characters, The Matrix’s Existentialism regarding reality vs illusion, and Star Wars rebellion recycled thousands of times in our lifetime. The second part of Mr. Snyder’s vision may relieve some criticisms. However, the likelihood of anyone having the stamina to stomach the second film after this mess is a gamble you shouldn’t net the house on. M.N.

"Dec 21, 2023"," Rebel Moon opens in an agrarian colony on Veldt, a moon orbiting a ringed planet much like Saturn. When the colony is invaded by soldiers from the Imperium, it’s up to the orphaned Kora (Sofia Boutella) to recruit fighters to help the villagers. The problem is the rebels are scattered all over the galaxy. Before Kora departs, she takes out a dozen or so enemies armed only with a hatchet – the first of many well-executed battles spread throughout the movie. On a desert planet, Kora finds Tarak (Staz Nair), a warrior who can communicate with the animal world. Next, on a dying world polluted by mining, Nemesis (Bae Doona) displays expert sword skills. Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced Regent general, joins the team from a gladiator planet. Meanwhile, the rebels are pursued by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), a ruthless killer who commands the King’s Gaze spaceship. No one is safe from his men, not even the mercenaries trying to betray the rebels. If it seems like you’ve seen this before, you probably have. The director has cited The Dirty Dozen and The Lord of the Rings among his inspirations; it’s easy to pick out nods to other big-budget blockbusters as well. Rebel Moon is as easy to read as a billboard and about as deep. Once it gets going, the movie sprints at a furious pace, stopping only to indulge in too many slow-motion leaps, kicks and punches. Because not everything in Rebel Moon makes sense. Bae’s Nemesis is fascinating, and her battle scene deep in the bowels of a cobalt mine is a highlight of the movie, but her powers are confusing, and like the other rebels, she doesn’t get much chance to explain herself. Snyder, who also shot Rebel Moon and co-wrote its script, has huge ambitions for the project. The second part arrives in April, and an animated series and RPG computer game have been announced. That’s to say nothing of extended, R-rated cuts of parts one and two. Will fatigue set in first?",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2023"," The allusionism is strong with this one. Zack Snyder’s latest visual extravaganza, the loftily titled Netflix production Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, draws more than a modicum of influence from Akira Kurosawa’s samurai cinema and George Lucas’ galactic franchise. Of course, Lucas already appropriated bushido honor and aspects of Japanese culture, along with story elements from Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress (1958), to develop the original Star Wars (1977). Snyder’s movie merely draws out the connection further with an amalgam of both filmmakers, offering a hodgepodge of ideas from better movies, repurposed here to lackluster effect. Aside from a few neat aliens and a rousing laser gun battle or two, there’s not much in these familiar proceedings to maintain the viewer’s interest. The movie plays less like an affectionate homage and more like a lifeless and derivative composite, underserviced by Snyder’s interest in cool images over compelling characters. Armed with a talented cast and occasionally impressive visuals, Rebel Moon neither transcends nor pays adequate respect to its influences, making for a flagrant and pedestrian imitation of better material.  The story is an unmistakable copycat of Seven Samurai (1954). That Kurosawa’s all-time classic goes uncredited is troubling, if not grounds for a lawsuit. After all, Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone was sued when he remade Kurosawa’s Yojimbo (1962) into the Spaghetti Western A Fistful of Dollars (1964) without permission. And while John Sturges credited Kurosawa’s sprawling and human epic in his remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), Pixar also borrowed the story structure for A Bug’s Life (1998) without an official acknowledgment. To that end, at least Snyder, who conceived the story and co-wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, has some precedent for not giving Kurosawa’s film an “inspired by” reference here, despite his story following that film’s first half almost beat by beat. Lucas has less of a case against Snyder, who merely borrows the intangible flavor of Star Wars for his world-building details—sci-fi movies have been doing that for years. Still, one wonders if Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver, set for release in April 2024, will continue with Kurosawa’s story structure. Probably so, given that Part One has so few original ideas.  Accented with overblown choral music, the story takes place in a galaxy ruled by an imperialist Motherworld, whose assassinated King (Cary Elwes) was replaced by a brutal ruler, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). Determined to quash any dissenters, Balisarius orders Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to hunt down rebels. Landing on the habitable moon called Veidt, home to a vaguely Icelandic community of peaceful farmers who have just completed their annual harvest orgy to appease their gods, Noble orders the locals to hand over the bulk of their next reaping in ten weeks to feed his army. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a farmer and former warrior with a mysterious past connected to the Motherworld, refuses to comply and sets out with her village’s harvest manager, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), to find others who will fight the imperial forces on their behalf. Instead of visiting a local village, as in Seven Samurai, Kora and Gunnar enlist the help of a rogue bounty hunter, Kai (Charlie Hunnam), to help them travel to nearby planets and convince proven fighters to help their cause.  While Kora and Gunnar, profoundly uninteresting characters, search for help, Snyder introduces us to a familiar band of renegades and freedom fighters, each drawn from tropes in Kurosawa’s work: a master of swordplay, Nemesis (Doona Bae); a former general on a gladiatorial world who wants to forget that he surrendered (Djimon Hounsou); Tarak (Staz Nair), a perpetually shirtless warrior who can bond with animals; and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), an insurgent leader who commands the rebellion. Most of these personalities are so thin that the plot mechanics, not the characters and their choices, drive the story. Like Seven Samurai, the movie finds them outnumbered and clashing with their enemies, building to what will probably be a much larger showdown in the sequel. But unlike Kurosawa’s masterpiece, Snyder isn’t interested in giving the farmers much gradation; his treatment is rather like Star Wars in that respect, where good and evil are polarized. Snyder’s grasp of the dimensions in Kurosawa’s film is about as tenuous as the remakes by Sturges or Antoine Fuqua (in 2016). Though the plot follows Kurosawa, most of Rebel Moon’s presentation resembles a Star Wars movie. Snyder originally developed the idea for Lucas’ universe, and his cinematic sampling is unsubtle, from alien-filled cantinas to bad guys imbued with Nazi characteristics. Even the sound effects recall Ben Burtt’s beeps, bloops, and pew-pews from Star Wars. Among Snyder’s innovations—nay, oddities—is the self-aware droid named Jimmy, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, who has a few small scenes early on and for whom Snyder has big things planned, apparently, given its obscurely and unexplained horned appearance in the finale. On the plus side, Jena Malone’s appearance as a spidery humanoid makes for a creepy, inspired sequence, though it leads to Snyder revealing Nemesis’ veritable lightsabers, another dull reference. But the allusions to better movies don’t limit themselves to Kurosawa and Lucas. A sequence straight out of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) finds a character bowing to a creature that looks suspiciously like a hippogriff.  As ever, the director’s capacity for grandiose-looking cinema remains impressive. Serving as director of photography, Snyder is a compelling visualist, creating iconic images, the ambitions of which often outweigh the capabilities of his reported $160 million-plus budget. The result occasionally has the look and feel of Lucas’ prequel trilogy, with flat backdrops and a deadened digital sheen. Nevertheless, this is unmistakably a Snyder production, complete with his signature use of slow motion to create a sense of awed suspension during action scenes. But even that is a Kurosawa technique. To be sure, Kurosawa employed a similar tactic in Seven Samurai, where he edited slow-motion sequences into otherwise fast-paced action, creating a dramatic juxtaposition of film speeds. That’s been one of Snyder’s tricks since his earliest work, and it’s used here on dramatically falling seeds and a spear-wielding soldier leaping into the air—images that recall Snyder’s own Dawn of the Dead (2004) and 300 (2007). If this all sounds like I’m dwelling too much on Snyder’s inspirations, know that if Rebel Moon featured better storytelling, perhaps I wouldn’t only see or care about its pilfering. For instance, Lucas wasn’t exactly reinventing the wheel when he made Star Wars; he pieced together aspects of Flash Gordon serials and Japanese samurai cinema to create something familiar but new. But Lucas’ distinct characters, the actors who played them, and the world-building were so inspired that the antecedents hardly registered. He transcended his influences, which is the mark of compelling art. Snyder’s efforts have too few new ideas to distinguish Rebel Moon from its iconic antecedents, making it feel more like a pastiche than an inspired piece of filmmaking that uses its sources as a launchpad. Even as a melange of better material, the PG-13-rated Rebel Moon fails to impress, making the prospect of his promised R-rated extended cut far less intriguing than his alternate take on Justice League (2021). Rather, the upcoming extended version feels like a Netflix gimmick designed to replicate the (faux) hullabaloo around the whole #releasethesnydercut campaign, which, as marketing goes, proves as hollow as the movie it’s attempting to promote.

"Dec 20, 2023"," “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire” starts out strong, if derivative. After some confusing voice-over narration, the camera pans down from a shot of a spaceship against a backdrop of stars to a small farming collective on an isolated moon. We meet Kora (Sofia Boutella), a newcomer to the community. She’s a hard worker, but unwilling to fully connect with her compatriots because of her mysterious past. Into this peaceful agrarian milieu steps Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), the leader of a battalion of stormtroopers representing something called the Motherworld. They demand tribute in the form of crops and leave soldiers behind to monitor the town’s next harvest. When the soldiers begin to assault the townspeople, Kora and a fellow farmer (Michiel Huisman) leave to recruit a fighting force for protection. From there on, the movie becomes a confusing, overstuffed and overwritten mess of world building, lackluster action and overly ambitious but disappointing effects work, focusing on setting up what you might call the extended Rebel Moon-iverse instead of telling a compelling (or coherent) story. The bulk of the narrative feels like the middle of a story stretched out over two hours, with the ending lopped off. (Perhaps we’re expected to wait until April, when “Rebel Moon — Part Two: The Scargiver” comes out?) Sure, there’s something of a climactic battle at the end, but it lacks an emotional payoff. Overall, the characters are one-dimensional as Kora travels from planet to planet recruiting badass but interchangeable volunteers. One major character development occurs with little buildup and no real understanding of motivation. Later, a different character is suddenly killed. Instead of an emotionally intense moment, we’re left wondering: Did this person add anything to the story in the first place? The effects-heavy film struggles to render the frame-filling planets and spaceships that appear throughout, frequently looking no better than a well-done video game cut scene. In the final action sequence, the CGI is quite poor, indistinguishable from a cheap Disney Plus show. But the real problem with “Rebel Moon,” whose story is taken directly from “Seven Samurai” — or at least the first half of Akira Kurosawa’s 1954 epic — is structure. Every major story thread is left dangling. “Moon” has lots of setup but no resolution, treading water for most of its overlong running time. It also has the artistic fingerprints of Zack Snyder — a populist auteur more akin to Michael Bay than Wes Anderson — all over it: the human form, shot in slow motion; extreme color grading in fully computer-generated environments; and compositions that feel ripped from a comic book. (Snyder serves as director, co-writer, producer and cinematographer here.) Over the course of the film, all the slo-mo and visceral violence — used not to define action but to highlight individual movement, preventing the scenes from having any spatial context — becomes grating. Every action scene is shot the same way, and the shock loses its effectiveness as it is recycled. Coupled with the film’s frequently stagnant plot, his oppressive style results in an experience that somehow becomes simultaneously droll and monotonous. The result is excitement without weight, contributing to a lack of clear stakes that the film suffers from throughout. It’s worth comparing the film to “Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope,” from which Snyder takes his aesthetic cues. At each turn, it feels like the filmmaker is trying to one-up George Lucas, to deliver a version of the first Star Wars film on steroids. But “Moon” frequently falls short, like a picture of a picture, mimicking images and character types but failing to capture the heart and magic of its predecessor. It’s a film stripped of joy and whimsy, instead pursuing a tone of self-seriousness. Would it kill him to put a single joke in? Ultimately, “Rebel Moon” is an ambitious failure. It attempts to portray a world that is massive and teeming with life but just comes across as small and empty.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2023"," If you’ve watched Star Wars or The Lord of The Rings (who hasn’t?) you’ve basically already seen Zack Snyder’s embarrassingly derivative space opera Rebel Moon. Snyder has stated he was initially inspired by George Lucas’ films and Akira Kurosawa but this plays out like fanfiction. Snyder has amassed a gorgeous ensemble cast with Sofia Boutella in her first lead role as a woman on a mission to assemble a gang of warriors to defeat an evil dictatorship and Ed Skrein as the leader of the brutal army. Part One in a planned trilogy (the second film is already lined up for release in April) is a ‘getting the gang together’ narrative. All the characters are introduced in a ploddingly tedious style, with cringing nods to sci-fi and fantasy classics – it’s like a ‘Where’s Wally?’ cornucopia of multiple, relentless references which will have you holding your head in despair. Michiel Huisman plays an innocent farmer who tags along with Boutella’s Kora and they are joined by Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae (who looks very cool in a wickedly large hat), Staz Nair, Ray Fisher and E. Duffy in their quest. Charlie Hunnam turns up too adding a Northern Irish(?) accent to a bounty of many perplexing accents – but maybe that will all be explained in later films. Anthony Hopkins throws his charming accent into the pot, too, as narrator and sentient robot. The film sets up many narrative threads and introduces so many characters to the point that much of the dialogue is simply just exposition. Thematically, AI, colonisation and the environment are presented but not in any original way. Visually fans of Snyder may be endeared by his many slo-mo sequences and wide-shots of vast planets but his hackneyed approach to a dark and violent space opera means he forsakes any charm, flair or humour.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2023"," The confused nature of the theatrical window for streamer-owned films reached a new level of absurdity with Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. Not only is this blockbuster behemoth merely the first installment of a two-part film—the second, subtitled The Scargiver, is set to be released in April—it’s a truncated version of its maker’s substantially longer preferred cut, which makes the film two-thirds of one-half of a story.  Rebel Moon began life as a Star Wars project before Snyder’s concept was turned down, and the resulting film often sounds as though the director and co-writers Kurt Johnsta and Shay Hatten did little more to their draft than perform a find-and-replace for any terms trademarked by Disney. The film even piggybacks off of George Lucas’s indebtedness to Kurosawa Akira: Its protagonist, Kora (Sofia Boutella), is a disillusioned veteran of the “Motherworld” autocracy who, in a blatant nod to Seven Samurai, resolves to raise an army to defend the farming community that’s taken her in and now faces subjugation by their galactic overlords. Taking a cue from the original Star Wars trilogy’s contrast of a diverse rebellion against a homogenous empire, Snyder assembles a rich cast to play the resistance fighters on the remote moon of Veldt, from Djimon Hounsou to Doona Bae to Justice League’s Ray Fisher, who stand tall against a pointedly all-white cast of foes decked out in the most explicitly Naziesque uniforms to grace a sci-fi film since Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers. Snyder has a fine cast of actors to work with, but the film’s script saddles them with such lugubrious exposition dumps that everyone ends up sounding like a purely functional video-game NPC. The awkward dialogue is made worse by jagged edits that skip erratically over basic narrative developments. More than once, characters simply join Kora’s party without ever clearly stating their support, and elsewhere A Child of Fire careens from planet to planet in the space of a single cut, giving no sense of the scale of the story’s galactic setting.  The film’s visuals are another showcase for Snyder’s personal brand of metal-toned, alternately dazzling and exhausting sensibilities. Some of the environments that the heroes traverse are mesmerizing, most notably a colossal cobalt mining operation that’s turned the surface of a planet into a shimmering haze as global warming bakes the cityscapes of extraction facilities.  Elsewhere, however, certain locations were clearly not been envisioned beyond the narrow confines of the scenes that utilize them, making some planets seem as if they’re little more than a floating ship dock shrouded in the fog of a gas giant. There are also persistent tics, like an anamorphic blur at the edges of the frame, that, coupled with the aggressively flattened CGI backgrounds, undercut the opulence of Snyder’s compositions. The action scenes are a highlight of A Child of Fire, and if Snyder had been able to make this a Star Wars-branded film as he originally intended, it would easily boast the most coherent, well-executed stunt sequences since Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith. Doona Bae’s mysterious assassin, Nemesis, wields knockoff lightsabers with a practiced smoothness that’s matched by the elegant manner in which Snyder captures the warrior’s hair-trigger reflexes and precise attacks. Similarly, Boutella puts her dancer-honed control of body movement and gesture to great use to convey Kora’s prowess as a sharpshooter and fighter.  Snyder, as ever, over-relies on slow motion and speed-ramping to maximize the “cool” factor of gunshots and stabbings. There are numerous instances where he’s clearly had to cut around intended gore to get a PG-13 rating, but even so, there’s an up-close brutality to the combat here that’s worlds removed from the sanitized nature of so much contemporary blockbuster action. But the relative grace of A Child of Fire’s action direction only underscores how disjointed and generic the rest of the film is. A longer cut may correct the frequent lapses of narrative logic, but that leaves the issue that these characters and their conflicts aren’t compelling enough to generate much interest in spending more time with them. Snyder relies on the audience’s pre-existing knowledge of space-opera conventions to do the heavy lifting of character development in lieu of providing any novel takes on well-worn tropes, which calls into question why it will take roughly the length of a miniseries just to fully introduce this property.

"Dec 20, 2023"," The Pitch: A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away… an evil empire led by a dastardly villain (Ed Skrein) hunts down the last vestiges of a growing rebellion, fueled by the death of their godlike emperor. One such outer world that must be brought to heel is a humble farming planet, where a young, beautiful villager (Sofia Boutella) fights back against the soldiers looking to take their grain to feed their troops. Recognizing that retaliation is nigh, Boutella’s Kora drags her everyman farmer sidekick (Michiel Huisman) off to space, to collect a rag-tag group of ronin from across the galaxy to help her defend their village. How many? Oh, about seven will do. Seven Samurai Bring A New Hope to a NeverEnding Story: Beware any filmmaker bragging that their hip new sci-fi property is “the next Star Wars.” Doubly so with Zack Snyder, an auteur frustratingly always threading the needle between idiocy and genius, a straightforward purveyor of Renaissance spectacle whose works often need a little… massaging to make work. So it goes with Rebel Moon Part One, a film already split in half before seemingly chopped down to a manageable length for theaters before it hits Netflix in a matter of days. It’s a neutered work, one that wears its influences so brazenly on its sleeve it’s a wonder Kurosawa doesn’t rise from the grave and file suit. Oftentimes, that’s not so bad: at its most entertaining, Rebel Moon hearkens back to all those chintzy cult Star Wars riffs that burst onto the scene in the late ’70s and early ’80s, from Krull to Battle Beyond the Stars to Metalstorm: The Destruction of Jared-Syn. But where those films had the charms of a low budget and the brazen attitudes of a company like the Cannon Group, Rebel Moon does a poor job of mimicking the first half of two movies you already know you like. Part One – A Child of Fire essentially constitutes the bit in Seven Samurai where the villagers assemble their team: go to one location, get introduced to a specific warrior and their quirks, move on. Here, it takes the form of an “assemble the team” montage that lasts for two straight hours, after a sluggish first act that establishes the stakes (and a glimmer of a more interesting subplot involving a warrior robot, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, demonstrating a budding sense of compassion). From there, we whiz from one goofily-named planet to the next, the second act feeling like you’re binging an entire season of Love, Death, & Robots. In addition to Kora and Huisman’s Gunnar, there’s Han Solo-type Kai (Charlie Hunnam, trying desperately to infuse a sense of charm into this thing, not that the sound mixing can help you make out the dialogue), who agrees to transport them on his Not-Millennium-Falcon. Staz Nair’s Tarek is a muscly mix of Conan the Barbarian and Atreyu from The NeverEnding Story, proving his worth taming a majestic black griffin we never get to see again.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2023"," For better or worse, Rebel Moon is the “Most” Zack Snyder you can get. I say that while only having seen part one of this two-part story and the hacked-up PG-13 cut of a film that clearly aimed for an R-rating, and it still feels like this is a maximalist vision of the “visionary” filmmaker. As his devoted followers have shown, there’s no doubt of an appeal for some when it comes to the hyper-stylized features he has delivered over the years. Whether it’s his striking choices in visual language, kinetic action sequences, or the abundant use of slow-motion photography, Snyder certainly seems impressed with the elements he’s gathered together for this latest venture he pitched ages ago as Star Wars meets Seven Samurai. Well, as unconcerned as I am with how much two of the most influential films ever made impacted this film’s ideas, my focus was more drawn into why I’m not having as much fun as I would have liked. Sure, the film looks nice, but this wasn’t exactly giving me new hope for Snyder. Some convoluted narration by Anthony Hopkins (as Jimmy!) provides a setup for what’s happening in a distant galaxy. Essentially, a ruthless empire (the Motherworld) is trying to snuff out any rebel activity they find. Our main focus is on Kora (Sofia Boutella), a warrior with a past who now lives on a farming colony. Bad things go down when the evil empire’s forces arrive, led by Ed Skrein’s Atticus Noble. A village chief is murdered, and Kora kills a group of soldiers in return. Knowing no good can come of this, She teams with a farmer (Michiel Huisman) and a mercenary (Charlie Hunnam) to fly off to different planets in an effort to recruit several more warriors to help them fight back against the Motherworld and protect their land. Here’s the thing: as oddly divisive as Snyder seems to be, I do mostly like what he offers. His films feel largely like giant playgrounds where a filmmaker was given the chance to lean into a variety of his inspirations for the sake of delivering visually intense entertainment. Granted, I wasn’t huge on his choices for his DC films, and I don’t tend to leave thinking his movies have much to say beyond surface-level thematics, but the guy works hard to impress his audience. So what went wrong here? Well, to start, while I don’t find fault in having the two prominent films as the source for the most inspiration (this isn’t even the first film to use that pitch – check out the Roger Corman-produced Battle Beyond the Star), it is sort of odd to see Snyder try to mess around with that formula by using less impressive tropes to shake it up. Whether it’s character motivations or the understanding that we’re only getting half of the story, it’s a film that is over two hours yet still feels oddly lacking in details that could have made a difference. Granted, I must believe the 3-hour R-rated version has enough to round out these issues, but they nonetheless exist in this form of the film. With that in mind, I would have at least enjoyed seeing this cast really dig into their personas. Sadly, there’s a lot of repetition taking place that doesn’t allow these people to amount to much in this first half. Djimon Hounsou, for example, surely has a lot more to expand on regarding his imprisoned general, but we barely get to learn what he’s all about. Instead, we meet him and a few others, hear what they have to say through a speech that supplies info without much heart behind it, and then move on to meet the next person. Assembling the team takes place in the film’s second act, which at least allows for a variety of locations to be seen. The first act doesn’t get things off to the most energizing of starts. We are presumably supposed to enjoy the world-building and gain sympathy for the characters embodied by citizens that include a young girl set to eventually be threatened with sexual assault and a very bearded Corey Stoll, who is certainly welcome, but the braids within this bristly face make me wonder if there’s more about the society that we could appreciate to justify this aesthetic. Regardless, it all takes a while to get through in a film that should either be aiming for the urgency akin to Star Wars or a stronger sense of place, as in Kurosawa’s classic. As mentioned, the team assembly portion of the film does mix things up, yet it feels like there’s a dearth of screen charisma to make all of this more fun and exciting. My chief example is Boutella, who is undoubtedly a capable physical performer but doesn’t quite have what it takes to be a solid lead here. To his credit, Hunnam is the one person who feels game on the side of the good guys. He has the right kind of attitude to play with the punk spirit Snyder has for his more brutal depiction of a galaxy far, far away. And Skrein is effective enough as a baddie who is both odd enough to have alien/robo worms sucking at plugs in his skin yet tight enough to dress like the lead singer of an indie rock group for much of the film’s second half. The weird quirks, much like in many of Snyder’s films, allow for areas that let the film stand out better than just seeing incredible sights in extreme slow motion. With that said, I’ve never questioned Snyder’s ability to deliver well-staged action in his features, and yet this film suffers from editing issues that clearly need to hide the more violent moments. By the time we get to the third act, the action is at least big enough where the scope can allow for less intimate forms of battle that need to remove shots to appeal to an intended rating. Still, it’s an odd step backward in a department Snyder has never struggled with in the past. Am I saying a lot rides on the second part (The Scargiver, due in April 2024), to make up for what I feel is lacking here? Not quite. This film has a proper structure to leave it as a singular enough feature, regardless of all the loose ends. No, I would wish for a better understanding of why I should be more invested in all of this. Surely, it cannot just amount to how cool it all looks. The worlds we visit didn’t inspire me to want to learn more about them, the characters mostly fall flat, which includes Doona Bae as a cybernetic fighter with twin laser swords. So why can’t this be more fulfilling? I root for things like this to succeed (Mortal Engines, FTW!), but Rebel Moon doesn’t quite have the droids I was looking for or much else beyond Snyder’s drive to make a polished, big-budget space opera.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2023"," Just hearing the name Zack Snyder seems to invoke wildly different impulses and reactions depending on which side of the filmmaker you sit. In one group you have the Snyder loyalists who saturate any and everything he puts out while pushing back on even the slightest criticism of his work. But just as feral and often more belligerent are the anti-Snyder mudslingers who never pass up on a chance to belittle and berate Snyder’s movies and his fans.  That brings us to his latest project, “Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire”. Mark it down, you can expect fans to love it and defend it till their dying breath. Meanwhile Snyder carpers will be chomping at the bit to tear it down early and often. But how is it really? Once you weed out the voices of the predisposed and get beyond the hyperbole and grandstanding, is “Rebel Moon” any good? It’s actually quite good although you can tell it’s only a slice of a bigger and better whole. The existence of a director’s cut is out there and this current cut all but confirms it. To Snyder’s credit he gives us a good taste of this new original universe he has created. The world is full of vibrant and diverse locations. There are plenty of interesting people, races, and creatures. And the battle lines are clearly distinguished between an oppressive militaristic regime and the valiant group of rebels who rise up to fight back. But they’ll need a leader who can bring together the fiercest warriors from across the galaxy if they are to have any chance of winning. That’s hardly what you would call an original story, but Snyder is fine with that. He hasn’t been shy about honoring his inspirations, and he doesn’t attempt to hide his open embrace of numerous classic science-fiction tropes. He has set out to make a dark space fantasy that plays like “Seven Samurai” meets “Star Wars”. It’s not that his story is bold and unique. It’s that it is unfolding with characters he has crafted and within a world he has created.  Still, this cut of “Rebel Moon” is more enticing than fulfilling. I found myself thoroughly riveted while in its world yet it left me needing more of it. For example, the action in this version feels sanitized, with the camera too often turning away to ensure a PG-13 rating (Snyder has said his full cut is wilder and edgier). But more than that, key supporting characters often feel like sketches rather than portraits. Their motivations are vague and their backgrounds (which in this movie play a big part in defining them) are mostly mysteries. More than anywhere else in the film, it’s here that the cuts stand out most.  The cast is made up of an intriguing array of talent led by Sofia Boutella. She plays Kora who lives a quiet life in a small, tight-knit farming village on the mostly peaceful planet of Veidt. Though considered independent, Veidt exists in the shadow of the Motherworld which is ruled by Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). The Motherworld was once devoted to peace and prosperity. But following the mysterious assassination of its King, Queen and Princess, the then ambitious senator Balisarius rose to power. He created a massive military known as the Imperium and has used it to strengthen his reign and expand his empire. Kora’s village is visited by an Imperium squad under the command of Admiral Atticus Noble (a fittingly vile Ed Skrein). He’s on a mission to hunt down and destroy pockets of resistance that are believed to be hiding among the outer planets. Noble forces the village into a pact to provide an unreasonable amount of grain for his armies. He gives them ten months to have it ready before showing them the consequences of failing him. After a group of remaining Imperium soldiers attempt to rape a young local girl, Kora kills them all, revealing a side of herself she has kept hidden from her community. Due to her secret past with the Imperium, Kora knows Noble will retaliate after hearing his soldiers are dead. So she sets off to recruit warriors to help stand against the Imperium. She convinces a fellow villager named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) who has connections with the resistance to accompany her. They’re helped off the planet by a mercenary and smuggler named Kai (Charlie Hunnam). From there Snyder whisks us from one visually rich and interesting planet to the next, recruiting a new member to his band at each stop. They include a former Imperium general (Djimon Hounsou), a cyborg swordmaster (Bae Doona), a prince in bondage (Staz Nair), and a fierce freedom fighter (Ray Fisher). Together they make a formidable team despite many of them lacking in individual detail. As with other Snyder movies, “Rebel Moon” features most of the filmmaker’s visual trademarks. There’s the jaw-dropping CGI, lots of stylish slow-motion, and crisply choreographed action sequences, all of it shot by Snyder himself. And as the story progresses we get several fun nods to past movies, television shows, and genres. As the full title clearly indicates, this is just the first part of Snyder’s opus. But he does bring it to a kinetic climax before setting up his next film due out in April.  Of course before the next film releases we will be getting the extended cut of Part One in early 2024. This begs the question, why release the first film like this? From every indication it was a Netflix decision. It seems Snyder was given the green light to “go nuts” and create whatever he wanted under the agreement that Netflix would release a neutered PG-13 version first. Was it to make a version of the film that was suitable for a broader audience? Was it some bizarre tactic to try and recreate the Snyder Cut zeal? Either way, this cut certainly entertained me. But what it did most was excite me for the potentially better extended cut that’s just around the corner.  I’m one of those who is on the fence with Zack. No strong opinion one way or the other. This one just didn’t hook me with the trailer, and I guess based on his “history” maybe in the back of my mind I thought he would be holding back some footage – which you feel is the case. I know you can’t do much “world-building” in a couple of minutes…but I still think I’ll wait for the rest of this film to appear first and then maybe give it a go. Perfectly understandable. I can’t begrudge anyone for waiting for his “complete” film. But as I mentioned in the review, it seems like this is a Netflix choice. Releasing an early PG-13 cut was part of their terms. I’m really looking forward to seeing the complete cut (due out in a month or two). The movie for me had some good things and some questionable things. The questionable things were the antagonists had a Nazi type empire where even their outfits made it seem like WW2. The aliens felt out of place like what were their purpose.  The gathering of the crew story was rushed and not good. The flying crow thing just to have it kill the guy. The lady spider fight, and everyone’s is just watching except the farmer. The recruiting of the brother and sister st first they are like no, then they are like yes with no real compelling reason. The double cross was bad as it was out of place for me. Then they force the farmer to do the deed and he kills the guy. I was expecting the farmer to actually do some super heroic hidden thing like whip out a light saber blade and go to town to free everyone.  The visuals were great, I loved the small farm and how they work as a community. The flashbacks were cool but other than that the movie lacked a lot of things I was expecting in this one.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2023"," Zack Snyder makes it hard for us who are his fans to defend him sometimes. He takes bold swings at original content with grand aspirations, let’s use the critically-panned Sucker Punch as an example, but when those misguided efforts misfire, they misfire with reckless abandon. Rebel Moon, an “original” sci-fi space opera originally pitched as a Star Wars film inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s classic Seven Samurai, sounds awesome on paper. All of Snyder’s films sound awesome on paper. But in actual execution, it is a convoluted, shallow imitation of Kurosawa and numerous other sci-fi epics that Snyder and co-writers Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad have consumed but missed the best aspects of. Going into Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire, I was ready to declare this as Snyder’s magnum opus, and the first great movie franchise for Netflix. Coming out, I was stunned at how unusually terrible the film is. In just about every way it fails to inspire, fails to connect you with any of its characters, fails to make you give a damn about the battle between good and evil. Snyder thumbs his nose at Lucasfilm, who rejected his Star Wars pitch, right from the beginning. He throws you right into long-winded narration by a solemn Anthony Hopkins, who voices the peaceful droid Jimmy. Snyder dares you to hate his movie for this leaden intro, which isn’t that different from the start of A New Hope, complete with a pan down from the stars to the farming planet of Veidt. There’s a lot of other unfathomable stuff thrown out there, historical events we have no clue about, places and people named without any context. It’s all a slog, but the gist is that Motherworld, a clear stand-in for the Empire, is evil and they are taking over the galaxy at the expense of the weak. There’s a rebellion brewing against them, of course. The problem with Snyder’s films, the good and the bad ones, is that he presumes the audience walks in already invested in everything. Then Snyder provides absolutely no reason for you to actually get invested. Even when the premise is as tried ‘n true as the classic “gathering of heroes” seen in Seven Samurai and The Magnificent Seven, it’s done in as cold and unfeeling a way as possible. Then again, perhaps that’s fitting for the wooden performance of star Sofia Boutella, who plays the mysterious ex-Motherworld soldier, Kora. She’s found a home in the peaceful farming community on Veidt. When the bad guys suddenly show up, their starship looming over the planet like a dark cloud, she’s the only one who knows what’s going to happen. Well, other than us. While it takes an excrutiating amount of time to get there, the cruel Atticus Noble unleashes the evil empire’s wrath on the people. Kora fights back and along with her pal Gunnar (Michael Huisman), sets out to recruit others to help the town defend itself from inevitable payback. It’s pointles to go through the monotonous recruitment drive, filled with big name stars given absolutely nothing to do, playing vaguely “cool” characters with zero personality. Charlie Hunnam as a cheap Han Solo knockoff, an extremely bored Djimon Hounsou (a victim of too many bad blockbusters wasting his talent), Staz Nair, Doona Bae, Jena Malone (as a damn spidery thing! She deserves better!), poor poor Ray Fisher, Fra Free, and Cleopatra Coleman have roles that don’t amount to much. You won’t remember a damn thing that any of them does, even when they’re in the midst of sweeping visual flourishes during one of Snyder’s trademark slow-mo action sequences. All of the characters we’re introduced to feel like pale copies of what would’ve been prominent Star Wars figures, and perhaps that’s because they are. A lot of Rebel Moon feels like it was written to be a part of Lucasfilm’s galaxy far far away, but failing that, they simply changed the names and nothing else. That would explain why all of Kora’s recruits feel like different versions of fallen Jedi. Snyder has a sweet spot, and he’s found it in fun, energetic, popcorn movies like Dawn of the Dead, 300, and Army of the Dead. The problem is when Snyder gets a big head about whatever project he’s working on. Snyder in serious mode is always a drag. Rebel Moon is stuffy, pretentious nonsense that shows zero self-awareness and the only thing that could make it worse is an even longer director’s cut…which we already know is coming in 2024.  I won’t go so far as to say my confidence in Snyder is shattered forever. I bet the next Army of the Dead will be killer. But I don’t want to see more Rebel Moon, and if this were a movie on the big screen with box office and critical demands there probably wouldn’t be one. But we know that’s not how Netflix works. It’s hard viewership data that counts, and Rebel Moon will get a lot of eyeballs on it, for better or worse. Maybe when Part Two: The Scargiver arrives next year it’ll change my mind about the cinematic universe Snyder is attempting to build. Stranger things have happened. They say that imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, but sometimes it looks like a slap to the face.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2023"," Is there anything more terrifying in a film’s title than the words “Part One?” Here it’s a serious threat. “A Child of Fire” is so bad it’s created a new level of awfulness. Thanks to some excellent C.G.I. it’s gorgeous to look at, but so empty of interest that the false beauty is meaningless. In the opening-night public screening this critic attended the only time the audience reacted to anything – anything – was Charlie Hunnam’s appalling Northern Irish accent. It is difficult to understand how a movie so carefully and expertly made could be so devoid of feeling. It’s like 134 minutes of trying to touch a fish by putting your hand to the aquarium glass, only not nearly as much fun. At least if the fish are something new to look at, you can forgive the unbreachable void, but the further trouble with “A Child of Fire” is there is literally not one new thing in it. Kora (Sofia Boutella, and more on whom later) is introduced plowing a field and flirting with a “simple farmer” named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman). An evil army shows up, headed by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein, who hopefully in his personal life loves fluffy sweaters and is kind to animals), who immediately kills the village leader (Corey Stoll, under an embarrassing beard) with his big punishment stick and threatens everyone with dastardly consequences in around three months’ time if a big grain harvest isn’t ready. The villagers decide their hard work will prove their value. Kora, who’s not lived there very long, disagrees and tries to sneak away, but a charming village girl (Charlotte Maggi) is threatened with rape by a bunch of soldiers with very strong South African and New Zealand accents, so Kora slaughters them all in slow motion and the villagers suddenly agree they have to fight. That means Kora and Gunnar have to get the band of samurai, or something, together, and suddenly we’re on a tour of sci-fi planets in bounty hunter Kai’s (Mr. Hunnam) ship. On the “How to Train Your Dragon”/“Avatar” planet they find Tarak (Staz Nair, whose abs are the most interesting thing on screen in this entire thing). On the Hong Kong action planet they find Nemesis (Doona Bae) – although in a modernist twist to the Asian-lady-assassin-chasing-revenge-for-her-murdered-family trope, she can talk. On the “Gladiator” planet they find Djimon Hounsou under a beard so magnificent it indicates he’s been hanging out there ever since Russell Crowe broke up with him; and on the “Braveheart”/Squidward planet they find Dorrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), who is remarkably eager to ditch the rebellion he’s been leading for a suicide mission. It is so silly, but the tone is so portentous and the fights so dragged out through the slow-motion stylings that you can’t even laugh. It’s like being hugged to death by a suicidal clown. And this is without getting into the incredibly serious voiceover by Anthony Hopkins, which talks a lot about the dominion of the motherworld and the unbroken bloodline of the slain kings as the opening shot shows a penis-shaped spaceship flying out of a vulva-shaped breach in the atmosphere; and it’s not even funny. Somehow director Zack Snyder has managed to take the wrong lessons from every single one of his previous movies and make something so bad it boggles the mind. This is especially infuriating because it’s past time for Ms. Boutella to have a juicy lead role. She combines the alien intrigue of Tilda Swinton with the sleek physicality of Zoe Saldana and somehow absolutely no one in Hollywood knows what to do with her. Mr. Snyder shaved the side of her head and dressed her up in proto-fascist costumes for a whole bunch of meaningful flashbacks, but all that’s going to achieve for her is some funny feelings belonging to the men in the “Release the Snyder Cut” hats in the audience. There is just nothing here. The fact that “Rebel Moon” was rejected from the “Star Wars” universe speaks very highly of them, but to see a film that makes you long for the unforgiven atrocity that is “The Rise of Skywalker” is so bleak it’s hard to fathom. How did American blockbusters get so desperate?",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2023"," Love him or hate him, Zack Snyder is the undisputed king of what can only be classified as a “trailer moment.” In his latest effort, Rebel Moon, those moments are myriad, complete with the speed-ramped, stylized violence that made Snyder the most divisive auteur of the 21st century. As with his previous efforts, Snyder paints the world of Rebel Moon in big, bombastic strokes. The characters therein aren’t fully fleshed-out beings so much as they are vessels for this supersized, galaxy-spanning legend-in-the-making. Rebel Moon infamously started off as Snyder’s pitch for an earnest, R-rated Star Wars story, and in the broad strokes, the film plainly evokes the galaxy far, far away. But despite its well-publicized Star Wars parallels, Snyder’s sci-fi epic is still very much its own thing.  Rebel Moon is a melting pot of modern myth, cherry-picking some of our most recognizable legends to craft a tale that’s stately, sexy, and fiercely entertaining. Snyder & co. have clearly done their homework in crafting this new, original world, and it shines best in the tactility of its worldbuilding — if only it slowed down long enough to relish in it. Rebel Moon is already long. The film’s been split in two halves, but even Part One: A Child of Fire clocks in a smidge above the two-hour mark. That said, it manages to move at a surprisingly brisk pace. It blitzes through the history, myth, and politics of this new galaxy, ruled by an imperial force called the Motherworld. Snyder trades an opening crawl for a prologue narrated by none other than Anthony Hopkins, who paints a picture of a galaxy fraying at the seams, and an imperium working valiantly to stay on top. Hopkins pulls double duty as a sentient robot named Jimmy. As a disgraced imperial soldier that rattles off legends to whoever will listen, he’s an easy stand-in for a droid like C-3PO. But Jimmy is also our window into this war-torn world: when he and a handful of Imperial lackeys are dispatched to the peaceful moon of Veldt, we see just how the Motherworld operates — and why the poor farmers of this realm are willing to risk their lives for even a chance at freedom.  Unfortunately, we don’t get to spend much time with Jimmy once Kora, Sofia Boutella’s soldier-turned-farmer-turned-rebel, embarks on her quest to defend her adopted home from a bloodthirsty imperial occupation. With Michiel Huisman’s lovelorn farm boy Gunner at her side, Kora skips from planet to planet, drafting a rag-tag army for Veldt’s incumbent battle against the Motherworld. Snyder is forever chasing the next big, rousing set piece, each of which serve as a thrilling showcase for Kora’s new recruits.  The fallen prince Tarak (Staz Nair), tames a gryphon-like beast on a sandy fly-by subplot, while Doona Bae’s Nemesis is introduced in the midst of a duel with a spider-y villain (portrayed by Sucker Punch alum Jena Malone). Each member of the ensemble is doing a whole lot with a little, but none more so than Ray Fisher’s Darrian Bloodaxe. He’s one half of the mercenary duo that Kora is working so hard to recruit — and from the moment Fisher steps into frame, it’s obvious why. Fisher was once the heart and soul of Snyder’s Justice League; the weight of the film’s emotional crux rested squarely on his shoulders. His role in Rebel Moon is only his second film to date, but Snyder’s enthusiasm for the actor certainly wasn’t misplaced. Fisher is just one of Rebel Moon’s saving graces, joining the ensemble in their efforts to tease the upcoming Part Two: The Scargiver. But in the end, it always comes back to Kora. Sofia Boutella has long been one of Hollywood’s unsung heroines. Aside from a memorable turn in David Leitch’s Atomic Blonde, the Algerian actor rarely scores a role worthy of her evocative empathy and unique physicality. The stars have aligned in Rebel Moon: Kora is Frodo Baggins, John Wick, and Luke Skywalker combined, equal parts wounded pathos and feral grit.  As with the rest of the ensemble, we don’t learn that much about Kora. What little backstory we do get serves as a shorthand for a well-worn fantasy trope, that of a weary war dog that fears nothing but the loss of those she loves. Every moment spent in her past will make you wish that Rebel Moon could slow down, even for a moment, and give its characters more room to breathe. Is it naive to hope for more than a passing glance into Kora’s inner world, and the worlds of those she rallies to her cause? Probably. Given Rebel Moon’s role as a modern myth, Snyder’s gaze is clearly trained more on the galaxy around them — but that isn’t always a bad thing. The specificity of its world is one of Rebel Moon’s many selling points. No, the film is not perfect, but it more than makes up for its shortcomings with a heady sense of place. Every new pit stop wades deep into one conflict after another, fleshing out a world that’s sexier and more sinister than anything Star Wars could ever hope to be. It’s almost a shame that the film is destined for a streaming release: every shuddering sound cue and slick vignette deserves to be felt in your bones, and seen on the biggest screen possible. Rebel Moon may come off as a blitz of interesting ideas that have yet to be fleshed out in earnest. It doesn’t help that A Child of Fire ends on a cliffhanger of sorts, effectively demanding a follow-up. The optimists among us — and yes, the Snyder bros, too — may read this first installment as an overture, its many loose threads more like a breadcrumb trail for future installments to circle back to. It’s ironic to expect more from a director that’s already synonymous with maximalism. Beneath all its spectacle, though, the Rebel Moon universe could do with a bit more context. If Snyder has his way, A Child of Fire and The Scargiver will not be the last we see of this realm. A graphic novel is already in the works, as is a podcast and video game. The filmmaker’s enthusiasm is well-documented, but he doesn’t always get the chance to flesh out his vision to completion. (To say nothing of the SnyderVerse, Netflix’s Army of the Dead universe is similarly stalled.) If there’s one Snyder franchise that deserves a follow-up, though, it’s this. Sprawling sci-fi fantasy is already a dying breed, but Rebel Moon could be the antidote — if only it has a bit more time to develop.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2023"," In 1980, Roger Corman decided to draft off on the massive popularity of Star Wars by producing his own sci-fi epic. He cobbled together a couple million bucks and some recognizable actors and made Battle Beyond the Stars. Since George Lucas drew inspiration for his movie from Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress, Corman’s team turned their knockoff of Lucas into a knockoff of Kurosawa as well. But instead of The Hidden Fortress, Battle Beyond the Stars took its cues from Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai. Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire is Battle Beyond the Stars on a Star Wars budget. (Netflix spent a reported $160+ million on the project, which consists of one four-hour movie split into two parts.) Snyder supposedly conceived it as a pitch for his own Star Wars movie; when that didn’t pan out, he reworked Rebel Moon as its own sci-fi fantasy story. However he hatched the idea, he also blatantly copied the plot of Seven Samurai — or at least the first half of it — for A Child of Fire, which follows a brave woman from a backwater planet as she assembles a team of warriors to defend her home from the menacing forces of the “Motherworld.” A Child of Fire runs a little over two hours and absolutely plays like the very long first act of a larger story; the whole thing consists of a convoluted fetch quest to gather these heroes one by one. Each hails from a different moon or space colony with its own distinct aesthetic. One looks like a full-on Kurosawa film; the next mimics a dusty frontier Western; another apes the cyberpunk grunge of Blade Runner, and so on. Snyder’s craft is evident all these otherworldly locales and their peculiar denizens. (He served as his own cinematographer, and did a pretty good job of it.) The Blade Runner planet introduces a space ronin named Nemesis (Doona Bae) as she does battle with an enormous spider woman (Jena Malone) who uses her spindly legs as massive stabbing weapons — a nightmarish concept that’s very effectively executed. Nemesis and the rest of the mercenaries’ main adversary is a space Nazi named Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who relaxes between bouts of interplanetary genocide by recharging his body via Cronenbergian ports scattered around his torso. Hoses connected to a big receptacle pour some sort of restorative goop into his muscular frame, another really striking sci-fi image. The constant changes in location, along with all this interesting character and production design, means Rebel Moon is never boring to look at. It’s everything else in Rebel Moon that’s boring. The characters are all generic stock types from other stuff: The mysteriously endowed hero who fell out of the sky (Sofia Boutella’s Kora); the fallen general searching for redemption (Djimon Hounsou’s Titus); the charming smuggler with a heart of gold (Charlie Hunnam), and so on. The actors all look great but bring nothing new or memorable to the table. And just when Kora puts her magnificent seven together, the film abruptly stops. There are brief flashes of excitement, but Rebel Moon’s pacing is really rough; during the introduction of Kora’s farming colony, there’s a walk-and-talk conversation about grain harvests between Noble and the colony’s leader (Corey Stoll) that feels like it goes on for at least 10 minutes. Do they have a surplus? Do they not have a surplus? When will the harvest be ready? Will they give the Motherworld the surplus? It’s kind of surprising the harvest isn’t done by the end of this endless scene. The story takes so many digressions, and adds a lot of characters who seem superfluous; presumably some of these elements will feel more important after Rebel Moon — Part Two next year. For now, you just have to take it on faith that the oddly sympathetic Imperial robot Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) is hanging around for a reason, because he’s really not in this one. And even with all the pauses for flashbacks to Kora’s tragic backstory, we still don’t know her full motivations for taking up this unwinnable fight after more than two hours of movie. Again; this will all surely be explained in the second film. But as its own separate experience, Rebel Moon — Part One is deeply unsatisfying. For that reason, if you are interested in it, I think it may be worth waiting until the second film premieres on Netflix in April and you can watch them both as one big marathon viewing. Any time Snyder ratchets things up into action mode, he immediately ratchets things back down with his now-signature use of relentless slow-motion. As with the rest of Rebel Moon, the results are visually impeccable and dramatically stilted. If you are really into considering the abstract beauty of a clump of sand pinwheeling through the air for 10 seconds, you’ll get all you could possibly want out of this picture. (That happens several times.) If what you prefer in an action setpiece is kinetic excitement or investment in the characters and their goals, this is really not that kind of movie. Instead, Rebel Moon is the kind of movie that seems overwrought and underbaked all at once. So much care has been given to the style and the design of every little element of the sets, the costumes, and the props; yet so little concern has been given to populating all those background elements with fleshed-out human beings with lives that feel like they exist beyond the edges of Snyder’s immaculately composed frames. (The inevitable Art of Rebel Moon book with all of Snyder’s concept sketches and storyboards will probably be a more satisfying experience than the film itself.) While I saw Rebel Moon projected in 70mm on a print that had the muted colors and soft details of a print that had been sitting in storage for decades — as if it was a forgotten blockbuster that had been unearthed and re-released — it may actually play better on Netflix. At home, you can half-watch the legitimately impressive visuals while doing chores or looking at your phone. In that context, the fact that the story is cobbled together from countless earlier movies might actually be a plus. If you’ve seen the films Rebel Moon mimics, you’ll be able to follow what’s happening without taking your attention away from folding laundry. -Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire is not only an unwieldy title, it’s kind of vague. Who is the “Child of Fire”? I assume Kora, but no one ever refers to her that way — although someone does call her “The Scargiver” (the subtitle of Rebel Moon — Part Two) and at one point she refers to herself as “a child of war.” Did Netflix’s algorithm decide that viewers don’t like war movies and recommend a more flowery alternative? -By the way: Battle Beyond the Stars kind of outperforms its craven origins, thanks in large part to a script by John Sayles and special effects by an enterprising young filmmaker by the name of James Cameron. It’s currently on Peacock; you may want to check it out.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023"," Having shepherded the DC Extended Universe, film-maker Zack Snyder sets his sights on a galaxy far, far away with this CGI-heavy mash-up of Star Wars and The Magnificent Seven. A tyrannical empire, an invincible henchman, his ominously powerful master and determined rebel resistance are just some of the none-too-subtle nods to George Lucas's seminal space opera. Sofia Boutella stars as the enigmatic Kora, who is enjoying the rural life on a distant moon until a brutal imperial incursion impels her to recruit a band of warriors, including a Conan-like monster-whisperer, a cyborg swordmaster and a roguish smuggler (Charlie Hunnam). Although suitably epic in scale, the abundance of exposition and slo-mo action scenes drags the story down. The cast do their best in the circumstances, not least Ed Skrein (Deadpool), who has a ball as gleefully lethal enforcer (and ironically named) Atticus Noble. The story continues in Part Two: The Scargiver.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023"," I’ll admit to having a soft spot for Zack Snyder. I’m not sure I’d go so far as to call him a good director, but he is an interesting one, and in the world of big budget genre blockbusters, those are in short supply. Snyder has an undeniable style, defined by a love of slow motion violence, golden hour photography, and godlike heroes with dirt and blood under their nails. As video essayist Patrick Willems explored to great comic effect in 2022, Zack Snyder’s aesthetic is extrapolated almost entirely from Frank Frazetta paintings and John Boorman’s Excalibur. Above all else, Snyder aspires to radness, an aim that he pursues with a charming sincerity. For the past decade, however, that sincerity has been undercut by the cynical business of franchise-building, and the scale of his stories has steadily outgrown audience’s patience for them. His latest effort is a space fantasy epic which he hopes will become “a massive IP and a universe to be built out.” But, like so many aspiring myth-makers, Snyder has put the cart before the horse, promising a sprawling galaxy of stories while failing to make the first one functional in its own right. Not only is Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire a pale imitation of the George Lucas and Akira Kurosawa films that inspired it, but it’s a structurally unsound mess that fails to inspire any excitement for its planned second half, let alone the trilogy that’s supposed to follow. It’s a blunder of Hobbit proportions.  REBEL MOON — PART ONE: A CHILD OF FIRE ★ (1/4 stars)
Directed by: Zack Snyder
Written by: Zack Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, Shay Hatten
Starring: Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman, Djimon Hounsou, Doona Bae, Ray Fisher, Cleopatra Coleman, Jena Malone, Ed Skrein, Fra Fee, Anthony Hopkins
Running time: 133 mins. The elevator pitch for Rebel Moon could not be simpler: It’s Seven Samurai meets Dune — which is to say, Star Wars minus the Flash Gordon whimsy. Sofia Boutella stars as Kora, a former elite soldier of the fascistic Motherworld who has chosen a quiet life on the farming planet of Veldt. But when the sinister Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) demands that her village hand over nearly their entire harvest to feed his troops, Kora and fellow farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, who bears a startling resemblance to Snyder himself) take to space and assemble a group of warriors to repel the invaders. All the stock characters are here: We’ve got a roguish thief (Charlie Hunnam), a kind-hearted, bare-chested beastmaster (Staz Nair), an honorable swordswoman (Bae Doona), a disgraced general (Djimon Hounsou), and a battle-hardened but idealistic revolutionary (Ray Fisher). The cast functions like the party in a bad video game RPG: Each member of the team gets their own little episode in which to establish their methods and motivations, but once they’ve been “unlocked,” their stories are essentially over. They barely interact with each other or the main character, and we learn almost nothing new about them after they debut. Some of them get action beats in the finale, but not all of them, as somehow Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus manages to make it to the end of the film without ever doing anything at all. Perhaps his character’s contributions to the story are all in next year’s Part Two: Scargiver, or awaiting release in the forthcoming three-hour, R-rated Director’s Cut. The galaxy of Rebel Moon, which is presumably the product that’s being advertised here, is mostly boring and derivative. The story takes Kora and company to planet after planet, never staying long enough for any of them to develop an identity beyond “farming planet, mining planet, trading post.” There’s a variety of practically-achieved humanoid aliens, but only a few of their designs are distinctive or memorable, and none of them belong to principal characters. The soldiers of the villainous Motherworld are brutal, cartoonishly evil bullies in Roman-inspired armor and Nazi-ish officer’s uniforms, while the resistance against them look like futuristic Braveheart cosplayers (though Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman both look pretty cool wearing it). There are a handful of interesting non-human aliens that make brief appearances and whose visual weirdness is allowed to speak for itself, but these are pops of imagination in a sea of blandness. Kora’s flashbacks to wartime offer the occasional eye-catching battlefield tableau, but this is little more than an opportunity to admire some quality concept art. Most damning of all, while the characters dart between planets on a spaceship, none of the action takes place in space, which is like having a pirate adventure where nothing happens at sea. The only thing cutting through the blandness is Zack Snyder’s signature look, which is a far cry from the crisp, evenly-lit, smartphone-friendly Netflix house style. Snyder likes a shallow depth of field, a softening of focus on the edge of the frame, and a whole lot of slow motion, but he employs these devices so liberally that they lose any meaning. While speed ramping gives the action of Rebel Moon some flavor, most of the battle sequences aren’t exciting, nor are Snyder’s camera placements. Snyder’s less savory narrative signatures, such as a preference for lore over story and a habit of using sexual violence to heighten the stakes, are also on embarrassing display here. But what’s most frustrating about Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire is its awkward non-ending. This year’s seen more than its share of “half-movies,” but despite ending on cliffhangers, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse and Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning each have a third act and a grand finale that sets up the next chapter. A Child of Fire closes with a sizable action sequence, but action alone doesn’t make a climax. It’s not surprising that the confrontation promised at the start of the film must be reserved for Part Two, but when the credits roll on Part One, nothing has been accomplished beyond a lot of exposition. Aside from Kora and Gunnar’s initial refusal of the call to action, none of the characters have undergone any sort of change. There’s been 133 minutes of plot, background, and action, and yet nothing has happened. Perhaps the two combined parts (in their full, bloody, uncut forms) will miraculously cohere into a watchable film. But as it stands, Rebel Moon has suffered a complete failure to launch.

"Dec 19, 2023"," Zack Snyder decidió dar el salto a Netflix tras todos los problemas que tuvo con Warner. Es cierto que sus fans siguen insistiendo en que el cineasta acaba su visión del DCEU, pero está claro que ha pasado página del cine de superhéroes y ha decidido centrarse en otros proyectos. Hace un par de años fue el turno de la notable 'Ejército de los muertos' y ahora contraataca con 'Rebel Moon', una película cuyo germen está en un proyecto nunca realizado de Star Wars pero que a la hora de la verdad recuerda más a 'Los siete samuráis', el aclamado largometraje de Akira Kurosawa estrenado en 1954. 'Rebel Moon' llega además por partes, ya que Netflix va a estrenar la Parte 1 este viernes 22 de diciembre, pero el 19 de abril nos llegará su secuela directa. Además, Snyder ya ha dejado claro que lanzará en breve un montaje extendido de 'La niña del fuego'. Es posible que allí haya una mejora sustancial respecto a lo que todos podremos ver dentro de apenas unos días, pues esa versión inicial puede que no sea el enorme desastre que anticipaban sus primeras críticas, pero también se queda bastante lejos de ser una buena película de ciencia ficción. Es verdad que la gran mayoría de películas que se estrenan no dejan de reciclar con mayor o menor fortuna historias que ya se han contado en otras ocasiones, pero lo realmente molesto es cuando te queda la sensación de estar viendo poco más que un refrito de ideas ajenas. Eso es justamente lo que sucede en el caso de 'Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego', con el añadido de que en todo momento se toma demasiado en serio a sí misma. Ningún problema con la solemnidad y los aires de grandeza por sí mismos, pero hay que aportar algo más que grandilocuencia visual para evitar que puede ser algo que se le atragante al espectador. Y es que es evidente que Snyder no iba a decepcionar en el apartado visual, pues siempre ha sido uno de los puntos fuertes de su cine. Aquí resulta apabullante desde la primera aparición del personaje interpretado por Sofia Boutella y su estilo característico se percibe en todo momento, especialmente cuando recurre al uso del ralenti en multitud de escenas de acción para intentar introducir un toque adicional de épica. Por ahí quizá la pega esté en que hay situaciones que deberían ser impresionantes y acaban siendo un poco feas, en parte por los diseños utilizados y en parte por algún detalle de montaje de Dody Dorn. Eso sí, lo habitual es intentar avasallar al espectador con una sobredosis de estímulos y que sea lo que funcione como principal reclamo, y justo es reconocer que funciona hasta cierto punto para dar más fuerza a lo que no deja de ser una introducción de más de dos horas en esta galaxia muy muy lejana que presenta aquí el director de 'Amanecer de los muertos'. Aunque a veces sea más aparatoso que realmente espectacular, lo que realmente falla en el caso de 'Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego' está en otra parte. Los guiones de las películas de Snyder suelen estar plagados de ideas muy ambiciosas ejecutadas de forma mejorable. Eso resulta especialmente evidente en el caso que nos ocupa, ya que la película tiene varios momentos en los que la exposición impera por encima del resto y Snyder se empeña en explicarnos en lugar de mostrarnos, provocando así ciertos apagones narrativos que además lastran de forma irremediable todo el trabajo de construcción de personajes, donde es Boutella quien mejor sabe manejarse con un material bastante flojo -y esa especie de Han Solo de Charlie Hunnam tampoco está mal-. Ahí justo es destacar que el arranque puede sonar a mil veces visto -y en todo momento no podría ser más obvio qué es lo que va a suceder-, pero Snyder logra darle la suficiente fuerza para que la amenaza que representa el personaje de Ed Skrein deje con ganas de ver cómo Kora (Boutella) hace todo lo que esté en su mano para neutralizarla. Luego la película se convierte ya por completo en lo que uno podría imaginar que sería hacer una versión de 'Los siete samuráis' ambientada en el universo de Star Wars -estoy convencido de que a Snyder le habría encantado con un Texto de Apertura al estilo de los de la saga creada por George Lucas, pero como es demasiado cantoso opta por la voz en off de Anthony Hopkins-. Claro que hay otras influencias -seguro que no soy el único que acaba viendo al personaje de Staz Nair como una versión bastante endeble de Conan-, pero aquí lo que impera es la estética, prestando especial atención a detalles que deberían enriquecer la función en lugar de convertirse en su única razón de ser. Sí es verdad que se busca cierta sensación de variedad con la visita a diferentes planetas y el reclutamiento de nuevos aliados, pero todo se siente superficial, como si fuera poco más que un truco para reincidir en la misma idea de que la redención funciona como principal eje dramático, pero sin que hasta ahora sus personajes tengan una oportunidad real de lograrla. Como decía antes, estamos ante una introducción de más de horas que al mismo tiempo resulta fatigosa y poco elaborada. Todo ello además aliñado con un cóctel extraño y que pedía a gritos quizá no una apuesta por lo cómico, pero sí una cierta ligereza para extraer más de aquí. Por ejemplo, el villano interpretado por Skrein roza la caricatura en todo momento, pero al final simplemente acaba reducido una encarnación esquemática del mal puro, aunque no tanto como ese grupo de soldados que deja en el planeta de Kora para mantener vigilados a los granjeros. La sensación de que queda al final es que todos ellos -y aquí pienso también en esa alienígena con mucho deseo sexual o esa madre araña- están ahí simplemente para intentar meter alguna escena chula de acción para mantener el interés del espectador. Y alguna está cerca de serlo. Lo que queda al final en 'Rebel Moon Parte 1: La niña del fuego' es un amasijo de ideas cogidas de otros sitios y pasadas por el filtro del cine de Snyder. No me cabe duda de que habrá espectadores que acaben encantados de la vida con lo que se les ofrece aquí, pero para mí es uno de los peores trabajos de un director que cada vez tengo más claro que nunca va a lograr superar a su estupenda ópera prima. Con todo, no llega a hacerse realmente pesada y queda la sensación de que lo mejor está por llegar. El problema es que superar lo que hemos podido ver aquí no es demasiado difícil.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2023","Snyder’s been doing his own cinematography lately, but unlike the comparatively lively “Army of the Dead,” here it just compounds his tendency to make scenes look terribly murky.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023"," It had been my sincere hope — one might even call it A New Hope — that, after watching Rebel Moon: Part 1 - A Child of Fire on its opening day at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto, I would be compelled to rush home and tell you it had be seen in 70 mm on the big screen, and that you had only six days left to do that before it moved to Netflix. Alas, I can’t in good faith suggest you plunk down cinema-ticket prices for this well-intentioned but ultimately spineless Star Wars knockoff. I can barely even recommend it on the streaming service, unless you’re already a subscriber, have two-and-a-quarter hours to kill, and want to see how writer-director (and for some reason cinematographer) Zack Snyder shakes up the pieces of George Lucas’s space opera and lets them fall in a slightly new arrangement. Let’s start at the beginning, with a prologue that, while narrated by Anthony Hopkins, could have been written out on a scroll and unspooled among the stars. It’s an exposition dump about a galactic empire in turmoil after the death of its king, and a rebellion brewing in distant colonial corners against the brutal rule of the Motherworld. On one such rock we meet Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former soldier now working as a farmer on a simple agrarian planet that, for unknown reasons, uses almost no technology except those sliding doors so favoured by futuristic societies. When Kora’s home is visited by a deputation from the Motherworld, intent on rooting out rebels and also taking all their crops, she decides to gather a mercenary force to help save them. In short order she touches down on a variety of planets and collects a ragtag collective of fighters that includes fellow farmer Gunnar (Michael Huisman), pilot and smuggler Han Solo (Charlie Hunnam), shirtless nobleman and dragon-tamer Tarak (Staz Nair), assassin extraordinaire Nemesis (Doona Bae), former Imperium general Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and the BloodAxe siblings, leaders of the rebellion, played by Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman. Their chief adversary? That would be Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble, whom I took to calling Admiral Cudgel because his weapon of choice is a big stick, though one he wields to great effect. Kora’s fighting style, meanwhile, takes place at two speeds — slow motion and even slower motion, the better for the film to revel in her bad-assery. Rebel Moon isn’t a terrible movie, but it pales in every comparison to the Star Wars universe. And it courts that comparison at every turn, thanks to how much of that movie’s blood seems to run in its veins. There are laser swords, an intergalactic watering hole frequented by space pilots, and even a British robot, voiced by Hopkins once he’s done reading the opening narration. The forces of the Imperium, meanwhile, are equal parts 21st-century Marines — bulky carry-everything clothes made of kevlar and grit — and 20th-century Nazis, what with the high collars, shiny boots, and a predilection for little gold lapel pins. Snyder has made a lot of noise about his world-building ambitions, but world-borrowing might be closer to the mark. It does occasionally match Star Wars for risibility of dialogue, as in the scene in which Kora spells out her entire life story to another character, concluding: “I’m only telling you this so you know who I am.” My son and I have now added “I’m only telling you this ...” to our list of stock bad-movie line openings, alongside “I made your favourite” and “As we both know...” And like another famous space opera, this one will Strike Back in April with Rebel Moon: Part 2 - the Scargiver, and then Return sometime after that with a planned part three. Snyder has suggested he may make even more sequels after that. Do I believe him? Let’s just say I’ve got a bad feeling about this. Rebel Moon: Part 1 - A Child of Fire. Directed by Zack Snyder. Starring Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, and Ed Skrein. Plays one week in 70 mm at Toronto’s TIFF Bell Lightbox, then from Dec. 21 on Netflix.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023"," Director Zack Snyder’s latest film, Rebel Moon, started life as a pitch to Lucasfilm – essentially, what if you combined Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai with Star Wars? The partnership wasn’t to be and after years of development, the project morphed into what it is today at Netflix. Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is a derivative space opera that indulges in Snyder’s worst maximalist impulses. It is a sensory assault, a punitive experience that can be summed up in one word: Loud. It’s like being pummelled, visually and aurally. There is no reprieve, no moment to breathe – maybe Rebel Moon is hoping that if it doesn’t let up, you won’t notice that it has the shallowest of characterisations. On the plus side, if you ever wanted to see both of Game of Thrones’ Daario Naharis-es fight each other, you’ll get that very specific wish. Ed Skrein (who played the role in GoT season three) and Michiel Huisman (seasons four to six) are in this movie and share scenes. The recognisable plot is as follows. There’s a distant galaxy with humans and alien creatures, all ruled by a central, fascistic government that uses a brutal military to enforce its will. The tyrant-in-chief, Regent Balisarius (Fra Free), prefers to don black and a permanent scowl while his forces fly through the galaxy in fearsome space stations that have planet-razing weapons. But there are challenges to the power of the Empire, sorry, Imperium. Insurgents mount small campaigns but the Imperium will not brook even minor victories against its forces, so an armada is led by military commander Atticus Noble (Skrein), charged with hunting down a brother (Ray Fisher) and sister (Cleopatra Coleman) who have been wreaking havoc. During his mission, Atticus lands on an outskirt moon and demands a small agrarian community give his troops the food that is necessary to keep the farmers alive. His threat to destroy them is real and he leaves a contingent of sadistic, would-be-rapists soldiers behind to ensure this happens. Among this colony is Kora (Sofia Boutella), a young woman with a mysterious past who is weirdly very adept with weapons and murder. She and Gunnar (Huisman), the “simple farmer” who is patronised as such roughly seven times, take off on a mission to locate some allies who can help defend the farmers from the cruel Atticus. They hop around from world to world, collecting fighters with an equally motivating grudge against the Imperium – Nemesis (Doona Bae), a swordmaster, Tarak (Staz Nair), a warrior so oiled up he makes the Tongan Olympics team seem mattified, Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a slippery mercenary with an even slipperier Irish brogue, and Titus (Dijmon Hounsou), a former general who once led a mutiny. Some of the fight sequences are tightly edited and stylish to the point they look like they could be a comic book splash page – that’s the stuff Snyder does really well. And there is occasionally a mournful, velvety score when Rebel Moon isn’t too busy landing blows with its discordant, metallic sound design. But the writing is so terrible. It never misses an opportunity to tell not show, packed with exposition. Early on, Kora tells you all her psychological damage as if she needs to prove she has gained enough personal clarity to graduate from therapy. The villains are nothing more than caricature. And the movie falls into that antiquated trap of using sexual violence as a shortcut for jeopardy. Can we please not do that anymore in 2023? It’s lazy and gross. Snyder has a legion of dedicated fanboys and apologists and many will revel in the ultra violence of his action scenes and the extremity of everything else. As a filmmaker, while he has always leant towards earnestness, he has also proven he knows how to have some fun such as in the extravagant zombie gore-fest Army of the Dead. But Rebel Moon is not fun. Not even a bit. But if you’re a glutton for punishment and want even more not fun, Snyder has promised a longer, bloodier extended cut will come in 2024. And, of course, there’s still the sequel.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023",It begins to feel like a pastiche of [Zack Snyder's] own greatest hits... Like an R-rated Star Wars film drained of all its humanity.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023"," ★☆☆☆☆Never before, on planet cinema, has so much slow-mo been wasted on so many characters for whom we care so little. This mind-numbingly dull sci-fi ensemble from Justice League’s Zack Snyder boasts a hefty running time (134 minutes) that might’ve been shortened considerably, possibly even halved, had the protagonists therein not been forced to run, walk, jump, turn, stand, sit down, flick their flowing fringes and flex their oily pecs at a speed that comes, at times, perilously close to one long, long, freeze frame. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2023"," Whatever side of the Zack Snyder fence you’re on — and if you straddle the fence, prepare to get pushed, one way or the other — Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire is exactly what you think it is. For fans of the director, it’s an unfiltered space fantasy full of the director’s “mature” content, slo-mo, extremely shallow focus (literally), and stylistic excess. For haters of Snyder, the same. This is space opera with a capital “O” — there’s no key moment Snyder won’t punctuate with slo-mo, no emotional beat he won’t enhance with an ear-assaulting choral soundtrack. Characters speak in broad proclamations as if to get as far from Joss Whedon’s sensibility as possible. The script has no jokes and very little humor aside from that which may be taken from the overall excess and over-the-top nature of the thing. How you react to this may vary. It took some years, but Michael Bay hung in there long enough to see his “Bayhem” go from being the bane of film critics’ existence to a stylistic tic they now want to see more of sometimes. Snyder’s not there yet, in part because of vitriolic spambots and online trolls determined to exacerbate any distance between the director’s critics and fans. To those who do appreciate his work, however, Rebel Moon feels like the logical culmination of everything he’s done so far. It’s an actual Snyderverse that operates entirely under Zack Snyder laws of physics and adolescent-sensibility badassery.  Some comics allow the reader to easily imagine them as movies; Rebel Moon is the first to make me imagine the comic adaptation: where the captions would go, when the artwork would become more stylized, what the splash pages would be, and so forth. Thanks to Snyder’s familiar stop-and-go, slow-down-speed-up action scenes, it frequently feels exactly like a motion comic. Comparisons to Star Wars are obvious, but it also feels like Sucker Punch in space, except that Snyder, and not his protagonist, is the one imagining it…as his escape from the torture of online discourse, perhaps. Like 1980’s Battle Beyond the Stars, itself a Star Wars cash-in by Roger Corman, it’s The Seven Samurai in space, but after 43 years, I think it’s okay to allow another one to exist. As if it’s a competition for directorial excess, Snyder attempts to smack down several obvious rivals by one-upping their most irritating tics. The use of lens flares in the first act is eye-melting and makes J.J. Abrams look like a goth kid by comparison; his sound mixes, rendering dialogue inaudible, give Christopher Nolan a major run for the money, though perhaps pointlessly, since this is a Netflix movie and closed captioning is right there. We must await with bated breath the extra-hour-long R-rated cut, which promises [per Snyder at a post-screening Q&A] envelope-pushing perversity; for now, the story, such as it is, doesn’t feel like it’s missing chunks. Indeed, the story as a concept begins to feel almost irrelevant here; Rebel Moon verges on an art film in the way it primarily uses motion, color, and the objectification of its actors to propel the narrative. Where it’s less of an art film is in its message, which boils down to “fascism is bad” and “appeasement doesn’t work.” Granted, there are plenty of public figures in our world who could stand to have a message that basic drummed into their heads, but like Rob Zombie, Zack Snyder is more interested in making cool imagery than analyzing its undertones. Without seeing the full story, judging the themes is harder. We can nonetheless judge the coolness factor, which is probably off the charts for 14-year-olds and still pretty decent if you’re the kind of adult who still loves Heavy Metal magazine. On a planet that’s basically agrarian, pre-Christian Ireland — they celebrate the harvest by having traditionally mandated sex, rather than praying — representatives from the Motherworld show up in conspicuously Nazi-like regalia, led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein). This is the movie’s notion of irony: giving a scummy villain a name derived from a famously positive literary character and his primary adjective.  Noble is essentially Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds, and when his uncannily calm conversation inevitably devolves into violence, he leaves Planet Ireland with an ultimatum. They’d better give him the majority of their crops by his deadline…Or Else. Most of the locals decide that if they do really good work harvesting, Noble might be impressed and spare them. But Kora (Sofia Boutella) knows better. The reason she knows better is she’s actually Gamora to Noble’s Thanos: a forcibly adopted daughter raised to kill who changed her mind and went on the run. Looking to hide again, she can’t help herself from taking out some of the occupying troops when they threaten to rape a local girl, and once she lays waste to the creeps, there’s really no choice but to prepare for war. If you know the inspiration, you know what happens next: Kora must go looking for mercenaries and other rebels to join her fight and take on the Empire, er, Imperium. The team she assembles includes Belfast Han Solo (Charlie Hunnam), Totally Not Female Cad Bane With Lightsabers (Doona Bae), General Drunk Maximus (Djimon Hounsou), Local Dork (Michiel Huisman), Noble Indigenous Animal Whisperer (Staz Nair), and the Kickass Dreadlocked Siblings (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman). The Anthony Hopkins-voiced Threepio With Antlers is peripheral thus far, though he appears to be on a saga-length quest to deprogram his own pacifism. Lengthy flashbacks explain Kora’s past; for the rest, we’ll have to wait for part 2. Yes, they have names, but they’re all names like “Balisarius,” and in some cases, they have alternate names, and half the time, what characters say is inaudible anyway. This is what action figure packages are for. Snyder’s sensibility here feels a lot like Rob Liefeld’s in comics — everyone has to have the biggest muscles, most lovingly preposterous weapons, and coolest poses. The story is strictly a secondary concern, aside from the mandate that the PG-13 envelope must be pushed with as much blood and fetish material as the rating will allow. This may sound like an insult, but it really isn’t. Sure, this style would work wonders with a really good script, but that feels like complaining that ballets have predictable plots. To the extent that the story surprises, it’s with images, not narrative twists. Snyder may not have a message he’s trying to impart with all his visual poetry, but he offers up a field day for analysts in what he throws up out of his id. For one thing, he has apparently always wondered whether or not Walrus Man wanted to have sex with Luke Skywalker in the Tatooine cantina. Like Beau Is Afraid and Babylon, Rebel Moon is a big swing of a film that feels like everything its director ever wanted to do, and every filmmaker should get at least one shot at that. Snyder’s best movies use other people’s stories to cover his relative lack of interest in narrative, but there’s something to be said for letting him go nuts and losing yourself in the madness. Luke Y. Thompson has been a professional film critic since 1999, and part of the toy blogging community since the aughts. He was the first blogger to cover Comic-Con panel by panel for a major trade publication, and has several LA Press Club awards and honorable mentions, including one for reviewing fast food.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2023","  Decades in the making, Zack Snyder's long-awaited space opera Rebel Moon has finally been released. What originated as a darker pitch to bring new life to theStar Wars franchise and brought to life during the golden age of dystopian sci-fi dramas, the Netflix production Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire brings to life a world and story that at first feels quite familiar but soon proves far deeper and grander than its own format allows for.   After the royal family is killed at the princess's coronation, the Motherworld military assumes power as regent and begins laying waste to the interstellar kingdom, locking horns with the rebel factions led by the heroic Bloodaxe siblings. On the idyllic farming village on the moon, Veldt, the troubled and isolated Kora finds her chance at a new life vanquished when the Motherworld's forces, led by a figure from her past, invade. With only nine weeks to save Veldt, Kora teams up with the naive but grounded farmer Gunnar to track down the most fearsome warriors in space, recruit the Bloodaxes, and discover just how heroic she can be.   Zack Snyder is a polarizing name in the film industry. Boasting his own cinematic language, building on and popularizing certain film-making techniques and trends, and directing many impressive big-budget blockbuster films, like the iconic 300 and his recent takes on the DC Cinematic Universe, Snyder is one of the most prominent directors in contemporary film.   Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire feels like a product of the late 2010s and the pandemic era -- a highly cynical era of political unrest and collective unease when franchises such as Game of Thrones, Hunger Games, and similar dystopian narratives thrived. Snyder utilized many of the old chestnuts of 2010s and early 2020s fiction -- a hardened, cynical lead, a totalitarian government terrorizing a helpless populace, explosive sound design with a Hans Zimmerman-style soundtrack, monochromatic settings drained by inadequate lighting, and a cast of angsty characters. At first glance, it would be easy to dismiss Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire as derivative, outdated, and generic. However, on closer inspection, this film is much deeper than its runtime or format first suggests.   Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire does indeed tap into the tone, tropes, and mythos popularized by Star Wars and Game of Thrones -- even casting actors from the latter, Michiel Huisman and Ed Skrein, both of whom had a turn at portraying the knight Daario Naharis. However, many familiar character archetypes are deconstructed and rebuilt into something different. The so-called barbarian warrior Tarak turns out to be the most eloquent and gentle of the recruits; the fearsome and mythical General Titus is a washed-up and shell-shocked veteran battered by gladiator fights and guilt; the monster-slaying swordswoman Nemesis lives in urban sprawl and has little pride in her work; Kai, a mercenary pilot with no allegiances, is a classic Han Solo-type rogue whose morally ambiguous philosophy is taken to its logical conclusion. The legendary resistance leaders, the Bloodaxe siblings, immediately begin to subvert their mythical status and reveal their interpersonal conflicts and inner vulnerabilities, both on and off the battlefield. The breakout character, Jimmy the mechanical, robotic knight, is the most strikingly human character in the cast.   Sofia Boutella's Kora is a send-up of the contemporary dark fantasy protagonist. At first, she appears as the hardened victim archetype who reluctantly rises to the occasion to demonstrate her humanity. However, through a series of flashbacks -- all of which could have served as their own film -- this archetype is subverted, revealing a greater depth to her character and the overall narrative, inverting the victim into a villain and back into a hero. Boutella's performance reflects the audience's shifting perception of the character, defrosting into something more nuanced, if still quite hard and gritty, befitting the dystopian sci-fi setting.   With such classic archetypes to sink their teeth into, it's no wonder that the cast is giving their all in their performances. Ed Skrein, in particular, clearly revels in playing the over-the-top evil role of the vicious and smarmy Admiral Atticus Noble, boasting a smug, smiling bloodlust and the evilest, sharpest cheekbones since Indiana Jones' Colonel Dietrich. His chemistry with Boutella's Kora is palpable, especially in their climactic confrontation.   One performance stands out in this cast. The most memorable character is that of Michiel Huisman's Gunnar, a simple yet noble farmer whose singular act of rebellion sparks the series of events. In a movie crammed with familiar archetypes, Gunnar stands out as the most common archetype of all, the ""everyman,"" acting as the grounded center for this sweeping story and as the audience surrogate. His ordinariness is precisely what makes his character so likable and memorable, elevating Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire into one of Snyder's more hopeful and optimistic stories.   Perhaps the biggest strike against Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire is its structure. A grand-scale story such as this, with many characters to develop, so much lore to build on, and worlds to explore, feels tied down by the two-hour, two-part film format. This story might have been stronger as a miniseries, devoting more time to introducing and developing each rebel. Many of the characters' introductions could have easily been their own episodes, fleshing out their backstories and personalities more. It's especially unfortunate, given the amount of details and depth each of the different worlds is given. Entire episodes could have been devoted to exploring these environments. General Titus' Roman-inspired, Colosseum-like world and Nemesis's industrial cityscape deserved an extra few minutes of screen time at least.   The format also hurts the action and characterization. Doona Bae's memorable fight with a spider-suited Jena Malone is worth its own film. Considering that the actors are so invested in their characters, it's a shame that they aren't given more time. As it is, Snyder's vast world has been crammed into a small box, leaving viewers paradoxically overwhelmed and wanting more.   Some standout characters, introduced in the first quarter of this film, are unceremoniously dropped out of focus. Among them are Charlotte Maggi as the kindhearted peasant girl Sam, the mechanical Knight Jimmy, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, a gentle and sympathetic character revealed to be an honorable hero in his own right, and Sky Yang as Aris, the one humane soldier of the regent who proves instrumental in the first major fight of the film. These refreshing characters would have been a fun addition to the main cast, potentially bringing a fresh dynamic to the Seven Samurai setup. While the ending promises the prominence of at least some of these characters, their exclusion from the main action is disappointing. That said, their impressive impact on the story and audiences is a testament to the strength of the writing and world-building that bodes well for the April 2024 release of Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver.   Aesthetically, Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire is one of the most visually diverse and impressive of Zack Snyder's films. Snyder's directorial style fares best when he has an exotic world to work with. Snyder's imagination is free to run wild, and his cinematic language is allowed to thrive. His signature sudden slow-motion and dramatic camera movements feel as natural as lasers, spaceships, and armor. If there is one thing Snyder is truly admired for, it's his impeccable fight scenes and choreography, and there is plenty of that to be had in Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire, and the director, cast, and VFX artists have pulled out all the stops.   Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire is especially impressive for its vivid realism. Although the film makes liberal use of CGI -- complete with explosions, monsters, mythical beasts, and swashbuckling spacecraft combat -- the practical effects stand out the most. Actors are transformed into monsters by equal parts computer graphics and prosthetics; the settings are clearly and breathtakingly real. The practical effects add to the gravity and immediacy of the action and characters' interactions. Unfortunately, these beautiful settings and respectable art direction are hampered by subpar, HDR-style lighting, which continues to weigh down much of contemporary cinema. Characters' faces are obscured, complex environments are shrouded in darkness, and space itself feels especially dark.   Perhaps, its impending release to streaming and the upcoming director's cut will provide the full redemption this film and franchise deserves. As it is, Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire is a strong story with a plethora of great characters, expansive worlds, intricate lore, and surprisingly subversive depth, but it is painfully and obviously held back by its short runtime. Luckily, there is still a second part to look forward to, giving Snyder's vision a better chance to grow and thrive.  When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival.

"Dec 18, 2023"," 
Do you like  the Star Wars franchise? How about the new version of Dune? And what about Avatar, The Matrix, Starship Troopers, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones? And also: Westerns, samurai movies, Inglourious Basterds, ancient mythology (Greek, Roman, and a smattering of Eastern), the Dungeons & Dragons monsters’ manual, those old-school Roger Dean album covers, Frank Frazetta’s paintings, Hideo Kojima’s video games, James Fenimore Cooper’s “Leatherstocking Tales,” the collected works of Robert Heinlein and Piers Anthony, and six out of the nine short stories that make up Isaac Asimov’s I, Robot?  
	There’s more, of course, including a spider-like creature, a squid-like regent, a crab-like bot used for interrogating prisoners, some extraterrestrial horses, a wild Griffin, Cary Elwes chewing CGI scenery, a sensitive robot (also voiced by Anthony Hopkins, so maybe he’s the narrator, or not?), and a half-dozen hints of things to come. Snyder has definitely concocted this out of his own imagination and a deep DVD collection, populated by all sorts of creepy-crawlies, familiar archetypes, and a whole lotta cool imagery. What you begin to suspect halfway through Rebel Moon — Part 1: A Child of Fire is that amidst all of this mix-and-match world-building, someone may have forgotten to pay attention to the storytelling aspect. By the end credits, that suspicion has turned to outright fear. That laundry list we namechecked up top may indeed be a collection of a sci-fi/fantasy/genre fanatic’s favorite things. But when you slop all of that into a narrative that’s somehow too basic and too confusing to follow — let’s just say that the sum of all those disparate, beloved parts does not equal anything resembling a whole.

"Dec 18, 2023"," Having already made a sizeable TV mark with popular franchises like “Stranger Things” and “Squid Games,” Netflix obviously wants its own in-house epic “Avatar” or “Dune” sci-fi blockbuster franchise for the cinema (irony not lost here). Having made a home for director Zack Snyder, post-short-lived DC Universe, with “Army Of The Dead,” they’re clearly banking on the filmmaker’s latest effort, “Rebel Moon”—a big blustery and fabulist space opera in the vein of “Star Wars”— and to be the next big thing. Unfortunately, the lifeless and superficial “Rebel Moon” is anything but and direly announces itself as a turgid, dead-on-arrival non-starter right from the jump. Once conceived as a” Star Wars” movie with elements of Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai” and then refashioned back into an “original” sci-fi film, the bare bones of that story remain, minus George Lucas’ touchstone elements (though many of them still here, barely disguised). But “Rebel Moon” is beyond just deeply shallow imitation; it completely lacks inspiring ideas, making for an exceptionally tedious and flat experience despite the broad, ambitious canvas it is drawn on. It reads and feels like a studio cable directed down to exec, “We need epic space opera, stat, green light, easiest ready-to-go option, stat.” All of Snyder’s worst grandiose impulses towards the overwrought, the overblown, and the self-indulgent—see the abysmal “Sucker Punch,” which “Rebel Moon” honestly rivals for the title of his worst movie— are entirely on display at all-time, perhaps trying to cover for a slight, rail-thin threadbare story that fails ever to engage. “Rebel Moon” begins with a “Star Wars”-like crawl, only this time, it’s done in a long-drawn-out narration by Anthony Hopkins, whose solemn voice is perhaps meant to provide gravity to some convoluted backstory about the corrupt government of the Motherworld (clearly a stand-in for the Empire) and some, “wut, huh?” gibberish about the “Imperium” and other long-winded historical events that happened in the past. Perhaps because of so many derivative, previously baked-in Lucasfilm elements substituted for something else, the presumptuous “Rebel Moon” constantly makes the lethal mistake of assuming the audience has an investment in this galaxy far away). From there, it tells an immensely basic and boring story that’s not deeper or more complex than recruiting random good guys to fight bad guys. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a stranger with a mysterious past, is welcomed into a farming community on the Moon of Veldt. Soon, the malevolent Admiral Noble (a one-note of cruelty Ed Skrein) and his army visit this off-world to sniff out rebel forces that have made life difficult for the Motherworld (“Oh no, they’re suddenly here!” everyone essentially moans when an imperious-looking shadowy ship blocks out the sun). Ultimatums are made about delivering grain harvest (zzzz), a military occupancy begins, and soon, Kora and the one kind of brave Veldt farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), go on a mission, ala ‘Seven Samurai’ to enlist other dissidents to join their cause. But monotonous and uninspired in every turn, “Rebel Moon” fails to hook the viewer early, and thus, the longwinded adventure to add new members in the fight against the imminent Motherworld return is exhausting and excruciatingly mind-numbing. “Rebel Moon” feels like a feature-length pitch deck and lavish, colorful storyboard brought to life. It has scale, size, visual grandeur, and spectacular pop-fantasy razzle dazzle on hand (think “Lord Of The Rings” and “Guardians Of The Galaxy” fused with some Frank Herbert), but nothing else. It’s like a visual proof of concept that lacks compelling characters and an engaging story and thus feels shockingly empty and soulless. Netflix clearly gives carte blache, and Synder runs with it, crafting a two-hour mediocrity that can barely justify its runtime and yet still insists to its viewers it warrants a sequel (spoiler: it most certainly does not). A mish-mash hodge-podge of sci-fi tropes, borrowing a little from fantasy movies like “Dune,” on top of its recycled George Lucas ideas, “Rebel Moon” is reminiscent of some of the most throwaway and disposable films of this ilk, bringing to mind, “John Carter Of Mars,” “Terminator Genisys,” “Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets,” and Frank Miller’s “The Spirit,” a similarly visually ambitious, but narratively insipid movie. Snyder’s worst films are always humorless, pretentious, and grim, and this unfortunate propensity is exasperatingly glaring here. There’s no joy, vim, or sense of playful wit that’s so key to many classic blockbusters. Every moment of the self-important, oppressive movie is airless and melodramatic, and the entire cast plays every histrionic scene so painfully pompously and somber (all the incessant trademark Snyder slow-motion and speed-ramping to imbue hyper-violent action moments with weight only exacerbates how sweaty and vacant the entire affair is). There’s all of one joke in the film—a bleak moment where a hero essentially says “good job” when a giant hawk kills its evil master (this entire sequence and tangent are brutally leaden, longwinded, and unnecessary). The film’s arrogant, unearned self-confidence is off the charts and sometimes nearly embarrassing in the way it’s so clearly self-assured in its vision and yet lacks self-awareness about how hollow that vision is. “Rebel Moon” plays out like an interminable trailer for each character it introduces to the fight— Doona Bae plays a cyborg swordfighter who is the obvious stand-in for the “kickass” Jedi that was present in the original script. In that regard, Snyder’s film is essentially just a tiresome collection of “here’s the latest badass” sequence they’ve drafted with almost no convincing rationale ever given as to why they would risk their lives to save some random farming town other than phony do the right thing platitudes and unpersuasive monologue entreaties. Filled with supporting players that don’t do much, Djimon Hounsou, Charlie Hunnam, Staz Nair, Ray Fisher, and Cleopatra Coleman among them, there’s not one stand-out, and no one fares very well with all the ponderous acting and stiff dialogue. “Rebel Moon” is so uninvolving that its conspicuous problems stand out even more. There’s such a mess of disparate, conflicting and incongruous accents even within people supposedly from the same villages (Corey Stoll and Hunnam can’t even seem to get theirs straight from scene to scene). World-building and design-wise, nothing feels congruent either; again, it’s just a jumble of haphazard styles. Whereas “Star War” managed to convincingly create a universe that melded vintage and futuristic elements into one aesthetic and made you believe they could co-exist, “Rebel Moon” fails at exactly this same execution. The farmers look like they’re plucked out of age-old Hobbiton eras with backwood technology, the villains borrow Nazi iconography, and some “Dune” elements are reappropriated. Still, when spaceships and blasters appear, it feels deeply implausible that all these elements cohabitate in the same universe. Politically, despite an evil oppressor at its core, Snyder seems as libertarian/outsider-ish as ever, characters often alluding to being out of step with “both sides” of the ruling forces in this galaxy.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2023"," It’s well known that Rebel Moon was originally conceived as a Star Wars movie. Refurbished and reimagined, it now arrives as a Netflix original. But watching it, it’s clear this isn’t just Zack Snyder’s Star Wars — it’s his The Matrix, his Blade Runner, his Gladiator. It’s Vikings and Nazis and aliens and lightsabers. This is an exercise in throwing absolutely everything at the wall, and seeing what sticks. Unfortunately, little of it does. Sofia Boutella, a seriously underrated action hero, is our anchor. She is Kora, a soldier with a traumatic past, trying to find peace ploughing fields on the planet Veldt. Since the galaxy’s king was killed, it lives under the boot of the Imperium. When they arrive, led by Ed Skrein’s Admiral Noble, Kora is drawn into fighting them off — then gathers a team of notorious warriors to protect Veldt when they return. There’s cheeky smuggler Kai (Charlie Hunnam); permanently topless Tarak (Staz Nair); guilt-ridden badass Nemesis (Bae Doona); and drunk coliseum-dwelling General Titus (Djimon Hounsou). We don’t really know who they are, or why they’d agree to help Kora. It’s hard to care about any of them. Some exciting sci-fi invention is displayed along the way, especially in the character and creature design — see Jena Malone’s vengeful, spider-esque Harmada and the Bloodaxe siblings (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher). But Snyder’s signature slow-motion and lens flare is overbearingly, obfuscatingly present. Slowing to the point of freeze-frame mid-action sequence does, inevitably, create impressive imagery, but it can feel like that image is Snyder’s only aim, rather than developing a story that would make those moments truly connect. The colour palette is largely dull, too, with heavy use of CGI, and visuals that are genuinely blurry at times. It’s clear from the earnest tone, enormous budget and planned expansion of the franchise that Snyder’s intention was to create something mythic. He somewhat succeeds, but only at surface level; there’s certainly a sense of scale, but barely anything underneath. The script is both childish in its overly simplistic morality, and tinged with an adult, nasty sexual edge. There are endless exposition dumps, yet you still don’t really understand the bigger picture. There is a lot of talking about grain. The idea of an entirely new galaxy held such promise; sadly, now, the many Rebel Moon projects ahead (in films, books, graphic novels and games) have a little more to prove.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2023","  For a film that originally was thought of as a subversion of the Star Wars franchise, Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire feels pretty similar to an installment of it. From a lightsaber-like weapon to the narration at the beginning that feels a lot like the opening crawl, it struggles to create its own identity. The worst part is the material has plenty of potential that goes unrealized.   Conceived by Zack Snyder over more than a decade, Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire centers around Kora (Sofia Boutella), a soldier who is relatively content with the life she found for herself amongst the people who live and work in the farming moon of planet Veldt. She used to do dirty work for the Imperium, a ruthless entity that goes around planets subjugating inhabitants to do their bidding. When they finally come to her new home, Kora decides she has no choice but to form a plan to take them on.  When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival.  As fans of Snyder will know, there’s nothing inherently wrong with Rebel Moon, especially when it comes to its visuals. The director has proven time and time again that he knows how to craft an iconic moment. This time, his prowess for doing that is shown right in the early moments of the movie. The first arrival of the enemy ship in Veldt is right up there with how the filmmaker structured the death of the Waynes in Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. The trouble comes in the rest of the film to follow.   When we finally start to get a sense of who Kora is and what moves her, it’s heist movie time and the warrior proceeds to recruit members that we end up not knowing much about except for the weapons they carry. There are some surprises here and there when it comes to their attitudes, but it's all rather run-of-the-mill. The bigger issue is that Rebel Moon seems to not want to make an effort to stand out among similar titles like Rogue One (which is far superior), and one of the reasons might be its runtime.   This version of Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fireis not 100% of the movie that Snyder wanted to show. The R-rated extended cut is yet to come out, and it’s possible to see and feel that pieces are missing in the story – especially when you factor in that there’s also a Part Two supposed to come out in four months. The worst of it is that Rebel Moon goes out of its way to present itself as a PG-13 movie, with violent moments so blatantly cut short that they lose all impact. It makes it extra hard to feel engaged in the movie’s fights.   What also gets neglected in this first cut of Rebel Moon is the worldbuilding that was teased so much by Snyder himself. He obviously came up with several planets and societies that could make the characters as distinct as possible and yet… what defines each of the planets? What can you solidly remember about them after the screening is over? Not by chance, the one that stands out is Veldt – which is the planet we spend more time in and meet the most characters. For the rest, it feels like Snyder thought that populating a planet just requires putting together weird-looking aliens that pop on the screen.   All in all, we can’t ignore the elements that do work in Rebel Moon. That Snyder will commit to delivering top-notch special effects is kind of a given at this point, but it doesn’t mean that we should take it for granted. The costume design, production design, and special effects are efficient in creating a haunting environment when it needs to – particularly when Imperium disciples land on Veldt and other territories.   Ultimately, one of the best sentiments that Rebel Moon evokes is the sense that oppressed people have no choice but to revolt. This is expressed pretty early in the movie when a discussion ends with an unexpected body on the floor. It gets us invested in Kora’s journey, and you do root for her and her team. You’ll just wish you had the chance to know them better.   Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is available to stream on Netflix in the U.S. starting December 21 at 7 p.m. PST/10 p.m. EST.

"Dec 16, 2023"," Once upon a time, Zack Snyder pitched Lucasfilm on a new entry into the Star Wars franchise that he described as “Seven Samurai in space,” a concept which the studio — newly acquired by Disney — ultimately passed on. Having spent the better part of the past decade developing the idea, one might have expected Snyder to have fleshed out the concept beyond that initial logline. But Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, the first installment of Snyder’s “original” sci-fi epic, arrives as a 134-minute slog through endless references, homages and outright thefts, an embarrassingly derivative work that indulges the director’s worst tendencies and lays bare his weaknesses as a storyteller.  On the distant moon of Veldt, a peaceful farming village is thrown into disarray by the sudden arrival of a warship commanded by Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who cheerfully murders village leader Sindri (a woefully miscast Corey Stoll) and promises to return in 10 weeks to claim the upcoming harvest for himself and his troops. Kora (Sofia Boutella), an outsider on the run from the forces of the Motherworld who crash-landed on Veldt several years before, initially plans to flee, but when the detachment of soldiers Noble left behind attempts to rape a local girl — yes, it’s 2023 and we’re still using sexual assault as a plot catalyst — Kora cuts them down. Setting off with harvest overseer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) in tow, Kora vows to recruit warriors who will return to train the villagers how to defend themselves. Does any of this sound familiar? From the opening shot of a star destroyer Dreadnought drifting through space, it feels as though Snyder never made peace with not being asked to join the galaxy far, far away; the plot may crib heavily from Akira Kurosawa’s beloved samurai epic, but it steals borrows just as liberally from George Lucas. If you have to choose one film where the protagonists visit a cantina full of shady alien creatures and hire a scoundrel pilot to ferry them across the galaxy in a rickety smuggling vessel to rendezvous with leaders of a rebellion, you’re better off with the original; Star Wars handled this material much better more than 45 years ago. Characters are merely archetypes — the disgraced general, the mournful assassin, the fallen prince — whose backstories and motivations are divulged through dialogue they typically deliver themselves; at least Kora gets a few action-packed flashbacks to go along with the clunky exposition. “I’m only telling you this so you know who I am.” Snyder’s love for shallow depth of field is on full display here, as is a predilection for lens flare that puts J.J. Abrams’ Star Trek reboot to shame. But it’s the obsession with slow motion and speed ramping that continues to be his most prominent visual flourish, and the director’s increasing reliance on this technique leaves every action sequence feeling bland and uninspired. Seeing the beads of sweat on Kora’s brow or the muzzle flashes from her space-age assault rifle as she charges into battle might be cool once, but more often than not it feels like Snyder is going back to the well because he doesn’t know what else to do. Even diehard fans of the director’s oeuvre — the sort of stalwarts that delight in waging campaigns of harassment toward anyone who doesn’t believe the four-hour cut of Justice League was the greatest film of all time — may find themselves tiring of the gimmick by the time Rebel Moon – Part One mercifully comes to an end.  Being the first installment of a larger narrative, it’s expected that numerous plot threads are left dangling and ready to be tied up when Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver debuts in April 2024. But with shallow characters, a galaxy that feels almost lifeless, a narrative that’s been recycled and remixed from other (better) films, and a directorial style that has barely progressed since 300, what reason do we have to come back for more? Perhaps, now that all the table setting has been completed, the good stuff will arrive in the second half of the story; but I won’t be holding my breath. ",NEGATIVE

Duffy, Charlotte Maggi, Sky Yang, and Staz Nair. When a peaceful settlement on the edge of a distant moon finds itself threatened by the armies of a tyrannical ruling force, a mysterious stranger living among its villagers becomes their best hope for survival. Zack Snyder loves world building, and so Netflix has afforded him the opportunity to play in their subscription dollar sandbox following the end of the [whisper it quietly] DC Snyderverse. Having launched one already in the form of the enjoyably garish Army of the Dead, this time the director shoots for the moon with an ambitious slice of space opera. Derivative discourse blah blah blah. Star Wars was tapping into Edgar Rice Burroughs, and then when John Carter came out it was criticised for being too similar to Star Wars. If a film is good, and is at least trying to forge its own mythology, then who cares how much it riffs on a predecessor? If a film is good. Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon is good……until it isn’t. The problem is that the positive stuff is all contained in the opening half-hour, before the first instance of tasteless violence occurs, and sets the film on a path of impressively executed, but thoroughly uninvolving videogame cut scene sequences. This is a film for Valerian apologists. A film in which there are moments of big-screen beauty, something Snyder has mastered throughout his career, but one so uneven and scattered across how ever many corners of this universe he has created, that you don’t care about anything beyond the superficiality of it all. At least Valerian had a sense of humour. Aside from a few Charlie Hunnam witticisms, this is strictly po-faced stuff.  It all begins with so much promise; sun-kissed vistas, lens flare, and a young protagonist working on a farm for their adoptive family (derivative discourse blah blah blah). It’s the stuff of the Shire or Tatooine, and hints at a hero’s arc to rival the best sci-fi or fantasy fables. Archetypes are introduced, rivalries forged, and even the threat of a love-triangle can’t prevent you from being intrigued by Sofia Boutella’s mysterious Kora. It’s soapy, and the dialogue is a little clunky, but it has a charm, and is playing out against a stunning backdrop which suggests a rich world for our adventurers to explore.  Kora’s world and the film are shaken up by the arrival of Ed Skrein’s big bad, Admiral Atticus Nobel, who’s a little bit Tom Hardy in Legend crossed with a late 90s Guy Ritchie character. Despite the broad brushstrokes of villainy that he brings to the role, his performance still manages to carry some genuine menace, and along with Boutella is the only character who doesn’t feel completely like a computer game avatar.  In fact, Boutella is the reason for sticking with the film, and potentially the franchise as a whole. She’s requisitely kick-ass when it comes to the action sequences, and has a presence which makes you wish they’d scratch beneath the surface of Kora a little more than exposition heavy flashbacks that fill in some of the many blanks.  Development for each of the characters is reserved for a protracted showy mid-section meet-the-gang sequence, which plays out less like a movie, and more like a series of impressive anime shorts. Bae Doona’s Nemesis gets a cool AF Darth Maul style showdown with a giant spider-woman, at which point it’s worth noting the creature design in Rebel Moon is incredible, and then she disappears into the background. Staz Nair’s warrior Tarak is put through a heroic trial which sees him riding a giant crow, and then he disappears into the background. And spare a thought for Djimon Hounsou’s General Titus, whose performance, bar a final reel monologue, must be somewhere on the cutting room floor, because he is permanently consigned that background.  Excuses will be made considering A Child of Fire is the first installment of a two, or even three part franchise, but you have to establish some connection to the story or the people populating it to ensure viewers will want to come back, and unfortunately Rebel Moon doesn’t come close to achieving that. ",NEGATIVE

"Dec 15, 2023"," REBEL MOON – PART 1: A CHILD OF FIRE plays like we’re watching Zack Snyder plagiarize his homework in real time. What should’ve been an inspired homage to well-known sci-fi classics comes across as cribbed from Cliff’s Notes, scribbled down by a sleep-deprived college student who only half paid attention in film class. The once-visionary auteur heavily borrows from many others to deliver his own refurbished movie mashup, taking the blueprint from SEVEN SAMURAI and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and littering it with blunt references to STAR WARS, BLADE RUNNER, LORD OF THE RINGS, THE MATRIX, DUNE and AVATAR. Had he exercised compelling, crafty originality in between those lines, as he’s previously proven capable of doing, there might be something to this creative exercise. However, what we get is a disappointingly vapid byproduct of outsized ambitions and squandered sentiments. Snyder and his co-screenwriters Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad saddle their picture and actors with a parade of exposition right off the bat. The narrated backstory (by Anthony Hopkins, who voices a less perky C-3PO-esque robot named Jimmy) tells of the assassination of the royal bloodline which led the galaxy to interplanetary war and strife. The King’s tyrannical right-hand-man Balisarius (Fra Fee) seized command as a revolution took place. Yet there are insurgent rebels on the rise and brutal emissary Admiral Atticus Nobel (Ed Skrein) has been tasked to ferret out the motherworld’s enemies, laying waste to planets and their people. The next destination on Noble’s galactic warship tour is Veldt, a farming planet whose resources are beginning to dwindle. He’s demanding a large cut of their yearly harvest – a commodity they can’t spare. The all-too-naive pacifists led by Sindri (Corey Stoll) and advised by Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) think they can negotiate. However, one new member of this peaceful community knows better: Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former star soldier turned deserter who’s been laying low on Veldt since the war broke out. After it becomes clear there’s no deal to be had, Kora and Gunnar set off on a planet-hopping adventure to recruit a team of mercenaries to help fight back. Those include downtrodden general Titus (Djimon Hounsou), vengeful swordswoman Nemesis (Bae Doona), bounty hunting opportunist Kai (Charlie Hunnam), underestimated slave Tarak (Staz Nair) and insurgent leader Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher). While this set-up works on paper, in execution it becomes a dull, frustrating, convoluted mess. Snyder, Hatten and Johnstad value telling over showing, not only when it comes to the elongated speech dumps delivered by the actors (Boutella and Hopkins shouldering the worst of it), but also in terms of the characters’ motivational drives. It’s all text and no subtext. They don’t make room for subtleties to land, let alone properly develop them in the first place or enhance them with the mounting dramatic stakes and character arcs. Though they’re essentially poaching from familiar works, they fail to understand the basic mechanics behind those films when it comes to successful narrative and character function. Putting their inspirations in a blender doesn’t make this concoction instantly palatable. They need to finesse it, adding connective, innovative ingredients, which they disappointingly don’t do. Even worse, and perhaps more insulting, they repeatedly spell out what’s going on as if the audience has forgotten, aren’t paying attention or have fallen asleep. Snyder, who did a terrific job world-building and team-building in ARMY OF THE DEAD, botches both in his franchise-starting hopeful. The expansive galactic vistas and majestic planetary landscapes are blurry (thanks to the special optics Snyder custom builds), murky and rendered with ropey CGI. The aesthetics are typically at odds with the shocking lack of immersive qualities. And this doesn’t help during the big action sequences that frequently cut away from the hits before they happen, leaving any satiation from the punches as an unrequited audience request.  Gathering the team takes far too long, and with each primary cast member, their cinematic references are glaringly undisguised. Nemesis’ fight with a spiderwoman (Jena Malone) echoes LORD OF THE RINGS. Tarak’s taming of a wild beast is AVATAR-influenced. Kai is very Han Solo/ Lando Calrissian-coded. And on and on. Snyder also can’t help but fall prey to his worst sophomoric tendencies. Kora’s wannabe empowering, Cambellian “answering the call” sequence, which has her bosom heaving in a cleavage-revealing tank top, starts with a violent threat of the rape of a village woman. Soon thereafter, in a scene that plays as homophobic, an alien portrayed as an offensive homosexual stereotype molests Gunnar in a seedy bar (this film’s version of STAR WARS’ Cantina). It’s true that not every movie – especially those on the mega-scale Snyder creates – needs to dole out a heavy, radical message. However, it’s fairly clear that’s what he and his screenwriting cohorts are attempting with their commentary on marginalized communities championing a rebellion against fascist warlords. The filmmakers appear to be frightened, or at least ill-equipped, to sort out their political points and thematic material surrounding genocide, societal displacement, and corruptive power that leads to megalomaniacal Neo-Nazi-esque personalities. What’s there is bloodless and toothless – maddening lackluster superficiality that comes down to a horrendously basic, uninspired good-against-evil battle for peace.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023"," 
	They gather a diverse group of warriors, each seeking atonement: Kai (Hunnam), a skilled pilot; General Titus, a famed leader (Hounsou); Nemesis (Bae), an expert swordfighter; Tarak (Nair), a detainee with noble origins; and Milius (E. Duffy), a fervent resistance member. Meanwhile, on planet Veldt, an old robotic guardian named Jimmy (Dustin Ceithamer) awakens, ready to defend the colony. As the threat from the Motherworld looms, these rebels must unite and learn to fight together to save their new home. 
Rebel Moon draws heavily from a variety of influences – a touch of Star Wars as if it was told from the point of view of an elite stormtrooper, a hint of Avatar’s lush world-building, a dash of Ghost in the Shell and the cybernetic intrigue, with a sprinkle of Starship Troopers, there is some Dune in there and a whole slew of other influences. Whatever the overall opinion is of his work, Snyder always sustains a clear, and often singular vision. However, these elements are jam-packed into a cinematic experience that feels more derivative than innovative. 
	The film’s reliance on slow motion, a stylistic hallmark of Snyder’s earlier works, feels antiquated and distracting. Rather than enhancing the action sequences, it often serves to obscure them, suggesting an attempt to mask possible flaws in direction and choreography.  
	Boutella’s performance as Kora is a highlight, demonstrating her potential as a leading figure in the action genre. Yet, the script fails to fully utilize her talents. Kora’s interactions with other characters are superficial, and her involvement in action scenes are too sporadic. The supporting cast of warriors, each with their own backstory of redemption, brings diversity to the storytelling but lacks the necessary development to make their stories resonate in the foreground. 
Rebel Moon is a film that struggles to find its own voice amidst a litany of borrowed themes and styles. While visually impressive, it lacks the coherence and character depth needed to elevate it beyond a mere pastiche of its influences. Snyder’s fans might find elements to appreciate, but for those seeking a fresh and engaging sci-fi adventure, this film may not hit the mark. Then again, this is part one so maybe part two will give the narrative room to breathe.

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Rebel Moon-Part One: A Child of Fire, in theaters Friday and on Netflix on Thursday, is an entertaining filtering of science fiction and general storytelling tropes through the lens of creator/director Zack Snyder.
Part One gathers a team of heroes for a new space saga.
Advertisement
Kora (Sofia Boutella) is living on a peaceful farming planet. The tyrannical Motherworlds send Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) to compel the farmers to share their grain with his army.
Naive Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) thinks he can negotiate with Noble, but only makes it worse when he demands the bulk of their harvest and leaves an occupying force on the ground. Kora is going to flee, but steps in when the soldiers try to rape a young girl.
With the Motherworlds inevitably coming back to retaliate, Kora and Gunnar set out to build a rebellion. They travel from planet to planet amassing their squad.

Rebel Moon is an original in that there was no prior material it adapts, but it didn't invent modest people rising up against oppressors, let alone an oppressive space empire. Snyder did invent the specific mythology and characters of this world and co-wrote the script with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten.
But, Rebel Moon doesn't try to avoid comparisons to Star Wars. In fact, it's likely Snyder's pitch to Netflix could have been ""This is our Star Wars.""
In Star Wars, the Rebel Alliance already existed and Luke Skywalker wanted to join it. Rebel Moon-Part One is entirely about recruiting the leaders who can command non-soldiers against an army.
It seems that Kora and Gunnar find each hero already in the middle of their own epic story. It expands the scope of the film to hint at stories that were in progress before the protagonists got there, but converge when the characters join the rebellion.
These include rogue loner Kai (Charlie Hunnam), slave Tarak (Staz Nair), swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae), disgraced General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), and siblings Darrian (Ray Fisher) and Devra Bloodaxe (Cleopatra Coleman) who already are defending their planet from the Motherworlds.
Each of those planets creates a diverse galaxy far, far away. They meet Kai in what is essentially a western saloon filled with aliens. Yes, the Star Wars cantina also was a space-age saloon, but this one is really like a western with swinging wooden doors.
Advertisement
Westerns and science fiction are often entwined. Star Trek was considered a western in space and the short-lived Firefly also called itself a western, so a literal sandy frontier street fits in well.
Nemesis lives on a mining planet that's more industrial, full of machinery. Star Wars worlds tend to focus on one simple element - for example, all desert, or all ice or all volcano. These worlds feel like there are more levels and grades to their topography.
In these outlaw worlds, random aliens can be just as threatening as the Motherworlds army. Kora fights them all in slow motion, which is Snyder's hallmark. Snyder cuts to a wide shot when Kora takes shots at the head, but she is blowing people's heads off.
Scenes that look more obviously filmed in front of a screen can be excused because most science-fiction has to be filmed against artificial backgrounds. But also, Snyder pioneered making an entire movie on green screen with 300, so if anyone is allowed to use it, he is.
Early scenes do provide more detail on how oppression works. Noble isn't just the generic villain. He demonstrates how malicious leaders can trick the innocent into cooperating.
Even after seeing Noble's true colors, many in the farming colony remain naive and think they can prove their worth and ensure survival.

He's so deserving of a slap in the face that his confrontation with Kora can't come soon enough. Since Part One is right in the title, it's clear the Motherworlds won't be defeated just yet.

"Dec 15, 2023"," A robot sits along a riverbank and washes his face. The action serves an obvious utility. Moments earlier space fascists (which seem in overabundance these days) bullied the automaton, knocking his face into the dirt, and kicking him while he’s down. Still, it is in how Zack Snyder stages the machine’s cleansing ritual that sticks with me. Voiced by the endlessly regal Anthony Hopkins, our ostensible C-3PO appears to have the soul of Lear—or at least Odin given Rebel Moon’s visual lexicon.  The android waxes nostalgic about a slain king and tells a young girl who watches him bathe that her countenance provides him “with a feeling of warmth” and reverie as he recalls a princess who died. And when she puts literal flowers in his hair (gears?), the toaster with legs blushes. No, really, lights implanted in his face turn red. Does he feel embarrassment? Grief? That cool water in his hand, just as he claims to know what warmth is? When we see him later in the film, why has he donned the antlers of an elk, transforming his silhouette into that of a Viking god? The appeal of Zack Snyder’s films is that the director is a master at crafting exactly such evocative images. Nearly every frame of his movies are the cinematic equivalent of a comic book penciler who draws only in splash pages. You’re encouraged to infer meaning and depth within every composition and atop each exceedingly stylized camera setup. Yet the meaning of it all is illusory, or at least no more profound than a teenager in the ‘70s replicating Dungeons & Dragons cover art on the side of his station wagon. It’s eye-catching, but to the uninitiated it comes across as more bemusing or hokey than illuminating. Such is the breadth and totality of Snyder’s latest magnum opus, a space opera so grandiose it needed to be divided into two parts. Maybe the impetus for that choice will be clearer in April when the second half of the movie hits Netflix, but as of right now, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire’s justification for its fractured structure is elusive. In effect, the film is another retelling of Seven Samurai, this time in space and also at a glacial place. Its other points of reference and imitation are equally glaring. Alien, Star Trek, and even fantasy epics like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter’s Hippogriff-riding all get nicked. Yet most prevalent, and oppressive, of the inspirations is Star Wars, which appears to have been doused in a beleaguering graywash, and with a dollop of nihilism, before getting tossed in a spin cycle and coming out like… this. After all, Rebel Moon is about (surprise, surprise) a defiant rebel standing against an evil empire, although when we meet her she has no plans to ever fight again. Raised since childhood to be a foot soldier (or stormtrooper) for an imperial government centered around “Motherworld,” Kora (Sofia Boutella) has since sworn off violence and found peace on a small farming moon in the outskirts of the galaxy. Living in a provincial community that resembles a medieval Nordic village, Kora is content with life if not overjoyed. That changes on the day the Imperium arrives. Nothing but condescending smiles and malevolent, searching eyes, Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) brings immediate violence and the threat of death to town. If this pastoral commune does not surrender its entire crop in 10 weeks’ time to Noble’s dreadnought, he will massacre everyone on the moon. Kora’s first (and blessedly) brief instinct is to run, but after seeing imperial soldiers attempt to brutalize an underage girl, she has a change of heart—and plenty of slow-mo shots of her hacking at the brownshirts’ own vital organs too. She and the smitten farmer Gunnar (Michael Huisman) will traverse the stars in order to find a disgraced rebel general named Titus (Djimon Hounsou), insurgents in search of a leader, and other assorted rogues, scoundrels, and ciphers bereft of characterization. Together they’ll return to the Space Norsemen as magnificent heroes, ready to fight the might of the Imperium. Much has been made in the press about how Snyder envisioned Rebel Moon as Star Wars for adults. Our own correspondent was told it’s George Lucas’ fantasy “but with violence, sex, and swearing.” Yet for all that alleged maturity, a viewer is left to ponder why is the sex, along with everything else in this universe, so uniformly violent? In Part One, we get graphic attempted space rape, leering space pedophiles, and even a most unwelcome hint of space tentacle foreplay. But any sense of emotional or healthy connection between grown-ups, romantic or otherwise, is absent. There are adult characters, to be sure, but the only way they communicate is through competitions of stoicism and adolescent brooding, exposition blather that sounds like a thousand other movies, or other hitherto unlisted forms of cruelty and depravity. Despite existing in a galaxy with a thousand star systems and worlds, there is no sunlight in the thing. Or charm. It is an unrelentingly bleak cosmos that mistakes a lack of humor for a lack of life. At one point, a character muses that their newest idyllic location is a good place “to die.” None of them seem to spare a moment’s thought on what it might be like to really live. At this point, dear reader, it should be pretty obvious Rebel Moon was not for me, nor would it be for anyone else who rolls their eyes at the thought of watching a Star Wars movie where the lightsabers are replaced by clubs, and when they hit someone, a shot of bloody teeth splattering across the floor will surely follow. It’s a derivative work that is full of despair. And yet, strangely, I cannot help but respect Snyder for getting to make it in exactly the shade of grim-dark he wanted. Whatever shortcomings are inherent in the screenplay’s collection of clichés, the actual world-building onscreen is dense. The alien designs we witness at its Mos Eisley-like bar pull just as much from mythology as they do the works of Lucas or H.R. Giger. There are spider-women who look like something Theseus would fight in the Labyrinth, and one parasitical alien uses a human being as a meat puppet in a watering hole without anyone batting an eye. It’s even kind of nice to see Snyder double down on his use of speed-ramping slow motion again after all these years, which whether by design or accident turn flashbacks of Kora’s Space Nazi days into a regular intergalactic Leni Riefenstahl picture. Rebel Moon has a soul and a personality imbued by the hands of its creator. I might personally find that soul to be repulsive, but in an age where so many big budget action movies and sci-fi products are scared of anything approaching a human touch—including the most recent Star Wars movie—and where everything is boiled down to the lowest common denominator of innocuous content, it’s nice that Snyder still gets to make exactly the movie he wants for exactly his kind of audience. Everyone else, however, should look for the escape pod now. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire opens in limited release on Friday, Dec. 15 and premieres globally on Netflix on Dec. 21.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023"," Do you like Star Wars? How about Lord of the Rings? Harry Potter? Dune? What about The Matrix? Would you like to see elements of all of those and more in the skeleton of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai? If the answer to any of that is yes, Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire is the movie for you. Rebel Moon is a cacophony of sci-fi tropes. Pieces are clipped from every inch of sci-fi history and put back together into one big package. Which, admittedly, isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Every film you’ve ever seen has been inspired by, or in some cases directly derivative of, something else. There’s a noteworthy pleasure in seeing something familiar spun ever-so-slightly in a new context, and Rebel Moon provides lots and lots of that. The problem with the way Rebel Moon does it though is it’s not really about anything. All of the movies and franchises named above are about something grander than themselves. Rebel Moon has long speeches about loyalty, family, honor, purpose, all kinds of things. But presented as such, those themes feel like a big hodgepodge too, with few if any of them landing. The result is a film that’s undeniably beautiful, expertly designed, and enjoyable enough to watch,  but leaves little lasting impression. Snyder, who directs and co-wrote the movie with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, centers his story on Kora, played by Sofia Boutella. Kora is a mysterious woman living a humble life in a remote farming village on the planet Veldt. Things change though when a ship from the villainous Motherworld arrives and threatens to take everything from her and the village. Quickly we learn Kora isn’t so simple after all and she’s going to have to travel the galaxy to find help so Veldt can stand up to Motherworld. While Snyder packs his story, and each frame, with all manner of detail begging to be explored further, the basic throughline is rather easy to follow. Kora teams up with a fellow farmer named Gunnar (Michiel Huisman); together they find a scoundrel named Kai (Charlie Hunnam), in a bar filled with aliens of course. The pair then hire Kai to fly them to find General Titus (Djimon Hounsou) who they hope will help them. Along the way, Kai has a few ideas of other warriors they can pick up, which they do, in rather rapid succession. Each character who joins Kora and her friends creates a new pocket of the movie. New planet, new creatures, quick action scene, and we’re off to the next thing. Some of these scenes, such as one featuring Sucker Punch star Jena Malone as a massive, Shelob-like killer spider, are fun in a “This is bonkers” way. Others, such as the freeing of a slave named Tarak (Staz Nair) by allowing him to recreate a film scene from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, are too easy and on the nose. In every case though, just as you begin to get interested in this new character, they join the group, fade into the background, and it’s on to the next one. In between, there are multiple flashbacks to Kora’s past, stuffed with all sorts of interesting reveals—reveals that, unfortunately for the film,  are frequently more intriguing than the story at hand. We also spend a good chunk of time with the evil Admiral Noble played by Ed Skrein. He’s basically a Darth Vader-like disciple to the universe’s current leader, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), and Skrein’s performance is Rebel Moon’s big standout. Noble is ruthless and captivating. Plus, because he’s the primary face of evil in the film, we spend lots of time with him, learn more about him, and come to appreciate the character quite a bit. The problem with that is his characterization, in contrast to the film’s band of heroes,  illustrates a major flaw in Snyder’s work. With the exception of Kora, the film’s heroes are paper-thin. Each is discovered, looked at, and then filed into the background. Noble, by contrast, is a fuller, more complex character,  which doesn’t necessarily serve the story that well, at least in this movie. Oh, right. Missed in all this discussion is the fact that this Rebel Moon is, in fact, “Part One” as Snyder and Netflix have a part two and maybe more coming in the future. Watching this film, that’s a fact that’s both slightly encouraging but also restrictive. At the beginning of the film, if you were to guess where this seemingly familiar story would end, you would be wrong. There’s lots of plot and character left to explore, and one or two unexpected twists along the way. In addition, Snyder wraps this up in a more satisfying way than some other recent films that have been split like this. But to do so, the climax feels forced, rushed, and not in line with the implied trajectory of the film. The final action scene is as if Snyder had a full movie in mind, decided to break it in two, and wedged in a whole new sequence to complicate things for the sake of complication. That means, as Rebel Moon - Part One ends, you’re left scratching your head a bit. Snyder’s visuals, design, and creature effects are all second to none. Those things absolutely make what you’re watching entertaining. But when the film ends, you don’t feel like you’ve learned much beyond what’s unfolded on screen. Who are these characters? Why should we care? What’s this all been about? I’ll definitely watch Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver when it debuts next year, just to see how Kora’s story plays out, but I’d imagine not everyone will continue for the ride.

"Dec 15, 2023","  Zack Snyder disappoints in a galaxy far, far away as his space opera franchise stumbles with a contrived start. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is an uninspired mishmash of familiar themes, characters, and settings taken from classic blockbusters. The film unfurls like a role-playing video game where a deadly protagonist doles out her backstory while collecting allies on a quest for salvation. The relatively simple plot has a one-note ensemble of ragtag revolutionaries that struggle to resonate with the audience. Initially slick action sequences become banal from the excessive use of slow motion cinematography. We've seen this all before and unfortunately done better.   The film's premise has the Motherworld, an Empire-like autocracy, subjugating the universe with ruthless oppression and bloody carnage. A lineage that lasted for 1000 generations is broken after a mysterious assassin kills the king (Cary Elwes) and royal family. Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) takes control of the Imperium and vows to crush anyone that tries to break free of the Motherworld's iron grip. He unleashes the sadistic General Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), who hugs victims before smashing their skulls, to thwart an insurgency brewing on the outer rim planets. Siblings known as the Bloodaxes are attacking Imperium forces on a growing scale.   On the red moon of Veldt, a lone woman, Kora (Sofia Boutella), works the fields to prepare for the next planting. She finds elusive peace tilling the dirt. Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), admires her longingly from a distance before beckoning Kora to join the village in celebration. The Father (Corey Stoll) urges everyone to enjoy the party and dutifully fornicate later to spur the blooming seeds. Kora, an outsider who's never spoken of her past, may have finally found a home.   The following day brings a terrifying threat. General Noble's powerful dreadnought battleship appears in the sky. The villagers cower in the longhouse as Noble lands with his troops. He'd heard their fields were prosperous with abundant harvests. The Motherworld needs grain to stamp out the rebellion. Father swears his people are loyal citizens, but they only have enough for themselves. Noble doesn't know that Gunnar had sold grain to the Bloodaxes. He'll return in two months for every morsel of food.   Noble leaves a platoon of troops and their service robot behind. Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) was a mechanical knight that fought for the Motherworld. His kind became laborers after putting down arms in response to the king's death. The vile soldiers make their presence felt but underestimate Kora's abilities. Her friends won't be enslaved or massacred by the Imperium. She'll go with Gunnar to find the Bloodaxes. They must recruit warriors to stand against Noble's imminent return.   Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire takes its primary storyline from The Magnificent Seven and Star Wars. Hapless villagers need badass killers to fight thieving and merciless invaders. Sounds like a plan, but Kora constantly reiterates throughout that fighting a dreadnought may be a fruitless endeavor. It's a weapon capable of destroying planets, but let's go assemble a team anyway instead of fleeing. This logic makes little sense if Kora believes their chances are that slim.   Elements from other films are replicated during Kora's journey. Tarak (Staz Nair), long-haired and glistening in bodybuilder oil, can talk to animals and ride exotic creatures like a hippogriff. He feels plucked out of Harry Potter and Avatar with shredded six-pack abs. Nemesis (Doona Bae) wields two laser swords that could easily be Sith lighsabers. Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a conniving smuggler, meets Kora and Gunnar in a Mos Eisley-esque cantina like Han Solo.   The biggest head-scratcher is Kora's mission to find a legendary warrior called General Titus (Djimon Hounsou). He's supposed to be an unparalleled military strategist but has almost no dialogue, and like everyone else, jumps on the bandwagon with little prodding. They're all just itching for payback against the Imperium. The supporting characters are unoriginal with poor exposition. The cast has scant chemistry in cardboard interactions that aren't endearing.   The film's production design lacks imagination. The Imperium's goons wear Nazi SS costumes with black, gold, and red insignias. Noble could have yelled ""Sieg Heil"" at any point. Their ships are bulky with cannons protruding and docking ports. Why not go for sleek shapes like TIE fighters and X-wings? How can Rebel Moonunabashedly pilfer from Star Wars but somehow fail to copy the awesome ships? Kids won't be clamoring for these toys.   Snyder (Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen, Justice League) takes a harder edge with a rote script. Rebel Moon veers into adult territory with graphic action scenes and sexual violence. Imperium soldiers target women as spoils of war. This repugnant turn raises the stakes. There's satisfaction in watching fiendish baddies get eviscerated, but Snyder's reliance on slow motion is tiresome. Every battle and fight plods to a near standstill to highlight climatic moments. This visual tactic gets old. Action loses entertainment value by being predictable.   We must take into consideration this is the first half of a bigger story. That grants some narrative leeway, but the film isn't remarkable in any regard. It's a stale retread of better material with dull characters. Kora and the gang aren't interesting. You don't root for them and that's a weak foundation to build on.   Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is a production of The Stone Quarry and Grand Electric. It will have a limited theatrical release on December 15th, followed by a Netflix streaming premiere on the 21st.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. The MMA fighter will make his acting debut in the reimagining for Prime Video, but Hollywood was courting him long before Doug Liman came along. For Ms. Marvel star Iman Vellani, it seems to be a question of when she will return to the MCU rather than a question of if.  The chosen one is one of the most widely recognizable staples of genre fiction. Dune: Part Two takes an axe to the very concept of it.  Tim Blake Nelson may have a big role in next year's Captain America 4, but he could have also been part of this year's epic Dune sequel. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023"," Zack Snyder is stretching so hard to make an epic space opera with Rebel Moon that he forgets to give us rounded characters. As failures go, though, it’s a handsome one. There are lots of reasons to be excited about Rebel Moon. Whether you’re a fully paid-up member of the Zack Snyder fan army or not, you have to concede that he’s an ambitious and unique filmmaker who relishes the chance to paint on a massive canvas. And canvases don’t come much bigger than a two-part Netflix space opera.
 As has been widely reported, Rebel Moon started life as Snyder’s pitch for some new Star Wars movies, but he has retooled it into something entirely original. Well, I say original. It pilfers liberally from the best science fiction movies, adding lashings of Dune and even Doctor Who to its distinctly Lucas-esque storytelling, all built upon a story structure inspired by some of the best Westerns – most notably The Magnificent Seven.
 Our protagonist is Sofia Boutella’s Kora – a former warrior for the despotic Motherworld who now lives in exile as part of a tranquil farming community. But her tragic backstory – we know it’s tragic because it’s told through multiple maudlin flashbacks – intrudes upon her new life when Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) arrives and demands supplies. Yep, in true Star Wars style, the first half of this movie is about the logistics and economics of grain harvesting.
 Kora soon finds herself in the crosshairs of the Motherworld and its mostly unseen leader, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). With humble farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) alongside her, Kora sets off to enlist the superbly-monikered rebel leader Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) and renowned warrior General Titus (Djimon Hounsou) to her cause, picking up some other colorful new allies along the way.
 Let’s start with the good stuff. In a world in which so many new movies of this scale are hamstrung by piss-poor VFX, Rebel Moon looks outstanding. Every different planet is visually distinct and the decision to build as many practical sets as possible pays off handsomely. These worlds feel lived-in and real, rather than the CGI-sterilized nothing-worlds of the Star Wars prequels.
 That helps when it comes to the action, which benefits from Snyder’s patented music video-style editing – I hope you like slow-mo – and some terrific stunt work. A climactic face-off between Boutella and Skrein gets particularly nasty and inventive. When the Rebel Moon release date comes around, watch out for the flying teeth.
 So in terms of style, it’s a winner. Unfortunately, the problems emerge when it comes to substance: there isn’t any. The script, penned by Snyder along with regular collaborators Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, does next to nothing to make its audience care about its central characters. Rebel Moon is so busy telling us how epic everything is that it forgets how important character is to making stories feel significant.
 There’s not so much characterization here as there is a series of super-wordy flashbacks in which the movie delves back into its own tangled web of lore. All of this will probably make for a great novelization, but it does nothing on the big screen. The movie never has a chance to build any momentum because it keeps stopping to tell us who these people are and why we’re supposed to care, instead of showing us those things. It’s just not enough.
 The performances are impressively committed, but none of the cast has anything to grip onto in order to build a character. Charlie Hunnam, in particular, sticks out like a sore thumb. He’s a standard roguish type, hamstrung by an absurd and inconsistent Northern Irish accent. Why does this interstellar ruffian sound like he’s from Belfast? We’ll never know. He doesn’t even get a flashback.
 Sofia Boutella, though, does deserve praise for her work in the lead role. She brings a real physicality to her performance and acquits herself well during the enjoyably hard-hitting action sequences, for which she mostly did her own stunts. Whenever she and the impressively slimy Skrein are on screen together, the film briefly comes alive.
 Rebel Moon also falls victim to something that has been a perennial issue throughout 2023 – part one syndrome. But perhaps more than any other example of this phenomenon – Spider-Verse, Fast X, Mission: Impossible, etc – Rebel Moon feels like an orphaned half of a movie. It’s very much the first act of a story with a climactic action sequence bolted on in the hope of preventing audiences from feeling short-changed. It doesn’t work.
 Despite all of this, though, there’s something about Rebel Moon that almost carries it through the problems. It’s impossible to fault its ambition and, when it occasionally finds its groove, it’s loads of fun. Unfortunately, there’s far too much dead air and leaden meandering, with a gaping void where all of the heart and humanity should be.
 But while this won’t trouble any list of 2023’s best movies, I am curious about whether part two can turn the spaceship around. So I guess if we view this as a very extended trailer for part two, it could work? That feels like the very definition of damning with faint praise.

"Dec 15, 2023"," When George Lucas tried to get the rights to “Flash Gordon” in the early 1970s, and failed, he decided to make his own film in the style of “Flash Gordon.” The result was a movie called “Star Wars,” which has — in the nearly 50 years since its creation — spawned a lot of knockoffs of its own. The latest, Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon – Part 1: A Child of Fire,” came about in a similar way. Snyder famously pitched an idea for a “Star Wars” spin-off inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s “Seven Samurai.” When that project didn’t come together. he transformed his old pitch into a new film. Except Lucas infused his “Flash Gordon” riff with lots of other influences, so although you can recognize the individual elements — “The Hidden Fortress,” “The Dam Busters,” “Silent Running,” etc. — “Star Wars” still feels like its own film. But Zack Snyder’s “Star Wars” riff is pretty much just “Star Wars.” Farmers going to cantinas full of weird aliens. Cocky smugglers with questionable morals who take them on their journey. Mysterious badasses with glowing swords that cut through anything. An evil empire that dresses like Nazis. It’s “Star Wars” crossed with “Seven Samurai,” sure, but not much else and that’s also been done already with the Roger Corman-produced “Battle Beyond the Stars” (1980). So nothing about “Rebel Moon” feels fresh. Competent, usually, but never fresh. Indeed, the biggest difference is that Zack Snyder is, well, Zack Snyder. “Rebel Moon” is full of the slow-motion action sequences he’s famous for, and it’s unusually violent for a space opera. There’s an upsetting attempted sexual assault scene that throws a pall over the whole first act. And then there’s the scene where Luke Skywalker gets hassled in a bar and the retired soldier has to save him — sorry, the scene where “Gunnar” gets hassled in a bar and the retired soldier has to save him, except now it’s about a gay and physically grotesque sexual predator who won’t take “no” for an answer and gets killed instead of just getting his arm cut off. Who is that scene for, we have to ask? Why, in a movie about saving fictional oppressed people, is there a scene that goes out of its way to present a demonic caricature of actually oppressed people? Even “Rebel Moon’s” simplistic argument that “cruelty is bad” gets undermined by the film’s insistence that cruelty is also entertainment. “Rebel Moon – Part 1: A Child of Fire” stars Sofia Boutella as Kora, a soldier with a mysterious past living a quiet life in a village full of peaceful farmers. When a giant warship from the Motherworld shows up, the gestapo-esque Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) declares that he’s searching for rebels and he needs this one tiny town to supply his entire army with grain. He’ll return in ten weeks to collect, even if it means the farmers will starve to death. Noble leaves behind a small squad of rapists and one pacifist robot, the latter of whom is voiced by Anthony Hopkins. The robot explains that the Motherworld was ruled by an honorable royal family, whose princess was prophesied to bring peace to the galaxy. With that royal family now dead, the robot army refuses to fight anymore, and now they just lug crates around for the human soldiers. Never mind that later in the movie we see that same king of the Motherworld in flashbacks and he’s celebrating his armies for conquering planets and committing mass murder. The film still claims he was the good guy keeping Motherworld from getting… I dunno, even eviler? “Rebel Moon’s” attitudes towards tyranny are a little inconsistent and confusing. When Kora kills the soldiers after they try to assault a young girl — in a sequence, again, so unnecessarily disturbing you can’t help wonder why the film had to go there at all — the village is left with no choice. They’ll have to fight Noble’s army when he returns. So Kora teams up with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a farmer who got their leader killed because he was a greedy capitalist — but who will then be portrayed as a soulful, innocent, heroic type for the rest of movie, because again, consistency is not “Rebel Moon’s” strong suit — and sets out to enlist a group of warriors to protect the village. What follows is a series of vignettes where Kora meets larger than life badasses who all just happen to be in the middle of pulpy situations. Tarak (Staz Nair) is trapped in indentured servitude and can’t get out unless he tames a space griffin. Nemesis (Doona Bae) is a cyborg with light sabers who had fighting a giant spider on her “to do” list that afternoon. Titus (Djimon Hounsou) is a former Motherworld general now working as a gladiator, although apparently we meet him on his day off from gladiating, which feels like a bit of a copout. Devra Bloodaxe (Cleopatra Coleman) and her brother Darrian (Ray Fisher) are rebel leaders, who seem to lack ambition in the whole “rebellion” department. And Kai (Charlie Hunnam) is literally just Han Solo. The majority of these side quests are exciting and nifty to look at. Zack Snyder, who is also the film’s cinematographer, knows how to make an action sequence look epic, even if the climactic battle quickly loses track of where all the characters are, and then descends into spatial chaos. Still, as “Star Wars” knockoffs go, “Rebel Moon” is one of the most visually ambitious, and the visual effects creations are often genuinely interesting, although some of them are less convincingly rendered than others. The cast is all over the place as well. Charlie Hunnam looks like he’s having fun. Djimon Hounsou looks like he’s super bored. Ed Skrein chews scenery and seems to particularly enjoy the bit where we find out his character has a tentacle fetish. But it’s Boutella who carries “Rebel Moon” on her shoulders, and once again reminds us that she’s a great action movie actor. Snyder’s space opera may not be a great action movie, but at least it’s an excellent showcase for Boutella and Hunnam, and an adequate showcase for most of the others. “Rebel Moon – Part 1: A Child of Fire” isn’t a complete film. The story will continue and presumably conclude in the next installment. So perhaps some of this movie’s issues will be addressed later on, and “Part 1” will improve with the benefit of hindsight. Or perhaps it will look worse after the follow-up comes out, which is equally plausible. Until then it is simply what it is, and that is a hugely expensive but uninspired “Star Wars” knockoff with some thrilling action sequences, and some truly ugly moments that taint the entire thing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire is a solid sci-fi fantasy film, packed with the director’s trademark style and action sequences. While very familiar in its homages to other films, it’s fresh enough to keep audiences engaged for the universe to come. Rebel Moon has all the bells and whistles that are expected from a Zack Snyder production. His visual flair and aesthetic are at full display as the film blends sci-fi and fantasy akin to the likes of Dune. While the film has several homages to icons like Star Wars and Seven Samurai, it’s still unique in its visual identity. The film has an aesthetic feeling closer to an anime or RPG video game than the aforementioned movies. Snyder’s style has evolved from film to film, and some of it can be attributed to how he challenges himself to add new tools to his craft. For Rebel Moon, Snyder wears several hats from director, co-writer, and cinematographer. While his best films shared these responsibilities more evenly, Rebel Moon is truly a Snyder film from every side of production. Rebel Moon has been in the back of Snyder’s mind for decades. Years before his Justice League trilogy, Zombie flicks, or Watchmen, the director had toyed with the concept of his own space opera. Inspired by the favorite movies and magazines he read growing up, the film almost found its way in the form of a Star Wars film before the studio shifted to The Force Awakens. With the director now at Netflix, a studio looking for its next big franchise, a lot is riding on Rebel Moon to be just that.  Sofia Boutella leads the film, a victim of war and oppression, kidnapped and turned into a soldier. Audiences find Kora in the middle of her narrative arc, with flashbacks and exposition used to fill in the origins of her story. Kora feels like a blend of protagonists from Snyder’s previous films, while unique enough to stand on her own feet. She’s quiet, and stoic and exudes natural leadership in the fade of adversary. The film follows Kora as she recruits a rag-tag group of myths and misfits to lead a revolution. Rebel Moon rounds out the cast with an ensemble of Charlie Hunnam, Ed Skrein, Bae Doona, Djimon Hounsou, Ray Fisher, and Anthony Hopkins. It’s a large cast to fit into a two-hour runtime and sometimes it shows. Except for Skrein’s villainous Admiral Noble, many characters feel a little half-baked in their narrative arcs. As each character is recruited to the team, their motivations are explained quickly and their willingness to join Kora happens at a breakneck pace. This is an area where the director’s cut will undoubtedly help flesh out arcs and give more development to each of the characters. At its best, Rebel Moon – Part One establishes a sprawling universe of interesting ideas. There’s a sense of lore that expands galaxies and while the film’s gaze is strictly on a small group in one corner of that universe, the threat of the Motherworld feels real and intense. The artistic designs for the various planets and alien life are full of creativity, forging a unique playground for a Snyder film to inhabit. This feels especially fulfilled in characters like Anthony Hopkins’ Jimmy, a robot that seemingly holds the secrets to the universe, and Harmada, a spider-like alien portrayed by Jenna Malone. While the former will likely have a huge role in Rebel Moon Part Two, the first film could have used an alien figure in the main cast to help the film feel more otherworldly. Snyder tends to work best completely unencumbered by restraints or censorship. For Rebel Moon, the reveal of a director’s cut was announced from the outset by Netflix. While the Snyders have publicly stated they stand with the original cut of this film, a far cry from their detachment from 2017’s Justice League, one can’t help but think of the potential of a rated-R, three-hour cut of this film where the punches hit harder and the character arcs feel fleshed out. Ultimately, the decision to release two versions of this film instead of just the latter feels like a misstep. Snyder’s film is known for action and spectacle, and those elements are definitely present throughout. Junkie XL’s score is strong, both bombastic during the action and rhythmic during the character work. While there aren’t many huge action set pieces in the vein of Man of Steel or Batman v Superman, the film has plenty of slo-mo sequences and brutal fights that will keep fans new and old entertained. Even so, the PG-13 tone-down feels obvious and there’s an eagerness for Snyder to go full Snyder that doesn’t always happen throughout this film’s two-hour run time. Overall, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire accomplishes its primary goal of establishing an entertaining new universe. The world-building is top-notch, inspired by the icons of the past while fresh enough to stand on its own. The visuals are strong, with Zack Snyder’s trademark style throughout. The characters are engaging, albeit needing the breathing room of a director’s cut to feel fleshed out. While it’s a strong start, the director’s cut just might be the true prize.",POSITIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Zack Snyder first watched Star Wars at the impressionable age of 11 and, based on Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, the first film of his new two-part science-fiction fantasy, it looks as though, five decades later, he has finally got to make his own version.  Just like Star Wars, Rebel Moon is a tale of a small group of plucky freedom fighters waging war in space against a rapacious imperium. In addition to its near facsimiles of Star Wars' Rebel Alliance and Galactic Empire, Snyder’s movie even has its equivalents of the Death Star and the Millennium Falcon, C-3PO, and the Mos Eisley cantina.  The borrowings don’t stop there, but they don’t prevent Rebel Moon from being hugely engaging and enjoyable. Most hardcore sci-fi fans will, I suspect, find Snyder’s creation more of an homage than a rip-off. And they will undoubtedly love Sofia Boutella’s Kora, the undeniably cool protagonist who anchors this classic tale of good versus evil.  Kora is an enigmatic outsider who, before Rebel Moon — Part One begins, is rescued from a crashed spaceship. She was then taken in by a community of peace-loving farmers living on Veldt, a moon orbiting a giant gas planet in a remote reach of the Rebel Moon universe. Another outsider is inhabiting the farmers’ village: an antiquated robot soldier known as Jimmy, whose voice-over narration (provided with silky gravitas by Anthony Hopkins) fills viewers in with some of Rebel Moon’s dense backstory.  It isn’t long, however, before the farmers’ joyful harvest festival is interrupted by the arrival of ruthless emissaries from the Motherworld (the story’s evil empire). Led by Ed Skrein’s cruel Admiral Noble (the film’s Darth Vader, his cheekbones so sharp they could be weapons themselves), this force is hunting members of the rag-tag band of insurgents that are fighting the Motherworld.  Noble delivers a swift demonstration of his callousness and departs, promising to return having demanded almost all of the grain from the farmers’ harvest, a plunder that threatens the village’s very existence. So Kora, her supreme fighting skills newly apparent, sets off with mild-mannered villager Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to put together a small band of warriors prepared to put their lives on the line to protect the humble farmers. Yes, you have heard this one before.  This setup is essentially The Magnificent Seven in space. Or, to frame it slightly differently, this is Snyder following George Lucas and plundering the plot of a Japanese film classic —not Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress, famously the model for Star Wars— but Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, even more famously the model for The Magnificent Seven. Kora and Gunnar go about assembling their gang, traveling to a range of colorfully diverse outposts of the Motherworld’s empire to find willing recruits. They locate Tarak (played by a very buff Staz Nair), whose knack for bonding with outlandish creatures is demonstrated when, in one of the film’s most spectacular sequences, he manages to ride and tame a giant winged beast somewhat resembling a griffin.  They also pick up Nemesis (played by South Korean actress Doona Bae), a legendary swordswoman who, in turn, proves her skills when she takes on the monstrous Harmada (Jena Malone), a giant half-woman, half-spider who lives in the labyrinthine depths of another of the film’s realms, the teeming, perpetually dark Daggus. They also track down Titus, a former general-turned-drunken gladiator played with ruined dignity by Djimon Hounsou. There's also Charlie Hunnam’s Kai, a roguish opportunist with some of Han Solo’s gunslinger swagger, and his spacecraft — no, not the Millennium Falcon, his “Tawau-class freighter”. Kora and Gunnar’s mission builds to a fearsomely exciting climax once their band connects with the rebels’ leaders, dreadlocked brother and sister Darrian and Devra Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman) atop a floating spaceport. And, as you might expect from Snyder’s track record (his directing credits include 300, Watchmen, and superhero films Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Justice League), the action is often astounding — particularly whenever former dancer Boutella gets to display her lithe grace with a dash of cool, kick-ass daring.  The film’s special effects are admittedly not a match for some of its recent sci-fi peers — the CGI lacks the crisp detail you find in, say, Denis Villeneuve’s Dune — but then again, the reported $166 million cost stumped up by Netflix for the two Rebel Moon movies is a fraction of the sums Snyder had at his disposal on his Warner Bros projects. That said, the film never looks ""cheap"", and its preference for practical sets over CGI suits the scuffed, lived-in feel of the universe Snyder has created.  The surprising thing is that the Rebel Moon universe, for all its resemblances to its cinematic precursors, doesn’t display any anxiety of influence. Snyder hasn’t made any attempt to disguise the debt he owes to Star Wars; you can tell he revels in it. And nor has he tried to hide the traces of those same storytelling myths and motifs — and film genres, of course — that George Lucas himself drew upon: space adventures, samurai films, Westerns, World War Two resistance movies... the list goes on. Yet, having spent years imagining his story’s mythology, Snyder has created from his brew of sources a sci-fi epic with its own flavor. True, his film’s complex backstory may prove a little too rich for some viewers’ tastes, but Part Two will likely bring things into clearer focus, and it’s a shame we don’t get a chance to explore his leading characters in more depth since they're so striking. Given the film’s constraints, it is remarkable what a good job Snyder has done of making something fresh out of dated movie tropes, how cleverly he pulls new rabbits out of old hats. And, for all his story’s familiarity, he still manages to spring surprises that will knock viewers sideways.  A film critic for over 25 years, Jason admits the job can occasionally be glamorous – sitting on a film festival jury in Portugal; hanging out with Baz Luhrmann at the Chateau Marmont; chatting with Sigourney Weaver about The Archers – but he mostly spends his time in darkened rooms watching films. He’s also written theatre and opera reviews, two guide books on Rome, and competed in a race for Yachting World, whose great wheeze it was to send a seasick film critic to write about his time on the ocean waves. But Jason is happiest on dry land with a classic screwball comedy or Hitchcock thriller.",POSITIVE

Zack Snyder has made it no secret that the origin of his budding franchise ""Rebel Moon"" was a screenplay for a ""Star Wars"" spin-off he abandoned in development hell a decade ago. But even if you didn't know that context, you'd be safe to assume this would be the case based on the movie itself: a tale of a band of intergalactic outsiders teaming up to fight back against a tyrannical regime, complete with lightsabers and a bounty hunter we first meet in a cantina. It is unashamedly, unapologetically indebted to George Lucas' space saga, with the only cosmetic difference at first appearing to be the amount of grit with which this story is told.





Perhaps the biggest triumph of ""Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire"" is that, despite wearing its biggest genre influence proudly on its sleeve and mimicking many of its trademarks, it never feels derivative of it. This may be because Snyder is too distinctive a filmmaker to feel like he's simply copying somebody else's homework; the world-building is familiar on a broad scale, yes, but the specifics are far odder, not to mention riskier within a blockbuster Netflix is surely hoping will be watched by the whole family over the holiday season. It doesn't work entirely, but there's a thrill to seeing a movie operating on this scale that hasn't been sanitized within an inch of its life.

We open on the planet of Veldt, a remote, rural community at the very edge of the universe controlled by the despotic Motherworld government. It's this farming community where Kora (Sofia Boutella) has made her new home after fleeing from the Imperial Army, hoping to start a new life to atone for the sins of her past. But at the start of a crucial harvest season, that peace is threatened by the arrival of the army, who want to be given significant crops to help keep them fed and ready for battle at the galaxy's outer reaches, where they are hunting rebels. With the army intimidating the residents into a no-win situation — either supply them with all their crops, starving the farmers to death, or be killed on the spot — Kora realizes it's time to take action and fight for her adopted home, embarking on a quest across the galaxy to find other rebels who will help defend them from the Imperial fighters once they return.





If ""Star Wars"" was George Lucas' tribute to Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress,"" then ""Rebel Moon"" is Zack Snyder's attempt to make a space opera out of another Kurosawa classic: ""Seven Samurai."" As with his other influences here, the director makes zero attempts to disguise the obvious parallels between both, finding something oddly liberating in laying out the ways he aims to adhere to a tried-and-tested storytelling formula. Naturally, it doesn't hold a candle to such a totemic influence, but it is an effective tribute, with the first act slowly building a sense of unrelenting dread as the farming community faces the biggest existential threat it's ever faced. Once again, the sign that the film was working for me was that I couldn't overlook the story it was mimicking but found myself drawn in and unnerved despite the familiarity.





It should be noted that the specific inciting incident that leads Kora to embark on her revenge mission will reignite a criticism rightfully leveraged at one of Snyder's earlier films, ""Sucker Punch,"" through the way it portrays sexual assault. Like that effort, this isn't an R-rated movie — the bloodlessness of the otherwise effectively staged fight scenes might be the biggest flaw on the whole — but ""Rebel Moon"" is instead a PG-13 attempt at an audience-friendly blockbuster, which means that any attempts to do justice to the portrayal of such a consequential threat feel awkward.

Luckily, there's none of the uncomfortable leering at the female protagonists here, which only made the attempts to allude to similar acts of violence in ""Sucker Punch"" disturbing for all the wrong reasons, but lazily using the threat of sexual violence toward a secondary character as a motivator for the protagonist still left me feeling uneasy. Yes, it directly leads to one of the best-staged fight sequences in the whole movie, but I can't help but feel that could have been set up with a far less intimidating threat if it were going to portray a substantial one this emptily. When a male character is nonconsensually sexually propositioned by an alien later on, it does feel like Zack Snyder acknowledging this criticism but coming up with the wrong solution. Making a male character a victim of sexual assault doesn't make its previous uses as a threat toward female characters any less ill-thought-through. It's used as empty shorthand to justify a character's revenge mission, with little afterthought to the victim.





It's the one aspect of ""Rebel Moon"" that proves jarring. Even the most surreal moments — Corey Stoll as the community's leader is introduced via a monologue encouraging everybody to go have sex to ensure a good harvest season — fit well within this slightly off-kilter take on a recognizable space western. That familiarity is what leads the film to the trait most distinctive of Snyder: how he explores hero worship both within the narrative and as a meta-interrogation of our relationship to such screen archetypes. Following his divisive take on ""Watchmen,"" his DC films (and in particular, his iteration of Superman) mostly operated as examinations of how superheroes are treated as deities within their stories and the complications that arise when treating flawed beings as messiahs. ""Rebel Moon"" isn't as likely to turn off more casual viewers with its approach, but it does still repeatedly pause to make the audience ponder why they unquestionably react to certain archetypes as heroes.





Charlie Hunnam's Kai, a bounty hunter and pilot in the Han Solo mode — albeit with a dreadful Irish accent, the latest addition to the never-ending list of accents he can't pull off — is treated as a cocky, charismatic figure akin to Harrison Ford's beloved character upon arrival. Snyder seems confused as to how a character so clearly in it for himself could have become a defining screen hero, and so he aims to utilize Kai within his narrative as a corrective to that automatic assumption. ""Rebel Moon"" weaponizes your familiarity with ""Star Wars"" and its countless imitators, which proves far more effective at distinguishing this tale than the queasy attempts at grittiness.
It is undeniable that ""Rebel Moon"" can't be judged entirely on the back of this first part, with the cliffhanger making it all but apparent that this story doesn't work without the whole. What I can say is that ""Rebel Moon: Part One — A Child of Fire"" suggests this saga could be one of Snyder's greater blockbuster achievements to date, with thrilling spectacle and enough ingenious twists on a familiar formula that ensure it never feels derivative. There are missteps along the way, but this is a Snyder movie after all — his big swings never completely hit the mark, but there are few directors who would attempt so many within a movie on this gargantuan scale.

"Dec 15, 2023"," The end is just “the start of something,” according to one of the action-figure-deep heroes of “Rebel Moon—Part One: Child of Fire,” the lumbering first half of Zack Snyder’s planned two-part “Star Wars” knockoff. After 133 minutes (give or take seven for credits), Snyder’s latest gang of misfits are finally ready to fight space Nazis. It’s Akira Kurosawa in space again, only this time everything’s rendered with storyboard perfection and a frustrating emphasis on sheer visual scale, despite a general lack of eye-catching details. “Rebel Moon” also only really looks good when it’s focused on things crashing into or flying above other things. Sometimes they hover over and then crash into things, which has its appeal. Unfortunately, none of the fun or affection that likely went into the making of “Rebel Moon” has survived the transition from storyboard to screen, making it harder to care when characters tease viewers with perverse humor—watch out for those tentacles, Atticus!—or aching sincerity. (“Kindness is a virtue worth fighting for”) Heroes like Kora circulate in order to justify prefab epic-ness, but they don’t make “Rebel Moon” move any faster towards its foregone cliffhanger ending. And yet it moves, I guess.  Simon Abrams is a native New Yorker and freelance film critic whose work has been featured in The New York Times, Vanity Fair, The Village Voice, and elsewhere.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Watching Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, I couldn’t help but think about the Wachowskis’ film Jupiter Ascending, the last time both sisters worked together on a feature. Both movies have Djimon Hounsou and Bae Doona in common, and A Child of Fire also features Alfonso Herrera, another Wachowskis vet. Both movies are also primarily exercises in worldbuilding, visiting a succession of planets and hoping audiences are impressed. Unfortunately, while Jupiter Ascending develops its own visual language and action style — those anti-gravity boots! — A Child of Fire shamelessly draws influences from a number of other sources without bothering to come up with a single original idea. The story is familiar. The galaxy is in upheaval after the assassination of a king, and thanks to a power vacuum, The Imperium has risen in his place. They rule the known universe with an iron fist, and rebels only strike back on occasion. When the villainous, fascistic Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) visits a village on an outer moon, planning to return in a few weeks to take their harvest, a mysterious stranger named Kora (Sofia Boutella) inspires the villagers to fight back. To that end, she must build a band of rebels. A rebel alliance, if you will. Kora and her farmer companion Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) head to a nearby port city, where they visit a bar and find a roguish thief (Charlie Hunnam) to serve as their off-world pilot. I don’t even have to make the obvious point, do I? The movie settles into a simple Point A to Point B rhythm as the gang travels from world to world, picking up fighters along the way. One of them even uses swords that light up.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," In our Rebel Moon review, we dig into why the film is Zack Snyder’s most raw and uncompromised project to date. It’s derivative but also a ton of fun! PLOT: In a dark corner of the universe controlled by a Fascist regime called The Motherworld, a former soldier named Kora (Sofia Boutella) tries to escape her past by living as a simple farmer on a peaceful moon called The Veldt. When that moon is invaded by The Motherworld and her friends are threatened, Kora sets off to recruit an army of soldiers to battle with the Motherworld and end their tyranny. REVIEW: Take Star Wars, a liberal amount of Seven Samurai, The Magnificent Seven, and Battle Beyond the Stars, and mix it in with a heavy helping of Heavy Metal (both the magazine and the film), and you end up with Zack Snyder’s Rebel Moon. While a bit overstuffed (Snyder maybe made it a little too lean at just over two hours), it’s nonetheless a deliriously entertaining sci-fi epic that one could easily call the Best Star Wars Movie Never Made. It’s not a stretch to say that Rebel Moon is more fun than anything that has come out of a Galaxy Far, Far Away in quite some time. For a long while, Star Wars, Marvel, and most other big franchises have had the handicap of relying too much on their ever-expanding mythologies. You must do your homework to enjoy the latest Marvel or Star Wars movie or TV series. Not so with Rebel Moon. Everything you need to know is set up in a quick introduction, and Snyder embraces the same simple, direct style of storytelling that made those classics I mentioned earlier in the review so exciting to watch. While some will slam it as derivative, and one can certainly see how it was initially planned as a Star Wars movie, Snyder’s also delivered a pretty damn exciting film. It’s full of slow-motion action, heroes’ journeys (at least seven of them, actually), operatic betrayals, star-crossed romance, and everything else that defines the space opera genre. For about fifteen minutes or so, the lightning-quick pace of the storytelling is a bit overwhelming, and Snyder’s made the fastest-paced movie of his career. Still, by the time the end credits rolled, I was dying to see Part 2, The Scargiver, which Snyder promises is coming sooner rather than later. The movie is anchored by a star-making performance by Sofia Boutella. While she’s been in loads of stuff, she’s never had this kind of showcase. Kora is a classic dark heroine, with her embracing the character’s vulnerability to give her an edge. Often, the problem with heroes in movies these days is that they’re presented as too invulnerable. There’s nothing fun about an action hero that wins every fight. Kora is more from the Sarah Connor or Ripley mold. She’s a badass, but she isn’t physically or emotionally invulnerable. This gives her action scenes extra oomph, as you don’t always know exactly what will happen during them or how she will escape. In Boutella’s movie, she’s surrounded by a solid cast of heroes and villains, all playing these classic archetypes but with a lot of style. Ed Skrein is evil incarnate as Admiral Noble, the right-hand man to the movie’s version of Emperor Palpatine, Fra Fee’s Balisarius, with him leering in delight as he wreaks havoc across the galaxy. Snyder’s movie is definitely more interested in its heroes than villains, though, and the collection he’s assembled here, while very much in the Magnificent Seven mode, is a fun bunch. Michiel Huisman initially plays the wimpiest of the bunch, being a peaceful farmer without any experience in war. He could have been deadly dull, but Snyder gives him solid motivation, as he has an unscrupulous side that inadvertently made his people vulnerable to The Motherworld. He also has a heroic streak that starts to come out as the movie goes on, and Snyder gives him one of the movie’s best badass moments, establishing him as a legit hero for the second film. Staz Nair plays a character heavily patterned on Charles Bronson in Magnificent Seven, while Doona Bae’s Nemesis is much like James Coburn’s character in that same movie. They play heroes with dark pasts that need redemption, with Nair looking like a Frank Frazetta illustration coming to life. Djmon Hounsou steals scenes as a former Motherworld general turned drunk. At the same time, Snyder’s fave Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman play the Bloodaxes, a brother and sister pair who lead a resistance against The Motherworld. Of course, there’s also Charlie Hunnam as the movie’s answer to Han Solo, Kai, an anti-hero whose entrance is a direct riff on the Cantina scene in Star Wars. Sporting a grill and an Irish accent, Hunnam is having a whale of a time playing a charming rogue with dubious motivations beyond cash. Again, it’s an archetype but a well-executed one. Of the entire cast, though, the most intriguing character is one who’s barely featured in this installment but is said to be one of the leads in the next film – a robotic knight named Jimmy. Voiced by Anthony Hopkins and performed by Dustin Ceithamer, he’s part of an ancient order of robots who are no longer able to kill but finds himself able to pull the trigger when needed after developing a paternal interest in a young girl on The Veldt who soldiers attack. Next to Kora, his hero’s quest is the most affecting, and I’m eager to see the director’s cut of this, which has a lot of footage involving the character that was removed to tighten the pace. Visually, the film is impeccably mounted (as long as you like Snyder’s style in the first place). I was lucky enough to see it on a massive theatrical screen, and it feels like Netflix has maybe erred in not giving this a more robust release, given how underwhelming this season’s crop of blockbusters is turning out to be. The score by Junkie XL is suitably epic, and the action scenes are dazzling, with the movie ending on a more satisfying note than the majority of films split in two. While Rebel Moon isn’t perfect because Snyder is perhaps a little too liberal in pulling from his influences to make his space epic, no one can deny how much of a blast it is to watch. Granted, if you’re not already a Zack Snyder fan or don’t like his style, this isn’t the movie for you. But, if you like his work, Rebel Moon is one of his better movies and a nifty start to what could be a very valuable franchise for Netflix.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Zack Snyder pitched Rebel Moon as a marriage of Seven Samurai and Star Wars, which is a bit like trying to sell your new invention as the wheel meets sliced bread. The former channeled all of Akira Kurosawa’s estimable powers in blocking, lighting and composition for battles that still merit the nearly exhausted descriptor of “epic”; the latter was a once-in-a-millennium Big Bang of raw movie stardom, snappy dialogue and transportive production design that turned a mid-budget space oddity into a culture-straddling phenomenon; both are fundamentally impossible to replicate. And so Lucasfilm passed on Snyder’s tall order, as did Warner Bros (more than once), until the good people at Netflix uncinched their readily loosened purse strings for what had gradually become the blockbuster king’s longest-simmering passion project. Yet the finished product has only the vaguest contours of ambition, diminished by a half-assedness dinkifying the latest CGI-jammed saga to decide the fate of the universe. If it can be considered complete at all, that is – this 134-minute film really only covers the getting-the-gang together phase that most movies in the genre knock out within the first half hour, a fragment of story to be wrapped up with a second installment next year. One hopes that Snyder has saved the good stuff for his climactic conclusion, and not just the grand clashes conspicuously absent from an adventure that fits and belongs on a laptop. (Longtime Snyderheads may happen upon the epiphany that his trademark slow-mo action tableaux look like screensavers more than anything else.) There’s still time for him to add character development to his ragtag band of cardboard cutouts, a tactility to his nondescript greenscreened locations, a deeper sense of meaning to the stultifyingly generic plot, and everything else that leaves a sort of polished nothingness in its lack. But by the end credits, expecting anyone to come back and find out feels like asking a lot. In film school, some professors use the familiar example of Star Wars to teach Campbellian mythmaking, the theories that identify and codify the narrative units re-contextualized since Grecian times. Snyder demonstrates a clear fluency in these concepts with his classically minded scripting, except he forgot the part where the archetypes are meant to be refreshed through novel contexts. On the humble farming planet of Wherever in the galaxy of Who Cares, the broad outline of a Hero (Sofia Boutella, terse and humorless and physically perfect, just how Snyder likes ’em) must defend her village from a faraway notion of an Evil Empire. They rose to power in some great cataclysm of yore during which our Hero’s family was killed, and the Final Boss took her in to teach her the combat skills she’d one day use to take her revenge. Snyder mistakes exposition for world-building, the lugubriously delivered reams of backstory removing the audience from the fantasy rather than immersing them in it. To topple the Mini-Boss (Ed Skrein, his British accent and high cheekbones marking him as a baddie) come to appropriate her people’s grain, she and her Sidekick (a neutered Michiel Huisman) bop around the cosmos rounding up sympathizers to their cause, including a self-interested yet caddishly likable mercenary we’ll call Not Han Solo (Charlie Hunnam, more visibly awake than most of his scene partners). They are most easily referred to by their function both because they exist as little more than sketches, and because the muddy sound mix isn’t doing viewers any favors, but especially because their names are often long and difficult to retain. Others are catchier, but never for good reasons. General Titus (Djimon Hounsou) and the squid-faced King Levitica offer arbitrary allusions for which the writing never makes any attempt to account. Some are just silly, like the brother-sister warriors surnamed Blood Axe, or Skrein’s effete colonist answering to Atticus Noble. Despite a few nifty creature designs, the handful of eccentricities never add up to a more colorful sense of personality; a fleshy parasite using its human host as a ventriloquist dummy hangs out in Snyder’s equivalent of the Mos Eisley cantina, but his wretched hive of scum and villainy has the clean interior decor and warm natural light of an upscale sushi restaurant. Even when sci-fi goes horribly awry, it usually yields some memorable weirdness, a tradeoff that’s endeared the likes of Jupiter Ascending or Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets to their self-selecting cults. No such luck in this case, with Snyder’s po-faced sensibility totally bereft of humor, intentional or otherwise. He envisioned the fight for Somewhere-or-Other as his masterpiece, its sprawling cumulative runtime and expansive scope unprecedented in his career. Going mad with power should be at the very least fun, exhilarating in the indulgence of an artist’s most outlandish whims. Instead, Snyder’s would-be magnum opus is merely boring.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire showcases a visually stunning world, a dastardly villain, and a group of rebels that will have your heart. Zack Snyder fans have been waiting forever for Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire, so luckily it was worth the wait. This film builds a truly incredible world with stunning visuals, intriguing characters, and a villain that is sure to send shivers down anyone’s spine. Knowing that a Rebel Moon Part Two is coming can be a little worrisome. Does Part One feel like all set up with absolutely no payoffs? Not at all. Does it end on a cliffhanger that will have you begging for it to be April already? You know it. Official Synopsis: After crash landing on a moon in the furthest reaches of the universe, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a stranger with a mysterious past, begins a new life among a peaceful settlement of farmers. But she soon becomes their only hope for survival when the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) and his cruel emissary, Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), discover the farmers have unwittingly sold their crops to the Bloodaxes (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher) — leaders of a fierce group of insurgents hunted by the Motherworld. Tasked with finding fighters who would risk their lives to defend the people of Veldt, Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), a tenderhearted farmer naive in the realities of war, journey to different worlds in search of the Bloodaxes, and assemble a small band of warriors who share a common need for redemption along the way: Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a pilot and gun for hire; General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a legendary commander; Nemesis (Doona Bae), a master swordswoman; Tarak (Staz Nair), a captive with a regal past; and Milius (E. Duffy), a resistance fighter. Back on Veldt, Jimmy (voiced by Anthony Hopkins), an ancient mechanized protector hiding in the wings, awakens with a new purpose. But the newly formed revolutionaries must learn to trust each other and fight as one before the armies of the Motherworld come to destroy them all. Something most people can agree on is that Zack Snyder knows how to pull off an action scene. Thankfully there are a lot of them in Rebel Moon Part One. In order to have faith that this team of Rebels can pull off taking down the big baddie, we have to see them in action. This is exactly what we get, perfectly sprinkled throughout the movie. Each character has their time to show us what they have, and of course, it is done so beautifully. Snyder’s signature look of dulled tans and browns, with pops of reds and yellows, is very common throughout the film. Let’s just say you won’t be wondering who directed it while watching it. This, of course, is not a bad thing. In fact, if it isn’t broken, why fix it? Exploring this new universe is one of the most exciting things about the Rebel Moon Part One. We see many different planets, and with that different looking inhabitants. There is a fair amount of VFX used, but it mostly hits the mark. The times that it doesn’t often surround CGI animals, which we all know very rarely actually works — especially if someone is riding one.  It is clear that this film is modeled a lot off of Star Wars, which once again, not necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it seems as if this is a vaguely familiar story, but it never fully hits the nail directly on the head. It takes just enough of inspiration while still making it something unique, new, and exciting. Probably the biggest issue with Rebel Moon Part One is that it feels like a set up film. This often happens when there are two parts to a film, but Part One doe this while still delivering a lot of great action and driving the story forward. Yes, there are some consequences for character actions. There are big events. And of course, that massive cliffhanger which is simultaneously annoying but also will leave audiences eager for me. Luckily we only have to wait until April to see what happens next.  Was the movie a longer one and then split in two, or was it always planned this way. It is hard to tell exactly what Snyder’s plan was from the start, but because we meet so many characters, it seems that perhaps it was an overstuffed film that needed more time to breath, so it became two. Because there are so many characters being added to the story as time goes on, the audience doesn’t get to know them well enough to truly connect to them. To root for them. To feel for them.  Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire. (L-R) Charlie Hunnam as Kai, Michiel Huisman as Gunnar and Sofia Boutella as Kora in Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire. Cr. Netflix ©2023. This part is hard to talk about without giving spoilers, but in Rebel Moon Part One there are just a handful of characters that are given enough of a background. Kora and Admiral Noble being two of them. We get to learn a lot about them and their background. Kai and Gunnar also have great stories in the film. Unfortunately, other than that, the characters get a throwaway sentence about their past, a scene as to how they join up with the team, and that is it. Hopefully in Part Two we are able to dive into their personalities more so that we can connect with them. Zack created a captivating universe with his world building, despite the lack of character building for some. The plot is intriguing, but we won’t know until Part Two comes out if it is all worth it in the end. That being said, the action is great, the visuals are stunning, and there are certain characters that will have your heart.  We love a good villain, so we are thrilled with how Ed Skrein portrays Admiral Noble. He is ruthless. He is diabolical. And he is someone you will love to hate. While he certain feels like an Imperial Officer, he also brings his own twist to things. One of the best villains to grace the screen in a long time, he is sure to be a fun favorite. Overall, Rebel Moon Part One: A Child Of Fire is definitely a set up for what will hopefully be an epic conclusion. The action is great, the visuals stunning, and the story intriguing. There are a lot of characters that audiences will connect with, but unfortunately also a lot that they just don’t well enough yet. Admiral Noble makes an incredible villain that you love to hate with every fiber of your being, and Kora is a fighter with a surprising past that you will love to root for. After crash landing on a moon in the furthest reaches of the universe, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a stranger with a mysterious past, begins a new life among a peaceful settlement of farmers. But she soon becomes their only hope for survival when the tyrannical Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee) and his cruel emissary, Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), discover the farmers have unwittingly sold their crops to the Bloodaxes (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher) — leaders of a fierce group of insurgents hunted by the Motherworld.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Try as it might, Rebel Moon doesn’t give much life to the sci-fi genre – but it may leave a scar on Zack Snyder’s filmography, earning a rare, dishonorable distinction: it’s dull.  Snyder’s juice speaks for itself: echoing 28 Days Later’s manic runners, he transformed Dawn of the Dead into one of the most effective, exhilarating zombie romps of the 21st century; he brought Alan Moore’s Watchmen to life in breathtaking fashion, managing to capture its zeitgeist-slicing weight before the superhero boom tightened its grip; and for all of its critics, he gave the world a unique take on the Man of Steel, one unburdened by feeble optimism but built on hope (and some of the coolest Superman visuals put to screen).  But he’s also a victim of his own ultra-specific, unavoidable visual style; a gluttony of slick, crying-to-be-screenshotted visuals that evoke awe and little else, and when that jaw starts to close, what’s left but a closed mouth and boredom?  Given his carte-blanche relationship with Netflix, Rebel Moon should have been unfiltered Snyder; all of his worst traits, but everything that makes him an essential voice. Alas, excluding a few gnarly and grin-worthy flourishes, this new franchise is DOA; at its core, it’s ineffectual.  A faraway (but not far, far away) galaxy is governed by the Motherworld, the vengeful government and remnants of the monarchy whose king and princess were slain by a rogue assassin. With the royal bloodline severed forever, the Imperium’s Balisarius (Fra Fee) crowns himself regent in the king’s wake and deploys Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) to the outer reaches to crush “those who call themselves… Rebel.” Meanwhile, Kora (Sofia Boutella), a child of war who escaped endless conflict after crash-landing on a moon, fights to earn peace by farming, smiling, and courting the possibility of love – even though she thinks she doesn’t deserve it. Her sanctuary is soon invaded by an Imperium dreadnought, crashing through its clouds and looming above anything and everything with its enormous gaze. Soon, the villagers find themselves under the admiral’s thumb, forcing Kora to seek out willing warriors across the known universe who can stand against the oppressors. TL;DR: Seven Samurai in space.  Their rallying call takes them all across the cosmos, running into the likes of Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a mercenary enamoured with Kora’s cause, Tarak (Staz Nair), a nobleman-turned-slave with a knack for looking buff and calming animals, General Titus (Djimon Hounsou), a disgraced Imperium general… at least in their eyes, and Nemesis (Doona Bae), a cyborg swordsmith armed with what a friend described as “light-wielders” – but not lightsabers. Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman also appear as burly, super-serious rebel leaders, while Anthony Hopkins voices Jimmy, a royal droid who clearly has a much larger role in the story than we know.  Knowing that Snyder has a longer, harder R-rated cut of Rebel Moon is a curse on the film. An R-rating isn’t a guarantee of quality, and there should be a space for sweeping, bruising action blockbusters on a PG-13 level (The Hunger Games did it) – but here’s the thing: the movie is clearly shot and envisioned as a violent space opera, with action awkwardly, frustratingly neutered in aid of a family-friendly-ish viewing experience, some scattered teeth aside. It feels like watching the TV edit of Saturday Night Fever first – in other words, wrong.  Even the fact that a director’s cut – which will likely be a fuller, more authentic representation of Snyder’s ambitions, for better or worse – exists and has been promoted before the first edit of the film’s release feels like a cheap nod to his loyalists (“if you don’t like this, you’ll love this!”). His infamous Justice League cut is a key chapter of his history behind the camera, but this veers close to defining him in a rather trite way.  That, and the whole story and the majority of its set pieces feel empty and derivative (one sequence, albeit constructed with impressive VFX, is pretty much just a mash of Harry Potter and Avatar), yet its world-building is overwhelming; we hop from world to world with a vague understanding of the stakes (the Empire vs Rebels stuff is impossible to miss), but we meet strange and lightly sketched characters and hear baffling lore that’s filed under “you better remember this later” when we’ve barely grasped it in the first place.  The villains, between Skrein’s baddie who’s somewhere between a Nazi, Peaky Blinder, and Gavin Shipman (admittedly, he has quite a bit of fun with his performance), and the Imperium foot soldiers who threaten rape out of macho boredom, are also just… a bit boring.  While it rarely feels truly immersive, with its often ugly landscapes and enormous VFX backgrounds (one scene of a wheat field looks directly lifted from 300, and not in a good way), there are some incredible effects: a Buckbeak-esque creature is vividly realized, and Hopkins’ Jimmy steals each brief scene he’s in, reminiscent of The Creator’s seamless visual integration of AI bots with ordinary people. There’s a standout scene with a large spider that raises Snyder as a possible candidate for a Soulsbourne movie – keep that in mind.  Boutella, excusing her yawn-infecting dialogue, is a capable and highly watchable lead, but Hunnam is the only star around her capable of meeting the demand; for the most part, this is a movie full of good-looking people who aren’t very interesting to watch, and the script doesn’t do them any favors.  Synder’s eye is a bit tiresome, but you’d be hard-pressed to criticize his cinematography – it’s the editing that’s the problem, with shots in short scenes resembling more of an ooh-and-ahh slideshow than the synergy required for telling an effective story. Fortunately, a trusty collaborator delivers the goods: Junkie XL is on score duties again, and his booming composition – while not especially re-listenable – maintains a much-needed air of grandeur that the movie doesn’t necessarily deserve.  Rebel Moon is just a load of slow-mo stuff you’ve seen before with added melodrama; a pale imitator that fails to forge its own space in the legacy of big-screen sci-fi.  Cameron is Deputy TV and Movies Editor at Dexerto.

"Dec 15, 2023"," With Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, Zack Snyder promised a more “mature” take on Star Wars. Unfortunately, it’s more “Star Wars for people who think those movies are too political and don’t feature enough sexual violence”. The director’s two-part Netflix epic (Part Two: The Scargiver will release in April of next year) stems directly from an old pitch made to Kathleen Kennedy back when she was the co-chair of Lucasfilm, shortly before it was acquired by Disney. It’s a film populated by some of the Zack Snyder’s Justice League filmmaker’s worst impulses: a mess of imagery, some of it attempting to shock, congregated largely around the idea of what might look good in a trailer. Rebel Moon, co-written with Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten, is a Seven Samurai riff in which the space-viking homestead of Veldt is visited upon by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) and the evil Imperium army. What follows is an unnecessarily long debate with farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) about wheat yields. Atticus demands food and submission. Kora (Sofia Boutella), an immigrant to Veldt whose history leads back to the Imperium, decides to fight back. She and Gunnar then potter around the galaxy, collecting weary warriors for the cause: namely Titus (Djimon Hounsou), Kai (Charlie Hunnam), Tarak (Staz Nair), Nemesis (Bae Doona), and Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher). The visits to each of their planets is truncated, since Kora need only yell in their face about “revenge” or “honour”, or defeat a monster, in order to convince them to join the squad and immediately fade into the background. It’s a shame, since Snyder’s always possessed formidable intuition when it comes to actors, and the likes of Boutella, Hounsou and Doona are exactly the kind of talented people who should be fronting major sci-fi vehicles. Fisher, too, especially deserves his moment of triumph, following the racism he allegedly faced from Joss Whedon on the set of Justice League. He’s given one motivational speech here, but it’s delivered barely five minutes after we’ve met him. There’s a lot here that could, theoretically, be solved by the R-rated, director’s cut Snyder has insisted was always a part of the release plan. But why then should audiences have to sit through a two-and-a-bit-hour trailer for a second film that we’ve been pinky-promised is better? Especially when what’s on screen is borderline incoherent? Perhaps I’m being too demanding as an audience member, but when we’re repeatedly told that characters are travelling to a colosseum planet, I would then expect, when we arrive at said colosseum planet, to actually see what’s happening inside the colosseum. In Rebel Moon, they arrive at the entrance, only for the film to immediately cut away to a guy in a room. While there’s sincere cultural value in “stuff that looks cool”, Snyder’s full-throated investment in, say, a slow-mo shot of a shirtless, muscle-bound man leaping onto the back of a gryphon doesn’t entirely excuse him from deeper analysis. Rebel Moon, in that light, has a somewhat baffling ideological outlook. On the one hand, it handily avoids the pitfalls of appropriation by locating each character within a world largely suited to the actor’s own cultural heritage (let’s perhaps exclude Hunnam here, whose Irish accent is about to become infamous). Yet, there’s very little sense of how these planets are united or divided, in a way that becomes particularly troubling when Snyder attempts to locate them within a context in which racist and sexual violence are used as tools of war. This is not the first time Snyder has directly tied female empowerment to sexual assault (see: his 2011 film Sucker Punch, among others). And, despite the film featuring a prominent non-binary character, played by non-binary actor E Duffy, it’s also not the first time a supposed lair of degeneracy has been depicted as explicitly queer-coded (see: his 2006 film 300). Here, the film’s obligatory cantina scene inexplicably seems to feature the cast of Cabaret loitering in the background. Are we meant to be too distracted by the mutant spider-woman or flower crown-wearing robot to notice? Well, it didn’t work – Rebel Moon wears its shambles on its sleeve.",NEGATIVE

The result is (the first half of) a singularly torturous slog that tries — and fails, and fails, and fails again for 134 minutes of agonizing tedium that are only interrupted by the occasional jolt of sadness for the wasted talent of everyone involved — to distill an iota of creative value from pre-existing images that never seemed worthless until Snyder tried to make them unique. It’s the cinematic equivalent of an NFT. At least “Rebel Moon” does Netflix subscribers the courtesy of revealing how bad it is from the moment it begins. Choral wails over the studio logos give way to a dreadnought emerging from a vagina-shaped portal in deep space as Anthony Hopkins’ one-off narration lectures us ad nauseam about an evil Motherworld that’s trying to colonize the galaxy and wipe out every last rebel who might be hiding in its furthest reaches. In no universe should a story this trite require so long to set up, be so hard to follow, or involve so many nonsense words. Backdropped by a massive Jupiter-like planet that makes all of the night scenes look as if they’ve been sand-blasted with a layer of digital Cheetos dust (an orange eyesore of an image that Snyder dotes upon as if staring at it for long enough might create the magic of Tatooine), Veldt is home to a simple community of luddite farmers who just want to work the land in peace. Unfortunately for them, basic grain is every bit as valuable to this hyper-futuristic universe full of crazy alien technology as it was to the famished peasants of 16th century Japan, and so the Motherland’s most sociopathic enforcer (Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble) murders Sindri as a preview of what he’ll do to the rest of the village if they haven’t harvested enough bushels to feed his army when they return in 10 weeks.  Anyway, Kora heads off into the great unknown, alone save for Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), the meek but strapping farmer who’s been fertilizing an obvious crush on this strange woman since the minute she landed on Veldt. We’re meant to believe that his feelings for Kora only deepen after she subjects him to several interminable flashbacks about her past as an orphan who was adopted by the Imperium’s most fearsome general, but there’s so little detail to these characters — and so few moments of meaningful overlap between them — that it’s hard to remember why they’re in the same movie, let alone that we’re supposed to be rooting for them to kiss. Kora’s only two identifiable characteristics are that she’s emotionally scarred and that she wears a sick cape. Sometimes she takes the cape off, and then she’s down to one. That may not be enough of a foundation to support the weight of the narrative universe that Netflix hopes to build on top of her (you typically need at least three characteristics to pull that off), but who knows. Take the one triggered by our heroes’ arrival at the outlaw bar where they meet a mercenary named Kai (Charlie Hunnam, easily the most charismatic non-cape screen presence in the movie). The bar is festooned with Japanese imagery for some reason, and the patrons include a deranged coterie of aliens who epitomize Snyder’s penchant for snazzy details that never cohere into anything bigger than their own discrete coolness (the “Starship Troopers” reject with a kink for telepathic enslavement is a real keeper). And you guys won’t believe this, but one of them — a queer-coded alien monster who looks like a human-pig hybrid covered in tumors — makes an overture of sexual violence towards Gunnar! And yet, the time dilation stuff is so egregious that your mind can wander away from the action in the span of a single kick. I found myself wondering about the reason for Snyder’s ongoing fascination with this technique, which started as a way of turning comic panels into motion paintings before it took on a life of its own in the director’s post-“300” work. Now serving as his own cinematographer, is Snyder so in love with his images that he wants us to savor them for as long as possible, or is it just that he’s so incapable of editing shots together into a sequence greater than the sum of their parts that he would rather focus our attention on the parts at the expense of their sum? Either way, the effect produced by all this speed-ramping is a fitting microcosm of a movie that feels like a million isolated storyboards without a single thing welding them together. I’d love to know more about the tentacle creature that slurps on Ed Skrein’s chest when he’s alone in his room at night, or why he — Skrein, not the tentacle creature — suddenly starts cosplaying as a member of Interpol — the band, not the international police force — in the second half of the movie. I’d love to know if Snyder was making some kind of perverse meta joke by giving Ray Fisher even less to do here than he was given in the theatrical cut of “Justice League,” and if his VFX team simply forgot to animate that one planet ruled by an adorable mollusk king (it’s just a lot of fog and some floating black slabs).

"Dec 15, 2023"," Filmmaker Zack Snyder has become a lightning-rod figure in part for the actual movies he makes and in part for the zealous fandom that  sprouts up around them. The loyalty of those legions may very well be put to the test by Netflix’s “Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire,” Snyder’s new, rather leaden  franchise-hopeful. The second part, whose title, “The Scargiver,” is hinted at in the final moments of “Child of Fire,” will be released in a few months and there are also plans underway for other stories spun off from this newly created sci-fi-fantasy universe. That’s a lot of pressure to put on a single movie, attempting to create a ready-made “Star Wars”-like series with its own internal mythology and iconography, and “Child of Fire” doesn’t bear the burden well. With a screenplay credited to Snyder, Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten from a story by Snyder, the film is too invested in table-setting to be fully enjoyed on its own, at times feeling more like a studio presentation deck than a piece of organic storytelling.  A farming community on a remote moon finds  itself under the thumb of the imperial Motherworld for having sold some of its excess grain to a rebel faction. (Yes, the film’s story is largely motivated by wheat.) A mysterious outsider, Kora (Sofia Boutella), sets off with a handsome but naive local farmer, Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), to assemble a band of fighters to defend their land. An inevitable ragtag group comes together, played by Charlie Hunnam, Doona Bae, Djimon Hounsou, Staz Nair, Cleopatra Coleman, E. Duffy and Ray Fisher. All the while they are pursued by Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), a sadistic emissary of the Motherworld regime. And let’s not forget the robot soldier incongruously named Jimmy, voiced by Anthony Hopkins. As the characters bop from planet to planet, outpost to outpost, there is nothing particularly surprising in either the locations or their adventures. At one point a character jumps from a desert cliff in epic slow-motion to land on a flying creature. Later in the film, a different character jumps from a space dock in epic slow-motion to land on a flying craft. Boutella often has an otherworldly screen presence that makes her perfectly suited for this kind of material, but the fussiness of all that is happening around Kora means that the character and performance never get a chance to breathe and blossom, or to fully come to life. The so-called “Snyderverse” cycle of DC Comics-inspired films — “Man of Steel,” “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Justice League” — sparked controversy for their often unrelenting grimness. With “Rebel Moon,” it feels strange to see a filmmaker presumably freed from the constraints of delivering IP-driven material, only to attempt to create his own generic IP-driven universe instead. As seen in his other movies, “300,” “Watchmen” and “Army of the Dead,” Snyder is at his best when there is a touch of hysterical madness to what he is doing, yet his edgelord impulse toward a sense of in-quotes grit and gloom rarely serves him well. This first installment of “Rebel Moon” plays like the first two acts of a movie, or perhaps more truly as a haphazardly assembled series of episodes. Whether it will all come together in the second part remains to be seen, but “Child of Fire” already feels like too much narrative throat-clearing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Sofia Boutella leads a band of insurgents taking a stand to protect a farming community from the evil empire in the grunge action auteur’s Netflix sci-fi movie. 
	This is a derivative crazy-quilt endeavor loaded with enough plot to plug up a black hole but only the most feebly drawn characters to do the work. Its theme of resistance against oppression is too basic to carry much weight. 
	In case you forgot, this is the guy who redefined gay soft-core porn with the big, dumb slab of ancient Greek battle pulp, 300, and almost everyone here has killer abs. One notable exception is the disgusting jowly blob who hits on Michiel Huisman’s hot farmer Gunnar in a spaceport dive bar full of mercenaries, thugs and freaks, which might invite charges of homophobia if anyone were silly enough to take Rebel Moon seriously. 
	Then there’s the head-clobbering obviousness of a fascist militia enforcing the merciless rule of the Motherworld, controlled since the slaughter of the king by the power-hungry Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee). His emissary is the vicious — wait for it — Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), a sinewy sadist sporting Bolshevik-style outerwear over Nazi-chic black and white, who favors bashing his victims’ skulls in with a staff made from the bone of some ancient creature. 
	The warrior in charge of recruiting insurgents to go up against Noble’s army is Kora (Sofia Boutella), a brooding stranger taken in by a peaceful farming community after crash-landing on the remote moon Veldt. Village chief Sindri (Corey Stoll in an unfortunate beaded beard) has barely finished urging everyone to honor the harvest gods with rabid lovemaking, or “thrusting of hips” as he lustily calls it, when Noble’s hulking warships appear in the sky. 
	The Motherworld contingent descends to discuss the supply of grain for their underfed armies, their negotiations turning nasty as Noble horrifies the assembled farmers with an act of violence and clarifies his demands: “It’s simple. I want everything.” 
	He leaves behind a goon squad to take charge of the crops, and while Kora is preparing to flee, she hears the screams of sweet young villager Sam (Charlotte Maggi) being manhandled. “I’ll turn her from a farm girl to a whore!” declares an especially skeevy brute. In one of the worst bits of rape dialogue in recent memory, the senior officer snatches Sam away from that a-hole underling, bellowing, “I’ll split this sapling myself, and then you can have her. Then you can all have her, mwahahahah!” It’s in moments like this that Snyder confuses menacing with gross. 
	Their first connection is with shady pilot Han Solo, who agrees to transport them on the Millennium Falcon. Oops, sorry, I mean bounty hunter Kai (Charlie Hunnam), who whisks them off on his freighter. Hopping from one planetary outpost to another, Kora and Gunnar win over formidable warriors to help their cause. Among them is an ‘80s calendar model, or something, Tarak (Staz Nair); a lethal swordswoman with fire blades for arms, Nemesis (Doona Bae); a fallen general, Titus (Djimon Hounsou); and an insurgent leader, Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), who heads a rebel army fighting the Motherworld with his sister Devra (Cleopatra Coleman). 
	Along the way, Snyder weaves in plenty of outré sci-fi weirdness, which might seem original if you’re new to the genre. There’s a yucky talking bug right out of Naked Lunch; a spiderwoman (Jena Malone) who’s like a vengeful upgrade on Greek mythology’s Arachne, as seen in the ‘90s Hercules series; and a griffin-like winged beast called a Bennu, which creature whisperer Tarak gets to break in, recalling similar scenes with the Hippogriff in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or the leonopteryx in Avatar. Some jolts of creepiness seem to have been tossed in as random arcana without explanation, notably the leech-like tentacles Noble plugs into his torso for kicks at bath time. 
	Action scenes are serviceable enough but rarely exciting, pumped up with Snyder’s usual tool kit of speed-ramping and slo-mo. But there’s a grimy aesthetic to the movie that becomes ugly and tiresome (the director took on the DP role himself), and the episodic plotting seldom builds enough steam to stop you thinking about other things, like: If there’s no reference to these characters ever having lived on Earth, why does Kai have a thick Irish brogue? And beyond global representation, what’s with the whole hodgepodge of accents, anyway — British, Australian, South African, etc.? 
	Boutella, who reportedly did the majority of her own stunts, acquits herself capably, acing the fight choreography and looking cool in a hooded cloak. Hunnam also gets to show some spark and Bae certainly looks commanding in her all-black kumdo suit. But there’s not much scope for the actors to do anything of interest beyond scowl, fight or look anxious. 
	At least Hopkins got out of it with only voice duties as Jimmy, an android soldier whose fighting days ended with the death of the king. His once-regal armor is reduced to a battered tin-can shell and his military programming has given way to contemplative human feelings. When young Sam recognizes the robot’s kindness early on and crowns him with flowers, it sparks Jimmy’s final rejection of Motherworld doctrine.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," 
	The story begins on Veldt, a moon of what looks like a fusion of Jupiter and Saturn (the planet looms in the background like a weirdly artificial piece of wallpaper), where Kora is part of a hearty community of medieval farmers who live in the shadow of the Motherworld. The Motherworld’s king and queen have been assassinated and replaced by vicious autocrats, who want to crush the pocket of insurgents known as the Bloodaxes. The good farmers of Veldt have sold some of their grain to the Bloodaxes, and early on they’re invaded by a Motherworld brigade led by Atticus Noble, an evil admiral who specializes in face-to-face terrorism. The British actor Ed Skrein, in his fascist-with-bangs haircut, is the best thing in the movie. He’s like Rami Malek playing Jim Carrey as Darth Vader as a Nazi out of “Cabaret.” 
	Kora has a thorny and rather turgid backstory (after her family was killed, she was adopted as a daughter by the Motherworld’s ominous overseer). But now, as a resident of Veldt, it’s up to her to travel to distant planets — a great many of them — to gather up…a fellowship of rebel fighters! The movie is episodic in the extreme. Here’s another planet, here’s another Colorful Character to recruit for the team, here’s another slow-mo interlude of ultraviolent combat. 
	Snyder, who shot the film himself, stages it on an impressively lavish scale (all the CGI sprawl a budget of $166 million can buy), and a handful of the episodes are fun, like one where the noble hunk Tarak (Staz Nair) frees himself from indentured servitude by harnassing a giant blackbird who’s like a Ray Harryhausen creature. Sofia Boutella, as Kora, holds the film together with her dour ferocity, and Djimon Hounsou (as the fallen but still noble General Titus), Charlie Hunnam (as the mercenary starship pilot Kai), and Anthony Hopkins (as the voice of Jimmy the droid, who’s like C-3PO with more acting talent) make their presence felt. Yet “Rebel Moon,” while eminently watchable, is a movie built so entirely out of spare parts that it may, in the end, be for Snyder cultists only.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Having spent a large chunk of his career working for Warner Bros on tentpole DC movies, director Zack Snyder has finally made his longed-for version of Star Wars for Netflix – if only it were half as original. It’s unfortunate for fan filmmakers that George Lucas’ Skywalker saga has defined the space opera franchise so fully for nearly 50 years, but Snyder’s overblown effort – which started life as a Star Wars pitch draft – really struggles to break out from under its long shadow. The similarities are hard to ignore when it comes to the $150million (£117.5m) film’s (officially known as Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire) combination of spaceships, far flung planets, exotic space creatures and evil imperial overlords. Rebel Moon is a passion project for Snyder that has been 30 years in the making – and it shows. Much as there may be commendable detail in his universe building, it also smacks of stitched-together set pieces and visuals that he’s had rattling around in his head all this time. It feels like shots that look cool are included purely for the sake of looking cool and obviously, knowing Snyder, in slow-mo – seeds scattering from a hand, blood splattering from a punch and so on. There’s even a mechanised protector robot wearing antlers – as on the poster – who appears again at the end of the movie with his new accessory and… no real explanation? Having said, Sir Anthony Hopkins has lent his dulcet tones to this robot, Jimmy, in an example of inspired casting. Overall, the acting is pretty good, thanks to an able if sprawling cast that also includes Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou, Ed Skrein, Michiel Huisman, Cleopatra Coleman, Justice League’s Ray Fisher and Doona Bae. Boutella goes all in with her interpretation of Kora as a quietly tortured yet ripped action hero, and it’s refreshing to to see her presented as the capable saviour on a planet inhabited by farmers – while Huisman is her pining and naïve arm candy. Also, Ed Skrein must be commended for eviscerating the scenery, never mind chewing it, as the psychotic and villainous Admiral Atticus Noble, who sometimes feels like the only thing powering the movie aside from ambitious action sequences. Rebel Moon was conceived in two parts, with sequel The Scargiver already lined up for a 2024 release, and A Child of Fire absolutely suffers from part one syndrome, not least because there are many supporting characters who clearly have detailed backstories (like Bae’s Nemesis and Staz Nair as regal captive Tarak) but are yet to get their fair share of screen time. Only Hounsou’s General Titus seems to break free from the confusing pack, and that’s mainly due to his past connection to Kora. Hunnam is also on hand as Rebel Moon’s Han Solo, roguish mercenary and pilot Kai, who has bags of charm – but also a distractingly bad Irish accent that only really makes sense later on, if we’re being generous. Be warned, the movie also has an uncomfortably protracted scene threatening gang rape. Snyder has been criticised before for including sexual violence in many of his female characters’ pasts and presents, and, even if it’s meant to be from an educational standpoint, in the context of this glamorously gung-ho and brutal world he’s created, it doesn’t appear that that lesson is necessarily obvious. Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire is a true Snyder spectacle with its visual engagement. If you like his distinct style, you’ll be pleased, and the passion and detail for his new cinematic universe is evident. However, a messy execution with some questionable moments and a lack of focus drags down its promise. With The Scargiver already reportedly wrapped filming, and Rebel Moon 3 currently being written by Snyder, we’ll just have to hope that this disappointing first part is groundwork for bigger and better films in the franchise. Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire hits select UK cinemas on Friday, December 15 before streaming exclusively on Netflix from December 22.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Rebel Moon could have been many things before it landed at Netflix as a space opera in two parts: After director Zack Snyder pitched Lucasfilm on his idea for a Star Wars trilogy, he considered spinning his sprawling sci-fi concept into a TV series, and then a video game. The derivative and awkwardly stitched storytelling from Snyder and co-writers Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hatten in Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire suggests they should have stuck to either one of those previously explored avenues. Introducing a completely original space odyssey is no easy feat, especially given how deeply the established canon permeates our culture. Rebel Moon is very clearly a rejected Star Wars script, but as George Lucas stole considerably from Frank Herbert's Dune, you can somewhat forgive how much it both narratively and visually borrows from that universe. Still, the patchwork script takes so much else from the likes of Blade Runner, The Matrix, Seven Samurai, Dark City, Conan the Barbarian, Excalibur, hell, even Snyder's own films, it's disappointing that it never accomplishes anything quite so enticing, erudite, or bloody. The story kicks off with some rudimentary context narrated by Anthony Hopkins' mechanical knight, Jimmy. He describes a universe governed by brutal totalitarianism and, in an echo of Isaac Asimov's Foundation, a corrupt feudal power based on the mysterious Motherworld that has ruled ""for a thousand kings."" That is until the reigning monarch (Cary Elwes), his wife, and their mystical daughter, Princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald), are murdered, supposedly by insurgents. A power vacuum makes way for Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), leader of Motherworld's army (the Imperium) to take over. It’s an info dump that might have been engaging if there were more to it than watching a phallic-shaped dreadnought cruising through space. The ship carries the Regent's fearsome admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) around the universe to pillage, steal, and colonize worlds as well as quell any uprisings against the Empire – sorry, the Motherworld. A cross between Darth Vader and the maniacal SS Commander Göth from Schindler's List, Skrein has fun as this murderous commander with a scary club, gaunt look, clipped English accent, and a penchant for squeamish, shall we say, pampering rituals. On the moon of Veldt, a sex-positive, Northwest European-coded farming community is minding their own business and ""making love for the harvest"" when Noble arrives with the Imperium to violently occupy their lands. The villagers' surprise and ignorance about the barbaric power on their doorstep is somewhat confusing, given ol' Jimmy's narration: If the royal family have been ruling with an iron fist for centuries, this naiveté is misplaced. Kora (Sofia Boutella), a high-ranking member of the Imperium who went AWOL, has been hiding out on Veldt and so takes it upon herself to gather a team of fighters from across the galaxy to protect her adopted home. She brings nice guy farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) along for the ride, and in between locating their target warriors, he becomes Kora's receptacle for an outlandish amount of exposition and backstory that still manages to leave quite a few gaps. This strong female protagonist is pretty much a facsimile of the MCU’s Gamora, but Boutella showcases a perceptive ability to flit between formidable power, quiet charm, and palpable vulnerability. And that’s despite the cheesy dialogue: You can just imagine lines like ""kindness is a virtue worth dying for"" and ""guilt is the underbelly of honor"" being printed on bumper stickers. In one early scene, Kora takes out several Imperium soldiers to protect a young woman from gang rape. That Snyder relies once again on sexual violence as a plot device to signal a woman's empowerment is rather revolting. Maybe if the choreography and camerawork matched Boutella's talents, the catalyst for this fight wouldn't leave such a bad impression. But throughout the film, the framing and editing of action sequences appear cramped, lackluster, and uninspired. Snyder's signature god-like upshot angles and slow-mo battle visuals make a few appearances, but never live up to highlight-reel clips like the opening fight of Watchmen or Baby Doll’s tussle with the Samurai Giants in Sucker Punch. Jimmy the robot is an excellent use of CGI, but isn't in it enough. Rebel Moon otherwise retains the sludgy, desaturated palette from Snyder’s DC films – brightened only by a colour motif of orange. Even with a slew of fantastical worlds on display, limited locations and time spent on each planet mean the first half of Rebel Moon struggles to make good on its promise of an elaborate universe with a unique mythic lore – instead its racialized civilizations feel too close to home. The five warriors Kora recruits get similarly superficial treatment. The introductions of topless nobleman Tarak (Staz Nair) and cyborg swordmaster Nemesis (Doona Bae) involve mythic beasts, though the former has too much in common with Harry Potter meeting Buckbeak in Prisoner of Azkaban. Starship pilot Kai (Charlie Hunnam), ex Imperium general Titus (Djimon Honsou), and freedom fighter Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher) are also afforded minimal time to understand their characters on a deeper level. Rebel Moon: Part Two - The Scargiver might just do some of them justice, but after two hours of mediocre world-building, pedestrian storytelling, and a rather run-of-the-mill climactic battle, there’s very little incentive to return to this far, far away galaxy. Despite a great ensemble cast, Zack Snyder's space opera is let down by a derivative patchwork script, mediocre action sequences, and a superficial story that fails to live up to its expansive promise.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023"," There's something insidious about a bad movie that has a lot of bonkers stuff in it. In the words of Admiral Ackbar, who is not in this Star Wars ripoff, ""It's a trap."" Because you'll hear about all the odd baubles of Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, and no matter how much I warn you that they are thrown together in a dull and frustrating way, you won't believe me.  Jena Malone as a vengeance-seeking spider woman? Charlie Hunnam as a hipster douchebag space pirate? A burly prince who hates shirts so much you might assume his parents were murdered by them? A robot named Jimmy who is voiced by Anthony Hopkins? A ripped villain who loves Nazi aesthetics and tentacle porn with equal measure? ""What's not to love?"" I hear you wondering. So, so much! Truly, Netflix's latest ploy at big-budget genre thrills is nowhere near as fun or daring as bad-but-good movies like Winter's Tale, Jupiter Ascending, or even Cats. Worst of all, it's boring. Originally pitched to Lucasfilm as a Star Wars movie and understandably rejected, Zack Snyder's Rebel Moon trods very familiar terrain, beginning with a humble but hot farmer who — despite their reluctance — is destined to be a major figure in the rebellion against a fascist interplanetary regime. While the names and lingo have been changed to avoid lawsuits, this movie still feels so close to George Lucas's copyrighted universe that Snyder is practically daring Disney's legal team to sue.  Rather than an opening crawl, Rebel Moon lays out its exposition dump in a long voiceover from Jimmy (Hopkins), who explains that an evil empire is gobbling up the resources of unsuspecting planets while smacking down rebels that work to stop them. Then, Snyder plops us down on a vulnerable world of dirt farmers, where a stern-browed Kora (Sofia Boutella) warns her neighbors not to trust the soldiers whose massive ship has begun ominously hovering above their fields. Sound familiar?  Deadpool villain Ed Skrein comes on the scene as Admiral Atticus Noble, and from his SS-like military gear to his menacingly sharp smile, he is clearly anything but. His army of invading baddies predictably bring violence, but because this is Snyder's version of Star Wars, they also bring a very clear threat of rape. There's a crass and tedious sequence where every soldier but one giddily gears up to sexually assault a local girl (Charlotte Maggi), who might have a name but is chiefly defined by being beautiful while carrying water.  Thankfully, Kora and some unlikely allies stop this assault through battle. However, to defeat the reinforcements sure to come, the peaceful villagers need to bring warriors to their defense. So, Kora and Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), one of the hot farmers who has a crush on her, set out to round up a crew. That process makes up most of the movie, roping in familiar figures like a disgraced general called Titus (a criminally underused Djimon Hounsou), disillusioned samurai Nemesis (Doona Bae), the imposing but actually noble revolutionary Darrian Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher), the aforementioned shirtless prince called Tarak (Staz Nair), and Kai (Charlie Hunnam), a space pirate who's like if Han Solo came from Girls' version of Brooklyn.  It's not just the archetypes of its heroes and villains that borrow hard from Star Wars. It's also the requisite cantina scene with quirky alien critters, the vaguely Western plotline with sci-fi flair, the gentlemanly droids (which won't be called droids), and the lightsabers that might be generously relabeled as laser cutlasses.  From there, Snyder just heaps in other influences, ranging from the spear-versus-spaceship play of Avatar to the names in Legend of Korra to the fashion of Vampire Hunter D and the psycho-sexual tube-play of 1984's Dune. And while the too-muchness of all that might have made for an exciting and rich pastiche, there's so little connective tissue between these things that Snyder's vision instead feels like a lazy collage, stealing from richer, original genre works.  While the influences are as varied as the settings in this universe-trekking war drama, all of it is painted with Snyder's signature color scheme. Grim grays and greens coat empty fields, a bustling port city, spaceships, and palaces. Accents of orange and red come in sweeps of violence, from explosions to the swath of a red lightsaber — sorry — laser cutlass. This color scheme flattens these worlds, as does Snyder's grating reliance on CGI backdrops that feel false, even when Snyder's cinematography is otherwise picturesque.  Remember when Annie Leibovitz shot those rapturously elegant cover photos of the Star Wars cast for Vanity Fair? Those seem to be a major influence for Rebel Moon, not only in how Snyder stages his wide shots, with a seriousness and beauty befitting a perfume ad, but also in how he casts his heroes. From 300 and Sucker Punch to Man of Steel and Batman v Superman, Snyder not only favors his cool color palette but also a cast that looks ripped from runways and the pages of fashion magazines. Yes, this makes for a very pretty picture — sometimes even an awe-inspiring one. But in Rebel Moon, this is arguably more jarring than usual. Where Star Wars movies are certainly full of beautiful people, there are also plenty of characters who feel fairly ordinary, which helps ground a universe full of humans and every kind of alien, from sultry to Sarlacc to Jabba the Hutt.  However, in Rebel Moon, the characters are either gorgeous or grotesque. So, when Kora scans the cantina, Hunnam's meticulously groomed thief is a sharp contrast to a handsy alien who appears to be made entirely of boils. (Props to the actor under the prosthetics — he was a hoot!) This disparity becomes downright comical, as even a character literally introduced covered in mud and shit will get a glamorous makeover between scenes. It's a Snyder movie. No one can go into battle without being ripped and polished.  Maybe if Snyder's work showed some self-awareness of this grim-glossy aesthetic, it might work. But true to form, Moon Rebel is doggedly stern in its tone, forcing its heroes into the constraints of brooding and battle-crying while gorgeous. It's the same suffocating constraint Disney put on its 2000s princesses, limiting their facial expressions in the name of pretty. And all that makes for a film that, despite a barrage of influences, settings, and action sequences, feels flat and emotionally hollow.  Thankfully, not every character in this space odyssey falls into the prim framing of stunning while so serious. Pacific Rim's Charlie Hunnam is a deranged delight as Kai, who — though undeniably a smokeshow — piles on an Irish accent with a slew of red-flag accessories, including a man bun, a Darren Aronofsky-worthy scarf, silver chain, and what appear to be denim joggers. From the moment he sidles up to Kora at the cantina, he oozes with fuckboi charm. That energy feels chaotic in Snyder's somber setting, which makes every moment Hunnam has on-screen exciting. Where much of the movie is predictable, his sparking charisma brings fun and spontaneity. But like many of the most intriguing characters in Rebel Moon, his role is too brief.  Elsewhere, Corey Stoll is jolly as a fatherly village leader. Anthony Hopkins is absurd yet amusing as a cerebral battle bot. Cloud Atlas's Doona Bae is superb as Nemesis, a dual-fisted swordsperson who lands the film's best scene opposite The Hunger Games Jena Malone. While Bae follows the Snyder aesthetic of facial stoniness, her eyes carry remorse as she enters a fight where no one really wins. Meanwhile, Malone is near unrecognizable as a spider-human hybrid, made believable through superb special effects.  Yet from behind all of these disturbing visual enhancements, Malone delivers a gutting performance that speaks volumes, with spitted deliveries and a snarl. This sequence, set midway through the building-the-crew stage of the film, was so rich in its storytelling — from setting up the conflict on a mining planet to establishing the moral code of Nemesis — that I began to have hope Rebel Moon might pull out of its tedious tailspin. Sadly, it did not.  Instead, the movie lumbers on from one introduction of a warrior to another, bouncing sporadically back to Skein's villain, who is either relaxing with tubes and tentacles or switching to a boring shirt and tie for the film's anti-climactic showdown. The world-building is done in fits of heavy exposition. And sure, you know this story won't be complete because ""Part 1"" is in the title. But you won't believe how incomplete it is. We're not talking Fast X or Spider-Man: Across the Spider-verse, where plenty of story, character-building, and stakes are set up to thrill us before teasing an even bigger final battle in the future movie. Instead, the team gets built, has one skirmish, and then the movie is over, with a confounding leap of logic from its surviving heroes. Snyder piles on some flashy while flummoxing imagery and last-minute exposition to set up his Part 2. But after this movie spends two hours and 15 minutes poorly establishing its characters while ripping off Star Wars more than making its own space, it's really near impossible to care.  Kristy Puchko is the Film Editor at Mashable.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Zack Snyder never does anything by halves. But even by his standards, the first part of his long-gestating space saga is a thunderous, portentous, gargantuan slab of mythological sci-fi fantasy.  Initially conceived as a Star Wars spin-off, this epic re-do of Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai takes a standard 'getting the band together' scenario and elevates it to extravagantly operatic heights, albeit at the cost of any leavening impishness or drollery. A sonorous voiceover from Anthony Hopkins – later revealed to be the voice of an aging robot – establishes the universe where Rebel Moon unfolds: a once-benign autocracy now plunged into discord by the slaying of a benevolent king.  Desperate to assert their authority, the forces of the Motherworld touch down on the placid satellite Veldt and demand its citizenry of peace-loving farmers surrender their entire harvest. But what the nasty Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) doesn’t know is that one of his own, runaway warrior Kora (Sofia Boutella), has made Veldt her home and is not about to let her new pals get picked on. With farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) in tow, Kora sets off across the galaxy to find a posse of freelance fighters who’ll repel Noble’s next visit: a rag-tag team of mercenaries that each gets introduced with an elaborate action set-piece. The pick of these is the fiery duel swordswoman Nemesis (Doona Bae) has with child-snatching spider-lady Harmada (Jena Malone) on the mining planet Daagus, a satisfying mini-movie in its own eerie right.  Elsewhere, however, things tend towards the goofy. A sequence in which hunky ironmonger Tarak (Staz Nair) wins his freedom by taming a griffin recalls nothing so much as Harry’s adventures with Buckbeak in Prisoner of Azkaban. It all ends with a dramatic reversal straight out of the Empire Strikes Back playbook that brings things to an explosive if inconclusive conclusion – the inevitable price of A Child of Fire being a scene-setting prelude for a second installment (Part Two: The Scargiver) that will doubtless tie up the various loose threads left frustratingly dangling here.  However, fans of Snyder’s heightened brand of stern, muscular filmmaking won’t be left wanting. And while the performances rarely extend beyond two-dimensional archetype, there’s still fun to be had with Charlie Hunnam’s insouciant turn as a wily pilot of the Han Solo school.  Rebel Moon Part One - A Child of Fire is in selected US and UK cinemas on December 15 before coming to Netflix on December 22.  Neil Smith is a freelance film critic who has written for several publications, including Total Film.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Muscle pumps are to Zack Snyder what murder was to Alfred Hitchcock, so it should come as no surprise that his new science-fiction fantasy epic unfolds in a galaxy far, far away where everybody has enormous arms. The often awkwardly familiar Rebel Moon started life as an official Star Wars project at Lucasfilm before Snyder hauled it over to Netflix, sans franchise branding but with an estimated $150 million price tag, making it the streamer’s costliest 2023 release. And around its many nods to and cribs from George Lucas’s 1977 classic, the Man of Steel and Army of the Dead director’s own proclivities remain bulgingly apparent.  There’s a restless young farmhand of momentous secret parentage; a fascistic superpower whose venerable leader’s right-hand man is a murderous loose cannon; a scoundrel with a battered old spacecraft who turns up in a rough-and-ready cantina to fly our heroes off-world. And every man jack of them has apparently been on the Magic Mike regime, pounding away on the pec deck and scoffing 15 chicken breasts a night. Charlie Hunnam’s rakish bounty hunter Kai has such spectacular shoulders he should have really been named Han Swole-o, while even the droid voiced by Anthony Hopkins has thighs that would have made C-3PO swoon into his oil bath. To be clear, all of this is marvellous: rockin’ bods is the one area in which Rebel Moon seems to have a vague idea what it wants to do. Otherwise this first half of Snyder’s diptych (the second is due in the spring) is more of a loosely doodled mood board than a functioning film – a series of pulpy tableaux that mostly sound fun in isolation, but become numbingly dull when run side by side. That even after a reported 20 years in the making the film still feels fundamentally pointless isn’t just disappointing, it’s entirely bewildering. The method was Bonsai; the outcome cress in an egg cup. If the film too often feels like an uninspired Lucas homage, that is at least partly because it draws inspiration from many of the things Lucas was himself homaging, from Akira Kurosawa’s samurai films to Frank Herbert’s Dune novels, and Frank Frazetta’s lush and lurid comic book and LP covers. (One of the better sequences involves Staz Nair’s shirtless barbarian prince straddling a hippogriff – a Heavy Metal magazine illustration come to life.) However, knowing that doesn’t actually stop the film from just feeling like own-brand Star Wars with extra scowls. Sofia Boutella stars as Kora, whom we meet ploughing fields on the Viking-esque moon of Veldt. Shortly after this, a grim run-in with the Empire – sorry, the Imperium – prompts her to pull together a rag-tag team of revolutionaries, or ‘rebel alliance’ if you will, who can help loosen the baddies’ grip on her humble home world. Some of the many ensuing shootouts and beatdowns have a certain Warhammer 40,000-like glowering charm. But Snyder’s usually sleek aesthetic is disappointingly murky here, with one gloomy planetary backdrop blending soggily into the next. The one dependable bright spot is Ed Skrein’s mad-eyed villain, Atticus Noble: think Rik Mayall in SS getup, bonking his foes on the battlefield with a mahogany femur. Fortunately he appears to be coming back next time, so if Snyder finds him an Adrian Edmondson we might be in business.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 15, 2023"," Make it through the entirety of Netflix’s new sci-fi adventure Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire, and you’ll be greeted with the five most horrifying words in the English language: “Director of Photography: Zack Snyder.” After his studio career of machismo excess and sepia stylism ground to a halt in the wake of his departure from Justice League, the man behind Man of Steel and Watchmen was resurrected by the powers that be at Netflix. After shooting and lensing 2021’s Army of the Dead for the streamer, he produced its prequel, Army of Thieves, while working on Rebel Moon, a two-part movie he’d really like to see as a sprawling multimedia franchise. It would be great to report that the first installment, Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire, heralded a bold new sci-fi epic storming onto the scene. But everyone save for the #ReleaseTheSnyderCut diehards would be better off immediately ejecting this turgid whimper of a movie into the farthest reaches of the galaxy. I’ll admit I went into my screening with a bit of masochistic glee, ready to be shoved into the usual Snyder-orchestrated blender of digitally enhanced fight sequences, slo-mo, and bared heroic abs. I’m not immune to the charms of this polarizing auteur’s filmography: For all his faults, he’s been one of the only superhero-movie directors actually attempting to bring the visual language of comic books to the big screen. For every 10 ponderous, bombastic moments of drudgery in his oeuvre, he’s offered at least one grace note of magnificently realized splash-page maximalism. It wasn’t outside the realm of possibility that he’d deliver a space fantasy with the right kind of pop-art flair. Alas, left to his own devices — and without a collaborative DP to bring his flights of fancy to dramatic, heavily aestheticized life — A Child of Fire is not only a bore, it’s a shoddy-looking one. Even though this is a movie featuring Corey Stoll sporting a thick brogue and braided beard, Anthony Hopkins voicing a kindly robot that wears a cute little crown of flowers, and Doona Bae fighting a murderous spider-lady played by Jena Malone, the results are still surprisingly dull. It’s a tedious parade of character introductions and planet hopping that’s so nakedly beholden to the Star Wars franchise that its greatest tension is in whether there will be an eleventh-hour reveal of Baby Yoda. The plot, such as it is — scripted by Snyder and two of his past writing partners, Shay Hatten and Kurt Johnstad — centers on a farm girl with a mysterious past, because that’s how it went with Luke Skywalker. When her home planet is invaded by the Imperium, the army of the dictatorial Motherworld, Kora (Sofia Boutella) must flee and assemble a band of warriors to combat the forces of evil, Seven Samurai style. She teams up with a roguish scoundrel she meets at an alien cantina (Charlie Hunnam, lilting so much, you fear he’ll take flight), and a potential love interest with ties to the rebellion (Michiel Huisman, one of two Daario Naharis actors on hand). There’s a shadowy Palpatine-esque figure, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), and a typical stuffed-shirt Space Nazi called Atticus Noble, played by Ed Skrein. He’s the type of mincing henchman who whispers, “You’re free,” to a hostage, just before stabbing them in the neck. Y’know, bad-guy stuff. To be fair, Snyder has never been our greatest architect of interiority. His takes on Clark Kent in Man of Steel or King Leonidas in 300 are more about iconography than depth. A generous way to phrase it would be that he trades in archetypes, while a more critical lens might suggest his characters are little more than action figures for him to toss around at will on battlefields. In a movie with one or two chief characters, this might at least be a passable way to proceed. But as his ensemble grows, the already faint character sketch of Kora recedes. The two more intimate moments she is given are arbitrarily placed bits of exposition dumping about her past, illustrated by a series of overwrought, gauzy flashbacks. When Snyder cuts back to Kora, she states helpfully, “I’m only telling you this so you know who I am.” The warriors Kora assembles to defend her home don’t have much characterization, either. Kora flies from planet to planet collecting them; meanwhile, they’re each given one scene to show who they are. (For the most part: They’re fighters who fight.) But most of Part One’s run time has been exhausted by the time the gang is finally assembled, and a final battle does little to demonstrate what their individual talents bring to the table. The genericness feels like a mere annoyance when it relates to the bare-chested Tarzan-esque blacksmith Tarak (Staz Nair) or Furiosa wannabe Devra Bloodaxe (Cleopatra Coleman). But when Snyder casts two-time Academy Award nominee Djimon Hounsou as a character named General Titus, only to utterly waste him, the thinness of the script feels like a glaring problem. And Sense8 star Doona Bae, playing Nemesis, a cyborg in Elphaba chic, instantly conjures up memories of the far more gonzo, soulful, poetic space operas created by Lana and Lilly Wachowski.  Alas, Snyder isn’t the Wachowskis, nor is he George Lucas. Here, the force he most closely resembles is his own creation, Balisarius, the fascistic über-villain who is said to relish nothing more than the “ecstasy of combat.” This should come as no surprise for the man who made 300 and Sucker Punch, but even those films’ action sequences might bristle at the level of visual ineptitude in Snyder’s Child of Fire cinematography.  The combat is hack and slash, rinse and repeat, as Snyder goes from fast to slow motion — and on one occasion, from slow motion to slower motion. Whether we’re on the world of Veldt or Gondeval, whether the combatant is massive mercenary Darrian Bloodaxe or the lean and lithe Tarak, the fighting style is the same, the bloodless carnage the main concern. After one fight scene, Nemesis solemnly tells Kora, “Do not celebrate this. There is no honor in this.” But despite the joylessness on display, we’re always aware of the subtext: Snyder loves making guns go pew and spaceships go boom. The director’s juvenile streak extends to an early scene involving the attempted sexual assault of a minor character, the kind of cheap “rape as the denotation of villainy” trope I’d hoped we’d left behind in season 5 of Game of Thrones. If that doesn’t do it for you, there’s also a predatory gay alien creep who gets his comeuppance when Hunnam shoots him in the back of the head, a shocking bit of homophobia from a filmmaker whose camera fixates on the male form more than most softcore gay porn. The best that can be said about Snyder is that he’s at least capable of a kind of manic brouhaha that’s not unbecoming in this kind of genre filmmaking. Despite the lack of character or emotion in his films, he certainly can be one of the best filmmakers at capturing the pure excess of a piece of lurid fantasy art, or the distinct flair of a Frank Miller drawing. But in Child of Fire, the results couldn’t even be called stylish. The CGI seems to degenerate as the running time goes on. The production and costume design had this Dune agnostic bumping that film up half a star on Letterboxd. And Tom Holkenborg’s score sounds like Space Enya. It’s a bummer to have to dunk so hard on a brand-new piece of fantasy nerddom, delivered just in time for the holidays. But try as he might, Snyder just can’t match the archetypal sincerity or the outlandish imagination of the films he’s trying to emulate here. Child of Fire may not be his worst film, but it’s certainly his least inspired. Thanks to those five scary words in the end credits, it’s also his worst-looking. Part Two: The Scargiver is set to be released in April 2024. What fresh hell awaits us then? ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Those impatient for a new Star Wars film may be excited about the prospect of Rebel Moon, in which director Zack Snyder echoes some of that franchise’s most memorable tropes — albeit without ever coming close to recapturing their magic. The first instalment of a two-part picture serves up Snyder’s usual operatic excess in the story of a ragtag gang of rebels trying to vanquish an evil empire. But nostalgia only takes this dreary space opera so far, and it lacks the indelible characters and riveting adventure that made George Lucas’s blockbusters so resonant. Netflix releases Rebel Moon, subtitled A Child Of Fire, in US and UK theatres on December 15, with the film coming to the streaming platform a week later. (The finale is expected next year.) The ensemble features Sofia Boutella, Charlie Hunnam, Michiel Huisman and Djimon Hounsou, but Snyder (300, Batman V Superman) is probably the biggest draw — with the film’s clear Star Wars homages coming a close second. Reviews will probably not be glowing, but genre fans seeking something this holiday season could be pleased. On a faraway moon, a peaceful community of farmers lives off the land while trying not to attract the attention of the menacing galactic government The Motherworld. But when ruthless Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein) pays a visit, demanding that they surrender their crops, a resourceful, mysterious outsider named Kora (Boutella) dispatches Noble’s troops, showing off her incredible fighting skills. Alongside the meek farmer Gunnar (Huisman), she quickly gathers different warriors from across the universe — including the charming rogue Kai (Hunnam) and the disgraced General Titus (Hounsou) — to battle The Motherworld.  Snyder has not hidden the fact that he unsuccessfully pitched an earlier version of Rebel Moon to Lucasfilm shortly after Disney acquired the company. Most will spot Star Wars’ clear influence, whether it is in the Han Solo-esque Kai, the lightsaber-like weapons wielded by Bae Doona’s accomplished swordswoman Nemesis or the design of the spaceships. The difference, however, is that Snyder applies his more flamboyant visual style and darker tone, which makes this project grimmer and more adult than Lucasfilm fare. Unfortunately, there is not much ingenuity or inspiration to Snyder’s vision. Even its portrait of a cruel fascist government — Skrein plays Noble as a repugnant alt-right monster, complete with Nazi haircut — seems drawn more from older genre villains than it does from modern-day evils across the globe. It has been four years since The Rise Of Skywalker, but since then Disney has continued to produce streaming series built around the venerable franchise. Amidst that glut, Rebel Moon feels especially redundant — neither a radical rethinking of this narrative terrain nor a dazzling illustration of why the original films remain beloved.  Instead, Snyder (who conceived the story and co-wrote the screenplay) mostly adheres to familiar sci-fi tenets, sending our heroes from planet to planet to collect crusty outcasts to take on Noble. Production designers Stephen Swain and Stefan Dechant fail to come up with much that’s imaginative in these different realms, and the effects work is often underwhelming – especially for anyone who watches Rebel Moon on the big screen, where the unconvincing digital backgrounds are especially noticeable. With its nods to The Dirty Dozen and Seven Samurai, the film needs to lure us in with colourful characters coming together for a common cause, but there is little spark between the protagonists.  Rebel Moon ends with a cliffhanger, promising a Part Two that might be more action-packed as the stakes rise and the final showdown looms on the horizon. It does seem doubtful, though, that Snyder’s threadbare ideas and predictable visual onslaught will reap greater rewards in the next chapter. The richness and awe of Star Wars feels like a long time ago, indeed. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Dec 15, 2023"," On the red carpet at the Rebel Moon premiere, producer Deborah Snyder said that writer-director Zack Snyder first told her about his idea for a Seven Samurai in space when they were dating. As the pair first met in 1996, and there has been plenty of time to think this through, I feel justified in putting on my most disappointed middle school teacher voice to say, ""There’s just no excuse for this."" Snyder’s lumbering film, the full title of which is Rebel Moon — Part One: A Child of Fire, is severely lacking in urgency compared to Akira Kurosawa's source material or John Sturges’ Western remake, The Magnificent Seven. As a space opera, it has none of the weight of Dune, none of the characterizations of Guardians of the Galaxy, none of the madness of Jupiter Ascending or The Fifth Element and none of the pep of Star Wars.  On that last point, it is well known that Snyder pitched it to fit in Lucasfilm’s canon, but that didn’t pan out. The reskin is laughable: the lawful good desert farmers, the dangerous cantina packed with zany aliens, the glowing red laser swords, a final boss fight on a hovering platform in a cloud city. Did Snyder and Netflix run this by legal? Even individual shots, like a close-up on clanging boots amid billows of steam as they exit a newly docked shuttle in a space hangar — as we hear someone's labored breathing — is striking in its derivativeness. This would matter a lot less, of course, if what was happening on screen were more interesting. The story is pretty simple. Kora (Sofia Boutella) is an outsider living among a collective of kindly, jig-dancing grain farmers on The Veldt led by Corey Stoll in an outrageous beard. Nazi-looking baddies representing the Motherworld, led by Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein), have been searching the galaxy for a brother-and-sister pair of rebels (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman as Darrian and Debra Bloodaxe) and their small army of insurgents. The pursuit is taking longer than expected, so they need supplies. What that means is they intend to plunder The Veldt of all their grain, leaving the kind villagers to starve! After making a violent introduction, Noble says they will be back in ten weeks — forgetting to make any adjustment for time dilation as they zip between planets. Kora, clearly laden with a backstory, is ready to scram, but after killing a bunch of Motherworld sentries left behind when they try to rape a young girl, she realizes she needs to assemble a crew and lead a fight. With nice guy Gunnar (Michiel Huisman, who kinda resembles Zack Snyder in a way), she heads into the town of Providence, looking for mercenaries. At a wacky cantina (creativity points to the sentient slug that communicates through schlepped-around corpses), she meets Kai, a sandy-haired rogue who also has a ship. (Where have I seen this before?) Kai happens to know where all the best anti-Motherworld fighters are hanging out, so they zoom around to convince them to join the show. Luckily for us, they land just when each person is about to do something cool. Tarak (Staz Nair), who looks like Daniel Day-Lewis in Last of the Mohicans with six times the muscle, is an indentured servant about to break an enormous Ray Harryhausen-esque black gryphon. Great scene. Nemesis (Bae Doona), with her not-lightsabers, is about to rescue a small child from a spider-woman (Jena Malone under a lot of makeup.) Titus (Djimon Hounsou) is drunk on what looks like a leftover set from Gladiator but sobers up after a bath as Snyder, who also worked as cinematographer here, frames him from below to best gaze at his titanic biceps. There are others in the mix (Anthony Hopkins voices a C-3P0-ish robot named Jimmy!), but, truly, most of Rebel Moon — Part One's running time is devoted to crewing up. At the end, there is a ""first fight"" with Noble's forces, and this is pretty slick looking, deploying Snyder's trademark fast-then-slow-then-fast-again shots and imagery that could double as a sidescroller video game. Most of the tactile elements of the movie — the cloaks, the helmets, the guns, the creatures (there's a squid-faced king!), the Harkonnen-ready tentacle hookahs, the ships — all look really cool. If I were grading what film snobs call the mise-en-scène alone, it would be an A. But, weirdly, the action sequences are merely good. Considering that Snyder's earlier work, especially 300, is one of the most visually revolutionary movies ever made (I really believe that), it's surprising that this comes across as nothing too special. What's worse is that I saw this at Netflix's jewel box New York City theater, The Paris, equipped with state-of-the-art sound and projected on 70 mm. Most people will watch this on their iPads.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023","  Few directors seem as controversial or beloved as Zack Snyder. The director who famously kicked off the DCEU in 2013 and whose cut of Justice League sparked a fierce fan campaign has his admirers and his haters, and he is frequently the subject of online discourse. To be perfectly frank, I’ve never felt that Snyder’s work was my cup of tea, but I was also fully aware that all I had seen from him was his DC movies. Looking ahead to Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire, I was genuinely curious to see whether an original sci-fi would endear me more to him. Having watched all two hours and 14 minutes of it, I can say that while there are many elements I enjoyed, there are more that left me frustrated. With Rebel Moon, Snyder is positively bursting with exciting ideas, but they lack compelling characters and a solid plot to hold them up.  From director Zack Snyder comes Rebel Moon, a sci-fi action movie set in the depths of space and following a colony that is facing the threat of Regent Balisarius. Sofia Boutella plays a warrior charged with recruiting others in the fight against the tyrant, and his unstoppable forces that are dead set on conquest.   As voiceover narration from Anthony Hopkins’ robot character Jimmy helpfully informs us, Rebel Moon is set in an expansive galaxy controlled by the Motherworld and its Imperium, a tyrannical, power-hungry force. On the quiet moon Veldt, a battle-hardened woman named Kora (Sofia Boutella) has her chance at peace in a farming village thwarted by the arrival of Imperium forces led by the sadistic Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), who seeks to take the village’s crops for his army. After a tragic incident brings the village under Imperium rule, Kora realizes that fighting might be the only option to keep her home safe, despite her reluctance to get involved. And so, she sets off with her friend, fellow farmer Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) to put together a group of warriors who can stand against Noble and his forces.   I’ll be tempted to see what happens, but I can’t say I was left with a desperate need to have the next movie 
right this second
 when the movie ended.   Even those who don’t follow Snyder’s work will quickly see he has big, big plans for the Rebel Moon universe. The title Part One: A Child of Fire signals there is more to come in this story and, frustratingly, it falls into the typical pitfalls that come from a movie that is advertised to only be one half of the tale. Snyder wrote the screenplay alongside Kurt Johnstad and Shay Hattan, building upon his original idea for what was once a Star Wars movie. Much of A Child of Fire is spent traveling from planet to planet recruiting characters, and each new world feels distinctive and vibrant, thanks to the work of production designers Stephen Swain and Stefan Dechant. This is where Snyder’s creativity truly shines, and it is genuinely impressive to see. Each planet could sustain myriad stories (and Netflix likely hopes that they will), and that’s before one even touches the twisty lore of the Motherworld. Rebel Moon is a universe rich with opportunity.   The problem, though, is that the same cannot be said for the film's characters; at least, not in the way they are presented here. Snyder has assembled an impressive cast, including Charlie Hunnam (as roguish pilot Kai), Djimon Hounsou (as the disgraced yet legendary General Titus), and Ray Fisher (as resistance leader Darrian Bloodaxe). It is abundantly clear that Snyder has conceived deep backstories for each character, and yet the only one who gets more than a sentence of development is Kora, whose backstory unfurls over not one, but two expository monologues and flashback sequences. Kora makes for a compelling protagonist, and Boutella is excellent in the role, but so much of her journey feels emotionless. We're left to fill in the gaps for ourselves as to why each character is willing to join Kora and Gunnar on their mission, and the whole team barely gets any time to interact with each other. Arguably, the character who gets the most development beyond Kora is Jimmy, and he disappears from the plot after the first act. Before he goes, though, he’s a delight.   This is already a problem for Rebel Moon even before it runs into the typical part one problem — it's a story that has barely begun before the credits start to roll. Much of A Child of Fire's plot revolves around Kora and Gunnar assembling the team, and thus plays more like many ideas strung together than one of cohesion. It is a relief to know that Rebel Moon – Part Two: The Scargiver is only a few months away, but it’s still frustrating to realize that, overall, the story didn’t move as far forward as it should have. In this, Snyder prioritizes worldbuilding over character and plot development, and that hinders Rebel Moon’s potential. Without strong characters to root for, what will make us tune in for the sequel? Personally, I’ll be tempted to see what happens, but I can’t say I was left with a desperate need to have the next movie right this second when the movie ended.   The Snyder faithful will no doubt eagerly devour Rebel Moon, as it holds plenty of his work's hallmarks: Incredibly fit characters carrying out breathless action sequences, striking visuals, and a lot of slow-motion (a trick that I find exhausting, but I digress). Like Snyder’s previous movies, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire will have an extended director’s cut on Netflix, and that could very well fix some of the issues with its characters and plot. However, if one has to watch an extended cut just to get half the story, then maybe the original version isn’t as successful as it could be.

"Dec 15, 2023"," Filmmaker Zack Snyder has spent much of his past decade in superhero world, as well as a return to the zombies, the subject of his early-career remake of Dawn of the Dead. The fact that he hasn’t been roped into directing a Star Wars movie is surprising, but less so, when you realize that the filmmaker, often referred to as a “visionary,” would probably want to very much do his own thing. That brings us to Rebel Moon Part 1 – , which could be seen as Snyder’s take on the epic sci-fi space opera. It sounds good on paper, but does the filmmaker behind 300 and Watchmen deliver? Read on. On the planet of Veldt, we’re introduced to the small farming village where Sofia Boutella’s Kora has been helping the peaceful community with their harvest, along with Michiel Huisman’s Gunnar. When the ruthless Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) turns up with his troops, the people of Veldt know they’re in trouble, but they’re also not in a place to fight for their lives. When some of Noble’s men threaten to assault one of the village’s teenage women, Kora steps up, kills all of them, and then goes on the run with Gunnar to find others who can help them fight the Realm. This leads into a plot straight out of Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, similar to how George Lucas borrowed from Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress for the original Star Wars in 1977.  We then meet a number of other bounty hunters and assassins – Charlie Hunnam’s Kai, essentially the film’s Han Solo; Bae Doona’s Nemesis, who even has her own set of light sabers; Djimon Hounsou as General Titus, pretty much the same character he’s been playing forever; Ray Fisher as “Darrian Bloodaxe”; and Staz Nair’s Tarak, who at least has a sequence where he breaks a wild flying creature. There’s no question that Boutella’s Kora is pretty kick-ass during her fight sequences, but she’s not the strongest of actors to ground a movie like this, so the movie resorts to a number of flashbacks to tell Kora’s backstory and her connections to the overlord, Regent Balisarius (Fra Fee), who is mostly being saved for Part 2. Despite so many characters being thrown at you, none of them are particularly interesting, especially the case with Gunnar. He’s set up as a potential love interest for Kora, but Huisman has the personality and charisma of a kitchen sponge… and a dry one at that. Part of what Snyder does try to introduce in his sci-fi epic is all sorts of “cool” creatures and gizmos that no one has seen before, but even the most innovative of ideas has DNA in other things we’ve seen before, whether it’s The Matrix or The Lord of the Rings or Avatar, or any of much better sci-fi/fantasy epics.  There are even stranger elements that may have been inspired by David Lynch‘s Dune, rather than the more recent multiple Oscar winner. Rebel Moon just makes it more obvious why James Cameron is a master at what he does. Granted, a movie like this is meant to be seen on a big screen, probably why Snyder and his team made it, so it’s a shame that like with most Netflix movies, it will only get a nominal theatrical release. Take away any big-screen spectacle, and Rebel Moon is just a lot of bad writing, bad acting and bad accents, which do not make for a good combination. Regardless, it doesn’t matter how many big explosions or CG are thrown your way, nothing can get you to care about so many poorly-realized characters. I’ve often complained about the fact that film critics seem to tune out and have no interest in giving movies a fair shake once mid-December comes. In the case of Rebel Moon, any critical ennui is well-deserved and earned, because we’ve come to expect better from Snyder and his creative collaborators. Snyder, who acts as his own cinematographer, works with a lot of those he worked with on Zack Snyder’s Justice League, including Composer Tom Holkenborg and VFX Supe “DJ” Des Jardin, but they’re all clearly working to support the vision of their director, which just doesn’t seem to be as on point as some of his earlier movies. The story plods along with a few action sequences, lots of explosions, a face-off against Noble, and then it just crashes to an end with the group back on Veldt. Make no mistake that this is only half a movie and not one that sets anything up in a way that anyone will absolutely need to see what happens next right away. In some ways, one of the more interesting (though still derivative) characters is the philosophical sentient robot, voiced by Sir Anthony Hopkins, who sadly, does not go on the main journey, but returns later wearing elk horns, for reasons we’ll have to try to care enough to watch that second part. The killer is that Rebel Moon Part 1 is being released just a few short months after Gareth Edwards’ excellent The Creator, and James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3, which despite being the third chapter in a far-spanning studio franchise, shows a filmmaker that understands the concept of space opera and having characters that the viewers can root for, which Snyder clearly does not. To wrap things up, if you’re going to try your hand at world-building, maybe do so without cherry-picking from so many other existing movie worlds, because anyone older than 13 will immediately know all the references and realize there are much better movies they could be watching. Rebel Moon Part 1 might be one of Snyder’s worst efforts to date. It’s just dull and derivative, with very little to warrant there even being a Part 2, and therefore, just an atrocious waste of time and money. Talent: D

"Dec 15, 2023"," 
As divisive as his films tend to be, many can agree that Zack Snyder's career has always been that of a trendsetter. When the filmmaker's distinct grasp of visual style and flair (developed while working in the music video scene early on) brought Hollywood knocking at his door, Snyder spent the next several years bringing various concepts to life that most considered ""unfilmable."" His groundbreaking adaptation of the graphic novel ""300,"" which arguably redefined blockbuster action in pop culture throughout the early aughts, directly led to Snyder getting his hands on the holy grail of ""Watchmen"" in 2009. Although superhero movies moving forward would generally opt for the airy tone of Marvel's ""Iron Man"" rather than Snyder's grand and operatic take, the seeds were planted for the DC superhero world that would consume him for much of the next decade — and eventually lead to darker, more cynical, and self-reflexively critical comic book adaptations like ""The Boys,"" ""Invincible,"" and more down the line.

Which brings us to ""Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire,"" a mouthful of a title that best encapsulates the ambitions — and flaws — at the heart of this new fantasy/sci-fi movie. Obviously meant to kickstart an entire franchise, the script written by Snyder, Shay Hatten, and Kurt Johnstad frontloads as much worldbuilding, dangling subplots, and reams of lore as it possibly can. And in the span of 2 hours and 14 minutes, it packs in everything from the adventurous spirit of ""Star Wars"" to the stunning vistas and creature designs of James Cameron's ""Avatar"" to the dense mythology of ""Dune."" But as the slow and drawn-out first act gives way to a tepid ""Getting the gang together"" middle portion and an explosive yet perfunctory climax, the space opera's main source of inspiration becomes abundantly clear.

More than the beat-for-beat parallels with ""Seven Samurai"" and ""The Magnificent Seven"" (or, for those of a certain age, ""A Bug's Life""), ""Rebel Moon"" takes its cues from a much more surprising touchstone: video games.
As much as this might seem to align with the director's sensibilities and pioneering spirit, especially as a growing wave of video game adaptations are setting themselves up as the industry's next big thing, ""Rebel Moon"" and its reels of epic imagery all but collapses under the weight of such an uncinematic narrative approach. Between this and 2021's ""Army of the Dead,"" it's undeniable that Snyder has emerged from his troubled DC experiences with a healthier perspective of the current studio system, a refreshing pivot towards making original movies instead, and (dare I say it) an infinitely better match between moviemaker and material. Through it all, however, the unfortunate fact remains that his storytelling instincts leave much to be desired.

Through it all, however, the unfortunate fact remains that his storytelling instincts leave much to be desired. For all its blockbuster gaudiness, ""Rebel Moon"" still displays a shocking amount of restraint in the early going. The film opens on a ponderous exposition dump by a narrating Anthony Hopkins, who voices an ancient robot named Jimmy (performed by Dustin Ceithamer on-set), but settles into a nice rhythm once we meet our main, if reluctant, hero. An outsider who settled on the desolate moon of Veldt two years prior to the events of the film, Kora (a steely and compelling Sofia Boutella) is content living in anonymity among a village of hedonistic, Viking-like settlers. All the typical hero's journey tropes are present and accounted for here, from the man harboring an innocent crush on her (Michiel Huisman's Gunnar, channeling an ""Aw shucks"" appeal to mostly convincing effect) to her mysterious backstory soon doled out in extensive flashbacks to the impending threat of the Imperium (known colloquially as the authoritarian ""Motherworld"") arriving on her doorstep. As action-oriented as he may be, Snyder takes his time and allows these early moments to breathe. Perhaps a little too much, as it turns out. The fly in the ointment comes from how talky and dialogue-heavy this table setting proves to be, which has never been a strength of most of his movies. Although this society's emphasis on a simple life and worldly pleasures helps ground this space opera in something tangible, no characters ever talk in anything resembling actual conversations. By the time Kora begins reciting her motivations and backstory out loud for the dozenth time (""I'm only telling you this so you know who I am,"" Kora literally says to Gunnar at one point after a prolonged flashback spelling out her origins), it's easy to imagine clunky, video-gamey dialogue wheels popping up on-screen to help dole out the bare minimum of pertinent information to us gamers viewers. The issue only worsens when the plot kicks off in earnest, incited by Ed Skrein's vicious Admiral Noble and his Imperium warship appearing over Veldt alongside a small army of invaders and demanding a cut of the inhabitants' precious stores of grain. Kora's speed-ramped fight with some unruly soldiers (disappointingly, Snyder resorts to the threat of sexual assault as a motivation here) dashes any hopes of a peaceful resolution, leading her on a planet-hopping quest to put together a team of criminals, insurgents, and revolutionaries to help her small town repel their oppressors. The problem is, hardly any of these oddballs are given a good reason to join up in the first place. Kora and Gunnar repeatedly arrive in some gorgeously imagined new locale (including a blatant ""Star Wars"" cantina riff), encounter a new character just in time for them to undertake a random side-mission to prove their worth, and simply move on to the next recruit. This bizarrely episodic structure might as well be ripped straight out of countless video games, with NPCs milling around with no actual interiority ... right up until the moment the main character interacts with them and triggers the next level. It's a shame, too, because the ensemble team consisting of Charlie Hunnam's roguish bounty hunter Kai, Bae Doona's honorable warrior Nemesis, Staz Nair's perpetually shirtless former slave Tarak, Djimon Hounsou's disgraced military general Titus, and Ray Fisher as rebel leader Bloodaxe, none of whom ever really develop or bond with one another in any meaningful way, deserved much better than this. And then there's the Netflix of it all. As much as streaming allows movies of this magnitude and inherent risk to exist in the first place these days, it's truly a disservice that most viewers will never be able to experience a story of such sweeping scale and unrestrained creativity — for all his narrative blind spots, Zack Snyder still has a masterful eye for composing and framing larger-than-life shots — on the big screen. The full effect of the thunderous sound design, Snyder's own cinematography, and Tom Holkenborg's (known as Junkie XL) propulsive, moody, and stirring score is impossible to recreate from one's laptop or living room TV. Of course, it's then fair to wonder whether the video-gamey nature of the story was done in part to satisfy the cravings of the streaming service's all-powerful algorithm; similar to how Snyder outright admitted he was told that movies over two hours long don't perform well, perhaps there's something about a series of fetch quests resembling video game cutscenes that's proven to hold the average Netflix subscriber's attention while they're playing on their phone. Cynical? Probably, but little else would seem to explain the disconnect between the film's starry ambitions and its brutally complacent treatment of most of its own characters. Granted, we know that an extended director's cut is in the offing (one that should fix both the lack of character development and the distractingly bloodless violence of the theatrical version) ... but how often do gamers celebrate the rollout of patches and DLCs needed to fix the core problems of a new release? Ultimately, ""Rebel Moon"" resembles little more than a grab-bag collection of world-building influences, mythology, and epic storytelling that we've seen done better many times before. As much as dye-in-the-wool fans will find plenty to geek out over, not even Snyder's usual tendency for bold storytelling choices or idiosyncratic themes will be able to move the needle much for casual viewers or controversy-seeking bystanders. It can sometimes be tricky when genre filmmakers finally get their chance to make a long-gestating passion project, running the gamut of James Cameron bringing the world of Pandora to life in his ""Avatar"" saga to Brad Bird's infamously misguided ""Tomorrowland."" ""Rebel Moon"" lands somewhere in the middle — neither catastrophic enough to go down in legend as a misfiring curio like ""Jupiter Ascending"" or ""Valerian,"" begging to be reclaimed years from now, nor memorable or emotionally effective enough to merit as much pomp and circumstance as this soon-to-be franchise inevitably will.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 15, 2023"," Zack Snyder rarely does things by halves, so with one Netflix universe already under way with Army of the Dead, he's launching a second universe with Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire. The space opera has been an idea in Snyder's mind since his college days and almost came to life as his take on a Star Wars movie. That pitch didn't land at Lucasfilm so Snyder paired up again with Netflix to make Rebel Moon into its own unique universe, one that will start with a two-part story before potentially expanding further. Rebel Moon's opening salvo has now arrived on Netflix, but has it been worth the wait? The answer to that will lie in your tolerance for a Zack Snyder movie.  After an opening exposition dump (the first of many) about the Motherworld, we first meet Kora (Sofia Boutella) on Veldt where she has become a member of the farming community there after crash landing on Veldt previously. Her hopes of living a life of peace are shattered when Admiral Noble (Ed Skrein), loyal servant of the tyrannical Regent Balisarious (Fra Fee), arrives on Veldt. He wants produce to feed his army as they hunt for a group of rebels, led by Darian and Devra Bloodaxe (Ray Fisher and Cleopatra Coleman). Unsurprisingly, Noble's request is more of a demand than a request and when Motherworld soldiers take up residence on Veldt, Kora is unwilling to stand by and let another group of people suffer. Kora can't fight the Motherworld alone though, so with the help of Gunnar (Michiel Huisman), she starts a journey to different worlds to find a band of warriors who are willing to risk their lives to defend Kora's people. Given it's an idea that's been percolating in Snyder's head for decades, it's no surprise that Rebel Moon takes place in a richly detailed world. From the worlds themselves to the costumes of the characters, there's backstory to be found everywhere – even if it might not always be obvious. The problem is that the plot that Snyder has come up for the movie is nowhere near as interesting as the world it takes place in. It's a very straightforward Seven Samurai tale of getting a ragtag group together to fight a bigger evil, and there's almost too much to fit in for a runtime of just over two hours. It leaves Rebel Moon feeling episodic, as after spending a lengthy time on Veldt in the first act, the movie jumps from planet to planet to pick up the various warriors without really showing us who any of them really are. Kora gets the most development as the lead, but the movie is so much on the move that her backstory is dished out in two lengthy exposition dumps. We're sure it's a problem that will be lessened in an already-planned director's cut, said to be an hour longer. You'll be left wishing that Snyder focused on one version of the movie though as Rebel Moon – Part One is overstuffed and rushed in its current form. Each planet allows Snyder to do his own take on various genres. For instance, the port city of Providence on Veldt where they meet Kai (Charlie Hunnam) is a seedier version of the Mos Eisley Cantina, while Neu-Wodi sees Tarak (Staz Nair) tame a griffin-like creature called a Bennu before joining the team in an Avatar-esque moment. The impressive world-building means that the planets do feel distinct from one another, and the focus on practical effects where possible do lend them a lived-in feel. However, the set pieces are generally superfluous and then before you know it, you're at the climax of Rebel Moon without really seeing it coming. That's mostly because this is one story chopped into two, with each of those parts stripped down for the PG-13 releases. The big battle is still to come and Part One would have had a stronger conclusion had Snyder not tacked on a needless coda, revolving around the fate of one important character. For all of the scale and world-building, Rebel Moon is dramatically unsatisfying and often dull. It means you can't help focusing on familiar Snyder flaws such as the need to show and tell backstories, as well as another lead female character being motivated by sexual assault. As with Army of the Dead, the bones are there for Rebel Moon – Part One to have been a stronger movie than it's turned out to be. It's visually impressive and the action sequences are well-staged, even if the slow-motion is overused (as to be expected from a Snyder movie by now), while you will be intrigued where it goes next. The frustration here is that with Netflix seemingly allowing Snyder to do what he wanted, he didn't just go with his planned cut as the only version of the movie, a choice which could have solved its biggest issues. As it is, Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child of Fire bears all the familiar traits of a Zack Snyder movie – from the good to the bad – and if you're not already a convert, you will be wondering what all the fuss is about. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Dec 15, 2023"," More infuriating than the absurd punctuation of its title is how blatantly Zack Snyder’s “Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire” skirts homage and rips off “Star Wars.” Putting “Part One” in a movie’s title simply forewarns audiences that they’re about to watch an incomplete affair—a misguided decision that plagued Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows—Part 1, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn—Part 1, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay—Part 1, and Mission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One. Zack Snyder falls into the same trap with the excessively punctuated Rebel Moon—Part One: A Child of Fire, the maiden chapter of a two-film science fiction saga (in theaters Dec. 15; on Netflix Dec. 21) whose lack of originality is only matched by its humorlessness. Cribbing so liberally from Star Wars that George Lucas deserves hefty royalties, this misbegotten attempt at creating a new out-of-this-world Snyderverse is merely a knockoff dressed up in its director’s stylistic signatures, and all the more depressing for not even properly concluding its painfully shallow tale. While Lucas’ Episode Four was famously inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s The Hidden Fortress, Snyder instead mimics Lucas as well as the Japanese master’s Seven Samurai (and its progeny, The Magnificent Seven and A Bug’s Life). This appears to be some sort of deliberate double homage, but it speaks to the threadbare derivativeness of this endeavor, whose plot and designs come across as faded photocopies of photocopies.  In an unspecified distant galaxy, a fascistic Motherworld has responded to the treacherous assassination of its slain king, queen, and princess by sending out evil boot-stompers like Admiral Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein)—who dresses like an SS cosplayer—to root out pesky rebels. Atticus tracks one such outfit to a tranquil farming planet where he also finds Kora (Sofia Boutella), a loner living in peaceful harmony with the land she tills, her hands caressing and sniffing the soil with the same sub-Malickian gentleness that Snyder first employed in Man of Steel. Kora is beautiful, tough and mysterious, and ensuing flashbacks reveal her connection to the Motherworld and its tyrannical military. Those sequences are leadenly expository but at least they show and tell, which is more than can be said about the rest of Rebel Moon. When not indulging in empty flowery language, Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Shay Hatten’s script has everyone bluntly explain who they are, what they feel, and why they’re doing what they’re doing. After one particular storytime interlude about her traumatic past as an orphan of war and cog in the Motherworld machine, Kora remarks, “I’m only telling you this so you know who I am.” The problem, however, is that no matter how much these characters describe and define themselves, they remain so utterly featureless that calling them one-dimensional would be a compliment. Kora is on the lam because she’s wanted for a crime she undoubtedly didn’t commit (stay tuned for that revelation in Part Two!). Hiding out in a quasi-Viking agricultural village led by Corey Stoll’s beaded-bearded leader, Kora is forced into action when Atticus arrives and promptly (and violently) demands the community’s entire grain supply in ten weeks’ time. Taking harvest manager Gunar (Michiel Huisman) with her, she ventures to distant planets to round up a motley crew of fighters who will stand against Atticus and his stormtroopers.  This entails wearing a Jedi cloak, visiting an alien cantina, and hooking up with assorted rogues who are easy to find, even easier to recruit (despite this being an apparent lose-lose proposition), and devoid of notable character traits beyond their basic descriptions as a drunken former general (Djimon Hounsou), a thief with a rickety starship (Charlie Hunnam), a shirtless-and-oiled hunk with a gift for taming animals (Staz Nair) and a cyborg swordswoman (Doona Bae). These characters have no personalities and do little besides blindly follow Kora, a heroine embodied by Boutella as the blandest of badasses. The film barely sketches its protagonists and, worse, refuses to give them funny one-liners or amusing quirks, thereby turning the material laughably severe. Sprinkled throughout are hints of Dune and Blade Runner, yet Star Wars is Snyder’s Rosetta Stone, such that every moment features a character (is that an amphibian Gungan relative of Jar Jar Binks?) or element (are those flaming lightsaber-ish swords?) cribbed from Lucas’ original and prequel trilogies. So heavy is that series’ influence that it’s no surprise Rebel Moon began life, a decade ago, as a pitch for a new Star Wars franchise installment. Still, that doesn’t excuse its inability to fashion a single sight or idea that isn’t a dull sci-fi cliché. Snyder vainly strives to interject some weirdo carnality into Rebel Moon, be it the notion that sex and romance are key to both a well-oiled war machine and a bountiful farm, or Atticus’ fondness for tentacle erotica. Like everything else in these lifeless proceedings, however, this is all just detritus drowning in a sea of endless slow-motion. The director uses his most beloved embellishment not just for his numerous combat set pieces but for any inconsequential shot that hasn’t already been decorated with blinding lens flares. The film’s repetitiveness extends from its aesthetic devices to its battle choreography, with Kora routinely power-sliding on the ground as she slices and shoots up her enemies, and others power-leaping through the air in panoramas that fail to conjure grand Heavy Metal-style magic. Anthony Hopkins’ intro narration (the film’s de facto opening crawl) and voice performance as a soulful ex-military robot is as random and tossed-off as most of Rebel Moon’s story, which ultimately leads to precisely the sort of Empire Strikes Back-ish showdown one starts to expect around the midway point. As with his prior Army of the Dead, Snyder’s latest is visually polished, technically accomplished, and crushingly generic, failing to deliver anything approaching novelty—to the point that one alien scoundrel looks like a Lord of the Rings Orc and another monster (played by Jena Malone) resembles the offspring of Star Trek’s Borg and a giant spider.  The dearth of imagination is shocking, and the fact that many significant details aren’t even explicated until its finale is par for its ungainly course. “Part Two” may be on its way in April 2024, but given this first installment’s shoddy plagiarism, it’s hard to imagine it doing more than continuing to clumsily cover Lucas’ greatest hits.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 15, 2023"," Zack Snyder’s version of Star Wars is as messy as it is epic. Here’s our full review of Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child Of Fire. Snyder, a lifelong Star Wars fan, always imagined himself directing a major space opera, filled with curious creatures, epic action and fearless heroes. Rebel Moon doesn’t have the child-like curiosity and wonder that George Lucas’ career-defining franchise has, but it is a particularly handsome piece of action cinema. Rebel Moon is Snyder’s first post-DC film. The director wrapped up his ‘Snyderverse’ with the four-hour cut of Justice League and claims to be done with that particular band of superheroes, who are now in the hands of James Gunn and Peter Safran. Yet the plot of Rebel Moon is eerily similar to the current, dominant superhero sagas, and it also fits neatly into Snyder’s own filmography.  The film begins with a melancholic, but weirdly soothing voiceover from Anthony Hopkins, who voices Jimmy, a sympathetic robot. We begin our story on the moon of Veldt, a peaceful farming community. It’s also the new home of Kora (Sofia Boutella), a former soldier who is trying to put as much distance between her and her violent past as possible.  So far, so Star Wars. Admiral Noble (played by a deliciously evil Ed Skrein) threatens the people of Veldt, who have sold their crops to the Bloodaxes (Cleopatra Coleman and Ray Fisher), freedom fighters who oppose the Motherworld. In order to secure her new life, Kora teams up with Gunnar (Michiel Huisman) and sets out to find a group of heroes to defend Veldt with her.  A Child Of Fire is mostly concerned with getting this ragtag group of heroes together and building the world surrounding them. Admittedly, it’s a beautiful and inherently violent world, a speciality of Snyder’s. Although there’s some dodgy green screen work in A Child Of Fire, Snyder manages to craft magnificent visuals and his camerawork is pleasingly dynamic. Action sequences are filmed with clarity and rhythm, but A Child Of Fire comes to a screeching halt whenever someone isn’t trying to shoot a space-Nazi in the face.  As with most of Snyder’s films, the script slightly lets A Child Of Fire down. A lot of seeds are planted for future instalments, including next year’s Part Two: The Scargiver, but it’s at the expense of character work.  Kora is a classic Snyder protagonist; impossibly powerful and righteous, but lost. Sofia Boutella does a fine job at portraying Kora’s physicality as well as her internal struggles as she is forced to rely on the skills she learned in another life. Arguably, there was more intricate character work to be done here, but the action-packed plot has no time for it.  Staz Nair gets a fun introduction in a scene that feels, strangely, lifted from Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban. Djimon Hounsou portrays a strong and silent former General and Charlie Hunnam is all slippery charm as Kai, Kora’s second in command. Doona Bae is also particularly impressive as Nemesis, a half-cyborg with heated swords.  At times, Rebel Moon feels like an amalgamation of every other major franchise out there. True, the Star Wars vibes are immaculate, but the creature design borrows heavily from Lord Of The Rings and we’ve already mentioned Harry Potter. It’s all done lovingly, but with so many visual references to other franchises, Snyder fails to make Rebel Moon into its own thing, with a strong identity and visual language. The cut dropping on Netflix 22 December is a hair over two hours and it flows remarkably well. Snyder has always been good at pacing his films; Justice League may be unnecessarily bloated but it never dragged and neither does A Child Of Fire. A longer, more brutal cut is also on the way, but it’s hard to imagine it fixing any of A Child Of Fire’s flaws.  Still, A Child Of Fire is helplessly dragged down by the plot only serving to set up The Scargiver, but there is plenty to enjoy here too, depending on your opinion on Snyder, of course.  All the usual Snyderisms are here, there’s plenty of slow-mo and brutal action and it’s hard to deny Snyder’s capabilities as a visual storyteller. Rebel Moon – Part One: A Child Of Fire is a bit wobbly on its own two feet, but it promises great things for The Scargiver next year.
