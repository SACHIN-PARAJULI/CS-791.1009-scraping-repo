"Apr 4, 2024",A beautiful capper to not only just this new trilogy but the entire Skywalker saga...,POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2023","I had a lot of fun with this film, but this finale that supposedly concludes a nine-film franchise has to be the worst out of the entire Skywalker saga.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2023"," In a galaxy far, far away, life is not always easy, and I’m not just talking about epic battles between good and evil. Though the final chapter of George Lucas’s saga begins right where its prequel left off, with the Resistance and The First Order very much at war and Rey (Daisy Ridley) still trying to understand the ways of the Force, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker also introduces new elements that drive the narrative away from the direction established by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi.  Part of what made fans have such strong opinions (whether positive or negative) on Episode VIII is that it genuinely managed to subvert expectations on what a Star Wars movie should be like. In The Last Jedi, we learned that Jedis can make mistakes, that being rebellious isn’t always the answer, and that not every Star Wars character needs to be related to a Skywalker in order to be gifted in the Force. As a matter of fact, Rey’s parents were “nobodies”, and yet the Force is still very much “strong in this one”, as Master Yoda would put it.  Johnson also enabled ordinary characters, such as Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Vice Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern), to play an extraordinary role in the rebellion, and used Rey’s unexplicable connection with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to bring further meaning to the existence of the Force. Though The Last Jedi left more than one question unanswered and plenty of room for developing certain themes that are only hinted at in the film, The Rise of Skywalker strays from Johnson’s direction and takes a different path entirely. If The Last Jedi left us wondering about a child using the Force to move a broom, The Rise of Skywalker wants us to stick to the main storyline and directs our attention back to Rey’s origins. In fact, let’s forget about the last few movies entirely: Emperor Snoke (Andy Serkis) was as much of a “nobody” as Rey is, and we now have a new villain. Or, rather, a very old one: J.J.Abrams resurrects Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is back with a new, evil plan. Only, his plan is not new and not evil at all, and his Night of the Living Dead look is not threatening at all. In fact, Palpatine’s unconvincing scheming is only the first of a series of developments that are not only messy and confusing, but also full of plot holes.  With the kind of attachment fans have to the first three chapters of the Star Wars saga, a high degree of nostalgia is to be expected in its latest releases, and The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t disappoint. Seeing Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) on the Millennium Falcon will always remind us of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and we’ll never get tired of listening to C-3PO (Anthony Daniels)’s unsolicited opinions and watching Leia (Carrie Fisher) gracefully lead the rebels. The Rise of Skywalker provides plenty of nostalgic moments, quotable lines and familiar appearances that remind us of specific moments in Star Wars history.  It also leaves enough room for John Boyega and Oscar Isaac to shine as Finn and Poe Dameron, who are, without a doubt, the real heroes of this film. There are hilarious lines, meme-worthy scenes, insightful pearls of wisdom, chess games and a few truly unexpected twists that give much needed screen time to characters we seldom get to see. Yet, the narrative is so messy that it leaves little room for any real growth. It’s hard to take The Rise of Skywalker seriously, and that is simply because some of its narrative developments don’t seem to make much sense. In a film that is developed around nostalgia and that seems to borrow props from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, dialogues and scenes (and Basilisk!) from Harry Potter, supporting characters from Pirates of the Caribbean and sentimental moments from The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast, there isn’t much room for originality. A lot happens in a short amount of time: plans are conceived, characters learn unconvenient truths about each other and their relatives (in the best Star Wars tradition) and choices are made.  Yet, the absence of context makes it hard for the audience to understand some of these developments, which are given names but never really explained. In a film where everything happens too quickly and too easily, there isn’t any conflict to face, just like there is no real momentum or build-up. Though the movie does provide a few emotional scenes towards the end, it doesn’t leave us much room to let its harshest choices really sink in. It also makes it really hard to understand its confusing ending, and that is a real shame. Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker is not an unenjoyable movie altogether. You’ll find yourself laughing at its most absurd moments and genuinely having fun during its battle scenes. You’ll be mesmerized by Adam Driver’s performance and you’ll find yourself rooting for Finn, Poe, Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2D2 at different times and for different reasons. You’ll enjoy watching Lando (Billy Dee Williams) in action once more, you’ll get teary at the most unexpected times and you’ll channel your inner BB-8 (Brian Herring) more than once. You’ll also be frustrated by the film’s lack of clarity, and, at the end of it all, you’ll find yourself struggling to remember its most confusing moments.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 24, 2023"," Synopsis: When it's discovered that the evil Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) did not die at the hands of Darth Vader (James Earl Jones), the rebels must race against the clock to find out his whereabouts. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) lead the Resistance to put a stop to the First Order's plans to form a new Empire, while Rey (Daisy Ridley) anticipates her inevitable confrontation with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The Rise of Skywalker is a tremendous letdown. I won’t sugarcoat it. If someone told me at the beginning of the year that J.J. Abrams wouldn’t be able to offer a satisfying end to the nine-episode story, I would laugh like crazy. It disappointed me so much that I don’t even want to extend this review more than the usual. I know that a lot of people hated The Last Jedi, but for better or worse, that film exists. Rian Johnson’s decisions were made. Some people received them well, some didn’t. But all of us got to watch and experience his narrative. There’s something called artistic integrity, which J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio completely forgot about. The lack of respect for the saga’s previous installment is baffling. The structure-less screenplay is so unbelievably convoluted that it reaches a point where evident logical issues come into play. Major plot points occur due to some genuinely hard-to-believe events, and even the characters seem to have no path whatsoever. It’s entertainment for the sake of entertainment. Of course, there are a lot of visually jaw-dropping action sequences. The cinematography (Dan Mindel) is some of the best I’ve seen in the franchise and in this year. John Williams’ score is emotionally compelling, and it definitely elevates a lot of important moments, being a big source for the chills down my body. And yes, there are a bunch of epic scenes. However, throughout the whole runtime, the frustration was always there. Major threads and character backstories were answered in The Last Jedi, but The Rise of Skywalker feels more like another sequel to The Force Awakens than to Rian Johnson’s flick. If there’s one undeniable aspect about this trilogy that this last movie proves is that there was no plan. No roadmap. No overall structure. Whether you love or hate each or every installment, this is indisputable. Disney screwed up this time. Creative freedom is essential to filmmakers, but the production team behind a franchise needs to have a well-organized structure. The simple fact that J.J. Abrams directed the first film, left, and returned to do the third one, is already weird and uncommon by itself. Besides the lack of artistic integrity, there’s this feeling of constant disappointment throughout the movie. On several occasions, The Rise of Skywalker is so close to delivering a perfect sequence. A chill-inducing moment. An incredibly emotional scene. Almost every time, it fails at the last second, at the last line of dialogue, or at the last action movement. Some moments are still captivating, and they don’t lose that much impact. Nevertheless, some are totally destroyed by the most ridiculous, cringe-worthy choices I’ve witnessed in the saga. The first act is devoid of any thought. Characters go to places to get something they need to another place so that in that place, they find something else that leads them into another place… It’s frenetic, out-of-control pacing. The desperation to set up so many different side stories in time is so prominent that it’s visible from another galaxy. From the second act on, things get a bit more clear, and in the third act, all the threads blend decently. It’s in the last 30 minutes that the resemblances to Avengers: Endgame come into play. The only difference is that it doesn’t have 1/10 of the emotional impact due to the questionable decisions I mentioned above. Only one character got his arc complete without detours or significant changes: Kylo Ren. J.J. set him up, Rian Johnson continued his journey, and J.J. closed his arc pretty well. Every other character either got their arcs complete with major changes throughout, or they didn’t come close to finish their own story. There’s one exception, though, and that’s Carrie Fischer’s Leia. It would be extremely disrespectful and unfair for someone to criticize the filmmakers about her. They inserted her reasonably well in the scenes (please, if someone complains about visual effects, just get lost), and they did the absolute best they could under the known circumstances. I might be extremely disappointed, but I do have to send the team my congrats for closing her arc in the most dignified way possible. As for everyone else… well, the cast has been outstanding from the very beginning. Adam Driver, I have no words for him. He’s so perfect as Kylo Ren that I even defend his character as a villain more layered and emotionally complex than Darth Vader. I love Daisy Ridley as Rey, and she does a phenomenal job in this last film, even when her dialogue doesn’t entirely suit her. John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and everyone else (who I won’t mention due to possible spoilers) are all brilliant, and I have to congratulate them on making every single movie a bit better.",NEGATIVE
"Jul 20, 2023"," Star Wars has gone through three evolutionary stages. The first trilogy of films captured the spirit of the Saturday afternoon movie serials produced during the golden age of Hollywood. Imaginative world-building and unambiguous good versus evil storylines provided state of the art escapism for a generation still recovering from Watergate and Vietnam. The second trilogy reflected the creator’s elevated sense of self-importance, the films themselves taking on a pretentious air of somber seriousness, as if George Lucas thought his puerile space operas were on equal footing with Shakespeare. Aesthetically, their antiseptic, computer generated images reflected the technological boom of the ‘90s. With the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker – the supposed final episode of the final trilogy (yeah, right!) – the franchise has successfully recaptured some of the fun of the original trilogy while pandering to the concerns of millennials, such as diversity, representation and gender equality. No matter where one falls on the previous installment, the general consensus is Rian Johnson’s script for The Last Jedi was, for the most part, unpredictable, taking delight in deliberately subverting audience expectations. Despite grossing over a billion dollars, Johnson’s upset-the-apple-cart approach did not sit well with most fans. Apparently, the lesson learned from the backlash is that a successful Star Wars sequel must play it safe with a nostalgic approach that adheres to previously established formulae. To that end, writer/director J.J. Abrams, along with three other writers, course-corrected by recycling characters and plot points from the first trilogy, just as they did with The Force Awakens. Then they compensated for their lack of vision with more frequent and extravagant action sequences, Jedi powers approaching those of a god, and a bigger technological threat, which, of course, has the exploitable Achilles’ heel. Some fans might appreciate returning to familiar territory. However, there’s a fine line between familiarity and predictability, and The Rise of Skywalker crosses that line more than any of the previous chapters. It also undoes or ignores virtually everything that occurred in The Last Jedi. Structurally, it takes a while to settle into a comfortable rhythm; the first part of the film feels rushed, as if the filmmakers are desperately trying to establish where everyone is and what they’re doing as quickly as possible. The result is a “Previously on Star Wars…” ambience, as if we’re watching an extended recap of an episode that never was. Despite these shortcomings and more, The Rise of Skywalker mostly succeeds as popcorn entertainment thanks to a talented cast, impressive set pieces, a few laughs, and the occasional inspired moment. In fact, those who are emotionally invested in Rey’s character arc might want to bring some Kleenex along. But after an exhausting nine chapters, it’s become pastiche. Sadly, even John William’s classic Star Wars theme is starting to feel tired and clichéd. Ever since he was a teen, Paul has been involved in some form of film criticism, exhibition, or production. For the better part of two decades, he moderated the film discussion group, Let’s Talk About the Movies, which used to meet weekly inside the mezzanine of the historic Del Mar theater in downtown Santa Cruz. In 2023, Paul's insightful KSQD movie reviews earned him Tomatometer-Approved Critic status on Rotten Tomatoes (https://rottentomatoes.com/critic/paul-kanieski).",NEGATIVE
"Apr 16, 2023"," Wrapping up a trilogy is a hard enough task on its own, with narrative threads and character arcs needing a succinct and satisfying conclusion. But with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, director JJ Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio had to wrap up 42 years worth of storytelling in one film while trying to please various fans with multiple expectations. The end result is a complicated conclusion that hits high highs and low lows. In the film, a year has passed since the events of 2017s The Last Jedi, and the conflict between the Resistance and the First Order has been shaken up by a mysterious message sent by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), threatening the galaxy with an armada of hidden Star Destroyers. Rey (Daisy Ridley),  Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) are sent by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) on a mission to find the path towards the evil Sith menace, as Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) attempts to thwart their efforts. If that information seems like a lot to take in, then the first fifteen minutes of this movie is going to be quite a shock to the system. One of the biggest issues with the movie is the pacing, with the opening crawl feeling less like a subtle introduction laced with important information and more like a Wookieepedia entry. The audience doesn’t really have much of a chance to breathe during the first act but at the same time – there’s plenty of spectacle, awe and love for these characters that you can’t help being drawn in. During the marketing campaign, the core cast mentioned how much they enjoyed working as a trio in this film and it’s clear every time you see them on screen. The love and friendship between these characters is joyous and contagious, allowing the audience to really believe in this self-made family, which is an important theme in the movie. Speaking of stand-out performances, C3P0 (Anthony Daniels) absolutely shines in this movie (pun-intended) delivering a performance that is sure to both move the audience one moment and make them laugh the next. Newcomers Jannah (Naomi Ackie),  Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) and Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell) are a welcome introduction to the franchise but don’t have much of a chance to shine. With such a massive cast to focus on and so many narrative threads and plot details that need to be addressed.  Rian Johnson’s exploration of Kylo Ren and Rey in The Last Jedi was one of the most interesting parts of the Sequel Trilogy, and JJ Abrams picks up that torch by continuing to explore that particular relationship – including his own rendition of the fantastic force ability seen throughout the eighth installment. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver once again act their hearts out portraying these two lost yet connected souls, yearning for family. While JJ doesn’t undo Rian’s work per se, there are definitely plot points such as Rey’s background that are once again framed as a ‘mystery’, and Rose Tico’s (Kelly Marie Tran) appearance in the film is woefully short, utilizing the character in exposition scenes.  However, the film mostly benefits from the previous episodic installment. The Rise of Skywalker is visually stunning, with set-pieces such as the festival on Pasaana and the ruins of the Second Death Star being highlights of the film. It’s absolutely one of the most visually appealing entries in the franchise, providing audiences with captivating flight sequences with the Millennium Falcon and some of the best lightsaber choreography in the saga. While at first daunting, obvious reasons, the use of Carrie Fisher and Leia in the movie is beautifully done – giving the character some purpose rather than just adding her in for no reason and allowing a fitting goodbye to a character that fans have adored for 42 years. The most frustrating aspect about The Rise of Skywalker is that it tries too hard to please everybody. If anything, the lesson both fans and Lucasfilm should have learned from The Last Jedi is that sometimes you can’t please everyone – and that’s okay. Fan-service isn’t always a bad thing, in fact, there are plenty of moments in the film that are pleasantly surprising and will certainly make some long-terms fans jump up in their seats, but this film is full to the brim with it. But the issue with fans having different ideas of what they want from the film means that these crafted moments will either make you beam, groan, or both. Thankfully, The Rise of Skywalker avoids the trappings of being Return of the Jedi with a modern coat applied to it and instead delivers a satisfying ending to the saga in whole. When it comes to tying up loose ends, the film actually does a pretty good job bringing this trilogy’s story to a close and fulfilling the main arcs of each core character – and also the wider saga-long story of the Skywalkers. JJ even adds in a sequence that’s as close to putting a bow on the whole thing as we’ll ever get. However, the film is stuffed with plot and quite frankly, some things just don’t get an answer or explanation at all. Presumably, those details will be left to other writers and creators in the next few years to fill out in books, games, etc. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is a messy film that contains too much plot for its own good but also a really entertaining movie that showcases why audiences love Star Wars. Naturally, fans of Star Wars are not going to agree with every choice made in the film – but there are moments that are guaranteed to make people jump with joy.

"Mar 29, 2023"," Today is May 4th. Yep, that day. 
  Star Wars
 day. May the 4th be with you, etc. A pun that, thanks to the internet, somehow transformed a regular day into a global holiday of Star Wars worship. But there's only one problem: I don't really want to worship at that altar any more.  It's embarrassing, but there was a point in the pre-pandemic days -- during my first watch of The Rise of Skywalker -- where, in a packed theater, I audibly said ""what the hell?""  I can't remember exactly which part. There were a few candidates. It could have been right at the beginning, when Rose Tico (played by Kelly Marie Tran) was yanked from The Rise of Skywalker like Poochie from The Simpsons. A move that felt designed to placate the racist trolls who'd bullied Tran off social media in 2018.  It could have been the moment they ""unkilled"" Chewbacca, rewinding perhaps the only challenging moment in a first act that felt like it was written and edited by a 5-year-old high on sherbet.  Years later, distanced from the warped bubble of Star Wars ""discourse"" -- and its place in the culture wars that consume all light and reason -- it's still difficult to explain why this choice annoyed me so much.  In hindsight Rey's reveal was the moment when Star Wars stopped existing as an object I could believe in and transformed into banal fan fiction catering to the worst type of fan. When Star Wars shrank into a story in a Reddit thread far, far away. Designed to offend the least amount of people possible, built for people to sit in movie theatres and point. ""LOOK, IT'S LANDO. LANDO'S HERE!"" Pity my poor wife, eyes glazing over, who had to endure the train journey home. Me, arms waving like a madman, trying to explain why the passable sci-fi flick she'd just watched (and immediately began forgetting, like a normal adult) was a betrayal. That it deliberately and systematically unraveled every attempt made by The Last Jedi to reinvent Star Wars and have it successfully escape the dull nostalgia pit it's now fully descended into. I stand by the assessment. The Last Jedi was a movie that demanded we ""let the past die."" It railed against casual nostalgia. Entire sections, like the casino scene on Canto Bight, were far from perfect, but The Last Jedi was bold and inventive. It never invited us to point, ""LOOK, LANDO'S HERE!"" Instead, it did a fantastic job of shredding all fan expectations. It murdered its main villain halfway through the run time; transformed Luke Skywalker from a dull do-the-right-thing hero-type into a vicious, bitter hermit tortured by his own failings.  It was a film that paid testament to the weird imagination of the original trilogy, but refused to pander to the most basic tenets of its mythology. A vocal minority hated it, but for my money it was one of the bravest blockbuster movies of the last decade. It made me care about Star Wars again. In a post-Gamergate age, intense fandom has poisoned the well. The only response: Treat franchises like Star Wars and Marvel with indifference. If they rise above, like Into The Spider-Verse or Thor: Ragnarok? Great. If they don't? Ah well, it's just a movie. Taking it seriously is a losing game.  I made the crucial mistake that renders all fandom toxic: I was invested. As a teenager I devoured the Star Wars expanded universe. The good, the bad and The Courtship of Princess Leia. I was painfully in love with Star Wars as both a series and an idea. As an adult I had a huge amount of respect for the universe and the incredible movies it helped produce but now, post-Rise of Skywalker, I reckon I need a break from Star Wars. A long break.  May the Fourth be with you. Sure. I'd rather ignore it. It's a hashtag I'll be muting into oblivion. Because in a day that's supposed to be a celebration, there's not much to celebrate. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 1, 2022"," I was reading Room to Dream, David Lynch’s memoir-of-sorts, on the way to Star Wars: Episode IX—The Rise of Skywalker. For Lynch, writes his biographer/interlocuter Kristine McKenna, “The 1950s have never really gone away […] classic rock ‘n’ roll; diner waitresses wearing cute little caps; girls in bobby sox and saddle shoes, sweaters and pleated plaid skirts—these are elements of Lynch’s aesthetic vocabulary.” It then occurred to me to check whether Lynch and George Lucas are contemporaries, which they are (born 1/20/46 and 5/14/44, respectively). For Lynch, these images are eternally recurring, whereas Lucas got them out of his system exactly once, in American Graffiti (set in 1962, but an Eisenhower-era holdover if there ever was one). Lynch’s preoccupation with his formative years risks courting an “OK, boomer” response, but results in adventurous, progressive work. Lucas had a different relationship to his upbringing, in which memories of movie serials, and the way he reformulated their narrative lessons, turned out to have 40 years (and counting’s) worth of implications: this is, on some level, the revenge of the boomers, as we live in the distant, much-distorted echoes of their formative cultural intake. (As it turns out, even setting aside Lynch being offered Return of the Jedi, I’m not the first person to make a connection between these two directors.) A serial of serials, The Rise of Skywalker is a calamitously overstuffed series of exposition dumps, relentless incident and canon box-checking, like watching someone who’s on four hours of sleep and three Red Bulls try to do an immense task in as little time as possible so they can crash again—the movie is barreling through about three times as much information as it could reasonably bear. Amidst the rush to answer certain long-teased questions (who are Rey’s parents, will Kylo Ren abandon the dark side), there is an ungodly amount of connective tissue that keeps characters moving from one location to another to no particular end. There are very basic screenwriting problems, like something happening and then characters in the very next scene describing to each other what you just saw, information they have to deliver to each other to keep the plot moving. There is very little time for character detail or tossed-off lines at the margins, and Richard E. Grant appears to actively be at war with the material (which is actually pretty funny). All the characters you would expect to make one final cameo do, including Carrie Fisher, which is a major mistake: her lines are all generic unused filler, perceptibly responding to nothing onscreen, and there’s an unavoidable she’s-not-there component to her accidental performance. (It’s very funny that in this truly alternate universe, Adam Driver looks like he’s basically the same height as everybody else.) One of the weirdest side effects of this new Star Wars trilogy is the backlash narrative, promulgated by Breitbart and other unsavory players, that basically says a beloved, red-blooded American franchise for manly men has been hijacked by SJWs ramming progressive politics down viewer throats. There isn’t much to this: there’s the Gamergate-inflected argument that Daisy Ridley’s Rey is feminist propaganda (?), and also that Lucasfilm is now owned by Disney. Because Disney World now does Gay Pride, and releases content featuring queer people, it logically follows that they’ve found yet another outlet for nefarious social engineering. As patently nutsoid as this argument is (please, explain to me precisely which “progressive values” are represented by the new trilogy, as opposed to normalizing permanent warfare as a default premise for entertainment, or the anti-Vietnam War allegorical intent of the very first film), it has some kind of countermyth staying power. This reached some kind of fever pitch or other last week when Breitbart’s John Nolte got pumped as the cast and crew started trashing The Last Jedi, thereby vindicating him and all his fellow Deplorables: “But, but, but, I was told only racist, toxic, sexist, alt-right wannabe Hitlers didn’t care for Star Wars: The Last Jedi…? At least that’s what all the super-smart people with blue checkmarks on Twitter told me.” Again, this is insane, but here’s the thing: the new Star Wars has definite messaging, of the most useless #Resistance kind. Oscar Isaac gets to rally the rebellion’s troops, explaining that there’s more of “us” than there are of “them,” and that the empire succeeds by making people think they don’t have a chance. This is dangerously close to “…and that’s why the Democratic Party must rally around Joe Biden,” and it’s certainly not going to help anything get done. As for me: this is where I get off the Star Wars train. I was happy enough to wrap up some unfinished childhood business, although if they’d stopped at Force Awakens that would have done the job just as well. Lord/Miller being fired from Solo was a clear indication that no coloring outside certain margins would be accepted (Lawrence Kasdan’s vision must be respected!), so there’s very little chance further interesting work will be done in this terrain. After 40 years, everyone can go home, we’re done here.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 25, 2022"," What a roller-coaster adventure the last two years have been for Star Wars fans. Fair or not, Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” sparked all sorts of fan backlash, enough to prompt some to even blame it for the 2018 “Solo” movie’s disappointing box office numbers. Without question much of the outrage was over-the-top which caused many of the legitimate criticisms to be lost in the noise. But equally over-the-top was the critical praise, some of which heralded it as “the best Star Wars movie ever made”. Much of that was rooted in a needless lust for subversion and rabid contempt for fandom. In reality “The Last Jedi” had problems but it wasn’t the franchise killing disaster some have painted it as. Actually, outside of about 30 minutes of wildly uneven (and arguably bad) storytelling, it’s a movie with an assortment of big thrills and exciting moments. More importantly it left the story in a promising place and gave the characters plenty to reckon with. It ultimately set the table for “Rise of Skywalker” and the return of director and co-writer J.J. Abrams. Abrams clearly listened to the criticisms which has already triggered the predictable whines of “fan service” from certain critic circles. But Star Wars has always been about continuity and connection. Even the “stand-alone” movies are inherently connected to the films that came before them. So it makes sense that Abrams would try to rein in some of Johnson’s care-free creative choices. And as a movie tasked with wrapping up an entire four decade-plus saga, you almost have to expect some level of “fan service”. Here’s the important thing, the “fan service” we get in Episode IX isn’t half-baked or intrusive. Most of it is entertaining, nostalgic, and ultimately satisfying. Cool callbacks of all kinds pop up throughout the movie, lots of it genuinely in service to the story while other bits are simply there for the fun of it. Do they go a little overboard? Perhaps. But whether or not it is a dealbreaker for you probably depends on how you’re approaching this film as a whole. “Skywalker” gets off to a shaky (and frankly concerning) start. The first twenty minutes or so sees Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio bouncing us from one location to another while never letting us plant our feet. There is some snazzy scenery and a couple of decent action sequences, but they’re kinda lost in the film’s manic rush to get the story and the characters to where they need to be. But once the narrative pieces are put in place, the movie slows down a bit and gets into a more manageable rhythm. The movie’s most captivating storyline remains the mysterious connection between young and raw Jedi extraordinaire Rey (Daisy Ridley) and tortured dark sider Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Rey works hard to hone her skills but is still haunted by questions of her identity. Kylo (who steals the movie) uses every ounce of rage he can muster to smother out the glimmer of light within him. Both Ridley and Driver approach most of their scenes with a steely intensity befitting of their characters and their inevitable collision course. As for another big plus, “Skywalker” finally gives the trilogy’s heroes some meaningful screentime together. Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and of course BB-8 go off on a Sinbad-like quest (look that reference up kids) to find an artifact once sought by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). It’s believed to contain the location of a Wayfinder that will lead them to a Sith planet where a new dark force has emerged. It turns out Kylo Ren has a Wayfinder of his own and has ventured to the sinister planet. While there he discovers a way to turn his terrorizing First Order into a bigger and truly unstoppable force. But it requires that he kill his one biggest threat – Rey. So as the rag-tag band of heroes look for a way to the Sith planet, the First Order scours the entire galaxy in pursuit of them. Despite the seriousness of their mission, there are always moments of levity especially between playful best bros Poe and Finn. But it’s C-3PO who turns out to be the biggest ham. He’s the perfect punchline for several jokes but he also has some cracking comedic lines of his own. It’s just a shame R2-D2 was left back at the Rebel base with practically nothing to do. The same could be said for Lando (Billy Dee Williams). Who wasn’t thrilled to see the good-hearted gambler returning to the franchise? But he just conveniently pops up with little explanation and then quickly fades into the background. And as you might expect, we get several new characters entering the galaxy far, far away for the first time. Among the best, Keri Russell’s Zori Bliss, a shady old acquaintance of Poe’s. It’s not a big role, but Zori has a background fans will love to explore. Richard E. Grant is a hoot playing the sour and ever-serious Allegiant General Pryde of the First Order. Grant chews up his lines in classic imperial officer fashion. We don’t quite get enough of his story, but he’s a fun and interesting presence. And Star Wars knows how to do droids. New here is D-O, affectionately called “conehead” by Poe. Again, small role but tender and quite funny. Abrams does do some patchwork to several of Rian Johnson’s more controversial choices: Rey’s parents, Supreme Leader Snoke, etc. The movie addresses them in a way that should please many of the fans while infuriating those who couldn’t care less about Star Wars continuity or lore. But let’s be serious, “The Rise of Skywalker” had no chance of pleasing everyone. It was a hopeless proposition. So, do you follow Johnson’s lead and kick more sand in the eyes of long-time fans? Or do you make a movie for the devoted fanbase and face the ire of scorned critics? Sadly, an unnecessary chasm between critics and fans is all but certain and is already blazing across social media. The film will probably be held to a ridiculously high standard (by fans AND critics) and unhelpful comparisons to the original trilogy are all but inevitable. It’s a shame because “Rise of Skywalker” is pure entertainment – fun, at times thrilling, with a steady tinge of franchise nostalgia and an emotional punch at the end. It’s far from perfect. The story is messy, there’s enough plot to fill two movies, and some of its characters need more attention. But this is still very much a Star Wars film and will evoke many of those same old feelings of kid-like joy and excitement for those who allow it. I’m glad this worked for you, but I am so bitterly disappointed. I wanted so badly to like this and it sucks when something you love so much ends on a terrible note.  Awww, sorry to hear. I’m such a die-hard SW fan and I tend to digest these movies a lot differently than most. I had a really good time with it. My biggest gripe is that it had enough material for two movies. All this fandom and whiney moaners is a bit bonkers, I’m not sure if the same thing goes on with the Marvel or DC movies, probably, but I don’t think it’s as vitriolic as the Star Wars mob. Jeez people, it’s just a godamned movie, 🙄🤣 glad you enjoyed it anyway, Sean over at Assholes had similar feelings as yourself about it, so am thinking it was mostly OK. One day, in a TV room far far away (well 12 feet at least anyway) I will watch the SW movies in order, have only seen the first three. This has turned into a really weird thing partly because of tender-footed ‘fans’ and anti-fan critics. It’s really hard to have a rational discussion about this series these days. I really enjoyed it. I don’t think it had as strong an impact as a closing chapter as it could have. I think Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith both stuck the landing a bit better. Yet I found it a blast. I kinda wish some of those early reviews didn’t seem to pit it as a Last Jedi vs the world situation. It felt like the knives were out just because it tried not to be divisive like The Last Jedi.  Yep, it’s unfortunate who the division over TLJ is actually showing itself in many critic reviews. My only real gripe on this one is that it felt rushed which left some storylines feeling underserved. My son made the comment that there was enough material here for two movies. The Last Jedi by Rian Johnson is the only movie in the trilogy that somewhat works and is because is the one movie JJ Abrams did NOT write, NOT direct.  That’s interesting because The Last Jedi is easily my least favorite SW movie. It’s a film full of incredible moments but an absolute mess of a script.  You do realize THAT doesn’t help ease the discourse right? I’m a long time fan since I watched the original trilogy in theaters, during the initial release of Return Of The Jedi. Well I loved both The Force Awakens AND The Last Jedi, but I still enjoyed The Rise Of Skywalker. How do I fit in your narrative? It doesn’t sound like you do fit into my “narrative”. I too watched all of the original films at the theater. Loved them. Watched all of the prequel trilogy on the big screen. I like those films. Watched all the sequel trilogy including TLJ in theaters. Liked them too. So it sounds like I’m coming from the angle as you. So I take it what you wrote there was done tongue in cheek then? Because it seemed Rian Johnson did write TLJ for the devoted fanbase. He actually covers themes and story threads that started in the prequels, and continued in Clone Wars and Rebels. He’s rewarding fans who are deep into Star Wars lore and history, by acknowledging what those entrees contributed to the whole mythology. How is that considered kicking sand in the eyes of long time fans? Which is why I like the movie (even wrote a recent piece defending the Luke Skywalker depiction). But at the same time he also chose to be subversive in an episode titled Episode VIII and clearly did so with little thought of fan reactions. This was essentially reinforced by recent defensive comments about “pandering” to fans.  But my comments were framed in the form of two questions which (unfortunately) represents the two most vocal sides of the responses. As I’ve alluded to on my site and in the review, I don’t subscribe to either. I certainly don’t blame Abrams for going a different route. But also my problems with TLJ was more about storytelling flaws than what most ‘fans’ are still fussing about. I’m seeing this tomorrow morning and I’ve already lowered my expectations (though I tend to keep it low).  At least it’s not fucking Cats.  The image of Rebel Wilson eating CGI cockroaches already made me throw up as I’m still dealing with flu-like illnesses in coughs, runny noses, and a sore throat. Ya know part of me wants to see “Cats” just to witness its horror. But another part of me doesn’t want to give them a dime of my money. So we are watching Star Wars again. Haven’t seen it yet, but I did get the sense that at least some critics are just looking for a reason not to like it.  Kind of like the last one hurt their feelings and they are getting even. It does seem like Abrams didn’t have a chance with some critics. I had a lot of fun despite its flaws. Seeing it again tomorrow.  (SPOILERS)))))))))That whole potential love triangle was weird and then just vanished. Was he going to tell her he loved her, that Poe loved, or what? TLJ ends with that odd Finn and Rose kiss, Poe seems to have feelings for Rey but they Zorii comes along and there is clearly a spark there, and then Rey has her kiss moment with somebody totally different. The three of them all hug at the end which I think is the best scenario – they are simply the best of friends. Lots of loose ends and side roads that lead nowhere.  Some one above mentioned how Revenge of the Sith,  an Return to the Jedi both stuck the landing for their respective series and this one doesn’t quite do that,  I have to agree. Rushed and patched together it meets fan expectations for nostalgia in several places, but that often leaves the story we should be following dangling.  The last trilogy feels cobbled together,  as if they had only the most general idea of where they were heading,  and they tried to work it out as they went along. Emotional satisfaction was low for me, but as usual,  the spectacle  was solid. Maybe it will work better on subsequent viewing,  but that is not the way I think I should have to go with a Star Wars movie. That kind of speaks to one of my biggest gripes – there was enough material here for two movies. Obviously though, that doesn’t fit into the trilogy format. (SPOILERS))))))) Things like Leia teaching Rey in the ways of the force. That’s a pretty big thing that needs more attention than a brief flashback of Luke training Leia. Same with Rey’s parents. The revelation is interesting but it still needed more attention. Good review, Keith. I agree with your point, it’s messy but it’s enjoyable. I guess for me, it was not a good the end film for the franchise, but oh well. Wow. Haven’t felt Anakin’s story impacted much at all by this other than it was his grandson and a new Jedi trained by his children who ultimately ended the Sith threat. Still, a better movie than TLJ for me. Anakin’s whole reason to turn to dark side? Here Kylo and Rey can just heal the others, just like that. Anakin’s prophecy? LOL Emperor and all the shit is back. Anakin also helps this random chick and doesn’t help his own grandson. I’d say that is some impact. Saving Padme was in Anakin’s mind but it was fed to him by Palpatine who then exploited it to his advantage. But in Episode III Palpatine alluded to these very powers we see in this film and even see from Baby Yoda. And I’m not sure how Anakin could help his grandson. He’s been dead since well before Kylo was born. Man, you hear Anakin’s voice rooting for Rey. He says nothing to Ben. You have Luke literally lift a plane for her. Are you really not sure how he could help when you have force ghosts doing this? What’s the different that Palpatine told him about it? You now have two characters having that power out of nowhere for really no reason other than playing ping pong with life force. Why would we think that Anakin’s force ghost would suddenly appear when the only time we’ve ever even seen it is standing next to Yoda and Obi-Wan in Return of the Jedi? He has literally zero presence other than in voices some of which were manipulations of Palpatine. As for Rey having her power, we learn she has many powers she doesn’t realize she has. Sith lightning anyone? I don’t know, to me them having healing powers doesn’t ruin things. It just speaks to the criticism I have mentioned, that there is too much material here for just one movie. And the only reason for him not having presence is because the writers didn’t include him when they could and should. It’s the worst script for a blockbuster I saw in years. You have the Sith messing with Ben his entire life and the Jedi never intervening once when they all do for Rey in the end. It’s indefensible. Luke (trying to rebuild the Jedi) was literally training Ben when he turned to the Dark Side. He was trying to help him. The ghosts didn’t appear to Ben after he turned but that’s not unusual. They never appeared to Vader either. I suppose they could have appeared to Ben before he turned. But don’t Force ghosts only appear to those they had personal connections with? What a fantastic review, I can’t help but agree with you on how this film will most certainly not eliminate any grievances people have had since the beginning of the new era of films. Your review is honestly the most fair I’ve seen yet. Thank you so much. Appreciate you checking it out. I just finished watching it a second time and I definitely stand by my score. It’s a strong 4 stars. I even liked it better a second time because I picked up on so many more things I had missed. That’s what I’m hoping will happen for me too. I always feel that the best way to handle an opinion is by giving whatever it is a second chance.  The movie throws so much at you and it can be a little overwhelming on the first viewing. But this time I knew where the story was going so I could pay closer attention to the details. Picked up several things that gave me some clarity.  As a big fan of The Last Jedi who generally sides more with the Lucasfilm and their creative choices than with the more vocal fans… I absolutely love The Rise of Skywalker (just got back from seeing it)!  An epic, satisfying, resonating conclusion to the Skywalker Saga and the Trilogy of Trilogies. I had so much fun with it especially after a second viewing. Do yourself a favor and watch it a second time. You’ll notice so many more things you may have missed in the first viewing. Oh, I’m almost definitely going for a second viewing!  Such a lot of fun.  Loved all the easter eggs/references to almost all of the previous movies. Solid review mate. Have to say as a massive fan of TLJ I was disappointed by a lot of the storytelling aspects of this film, but I did enjoy it in the moment. My own review reflects my dismay at the seemingly offhanded way JJ and Co tried to tie up all the disparate plot points – the revelation of Rey’s parentage, while shocking, wasn’t given anywhere near enough time to bake into the audience’s brain, IMO – within the film’s lengthy timeframe. It’s also a shame at the obvious shade thrown at TLJ in such a snarky manner (the scene with Force Ghost Luke and the lighsabre, most obviously) which left me with a sour taste in the mouth. Performances were generally good considering: in my own review I write that the characters weren’t given dialogue so much as they were given exposition, the difference between the two being that dialogue allows the characters to grow, whilst exposition allows the characters to go. The latter, whilst important, robs a lot of character beats from the story and results in a thinner, less emotional film (again, IMO), and this is the crucial deficit the film has. That said, the visuals are spectacular, the sound mix astonishing (I think the subwoofers in the cinema I saw this in couldn’t handle the LFE Abrams threw at us, they were bottoming out) and the music again was among the highlights. Time will tell how the Sequel Trilogy holds up but for me Rise Of Skywalker was a disappointment compared to the relatively even-handed earlier two films. Those are completely fair criticisms. I guess I didn’t really have a problem with Luke’s scene mainly because he is in such a different place by the end of TLJ than he was when he pitched the lightsaber. I could see him saying the same thing at that point in the previous film. It’s one reason I never had a problem with how TLJ treated Luke. You’re right, there is a lot of exposition. But I also felt it had several good emotional punches. And one reason I like it better than TLJ is because it doesn’t have any pointless and befuddling sequences like the Casino planet excursion. My biggest gripe (and you touch on it) is that several details in this movie needed more time and attention. You’re 100% right about the Palpatine revelation. Also the whole idea of Leia being trained in the force by Luke. That seems like such a major bit of information yet we get a brief flashback image and a few words from Luke and that’s about it. In their defense though, I saw an interview where Abrams said they had more planned but obviously with Carrie Fisher‘s death they were much more limited than they intended to be. Great review as ever Keith. I appreciated your wider perspective of the film by trying to tie it to the perception of The Last Jedi and the almost impossible task that Abrams had.  I liked the film and would call it a good Star Wars film. This is mostly down to Rey’s arc and subsequent internal wrestle with her lineage. It feels so in keeping with the franchise and its themes. Thanks so much. I’m glad you enjoyed it too. I know some people walked away disappointed but I had a lot of fun with it. Then again, I view all of these movies as a whole. Some episodes are better than others but they all come together to form something I always have and always will love. That’s an excellent point. It’s a big story that’s split into different chapters. And with that comes weak and strong entries etc. Endings are especially tricky and I would have liked to have seen the social media reaction/general consensus for Return of the Jedi and Revenge of the Sith.  Much like some of the reviews at the time, I don’t think The Empire Strikes Back would be as enamoured if it were released during the era of social media.  Trying to digest everything that went down after seeing it , is like taking in too much pie and struggling to swallow it lol But I will say there was in my opinion much course correction going on from The Last Jedi . I was not a fan of that movie over all , although the performances were solid , Johnson made choices that I really disliked and it was clear JJ took to heart the anger of many fans . The first part was a bit muddled but once it got going , it was frenetic pace . They dealt decently with the death of Fisher limiting what could have been in this movie . I felt there where tons of fan service but I was quite happy with that . The scene that featured Han talking to Ben Solo/Kylo Ren had more impact and heart for me than it the scene in the Force Awakens. Plus it was great to see Lando back and to see Luke as a force ghost was great . Still not sold on the Emperor return and how that all went down but my I might need to see it again before I can rate it fairly . As it stands , my view still stands that this whole series of movies was unneeded but here we are . So without being too nit picky , a solid 7.5 . Definitely see it again. You’re right, there is so much to follow and process during a first viewing. You spend a lot of time just trying to keep up with plot points especially during the first act. But my second viewing was really great mainly because I knew where the story was going so I could just focus on the details, characters, etc. It opened the movie up even more to me. I get what you’re saying about Palpatine, but think of it this way. From episode one all the way to this movie this really is a saga of too powerful families, the Skywalkers and the Palpatines. All three trilogies have this in common. So I found it kind of cool that the final movie of the saga dealt with that story thread and brought it to a conclusion. Just a thought. That is true and I thought that by Rey being saved by a Skywalker and her rejecting the name of her grandfather and adopting Skywalker, it brings a piece to the force. Just my observation.But I’m going again this weekend, and I also agree, the pace may slow down a bit so I will able to see the movie in a clearer light . The pace issue made a world of difference. Being able to sit back and take in the details paints things in a new light. Hoping to see it one more time before it leaves the big screen. Great review Keith and I’m glad you enjoyed Rise of Skywalker.  I liked it fine and was entertained but as the end of a trilogy and a saga it was a little weak – looking forward to the Mandalorian when we get Disney+ here in the UK at the end of March! Oh gosh! I forget you guys are still waiting on Mandalorian! That’s just terrible. I’m sure there are things behind the scenes that I just don’t understand, but it stinks that there is such a huge gap between release dates. Yeah, it’s seemingly all down to the various contracts/licensing agreements Disney has with different outlets worldwide, which need to expire before Disney+ can go live.  Looking forward to it!",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2022"," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, the creators of the new Star Wars Trilogy must be dedicated environmentalists, because they keep recycling the same old material over and over and over. I’m not sure if it’s my fond memories of my childhood re-watching the original Star Wars series that have me holding the JJ Abrams-helmed incarnation to a higher standard. The mastermind behind Lost clearly has his heart in the right place; you can agree, even more so, when you compare it to the great George Lucas merchandise six-year cash grabs at the turn of the century. The passion for it is there. The visual effects are more than impressive, and there are a few mild moments of rare inspiration, but that’s usually reserved from the droids (and Anthony Daniels’ gift of the gab and comic timing). Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker, while an improvement over the last two, can’t hold a light-saber to Rogue One, and has an emotional payoff that’s akin to Bill Murray trying to recapture the magic in several scenes with Andie McDowell in Groundhog Day. I’m starting to wonder if a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, Abrams and Chris Terrio, the writers of the newest Star Wars Trilogy, must be dedicated environmentalists, because they keep recycling the same-old material over and over and over. Every time when the gang goes off to find a piece of the puzzle, right after they complete their task, the bad guys show up to ruin their fun. The same plotlines are recycled from previous chapters, so there is hardly any suspense that built or had. The script also, especially with the modern film trilogy, relies on cringe-worthy dialogue. Remember when we used to get gems like, “Why, you stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf herder!.” Now we get, in particular when it comes to transitioning scenes, a line that usually goes to something like, “Wait,“ and then repeat the exact same line like deja-vu (usually John Boyega’s Finn is saddled with this task). Even the same tropes and MacGuffin’s are on autopilot and are used as standards here. That would all be fine or at least condoned if the casting was right from the start. The original big three of Hamill, Ford, and Fisher had great chemistry, as a unit, or in a separate one on one encounter. Their conflict made things interesting. Here, their current “throuple” interactions, conflict, or buddy-time, is forced and unnatural. Oscar Isaac, God love him for everything else he acts in, is swinging and missing when it comes to being the comic, swashbuckling relief that Harrison Ford perfected 40 years earlier. Boyega’s Finn has been relegated to screaming a character’s name and staring at Rey with puppy-dog eyes. It’s a hoot to see some old characters return, but more screen time would have been appreciated for new additions like Keri Russel’s Zori Bliss. The special effects are top-notch, and there is value in telling a story simply and competently, even if repeated, as it is entertainment product that has had consistent success and many love, after all. Adam Driver, besides the natural head of black hair that looks like Darth Vadar’s helmet, is a gifted actor and makes for an interesting villain. As mentioned before, Anthony Daniels is the main source of comic relief with his sharp timing and pitch perfect delivery. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and this current trilogy, for that matter, belongs to Daisy Ridley. It’s an incredibly hard role to fill and pull off, emotionally and physically. It may be, and might not receive praise as, the best performance in an action-adventure series in recent memory. She is the heart and soul of this franchise and it’s the perfect fit for the decade that is finally recognizing strong, smart, confident female characters. Overall, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of the Skywalker prove, if anything, you can’t go home again. Yes, they aren’t remakes. These are new films, but they are similar and feel like a repackaged holiday gift from the Aunt who says she can’t afford much but spends her Winters in Boca Rotan. If you enjoy the series, I am glad, you got your money’s worth. Though, you should demand more for your dollar. Especially at today’s prices and the amount of money spent on technical production, this could have afforded a rewrite from a script doctor not that far, far away. Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website. Since a young age, Marc dreamed of becoming a legitimate critic and having that famous “Rotten Tomato” approved status – in 2023, he achieved that status.",NEUTRAL

A payoff 42 years in the making, this ninth episode in the three-trilogy cycle of films that began with 1977's Star Wars (later subtitled A New Hope) is a rip-snorter of a big-budget big-screen adventure. True to the spirit of both the schlocky serials and high-art Japanese cinema that originally inspired George Lucas in his epic visionary story-telling, this film has literally something for everybody - tipping the hat to, inviting back on set or channelling the after-life spirit of practically every character and storyline from the franchise.  There's a lot of backstory to know and anyone walking in cold with this as their first film in the series will wonder what the people in the cinema around them are laughing, crying or air-punching over with such force.  In the first three films, a young man is identified as being gifted in the mystical Force and trained by a group of galactic police, the Jedi Knights, while his girlfriend makes a career transition from Queen to Senator. Her work mentor, it turns out, is secretly the head of an army of anti-Jedis called the Sith who orchestrate to wipe the Jedi from the face of the galaxy. Thwarted in his career ambitions, the young man allows himself to be head-hunted, throws on some dark soldier togs and retitles himself Darth Vader, while his girlfriend gives birth to their twin children, and dies.  In the second three films, the separated-at-birth twins Luke and Leia are grown up, know nothing about their origin story but find themselves fighting side-by-side against Darth Vader, now 2-I-C to the evil Emperor. Dad eventually sides with the kids and deals the evil Empire a gut punch.  Hero of the third trilogy of films is Rey (Daisy Ridley) whom we met in 2015's The Force Awakens as an orphaned scavenger of scrap metal whose plumb find is a robot (""droid"" in these films) that knows where long-lost Jedi Luke Skywalker has hidden himself. Rey finds herself immersed in the still-active Rebellion, headed up by Leia, now a General and mother to Ben Solo (Adam Driver) whose teenage rebellion has turned very dark. Young Ben has learned his mother and uncle's Jedi skills but has turned to the dark side, dressing up as his grandfather Vader and calling himself Kylo Ren.  Like Hamlet, Kylo/Ben holds his grandfather's skull aloft while pondering his place in the universe. Is he good or is he bad? He isn't wrong for wondering this. After all, his mother is the leader of a group of domestic terrorists and since he and Rey defeated the evil Snoke in 2017's The Last Jedi, he is Acting Secretary in the galaxy far far away's Department of Home Affairs, the ""First Order"".  Kylo/Ben feels a unique connection to Rey, whose Jedi skills under Leia's tutelage have grown to match his own, and thinks she should join him on the throne, but it turns out the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) didn't die and has plans for the pair.  That is just one strand of dozens of plots that find a resolution in The Rise of Skywalker's screenplay as written by J.J. Abrams and Justice League scribe Chris Terrio, even if Abrams the director doesn't give you viewer too much time between plot moments to appreciate or react. Abrams and Terrio are obviously big George Lucas fans because this film not only addresses but honours practically every wish a fan might have had.  Almost every peripheral character from the series makes an appearance, gets a resolution. Every droid has their moment in the sun, with one making a tear-jerking noble sacrifice. One of the production team's greatest accomplishments is to keep Carrie Fisher's General Leia Organa front-and-centre to the action throughout, despite Fisher having died before the previous film wrapped. There's many reasons I'll be wanting to rewatch this film multiple times, and the first few repeat viewings will be to work out where these shots might have come from.  Missing from the film is any real sense of danger for the characters. Despite being the theoretical final installment, Disney shelled out billions of dollars to acquire the intellectual property from George Lucas, and it was hard to imagine they'd risk any future possible spin-off or toy income with a Tarantino Hateful Eight-style no-man-gets-out-of-here-alive finale.  Generations of families have grown up with these characters. I once got called into the office of my son's daycare principal for a dressing-down after he was caught mimicking the double-lightsaber decapitation scene from Revenge of the Sith. We both still pretend we're opening the automatic doors in shopping malls with The Force. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 7, 2022"," “Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker”, la última entrega de la saga Skywalker. Era imposible no emocionarme, Star Wars es lo que es y no importa qué tiene un espacio muy especial en mí y por tanto, mis gustos. El episodio 9 mantiene su rigidez a base de pura nostalgia, entretenimiento y complacer a los fanáticos.  La película es tan complaciente que por momentos tira la lógica y la continuidad de los eventos de las películas pasadas por la borda. No puedo dejar de aceptar que aveces me encontraba pensando que lo estaba ocurriendo no hacía sentido y hasta se sentía apresurado y/o fuera de lugar (efecto “Game of Thrones"").  Pero siendo totalmente sincero, me sentí por completo en otra galaxia. Me emocioné cuando me tenía que emocionar, me entristecí cuando tuve que hacerlo, me sorprendí y hasta salté de la emoción a veces.

"Feb 22, 2022"," If Rian Johnson upset a segment of Star Wars fans by subverting expectations and taking the franchise in a new direction with The Last Jedi (2017), then J.J. Abrams could be faulted for not following the new course with his sequel, Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker. Johnson’s divisive film introduced alternative ideas and thematic deviations into the Star Wars mythology, inventing sometimes oddball story elements (Leia using the Force to pull herself through space) that clashed with the first six episodes overseen by George Lucas—whose integrity Abrams jealously preserved in his entertaining 2015 reboot, The Force Awakens. Some of The Last Jedi‘s detractors felt that while change is welcome and needed for a franchise to endure, Johnson’s film did not follow the episodic progression implied with Star Wars’ roots in Saturday matinee serials. The Last Jedi is a well-made film, often gorgeous and thrillingly acted, but in the sequential order of things, it sticks out like a sore thumb. After Johnson’s film incited ridiculous protests and online petitions to have it stricken from the canon, the Disney overseers have attempted to course-correct with The Rise of Skywalker, a cinematic apology to fans for tampering with their hallowed grounds.  That’s where Star Wars fandom stands today. The discourse about films of this sort has degraded to such a degree that viewers now demand studios make their franchise movies in the manner they expect and feel entitled. All else is jettisoned, denied as a part of their selective reality. When the theatrical version of Justice League (2017) underwhelmed, online communities demanded that Warner Bros. release director Zack Snyder’s original cut. When The Last Jedi challenged the rules of Star Wars, fans clamored and asked that it be stricken from the record and remade. And if The Rise of Skywalker is any indication, Disney listens to the most vocal protestors and endeavors to appease them. After all, the House of Mouse desperately wants to gratify fans, if only to ensure the billion-dollar potential of each new Star Wars film. Given such pandering and the ever-discontent fanbase, Star Wars has become, for this critic, a low, exhausting state of affairs that discourages further enthusiasm about anything having to do with this franchise.  Star Wars has been wildly inconsistent from the start. Plot holes and story inconsistencies run rampant throughout the original trilogy. Later, Lucas’ abortive prequel trilogy, marred by early CGI characters that appear laughable by today’s standards, cheapened the franchise by demystifying the originals. Meanwhile, Disney’s now-complete trilogy has a manic dramatic arc, reflected by the wildly impulsive motivations of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who teeter-totter between the Dark Side and the light, often within the same episode. Whereas the first two trilogies each have an overarching story that spans their three films, Disney’s Star Wars output seems to be making it up as it goes along. Everything from the individual episodes and maligned spinoffs (Rogue One and Solo) feel like nothing more than disorganized fan fiction. It’s a studio trying, desperately, to manage its audience rather than tell a story. As a result, the characters from The Force Awakens rarely feel like the same characters from The Last Jedi or The Rise of Skywalker.  With that in mind, Abrams’ new episode, which he co-wrote alongside Chris Terrio (who wrote Justice League no less) from a story with contributions by Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, tries to reset the franchise’s forward momentum to something resembling where he started with The Force Awakens. Abrams has already established himself as Hollywood’s defacto rebooter of franchises (see his Mission: Impossible III and Star Trek). And while his latest stops short of pretending The Last Jedi never happened, it uses a considerable amount of energy on shifting the overarching story away from where Johnson had pointed it. Instead, he concentrates on satiating the audience with nostalgia and correcting the perceived mistakes of the past. For instance, Abrams tidies up the plot holes that have existed since The Empire Strikes Back (1980), where Leia (Carrie Fisher) was propped up as “another” hope in place of Luke, but nothing ever happened with that. In The Rise of Skywalker, there’s a brief flashback of Luke (Mark Hamill) training his sister in the ways of the Jedi, which would explain why she has Jedi abilities later in life.  While Abrams builds upon the integrity of Johnson’s film with flashbacks that explain why Leia had the Jedi mastery to pull herself through space, he’s less generous elsewhere. On the question of Luke’s monk-like solitude and aversion to the ancient Jedi texts in Johnson’s film, Luke makes a stark admission here: “I was wrong.” Indeed, Abrams undoes many of the most potent alterations in The Last Jedi, such as moving the story away from Johnson’s rallying theme built around the average nobody. Abrams also rethinks the last film’s sudden shifts in character. Kylo Ren, who destroyed his Darth Vader-inspired helmet in Johnson’s film in an act of independence from his grandfather’s example, repairs the mask now, making him look appropriately fractured. After all, as a result of the back-and-forth between Abrams’ and Johnson’s films, cracked identities are what drive Disney’s trilogy. Ever split between his draw to the Dark Side and his parents’ hero legacy, Kylo Ren can’t decide which path to take. Neither can Rey, who was led to believe her parents were nobodies in The Last Jedi. However, Abrams changes that too, revealing a twist that not only upends Johnson’s film but better justifies her impulse to reach into the darkest corners of her identity. In this film, she once again must confront her Dark Side, personified by a hooded evil twin with a double-edged lightsaber.  When The Rise of Skywalker opens, everyone’s looking for Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), whose presence has returned to the galaxy in the form of a Frankensteined-together cyborg. As it turns out, Palpatine has been controlling the voices in Kylo Ren’s head, using the puppeteered Snoke, clones, and astral projection (or something) to build the empire’s First Order into the new “Final Order” for his hooded, chanting Sith army. Palpatine even promises Kylo Ren the galaxy if he kills the last remaining Jedi, Rey. In another part of the galaxy, our heroes—Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and a posse of droids—scramble to find Palpatine on the hidden planet Exegol, but to do that, they need a MacGuffin called a Sith Wayfinder. Abrams and Terrio have structured most of their film around gathering one MacGuffin that leads to another MacGuffin and so on, propelling our heroes from one planet to the next in search of a plot device. Much like the superfluousness of The Last Jedi’s casino planet interlude, there’s a subplot or two that feel unnecessary, giving the film an excuse to check fan service boxes. All the while, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), so important in Johnson’s film to establish its themes that anyone can be a hero, has been reduced to a minor supporting role.  The extraneous plotting pushes the runtime over 140 minutes, which gives the filmmakers ample time to engage the viewer’s sense of nostalgia and bring finality to the nine-episode saga. Abrams has exhumed beloved characters and images from earlier films to accomplish this farewell-of-a-movie, which attempts to close the “Skywalker Saga” that began with The Phantom Menace (1999)—technically, A New Hope (1977). Besides the resurrected Palpatine, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) make appearances as a ghost and a projected memory, respectively. In a different sort of resurrection, the late Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016 before The Last Jedi hit theaters, appears as a CGI character constructed of outtakes from Johnson and Abrams’ previous episodes—demonstrating that Disney no longer needs actors to create convincing performances (admittedly, the effect looks better than the young Fisher in Rogue One). Both Chewbacca and C-3PO meet their demise in The Rise of Skywalker, and each of them experiences a type of rebirth a few scenes later. Billy Dee Williams appears once more as Lando Calrissian, looking relaxed in a role he last played a quarter-century ago. The film even dredges up the Death Star. The resurrection motif becomes tiresome, if only because it spends more time reflecting on the past than advancing the story. But then, that’s just what Abrams does.  Even as major characters show up for their obligatory goodbye to the fanbase, the few innovations in the film remain uninspired, confusing, and downright silly. The Rise of Skywalker introduces the idea that Rey’s powerful grasp of the Force allows her to miraculously heal injuries, a skill she masters on the first try, despite her abilities proving unwieldy in another scene that leads to an accidental shuttle explosion. Also, running with an idea from The Last Jedi that Kylo Ren and Rey converse using Force-based telepathy, Abrams mounts psychic lightsaber duels where the boundaries of each duellist’s location begin to overlap with the other. He takes this idea even further when psychic projections become tangible objects, leading to a type of lightsaber teleportation in one scene. The bond between these two characters also has some curious implications about the sheer power they share when together, but I’m not sure I understand it, perhaps because, like most everything else in this film, it’s breezed over—including a last-minute romantic turn. At last, in the final duel between Palpatine and Rey, they fight as “All the Sith” versus “All the Jedi” in a ridiculous battle of energy beams that settles the matter once and for all (for now).  This is a deliriously paced film that barely leaves a moment for the viewer to process what’s happening. That comes later. If his other work is any indication, Abrams is a propulsive director of action driven by faces, chases, and places. His films rush from one disaster to the next, during which the viewer cannot breathe, much less absorb every plot detail. In the first scenes, the Millenium Falcon zips through an ice shaft, pursued by enemy fighters, while the characters spout expositional dialogue amid the occasional “That was a close one!” It’s difficult to say what’s happening or why, but boy, is it exciting. Editors Maryann Brandon and Stefan Grube maintain the film’s breakneck pacing, yet they hardly leave time for us to access the emotional center of these characters and their many motivational shifts. Later, Kylo Ren and Rey’s lightsaber duel on the Death Star’s half-submerged ruins, an image of grandiosity to be sure, goes on and on ad nauseam. But there’s no consequence to the scene, apart from neat-looking action. Abrams has directed The Rise of Skywalker into meme-worthy moments that have no greater consequence, but they can be easily shared on social media to facilitate cultural saturation.  Capably made but misguided in its attempts to satiate its fanbase, The Rise of Skywalker marks some kind of end to the franchise. It’s a film that tries to please everyone and, in doing so, crams so much into its harried story that it seldom feels inspired. The sheer number of reference points, callbacks, phantoms, and delusions in this film leaves too much to disentangle with any logical acceptance. But nostalgia isn’t about logic; it’s about emotions, and the feelings of preciousness about the original trilogy have sustained millions of moviegoers through more bad episodes than good in my estimation. Taking a step back and looking at this new trilogy, Disney’s Star Wars episodes have proven quite erratic, robbing the material of its serial appeal. When so much about Kylo Ren and Rey proves almost bipolar, it’s difficult to invest oneself in their fates as heroes or villains. Much like its immediate predecessor The Last Jedi, the viewer’s lizard brain leaves the theater thoroughly entertained. Maybe that’s enough to justify a bucket of popcorn and some escapist viewership, but not much more. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 21, 2022"," These are dark times for the Disney Empire. The unified celebration that greeted its first two Star Wars entries (The Force Awakens and Rogue One) descended into rebellion with the release of The Last Jedi, one of the most divisive films in recent memory. Then came Solo, the first Star Wars movie to lose money.  With future plans in flux, this is the last big screen adventure for the moment, with the franchise finding success in TV with The Mandalorian. Following the departure of original director Colin Trevorrow, JJ Abrams has returned to close out the journey he started with The Force Awakens.  One criticism of his previous film was that it leaned too heavily on nostalgia. If that’s a problem for you, then The Rise of Skywalker is going to be a bumpy ride. Every possible reference and Easter Egg you can think of is jammed into this carnival of fan service. But once the sugar rush of sentiment fades, it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life.  We catch up with Rey (Daisy Ridley) still fighting against both The First Order, and the dark visions of her own future. On the other side is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with Rey.  But once the sugar rush of sentiment fades, it becomes clear these baubles are a distraction from a plot with no life. We catch up with Rey (Daisy Ridley) still fighting against both The First Order, and the dark visions of her own future. On the other side is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), racked with guilt at the deeds of his past and unsure what to make of his connection with Rey.  The trouble is, we’re not too sure what to make of it either. This is a conclusion for characters who haven’t been given time to breathe, the results of varying artistic and commercial visions that feel incomplete. Without the requisite development, we get supposedly climactic confrontations that are important only because the script says they are. Most of the contentious aspects of The Last Jedi are reworked or forgotten quickly, with certain twists feeling like a direct response to fan outrage. Whether these changes are right or wrong is subjective, but they come too late in the game to be implemented naturally. In short, the ending feels empty when we’re asked to forget about the middle.  This isn’t to say it’s a disaster. The visual spectacle is awesome, from nightmarish caves to roiling oceans. It feels like a galaxy far, far away, and one you’d quite like to visit. There’s also plenty of fun moments as we accompany Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and various others as they race between planets, interacting with cute new sidekicks vying for Baby Yoda’s crown.  There are thrilling fights, funny jokes, and, aside from the often excruciating dialogue (never really a strong point in the Star Wars universe), it’s a fine experience.  And that’s the problem: Star Wars has never been just ‘fine’. Whether you left the cinema punching the air or seething with rage, every one of these stories made you feel something.  Even the worst entries had moments that took your breath away. For all the visual effects, all the speeches, it’s hard to think of a moment in this film that anyone will be referencing in 20 years. Trying to please everyone has resulted in a film that’s apparently happy to be average. All of a sudden, Star Wars doesn’t feel special anymore.  Most cheated by all the indecision are the younger cast members, who do their best with characters who have been pulled in different directions over the course of three films. Isaac’s Poe fares best out of them all, showing some progression as he struggles to become the leader he knows he has to be.  He forms a charming partnership with Boyega’s Finn, with the friends working to build an army to launch one last offensive against The First Order. Ridley is given the most screen time, which is a good thing given the seismic shifts in character she has to perform. She navigates these sharp turns well, steering Rey towards a plausible – if unsatisfying – conclusion. Adam Driver may be the actor whose stock has most risen since the films began, but a role this slight would leave even the most talented stars stranded. Ben/Kylo’s conflicted stance means he’s lost in the shuffle. He’s not the hero of the story, but nor is he the villain. His arc has potential, but with the focus elsewhere, he often feels like a character from an entirely different film. He’s someone for Ridley to spar with, to run to and from. Aside from one waterside heart-to-heart, his journey is mainly to service his co-star. Of all the under-developed characters in this trilogy, he’s the most wasted. As for the old guard, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) returns for little reason other than he’s the last original character who hadn’t already reappeared. Like the film in microcosm, his appearance is fun but pointless. It’s also time to say goodbye to the late Carrie Fisher, of course, with the production working-in previously cut footage to round out her performance. It isn’t seamless, but it’s at least respectful. The Rise of Skywalker is a film designed to calm the waters, but is that what Star Wars really needed? It’s true that The Last Jedi took some narrative risks that didn’t pay off, but a follow up that plays it safe from beginning to end hardly seems preferable. What should feel like an epic conclusion to a 42-year-old story instead acts as proof that the franchise that has lost its way.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," Forty-two years ago, we were first taken to a galaxy far, far away, and film as we know it changed forever. Star Wars not only produced a groundbreaking new way of filmmaking but created a fan base that is as divisive as it possibly could be. It’s one of the most passionate fan bases I know. While quite vocal over the past four years during the releases of The Force Awakens and 2017’s controversial, The Last Jedi, there is no denying that fans across the galaxy were ready for the conclusion of the Skywalker Saga with the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Without question, this film is the most flawed out of the “Disney” trilogy. A film, while full of fan service tidbits and nostalgia, has a difficult time distancing itself from that crutch to establish itself fully throughout its early run time.  I believe that Star Wars: The Last Jedi is a real original look at what Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker could have been with unique storytelling.  Rather than focus solely on the Skywalker name, The Last Jedi establishes that you don’t need Skywalker blood to become a Jedi, as the prequels and former Star Wars stories showed us with characters such as Mace Windu, Qui-Gon, and of course, Obi-Wan. Many fans rejected that concept, and that coincides with Rise of Skywalker’s most significant issue – it spends the first 45 minutes of the film “cleaning up” the choices made in the previous movie rather than pushing forward the last film’s different perspective.  When the exposition in the beginning finally finishes, this is where Rise of Skywalker really picks up steam. J.J. Abrams never fails to deliver a polished, entertaining film that includes all the elements of Star Wars that have brought fans together over the past four decades. The film is a relentless thrill ride with some of the best set pieces In the entire Disney trilogy. While the lesser of the three films, Rise of Skywalker, comes the closest in matching the original trilogy in terms of humor, heart, and showcasing a team dynamic that was missing from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.  Now, there are questions I can answer without spoiling. Carrie Fisher is used beautifully throughout the film and, quite frankly, a more significant focal point to the central story than I originally expected. It is well known that Episode IX was set to be Leia’s story, and J.J. does a great job of incorporating and elevating Leia and Carrie’s importance to not only the franchise but for a legion of Star Wars fans. Leia will forever be my princess. Let’s discuss Emperor Palpatine. Ian McDiarmid has not lost a step. His return to the throne does not fail as he is as menacing and fear-inducing as before. However, a huge flaw was the explanation or lack thereof on how he was able to return. Was he always set to be the Big Bad of this trilogy, or was this course correction after The Last Jedi? We’ll never know, but we can enjoy his time onscreen.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are the MVPs of Rise of Skywalker. Both give their all in their final performances as Rey and Ben Solo. From the moment I laid eyes on Rey in The Force Awakens, I’ve felt that she was the perfect heroine to lead this new trilogy, and she does not disappoint, and Rey’s story pleasingly comes full circle. While there are lesser fans of Ben, with criticism ranging from, “He should be working at Hot Topic with his temper tantrums,” to “He’s just always whining,” I’ve personally been a fan of his story and especially now with its conclusion in this film. My counter to those previous criticisms has always been, “He’s a Skywalker. Would you expect nothing less?” Ben’s obsession with becoming his grandfather was his motivation, and once he became Supreme Leader, as seen in this film, his attitude changes. He becomes more assertive and in control, adding more depth to his character, unlike seen before. His story was one of the best endings I’ve seen in the franchise.  As always, the supporting players add a ton to the film. Finn, while I’ve never been a fan of, feels essential to the central story here, especially in the battle against the First Order. Poe channels his inner Han Solo, and Finn and Poe’s buddy chemistry is admirable. The return of Lando was a sweet treat for fans, and while not a massive player to the film’s overall narrative, his appearance is welcomed along with Chewie and all our favorite droids. They all shine bright in this film.  In his final work in the Star Wars franchise, John Williams delivers a pleasing and impactful score. A score that with each beat calls back to every film in the franchise and molds them into one of his best works throughout the entire saga. Star Wars is and will continue to be more than just a film franchise to me. There are decades of memories, good times, and bad times that this space soap opera have been a part of, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. As the saga comes to an end, Rise of Skywalker, while flawed in some areas, has successfully ended the story of the Skywalker family in a gratifying fashion. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 12, 2022"," There has never been a review that has caused more nerves while preparing to write it than this one. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not only concludes the new trilogy of Star Wars films, but wraps up a saga started over 40 years ago. There is no doubting that Star Wars has become a foundation in our pop culture that will live on forever. Especially after The Last Jedi though, where director Rian Johnson pushed the series into a totally different style. Star Wars also has become one of the most decisive franchises out there, with those – shall we say – differing opinions with each new installment. Already days before the official release of The Rise of Skywalker, these sides have been at war with each other without even seeing the movie. Different opinions are fine, despite what Twitter seems to make everyone think, as cinema speaks to us in different ways. There is not a single other movie that comes to mind with the scale and controversy from its fanbase than The Rise of Skywalker. It is impossible to look at this film outside of the context of which it was built. As mentioned before, 2017’s The Last Jedi pushed Star Wars into unknown territory, sticking out against every other piece of media in the franchise for better or for worse. Almost becoming a meditation on good vs. evil and the muddy area between, the movie polarized audiences. With Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) growing stronger than ever, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) pushing her training as much as she can, the conflict between Jedi and Sith finally reaches a climax in a battle for the universe. At the beginning of The Rise of Skywalker it is clear that the people behind the scenes reacted to the direction Rian Johnson had taken the franchise. Almost immediately the film retcons so much that The Last Jedi spent its entire runtime trying to build. From mysteries surrounding our main characters, to Kylo Ren being a neutral force trying to destroy both the good and bad. The Rise of Skywalker starts by destroying a good amount of what was already built in order to set it’s own story up. At first, this appears legitimately infuriating. Specifically with stripping down the character of Kylo Ren (a character I found extremely interesting in The Last Jedi) of his nuance as a villain and reducing him back down to just being a bad guy on the side of the Sith. Rian Johnson had set The Rise of Skywalker up to be different and something incredibly unique compared to the rest of the franchise. Initially, it seemed that J.J. Abrams was just trying to play it safe that perhaps did nothing new from the other films. This was also heavily felt at the beginning of the film, with the character of Rey. They set her character up as a Jedi dealing with her anger, pulling her towards the Darkside. This is a character arc we have seen multiple times in this franchise up to this point, and made the character just seem mundane at first. This is clearly where most are stopping with their opinions of the film condemning the rest as bland garbage. From this point of destruction on though what The Rise of Skywalker builds from it’s initial destruction was not only just pure enjoyment, but was deep and intriguing, pushing the story and the world in its own subtle and unique ways. It is hard to talk about the morals and messages this film is trying to explore without getting into spoilers. This is a huge film that explores themes of purpose and destiny in ways that have never really been seen before in the franchise. The battle between the Jedi and the Sith has always been one that never quite seemed to connect with me in the way that it has for others. The moral idea that one side is objectively good and one side is objectively bad never gained much traction from me. But the idea that you are born on a side and even if you are born on the wrong side you eventually find your way to the other, never quite worked for me. My favorite part of The Last Jedi was its exploration of this good vs. evil in the form of Kylo Ren. And where nothing in this film quite reaches that point of intrigue, it does continue to push this idea in a way that was thoroughly engaging. The moral takeaway from The Rise of Skywalker and it’s exploration of this is also possibly the most relevant moral a Star Wars movie has ever had. This movie has important ideas and lessons that need to be taught, and this movie accomplishes that. This is not just a fun sci-fi movie, it is smart and has something important to say. The way The Rise of Skywalker also explores the past and it’s effect on the current and future also ties this new trilogy nicely together on a thematic level. From Kylo Ren first drawing inspiration from the past, eventually wanting to kill it, to Rey still being haunted by her past, having been abandoned by her parents. This movie reaches a conclusion with this idea it’s been exploring since The Force Awakens, that feels satisfying and gives it an even bigger reason to exist. Providing something that none of the other six main movies could, a look at the consequences from the past shown in those films and how that helps and hurts characters throughout these films. This is a level of perspective series rarely gets to have following a journey through three generations. With that said though, the film absolutely is tons of fun, featuring some of the best comedy from the entire franchise. I have not laughed so hard at C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) as he nearly steals the show. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) also really shines here, after having missed most of The Force Awakens and being brought down by easily the most painful part of The Last Jedi. Poe finally is able to take more of a lead role, showing off not just Oscar Issac’s extreme charisma, but also his emotional ability as an actor. If he was given the right plot in these films, Poe really could have been the new Han Solo. Sadly, up until this film he was not given the opportunity to become much more than a fun side character. If you have seen the other Star Wars movies and at least have enjoyed some of them, or simply grew up with them, this movie will at least also work with you on a basic level. There is something chilling about hearing the swell of music at the beginning of the films, as the logo appears, and the opening crawl starts to reveal itself. One huge complaint that keeps floating around is the fan service in The Rise of Skywalker. Many have called this lazy, but I have to disagree. Not only do these callbacks help bring this movie full circle, but there is something very effective about seeing these classic characters back on screen. Neither do these moments of fan service become so significant to the plot that it feels like it takes away from story values. The action in this film is also breathtaking. In the opening introduction to the film there is a spectacular chase scene – legitimately one of my favorites now of the Star Wars series. Every piece of action is pulsating and thrilling. Not only because of the incredible visual effects, but also the fine cinematography from Dan Mindel. Unique and impressive throughout, the handheld approach to some of these tracking shots in the action also give this movie a dynamic edge. The weight of the conflict in this film also added something to the story – particularly on an emotional level. Perhaps more than ever this is a fight for the universe. There is no option for the Jedi to lose and live to fight another day, adding a sense of desperation that put the gravitas on every decision our heroes made. On another positive, judging by certain elements the trailers teased, I was nervous about some of the twists and turns potentially in store. However, the narrative of this saga and the practicality of the film, each reveal works beyond what may or may not be false alarms. No spoilers here, there’ll be. On the flip side, the story itself seems to try and juggle a lot. The film sets up three clear stories to follow, and as it attempts to reset itself to a point from The Last Jedi – while carrying some baggage from it – The Rise of Skywalker is somewhat jumbled in places. Some plot points were fabricated to follow proceedings, like randomly finding important information in unlikely places. Although not completely meaningless, compared to the other Star Wars movies – like the Jabba the Hunt fight from Return of the Jedi for example – the fillers in this movie felt smaller and did build to service it’s narrative and moral messages. With The Rise of Skywalker‘s inclusion of General Leia (Carrie Fisher), utilizing archival footage of her, is smartly used quite sparingly. Even if the placement was a little off (you could tell she wasn’t really in the conversations), it made for a compelling respect to both the character and late actor. Somehow, despite being traditionally on the more critical side of Star Wars, judging by early social media reactions, The Rise of Skywalker is way higher on my Star Wars ranked list than most. Structurally, this movie is one of the soundest in this entire franchise. Especially once you get past the rocky start. The Rise of Skywalker might play it safer than its predecessor, The Last Jedi, but it so effective in its messages that it connects and provides a more a very satisfying conclusion. Not just to this trilogy, but the Skywalker saga overall. The Rise of Skywalker gives you chills, is an absolute blast overall, and I, personally, am already planning my next trip through the galaxy with it.",POSITIVE
"Oct 20, 2021"," Well, it’s finally over. After 42 years, the Skywalker saga has (allegedly) ended with THE RISE OF SKYWALKER and I am sad, yet totally here for it. You don’t need me to tell you how culturally significant the STAR WARS franchise has been. I have been a diehard fangirl since I first saw Princess Leia’s iconic buns and blaster, Han’s handsome smirk, and Luke’s luminescent lightsaber. With such history, I can only imagine the difficulty in deciding how to say goodbye to this beloved series and its old and new characters, but director JJ Abrams (who directed my favorite STAR WARS film THE FORCE AWAKENS) nailed it.  Of course, you’re never going to make everyone happy and as you may or may not have seen, the film has become very divisive with fans. I will admit that there are a few things I wish Abrams had done differently, mainly when it came to honoring the characters of Rose and Finn. However, I genuinely find it hard to imagine calling this movie “bad” or considering it a disappointment.  So, with all of the ridiculous hostility surrounding THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, I wanted to focus on the several things I loved most about the film. Hopefully, instead of focusing on the negativity, you will buy a ticket and make your own decision. Will this be your favorite film in the franchise? Probably not. THE FORCE AWAKENS and EMPIRE STRIKES BACK exist. But embrace your inner fanboy/fangirl and have fun. How can you not? It’s STAR WARS, you scruffy-looking nerfherder!  The stakes. Because Han F-ing Solo was killed in THE FORCE AWAKENS, and Luke Skywalker, Supreme Leader Snoke, and Admiral Holdo (Laura Dern) died in THE LAST JEDI, I was constantly concerned that another big character was going to go kaput in this film, especially with it being the last in the franchise. And that’s how an action movie should be! I won’t tell you if anyone *does* die, but the fact that STAR WARS has shown it is possible really added to the suspense of each fight.  The music. Do I even need to mention this? John Williams’ score continues to not only be a main highlight for each film but also a main character itself. RISE OF SKYWALKER is no exception. How he is able to build and release tension through his score in each scene is unmatched in cinema. I love how each character has his or her own theme. Unsurprisingly, Leia’s theme really got to me… especially when we see Carrie Fisher on screen as Leia for the last time.  And don’t get me started on Keri Russell, who stars as an awesome new masked character named Zorii Bliss. Although Zorii may only show her eyes, Russell gives an incredibly expressive performance, rocks a sleek costume, and her chemistry with Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is white-hot. I am going to need a spin-off movie or TV show ASAP.  The cute new characters. I would die for BB-8 and leave it to STAR WARS to introduce us to a couple more new characters this time around ( no unfortunately one of those is not baby Yoda). Babu Frik is too cute for me to handle, even if his particular set of skills may be detrimental to a fan favorite character. LOOK AT HIS LITTLE WELDING MASK! My heart! And this sounds a bit weird to say, but I love the friendship between the new Pixar lamp-looking droid called D-O and BB-8 almost as much as I loved hearing the droid tell Rey “no thank you” when she attempts to touch him… similar to what I want to say to all of the RISE OF SKYWALKER haters!

"Sep 8, 2021"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the final entry in the series’ nine-film Skywalker story, is the cinematic equivalent of Anakin and Obi-Wan landing that gigantic ship at the end of Revenge of the Sith’s opening space battle. It’s not exactly clean or elegant, and the entire ship is on fire with bells and whistles going off when it lands. But it’s a thrill to watch, and it’s all smiles and relieved laughter once everyone is back on solid ground.  Despite some bumps, director J.J. Abrams & Co. bring the saga home in one piece. It’s a whimsical, aggressively engaging, positively exhausting movie that all at once might fry your brain and make you fall in love again with one of our defining cultural touchstones.  Early buzz after the film’s L.A. premiere was that some found its reported galaxy-brain plotting and nostalgic pandering wearying. Indeed, Abrams leans into all of his vices with his return to the series — trapdoor twists, dorky MacGuffin quests, imprecise dialogue — as well as his virtues, including strong characters, good casting and high-energy chase scenes. These movies are about kooky, melodramatic space adventures that lean on the wholesome values of friendship and hope — that’s exactly what The Rise of Skywalker hangs its cloak on and why it works so well. Though with the previous Star Wars saga installment, The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson made a film that loved its universe and characters, the director caught flack for challenging the series to look past its patented palace intrigue and familial melodrama into galaxies of new possibility. Abrams seems to have allowed some of that to rub off, though he certainly also comes to this armed with all the Force Awakens’ loose plot threads, Bad Robot mystery-box surprises and fan service.  Abrams is a devotee of the establishment, not a disruptor like Johnson. But he also seems to have a distinct bone to pick with the boneheads who rallied against The Last Jedi for malevolent reasons. Abrams indeed has the final word here, but he offers a loving advancement to Johnson’s noble call to expand the galaxy’s heroes to include more than just those holding a lightsaber. Abrams is more interested in the people and places we already know, but he fits in what he wants from Johnson's film more generously than you might expect. The unification is not perfect, but it feels right.  Maybe you’ll disagree. Some will likely find The Rise of Skywalker a garish nostalgia run with silly developments. After all, this is Star Wars. Post-film discussion and debate are as much a part of the films as the stories themselves. The Rise of Skywalker differs from The Last Jedi in some ways, but both glow with a love and admiration for the message of the original trilogy. All that’s left at the end is a landed ship, and a reminder of how powerful these movies can be to the ones who they matter to the most. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 19, 2021"," A disjointed, rushed, and incohesive mess of fan service and B genre plotting. Kennedy should have the reins taken away from her now that this body is bagged and tagged. Lucas not finishing his Saga as a holistic storyteller was already deeply disappointing to me and this just rubs salt in the wound.  Boyega, Ridley, and Isaac are bad in this film. I genuinely like each person and at least one of their performances in another film. The action choreography is perhaps the worst I’ve seen on a project at this scale and budget. However there were certainly some positives: Keri Russell’s world and character were neat, I dug Babu Frik, that opening sequence with Driver getting all murdery, and finally engaging with some of the vast body of Sith lore. All in all, I’m disappointed and wonder what the hell specifically lead to this fan service centric trilogy that has nothing new or interesting to say. At least to me.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 12, 2021"," It may not have been in a galaxy far, far away but it does feel like a long time ago that the Star Wars saga began with George Lucas’s 1977 space opera: “Star Wars IV: A New Hope.” Now, the whole story comes full circle with “Star Wars IX: The Rise of Skywalker.” I’m hoping, however, that the phenomenon that is Star Wars is not coming to an end. Like “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story” showed, there are other tales to tell about the Rebellion’s fight to overcome evil in the galaxy. And this particular Star Wars fan will be on hand to see them whenever they come around. The final installment in the Star Wars saga, “The Rise of Skywalker,” is a fitting end to more than four decades of storytelling. It has everything fans love. J.J. Abrams is back behind the helm as director and co-writer after Rian Johnson’s much-debated Episode VIII, “The Last Jedi.” Filled with epic battle sequences, old friends, new friends, and old enemies, “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t meet the memorability of “The Empire Strikes Back,” but it does leave the audience with hope and a rather shocking answer to a burning question left over from Episodes VII and VIII, namely, what are Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) origins? Hopefully, the answer will surprise you as it did me. After the now-familiar, but, oh, so exciting, opening scroll, we find the rebels, always outnumbered and short on time, gathering resources to challenge the First Order and new Supreme Leader, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) are out seeking information and allies to join in the fight. Back at base, Rey hones her Jedi skills under the watchful eye of General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher from archival footage). But there’s still something unsettled about Rey that Ridley’s performance manages to convey to the audience so much so that we can feel her ambiguity and ache with her as she struggles to discover who she is and what her ultimate purpose will be. Her Force-enhanced connection with Kylo Ren only confuses matters more for her. His invitation to join him leads her to set aside her training, much like Luke did in “The Empire Strikes Back.” Rey seems to know that within Kylo Ren, still lives Ben Solo, son of Han (Harrison Ford) and Leia, and she wants to bring him back to the light, especially for Leia’s sake. And speaking of Leia, the way she’s woven into the story after Carrie Fisher’s death in 2016 using archival footage from “The Force Awakens” is seamless and doesn’t feel contrived like the digital inclusion of her younger self in earlier films. Kudos go to Abrams and co-writer, Chris Terrio, for making Fisher’s beloved Leia an integral part of this last Star Wars film. There have always been spiritual undertones in all the Star Wars films, and “Rise of Skywalker” is no different. While the idea of the Force being an energy that connects all living things still smacks of New Age thought, we Christians know that it’s really God who is the all-powerful force in the universe and all created reality. Very strong in this film is the reality of self-sacrifice and redemption. Strong also is the hope that comes from knowing we’re not alone, so relevant in our society today. I don’t know about you, but there have been times in my life when I felt like I was the only one experiencing some sort of suffering or uncertainty. Fear or pain often does that to us. Whatever is going on in our lives, we can convince ourselves that no one else could possibly understand what we’re going through. Loneliness and isolation follow. In her training, we hear Rey petitioning: “Be with me.” Being the last of the Jedi, it is natural that Rey would have felt alone and thought that no one could understand her suffering. So she prays, “be with me.” She pulls on the strength of the Jedi before her, especially Luke. Even in her darkest hour, she knows that she’s not alone in her struggle. Knowing that we, also, are not alone can be lifesaving. No matter how alone we may feel, God is always with us. We are still in the midst of the Christmas Season, a time when we celebrate Jesus, the second person of the Trinity, coming to us as a vulnerable child to show us how much God wants to be with us. God never leaves us alone. It’s not clear to whom Rey addresses her “be with me,” but for us, we address that prayer to God, who responds to us: “I am with you always” (Matthew 28:20). In this assurance lies our hope. Sister Hosea Rupprecht is a member of the Daughters of St. Paul, a religious community dedicated to evangelization with the media.

"Jun 26, 2021","Abrams knows when and how to play the nostalgia card without getting intoxicated with it, allowing us to say goodbye to the heroes of the original saga, but without removing the focus from the real protagonists of this story [Full review in Spanish]",NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2021","  For more than 40 years, the specter of Star Wars has hung over the movie landscape like no other franchise. It has influenced countless filmmakers, showing up in big and small ways in multiple other works of art. Now, characters new and old are getting one last chance to add to the series' legacy with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.  Without getting into spoiler specifics, the Resistance — led by Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suatamo), and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) — are still facing the threat of the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But a new danger has emerged, one that divides the focus of the Resistance and may also usurp the power of the First Order.  The previous film, The Last Jedi, was a divisive effort because of new elements that writer/director Rian Johnson introduced to the series. J.J. Abrams, who directed and co-wrote The Force Awakens, is back for Episode XI, and he brings with him both the familiar and unfamiliar.  There are plenty of recognizable settings and characters from previous movies to trigger nostalgia, but enough is different so as to not seem simply like a retread of things that have been done before. He also introduces some heretofore unseen elements that may have some purists crying foul.  That said, a lot of retconning is done to make sure plot points that were introduced in the previous two films fall into place. Some of them feel organic to an ever-evolving plot, but there are more than a few that come off as shoehorned in, putting a round peg in a square hole just to provide some sort of answer.  Unfortunately, one of the biggest of these is the presence of Leia in the film. Abrams and his team used footage from Fisher's work on The Force Awakens to make her a part of the plot, and a series of perfunctory lines fail to do justice for either the character or the actor, who died in 2016. Because of Leia's relationships with other characters, emotions do come, but they don't feel fully earned.  The connection between Rey and Kylo Ren was the overarching part of the first two films, and that bond comes to a head in The Rise of Skywalker. Abrams and Johnson have tried to make this relationship on par with that of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, but it's never had that depth of feeling. Still, they do engage in some epic battles, and the way their story is wrapped up is fully satisfying.  Poe and Finn are crucial to the plot of the film, but neither feels as important as Rey. They spend most of their time ensconced with the rest of the Resistance, and their efforts are more part of the team than as individuals. They do get some fun and exciting moments, but nothing that makes them truly stand out.  Part of the reason for this is because the new characters in this trilogy have never been able to move out of the shadow of the characters from the first trilogy. The old characters are revered or reviled by the new characters for good reason, but the attention paid to them has prevented these new films from ever being able to establish their own identity. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a finale that is both enthralling and frustrating, feelings that could change in either direction on repeat viewings. One can only hope that, now that the Skywalker saga is finished, future Star Wars films can explore whatever direction they please without being as beholden to the legacy that came before. 1.

"Feb 16, 2021"," If you were looking for the perfect film to put a capstone on the 2010’s, Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker arguably would be it. Even with the blockbuster heavyweight of Avengers: Endgame concluding the first ten years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, TROS—as we’ll call it for ease—was the most anticipated cinematic event of the year, given it doesn’t just serve as the third part of a trilogy but also the concluding chapter of a nine-part, four decade spanning saga within easily the biggest film franchise in movie history. This is about as epic as franchise filmmaking gets. Though Star Wars, the jewel in Disney’s all-dominating media crown, will of course continue into the 2020’s, this marks the end of the Skywalker Saga with which George Lucas changed the landscape of movie-making more than perhaps any director in the 20th century. The final conclusion to a story we thought had definitively ended twice before. Going into The Rise of Skywalker, you may experience cautious optimism. Rian Johnson delivered a defiantly auteur-driven, insular examination of the core mystical and philosophical themes within Star Wars with 2017’s trilogy middle-part The Last Jedi, going in brave new directions from 2015’s vibrant trilogy opener The Force Awakens, in which JJ Abrams revived the franchise with a verve that spoke to Lucas’ original, Saturday adventure serial vision. With Abrams back at the helm, following the departure of original director Colin Trevorrow, there was every reason to believe TROS would recapture TFA’s spirit and top off Star Wars with a fulsome flourish. You may leave The Rise of Skywalker somewhat perplexed that that didn’t happen. That, in fact, Abrams has delivered the weakest Star Wars film since, quite possibly, fetid prequel Attack of the Clones. For a myriad amount of reasons, The Rise of Skywalker feels like an argument, on screen, for why going into the next decade we need to rethink how we approach franchise filmmaking. It doesn’t just feel like a culmination of indulgent cinematic excess but a cautionary bulwark against it. When it was announced in 2012 that Disney had purchased LucasFilm and a new Star Wars trilogy was being developed, a million voices cried out not in terror but rather jubilation, even after the underwhelming prequels. The idea we would see Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo and the classic trilogy characters again was thrilling, but it tapped into a powerful emotion that has come to define mainstream entertainment this last decade: nostalgia. Nostalgia has always been present in popular culture. You would never have had 1999’s The Phantom Menace and all of the revived Star Wars content after it if not for a yearning to return to the comfort of a universe that defined millions of childhoods in the 1970’s and 1980’s, the period directors like Abrams and writers such as Chris Terrio—drafted it to co-write TROS after Trevorrow’s firing and the junking of much of his script—were growing up. A period in which creators such as Lucas or Steven Spielberg brought escapist entertainment back to the masses as super producers who launched entire empires, from on screen to merchandising to games to… you name it. Properties like Star Wars became cottage industries, about more than just the films themselves, and they swept up children and young adults into the worlds these creatives conjured. It’s why Generation X in particular are largely defined by pop-culture references in the way Baby Boomers often aren’t. It’s also why they keenly feel the pull of nostalgia in their storytelling. In everything from cinematic franchises such as Star Trek or James Bond tapping into their iconic 1960’s roots or popular properties being reborn or sequelized—Ghostbusters, Doctor Sleep—through to classic TV shows being revived with the same legendary characters and actors—The X-Files, the upcoming Star Trek: Picard—through to contemporary masterpieces such as recently Watchmen telling vibrant new stories which revolve around legacy and the past defining us, the 2010’s has seen audiences look in the rear view mirror for comforting, reassuring fodder. Perhaps as a response to the chaotic events in politics and social change that have rippled across the globe particularly in the last half of the decade, audiences have clung to familiarity and narrative safety. Heroes have seen a powerful rebirth in our consciousness, hence why the MCU has become so prosperous or the Arrowverse on television. We have looked to what we know and we have welcomed stories which reinforce our primal, existential hope someone will be there to save us. Star Wars, from its inception, has always been a fairy tale. Lucas built what would become Episode IV: A New Hope on mythical fable tropes, transposing them to the science-fiction genre as he sought to create his own version of the Flash Gordon serials from the 1930’s. It was always a story of pure good vs pure evil, hence the constructs of the Jedi and the Sith, or the Force as an intangible construct that could be bent toward either paradigm. Lucas’ original trilogy was designed as a classic heroes journey, as defined by the groundbreaking work of cultural anthropologist Joseph Campbell, who in his book The Hero With a Thousand Faces pulled together mythic constructs from dozens of historical cultures which shared common archetypes that boiled down to this: the journey of the hero sees them travel from safety into the unknown on a quest, in which they lay their past ghosts to rest with the help of a wizened mentor, defeat the obstacle in their way, and recover a treasure they then take back to their original home. In the process, they are changed and renewed. A journey without is really the journey within. If you look at a significant amount of modern pop culture fiction, and the majority of the stories we are most invested in culturally, they often cleave to heroes journeys. This is something I’ve built my upcoming book, Myth-Building in Modern Media, around – this idea of the ‘Monomytharc’, that contemporary fictional mythologies in popular culture utilise many of these Campbellian structures to define their characters and worlds. It happens in Avengers: Endgame. You can see it in Game of Thrones, which infamously ended this year. It’s present in Star Wars from the very beginning and Luke’s entire story in the original trilogy tracks this mythological arc.  Luke ventures out from Tatooine a naive young farmhand, undertakes a quest to understand his true self with the help of a mentor (Yoda), faces the duality of his lineage pulling him between good and evil after learning Darth Vader is actually his father, and then refuses to allow Emperor Palpatine to corrupt him, enabling Vader’s own redemption as a consequence – which, too, fulfills a similar journey Anakin Skywalker takes in the prequels, only his being the inverse, turning away from good to evil. This duality, this eventual understanding of one’s true self, is key to how Star Wars is approached in every one of it’s eight episodic films. And the message is always this: good will triumph. Evil will be vanquished. The Force (for good) will be with you, always. The Rise of Skywalker is no exception. There are no surprises. There are no diversions. There is the nostalgic fulcrum of a narrative structure you, as an audience expect of this film. That’s also a key point here: expectation. We have become hardwired to expect that triumph, even when we don’t see it reflected in our own lived experience.  If this were reality, given the emergence of fascist demagogues such as Donald Trump or Jair Bolsonaro etc… or the normalisation of right-wing tropes that are encouraging intolerance and violence across the globe, Kylo Ren would undoubtedly have been the one to rise in this story. He and Palpatine would have killed Rey and simply dominated the universe with their Final Order, something they probably could have done with relative ease at multiple points in this trilogy. Yet, as audiences, we expect the Jedi and their quasi-Buddhist philosophy of quiet strength and tolerance to prosper. Much like after Avengers: Infinity War, when Thanos actually did manage to wipe out half of the universe and half of our heroes, the question for Endgame was never: will they defeat him? It was always: how will they defeat him? And how will those lost heroes return? Everyone knew they would. It was satisfying to see occur but it was a given. Thanos may boast he is inevitable but the only inevitability about Endgame was in how it ended. We wouldn’t have expected anything less. It is quite remarkable just how similar the last act of TROS is to the final act of Endgame, actually, having spent the majority of the running time pillaging from half a dozen different famous and beloved pieces of popular culture. It is at various points ‘Indiana Jones and the Rise of Skywalker’ or ‘Harry Potter and the Sith Wayfinder’. The ending, however, is particularly in step with Endgame’s expected denouement of bringing all of our heroes as close to destruction as possible, in the face of impossible, universe-shattering odds, only to have a Gandalf in The Return of the King or Littlefinger in Battle of the Bastards-style last minute turn of the tide which allows Rey and company to succeed. Endgame, without question, did it better, having thoroughly laid the groundwork for the breathtaking moment of spectacle in which the entire MCU shows up to take down Thanos. There is nothing like that in TROS. Even with your expectation that it will happen, the last act is built on an ever-collapsing house of cards in which the rules of the entire story are re-written on the spot to up the stakes again and again and again. It is, among many things in TROS, that doesn’t make a lick of sense. It’s hard for me to admit as an admittedly huge fan of JJ Abrams work for almost 20 years that this was the first time I walked out of one of his projects knowing, in my heart of hearts, that it just wasn’t very good. Star Trek Into Darkness depreciates the more you watch it but even that I emerged from initially delighted (perhaps because I’m a Trekkie as opposed to being more of a casual Wars fan). Emerging from TROS felt a little like coming out of the other side of a chaotic head rush, a confluence of elements which should have made sense but didn’t. Abrams puts together a film which, whether intentionally or not, seems willfully determined to run with abandon in the opposite direction to The Last Jedi in almost every way. The frenetic opening scenes quickly throw back in Palpatine with zero context, quickly explain Snoke, quickly establish the tropes that Abrams relies heavily on in his construction of Star Wars narratives—treasures and quest items—and foregrounds the questions that Rian Johnson intended for audiences to do away with entirely: who is Rey? Why is she special? And what does this mean for the end of the saga? This, too, was an inevitability. One of the key negative reactions from the entitled fanboy base of Star Wars following The Last Jedi was that Johnson’s suggestion that Rey was nobody—despite TFA foreshadowing the contrary—and everyone had the potential to become a Jedi, or indeed a ‘sky walker’, was just virtue signalling, liberal BS. The noisiest fan base did not want to accept that Rey would not conventionally have a destiny, and it’s clearly something Abrams believed too. Abrams and Terrio are fanboys, let’s not forget, in something of a different manner to Johnson; the latter was keen to try and transform Star Wars, to push and challenge at the tropes and perceptions constructed over the previous seven films, keen to use his knowledge of the franchise to subvert those Campbellian structures.  In doing so, Rey and Ren started to feel more like complicated humans filled with a dangerous sexual energy, Finn embraced a journey of tolerance and bonding with Rose Tico (in TROS reduced to little more than an exposition machine) to help an underclass stymied by fascist-enabling capitalist structures, and Poe pushed against conditioned swaggering masculine heroism in the face of powerful female leaders. TROS ejects all of that almost instantly. Rey is now on a conventional Campbellian journey, as is Ren in opposition. Finn ends up caught between plotlines, tethered to Rey in one moment and then elsewhere the next. Poe is simply reverted to a cocksure amalgam of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, saddled with a conventional spiky romance with Keri Russell’s sexy trader Zorri. Leia resorts to awkward platitudes (they really should have not had Carrie Fisher in this because it just looks and sounds uncanny). Even Luke, from beyond, ends up telling Rey “I was wrong”, handing back the lightsaber he threw away. All of The Last Jedi’s nuance is underwritten. This is perhaps because Abrams isn’t that kind of filmmaker. He is almost a love child of Lucas’ stringent fascination with myth and mystery and Spielberg’s imaginative wonder and emotion. Abrams tells stories from the heart whereas Johnson works a little bit more from the head. Abrams understands the heroes journey as a quest narrative, and that’s how he and Lawrence Kasdan wrote The Force Awakens – the quest there was to find Luke, who was the treasure in the cave at the end of the story Rey faced key trials to reach, learning aspects of herself in the process. If TROS has Sith artefacts then TFA had Jedi maps but the essential construct was the same. TFA borrowed heavily from A New Hope in the process but it worked fine because it was, at the same time, rebuilding and reconstructing a world and establishing characters, journeys and mysteries.  If you look at Abrams’ career, how often does he ever end a story? Mission Impossible, Star Trek, Lost, Alias – all are either yet to be ended or were concluded by other people. Endings are far far harder than beginnings. Sticking landings is tough and Abrams was tasked with not just unconventionally for him ending a story he initialised, but also course correcting from The Last Jedi—a film he would have done entirely differently—and creating a grand unified theory of the entire 42 year old Skywalker saga. Like Endgame, the culmination of Star Wars’ first true cycle, not just the end of a trilogy. As a result, Abrams enables the kind of nostalgic safety that The Last Jedi ran away from. This isn’t the same Ren who barked “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to”. This is a Kylo who encourages Rey to embrace her own past, embrace the key connection and truth about her parents—which you’ll probably be able to guess after the first few scenes—and embrace her crucial link to the entirety of the franchise to date. Rey was always important. There was always going to be an ultimate destiny. There would always be an ultimate battle. And consequently, everything is on turbo.  The Millennium Falcon hyper-jumps between systems and landscapes for the ultimate space chase. The First Order unleash the biggest fleet of star destroyers any Star Wars film could possibly deliver. We get call backs galore – characters (Lando Calrissian, Wedge Antilles), entire moments from previous films repurposed (such as the X-Wing rising out the Dagobah swamp), and Force powers that wouldn’t go amiss out of a video game. It teases the deaths of major characters and then almost instantly rolls back on them. Though Abrams is more intelligent than just pandering to fanboys who wish to see very expensive fan fiction on screen, TROS is essentially just that – a nostalgic, re-heated mash up of everything you have loved about Star Wars for four decades charged to maximum. There is however one thing it lacks, aside from much in the way of logic at key points, especially the final act, that TFA and TLJ both had: soul. The Rise of Skywalker left me empty in a similar fashion to The Iron Throne, the final episode of Game of Thrones. Both of them were enjoyable, both were highly anticipated, but both were constructed on narrative expectations of mystery and payoff that audiences had largely predetermined, and seeing them play out as expected left a hollow evaporation. I’ve thought almost nothing about Game of Thrones since that finale when I expected to be turning it over for years. Compare this to Watchmen, a masterful examination of legacy and nostalgia which points out how dangerous those elements can be to the modern day, and we’re legions apart. Similarly, The Rise of Skywalker escapes into the ether the moment it has finished. There is none of the rousing spirit of how A New Hope ended or even the cathartic victory of Return of the Jedi. It ends, in true Campbellian fashion, by returning to the beginning and marking that territory, with the last shot playing on perhaps the most iconic shot in Star Wars. That sums up TROS and, in many ways, the cinematic trend of the 2010’s. The determination to look back rather than boldly push forward. The Rise of Skywalker is, creatively, the weakest Star Wars film since Revenge of the Sith and, possibly even Attack of the Clones. At times frenetic,  bereft of storytelling logic and poorly written, it reduces this sequel trilogy to less a point of renewal and satisfaction but rather a pointlessness. If we had known this was where it was all heading, would we have thought twice as to whether it was a good idea? The billions of dollars in box office receipts would have been worth it for Disney but what does TROS truly add for us as audiences? What does it say about our world today, except that fascists are bad and we should all stand together to stop them? That was a message the original trilogy communicated, if less overtly in terms of gender and cultural equality. The Last Jedi especially suggested that Star Wars was on the cusp of a genuine rise of the masses, that the children of tomorrow born not of a quasi-mythical, mystical lineage like Ben Solo or now Rey Palpatine would all become sky walkers, could all harness the Force in order to balance the dyad of good and evil in humanity. For a while, we hoped perhaps that’s what The Rise of Skywalker meant as a title. In the end, it means exactly what you expected it to mean. And that’s both the most inevitable and disappointing way for the Star Wars saga to, for now, come to a close.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 30, 2021"," 
	It has taken 42 years, but the story of the Resistance that started in “Star Wars: A New Hope” comes to its conclusion in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” With an amped-up story, featuring flying Stormtroopers and much talk of destiny, confronting fear and inner turmoil, the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith promises to deliver big at the box office, but will it satisfy old school fans who have waited a lifetime for the film’s final showdown? 
	The events of “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” and the passing of Carrie Fisher presented challenges that helped shape the plot of the new film, but you’ll get no spoilers here. I will say that old footage of Fisher as General Leia Organa from “The Force Awakens” appears alongside new work from Darth Vader's grandson, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Jedi apprentice Rey (Daisy Ridley), Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance-fighter Finn (John Boyega), Resistance pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the First Order's General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). 
	Add to that new characters like diabolical First Order Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), Spice Runners of Kijimi leader Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and returning faves Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker (in what form I will not say) and you have a blended “Brady Bunch-style” family in space. 
	Tasked with wrapping the Skywalker saga up in a pretty bow, director J.J. Abrams has made a film that is part fan service—many familiar faces come along for the ride—and part homage to the Original Trilogy. He replaces subtext with action, rehabilitates one character’s tarnished, cranky old man reputation (NO SPOILERS HERE) and essentially delivers the movie you expect. 
	Abrams knows there are no do overs on this one. “Do or do not; there is no try,” comes to mind. It is the wrap to one of the most popular and talked about film franchises of all time. Expectations are high with the possibility of fan backlash ever present. Questions are answered—Rey’s parentage chief among them—quips are thrown, Chewbacca howls and star ships are blasted to Kingdom Come as “The Rise of Skywalker,” for better and for worse, replaces the nuanced take of Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” with the more tried and true Star Wars tale of nature vs nurture and good vs evil. 
	Jam packed with action and plot, “The Rise of Skywalker” gets bogged down with exposition and tying up loose ends. Worse, it often drifts from the thing that made “Star Wars” great in the first place—the characters. They’re all present and accounted for but are often overshadowed by the whiz bang pacing and over-abundance of story. 
	Having said that, the film’s final third, the payoff to the saga, hits several emotional high points. It’s the end of the saga and, therefore (NO SPOILERS HERE JUST THE FACTS) the final appearances of several members of the original cast. Their exits are handled with sensitivity and should generate a sniffle or two from hard-core fans. 
	The core of the movie is the anguished dynamic between Rey and Kylo. The push and pull between their logical vs biological family commitments is the most compelling part of the story. It also provides for several of the film’s most visually interesting scenes, including a climatic lightsaber battle on the wreckage of the Death Star. 
	“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” ticks a lot of boxes for fans but—again, no spoilers—the mythic battle of good vs evil, of finding balance in the Force, that has fuelled the franchise for 40 plus years, was really only going to resolve itself in one way. As such, the metaphysical struggle is about the journey and not as much about the actual conclusion. 
	Opening in London’s West End in 1981, it ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances. It has played in over 30 countries in 15 languages and has been seen by more than 73 million people worldwide. The showstopping hit song ""Memory"" has been recorded by everyone from Liberace to Barbra Streisand. It is truly a show that always lands on its feet. 
	when he asked the composer if “Cats” was a political metaphor. “Are those cats Queen Victoria, Gladstone and Disraeli?"" the Broadway legend wondered. “Hal,” the composer replied, “this is just about cats.” 
	Let’s not pussyfoot around. “Cats” will go down in history as the weirdest studio movie of 2019. With actors who appear to have been put through the full-body Snapchat cat filter, a Ziegfeld Follies-style chorus line of dancing cockroaches and felines with human hands and feet, you’ll wonder if the theatre popcorn is laced with catnip. 
	It’s an example of spectacle over substance. The songs are catchy, the cats swing and sway in a manner that would make Cirque du Soleil envious, but the story, such that it is, is still simply a collection of show tunes bound by theme but unconcerned with the niceties of plotting. In other words, instead of a story, “Cats” is essentially a cluster of songs of introduction based on a weird, plotless collection of Eliot's poems. 
	Where director Tom Hooper’s “Les Misérables” worked to downplay the musical’s theatricality, “Cats” embraces it, allowing the felines to slink about the set, part ballet, part pantomime, part cat in heart. It’s big and silly, but unfortunately the high-tech veneer of the CGI costumes and sets erases much of the charm present in the more modest stage versions. One of the movie’s highlights is one stripped of (almost) all artifice. Dame Judy stares down the camera to deliver a playful, ""The Ad-dressing of Cats,"" which has the kind of simple, absurd fun the rest of the film lacks. 
	There are other not-so-bad moments. Laurie Davidson’s ""The Magical Mr. Mistoffelees"" has a touch of, well, magic and Taylor Swift sashays convincingly through Bombalurina’s number but while the cast works hard to sell the material, the film is so unrestrained, so in search of meaning in a story that offers up religious resurrection metaphors but not much else, that I suspect audiences will make the Jellicle choice and go see “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” instead. 
	“Bombshell,” the new film starring Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman and a cast of thousands, is set at a time when dinosaurs roamed the earth. The dinosaur in the room in this story is Roger Ailes (John Lithgow), the chairman and CEO of Fox News. Much of the action is set in 2016 but the attitudes on display are positively prehistoric. 
	Ailes died on May 18, 2017, aged 77, but when we first meet him, he reigns supreme. He helped elected presidents, walked the halls of power with confidence and, most importantly for the purposes of this story, created the conservative cable news juggernaut Fox News. Specializing in covering stories that, according to producer Jess Carr (Kate McKinnon), “will scare your grandmother and piss off your grandfather,” Fox became Ailes’ mouthpiece to counter “liberal” CNN. 
	Ailes altered how Americans consumed the news, making stars out of Greta Van Susteren, Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and the two women at the heart of “Bombshell's” story, Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) and Megyn Kelly (Charlize Theron). Kelly is one of the network’s biggest stars, an outspoken lawyer engaged in a war of words with then candidate Donald Trump. The feud was good for ratings, so despite his pro-Trump stance, Ailes allowed it to continue. Not as good for the ratings was Carlson, a former prime-time anchor demoted to midafternoons following disagreements with her boss. 
	Eventually fired, Carlson leveled accusations of sexual misconduct against her former boss, alleging she had been fired for rebuffing Ailes' advances. When the expected support from other women inside Fox who had been auditioned by Ailes with the words, “stand up and give me a twirl,” or “lift your skirt up higher so I can see your legs,” Carlson fears her allegations will fall on deaf ears. 
	On the inside, Kelly weighs her options. Despite a “Support Roger” campaign from colleague Jeanine Pirro (Alanna Ubach), she bides her time before opening up about her own experiences. 
	The title “Bombshell” is a double entendre, referring to Ailes’ objectification of his on-air talent and to the accusations leveled against him, which sent ripples throughout the male dominated corporate world of news. 
	“Bombshell” echoes the story recently told in the mini-series “The Loudest Voice.” Both tell of a toxic workplace where one man ruled by intimidation, sexual harassment and micromanagement. “We have two, three and four doughnut days,” says Ailes’ executive assistant (Holland Taylor). “These aren’t doughnuts he eats. They’re doughnuts he throws.” His, “if you want to play with the big boys you have to lay with the big boys,” credo is dramatized in his interactions with Kayla Pospisil, a composite of several Fox employees, played by Margot Robbie. It was the days before #MeToo and the film does a good job of showing the apprehension some of the abused women feel about revealing their lurid treatment by Ailes. 
	At the film’s helm is Theron, with the aid of an incredible makeup job, disappears into the role of Megyn. She pierces the icy demeanor of Kelly’s on-air persona to reveal a heroine torn between loyalty to a man she knows has done terrible things and doing the right thing. It’s tremendous work that humanizes a character often portrayed in the real-life press as a divisive figure. 
	“Bombshell” is a torn-from-the-headlines story about the people behind the headlines that serves as a reminder of the importance of the #MeToo movement in shining a light on the kind of inappropriate behavior that placed women in peril in the workplace. Good performances, aided by makeup and prosthetics, bring the story to vivid life.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 29, 2021"," “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to. It is the only way to become what you were meant to be.” In 2017, Rian Johnson’s divisive The Last Jedi - with all of its charms and faults - set its eyes on recontextualizing the Star Wars mythos. Daring to scry a future free from tradition and legacy, Jedi and Sith, Skywalkers and Palpatines, the middle entry of the new sequel trilogy boldly jettisoned the status quo. But where The Last Jedi shed the trappings of old, detonating mythologies in service of an exciting and uncertain future, The Rise of Skywalker reaches back with a nostalgic vice-grip, unable to let go of the past in the most frustrating of ways. A weightless and rushed end-cap all too eager to check boxes rather than provide any semblance of real catharsis or closure, the final installment of a saga over forty years in the making lands with a whimper and a shrug.  Of The Last Jedi’s many - and oftentimes controversial - contributions to the Star Wars narrative, none are more resonant than the parallel arcs of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley). Introduced in 2015’s The Force Awakens, Kylo Ren was established as a conflicted dark-sider drawn to the light, while Rey was a mysterious new heroine grappling with her place in the galaxy. With The Last Jedi, writer and director Rian Johnson deepened their stories by exploring the concept of legacy, setting up Kylo Ren and Rey as opposite sides of the same coin. It’s one of Star Wars’ most compelling threads: a corrupted Ben Solo, torn asunder and crushed under the weight of the Skywalker, Vader, and Solo mantles, comes into conflict with Rey, a Force-user untethered from the franchise’s deeply entrenched bloodlines - “a nobody.” In a fateful encounter, Kylo spits venomous truth about Rey’s parents to her face: “They were filthy junk traders. Sold you off for drinking money. They're dead in a pauper's grave in the Jakku desert. You come from nothing. You're nothing. But not to me.” Even the material surrounding The Last Jedi’s release, barely a year old, supported Johnson’s bold democratization of the Force; the book Women of the Galaxy summarizes Rey: “Just because you come from nothing doesn’t mean you’re not part of the story. You’re not no one, because anybody can save the galaxy. Anyone.” Even leading up to the release of The Rise of Skywalker, the water seemed troubled. In the onslaught of press that coincided with the film’s premiere, many of the actors and creators started taking what could only be construed as thinly-veiled potshots at the The Last Jedi. J.J. Abrams, in a widely quoted statement, took his swing: “It’s a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don’t think that people go to Star Wars to be told, ‘This doesn’t matter.’” Furthermore, John Boyega took umbrage at the fact that the cast was separated for much of the last film, while Daisy Ridley “cried” with relief when it was announced that Abrams would be returning to close out the saga. All of this, coupled with the fact that there is a small but incredibly vocal contingent of the fanbase that hates everything about The Last Jedi - from its perceived sidelining of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), to its inclusion of a woman of color, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) - the onus was on Abrams to close out the sequel trilogy in the most satisfactory way.  Unfortunately, in this case, satisfactory also equates to prohibitively safe. The Rise of Skywalker sacks all of The Last Jedi’s narrative boldness and characterization in favor of crowd-pleasing fan service - walking back the most compelling aspects of Rian Johnson’s entry, the film is suffocatingly beholden to nostalgia and Star Wars history. And while it’s one thing to tell a vapid story that fruitlessly clings to tradition, it’s another issue entirely to send the following - much more troubling - message to its toxic fandom: “Your voice matters and we’re listening.” If you desperately wanted Rey’s parents to be related to a legacy character, if you wanted Rose to be marginalized into oblivion, if you wanted a clear explanation for Supreme Leader Snoke, or if you wanted a non-stop stream of MacGuffins and fetch quests loaded with sly references, then The Rise of Skywalker is the perfect remedy for your The Last Jedi woes. The first words of the film’s opening crawl sets the tone for the franchise’s most ossified entry: “The dead speak!” Following The Last Jedi in terms of chronology, but not in spirit, Rise establishes that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned from the dead, pulling the strings of the First Order from the shadows. There’s not much more to the paper-thin plot, as General Leia Organa’s (the late Carrie Fisher) ragtag resistance once again strives to defeat a sinister super-weapon. If there’s one word to distill the film to its purest essence, it would be “frenzied.” The Rise of Skywalker wears its deficit of attention on its sleeve, often opening doors without bothering to close them: There are subplots about Poe Dameron’s (Oscar Isaac) shrouded past, Finn’s (John Boyega) big secret, and even a rebel Stormtrooper movement, but the film clearly doesn’t have the narrative economy to effectively explore any of them. And for such a manic film, much of the plot feels strangely inert - most of its busy-ness is tied up in fetch quests and poorly explained MacGuffins. Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League) love to wheel-spin; whether it’s rebooting C3PO’s (Anthony Daniels) memory or chasing a nonsensical Sith Wayfinder, The Rise of Skywalker chugs along with enervated purpose. There are, however, still moments left over to enjoy in the film. The entire cast gives it their all when it comes to the frantic adventure, and it’s especially fun to see Ian McDiarmid chew up the scenery as Emperor Palpatine once again, even if his resurrection is largely misguided. And Adam Driver finally gets a chance to flex some playfulness and levity along with his signature Kylo Ren dourness, even providing the few emotional moments of Rise that do land. In addition, the film is also quite pretty to look at; Dan Mindel returns after The Force Awakens as director of photography, giving its empty spectacle at least a veneer of lush beauty. Rian Johnson, in a Radio.com interview, railed against the propensity to bend over backwards and please fans. “I think approaching any creative process with [making fandoms happy] would be a mistake that would lead to probably the exact opposite result,” Johnson said. “I want to be shocked, I want to be surprised, I want to be thrown off-guard, I want to have things recontextualized, I want to be challenged as a fan when I sit down in the theater.” It’s a sentiment I largely agree with. Unfortunately, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the exact opposite of the daring challenges offered by The Last Jedi. An empty vessel crafted specifically to be filled by the lowest-common-denominator, it’s indicative of the lack of forethought put into the new sequel trilogy in the first place. It’s supremely disappointing to see that of the endless possibilities available to be painted on the Star Wars canvas, The Rise of Skywalker chose to erase its predecessor and retreat into its own safety.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 28, 2021"," With the holiday season comes another ""Star Wars"" film. Except this year, fans are walking into the theater with the bitter-sweet knowledge that this one marks the end of the ""Star Wars"" saga as we know it. Number IX in the series, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" isn't particularly novel in its treatment of plot or characters. In fact, both carry over from prior films, some with more weight than others. But this final installment does exactly what fans of the series want it to: it strikes at the ""Aw look who's back! Remember that! This feels familiar!"" cord, allowing nostalgia and some fun, fast, flirty fight sequences to close up a property over 40 years old. (Next is where I disclose a summary of the film. If you haven't seen it and don't want to know general plot points, then perhaps read no further. You know, just to be safe.) The film picks up where 2017's ""The Last Jedi"" left off: the Resistance is hanging on by its thinnest thread yet. General Leia (Carrie Fisher) oversees the troops, but gives special attention to Rey (Daisy Ridley) who spends her time training alone in the forest, perfecting Jedi-mind tricks like fighting using only her intuition and levitating above the ground as she searches for the voices of Jedis past. Meanwhile, modern day-Hamlet Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), leader of the First Order, is drawn to remote planet Exegol where he discovers Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) still alive and teasing an offer too good to be true: kill the last Jedi and be by his side while they rule over the galaxy. For those of you with poor memories or little knowledge of the ""Star Wars"" universe, Palpatine has been the overarching villain of the series since his first appearance in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". In his youth, he dissolved the governing body in favor of imperial rule, electing himself supreme leader. He was Darth Vader's boss until, as always happens, student killed master. But he's back now (somehow) in zombified form, eager to continue the reign of the Sith empire and push the dark side's propaganda onto the universe. Kylo Ren is the key for him to destroy the last Jedi, Rey. But Kylo Ren has his own agenda, and they play a game of cat and mouse, using their special connection to project their consciousness throughs space to one another. Rey, with the help of friends Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and adorable BB-8, is on an intergalactic quest to find the pathfinder that will show her the way to Exegol so she can finally learn her true identity and confront the evil Palpatine. The crew hops from planet to planet, always narrowly evading the First Order until they find what they are looking for. Rey, meanwhile, is fighting her own battle. She can feel the darkness creeping up inside her. It doesn't help that her attraction to Kylo Ren upsets her Jedi mindfulness. When Rey learns that she is <<>redacted spoiler<>>, her resolve to kill Palpatine, convert Kylo Ren back to the side his parents fought for all their lives and keep her friends safe is tested in an epic final battle with a few deaths, but plenty of gratifying moments to close out the saga. With J.J. Abrams back at the helm - we love Rian Johnson, but the new string of ""Star Wars"" films is Abrams' baby - ""The Rise of Skywalker"" doesn't attempt to do too much in its allotted runtime, something that could have made the film implode. It introduces very few new characters, and the ones it does, Poe's mask-wearing former cohort (Keri Russell) and a runaway Stormtrooper (Naomi Ackie), even feel unnecessary despite their limited screen time. There is a lot of flying and shooting; the dialogue often takes a backseat to the action. But that's what we want and need and love about a series that expands the universe it lives in with each installation. Despite all the other noise, it is Rey who is our focus. She's been the driving force of the new series (Episodes VII-IX) and she deserves this conclusion to her story which is also the resolution (for now) to the conflict of dark versus light, good versus evil. It's all a bit cliche, sure, but the duality of those themes is played out tactfully and with enough newness to make the film interesting. Avid fans will enjoy the sprinkling of Easter eggs that litter the film, the most obvious of which include Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Lando Calrissian and the ghost of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) returning to deliver his iconic line one more time. At the end of the day, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" came, saw and entertained. It won't be flooding the Academy with Oscar nominations, but it will delight those who matter most. For now, may the Force be with you.",POSITIVE

"Jan 27, 2021"," Joonas Suotamo is Chewbacca, Oscar Isaac is Poe Dameron, Daisy Ridley is Rey and John Boyega is Finn in STAR WARS:  THE RISE OF SKYWALKERLucasfilm Ltd. CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A long time ago, in what now feels like a galaxy far, far away, I distinctly remember hearing a rumor my favorite movie, “Star Wars,” was actually meant to be part of a nine-episode saga. The prospect of more “Star Wars” movies was the kind of thing that got a kid like me, who cherished the empty box he once got for Christmas that only had pictures of “Star Wars” action figures on it, up in the morning. There were doubts along the way -- first in 1983 following “Return of the Jedi” and again in 2005 after “Revenge of the Sith” -- that we’d ever see all nine of those films. But, some 42 years later, here we are. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” represents the end to the beloved epic space opera George Lucas created many decades ago. Expectations are through the roof, especially after the film’s predecessor, “The Last Jedi,” left some fans saying they had a bad feeling about it. The standalone “Solo,” the most recent “Star Wars” film till now, didn’t exactly light a spark of enthusiasm either or instill confidence in Disney’s stewardship of the franchise. So, does “The Rise of Skywalker” deliver a satisfying conclusion to the saga or will your opinion of “Star Wars” turn to the dark side? “The Rise of Skywalker” feels like a big giant “f--- you” to “The Last Jedi.” That was my working headline for this post. Being charged with the final movie in the biggest pop culture phenomenon ever is a huge responsibility. Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams had a lot of questions to answer and people to please. At the top of that list of people: himself. Abrams recently took a shot at “The Last Jedi” director Rian Johnson, calling his approach to the saga as “meta” and saying that people don’t go to “Star Wars"" to be told, “This doesn’t matter.” Abrams was referring specifically to “The Force Awakens,” the 2015 reboot he directed. So, Abrams spends a considerable amount of time in “The Rise of Skywalker” un-doing pretty much everything Johnson un-did in Episode VIII. The Knights of Ren? They’re back. Rey’s nobody parents? Not nobodies anymore. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)? Relegated, undeservedly, to the background. Some of the housekeeping is minor (Admiral Ackbar has a kid!), but some of it (Kylo Ren’s mask!) is distracting. More signficantly, Abrams’ course-correcting results in a movie that feels more like a sequel to “The Force Awakens” than it does to “The Last Jedi,” backing the story into a messy, convoluted corner. In short, if you preferred the subversiveness of “The Last Jedi” over the paint-by-numbers of “The Force Awakens,” this isn’t the film you’re looking for. THE DEAD SPEAK! Those are the first three words of the movie’s customary opening crawl. It’s no secret that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the prequels and original trilogy is back because a.) the movie needed a villain after Snoke was killed in the previous film and b.) these things always come full circle. The problem: none of it really makes any sense. Not only is there no reason for Palpatine to be alive other than the film needs him to be, his return is never fully explained. Other characters inexplicably appear at just the right moment like in a shortened season of “Game of Thrones.” The galaxy has always been full of plot holes, but there are more here than in a block of blue-milk cheese. Instead of coherence we get familiarity as Abrams relies on recycled tropes from “The Force Awakens” and previous films. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) go in search of a map to Palpatine as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) chases them across the galaxy with designs on turning Rey to the dark side by enticing her with secrets about her parents. It’s true. All of it.  Don’t get the wrong impression. This isn’t a negative review. The film indeed has hurdles to clear, but if you’re able to get past all of the above -- and you should -- you’ll discover “The Rise of Skywalker” is a blast, a rousing non-stop thrill ride that packs the emotional wallop you’d expect from a final chapter. No one’s ever really gone. Much of the film’s emotion comes from seeing the original trilogy characters in their final appearances on screen. Call it fan service if you want, but Billy Dee Williams is a joy in his return as Lando. In his most signifcant screentime since “Return of the Jedi,” Daniels crushes it, turning what had become an annoying character back into the Threepio that first captured our hearts. It’s a kick to see Mark Hamill finally get to play Luke as both a Force ghost and as a young Jedi Master training Leia in a flashback. Speaking of Leia, the late Carrie Fisher is radiant as the iconic princess. How Abrams pieced together a seamless performance from previously unused footage of Fisher is one of the film’s triumphs. Both the character and actress are given a touching send-off. If you’re not already crying by then, a surprise cameo by another original cast member should do the trick. Search your feelings. Make no mistake about it, this is Rey and Kylo Ren’s film. Their “Force bond,"" something Abrams convenienty kept from “The Last Jedi,"" is stronger than ever. The chemistry between the Ridley and Driver is undeniable as they navigate the peripheries of the Jedi and Sith. And you thought your relationship was complicated! The resolution of their story might not please everybody -- there were audible groans at the screening I attended -- but the journey should move, if not bowl you over like a speeding Rathtar. Rebellions are built on hope. Abrams paints inside the lines, but it’s still a wondrous canvas. “The Rise of Skywalker” is more a star chase than a full-blown star war, but the lightsaber duel on the sinking remains of the Death Star and the climactic battle on a Star Destroyer are worthy set pieces in franchise lore. Finn and Poe are an intergalactic buddy cop comedy waiting to happen. The film is full of twists, turns, surprises and reveals. Some you’ll see a parsec away, others not so much. Loose-ends are neatly tied up, mostly anyway. A nostalgic epilogue on Tattooine plants the seeds for possible future films. The Force will be with you, always. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a flawed, if not safe film. Even the title is a misdirect. Is it worth the 42-year wait? No movie could live up to that expectation. Still, there are enough reminders of why you fell in love with “Star Wars” in the first place to make you feel like a kid again. A kid who never has to wonder if those nine films will ever get made.

"Dec 17, 2020"," There comes a point when studios need to understand that fan service can only do so much heavy lifting with a film. It requires a convincing narrative, strong characterizations, and a commitment to taking risks to elevate a film beyond the pablum of box-checking. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is not the film Disney should have made, it’s the film fans demanded to their own detriment. As the final film in the Skywalker Saga, The Rise of Skywalker is an overlong mess that tries to tie every single other film into the narrative without doing so convincingly. The film features countless cameos and throwbacks to the prior films that it almost feels like a documentary about the saga itself rather than a fully-formed idea of a film. As Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training under the tutelage of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), the threat of a thought-dead villain threatens the forward momentum of the rebellion while Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) work to find his location. Through a series of roadblocks, all three continue trying to find the necessary course while Rey continues to insist that only she can stop the threat. Nearly every character that has dotted the landscape of the last four-plus decades of films features at some point in the film. The prequels see the least representation, but the originals are well represented with the likes of Fisher, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Billy Dee Williams all making requisite appearances. It’s a film almost entirely built off of fan service without giving them anything suitably deep or thought-provoking to latch onto. The lackluster screenplay by Chris Terrio and J.J. Abrams struggles to find something worthy to say that doesn’t devolve into pointless regurgitation of series tropes and characterizations. Further, characters with a great deal of promise like Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) have been sidelined while new characters like Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) were added with seemingly little need. A great deal of effort has also been made to retcon the prior outing from Rian Johnson simply because fans were unreasonably angry about it, the end result is something that feels almost half-baked. That isn’t to say that the film doesn’t work. Fans are sure to be enthralled by the movie even if some are disappointed by the direction the final film ultimately took. Those fan service moments largely excite and there are plenty of emotion-filled moments thanks to John Williams’ always-exciting score. The problem is and always will be J.J. Abrams who has never been a fan of creating his own unique vision. Every franchise he gets his hands on is stripped bare of its essence and retrofitted to his exacting mediocrity. If he’s not outright copying other, better work (Super 8, Star Trek 1 & 2, The Force Awakens), he’s creating something as unchallenging and frequently dull as The Rise of Skywalker.",POSITIVE
"Dec 7, 2020"," umors of puppetmaster Emperor Palpatine’s existence persist, causing Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to venture off in search of the hidden world of the Sith, while the meager remnants of the Resistance struggle to find support. Despite the thunderous theme music and the iconic yellow text crawl, the events summed up in this opening are perhaps the least eventful – and most unnecessary – of all the “Star Wars” films to date. Clearly, it’s expected that this preamble occur, even if there’s no need. In the initial moments, a new alien species is seen, new structures are unearthed, and elements of the otherworldly Dark Side antagonists are glimpsed – even if fashioned for little more than a single scene. Back in 1977 when “Star Wars” first debuted, the Sith were the sleeker, hipper, edgier, better-dressed brethren to the Jedi; the rebellious younger brother of sorts. But here, they generate a horror movie vibe, as if inhabiting the world of a grim, modernized vision of Frankenstein’s monster. After all these years, the villains aren’t as cool as they are simply icky. Though the opening reveals some not-so-surprising revelations (spoiler-type items are introduced quickly so as not to keep audiences waiting for what they know to be inevitable – particularly from the film’s advertising, which gives away the setup), a dependable action sequence follows, again transitioning between new imagery – from an icy, Borg-like planetoid, to a stalagmitic region, and then to a green gaseous world – as if to cram as many fresh environments into the mix as possible. And it all leads to intermediary activities, including Rey (Daisy Ridley) continuing her training under the casual guidance of Leia (Carrie Fisher), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) using the Millennium Falcon to rendezvous with a spy, and Ren coordinating the assemblage of the Final Order (a monstrous fleet of soldiers and warships combining to finally wipe out the opposition). Plus, Rey must eventually find out why her abilities with the Force continue to grow. “Never be afraid of who you are.” Since this closing chapter to the sequel trilogy is once again helmed by J.J. Abrams, he has a rare opportunity to undo – or correct – the many things that former writer/director Rian Johnson did to the storyline. But right from the start, Abrams embraces heavy homages to the original trilogy, which border on disagreeable repetition rather than welcomed reappearances. Neatly tying together Johnson’s additives or restoring Abrams’ own concepts appear as trivial concerns. A round-table meeting with sharply-uniformed, uncertain, First Order officers ends in a typical Force-choke; a desert planet is overpopulated with alien denizens, much like the many establishments on Tatooine; the Knights of Ren, a gang of intimidating Jedi trainees sporting barbaric short-range weapons, feel all too similar to Snoke’s crimson-armored Praetorian Guards (themselves a twist on Palpatine’s Royal Guards) – or even The Children of Thanos (it’s difficult at times for certain concepts in “Star Wars” not to resemble something from the Marvel universe, or vice versa); and a Death Star-type infiltration retreads much of the Vader/Obi-Wan showdown and the Leia rescue (though the architectural comparisons are amusing, hinting at the evolution of the Imperials into the First Order). And, disappointingly, there’s still no answer as to who or what Snoke was supposed to be – obviously an idea that fizzled out when the role was deemed dispensable. As in the previous episodes, plenty of contrivances populate the premise. A convenient Sith Wayfinder is the only clue to locating an unknown planet; conveniently, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) returns for an extended cameo; a First Order Captain’s medallion is conveniently handed to Poe for his very next act of espionage; and Poe just happens to know a droid-hacker when a droid needs to be hacked. How convenient. There are also too many just-in-the-nick-of-time sequences to count. Nevertheless, the film also knows how to blend in with the “Star Wars” adventures that preceded it, crafting new vehicles, monsters, technology, weaponry, costumes, and visual splendor, even if all of it is used in the same kinds of chases, battles, dogfights, and rescue missions from before. Yet Rey gets to do some stunning things with the Force, proving to be more formidable than ever; C-3PO is utilized in spectacular ways for comic relief, representing a dependable return to the humor of the original trilogy; and plenty of practical effects and rubbery puppetry highlight the charm of tangible props (diminutive droidsmith Babu is one of the best examples). The stakes are higher, the allies are scarcer, and the enemies more plentiful, building to a grand climax. Of course, with the shift in writing comes the jettisoning of a few major characters, backtracking on bits of history and themes, and a romantic counterpart reshuffle. Yet the conclusion is rife with jaw-dropping sets, lightsaber duels, emotional confrontations, and sentimental throwbacks to recognizable elements not only from the original trilogy but also from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” bringing to an end (if only temporarily) a remarkably vast collection of cinematic legends and lore, and an acclaimed legacy of sci-fi fantasy prominence.

"Nov 27, 2020"," Set after the events of The Last Jedi – which saw the resistance at their weakest – we are thrown straight into the action as Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) look to finally defeat the First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Add on the returning threat of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) and the pieces all appear in place for an epic conclusion that could leave the majority satisfied. However, what follows, while satisfying on certain levels, suffers from a tirade of problems that will leave many frustrated. To keep this review as spoiler free as possible, I won’t get into specifics,but it is safe to say that Adam Driver is the stand out performer. As Kylo Ren, he has always been a powerful presence on screen that balances both the light and the dark. In The Last Jedi his internal conflict was at a tipping point. With The Rise of Skywalker we see how far these choices have taken him and whether anything can bring him back from the darkness. Daisy Ridley has now comfortably found her stride with the character of Rey and has been able to portray an incredible depth of emotion. She is given a lot of material to work with here and she does well to help make it believable through her grounded performance. It is however sad to report that the screentime of a lot of fan favourites such as Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) is lacking. Moved to the background when their performances were highlights of the sequel trilogy, it was disheartening to see these characters reduced to set dressing in favour of new characters with little backstory. Outside of the main trio of heroes, we do not get a chance to see many more of the heroes to shine. Even newcomers Jannah (Naomi Ackie) and Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) only serve to further plot and do not feel full formed as characters themselves. Jannah in particular feels underutilised, especially when you consider her characters backstory and its connection to another of the lead characters. Something hard to deny is that John Williams has done some incredible work with the score. Using elements from all his previous work, as well as fresh interpretations, the soundtrack is full of life and truly lives up to the incredibly high standards that Williams has set for himself. Without the score, The Rise of Skywalker’s biggest moments of levity would perhaps not ring quite as strong as Williams finds the perfect moment to elevate  emotions. Having scored every episode of the Skywalker Saga, it seems fitting that Williams ends on perhaps his most powerful yet. One thing that became clear in The Rise of Skywalker was how much of an impact Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi had on how we view the Star Wars franchise. At the time, there was a lot of controversy surrounding the film, but now two years on we can see how Johnson’s interpretation and reflective look on our heroes and how we perceive them was perhaps a one of a kind moment. The Rise of Skywalker feels like a missed opportunity to continue the incredible themes and ideas started by Johnson. Plot threads that were resolved previously become reopened as though to undo previous work. Where The Last Jedi looked to be its own entity despite what fans may believe, The Rise of Skywalker looks to please fans without wanting to have a reason to do so. Some choices feel made specifically to appease the toxic side of the fandom and in the end feel calculated decisions not by a free filmmaker but someone terrified by their audience.  The Rise of Skywalker offers a lot of good material for fans of the sequel trilogy as we finally see the heroic trio fighting together and adventuring, much like Luke, Han and Leia had done previously. Those moments feel joyful and what Star Wars is about is feeling joy. While the conclusion of this film will leave some unhappy and others shocked, their is a sense that the past is being honoured, and circle that started with Anakin is brought to a poetic conclusion. The film is far from perfect but offers enough action and heart to satisfy the majority of moviegoers. A better film lives somewhere within this story,  but I am left with a sense of hope that the future of this franchise still shines bright.",POSITIVE
"Oct 19, 2020"," Let's get this out of the way up top: I like Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I really do. It's full of energy, it never lets the gas up. The performances, especially the leads, are all top shelf. Carrie Fisher, through the use of archival footage and such, is on a giant screen one last time and that is a good thing. The emotional journeys are moving and fulfilling. The twists and turns and surprises are all built on foundations of what came before. John Williams' score is toe-curlingly good.The movie is eye-candy and ear-candy of the highest order. But it is also the most pandering movie of the year. Maybe of the decade. Endgame, you can see yourself out the door, Skywalker will take your seat at the table. It creaks under the weight of all of the fan service. The heroes land on a planet looking for whatsit, there is a festival going on, someone mentions the festival occurs every 42 years. You can do the math since 1977. There are cameos and Easter eggs and callbacks being dropped every few minutes. Some of these are clunky, some of them are not. Some cause eyeballs to roll all the way back, some cause a smile or a tear. Some might call it nostalgia gone crazy, some might call it trying to play it safe. And anyone expecting more of the franchise breaking weirdness, and giddiness of Last Jedi, well, I'm sorry. This ain't that film. I don't hide my love for Last Jedi, not at all. I love every overstuffed moment, every unexpected narrative turn. and every Kurosawa influenced frame of that billion plus dollar grossing bit of oddness. To see some aspects of Last Jedi treated with what appears to be disrespect kind of hurts. So, yeah, Rise of Skywalker is fulfilling the promise of Force Awakens. It's a Star Wars movie that is trying not to upset anyone. It's not trying to reinvent the franchise, it's trying to bring it to an end. But, yes, it sticks the landing. It sure does. I'll confess - there may have been a tear or two when I heard John Williams' Finale start to play and the credits started to roll. This is it, the saga is over. This story, with all of its repeating motifs and themes, is finally over. I wonder if wee me, sitting in that theatre a lifetime ago, would understand that one day he would be writing a bunch of words about the last piece of this story that essentially come down to ""movie good"". I think wee me might be very confused by this. There was no Episode 4, no A New Hope, when wee me saw Star Wars. It was just that, Star Wars. I think I might be old. What's it about? Well, there is a tribe of cats called the Jellicles and they've come together for the annual Jellicle Ball and for some reason Dame Judi Dench is a cat but has human hands. Nice try. Writing about nothing has become a bit of a superpower in this spoiler adverse age we currently live in. I've had lots of practice, what with the Marvel movies and the other Star Wars properties and other comic book movies and look, I'm doing it right now. Nice try, indeed. At its worst moments, Rise of Skywalker feels like a film made with notes from Reddit. It's clunky and you can almost feel the expectations and desperation to please coming off of the screen. At its best, it feels like a natural conclusion to a story that has been told over decades. Remove the fan service, you will still have a heck of a genre movie here. And the cast elevates everything, from the odd plotting to the undercooked dialogue. Will it break the genre wall at the Oscars? Nope. Is Rise of Skywalker what it is intended to be? Is it a piece of crowd pleasing, popcorn entertainment where some things blow up real good? Yep. Don't over think it, it's a Star Wars movie. No-one can hear you giggle in space. is it worth seeing in a theatre? Yes, you crazy person. A million times yes. This thing looks amazing. It's big and it is beautiful. There are so many moments that I can't talk about here, but trust me, Rise of Skywalker is a feast. Now, get back to work.",POSITIVE

"Jul 28, 2020"," The Skywalker saga is brought to a close with this, the final film in the main storyline canon, tasked with bringing the curtain down in a way befitting of the moment. Except The Rise of Skywalker does not even come close. The magic that made audiences fall in love with a galaxy far, far away has been erased. In its place comes the galactic equivalent of an audit; reconciled, bland, an empty record of the originals. The result is perhaps the least inspiring entry the series has ever endured. On paper there is so much promise. Somehow, the sinister Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has survived all these years, plotting his revenge. Rey (Daisy Ridley) has to stand against both Palpatine and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who knows a shocking secret about Rey’s heritage. Yet quickly you realise that bringing back Palpatine is one of the safest, least creative things Disney and J.J. Abrams could possibly have done. And that’s just the beginning. The story and its execution stinks of needless course correction following The Last Jedi. Gone are the fascinating new avenues and ideas introduced in the last film, Abrams bulldozing over everything with what he introduced in The Force Awakens. The Knights of Ren, Rey’s parents and planet-killing weaponry are just some of the things brought back, resulting in a convoluted story that throws the entire Age of Resistance trilogy off kilter. Worse still is that newer characters are cruelly pushed out, none more so than Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). Largely forgotten also is General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), granted an inexplicable and hastily justified character arc, and even Finn (John Boyega), cursed with increasingly little to do as Rey’s power grows. Poe (Oscar Isaac), meanwhile, is lazily thrown more love interests instead of building on how he grew in The Last Jedi, Abrams confirming how disinterested he is in detailed characterisation. Some fan service is not unwelcome, but The Rise of Skywalker feels like it was based on an over-enthusiastic Reddit post. The endless stream of nods, references and direct quotes borders on laziness. It feels woefully uninspiring – even the sequences that try and spin something new barely register. This is as cold, calculated and profane as studio-produced efforts get; a paint-by-numbers kind of movie. The zip and wonder of Star Wars has been butchered. There are some moments to savour, all featuring Rey and Kylo Ren. Their lightsaber duel on the wave-battered ruins of the second Death Star is riveting, and the strange connection that has brought them together is concluded in a way that, while it still lacks great surprises, at least feels right. Ridley and Driver have settled into their roles wonderfully, carrying the script through their most dramatic encounters with enough gravitas to feel like they at least are getting the farewell they deserve. Welcome, also, is the return of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), another instance where there is more than surface-level gratification.  This is not how it should have ended. Star Wars made its mark with imagination, fuelled by the bravery to introduce new ideas and leave stars in the audience’s eyes. Instead, Disney have decided that a lazy slog through tested content was the way to go, and it is unforgivable. The Rise of Skywalker simply lacks the spark that has kept this franchise going for so long, replaced by a poisonous hesitation to stray too far from what the fanbase would likely demand. It leaves many questions unanswered, a feeling of dissatisfaction deep in your stomach, and a strange sense of paralysing disappointment.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 25, 2020"," Sitting there waiting for John Williams’ opening fanfare at the start of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, I harbored one apprehension: That despite their assurances that this ninth film in the series would bring the entire 42-year Star Wars saga to a close, the Sith Lords at Disney would nevertheless concoct a cliff-hanger ending, teasing yet another three-part go-round with the Skywalker clan. Breathe easy: The Mouse House has admirably resisted going over to the Dark Side. Rise of Skywalker has a fully resolved fade-out, leaving no one in jeopardy and the bad guys vanquished. (Spare me the “spoiler alert” e-mails: What, you thought the Star Wars saga would end like The Hateful Eight?) Will those who still wear their hair in Princess Leia buns or who argue about whether Han Solo shot first be satisfied with the way director J.J. Abrams and his army of writers have resolved the tale? Who knows? But for the casual observer — albeit one who since 1977 has seen every Star Wars movie during its opening week — this is a pretty satisfactory wrap-up. The iconic opening text rambles on about rebels and an evil emperor, and then Chapter 9 picks up right where Chapter 8 left off: A ragtag army of rebels is holed up on some distant planet, desperately trying to figure out a way to resist a powerful galactic dictatorship that has developed a super weapon capable of destroying entire planets. Now, you may ask: Wasn’t that the exact same plot of the original Star Wars? Well yes, yes it was. But back then the chief bad guy was the Emperor Palpatine, and the rebels were led by Princess Leia. Okay, well, yeah, this time the Emperor remains (Ian McDiarmid, still playing the role after 36 years), and so does Leia (Carrie Fisher, still playing the role three years after her passing). But that’s definitely where the similarities end. Except for the hallway shootouts between our heroes and the Storm Troopers (terrible shots as ever) and the climactic dogfight in which mosquito-like space fighters wreak havoc on enemy ships the size of Manhattan (you just need to know where to aim). And of course there’s the brave young heroine in white (Daisy Ridley) who’s got multiple handsome guys hopelessly in love with her. Ah! So, here’s an element in Rise of Skywalker that was definitely not in the first Star Wars movie: A repentant villain performs the ultimate act of self-sacrifice to save the life of an innocent. Ha! That didn’t happen … until the end of The Return of the Jedi. The point here, I guess, is that repetition isn’t a glitch in the Star Wars universe — it’s a feature. Not unlike Medieval passion plays, for which audiences tolerated only the most minor variations on a theme, the Star Wars movies vary primarily in the people speaking the lines and the exact nature of the deus ex machina that will deliver our heroes from the brink of destruction this time. The chief contribution Abrams has made in producing the last three Star Wars movies has been in assembling an appealing cast (as opposed to George Lucas’ three prequels, which seemed to have held their casting calls at Madame Tussaud’s). Daisy Ridley, beautiful and bad-ass, brings Marvel-caliber energy to the role of Rey, a Jedi. Adam Driver gives the most thoughtful and sympathetic of his three turns as conflicted bad guy Kylo Ren. We still don’t get enough time with Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Keri Russell as hotshot fighter pilots — I wouldn’t mind following that trio in some future Star Wars spin-off (but not a sequel). And, of course, Abrams has had the advantage of recruiting Star Wars veterans whose audience goodwill is automatic. I won’t spill how many of them show up here, but it’s well known that Abrams employed previously unused footage of Fisher to cobble together a supporting role for her here. It’s the most ambitious gamble of the film, and surprisingly successful: Despite the fact that the entire script was reverse engineered to accommodate the snippets of film at hand, Princess Leia’s part in the narrative is not only substantial — it’s central to the plot. No one is deluding themselves into thinking Disney is flushing the whole Star Wars universe. But it’s clear that the whole Skywalker saga ran its course a few films ago, and now is the time to stop. For one thing, if trends continued, the next installment would have required the return of Jar-Jar Binks. Featured image: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.

"Jul 24, 2020"," After J.J. Abrams reignited the “Star Wars” franchise for a new generation in “The Force Awakens” (2015), Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” (2017) didn’t quite deliver, as Luke Skywalker told Rey he had three lessons to teach her, but only revealed two. This weekend, Abrams delivers a hard course correct in “Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker,” fulfilling every promise with plenty of fan service and wrapping things up without ambiguity. If anything, the movie plays it too safe with everything tied up too neatly, but as a final chapter for these characters, it’s a solidly satisfying conclusion. After the defeat of Snoke, Rey (Daisy Ridley) joins back up with Resistance pals Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (Hasan Taj, Lee Towersey), BB-8 (Brian Herring, Dave Chapman), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher). Rey still suffers visions connecting her to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who wants her to join the Dark Side where Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) returns to lead the Sith army’s First Order. This closing chapter smartly focuses on the mental bond between Rey and Ren, as Ridley and Driver take center stage. Ridley starts out running a training course in the woods like Clarice Starling, reminding us how she’s become an inspiring heroine for young girls growing up with Katniss Everdeen and Wonder Woman. Driver has become an even bigger star, earning Oscar buzz for his role in “Marriage Story,” but first fusing together his Darth Vader-style dark helmet for a cool new mask of molten welding. Their spiritual connection of crossover communications is the most visually compelling element by Abrams, who works with editors Maryann Brandon and Stefan Grube to intercut Rey and Ren’s shared experiences when they are in different locations. They can even affect the other’s world in tangible ways, a fascinating addition to the powers of The Force, which has always been the strength of George Lucas’ genius creation. Co-written by Abrams and Chris Terrio (“Argo”), the script offers plenty of popcorn munching delight. Babu Frik hilariously mumbles for comic relief like Baby Groot, Poe trades sassy banter with Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell) and Rey wages two killer lightsaber battles. At one point, a weapon becomes a clue-finder like something out of Indiana Jones, while John Williams reminds us he can still provide nostalgic goosebumps. On the downside, the script practically abandons the romance between Finn and Rose, which is odd considering it was such a driving force of “The Last Jedi.” In fact, Rose is barely on screen at all, while Finn starts to offer a confession but never finishes. Other characters like Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata appear briefly to show face but without much plot involvement, while Domhnall Gleeson gets a laughable line as General Hux. Amid the catchphrases, a great screenplay should most importantly keep us guessing. Here the “surprises” may be satisfying in closing the story loop without rocking the existing canon, but they are underwhelming as a viewer craving twists and turns. This is partly due to over exposure by trailers already revealing the biggest moments. It’s great to see Billy Dee Williams back as Lando Calrissian for the first time in 36 years, but it would have been much more exciting if we didn’t see it coming. The same goes for the trailers revealing the return of Emperor Palpatine. It’s a pretty lazy choice to bring back the villain from “Return of the Jedi,” feeling like we’ve seen it all before with Ewoks. It makes the 1983 victory less important now that we know Palpatine survived. The writers should have built a new foe, rather than rehash an old one. Alas, at least we get closure to Rey’s long-debated identity crisis. Don’t worry, we won’t spoil it here, but let’s just say that it is definitively answered. That’s not to say it’s very rewarding, considering all of the juicier fan conspiracies since 2015. The result is more of a shrug than a shocker, no where near Darth Vader’s iconic “I am your father” reveal from “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980), which remains the franchise’s best installment. Now, after nine official episodes, this is the curtain call for these characters as the end of the franchise’s third trilogy. Looking back, I wish they had waited three years in between chapters like the original trilogy. Even the disappointing prequel trilogy made us wait several years in between releases. Instead, they rushed out “Rogue One” (thumbs up) and “Solo” (thumbs down) as in-between offshoots that diluted the brand. Disney will now pump the box-office brakes by focusing on the Disney+ series “The Mandalorian.” This is probably the best medium for die-hard fans to continue exploring the “Star Wars” universe as old-school fans jump off the ride with fatigue. Regardless of which camp you’re in, we can all agree that the big-screen installments should go away for a while and make us miss them. Then, if a new movie ever does arrive, let’s leave Luke, Leia and Solo in the past and explore a new galaxy, far, far away.

"Jul 17, 2020"," The final chapter of the epic Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker, finally hits theaters this week, and although there are so many questions about what becomes of the many characters we've grown to love over the past four decades, there's also something many LGBTQ+ fans of the franchise are begging to finally know: do we exist in a galaxy far, far away? Picking up a year after where 2017's The Last Jedi left off, The Rise of Skywalker starts with the Resistance (or what's left of it) still recovering from their last encounter with the First Order under the leadership of Supreme Leader Snoke. Using the most diabolical forces of the Dark Side, the infamous Emperor Palpatine has mysteriously re-emerged back to life as the leader of the Sith and is planning, once again, to completely take over the galaxy and put a permanent end to the Jedi. Without spoiling too much, the rest of the movie focuses mostly on our main hero Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last known Jedi and de facto face of the Resistance, as she tries to put an end to the Emperor's wicked plot despite attempts by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to lure her to the Dark Side. Though they were mostly kept apart in the two previous Star Wars films, Rey also finally gets to team up with Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) on an urgent Resistance mission, and their dynamic feels a lot like the beloved friendship between Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. Of course, many Star Wars fans know that ever since they were introduced to us in 2015's The Force Awakens, viewers wanted more than just friendship between Finn and Poe. So will The Rise of Skywalker give loyal FinnPoe shippers and LGBTQ+ Star Wars fans the queer romance and representation we've been desperately wanting for the past 42 years? Yes and no. And while we did get a speck (not a crumb, a speck) of LGBTQ+ rep, it wasn't from Finn and Poe, the two characters fans have been feverishly shipping together for years. In fact, it feels like The Rise of Skywalker goes out of its way to reinforce the notion that Finn and Poe aren't a thing, despite their actors John Boyega and Oscar Isaac even admitting their two characters have chemistry and that they wished they could have explored that more on screen. In the film, Poe is given a love interest in the new character Zorii (Keri Russell), and the fling between Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Finn is really played up, especially during dramatic, emotional moments in the final battle with the Sith. The decision to make two unimportant background characters queer felt like such a waste, especially since more of an impact would have been made if two main characters, especially ones with as much chemistry as Finn and Poe had their queerness confirmed in canon. Despite these problems, The Rise of Skywalker didn't do anything that other films and TV shows haven't, shoehorning a small but pleasant queer moment in wherever was convenient. Is too little, too late? Oh yeah. Is it something that LGBTQ+ pop culture fans are already used to?

"Jul 14, 2020"," The power of nostalgia cannot be overestimated. J.J. Abrams, who directed the first film of the Star Wars sequel trilogy (The Force Awakens, 2015) and returns to steer the franchise to its culmination with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, is all too aware of that truism, especially in the light of the hostile fan reaction provoked by Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), in which director Rian Johnson dared to stray from the beaten path. Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker drifts back into the known orbit, treads cautiously, and falls back on old sleights. As a result, parts of the film, particularly in the last hour or so, may seem like a rehash of 1983's Return of the Jedi. Fans are unlikely to complain. However, sticking largely to established norms and mindful of what the Star Wars heroes, villains and their galactic battles - all of which are larger-than-life and have been pop culture-defining phenomena over a period of 40-plus years - mean to the fans, Abrams is unwaveringly focused on carrying the fans along. In the bargain he skips paying attention to letting The Rise Of Skywalker acquire a life and logic of its own. The weight of expectations - Star Wars Episode IX is one of the most anticipated films in the annals of Hollywood - is a heavy burden for what is meant to be the swan song of much-loved franchise. Shouldn't it have been better and brighter than any of the previous eight Star Wars episodes? It is anything but. The film is energetic and entertaining on the face of it, but if you pause to consider the finer aspects of storytelling - plotting, character development, logic and suchlike - you are likely to spot gaping holes in the structure built by Abrams, who has co-written The Rise Of Skywalker with Chris Terrio. He pays homage to the George Lucas universe, throws in a few minor visual Easter eggs and mounts a few grand scenes that look great while they last. Neither a proper expansion nor a summation of what Star Wars stands for, it falls into the cracks between conception and execution. Following Rey (Daisy Ridley, who is first-rate) and her buddies, Finn (Frank Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), as they set out to stymie the evil plans of the tyrannical First Order, the film answers a few key questions, most notably one related to the Rey's parentage, kills off a few characters, and surprisingly brings back a few others. One character who makes a comeback is the principal villain, Emperor Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who, at the end of Return of the Jedi, had been thrown down a chute and had met his end. In The Rise Of Skywalker, his revival is presented as a fait accompli without a proper explanation nor an attempt to make it believable. Palpatine is reintroduced with the express purpose of overriding Snork's surprise death in The Last Jedi. But it is anything but convincing. Much of The Rise Of Skywalker is devoted to a strategy to negate The Last Jedi, a film that sought to pull away from the George Lucas imagination of a Galaxy Far Far Away. What this necessitates for The Rise Of Skywalker is the act of drawing upon Star Wars lore to restore the links with the franchise's past and then creating its own course towards a finale. All this makes the film so dizzyingly busy that it becomes difficult in the initial hour to grasp every plot detail. This is turn leads to contrivances designed to paper over the gaps - they barely pass muster. The craftsmanship is of the highest order, the CGI is terrific, and the performances applause-worthy, but there is something about The Rise Of Skywalker that does not let it float free and rise to heights that the franchise hasn't touched before. Its finesse is of the strictly superficial kind, which is a huge disappointment for those who believed that Star Wars would end with a bang. Rey, Finn and Poe generate a fair deal of excitement, but they cannot replicate the magic that Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia worked in the original Star Wars trilogy. The Rise Of Skywalker is Daisy Ridley's film, but Boyega and Isaac do not have as much to do. It is Adam Driver who steals the show as Kylo Ren, whose telepathic connection with Rey allows him to taunt her about switching allegiance to the dark side. Palpatine has picked Kylo to be his successor. The evil emperor promises Kylo an entire army and immense power in exchange for the task of eliminating the last Jedi trainee, Rey. On the other side, Rey, having lost her master Luke, is learning the Jedi ropes from General Leia (Carrie Fisher, who appears in awkwardly spliced together scenes left out of the earlier films). Eventually, Rey decides that she must track down Palpatine and leaves the Resistance base accompanied by Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and BB. They progress towards their goal, rising level by level, as if in a video game. Only two people can stop Palpatine - Rey and Kylo - but they are on opposing sides. A lightsaber duel on a fallen Death Star and other visually striking passages abound in the film, but they are slapped together in a manner that smacks of a lack of planning, slapdash writing and generic action tics.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 14, 2020"," When the dust finally settled, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker inevitably brought back memories to something I wrote last year.  It was titled The Pitfalls of Nostalgia – a conversational look into our relationship with the convention and its excessive use and over-reliance of it in film and TV.  And yet somehow as I mull over my thoughts in summing up the final film in the Skywalker saga, somehow those words are more apparent than ever. J.J. Abrams has a deep fascination with mystery box adventures that you could probably write a thesis on it.  From LOST, Alias, Fringe, Mission Impossible 3 and even Star Trek Into Darkness, he operates this trademark style with an almost Spielbergian methodology.  The quest creates a sense of wonder and the inevitable whipped-up frenzy of speculation and discourse.  In J.J’s reality, the power surrounding the mystery serves as a powerful narrative, where questions can be layered upon mystery box upon mystery box with a countless amount of teasing that would prop up a Charlie Day conspiracy meme, instead of having to explain or confront its context. Perhaps the best example of his concept is Super 8 (arguably J.J’s strongest work in his filmography), a film enriched in Spielberg both in its nostalgia and that ‘larger than life’ adventurism bonded by family and friendship.  Whilst it does well to convey the emotional outreach with its fantastic young cast and sharp dialogue, it’s muddled turn off was its choice to change the nature of the alien, switching between a Cloverfield/Jaws obliteration of the residents to a sudden E.T. complex of an alien wanting to ‘phone home’.  In a film that feels like a mash-up of his favourite genres and themes, you can make a humble argument that the alien was a substitute for family grief.  But the truth is the twist works more as an executed jigsaw convention, something to reward an audience through its emotional overtures than catering for some constructed logic within its script. That’s not to say there’s a right or wrong way of storytelling. It’s clear he loves this tool, hence why he frequently deploys it. There’s a comfort and reliability, helping him to articulate the abundance of ideas in his mind. But like ‘observing the pattern’ as Fringe fans would say, often it comes across as an imitation that finds itself making questionable decisions rather than entertain something uniquely substantial. With this established safety net, it allows him a template to help sell the concept and introduce (or re-introduce) his characters to respond to its mystery. The overriding question that loomed over The Rise of Skywalker is whether he could finish something he started, always finding himself in a position where he leaves before a project’s completion.  Nostalgia may serve a purpose like playing a Spotify greatest hits collection, but depending on its execution, it can also leave one feeling – emptiness. It’s like playing a video game with all of its cheat codes turned on. Yes it is fun for a while, and yes, you get its immediate satisfaction, but somehow you’re left with the legacy feeling of nothing to engage from. In the case of watching Super 8, I wanted to go home and watch a Spielberg film rather than re-watch Super 8. The Rise of Skywalker falls into that same distinct trap. The Rise of Skywalker showcases the best and utmost worst of J.J. Abrams work; generic, stale, unfinished and lopsided.  Sure, it’s energetic and unapologetically visceral, but its breakneck speed for pacing can be summed up in Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) rapidly jumping to lightspeed to find his way out of trouble in the Millennium Falcon (knowing the famous ship can’t handle that kind of intensity). As if to cover over the flaws from J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio’s script, through its sheer velocity, we have no sense of what planets, city or perspective in it’s ‘blink and you’ll miss it’ overture.  The sheer nature of the move is gung-ho, reckless and brazen as you would expect from the director, but also presents a discombobulating sensation that you’ve binge-watched the entirety of Game of Thrones in a day with the fast forward speed of 10x (obviously not possible, but you get the gist of the idea). It’s easy to boil this down as “if you loved The Last Jedi, you’re gonna hate this” argument and vice versa.  That argument is far too simple for something generational, subjective and far more complicated than most people will recognise.  Irrespective of whether you enjoyed Rian Johnson’s meta-commentary experiment on The Last Jedi or not, the hindsight reality is that it took risks, risks the franchise needed to ask itself about its legacy and its subsequent role in its history.  The ultimate failure from The Rise of Skywalker falls on its basic principles of storytelling, where character arcs from its opening crawl and previous films are left in the deserted wastelands of Tatooine, where dialogue is replaced by heavy doses of exposition and characters shoehorned into cameo appearances that end up feeling like a reunion party than functioning as an integral part of the plot.  There’s an adage of “no one hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans” and yet what The Rise of Skywalker does is hand the keys over to a vocal minority by excessively pandering to their satisfaction.  It plays the game of having your cake and eating it too, trying to restore the balance as the franchise has always lived up to.  But in doing so, The Rise of Skywalker not only validates their opinions but sacrifices its own artistic voice where its merits are never earned and its dramatic beats are carelessly rushed through leaving it soulless and hollow.  The euphoria behind Star Wars should never leave you like this, and The Rise of Skywalker was fan service at its worst. I want to vehemently stress that there is nothing wrong with nostalgia and fan service. As mentioned in my article about nostalgia, I talk about how it places itself in a difficult quandary of appeasement. And yet Ryan Coogler’s Creed (for example) has utilised it better than most films would imagine.  In its myriad of options in its conversations about legacy, it offers the audience something that makes every signifying moment worthwhile – substance. In another classic example, it’s something that Netflix’s Stranger Things does so well where our emotional connection to the past is defined by our personal experiences rather than the kids themselves. They’re living in the era, oblivious of its significance and not (as most films do including The Rise of Skywalker) occasionally stop the film to acknowledge it. And as if lessons weren’t learnt from J.J.’s previous experience such as Star Trek Into Darkness, then he understands the architectural mechanisms behind nostalgia but not the reasons why that moment resonates so deeply. And judging by his brand of filmmaking (a trait which I’ve seen far too often) the nostalgia is only used as an effective means to an end, to get from point A to B and nothing more.  It’s fine as a set-up – what The Force Awakens accomplishes manages to restore faith in the aftermath of the prequel trilogy.  But as a conclusion? It deserved something far richer than proposed instead of the persistent return down memory lane that’s continually seeking validation and vindication.  Not even the brilliant John Williams and his score can escape the callbacks to the past. But heartbreakingly so, while the situation can’t be blamed solely on Abrams (returning in a near-impossible situation after the vitriolic backlash from The Last Jedi), but The Rise of Skywalker painfully confirms the lack of planning between the arcs. I’m willing to be controversial in saying Johnson had the most difficult task of the tenure, picking up the pieces from the scattergun approach left after The Force Awakens by contextualising the franchise’s bigger picture. But the unifying statement left in the aftermath by The Rise of Skywalker is the feeling of “it doesn’t matter”, undoing some of the most interesting aspects of the franchise like a damage control exercise that WB utilised after Batman v Superman (which produced Suicide Squad in its aftermath). But it’s most disappointing aspect is the genuine lack of stakes, ambition or risks with its fake-outs and sacrificial undoing which only cheapen the experience.  And as a consequence, it leaves the franchise in an undesirable place, a place defined by the safety of creature comforts, familiarity and convenience that serves only to make the universe smaller again.  Of course, change is a gamble, but judging on this effort, it’s the realisation that the franchise is happy to stick with the status quo and allow for history to repeat itself. And instead of confronting the challenges head-on, it decides to not pick up the baton and finish the marathon. That apt feeling is summed up by Rey (Daisy Ridley), a character who spent the last two films re-defining her identity, a film in which The Last Jedi conveyed lineage was not important in defining who you are, only to be told the opposite.  Some would easily say it’s a technicality, some would say it’s a complete retcon that rolls back on the intentions laid out by Rian Johnson, and some would easily say Abrams was merely fixing a ‘mess’ by giving its audience a direct sequel to The Force Awakens.  But The Rise of Skywalker spends the majority of the film re-emphasising the same point about *who* she is in the context of the franchise. The sad thing about Rey’s ultimate fate is how she already started from a position of power. By being a ‘no-one’, a new succession of force-sensitive Jedis opens the doors to new possibilities. It’s not defined by blood or some royal right or some easily convenient connection within an already convoluted legacy that happens to be problematically tied to that ‘galaxy far far away’. It’s the inspirational takeaway that anyone can be a hero, rising out of nothing in the epic struggle between good and evil. And yet the connection towards lineage with the re-assertion of a major character only asks more questions than answers. There’s an element of Spectre, the 24th Bond film in its deflating reveal, but even if this was the intention all along, to have Rey mythically connect with the previous eight films, then this parental conflict that should have been addressed right from the beginning.  It would have allowed more time with Rey to come to terms with the revelation instead of what the film does repeatedly – have her run to different planets with speed and haste. It would have been in the same pretence at how Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel, for example, was imbued with the same choice after learning her secret.  Captain Marvel is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination (which I actively discuss in my review), but at least it’s an attempt to codify her origins with a choice that bravely moves it forward.  It’s not to say these elements did not feature in The Rise of Skywalker, but its execution is clumsy and rushed, explained through tiresome lines of exposition that expect us to feel a sense of emotional shock at the revelation when its depth is shallow at best. The fact remains, pretty much every character suffers from the film’s choppy and hasty editing and execution.  The Rise of Skywalker is more concerned with getting over the next hurdle, introducing the next clue to get to this mystery rather than spend time with the characters it possesses (or introduces, and trust me there are plenty in its convoluted equation including the return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Keri Russell’s Daft Punk looking Zorri).  And by doing so, it sacrifices what has been the heart and soul of these films – character and growth. Character development is fueled by reactions rather than the choices they’ve made. We get to see Finn (John Boyega) and Poe spend more time together, but even the exchanges feel disjointed and somewhat regressive with most of their bromance moments connected with ‘wouldn’t it be cool?’ moments.  But the most disheartening was Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) who is shamefully sidelined for what I can only imagine as capitulation and cowardice to an abusive fandom rather giving her character something meaningful to do. I would have preferred The Rise of Skywalker to be the length of Avengers Endgame and The Irishman.  Call it indulgence or being spoiled after 2019 gave us a succession of 3-hour epics.  But if the length was an option to convey some of its story without the feeling of being like a meaningless blur, then it’s a luxury I would have happily endured.  It wouldn’t have solved all of its fundamental and stalemate problems, but it would have been easier to digest. And I get it, endings are HARD and writing one is EXTREMELY HARD. Not even Revenge of the Sith could accomplish it.  I’m not even going to pretend I have the perfect, iron-fisted resolution that neatly ties up a 42-year old saga.  I’m not going to pretend I have a respectable path of utilising General Leia after the tragic death of Carrie (always loved and always missed) Fisher.  And unquestionably, I’m not going to pretend I have a dignified approach to unite an already divided fandom that has been long bickering about the franchise since the release of The Empire Strikes Back.  For every generation, Star Wars has meant something different to someone.  In essence, loving Star Wars can be a religion – George Lucas (our creator in saviour) gave us this world and each of us has taken what we believe is the “best part”, consuming canonical or non-canonical books, media, video games and pretty much anything we fans can get our hands on, shaping our perspective on the franchise. Our introduction has no universal or centralised means of entry (in comparison to how we all started getting into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, with Iron Man). But based on that reality, it is something that cannot be appeased, no matter how good its intentions are, and the film caves into that idea by believing it can. Throughout popular culture, even something as prestigious as Game of Thrones struggled with it earlier this year.   The X-Files during its two-season return struggled, trying to balance out the mythology of the past with the context of the present within a short span of episodes (which was not enough). Heck, (in another context) even Star Trek Discovery bowed down to familiarity of its past, fake-out deaths and introduced the worst storyline concept for season 2 – time crystals (the less said, the better).  But again, returning to the basic plots of filmmaking, as an isolated, standalone film, it’s the sheer lack of creativity and ambition that severely hurts its wasted potential.  It is as jarring as the recent addition of ‘Maclunky’ in the new versions of A New Hope on Disney+ for an already contentious scene.  And in its desperate attempt to win everyone over, you end up watching a film that’s having a constant argument with itself, settling on a marked, checklist of requirements and targets to include as if decided by a committee. I don’t necessarily believe J.J. Abrams is a bad director. The fun he manages to encapsulate is above the qualities of the prequel trilogy. Some of the best moments come as visual statements such as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey having a force projection conversation as the camera swap between their thoughts and location.  As The Return of the Jedi in the franchise, the re-balance of the force was inevitable. It’s simplistic storytelling if somewhat predictable.  But in the immortal words of Yoda with his masterful quote of “we are what we grow beyond”, that piece of advice wasn’t adhered to.  It’s a film that’s big on spectacle but leaves nothing for audiences to take away from. Does this film derail my love of the franchise? No. For over 30 years of my life, these stories have defined me from the mythology to pure, escapist, unadulterated entertainment, regardless of whether anyone thinks “it’s just a kids movie about space wizards”.  And on the contrary, I’m still looking forward to the new trilogy, a trilogy not defined by the legacy of the past, but something that explores the universe instead of relying on bloodlines, dynasties and “keeping everything in the family”. There is no sense of enjoyment or pleasure if the same storylines are endlessly re-hashed and re-purposed when the possibilities are endless.  All it takes is a little imagination and creativity, which The Rise of Skywalker openly rejects. If you enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker for what it is, then all power to you.  Your happiness should never be defined by what others say, including myself, who is happy to be in the minority with my opinions.  But like all legacies, time will be its ultimate decider, and whether we return to The Rise of Skywalker with the same energetic verve as previous films will be a fascinating (and hopefully civil) debate for years to come.  But ultimately, it’s a film that tried too hard and ends up utilising every kitchen sink trick to make this film whole. But in my humblest opinion, it is by far the weakest out of the new trilogy, and what should have been a triumphant end to the saga, The Rise of Skywalker just ends in bitter disappointment. I actually loved both this movie and The Last Jedi, but I also love hearing alternate takes! I’m always fascinated by how these movies impact us all differently. I’m glad you enjoyed it. As mentioned, all power to you, but I thought it was let down that made way too many convenient choices and topped it up with massive doses of fan service which is not a great way to make a movie. This is not just a TROS problem, this is something that has been evident for a long time with JJ and this film IMO showed up his weakness as a director. He’s great at ideas, but the execution or concluding them just has no value. He just doesn’t know how to end it. I enjoyed Rise of Skywalker. The duel between Kylo Ren and Rey was action packed for sure. Yet, I reluctantly agree with this review. It did leave out a lot of answers us Star Wars fans so desperately need. Heck, if it wasn’t for the toxic fanboys berating Rian Johnson for supposedly “ruining” the franchise and Carrie Fisher’s passing, Disney could have made Star Wars great again. I guess some things are only great once. If there were to be a series where Rey revives the Jedi Order, that’s the least Disney owes us. Or would the “High Republic” fit that category?",NEUTRAL

"Jun 27, 2020"," A year after the devastating Battle of Crait, the Rebels have been rebuilding and trying to decide their next move. Under Leia's tutelage, Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been busy training to hone her Jedi skills. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been on his own quest: To find the Sith planet of Exegol. What he finds there sets him on a new, much more sinister path. Word gets back to the Rebels of Kylo's discovery, and Rey, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO journey to find their own way to Exegol and stop what has been unleashed. It's an odyssey that will test them all, especially Rey, who will learn who she really is as a Jedi…and a person. The Rise of Skywalker does a fantastic job of wrapping up this branch of one of the most popular and influential franchises in the history of entertainment. It is exciting, action-packed, visually impressive, lightly humorous and poignantly emotional. In short: Everything you hope a Star Wars film would be. Sitting back down in the director's chair is J.J. Abrams. He has the rather daunting undertaking of pulling together all of the threads both he and Rian Johnson have laid out over two films. Not an easy task, because they, along with George Lucas through his previous involvement, have been weaving a very detailed tapestry. Yet, amazingly, Abrams completes the task with flying colors. He has developed a rather simpler script, compared to the complexities Johnson delivered in his universe-expanding entry. There's a very straight-forward goal, and everything moves toward it. As he did with The Force Awakens, Abrams borrows bits and pieces from A New Hope. Not nearly as much this go-around, but you'll recognize them when they occur. He also, as he did a few times before, plays on our nostalgia. Through clever moments and audio/visual cues, he pays off our dedicated fandom with scenes that tug at the heartstrings and fog up the eyes. Of course, as The Last Jedi proved, not everyone is going to be satisfied. You know what? That's OK. That's the danger when creating something within a universe with a highly zealous fanbase. Many different people have many different connections to this material, and they have many different ideas on how the story should go. I myself have a very deep connection to this saga. I was three-years-old in the summer of 1977, and Star Wars is the first movie I remember seeing in theaters. I have a wonderful family memory about going to the first show opening day of Empire. I can distinctly remember the feeling of tapping the action figure packages aside to see if there was one toward the back of a row that I needed. Suffice it to say, with many more memories such as these, this franchise means a great deal to me. I've mentioned before in reviews that my first question walking out of an auditorium is, ""Was I entertained?"" No matter the style or genre, the purpose of film is entertainment. Was I entertained by The Force Awakens? Yes. Was I entertained by The Last Jedi? Yes. The same holds true for The Rise of Skywalker, too. So, if someone like me, someone whose entire life has been influenced in some part by Lucas' creation, was genuinely entertained by this film and honestly satisfied by its outcome, then what else do you need?

"Jun 10, 2020"," And so we return one final time to the Skywalker family. After Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, we are told, there will be no more stories told about the spawn of Darth Vader and their various friends, spawn, and acolytes. With this, I officially lose interest in the Star Wars franchise; even back in 1983, when I thought Star Wars was over, I couldn’t find any hunger for the comics or the “expanded universe” novels or any of the other things Lucasfilm devised to keep the brand a going concern until George Lucas revisited the saga sixteen years later. So the multimedia Joseph Campbell rewrite will have to chug along without me.  This last go-round neither disappointed nor thrilled me; it just exists. There’s always something going on, and that’s part of the problem: there’s never not something going on, no pause for breath, no beauty or poetry. We ain’t got time for that now. The Final Order, a bunch of bad guys led by the Big Bad Guy, the resurgent Emperor Palpatine, plans to subjugate or destroy every planet everywhere. The Good Guys leap to the rescue — identity-crisis Jedi in training Rey (Daisy Ridley), rash pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega). Meanwhile, good-bad guy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) wants to save Rey from Palpatine. His deal is as tangled as ever.   Some thematic relevance could be teased out of the previous entries, The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017). The latter, which I consider the best of the new trilogy, dripped some poison into the ears of the faithful. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), like Achilles, renounced the heroic code; he literally tossed his lightsaber over his shoulder in disgust. Well, we’ll have none of that now, not with non-entity J.J. Abrams (who made the first of the sequel trilogy) at the helm. Abrams’ insight seems to be that the fans want endless lightsaber duels and shoot-outs and spacecraft looping around. Some of the action has a shoot-the-works electricity, but the special effects are as hectic, busy, and essentially insecure as anything in Lucas’ prequel trilogy. Abrams strains so hard not to lose our attention that, through sheer narrative vehemence, he loses it anyway.  There are some pleasures. I felt it would be churlish to try to make out the seams in Carrie Fisher’s performance — cobbled together from unused footage — as General Leia. I was grateful for however much the moviemakers could give me of her. Billy Dee Williams, as the returning Lando Calrissian, comes through with a suave turn that helps to remind us that acting was once possible in these things. (Adam Driver just about sprains himself trying to make something real out of Kylo Ren’s nightmares of conscience, but he did better under the tutelage of Rian Johnson, a real director, on The Last Jedi.) The young trinity of new stars sprint this way and that, hopping from world to world, in search of a McGuffin called “the wayfinder” that will lead them to the lair of Palpatine. This dark emperor is as boringly eeeeeevil as ever, and his connection to one of the heroes feels underdone, as if Abrams and his writers were wincing and hoping the parallels to a similar revelation in The Empire Strikes Back wouldn’t strike us as too blatant.  We’re frequently reminded of the stakes — this needs to happen or the bad guys will be very bad and everyone will die — yet the demands of fantasy on this budgetary level guarantee there are no real stakes. People die but come back one way or another; the total outcome is never in doubt. Here and there, a bit of business tugs at the old nostalgic feelings or packs a sidewise punch: Daisy Ridley’s teardrop falling on Carrie Fisher’s (or a double’s) shoulder; a droid, cowed by past abuse, who declines a human’s touch with a prim but slightly panicked “No, thank you.” Even old Luke returns as a force ghost, reassuring Rey and us that he was wrong and it’s important for good to stand up to evil. That point is made here in the most generic of ways; it doesn’t risk resonating with the world we live in, which even Lucas’ goofball prequels at least tried to do. That much-derided “deathstick” bit in Attack of the Clones, for instance, at least tried to engage with human frailty outside the franchise, albeit in a laughable dad way. Nothing like that here.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 15, 2020"," It truly was a long time ago and a galaxy far, far away when ‘Star Wars’ was seen as not much more than a risky venture doomed to box office failure. But, in 1977, Fox executives thought just that. Director George Lucas, seen as someone who was rebelling against the traditional modes of Hollywood film-making, had made a homage to the cheap and cheerful ‘Flash Gordon’ serials with an overwrought space opera that would surely be laughing. The only people laughing would be Lucas and his accountants as ‘Star Wars’ caught the public imagination and the films and its two sequels became the biggest hits of the early 80s. By the time of the ‘Prequel Trilogy’ in 1999, Lucas was no longer a Hollywood rebel. He was a member of the establishment, the head of a franchise that had made a huge impact on popular culture and had spawned numerous ancillary products such as cartoon shows, books, video games and much more. The prequel trilogy would often be critically derided but were still huge money-makers and solidified ‘Star Wars’ status as one of the dominant franchises in cinema. By the time the ‘final’ sequel trilogy rolled around, circumstances had changed again. Lucas was shut out, having sold up to Disney. He often complaining that Disney were no longer taking on board any of his ideas, in the manner a divorced dad frustrated he has no say in how his child does their homework. ‘Star Wars’ was now the property of perhaps the biggest media conglomerate in the world and now, alongside Marvel, the symbol of dominance within not only Hollywood cinema but also within mainstream pop culture. ‘Star Wars Episode IX – The Rise Of Skywalker’ is ostensibly meant to represent an end to the narrative that Lucas began in 1977. Yet, whilst it is undoubtedly a farewell to the plots and characters introduced all those years ago, the film is also a reflection of the modern film industry that it has helped to create with all the excess and disregard for individual artistic expression that one has come to associate with the modern era. The end result is less a film and more a series of moments strung together to please a cabal of corporate overlords. The warning signs are apparent from the very first few seconds in the film’s opening crawl, the now de rigeur block of text that allows the film to begin ‘in media res’. ‘The Dead Live!!!’ it proclaims with such a disregard for any sort of semblance of credibility that it so resembles a Donald Trump tweet that you half-expect it to finish with an epithet of ‘sad’. Instead it and the following five minute opening of the film are a massive dump of exposition that reveals that Emperor Palpatine is alive and is back to terrorise the galaxy and is now asking Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to find Rey (Daisy Ridley) and kill her. There’s been no narrative seeding throughout the previous two films that have prepared for this moment, no hints that his character survived, the fact of which also undermines much of the ending of ‘Return Of The Jedi’. With a hand-waving moment in which various bits about cloning and ‘dark magic’ are uttered, the ultimate reason he’s brought back is, well, ‘because’. It’s not the last time in the film where you can swear you hear the incessant interference of executives humming throughout the background. ‘He’s a recognisable character – let’s bring him back. Doesn’t matter why. Fans know who he is.’ There’s a constant need to satiate an audience with nostalgia, such as the appearance of Billy Dee Williams as original trilogy character Lando Calrissian in another move that seems to amount to a shoulder shrug of ‘why not?’ and flashy visual effects than make any attempt to create something narratively cohesive. Indeed, much of the movie can be boiled down to a series of tedious exposition moments and then sending the characters to search for a MacGuffin which seems nothing more than a reason to keep the screen time up and give the characters something to do until the inevitable climax. Indeed, one of the major points of the movie is the quest for the ‘Wayfinder’, basically a magic compass that will allow them to find the Emperor. After much flitting around the galaxy and through the ruins of the Death Star, in another moment that screams ‘…look, nostalgic moment! Now stop thinking anything critical…’, it’s destroyed. Luckily, Rey finds another one in about five minutes rendering the previous hour pretty much pointless. The film’s lazy trading on nostalgia bleeds into the constant threat of killing of some of the known characters. It never does, it would be a much more interesting film if it did, and just gives an air of cheap emotion. Chewbacca is seemingly blown up, and brought back within two minutes. C-3P0 is given a moment of sacrifice which is immediately played for laughs and then reversed a little while later. Princess Leia’s demise is handled as well as it could be considering Carrie Fisher’s sad death in 2016. But even the scenes in which she appears, filmed some years previously, are awkwardly edited and her final moments are more shaped by the tragedy of real life than any attempt to make it work on a narrative level. The film so desperately wants to be a conclusion and to have some sort of closure. But we know that there’ll be a world of spin-offs and stories to be continued in cinema, on TV and in a litany of other media. So the film ends up in a sort of limbo land where there is no sense of consequence or meaning. Everything has to happen so the rest of the ‘Star Wars’ universe can continue to happen as well. You can bet a moment in which the protagonists meet a group of Stormtrooper deserters, which again is thrown away in a few lines, is being developed as a future film/TV show/video game/comic as we speak. There is no time to explore or reflect. Let’s just move on. With any form of narrative consequence effectively neutered, the characters are given nowhere to really go. While Kylo Ren (actor Adam Driver) and Rey (actress Daisy Ridley’ are given something of a character arc, mainly thanks to the first two films in the trilogy, their performances are still rather one note. Ridley is stoic to the point of being dislikeable while Driver’s conflicted villain still drifts towards the realm of ‘idiot manbaby’ though his ability as an actor just about stops it from tipping over the edge. Everyone else is given little to work with. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron just jumps around being roguish, John Boyega’s Finn is given little to do apart from look troubled while Rose Tico (actress Kelly Marie Tran), one of the more interesting characters from the previous instalment, is given around one minute’s worth of screen time. The irony is that on a technical level, JJ Abrams has a steady hand when it comes to catering for the needs of a blockbuster and when it comes to all the requisite whizzes and bangs, the film delivers on a visceral level. From the fleet of world-killing star destroyers to the final battle, which includes space horses, on one level a homage to the elements of the western including in the original film and, on another, almost a satirical bone thrown to the constant need to ‘one up’ previous instalments, it all delivers. But everything that hangs around is so threadbare, so unsatisfying that it feels hollow. Laurence Boyce is a film journalist who likes Bond, Batman and Doctor Who (just to prove the things he enjoys things that don't just start with a 'B'). He is also a film programmer for various film festivals in the UK and abroad. It’s too bad you can’t enjoy a great movie because of your need to have everything be logical. I believe in the importance of everything being logical in the real world such as politics (logical and truth being the opposite of Trump). But in a movie I just want to suspend belief and just enjoy the fantasy. I loved seeing all the dead come beach to life. And yes, I often similed and thought “what the fuc”, but it was so much fun that logic be damned. I not a Star Wars fanatic and I loved some of the previous Star Wars movies and was disappointed but still enjoyed others. But I was wowed but Rise of Skywalker and thought it was the best movie I’ve see in a long time. I hope your bad review won’t keep anyone who enjoys fantasy SI FI from watching this movie. I had low expectations and put off watching Rise for a while and was surprised at what a great way to end a great story. Absolutely loved it.

"Feb 24, 2020"," Whether you’re standing in the theater lobby or curled up in bed, deciding what to watch next is often the most difficult part of any pop-culture junkie’s day. And with dozens of films in theaters on any given weekend, plus virtually endless layers of streaming purgatory to sort through in search of your next binge-watch, there’s more out there—and tougher decisions to make—than ever. Fortune’s here to help you navigate the week’s latest offerings, boiling all the entertainment out there down into three distinct recommendations: should you see it, stream it, or skip it? Find out below. What you have to understand about Cats is that it’s certifiably insane, from its Jellicle whiskers to the tip of its Jellice tail. I’m referring here to the beloved Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, one of Broadway’s longest-running, as much as Tom Hooper’s gleefully demented movie adaptation. From day one, Cats has been one of the strangest megahits in any storytelling medium; it’s necessary to know this, and accept this, before reading any further.  Describing the plot of Cats makes you feel like you’re on bath salts (though not as much as does seeing it play out on screen), but the broad strokes are essentially this. Over the course of one night in an unnamed, eerily empty neighborhood, a group of cats take turns introducing one another—with names like Rum Tum Tugger and Mr. Mistoffeelees—as they debate which one of them will get to die, ascending to another plane of existence known as the Heaviside Layer, where they’ll be reborn into a new life. As a story, it’s pure fever dream, the kind of thing even Roald Dahl’s editor wouldn’t have let him get away with; but the strange non-plot of Cats functions, in a theatrical setting, as an ideal delivery system for visual splendor and powerhouse vocals. Hooper’s tackled musicals before, notably in 2012’s Les Miserables, where he spent 158 minutes on extreme close-ups of France’s most impoverished, and he fully throws himself into the task of translating Cats, a much more experimental piece of work, to the screen. There’s a newly created audience surrogate, Victoria (newcomer Francesca Hayward), who’s tossed via burlap sack into the neighborhood of the Jellicles, a tribe of cats on the eve of making their “Jellicle choice.” Across the sung-through story, she meets a mewling menagerie of contenders for said choice, including bumbling Jennyanydots (Rebel Wilson), stately Gus the Theatre Cat (Ian McKellen), and portly Bustopher Jones (James Corden), plus the aforementioned Mistoffeelees (a gawky Laurie Davidson), and Rum Tum Tugger (Jason Derulo, who sings and simpers gamely but seems to be missing a little something). Presiding over all is Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench and, no, I don’t know who named these cats), who’ll enjoy the festivities then select the lucky (?) feline in question.  The real draw of Cats involves seeing the all-star cast, which also includes pop sovereign Taylor Swift and vocal legend Jennifer Hudson (who gets to belt out “Memory,” the production’s lone showstopper), made over with the help of CG effects, called “digital fur technology” (though it’s basically just expensive deepfakery), into cat-human hybrids. The effect is deeply upsetting; though the actors are covered in fur and sporting twitchy tails, their proportions are still human, so the actors appear discomfitingly sensual while dancing and serenading one another. They have cat ears, but also human teeth; whiskers, but also fingernails. Some wear jumpsuits, while others go for a more paw-naturel look; the movie directs attention to the strange sense of faux-nudity that results by having Idris Elba’s villainous Macavity wear a hat and fur coat (which begs questions we shouldn’t dare to ask) but later make a surprise scene entrance after disrobing, to which the other cats react with a fairly hypocritical degree of horror.  In watching this digital fur extravaganza at work, entranced by the sheer scale of its visual chaos, I found myself wondering what else Hooper and his team could have done. The tactic most employed by Disney, the imperial overlord Universal’s bravely going up against with this freaky little musical (note this week’s skip it), has been to pursue photorealism in its animated productions. Earlier this year, it turned The Lion King into an uncanny-valley catastrophe, sapping the story of all emotional and dramatic resonance in the process. People simply did not want to hear human voices coming out of the mouths of Planet Earth lions, which is very understandable. Hooper’s techniques with Cats, through which his furry creations sing and dance maniacally into their versions of heaven or hell, bring the whole affair closer to Gaspar Noe’s Climax by way of The Aristocats. While Cats is by no means going to be a guaranteed hit with the little ones, who may be terrified by it or confused by its sexuality, it’s an absolutely unhinged piece of blockbuster filmmaking, worth beholding in all its tawdry, queer, bombastic glory.  It’s the kind of risk studios just don’t take any more, perhaps much more of one than executives ever intended it to be. The film cost some $100 million to pull off, and the amount of uncertainty Cats brings with it into the multiplex—did those oh-my-god-they-actually-did-it trailers turn people off, or the opposite?—makes it the most exciting box-office curiosity left in the calendar year. Will it break records or bomb? The experience of watching Cats—howls of stunned laughter from many, with a few Swifties cheering her grand entrance and the majority of us struggling to even once pick our jaws up off the floor—is one of the most strange and mind-melting you’re likely to have in a theater when it comes to studio content of this size and scope. I’d recommend going for much for the same reason the play’s stuck around so long—whether it’s a masterpiece or one of the worst things you’ve ever seen, it’s resolutely its own thing, a deranged freak-fantasia worth falling into for a couple of hours, if just to say you did. That is to say, it’s Cats. Netflix’s latest original-series gamble is aiming for Game of Thrones-level complexity in its sketching of a dark-fantasy realm where mythical creatures lie in wait but monarchal power struggles loom just as large.  And based on its first season, The Witcher (adapted from the beloved book series by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski) is well on its way. Comprising eight episodes, a smaller number which clearly allowed showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich to focus on thoughtfully tracing an ambitious array of story arcs, the series hangs around the impossibly broad shoulders of Geralt of Rivia (Henry Cavill, great at veining these strong-and-silent types with a gallows humor).  Further detailing the epic, sweeping nature of The Witcher‘s story would be to deprive audiences of unexpected, rather graceful reveals that the scripts tease out in due time. What there is to say about The Witcher is that it represents one of Netflix’s most fully formed forays into genre territory yet. The fights, especially in a cinematic and sprawling pilot, are of a kinetic and impressively top-shelf variety, Cavill’s Geralt moving like a man possessed as he rends flesh from bone and engages in some surprisingly balletic bouts of swordplay. And the production design is similarly well-executed, quickly establishing the Continent as a grungy, bloody landscape for these characters to navigate. But it’s the strength of the storytelling that bodes most well for The Witcher as a new destination for those done licking their wounds after that fateful final run in Westeros.  “If this mission fails, it was all for nothing,” characters tell one another throughout Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. That’s popcorn-prose concentrate, the kind of dramatic hyperbole that Star Wars has been coasting on since the very beginning. And while it’s traditionally been a fake-out—there’s always another mission, another battle to be won, even after ones that end with your hero encased in carbonite—such sentiment has never felt as profoundly hollowed out as it does by the end of Rise of Skywalker, a graceless franchise finale about nothing more than missions succeeding that itself feels like a staggering failure of vision, conceptually as well as on basic storytelling fronts. Director J.J. Abrams’ anxiety in making Rise of Skywalker surely fell along those same all-or-nothing lines. By his own admission, he’s bad at endings, and there was tremendous pressure riding on Abrams to bring home the story of the Skywalker clan, a nine-movie saga that’s never loomed larger in the pop cultural imagination. The Rise of Skywalker may well be the last Star Wars movie to feature the heroes Abrams helped forge in his nostalgic The Force Awakens—Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac)—and it’s almost certain to be the final outing for original cast members the series is now starting to outlive. Carrie Fisher died after shooting her scenes for The Last Jedi, and this entry (once intended to be Leia’s movie in the sense that The Force Awakens was Han’s and The Last Jedi was Luke’s) is to be her last screen credit. This just makes the magnitude of Abrams’s failure all the more devastating. One last adventure? Hardly. In a pivotal entry for the franchise, he chooses not to tell a story, instead drowning the developments this trilogy’s second film put forward in a soupy mess of fan service and stilted, unoriginal plotting. When The Last Jedi hit theaters two years ago, it offered a thematic depth hitherto unseen in Star Wars movies; in the hands of writer-director Rian Johnson, it tangled head-on with questions of hero worship and inheritance that have always been intrinsic to the galaxy far, far away. But the answers it provided—that one must relinquish the past to chart a future, that our heroes will disappoint us, that the Force is not the lineage of a select but a spiritual energy belonging to all of us—were bold and unexpected. In this, it was a shocking follow-up to The Force Awakens, Abrams’ play-the-hits remake of A New Hope, and ruffled feathers with a small but loud contingent of fans, who disliked the film’s treatment of Luke and focus on supporting characters (the most hated of whom, perhaps not coincidentally given the way these Internet mobs tend to go, were women and minorities).  This is worth mentioning because The Rise of Skywalker feels, more than a film, like a feature-length capitulation to those who disliked what The Last Jedi did with the Star Wars mythos (which was, at the end of the day, to make a real movie with it). Where The Last Jedi zagged, Rise of Skywalker zigs, choppily, back inside the pre-existing template to which Disney and Lucasfilm clearly now believes these movies must adhere. It is in fact comical how frantically it rushes to undo Johnson’s progression of these characters, crowding them unnaturally into the same space to combat criticisms everyone spent too much time apart in the last film and entirely sidelining Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran, the series’ first Asian-American lead who was brutally harassed online after The Last Jedi) with so little explanation it feels just as racist and sexist as the chatroom vitriol she was subjected to. The Rise of Skywalker also works overtime to retcon The Last Jedi‘s biggest twists. One deformed bad guy with Force powers is down for the count? Let’s introduce another. The question of Rey’s parentage got answered, unexpectedly, with the revelation her family name didn’t have to matter so much? Well, let’s revisit that actually. That’s truly the order of business in The Rise of Skywalker. It’s a movie slavishly devoted to hitting beats from previous films without basic narrative sense, to the point where it feels less like a natural ending to this franchise and more like bad fanfiction. The only way the characters progress is through ill-advised romantic pairings. One interminable (and ultimately pointless) lightsaber battle takes place amid in the wreckage of a destroyed Death Star. The finale involves outgunned resistance fighters making one last stand to blow up a massive bad-guy space base. Beloved characters are imperiled constantly, but there are no real stakes when even the already-dead ones are back for sizable roles. Familiar desert planets pop up, along with Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), for maximum fan pandering. There’s a real difference between a director and an artist, and nothing demonstrates this better than the massive step down The Rise of Skywalker takes both thematically and visually after The Last Jedi. There’s little by way of distinctive or striking visuals; the entire film is hued a murky blue, with an ill-advised focus on strobe lighting. Furthermore, it’s a Star Wars movie with absolutely nothing under its surface, which is a damning trait for a movie in this franchise. Abrams is a great producer, but his weaknesses as a filmmaker have never been this exposed. In attempting to give a noxious portion of the Star Wars fanbase what they asked for, his finale feels like a cheap and derivative product, the ultimate end-result of Disney’s written-by-committee modus operandi, so craven about resurrecting Star Wars that it comes off like grave-robbing. This is Star Wars broken under the weight of its own importance, eating its own tail for lack of any original voices to better nourish it. It’s nothing short of a tragedy. —Why these high-profile book adaptations bombed at the box office in 2019—’Tis the season for holiday movies—and Hallmark and Lifetime aren’t afraid of Netflix—Whistleblower cinema is back in a big way—How some artists are building their careers through Spotify playlists—As 2019 draws to a close, does the movie star still have a pulse?Follow Fortune on Flipboard to stay up-to-date on the latest news and analysis. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited.

"Jan 20, 2020"," So I’m a little late with this review, it’s been really hard to find the time, but with copious amounts of notes from the night I watched it combined with a couple of weeks to let everything settle means this will probably be a bit more calm and gathered than my immediately post-cinema review of Episode VIII from two years ago. Episode IX was, well, exactly what I feared: more JJ Abrams sticking far too rigidly to the original trilogy. It wasn’t without good moments, but it wasn’t a great follow up to the interesting ground work done beforehand… let’s take a closer look! The core trio of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are now a fully-fledged friend group, and all play off of each other well. An exchange where Poe is outed as a former Spice Runner, only for him to point out that he’s talking to a former Storm  Trooper and an ex-scavenger made me laugh, and generally they have great chemistry, which is good because they’re joined at the hip for most of the film. C3P0 (Anthony Daniels) is also with them for a lot of this, and for the first time since Empire, is actually really funny, with everyone generally ignoring him and treating him like crap. Sounds harsh, but it works! Then C3P0 has his memory wiped in order for everyone to access information to the Emperor’s whereabouts and that also leads to a lot of funny lines. He gets his memory restored later in the film, which is a bit of a cop out, but fine. Nothing major. The other standout is once again Adam Driver’s Supreme Leader Kylo Ren / Ben Solo. Ignoring that all his character development of becoming his own man and freeing himself of the past being abandoned by having him immediately serve under the Emperor and reforge his Darth Vader-like helmet, he has some great scenes. In particular the big fight with Rey, where he is wounded but healed by the young Jedi after he was distracted by hearing his mother’s voice, leading to a hallucination conversation with his father, revealing that he never quite got over killing him. Kylo Ren finally discards his dark self and becomes Ben Solo, and at the end even has some light-hearted moments as he takes out his former allies and helps Rey. While I didn’t like the idea of bringing him back, and it certainly seems like it was solely because Mr. Abrams didn’t know how to finish a Star Wars story without a dark overlord character, Ian McDiarmid was undeniably still great fun as the over-the-top scenery-chewing Emperor. The utter over-evilness of some of his scenes did put a smile on my face, even if in the back of my mind I was wondering if they’d ever actually bother to explain how he came back to life (they didn’t…) Other characters, like Poe’s old friend in a cool helmet Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and the returning Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) fill out a really fun cast. As for moments? Well, there are some good teases here and there. On Tatooine-like-planet #400, Rey and Kylo both try and pull an escaping ship, which ends up with Rey exhibiting Force Lightning, which was a good moment, and the aforementioned final fight between Rey and Ren on the ruins of the Death Star II was also good. During the final fight between Rey and Kylo against the Emperor there is a moment where all hope seems lost before Lando arrives with a large armada of rebel vessels, which was a very cool moment and well scored to make it feel like a real triumphant moment. So close to release there were no good shots of the Emperor, so this’ll have to do. He’s sitting in the chair to the left, honest! The rebels are assaulting a group of weapons that can destroy planets, but need to wait for a ground team to destroy a radar before they can destroy them. During this time our lead protagonist is facing off with the Emperor, but is losing and is being told to join the Dark Side as the only way to save her allies in the space battle. Soon the ground team is successful and the rebels begin taking down the weapons as the Emperor is eventually killed thanks to the help of our protagonist’s former enemy, who although he ends up dead, is redeemed for his evil deeds in death. The weapons destroyed and the Emperor defeated, loads of planets around the galaxy celebrate. Replace “weapons” with “weapon” and “her allies” with “his allies” and that’s a description of the end to Return of the Jedi. I mean bringing back the Emperor and undoing Kylo’s character development was one thing, but JJ really couldn’t come up with something even slightly new for an ending? Speaking of undoing development, it’s revealed that Rey is actually, somehow, Emperor Palpatine’s granddaughter, and Kylo’s revelation of Rey being a nobody from Episode VIII was still true because “her parent’s pretended to be nobodies to protect her”. So the refreshing “you don’t have to come from one of the previous families to be special” message was erased and replaced with “things tied to the original trilogy are cool.” Great. At the last moments of the film Rey adopts the surname Skywalker, so even that name isn’t gone, the “end of the Skywalker saga” could well still result in Skywalkers in future films (even if they won’t be related by blood to Luke, Anakin et al.) Speaking of Chewbacca, the final scene included him receiving a medal like the one he infamously didn’t receive at the end of the first movie, and while that got a chuckle out of me, it also immediately pulled me out of the film. Why would Leia wait until she was dead to give it to him? She wouldn’t, and in fact in the expanded media she didn’t. It was written to pop long-time fans without a single thought as to whether it would make sense or not, which is the wrong way to do “fanwank”… much like most of this film. Lastly, The Emperor reveals a massive armada of Star Destroyers, all manned with people loyal to him and the ways of the Sith, multiplying the First Order by thousands-fold, and still JJ Abrams had to add in that the new fleet are armed with planet-destroying super-weapons. Come on! The massive new fleet of ships and hundreds and thousands of new troops was threat enough, there was no need to add in a scene where one of these new Star Destroyers wipe out a planet. I went to a BJ’s right afterwards. The meal was disappointingly mediocre, just like the movie. That said, I did like the scene where Harrison Ford cameos. It was a genuine surprise, and quite moving.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 16, 2020"," In the ninth installment of the Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker, Rey, the most recent hero, and Kylo Ren, who is both Rey’s nemesis and soul mate, transfer lightsabers in a crucial battle. Many small moments throughout the film have paved the way, materially and spiritually, for this sleight of hand, and when it happens it is both obvious and breathtaking. It is an exhilarating vision of what could have been in an alternate universe. For a moment, we see that this moment of alliance is not the result of bloodlines and superior genetics, or of there being born heroes and born villains, but the product of subtle, free human choices. For a moment, the film appears to see beyond the tired tropes and family dramas it has so relentlessly pursued. The moment doesn’t last. The Rise of Skywalker picks up where The Last Jedi left off: Kylo Ren, son of Leia and Han Solo, nephew of Luke Skywalker, and grandson of Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader, has killed his way to the position of Supreme Leader of the imperial First Order. Rey, who shares a mysterious bond with Kylo that allows them to communicate across time and space, is trying to complete her Jedi training and race Kylo to the hidden planet of the Sith. As in all Star Wars movies, a small band of poorly resourced resistance fighters tries to defeat the imperial power against crushing odds and threats of impossible weapons. As Rey and her comrades zip across the galaxy, they meet new allies and many, many old characters, who show up for final goodbyes. They outwit foes, attempt daring rescues, and face near-certain destruction with witty dialogue and sincere camaraderie. They are a compelling band of friends with whom to face the end of the world. But the real focus of the movie is the relationship between Rey and Kylo. This article is available to Christian Century magazine subscribers only.

"Jan 13, 2020"," So here we are, 42 years and nine films into the official Star Wars “Skywalker Saga” that began in May of 1977 with the release of George Lucas’s original Star Wars (or Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope, if you want to be thorough). At the time, Lucas was so unsure of his film’s chances for success that he went to Hawaii on opening weekend so he wouldn’t have to be around if and when it bombed (it was during that Hawaiian trip, that Lucas and Steven Spielberg, who was there escaping his own woes during the post-production of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, cooked up the idea for Indiana Jones, but that’s another story …). How wrong he turned out to be. You would have to go back to Thomas Edison declaring that motion pictures, which he helped innovate, would be a passing fancy that lasted 10 years at best to find a more misguided movie predication. As we all know now, the original trilogy, which included Stars Wars, The Empire Strikes Back (1980), and Return of the Jedi (1983), turned into a cultural juggernaut that forever changed the movie industry (and its ancillary markets); in a sense, we are still watching movies in the house that Star Wars built. Lucas returned to the franchise he created in the late 1990s and early 2000s with a trilogy of prequels (1999’s The Phantom Menace, 2002’s Attack of the Clones, and 2005’s Revenge of the Sith) that charted the path of He-Who-Would-Become-Darth-Vader; it was a stew of mixed results, although hindsight has shown that Lucas’s consistency of vision across those three films was both admirable and challenging. That consistency is precisely what the third trilogy of Star Wars films, which began with J.J. Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) and was followed by Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), lacks. The Force Awakens kicked things off in grand style by introducing an entirely new cast of characters—Daisy Ridley’s Rey, a resolute orphan with a Jedi future; John Boyega’s Finn, a rebellious Storm Trooper who joins the Resistance against the fascistic First Order; Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron, an ace Resistance pilot and owner of BB-8, a rolly-polly new droid; and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, a conflicted Sith lord who yearns to be the next Darth Vader—while also bringing back familiar faces three decades older, notably Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Carrie Fisher’s Leia Organa, who we learned gave birth of Kylo Ren. Much of the new Star Wars world was successfully established, although some critics (and fans) griped that it looked and felt a bit too much like the old world.  No matter—narratives were launched, characters created, and long-term mysteries established, particularly the tantalizing question of Rey’s lineage. Those questions were deepened—and in some ways conflicted—in Johnson’s The Last Jedi, which divided fans right down the middle. Johnson’s take on the material, particularly the return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), wasn’t to everyone’s liking (although I remain mystified as to why some decried it as the worst film in the series), so there has been great expectation that Abrams, in returning to the directing chair, would essentially “right” that film’s “wrongs.” The very fact that this would need to be done speaks to the lack of planning that went into this trilogy, which now viewed as a whole has a kind of awkward, slip-shod feel; the individual parts are all good in their own ways, but the series comes together only under obvious pressure and stress. Almost anything can be forced to fit together, but don’t look too closely at the seams. With The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (working from a story concocted by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, the latter of whom was originally slated to direct) have delivered something that certainly passes for a fitting conclusion. There has been some griping about “fan service,” suggesting that Abrams is just kowtowing to Star Wars fans, which is basically the opposite of what Johnson did two years ago in taking the series in his own, idiosyncratic direction. That kind of criticism strikes me as absurd, since Abrams’s intentions are largely irrelevant and what matters is whether The Rise of Skywalker works both on its own as a film and as the capstone of the third trilogy in the Star Wars saga. On both counts, I would argue that it does. Imperfectly, sure, but it works. The first half hour is definitely the roughest, as we lurch from plot point to plot point in such rushed fashion that it’s hard to digest much of anything, much less enjoy it. The film opens with a massive “reveal,” showing us in the first 10 minutes that the mastermind behind all the evil doings from the previous two films has been none other than Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who was also the evil mastermind behind all the evils doings in both of the previous trilogies (his villainous bona fides were secured in both creating the Galactic Empire and turning Anakin Skywalker into Darth Vader). When we last saw the Emperor at the end of Return of the Jedi (when Ronald Reagan was President, mind you), Vader had hurled him into a void in the middle of the new Death Star where he apparently exploded. That, alas, was not enough to take him out, and it appears that he has continued to exist, albeit in weak, skeletal form, biding his time until he can re-energize himself and take command of the First Order—with Kylo Ren’s assistance, of course. The reveal of the Emperor is supposed to be a big kick, but it doesn’t really work because no groundwork had been laid in the previous films. Abrams and company just drop him into the proceedings—Bam!—as a desperate ploy to fill in the necessary narrative gaps. Thankfully, the film is more interested in following the continued plight of Rey, who is well on her way to becoming a very powerful Jedi, and her conflicted relationship with Kylo Ren, with whom she has already done battle multiple times and with whom she now has a strong mental connection. Leia Organa’s role in the film was intended to be much larger before the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher, but she still has a notable presence that largely hides the fact that it is cobbled together from pre-existing footage from the first two films and digital effects. We get a few new characters, including a mysterious masked bounty hunter named Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) who has an intriguing history with Poe Dameron, as well as the return of some familiar faces, most notably Billy Dee Williams’s wry scoundrel Lando Calrissian, who once again commandeers the Millennium Falcon.  Like the first two films in the new trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker is fundamentally a nostalgia machine, drawing heavily on the iconography and narrative beats of the original trilogy but with just enough of twists that it feels relatively new. Abrams cannily stages one of the film’s climactic moments in the twisted remains of the Throne Room from Return of the Jedi’s second Death Star, which further underscores how Rey is the new Luke and Kylo Ren is the new Vader and the Emperor is … well … still the Emperor. Abrams doesn’t have Rian Johnson’s belligerent daring, and this film lacks some of the clever visual grandeur that The Last Jedi had in spades. Abrams is certainly going for broke, giving us a lightsaber duel on a precipice thrashed by massive waves, a tense desert showdown, and a horrorshow of Star Destroyers lined up in the sky and lit with bursts of lightning. These moments work in and of themselves, and Abrams manages to stitch them together with enough spit and determination that you feel like you’ve witnessed a real conclusion, even if we all know that this particular juggernaut is likely nowhere near its end.

"Jan 10, 2020"," There’s a moment in the middle of Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker when Rey is approached by a new droid. It takes a step back as she reaches her hand out, bringing her to the conclusion that it had been harmed before. “It’s all right,” she says. “You’re safe now.” She hits a button to essentially reboot it. It’s a moment that has no bearing on the story, except that it reflects entirely how J.J. Abrams views the Star Wars fandom, a collection of people who were hurt by The Last Jedi but are now in safe hands that understand them. This is how The Rise Of Skywalker feels. Safe. When The Force Awakens came out in 2015, that word was thrown around a lot. It had several familiar concepts: a planet-killing weapon, a nobody hero from a desert planet, a bad guy with a black helmet who speaks through an intercom. But even with the familiar, there was still a sense of innovation. You had a storm trooper with a conscience and a villain with a strong inner conflict. More than that, The Force Awakens felt like a movie about something. A new generation trying to figure out their place in a world that was so profoundly belonging to the old one.  Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker has none of that. It’s so often a retread of the old and familiar that it forgets to do anything of its own. In fact, it even reverts some of the brilliant subversions of The Last Jedi. It does so in a way that feels punitive, almost as if to change is an offensive notion for the biggest movie franchise in history. It even has problems on a basic level. The first half of the movie is so incredibly rushed that the characters are essentially racing to get from one point to the other. It works best when things slow down, but then it’s bogged down by set-up for the next scene.  It’s not so much that you can’t enjoy the movie. It’s still Star Wars. There are spaceships, lightsabers, villains, and heroes. It’s just that having seen how good Star Wars could be, it’s a shame that the finale to this saga is such a whimper. It feels like a knife that’s been used for too long, and now it’s just dull.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 9, 2020"," Kudos to J.J. Abrams for doing something extraordinary to Star Wars with his Rise of Skywalker: he has made me not care about it for the first time in my life. Look: I am the clichéd GenX Star Wars fan who was eight years old in the summer of 1977 when the first movie hit us all with the force of a supernova. I lined up as a teenager — the queue wrapped around the cinema; just a one-screener back in those pre-multiplex days — to find out what Return of the Jedi would bring us. I was there when the first Phantom Menace trailer debut broke the baby World Wide Web. I spent the summer of 1999 rewatching Episode I many many times and having endless (and still not resolved) philosophical discussions with other fans about just what, precisely, constituted the “phantom menace” and whether Qui-Gon was stupid and incompetent or wise but thwarted and what “bringing balance to the Force” would mean. I was so very primed, in 2015, for the third trilogy to bring the 40-year-long story of my geek existence to a conclusion. This myth has defined my entire pop-culture life, in so many ways: it has contributed to the patois of Generation X (“Use the Force”; “I dunno, I have a bad feeling about this”); it has shaped how we all think about movies now. Star Wars — the first movie but also the ongoing sprawling saga, with its videogames and cartoon TV series and all of it — has been the Ultimate Story in the same way that, say, Gone with the Wind or Casablanca, or Lawrence of Arabia or The Sound of Music, have been for earlier generations, except even more all-encompassing. The Star Wars machine has become The Movies. Star Wars is almost religion… almost literally. What I’m saying is: I love Star Wars and I very much own that love. I have lived that love. The saga is in my geek blood. And yet I watched The Rise of Skywalker and — throughout it and after it — could muster no reaction beyond a huge heaving sigh of I No Longer Have Any Fucks To Give Here. I don’t even want to argue about any of it anymore. I’m exhausted by all of it, and not in a good way. I am exhausted by the toxic fan reaction and by the ultimate pointlessness of it all. (I am not saying that arguing over fiction is pointless. I am saying that arguing over this particular story has been deliberately rendered pointless by those who have been telling it.) I’m kind of relieved that it’s over, actually, because it has stopped being fun. Worse, it has stopped being interesting. 
[It c]harts a path to a future that refuses to get mired in nostalgia. Yet all the ‘Star Wars’ notes are here, remixed into a glorious new arrangement.
 
[u]pend[ed] expectations, demythologize[d] the mythos, and [took] an iconic series in a bold new direction with a story full of humor, courage, and dazzling imagery.
 It seemed to me that this was the right approach for the first two movies of a new trilogy, a wrapup trilogy, to take: acknowledge the past and play with the tropes, but then move in a much-needed new direction. Finish this particular story but open up this universe and make room for it to expand into fresh vistas. I mean, that’s how you keep it going, right? That’s what you need to continue raking in big ol’ corporate profit, no? It’s a big fucking galaxy out there, isn’t it? Let’s explore it! But with The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams — director as well as one of four credited screenwriters — sucks it all back in upon itself. Nothing that happens here and none of the answers to the mysteries the previous films in this new trilogy posed are the least bit surprising or enlightening. The biggest narrative crimes of The Rise of Skywalker are the same ones as Solo: A Star Wars Story: everyone in the galaxy actually knows everyone we’ve met before. This big crazy wide universe is, in fact, really insular and really fucking small and incredibly familiar. Say what you will about George Lucas’s prequel trilogy — it certainly has its problems, to say the very least — but at least it showed us a vibrant, diverse galactic civilization. And yet Rise of Skywalker might as well be a soap opera set in a small village, for all the scope it has. It’s genuinely shocking how cramped this movie ends up feeling. Who is Rey (Daisy Ridley: Peter Rabbit, Murder on the Orient Express)? Whence comes her Force powers? From there? Really? *groan* Forget whatever space battles this movie wants to mount; forget everything else Rise of Skywalker could have been about: Abrams (Star Trek Into Darkness, Super 8) makes this movie about that question, and the answer is tedious as well as aimless. For all the endless callbacks to beats from the original Star Wars trilogy — just when you think Abrams is done referring to the old movies, he throws in an even more shameless reference — Rise barely seems interested in the spirit of the overall tale. In 1977, Star Wars was rebellious and antiestablishment in every way it could be, from its provenance as a scrappy little indie in a Hollywood that didn’t know what to make of it — it was damn near cinematic outsider art — to its protagonist, the lonely farmboy who dreamed of adventure and of a life anywhere but where he was. Last Jedi was imbued with that spirit: in its audacious suggestion that the Jedi were greatly in need of, at a minimum, a Reformation, or that maybe the faith’s time had come to die; in its celebration of the little people who win wars with their necessary slogging gruntwork and its rejection of showy one-man heroics. Last Jedi was anti status quo, was all about blowing up the metaphoric Death Star that is this movie machine. Its target — perhaps unwittingly, though I suspect not — was as much a hidebound fandom as the increasingly hidebound franchise it worshipped. And then J.J. Abrams comes back, here in Rise, with, “LOL, hell no!” and delivers multiple fuck-you reversals to what Rian Johnson did in his film. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac: X-Men: Apocalypse, Mojave) is back to being celebrated as a cheerfully reckless hothead. Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega: Pacific Rim: Uprising, Detroit) and maintenance engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) are completely sidelined, their brand of quiet power and everyday courage not required here, and certainly not deemed of any worth. (Rise brings in another token nonwhite nonmale in order to pretend it is Diverse, but mysterious low-tech warrior Jannah [Naomi Ackie: Lady Macbeth, Doctor Who] ends up with almost nothing to do, too.) It’s one thing — a depressing thing — to see that, obviously, there was never any unifying vision for this trilogy; no one mapped out even a sketch of a overarching plot for the three movies, and the grand story it tells is damn near incoherent because no one seems to have had any idea what it was going to be about. Way worse, though, is how, with The Rise of Skywalker — the film struggles to justify that title — Star Wars became the Empire, solidifying ideas about lineage and nobility (broadly defined) and destiny and heritage that, more than ever in today’s world, need to fucking die, when slavish adherence to dynasties and heritage are doing so much damage. Somehow I’m always shocked when anything considered science fiction or fantasy shows itself to be so lacking in imagination, and when its fans reward it for its narrowmindedness. I’m also never not disappointed. It’s clear now that whatever flight of fancy Star Wars once took me on, it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey. This saddens me, but there are plenty of other stories out there that will engage me as I need. In addition to what you pointed out, every single character (save Rey and Kylo) is a plot device. The whole story was slapped together while they were scripting, and it shows. It’s such a waste of Daisy Ridley’s talents (she deserved a strong finish for the franchise that gave her a career), as well as putting Oscar fucking Isaac in a leading role and not giving him much to do. I thought the ending was beautifully done, but everything else was a mess leading up to it. If Disney decides not to make more Star Wars films — I’d be just fine with that. George Lucas got crazier as the movies he made progressed into the new episodes, but everything he did was because he believed in it. Disney’s interest is in seeing how high they can build the pile of SW money.  The first clue was Disney trying to turn out a film every year; those three-year gaps between the Lucas films made you hungry for the next installment. Now, not so much…. Rian Johnson believed in the story he told, which makes it all the more angering how its edges were sanded off in this one.  Makes me wish I’d gone to see Knives Out instead. It’s funny, I agree with almost all of your specific points, but still enjoyed the hell out of this one. MaryAnn and I are the same age.  Maybe the magic and not being able to imagine NOT loving Star Wars are still working for me.  And maybe a little of it is the headcanon I invented for this movie that takes the little bit of Dark Side necromancy we see and just runs with it.  Still ending up at the same place, but with some much cooler bits in between. I was going to post much the same as what you said. I enjoyed The Rise of Skywalker — I saw it twice — but I agreed with almost all of the points MaryAnn made (which is the sign of a good critic — they provide insight even when you disagree). I’ve been a comics fan as long as I’ve been a Star Wars fan.  Back in the ’80s, DC did this thing called the “DC Challenge.” It was a 12-issue round robin story with randomly determined creative teams for each issue.  Each issue had to end with a cliffhanger that the next team had to deal with.  For instance, I remember one that left Aquaman stranded in the middle of the Sahara desert and minutes away from dying due to lack of water. The writer had to have something in mind for an escape from the cliffhanger, but the next writer didn’t know what it was, and might go off in a completely different direction. The whole thing was fun, if a little disjointed and unavoidably gimmicky.  But this was a minor comic book limited series.  Sure, DC hoped it would sell, but if it didn’t, it was just this fun little experiment that wouldn’t ruin the company or anything. How can you possibly arrive at the notion that a “DC Challenge” approach is in any way wise or appropriate for a multi-billion dollar franchise? I know, it’s utterly ridiculous.  JJ loves his little mystery boxes and allegedly had answers in mind all along but didn’t tell anyone.  That’s a terrible way to manage a franchise, and just like the mystery of “who is Cumberbatch playing in Star Trek,” the resolution is the most obvious and underwhelming thing imaginable. It’s so, so, so sloppy. If you’re going to kill off Chewbacca 45 minutes in, maybe make the audience think he’s dead for a good hour before he comes back in the third act. If you’re going to have Lando call a bunch of ships for a big, sweeping moment of support (that specific moment is done beautifully), maybe show him calling the ships. If you’re going to have Finn insist that he’s going to tell Rey something, HAVE HIM TELL HER THE THING. If you want Adam Driver to have a character arc, maybe give him actual lines and things to say- there’s only so much looks (and unwarranted kissing) can justify in the third act. As much as I disliked this movie (and I was never going to like Reylo or Rey Skywalker, Rey Palpatine could have been okay but was treated lazily, like everything else), I would have enjoyed seeing the three-hour cut that was rumored. Agreed with all of this.  I was so angry at the reveal of who Rey really is.  I loved all the weird directions TLJ took and I hate that JJ undid all of it.  I particularly agree with the idea of the Jedi needing a Reformation.  It’s one of the few things I defend in the prequels- I think the Jedi were deliberately presented as bloated and corrupt, and the three trilogies could have presented a cycle of fall and rebirth.  I was guessing Rey would found a successor to the Jedi called the Skywalkers, justifying the film’s title.  Also, I wanted more of Broom Boy and other nobodies to show up and play a role, but no go. There was one scene I really liked, and that was when they met the underground worm thing.  It felt very Doctor Who, with our hero seeing a great beast but being affectionate towards it and helping to heal its pain. C-3PO is not allowed to translate Sith language but he can if they reset his memory.  This is contrived and doesn’t make much sense, but from a story perspective it makes sense.  He’s one of only two characters who’s been with us for every movie, so his offering to essentially die for his friends was pretty touching.  But then later R2 restores his memory from a back-up file?  So what was the point of that?  It’s like JJ wasn’t satisfied with undoing TLJ, he had to retcon things that happened in the same movie? Is that right?  I know it had a gap in it, but I wasn’t sure how far back it went.  But if you’re right, then yeah, that says it all. I might be looking for slightly more than is really there in the text, but confirming it would require seeing it again, and that aint happening in a hurry. J.J. needs to stay away from venerated sci franchises. He’s done more damage to Star Wars and Star Trek, that I don’t know if those two franchises will ever recover. He has the lead touch. I really don’t think it’s as bad as all that.  I absolutely loved the new Treks (and as far as I remember, MaryAnn did too.  The first new SW film by JJ was great, the second SW made not by JJ was great.  This one wasn’t great, but one out of five isn’t a bad record. Yup, I’ve enjoyed the new *Trek*s, and I have the same relationship to *Trek* as I do to *Wars*: grew up with it, shaped my geekiness, etc. My issue with new installments in either franchise hasn’t been lack of Trekiness or Warsiness, but more basic storytelling issues. His early career in the 90’s is mostly schmaltzy and sentimental, although I remember Regarding Henry being a minor hit when I was a kid.  Joy Ride, Felicity, and Alias in the early 2000’s were his peak, then of course he made a truckload of money with Lost, which I know many people love.  After that, I don’t know what happened, maybe he was given too much creative control a la Lucas, maybe he ran out of ideas, but everything went south in a hurry. Good Science Fiction is about ideas and exploration, and he’s become incapable of building a world substantial enough to reward wandering through.  As your comment and this review state, he and Disney have sucked all the wonder out of entire universes and left once rich, juicy ideas shriveled and crumbling in the mud. I don’t want him to fail or succeed, I just want him to get better.  Now Cameron, for some reason, partially jealousy, I kinda want to see him fail spectacularly.  His failures have the potential to be overblown, campy fun, J.J.’s failures (and successes) are forgettable, shiny mush, like a bowl of cold oatmeal with candy sprinkles. Personally, I always thought the cinematic SW universe was in trouble long before Abrams came along and that blaming the failure of the SW series on Abrams is like pretending The Phantom Menace would have been a sci-fi classic if not for Jar-Jar Binks.  I’m glad my niece and nephew find something to like in the new movies but apart from that, I have not much to say about the matter apart from noting that I wish for MaryAnn’s sake that the last two movies were a lot better. Hollywood does not reward this, though. Or, at least, it thinks it doesn’t reward this until some dude (ALWAYS a dude, and a white dude, at that) bucks a trend that “inexplicably” makes a splash (see: 1977 George Lucas) has a hit that no one expected. And then said white dude is hailed as a visionary or whateverthefuck and… oh god I am so exhausted by it all. I didn’t like the last jedi, found it a bore to watch i must admit and didn’t like any of the male or female characters in it(luke, poe, rose and holdo especially). Not seen Rise of Skywalker yet, but i’m guessing as i mostly enjoyed force awakens, i’ll probably enjoy rise of skywalker more than you did.
Last jedi left such a sour taste in my mouth though, i skipped rise of skywalker because of it. You’re probably right that disliking TLJ makes you more likely to like this one.  I disagree with you strongly, but it’s nice to see someone express that opinion respectfully, without falling into sexism. Write  a better one… Let’s all see it.
Considering the hurdles faced in this finale,  two principles being the incredibly short schedule and the loss of a key actor even before production began, it simply could have been worse, but wasn’t and I’m grateful for that. I thought the Rey+Kylo scenes were watchable, and they had palpable chemistry.  Ren is largely culpable in the murder of millions sentient beings though, which undercuts some of the dramatic moments near the end quite a bit.  You have to admit Finn and Poe have arcs that go nowhere in this film, and the trilogy as a whole. You’re right though, making a movie is not an easy undertaking, and there were certainly many challenges involved in this particular installment and many different interest groups to appease. I’m happy you went in with low expectations and were pleasantly surprised – no need to challenge those who felt let down.  If someone eats a piece of pie you like and says, “meh, not so good,” it would be a little silly to angrily retort, “I’d like to see you open up your own restaurant and bake a better one!  It could have tasted way worse!”  You liked it, they didn’t.  MA has a personal connection to the series too, which makes her disappointment that much more heartbreaking. Which is to say: Fuck that guy that you are replying to, and fuck Hollywood. I KNOW movies, and I know what makes good movies, and what doesn’t, even if I have never made a small fortune in the process. You don’t have to agree with her review but if the main points of your counter-argument are “write a better one” and “it could have been worse,” you might want to consider writing a better review yourself. Not gonna lie, The Rise of Skywalker is to Return of the Jedi as The Force Awakens is to A New Hope, except RotJ wasn’t that great to begin with, so TRoS is commensurately worse. I was going to write that well, it could have been worse, but after considering for a long while, I realized I couldn’t think of any way it *could* have been worse. It passed the final episode of a trilogy of trilogies over to J.J. (“I’m not good with endings”) Abrams, instead of Rian Johnson, who was originally going to make episode nine until the whining fanbaby men writing ignorant screeds on the Internetz got Disney scared and they replaced him. It threw out and un-did all the wonderful stuff Rian Johnson had done in THE LAST JEDI, and gave us stupid fan service to placate the worst element of the fans.
It wasted a bunch of good actors, most notably Kelly Marie Tran, who I thought the best thing in THE LAST JEDI. It did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own Death Star cannon, making you wonder why in hell they’d bothered building Death Stars to hold those cannons in the first place. (It goes without saying that any time you find yourself considering logical points in a STAR WARS movie, you’re kinda fucked.) 1)  In the middle of the film, Kylo makes a pit stop at 69 Aftward, the 24 hour night club on his ship.  As he orders a cold one, he spots a mysterious female Twi’lek across the room and offers her a twirl on the dance floor when Hux cuts in with a smirk saying, “These tentacles are taken, why don’t you Ren back to your room Kyloser.”  They breakdance to the death, but it ends in a draw.  They lock eyes panting in exhaustion, go to Ren’s room and make out awkwardly, but it’s Disney so the penetration is implied offscreen. 2)  Near the end of the climactic battle, an army of Ewoks led by a fully shaved Wicket hang glide out of a wormhole and drop water balloons filled with purple egg nog on the heads on the storm troopers guarding the shield gen… er radio tower.  A force ghost of Anakin appears, the Jake Lloyd verson, and exclaims, “Now that was Pod Racing!”  The ghost then breaks out in a lively Jedi space shanty to celebrate their victory, and the remaining Storm Troopers, driven mad by the beauty of the song, take off their armour and put it on again upside down so that it looks like they’re all walking on their hands and waving their feet in the air.  Everyone tries not to look at Wicket’s smoothly, shaved body and fails.  “Are you an angel?  You’re Endorable!” exclaims Jake Lloyd Anakin.  The Force Ghost and Wicket embrace, then make out awkwardly while everyone around them slowly pretends to suddenly have somewhere to go.  It’s Disney, so you only see Wicket’s sideboob for a couple seconds, and his nipples are blurred out. 3)  After the credit roll, the camera pans up from the spot in the sand to a robotic foot, as it continues upwards, we see that the robotic legs are attached to the torsos of Darth Maul, Jar Jar Binks, and a badly burned Jyn Erso.  “At last meesa reveal ourselves to the Jedi, meesa have hope, revenge issa built on hope!”  the creature exclaims ominiously.  Rey and the the charred torso of Erso make out awkwardly while the Maul and Binks torsos play rock paper scissors to decide who gets Luke’s saber.  Baby Yoda and Baby Groot drive up in a gold plated sandcrawler wearing blinged out Geordi La Forge visors and begin rapping about blasters and slave girls, Jabba features, but his verse is subpar.   It’s Disney, so they play the clean radio edit. It’s bizarre that Disney would want to play it safe with this franchise, given that it was guaranteed to make money no matter what.  Why not swing for the fences? 
It did such silly things as making the hidden fleet of star destroyers each have its own Death Star cannon, making you wonder why in hell they’d bothered building Death Stars to hold those cannons in the first place.
 That doesn’t bother me at all.  After forty years, the technology has no doubt advanced, so I’m willing to accept that they just now managed to miniaturize the cannons enough to fit on a Star Destroyer.  It’s actually nice to see a sci-fi universe where technology isn’t frozen in whatever people thought “futuristic” meant in 1950’s pulp magazines. I’m grateful this new trilogy happened just for The Last Jedi. I love that movie so goddamn much. It ignited a passion I’d never previously felt for this series. I happily isolate it as a glorious one-off. Not being a Star Wars fan, the shocking awfulness of this movie can be shrugged off as another piece of Hollywood horseshit. It might as well be called “Star Wars Episode IX: Fuck Rian Johnson”. It really feels like this movie was made to placate fans who hated Last Jedi.  As soon as it was announced JJ was going to direct this, I adjusted expectations accordingly, down to zero. I just detest everything Abrams does. He has no artistic soul as a filmmaker. All of his shots are empty, existing only on the surface. Potentially engrossing moments happen but the second they’re over they disappear. I’ll go further: his movies are all sociopathic. There’s no emotion. There’s the appearance of emotion, but there’s nothing true behind it. All potentially engrossing moments happen quickly then pass without lingering or seeping in to the subconscious to be truly savoured. Every moment is like that. An astonishing image appears onscreen but it never actually becomes astonishing. It’s always taken away by inherent falseness, an embedded emptiness suffusing the entire film. And also by the lightspeed editing that ensures nothing stays on screen long enough to matter. Nothing feels earned or honest, nothing is real. There can be no time to be sincere as that would disrupt the momentum of emptiness. A genuinely moving cinematic experience becomes ‘real’ in the mind of the satisfied viewer. You can feel it. You know when it’s reached you on some deeper level. Nothing here came close to that. This is pod people film-making. The ultimate example of JJ Abrams’ deeply unpleasant cinematic sociopathy is still the destruction of the Republic by Starkiller Base in The Force Awakens. Five densely populated planets are destroyed in what is far and away the most monumental, devastating, cataclysmic, unimaginable mass-killing in the history of the universe, and literally five seconds later the movie forgets all about it. Hey fuck it. That’s over with. Next! I get that on one level this is all broad pulp sci-fi nonsense, but it still shocks me how that film made that into such a banal moment. Meanwhile, Paige Tico’s sacrifice in the opening of Last Jedi still makes me gasp and shiver with an intense emotional response. With less than two minutes of screentime and no dialogue, she’s a living breathing person who matters. I can’t say that about anything in Rise of Skywalker. Finally saw this film, and while my immediate experience was “enjoyment” thanks to my utter lack of expectations (funnily enough a general movie-going philosophy I adopted after going into The Phantom Menace with high hopes), you absolutely nail the lasting impact of the film:  Nothing. Like you say, every scene, every visual, every moment, every emotion, every idea, breezes by in a moment and vanishes, never to be concerned again.  There’s some things that happen which should have major ramifications but don’t because the movie doesn’t care.  Including, once again, destroying a planet.  Which isn’t a spoiler because it doesn’t matter at all; like I don’t think the protagonists even know it happened?  At least — and holy turds is this damning with faint praise — someone was like “Whoa!  The Republic was destroyed, that’s bad!” That’s a good point – in Force Awakens there’s at least some reaction to the planets blowing up. But in Rise, it just happens randomly, because it’s the sort of thing that’s supposed to happen in a Star Wars movie. It’s only there for the audiences’ benefit, not the characters, which ends up not benefiting the audience, because shallow fan service in place of a real dramatic story isn’t a foundation for anything meaningful. It’s clear now that whatever flight of fancy Star Wars once took me on, it is no longer interested in having me along on the journey. I’m with Stacy Livitsanis: I’m glad the new trilogy gave space for TLJ to exist as a fantastic one-off. It stands on its own both as a film and as much-needed commentary on both the franchise and its fans; and the film’s themes will continue to resonate, whether future storytellers fulfill or squander its promise. But I’ve pretty much given up hoping for a cohesive, satisfying narrative for the Star Wars universe as a whole, and will just have to enjoy whatever nuggets of gold emerge from the inevitable sea of mediocre or atrocious crap. Sturgeon’s Law and all that. I believe we actually ARE living through a time of quality Star Wars storytelling… it’s just that it’s all happening in The Mandalorian. Oh well. REALLY TRIVIAL SPOILERS AHEAD

This movie shows a number of women working for the First Order. These women have hardly any lines. My theory is that the First Order went on a huge recruiting drive, trying to add more women to the team, but they couldn’t find any women who were willing to sign up. So they came up with a plan. The First Order’s spies knew that the Resistance had made tremendous advances in artificial intelligence, and had developed extremely lifelike androids to fight on their behalf. So they conducted a raid on a Resistance base and stole as many female androids as they could find. They reprogrammed all of the androids to join the First Order. There was only one problem. The androids’ original programming didn’t allow them to speak the Sith language. No matter how much time the First Order technicians spent trying to solve the problem, they could never get the female androids to speak more than a sentence or two. So the women spend most of their time saying nothing at all. The other possibility, I suppose, is that J.J. Abrams and his team made very little effort to put interesting female characters onscreen, but it’s 2020, so surely he’s aware of the need for better representation in the movies. Luke’s ghost also keeps appearing to Rey, who continues to train to be a Jedi while also being overwhelmed with self-doubt. It seems that Kylo Ren telling her that she’s descended from dead nobodies has really messed-up her mind and sapped her confidence. But Rey’s stand-alone nature is also part of her strength. During a conversation with Leia, the general says: “You’re not like my father or my brother. You’re new. Whatever happens, remember the Force chose you Rey. Your story isn’t written by anyone else.” The beginning of the film very much picks up from The Last Jedi in that the First Order has cut off all communication between planets in order to suppress a rebellion inspired by Luke Skywalker’s stand off at the Battle of Crait. So the spark of the rebellion did work in this version of the movie. … Oh and Rose? Apparently front and center through the whole movie, which is a damn shame given that she’s completely sidelined in Rise of Skywalker … At the very end of the movie, Finn and Rose lead a group of Force Sensitive youth to a remote planet where Rey is waiting to train the next generation of Jedi. And yes, “Broom Boy” is one of them. [Rey tries] unsuccessfully to bring Kylo Ren back to the light, but he’s too far gone and in the end he is “extinguished.” This is honestly what many felt the crux of Episode IX should have been: the battle for Kylo Ren’s soul. Instead, Abrams and Co. decided to muddle everything up with this Palpatine nonsense, which is just unnecessary added external conflict that detracts from the emotional thrust of this trilogy. And it’s worse because it is more than fan-fic in the sense that it had a real chance of becoming a movie in a way that none of the “It might have made a better movie” fan-fics have.  Like, the studio literally paid someone to write it so that it could become the actual script of the actual movie, they just decided “nah”. So, doesn’t change anything about the merits of the final film just like a fan-fic, but frustratingly closer to a reality we could have inhabited. Kinda like the original script for that terrible Russel Crowe Robin Hood movie that was gonna make the Sheriff the protagonist.  Like they had gold in their hands and flushed it down the toilet.  That’s much worse than the idea of the sympathetic Sheriff simply existing. A important caveat to the relationships between Trevorrow’s and Abrams’s Ep IX scripts: Trevorrow was fired from the production 3 months before The Last Jedi premiered. Oh sure, there’s no guarantee that what looks promising on paper actually winds up being good onscreen. All I’m saying is that Trevorrow seemed to understand and go along with the story direction that Johnson was suggesting. He was “yes-and”-ing Johnson, as opposed to Abrams who just said “Nah, we’re gonna go back to my idea.” It means that the decision not to go with his script was not made in response to the reactions to The Last Jedi. It was deemed unsuable all on its own. However disappointing Abrams and Terrio’s script is, Trevorrow’s film would almost certainly been at least as disappointing in its own, unique ways. Which makes this whole “leaked script” business into a ridiculous exercise. One that, because this is still the early 21st century, is already morphing into a bunch #ReleaseTheTrevorrowCut nonsense.
.
And that’s assuming we take the authenticity of this script at face value, which, really? Consider, this is a production company that went to such lengths to keep the existence of a major character, in a highly anticipated and heavily promoted new show, under such wraps that Etsy sellers made more money selling merch of this character last year than did two of the most merchandising savvy companies in the world. But somehow a rejected script by the guy they fired leaked out? Pull the other one. I never said that it was. I *will* say that TROS feels like Abrams’ very personal response to TLJ taking the story in a direction he seems not to have wanted. But whether or not the Trevorrow script is real, it’s a story that feels more satisfying and makes more sense as a continuation and culmination of the themes and story elements that have come before. Trying to offer something positive, I just listened to an episode of a Star Wars podcast called Scavenger’s Hoard celebrating Rose Tico and what she stands for. Partway through the episode the hosts read several moving comments from people talking about how much Rose still inspires them, regardless of the insulting way Rise of Skywalker treated her. The embrace of hope and love and the rejection of cynicism and hate gave me a solid lift out of the numb state I was in after seeing Rise.  I glanced at your red dot and quick take before going to see the movie anyway, hoping it would be one of those cases where I disagreed with you, or where I kind of agreed but liked the movie anyway. 1)  Adam Driver and Daisey Ridley — but especially Adam — freaking carry this dead-cow of a movie.  The closest anything came to ‘working’ was their story and that’s 100% because of their acting chops adding depth that everything else on screen lacked.  No offense to any other actor; John Boyega did what he could with “Reeeeeeeey!” 2) Boy the last line of the movie ticked me off.  When she’s asked for the second time “Rey who?” and she pauses to think, then smiles, I was actually starting to feel a swell of emotion for what I felt had to be coming next:  “Just Rey.”  Same answer as before, but this time said not with insecurity and shame but confidence and acceptance, because it’s her found-family that matters and they aren’t signified by a family name.  But nooooope! I think you could find justification for the title without that, and no other changes to the movie.  At this point all the Skywalker line we know of are dead and the evil ones redeemed — ‘rise’ could mean to ascending to Jedi Heaven.  But whatever.  The main thing I hate about the line is how it reinforces the theme that your lineage is actually super-duper important and if yours sucks/is egregiously evil the best you can do is adopt a better one. Yup. The more I read about it, the more I really, really prefer the Trevorrow version that could have been: where Rey gets over her obsession with lineage and decides that “just Rey” is more than enough. “Our masters were wrong,” Rey said. “I will not deny my anger. I will not reject my love. I am the darkness and I am the light.” “You’re nothing. You’re no one,” Kylo responds. Rey then ignites her lightsaber and says “No one is no one” before running at him, and the battle continues. The line, according to Burnett, is a callback to earlier in the film when Rey is discussing her lineage with Poe and he explains that everyone is who they want to be. No one is no one. I can just imagine the line “No one is no one” resonating in the culture in a way that nothing in TROS really has. It would have been a rallying cry for anyone protesting all sorts of injustice, for anyone who felt marginalized, for insecure teens and unmoored adults… for everyone, no “Chosen One” status needed. It would have been brilliant. And a damn shame it was never allowed to happen.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 8, 2020",Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a good tentpole movie for the holiday season and a fun Star Wars movie that ends on a high.,POSITIVE
"Jan 8, 2020"," It’s a statement we’ve heard countless times before, but there’s no denying that Star Wars means so much to so many people. For generations, fans have eagerly awaited new instalments with passion and dedication, finding meaning in a simple story about space battles and mythical wizards created in the 70’s by George Lucas. Like many others, I grew up with the theatrical releases of the prequels and was introduced to the original trilogy by my parents at an early age. The announcement of a sequel trilogy came at a perfect time in my young adult life that had me excited and hopeful for the future.A Fandom DividedIt’s impossible to discuss Star Wars in 2019 without first acknowledging the fandom behind it. People have always had their own opinions about Star Wars, what it should be, what it represents, and ultimately these conversations have turned from constructive and passionate to downright toxic over recent years.After Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the fanbase was quite literally divided, and it appeared as though there was no nuance in opinion; you either thought it was the best Star Wars movie ever made, or you wholeheartedly believe Johnson ruined Star Wars (an opinion that was once used against the prequel trilogy).Quite frankly, the response to the film was embarrassing. Rian Johnson was constantly bombarded with personal attacks and threats of violence on Twitter, fans were petitioning to have Episode 8 remade, and during this time I was almost afraid to admit my status as a Star Wars fan. Whether or not you liked the film (personally, it is in my top 3) Johnson’s vision oozed with creativity, passion, and a determination to create a project within the framework of a domineering company with the hope of bringing something fresh to the saga.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the ninth and final instalment directed by J.J. Abrams, which ultimately serves as a poignant example of the ways artistic integrity and individual creativity are of little importance when compared to pleasing the masses. Even more so, it shows the lack of planning that Lucasfilm and Disney engaged in prior to the release of Episode 7, a deficit that has resulted in three films that feel disjointed and almost unrelated to one another.A Lack of VisionWhen we open on The Rise of Skywalker, Kylo Ren has taken the place of Snoke as Supreme Leader after a failed attempt at recruiting Rey in Episode 8, and the galaxy is now threatened (again) by the late Emperor Palpatine, who has featured in the marketing and promotional material of the film.

It’s impossible to discuss Star Wars in 2019 without first acknowledging the fandom behind it. People have always had their own opinions about Star Wars, what it should be, what it represents, and ultimately these conversations have turned from constructive and passionate to downright toxic over recent years. After Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the fanbase was quite literally divided, and it appeared as though there was no nuance in opinion; you either thought it was the best Star Wars movie ever made, or you wholeheartedly believe Johnson ruined Star Wars (an opinion that was once used against the prequel trilogy).Quite frankly, the response to the film was embarrassing. Rian Johnson was constantly bombarded with personal attacks and threats of violence on Twitter, fans were petitioning to have Episode 8 remade, and during this time I was almost afraid to admit my status as a Star Wars fan. Whether or not you liked the film (personally, it is in my top 3) Johnson’s vision oozed with creativity, passion, and a determination to create a project within the framework of a domineering company with the hope of bringing something fresh to the saga.source: Walt Disney Studios Motion PicturesUnfortunately, the same cannot be said for the ninth and final instalment directed by J.J. Abrams, which ultimately serves as a poignant example of the ways artistic integrity and individual creativity are of little importance when compared to pleasing the masses. Even more so, it shows the lack of planning that Lucasfilm and Disney engaged in prior to the release of Episode 7, a deficit that has resulted in three films that feel disjointed and almost unrelated to one another.A Lack of VisionWhen we open on The Rise of Skywalker, Kylo Ren has taken the place of Snoke as Supreme Leader after a failed attempt at recruiting Rey in Episode 8, and the galaxy is now threatened (again) by the late Emperor Palpatine, who has featured in the marketing and promotional material of the film.

"Jan 8, 2020"," Star Wars is my first movie memory. As a 5-year-old boy, I huddled with my mom in a London movie palace in December 1977, transfixed by the images flickering on the huge screen. But then came the Sand People, who, along with the movie’s overwhelming auditory experience, scared me enough that we had to leave early. Despite that frightening introduction to the franchise, I soon became a devotee. And though I’ve lost much of my original enthusiasm over the years – mostly thanks to the poor quality of The Phantom Menace and the endless parade of non-canon content – I was genuinely curious about the impending conclusion to the saga. Would it take the story in a direction that would satisfy both super fans and casual admirers? And more importantly, would it simply be a good film? While the jury is still out on that first question, the answer to the second is a resounding yes, at least in the mind of this casual fan, who, surprisingly, found himself tearing up once or twice. The effects are superb and the performances endearing, especially the four main actors from the three sequels (Daisy Ridley as Rey, Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, John Boyega as Finn and Oscar Isaac as Poe). Yes, the film is derivative, repetitive, overstuffed, frenetic and sometimes just plain ridiculous, but it’s also irresistible. Powerful entertainment on an enormous scale, it’s the most emotionally resonant Star Wars movie since Return of the Jedi in 1983. Directed by J.J. Abrams, from a script by Chris Terrio (Argo, Batman v Superman) and Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker needs no advance plot discussion. One should go in fresh and uninformed, so I recommend avoiding trailers and blogs that might reveal twists. Strangely, though, a major twist – which negates one of the central plot points of the original trilogy – is revealed essentially before the movie begins, by the famous scrolling text. I won’t divulge that here, suffice to say it is a rather jarring rewrite of Star Wars history and one that I was initially uncomfortable with, until I found myself on the same narrative wavelength as Abrams and allowed the spectacle to wash over me. And that’s what I suggest you do too. Take off your critic’s hat, set aside your fanboy phobias and stop projecting your own desires onto the franchise. Just enjoy the nostalgia. And there’s plenty of it, almost as if Abrams wanted to wipe away some of the less Star Warsy choices made by writer-director Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. But I don’t embrace this “battle of the writers” theory. On the contrary, I contend that the narrative pivots have served a purpose, despite the new film’s lack of originality. But there I go again, overthinking. Let go, we must. And if we do, we might discover the film’s surprising message of moral duality and ambiguity. Good and evil live in all of us in equal measure, Abrams seems to be saying. Palpatine and Skywalker are two sides of the same Republic Datary. “Confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi,” Luke reminds us. Well, we’ve learned a lot about destiny over the last 42 years: the destinies of the characters, the destiny of cinematic entertainment and our own personal paths. It’s been a memorable journey: fun, emotional, exhilarating, frequently disappointing, but ultimately satisfying. The Force has come full circle.",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020"," In the last weeks of 2019 the big studios generously served up two Christmas turkeys. Judging by the reviews I wasn’t the only person yawning through Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, or wondering how Tom Hooper’s weirdly sexualised Cats ever secured a G rating. Both films are self-conscious ‘blockbusters’ intended to appeal to a popular audience. Both are surprisingly incoherent. The Star Wars movie tries too slavishly to supply fans with everything they might want from a series finale – Oh please let it be over! – at the expense of plot and continuity. The makers of Cats rely so completely on costumes and CGI to distinguish the film from the stage version they seem to have forgotten the most basic principles of story-telling. The Star Wars franchise is a juggernaut that guarantees the new film will make hundreds of millions of dollars in profits regardless of the luke-warm reactions. Cats is a more tricky proposition as it seems to be struggling, even though the international success of The Lion King (AUD$777.8 million and counting) suggests there is a huge audience for movies based on hit musicals. Cats debuted in 1981 and would run for 21 years in the West End and 18 years on Broadway, making it one of the popular stage shows of all time. This is a slightly depressing statistic because the music is so bloody awful. The musical might be defined as a degraded, diluted form of opera, interbred with the instant hooks and cheap sentiment of pop. Nevertheless, the best musicals, such as West Side Story or Cabaret, are tremendously seductive. Stephen Sondheim is arguably the best of the musicalists, but if Andrew Lloyd Webber had stopped after Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), we might look back on him as a brilliant talent. Instead he has rolled on and on, churning out treacly, formulaic tunes that keep the cash registers ringing. Cats has one memorable song, aptly called Memory, a piece of C-grade Puccini meets Celine Dion. It’s hummable but utterly maudlin. The plot, borrowed along with the lyrics, from T.S.Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats (1939), is deceptively simple: a bunch of cats called the Jellicles get together for a big annual shindig. The highlight will be when one lucky cat gets to ascend to the “Heaviside Layer”, and start a new life. I say “deceptively” because it’s never made clear why the cats are “Jellicles”. Is it a name or some kind of category? Does it have any special meaning? Neither is it obvious why any cat would want to trade in its nine lives and “ascend” to the next world. Despite the relentless singing and dancing the entire party feels like the sacrificial rite of a primitive tribe. This impression is exacerbated by the way Hooper has clad his all-star cast (with the merciful exception of Judi Dench and Ian McKellen) in skin-hugging, lightly furred costumes that make them look virtually naked. Few porno films could boast so much squirming, fondling and leg-spreading. If you’ve ever dreamt of Rebel Wilson clad in a body suit, waving her extremities in the air, this is the movie for you. Or perhaps you’d prefer Idris Elba in skin-tight, buttock-grabbing leotards? After an hour of Cats I began to suspect the popcorn they fed us had been laced with a psychotropic drug. The only problem was that I wasn’t actually enjoying myself. When it comes to Star Wars there are legions of devoted fans who treat each installment as a religious experience, but even the die-hards must have been a little disappointed by J.J.Abrams’s not-so-grand finale. For viewers that haven’t followed the series with such close attention – and I confess to having seen no more than five out of nine installments of the “saga”, not counting the spin-offs  – there are no concessions. If you didn’t see the previous film, The Last Jedi (2018), you may find yourself struggling to remember who all these people are, and what they do. Abrams is so focused on addressing the rusted-on fans that he leaves the rest of us lost in space. This narrative complacency means The Rise of Skywalker fails as a stand-alone film, which cannot be the case for any successful sequel. For the viewer striving to figure out what’s going on, the action is remarkably uninvolving. All those fights with laser sabers, the inter-galactic space ship chases, and so on, feel like a pointless mishmash. When we pause for a little character development the dialogue is so pedestrian one begins to look forward to the next empty action sequence. As usual, the Wookiee gets all the best lines: “uugggh, errmmh”. The costumes, the funny-looking aliens, the claptrap about The Force and the Sith… it all feels so tired. And looks so plastic. It’s not just Carrie Fisher that returns from the dead via digital wizardry. Just about everyone who was ever retired from the saga gets to be briefly resurrected – which is presumably the way Abrams conveys ‘The Sense of an Ending’, to use a phrase made famous by literary critic, Frank Kermode. None of this will disturb the real Star Wars fanatics. The franchise has become a decadent, First World subculture that allows people to enjoy a little harmless fantasy at the price of switching off one’s brain and abandoning any sense of what makes a great movie. If an entire planet is destroyed by a ray beam (again), this is just a piece of fun. Très amusant! Martin Scorsese recently copped flak from the pop culture groupies for claiming that superhero movies and franchise films weren’t cinema. Of course these movies are cinema but they are a form of cinema in which any hint of artistry has been dissolved in a formula as corrosive as hydrochloric acid. Success at the box office has become a reliable indicator not of quality, but of industrial-grade cynicism. What’s most disturbing is the blind willingness of paying customers to keep frequenting and supporting these movies. Many of the fans will confess their disappointment in The Rise of Skywalker and Cats, but one suspects they’ll be back next weekend, shelling out for something just as bad.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 6, 2020"," In a way, Star Wars has ended again. But it’s never really going to end. The “finality” of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a joke; this film wasn’t even the last Star Wars adventure many fans saw in 2019, since The Mandalorian’s season finale trailed the movie’s release by a week. But Skywalker does wrap up the trilogy of new movies that were first announced when Disney bought Lucasfilm back in 2012. No further numbered “episode” movies that add onto George Lucas’ original nine-film arc are expected to materialize in the foreseeable future. This puts Star Wars in the unusual position of having drawn to a close three separate times, with three separate trilogies. Plenty of franchises have promised an ending, then continued anyway. But even at its most cynical, Star Wars isn’t exactly Friday the 13th in the 1980s, advertising a final installment, then releasing another sequel a year later. Though Star Wars has had multiple TV and movie spin-offs, with more on the way, the core of the series is those three trilogies, each separated by a decade or more, all of which were intended to tie up loose ends in their respective third installments: 1983’s Return of the Jedi, 2005’s Revenge of the Sith, and now The Rise of Skywalker. Few film sagas get this many cracks at designing a satisfying ending. There’s been a lot of debate, though, over exactly how detailed those designs have been. A lot of criticisms over The Rise of Skywalker focus on the new trilogy’s planning, or lack thereof. Co-writer and director J.J. Abrams kicked off the run with The Force Awakens, then ceded the middle installment, The Last Jedi, to writer-director Rian Johnson. With Skywalker, Abrams returns to the trilogy, and visibly scrambles to assemble payoffs, fan service, and callbacks to the Lucas-era films, all while offhandedly retconning Last Jedi. Truthfully, though, a lack of forethought has always been a hallmark of Star Wars trilogies. Some of the first three movies’ biggest plot points were famously not part of George Lucas’ original set of ideas. Return of the Jedi in particular feels like spirited vamping. It introduces inconsequential but fun new characters (the Ewoks; the denizens of Jabba the Hutt’s palace of sleaze), and eventually falls back on the opening film’s plot, assembling another fleet of spaceships for another attack on an even bigger Death Star — only this time, with the three main heroes occupied elsewhere. Years later, even with Lucas exercising even more control, the prequel trilogy picks up some story threads, but lets others drop. Sometimes, those dropped threads are productive: Revenge of the Sith has a singularity of purpose that the other two films in the prequel trilogy lack. Sometimes, they aren’t. (Did Lucas ever actually work out who clone-army-commissioner Sifo Dyas was, exactly?) The best-case scenario for the lack of an overarching plan is spectacular middle chapters like the original trilogy’s The Empire Strikes Back and the sequel trilogy’s The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson clearly took his inspiration from old Star Wars movies, and from what he’d been handed with The Force Awakens. But somehow, he crafted a story that feels fresher and more personal, and he boldly avoids ending on an obvious cliffhanger, in imitation of Empire. It’s no accident that at the moment, Empire and Last Jedi are the most critically beloved Star Wars movies after A New Hope. Neither of those middle films had to attend to the messy business of wrapping up and paying off a trilogy. Rise of Skywalker has to sort through that kind of messy business on an unprecedented level, since it’s also wrapping up a 40-year saga. Every Star Wars sequel or prequel has carried baggage from what came before, via mirrors, callbacks, and improbable familial connections. As the series has continued, the baggage has accumulated, giving Abrams the unenviable task of wrapping up his own movie, the full sequel trilogy, and the two previously ended trilogies all at once. But sometimes, that feels like a self-imposed sentence more than an audience mandate, as if the filmmakers are taking cues from the pseudo-finality of Avengers: Endgame. Abrams clearly aspires to both the speedy, crowd-pleasing adventure of Return of the Jedi (what Pauline Kael dismissed as a “fun machine” back in 1983) and to the sense of saga-defining inevitability that gives Revenge of the Sith its darker, more operatic momentum. Since Revenge of the Sith was already the Empire Strikes Back of the prequel trilogy, and Abrams also wants to continue with the characters he helped create in Force Awakens, this means Rise of Skywalker is essentially trying to function as all Star Wars sequels at once. Well, maybe not Attack of the Clones. (Although: that is the other Star Wars film with pivotally awkward romantic chemistry.) But yes, The Last Jedi is in there too. For all of the moments in Skywalker that can be read as walkbacks of Johnson’s work, there are plenty of times where Abrams attempts to honor that movie in the home stretch, however clumsily. The Force-fueled Skype sessions between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) remain integral to the story, and so does their uneasy emotional connection with the original-trilogy characters they each parallel — Leia in Rey’s case, Darth Vader in Kylo’s. And their connection to each other is also significantly emphasized and deepened in Last Jedi, to the point where Skywalker has to see it through and find an emotional ending to their arc. While Skywalker retcons Rey’s supposed lack of a fancy lineage, Abrams does try to retain some humbler origins by revealing that Finn (John Boyega) is Force-sensitive. He was a Stormtrooper in the past, but could possibly become a Jedi in the future. Whether he does or doesn’t, his building Force abilities make a strong argument that individuals’ choices matter more than their history. They also pay off Johnson’s Last Jedi idea that Force users can come from anywhere. So it’s not that Abrams seems determined to finish the saga without input from Last Jedi. He apparently just felt obligated to sequelize and tie up far more than just his immediate cinematic predecessor. Skywalker shares that problem with the other Star Wars finales, in different ways. Return of the Jedi plays off the first trilogy’s greatest hits, dealing with the fallout from Empire’s dramatic I-am-your-father revelation as it happily recreates the zip of the first film. Like Empire, it’s better-regarded now than it was upon release, benefitting from the way so many latter-day fans experienced the original trilogy as a single work, easier to watch and love as a cohesive whole than when doled out over the course of years. Revenge of the Sith reversed that trajectory, critically speaking. It got pretty great reviews in 2005, as it broadened the scope of the prequels to tie further into the original trilogy. But in the years since, it’s been recategorized as just another clunky Star Wars prequel, fodder for windbaggy video analysis on YouTube and the occasional fan defense. (This reputation sells all three prequels short; it’s especially unfair to Sith’s downbeat grandeur.) Rise of Skywalker refers to both of the previous trilogy wrap-ups, though the greatest hits of Return of the Jedi fittingly receive more attention from Hollywood’s most successful cover-band filmmaker. Abrams mirrors Return’s entire climax, with the hero facing off against Palpatine’s super-powered fascism, while her friends stage a dramatic siege on the bad guys’ mega-weapon. Sith gets quoted in part to hand-wave away a plot point also connected to Return of the Jedi: a repeated line from Sith about how “the dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities that some consider to be unnatural” is meant to explain how Palpatine continues to quasi-live even after he was chucked down the shaft of an exploding space station at the end of Episode VI. Skywalker mirrors Revenge of the Sith in another, subtler way. Sith opens with a large-scale rescue sequence, where Jedi partners Obi-wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker rescue Chancellor Palpatine (oops!) from the openly villainous General Grievous. Though much of the film heads inexorably toward tragedy, this passage is both a wonderfully sustained bit of swashbuckling action-adventure, and an oddly touching glimpse at the brotherly closeness between Obi-wan and Anakin. Rise of Skywalker echoes that breakneck-yet-bittersweet quality, sending Rey, Finn, and Poe on their only real on-screen adventure as a trio, racing through a fast-paced, banter-heavy first hour. Both Sith and Skywalker take fond last looks at their droid heroes. R2-D2 proves his mettle again in the opening section of Sith, a treat for longtime fans. C-3PO gets his biggest role since the original trilogy in Abrams’ new movie. C-3PO’s story in Episode IX has a meta dimension, reviving his fussy-nuisance shtick from the original trilogy (minus some of the bile) before requiring a reset of his memory in order to access a crucial bit of McGuffin-hunting information. Halfway through the movie, the cyclical adventures of the new Star Wars generation becomes all new to Threepio, who regards his friends with freshly rebooted eyes and renewed skepticism over their recklessness. At the same time, his pre-erasure willingness to sacrifice his memories for the greater good carries an unexpected poignancy, even if Abrams isn’t willing to commit to the idea. (It’s a lighter version of the new trilogy’s favorite overused trick: the fake-out pretend death. It also misses the opportunity to restore C-3PO’s wiped memory of the prequels!) Here and at several other key moments — the reclaimed Solo-ish gestures of a reformed Kylo Ren, say — Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio realize an inspired hybridization of Return of the Jedi’s chummy sense of fun and Sith’s heavier sense of series history. They acknowledge the formulaic pleasures of this space-serial adventure, as well as their characters’ willingness and desire to break free of old patterns. At its best, this lends Rise of Skywalker a prismatic effect. At its worst, the new movie searches for its own homegrown sense of inevitability, and comes up short. The solution to Rey’s Palpatine dilemma — how she can defeat this massive evil without becoming what she most fears and loathes — amounts to a massive hedge, a Jedi-inflected version of the old action-movie cliché of a hero killing in semi-passive self-defense. Though Return to Jedi retreated into the safety of hug-ready Ewoks, the cuddliest versions of Han and Leia, and another Death Star run, it also featured Luke Skywalker throwing down his lightsaber and rejecting hatred in the face of withered Sith evil. Rey rejects Palpatine by lending her lightsaber to Kylo for a few minutes, then re-acquiring it so she can use two lightsabers to push away Palpatine’s Force lightning. That ending converts emotional turmoil into physical mechanics. It’s no surprise that Rey defeats Palpatine, nor does it need to be. Not much that happens in Return of the Jedi or Revenge of the Sith is especially surprising — Empire and Last Jedi have to take the burden of creative surprises. But the Skywalker filmmakers seem to arrive at their own conclusion by process of elimination, where anything too far afield from previous movies has been crossed off a brainstormed list. To some degree, Skywalker seems self-aware about this. Abrams and Terrio know they’re evoking memories of earlier films and competing with them at the same time. Yet the retreads of Return of the Jedi and the self-referential “rhyming” of Revenge of the Sith both extend their reach further into the world outside of fantasy and fandom. Luke’s decisions in Return of the Jedi have some philosophical depth, and Sith is explicitly about a society complicit in its own descent into a fascist state. The newest finale gins up some resonance about the vigilance required to keep fascism from rising again, but it’s mostly secondhand, almost incidental.  Rise of Skywalker’s reverence for the past may be necessary in a way Abrams and company probably didn’t intend. They’re out to placate the fans, but instead, they may be helping to banish this saga, in this form, from movies. More than either previous series wrap-up, this finale has been made with a strong awareness that more big-screen Star Wars will eventually follow. To its credit, the film still feels conclusive. Revenge of the Sith ends with a lot of good guys dead, but the key characters from the original trilogy — Obi-wan, Yoda, Vader — had to survive. Return of the Jedi similarly ends with a lot of good guys surviving. But the sequel trilogy methodically kills off Han, Luke, and Leia in spite of their respective curtain calls, and manages not to feel too grim about it. Fusing the fun-machine exhaustion and mythic grandeur of the other trilogy-cappers turns Rise of Skywalker into a messy exorcism. It’s by turns delightful, muddled, cathartic, and frustrating, sometimes within the same scene. And what could be more post-1977 Star Wars than that? The series’ final shot, true to Skywalker’s everything-to-everyone nature, mashes up the final shot of Revenge of the Sith (itself an homage to the famous two-moon horizon of the first Star Wars) and a strong image from The Force Awakens, with a dash of the Force-ghost finale from Return of the Jedi. Blurring the iconography of Rey and BB-8 into that of their predecessors is simultaneously heartening and a little sad, like a blip from C-3PO’s erased, restored, imperfect memory. With three trilogies, a renewable fan base, and money to be made, Star Wars is always beginning again, and always ending again. In its imperfect way, Rise of Skywalker captures those endless endings perfectly. With the saga over, maybe the next chapter can find a way to end better.",POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020"," Starring: Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong'o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams. The Skywalker Saga comes to an end, nearly 42 years after it began, with the ninth and final episode in the main Star Wars series. The Rise of Skywalker banks on franchise nostalgia for a finale designed to please fans while playing it safe and suffering, perhaps, as a consequence. The film begins with the revelation that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) somehow survived the events of Return of the Jedi (1983) – presumably by jumping through a convenient loophole – and has now assembled a fleet of Star Destroyers to decimate the Resistance and establish a Final Order.  Rey (Daisy Ridley) – who has been training under the watchful eye of General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) – joins defected storm trooper Finn (John Boyega) and Commander Poe (Oscar Isaac) as well as Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), to find and stop Palpatine while continuing her tussle with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). But everything ends up feeling rushed, even though the movie has a nearly two and a half hour running time to handle all its storylines. There are parts that could have been written and presented more deftly, and unnecessary arcs – like C-3PO’s Sith text issues, for instance – that could have been exorcised altogether without losing anything from the story. Also, for a film with this much action and destruction, The Rise of Skywalker is oddly vacant and short on excitement and poignancy. The climactic battle isn’t as edge-of-the-seat exciting as it should be, while the rest of the proceeds lack impact, possibly because they lack permanence; several times the film presents a touching or powerful moment, and then, a few minutes later, promptly undoes that development. J. J. Abrams mostly chooses to bask in throwback nostalgia and brings back familiar faces without managing to do anything particularly interesting along the way. His competent but risk-averse approach keeps the film from going in an inventive direction. There are moments that feel contrived, and the script’s sharpness is often lacking, as is character development for intriguing players like Finn who aren’t used to their full potential. Carrie Fisher’s parts – put together using unseen footage fragments – leave you wishing we could have seen the movie that would’ve been made if she had still been alive. The choice of primary antagonist also has a significant impact on the rest of the series, and not necessarily in a positive way. That said, there is fun to be had in Episode IX, and there are many elements of this action-packed finale that fans will enjoy. But the sequel trilogy, on the whole, feels a bit mismanaged.  The Rise of Skywalker ultimately leaves you with the feeling that things might have been more consistent and powerful if the three films were better planned, helmed by one filmmaker, and managed to strike a finer balance between creativity and fan service. Andrew Lloyd Webber’s long-running stage musical Cats makes its way to the big screen in the form of a bizarrely poor film, the pure awfulness of which simply boggles the mind. The musical basically shows anthropomorphic cats – or what are supposed to be cats but rather look like creepy pointy-eared humanoid extra-terrestrials – auditioning to be picked for the chance to … die and be reincarnated, I guess?  The plot – or what passes for a plot here – finds the Jellicle cats tribe introducing themselves via song and dance in the annual Jellicle Ball, hoping that their leader Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) will choose them as the one who gets to go to Heaviside Layer and be granted a new life, while the villainous Macavity (Idris Elba) plans to kidnap the other contestants so that he can win by default. What should be a delightfully quirky romp quickly turns into a nightmarish fever dream instead. The CGI descends to the depths of the uncanny valley.  The (almost non-existent) story is as incoherent as it is bonkers. The songs are unmemorable, the dance sequences badly shot. Cats may work on stage (although based on this cinematic atrocity, it’s hard to tell why the musical has been so popular), but onscreen, the whole project feels like a giant misuse of T. S. Eliot’s whimsical poetry.  The cast seems to comprise of actors who can’t sing and singers who can’t act. Stars are crammed into the film for no real reason (other than marketing?), including a glorified cameo by Taylor Swift (in a brief appearance as Bombalurina), who makes zero impact with a performance that would have gone unnoticed were it not for her fame. Rebel Wilson (who plays the lazy Jennyanydots) gets what is possibly the most poorly conceived sequence of the film. Judi Dench’s monologue at the end is bewildering. Meanwhile the overwrought Jennifer Hudson (who plays the ostracised Grizabella) seems to be in an entirely different movie altogether. Tom Hopper (who previously did an uneven job with Les Miserables) has basically delivered a case study in how not to make a movie. The fact that this CGI-drenched live-action version was made altogether is baffling in itself, seeing how the material is clearly better suited for an Aristocats-style animated adaptation. And the fact that they managed to mess up literally every aspect of the project is almost intriguing.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 3, 2020"," I run at warp speed up the escalator and across the lobby, open the door to the auditorium, and there's Luke, Han, Leia and Chewbacca, trapped in the trash compactor. It's the summer of 1977. In one of my first movie-going memories, my parents take my brother and me to Plaza Las Américas in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico, for a matinee showing of ""Star Wars."" Not ""A New Hope."" Not ""Episode IV."" Just plain ""Star Wars."" Walking into a movie at the halfway point was a common practice that, thankfully, has gone the way of Jabba the Hut, and so three years later, my brother and I made sure we saw ""The Empire Strikes Back"" from beginning to (traumatic) cliffhanger. I was upset at how much my beloved Rebels suffered, and even more upset I'd have to wait three more years to see how it all turned out. Of course, I came around on ""Empire,"" and even Mom came around on the Skywalker saga when we took her to see ""Return of the Jedi"" at the second-run Roosevelt, also in Hato Rey. Despite the modest nature of the bargain-priced theater, I still felt that tingle in my stomach, restless with anticipation as to what George L. was going to show me that day. In my case, for the second time. I felt some of that frisson of the unexpected two years ago when I saw ""The Last Jedi"" (aka Episode VIII), an unfairly maligned chapter (also a tad overpraised in some circles) that showed ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson taking risks that are all too rare in a franchise of this magnitude. So before delving into the many, many ways ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" the ninth and (ostensibly) final entry in this four-decades-in-the-making sci-fi epic, goes astonishingly wrong, let's begin with what it gets right. At heart, Lucas took aspects from John Ford's ""The Searchers,"" Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"" and the matinee serials he grew up on as points of departure for him and his screenwriting collaborators to tell a generations-spanning tale of a dysfunctional family that bears a resemblance to our own, despite being separated across vast chasms of space and time. It wasn't just the newness of the technology or the expertly staged action that kept drawing audiences to the theaters again and again. It's how Lucas and his team made us see ourselves in these characters, particularly when he turned the one who was initially portrayed as pure evil into a remorseful father. Despite that he was an extreme case of damaged goods, Dad discovered he still felt something for his children. Could that possibly be love? Director J.J. Abrams, returning to the director's chair after making ""The Force Awakens"" (aka Episode VII) understands this cornball sentiment is not something to shy away from but embrace wholeheartedly. But what's missing this time is a creative spark, the kind of overarching vision that weaved together the two prior trilogies, even Lucas' much-maligned prequels. Without that backbone mapping out how the events will unfold, it lays bare that the team behind ""Skywalker"" is making things up as they go along.  As a result, viewers invariably end up thinking more about the behind-the-scenes turmoil that has plagued the franchise since Disney bought Lucasfilm back in 2012 than whatever is happening onscreen. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" picks up some time after the events of ""The Last Jedi,"" which ended with the Resistance in tatters and the First Order, aka the fascistic regime born out of the embers of the Galactic Empire, hot on their tails and finalizing plans to snuff out those pesky Rebels once and for all. A shrewd director would incorporate aspects from both ""Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" striking a balance between the familiar comforts of the former and the bold departures of the latter. But Abrams, working from a screenplay credited to him and ""Argo"" scribe Chris Terrio, shows little to no interest in further developing the intriguing, politically minded strands Johnson cultivated in his imperfect but engrossing entry. A Jedi can come from anywhere, and the future of this galaxy rests on the oppressed masses ready to rise up against the soul-crushing overlords, ""Last Jedi"" posited with an eye on ensuring the series continued to evolve. In ""Rise of Skywalker,"" Abrams and Terrio react to these concepts with a collective ""that's nice, but no, thanks,"" reverting instead to the wall-to-wall fan service that hampered ""Force Awakens."" Abrams' heart is clearly in the right place, but he's supplanted the curiosity Johnson brought to the table with franchise fatigue.  Familiar faces and new characters once again fight for screen time, some amounting to little more than window dressing, as the central heroic trio of spunky Rey (Daisy Ridley), steadfast and loyal Finn (John Boyega), and raffish and brash Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) cross paths and square off against the brooding, tortured Kylo Ren (the ubiquitous Adam Driver), all while going on yet another scavenger hunt that is even more generic and forgettable than in previous installments. The big selling point here, already spoiled in trailers and TV spots, in addition to Carrie Fisher's final onscreen moments as General Leia, is the return of Emperor Palpatine, apparently reanimated from the ashes of previous script drafts. Once again played by Ian McDiarmid, the character has the potential to wrap its tendrils around this tired and stale cash cow to at least give it a sinister jolt, but Abrams and Terrio give him nothing to do but assume stock villain duties, leading to scenarios that feel like déja  vu all over again. (Richard E. Grant fares better at twirling his mustache as the ruthless General Pryde.) The real Frankenstein monster attempting to pull the strings turns out to be ""The Rise of Skywalker"" itself. The more it grafts aspects from its eight predecessors onto its frenetic, slapped-together narrative, the more impersonal it becomes. There are a couple of interesting ideas tossed around, like a heretofore unseen way of using warp speed, but they are abandoned as soon as they're introduced. You feel your goodwill eroding like the sands of Tatooine, well before a conclusion that feels at once preordained and undercooked. Even the chemistry between the younger actors feels halfhearted, their stabs at humor feeble. Most dispiriting of all, their quest for personal fulfillment is barely explored. Dameron's proclivities and Finn's separate (unrequited?) yearnings, in particular, are hinted at in timid, wholly unsatisfying ways before Abrams attempts to tie everything up in a bow without answering any vital questions. But as much as you may want ""The Rise of Skywalker"" to grow a pair and take ""Star Wars"" into the future, it remains irreparably stuck in the past. The resistance has been squashed by Disney's evil empire, it pains me to report, and no one is more crushed than my inner sci-fi/fantasy geek that this once influential, precedent-setting series has gotten lost in the firmament.

"Jan 3, 2020"," The ninth and final outing in this 42-year-long Star Wars saga is a step up from The Last Jedi two years ago but still a disappointment – but, then again, how could it not be?  With The Force Awakens writer, director and producer J.J. Abrams replacing The Last Jedi’s Rian Johnson (a public whipping-boy for that one, although it wasn’t that bad), this reunites the new characters, drags in some old familiar faces, ties up loose ends and builds, at length, to what should be one of the grandest finales in all American cinema. But it isn’t really. Even more dispiriting than the movie itself, however,
are the rabid legions of Star Wars fans out there – amongst the most
toxic in the world today – who’ll be screaming apoplectically about this until
the next, essentially unrelated movie comes along in a few years time. Don’t
you wish they’d all grow the Hell up? Without mentioning any spoilers, we open with Supreme
Leader of the First Order Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) travelling to discover the
origins of a mysterious voice he keeps on hearing. Ren, like Voldemort, Freddy
Kruger and Godzilla, simply won’t die, and Driver has trouble making him as
commanding as he really should be; he comes on less like a Shakespearean
villain and more a sullen teenager. Which Ren kind of is, actually. Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and
Chewbacca (now played by Joonas Suotamo) are off in the Millennium Falcon,
while Rey (Daisy Ridley) is Jedi-ing around as General Leia (Carrie Fisher)
contributes sagely advice. The late, great Fisher has been gone for three years
now and the role has been somewhat macabrely constructed here by way of unused
footage, soundbites and stand-ins, and therefore Leia feels disconnected from
the action. Abrams, as if feeling that her unreality must be acknowledged, even
has her say, “Nothing’s impossible.” Finn, Poe and Rey unite and set up a basic love
triangle, which will disappoint some LGBT audiences who hoped the guys might
have more of a bi-curious bromance, and a basic, call-back-heavy plot kicks in
as they venture forth alongside C-3PO (Anthony Daniels once again) to take on
Ren and his Dark-Side-ish types, which now include a sneering Richard E. Grant,
no less, as Allegiant General Pryde. And it all feels just a little
underwhelming, but John Williams’ done-to-death score swells to hopefully
convince you that you are indeed having an awesome experience, and Ridley, in
particular, acts her heart out. But, 42 years after the first Star Wars (or Episode
IV, or whatever), this can’t help but feel like a bit of a fizzer,
partially because of the fact that, back in 1977, no one had ever seen a movie
like Star Wars – and now we see them all the damn time, week in, week
out. And yes, they’re often better.",NEUTRAL
"Jan 3, 2020"," ""The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron's journey continues. With the power and knowledge of generations behind them, the final battle commences."" It’s all come down to this. Forty-two years of storytelling. A trilogy of trilogies. The end of the Skywalker Saga. JJ Abrams returned to the franchise following Colin Trevorrow's exit in a move that some considered to be safe – however, Abrams promised a newer, bold approach this time around. But, the big question is, did the movie deliver? The Rise of Skywalker certainly takes risks and ventures into some surprising places, but it all felt...rushed and slightly underwhelming. Maybe it was the huge expectations or probably the frantic pace and messy script that Abrams and Chris Terrio concocted but the movie never felt fully at ease with itself. Major plot points and characters were introduced without real explanation and, at times, contradicted themselves and established lore whilst other characters were sidelined almost entirely – the need to tie nine movies together and the existing elements from the sequel trilogy seemed almost too big of an ask at times. That said, The Rise of Skywalker is an awful lot of fun if you simply sit back and enjoy the spectacle – the spirit that made Star Wars so great is present here. The action scenes are excellent (there are plenty of lightsaber battles to enjoy), the VFX are a joy to look at and, funnily enough, that breakneck pace aids the narrative at times (especially early on, the opening fifteen-minute salvo is superb). Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley put in great performances in their final run-outs as Kylo Ren and Rey and the entire cast back them up with fine displays (the digitally-added Carrie Fisher just about feels right too). The good outweighs the bad, but the movies biggest flaw is in its returning villain (as heard in the trailers), it’s a huge addition that when all is said and done, complicates the previous movies and adds a video game-like quality to the conclusion of the movie. As a saga concluding effort, The Rise of Skywalker isn’t the roaring, perfect send-off we’d hoped for but it’s still a fun, sometimes exhilarating, adventure and helps to remind us why Star Wars will live on.",POSITIVE

"Jan 2, 2020"," Las altas expectativas generadas por el último capítulo de esta saga, que inició hace 42 años, se vieron derrumbadas después de los 143 minutos que dura la aventura intergaláctica de Star Wars. Episodio IX:El ascenso de Skywalker, ya que aunque el director J.J. Abrams y el guionista Chris Terrio apelaron a la nostalgia, al traer de nueva cuenta a personajes como el Emperador Palpatine, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker o Lando Calrissian, el filme jamás terminó de arrancar. Aunque resulta ser la cinta más corta de esta tercera trilogía, ubicada en la era de la Resistencia, lo realizado por Abrams se siente largo, cansado y por momentos sin concretar algo que pueda erizar la piel. Las batallas entre Rey y Kylo Ren, quienes podrían ser considerados los personajes que definirían el rumbo del capítulo, son de lo más simples y no provocan emoción. Si a esto se le suman algunos problemas de continuidad y lógica, como cuando Rey atraviesa un embravecido mar y llega seca a su destino, sin una gota de agua que le escurra, el resultado es poco alentador. Los fans de hueso colorado han defendido el episodio IX bajo el argumento de esa nostalgia perdida y por algunas sorpresas sobre los orígenes de Rey o cameos como el del compositor John Williams. Sin embargo, si se ve con mirada fría, este último capítulo es de lo peor de toda la saga. Una lástima para cerrar una historia que inició en una lejana galaxia ubicada en 1977.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 31, 2019"," After four years, the latest Star Wars trilogy is finally coming to an end. While the death of major characters were expected, some were still shocking and others were difficult to accept. However, the real-life passing of original franchise star Carrie Fisher hit everyone hard as it meant she would never see the end of the series to which she was such an important contributor. Yet, General Leia Organa would still play a major role in the final chapter as the latest Skywalker saga comes to an end in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Having regrouped after the devastating attack on their fleet, the Resistance is relying on information from an Imperial spy to determine their next move. However, obtaining the intelligence requires Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) to fly dangerous missions throughout the galaxy, barely evading the First Order’s army. In the meantime, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her Jedi training with Leia (Fisher), though she’s often distracted by the mysteries of her past and Kylo Ren’s (Adam Driver) intrusions. Kylo is on his own dark quest to become the universe’s ultimate ruler by eliminating any threats to his leadership, which includes convincing Rey to sit next to him on the Supreme Leader’s throne.  With Disney announcing Star Wars will be taking a theatrical break, this film has the added duty of definitively wrapping up the Skywalker saga for the foreseeable future. Consequently, it needs to give audiences closure, and give each of the characters viewers have come to know and love over the past few years a fitting send-off. While everyone may not be happy about some of the trajectories, it all makes sense and fulfills its mandate of allowing audiences to leave the theatre without unanswered questions. The film opens by catching up with each of the main characters, including two major action sequences as they try to complete some aspect of their mission. From a hyper-speed chase through the galaxy to a brutal ground battle that leaves the forest floor littered with casualties, the movie gets viewers’ hearts racing early on. With the final push by the First Order at hand, there are many more confrontations in this picture as everyone is on high alert and Resistance movement of any kind triggers a cavalry. Several new personalities are also introduced throughout the picture, including a tiny, adorable alien mechanic named Babu Frik and a new, talking droid friend for BB-8 called D-O. While romance has been a low priority when compared to winning the war, there’s certainly some sparks flying between certain characters, especially in this episode as friendships are deepened, relationships are rekindled and flirtations are realized — though they’ve never really gone in for traditional fairy tale endings. New characters, however, continue to expand the universe, viewers’ understanding of it and the key personalities as they grow with each encounter. While the plotlines aren’t really surprising, they’re not entirely predictable either. Some time before a major reveal, they begin dropping hints of what’s to come, which is a great way to engage discerning audiences while still delivering jaw-dropping reveals. There’s never going to be a way to make everyone happy — particularly when it comes to some character arcs and the marginalization of others — but this film does a pretty good job of giving the people what they want.

"Dec 31, 2019"," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC At the end of The Last Jedi, we witnessed Luke Skywalker sacrifice his life so the remnants of the Resistance could escape aboard the Millennium Falcon. This was after Kylo Ren promoted himself to supreme leader by killing the mysterious Snoke, and offering Rey a place at his side ruling the galaxy. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi made some bold choices compared to JJ Abrams’ fan service-y The Force Awakens. This created a rift between those fans that wanted a new drug and fans that wanted another hit off the Star Wars nostalgia bong. After director Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) was fired deep into pre-production on The Rise Of Skywalker, J.J. Abrams stepped into the breach to conclude the Skywalker trilogy he started. The Rise of Skywalker finds Kylo Ren teaming up with Emperor Palpatine, who we find out has been hiding out on a secret Sith planet, orchestrating his will through his puppet Snoke this whole time. He offers Ren the means to conquer the galaxy — an armada of planet destroying starships he calls The Final Order – but only if he kills Rey. So, begins a planet hopping cat and mouse McGuffin chase as Rey hopes to find an ancient Sith artifact that will lead her and the Resistance to Palpatine, with Kylo and the Knights of Ren hot on her trail. The Resistance only has a narrow window to launch their final all-or-nothing attack as The Final Order readies to leave the secret Sith world and destroy any planet that doesn’t fall into line. Skywalker is a dense watch, as Abrams attempts to mix info dumps, exposition and narrative to varying degrees of success and only makes sense if you’ve seen all the previous Star Wars films. The cast are all known quantities at this point with Driver being the clear standout this time around. Even with all of the changes, his is still the most consistent story arc throughout all three films as Ben Solo continues to be conflicted over which path to take. Carrie Fisher who had passed away before the end of production on The Last Jedi also posthumously returns in a leading role culled from unused footage from Jedi to help explain a major plot hole. It’s a noble gesture honestly, but it feels like fan service rather than a genuine path for Princess Leia Organa. The crux of this dense narrative is a string of reveals that work at the cost of coherence and continuity with everything that has come before. I hesitate to call it lazy writing, because I understand it was creative problem solving, an attempted solution to an unsolvable problem. J.J. Abrams wanted everyone to leave the theater happy.  But by doing so he lost the momentum, and cohesion that Johnson had handed off to him. He turned in a film that while generally okay at best, it feels like filmmaking by committee and focus group, rather than as singular vision driven by story. While I thoroughly enjoyed the further exploration of Rey and Kylo’s relationship, which is the emotional core of the film, I felt like Abrams kept getting distracted by spectacle, the need for big final reveals and lore rather than the humanity that drives these films.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 30, 2019"," So here we are… forty two years after the first ever Star Wars film opened in 1977, the final chapter of the Skywalker saga is released. There was a huge anticipation for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, naturally, given its place in the franchise history as the final conclusion. In preparation for this, my hubby and I saw Return of The Jedi the night before (and we actually saw Empire Strikes Back in October as part of MN Orchestra LIVE in concert series). When I finished watching the movie, I turned to my hubby and whispered, they might as well call this franchise SPOILER ALERT (highlight to read) ‘evil space grandpas’ If you’ve seen this movie, I think you know why. Just like what I did on The Force Awakens, this post is not a review per se, more of my random thoughts about the film and the franchise as a whole, so proceed with caution if you haven’t seen the movie yet. Unsurprisingly, I have a lot of the same quibbles with this one as the 2015 movie that JJ Abrams also directed… mainly the excessive amount of nostalgia, as some critics have rightly called ‘fan pandering,’ and lack of suspense throughout. Yes there are some fun moments, but the big moments are pretty much predictable. The key phrase ‘no one’s ever really gone’ uttered by Luke Skywalker at the end of The Last Jedi came up again in this movie. Beloved Carrie Fisher returns as General Leia Organa (via the use of repurposed unreleased footage), but she’s not the only one. In fact, the entire movie is basically a road trip of sort to find a supposedly dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) who now resides on the planet Exegol. Apparently he’s so NOT dead after all, in fact he’s been a puppet master to Snoke, Supreme Leader of The First Order. But before Rey, Poe and Fin could get to Exegol, they had to find a device called Sith Wayfinder. I feel like that plot is basically a way to reunite Rey & co. with yet another returning character Lando Calrissian. The crew looked practically giddy to be meeting Billy Dee Williams in that scene, and vice versa, that it took me out of the movie a bit. That’s what nostalgia does… while I enjoy seeing certain actors back in a certain franchise, it distracts me from the actual story that unfolds before me. Speaking of the story… there’s a lot of ‘more of the same’ in The Rise of the Skywalker. Interesting that there were some rumbles on the interweb that JJ Abrams was subtly dissing Rian Johnson‘s The Last Jedi, saying that it was “a story that I think needed a pendulum swing in one direction in order to swing in the other.” Now, whether Abrams was throwing shade at Johnson or not, the fact of the matter is, the two filmmakers didn’t seem to see eye to eye. As a more casual fan of Star Wars, I actually like the fact that Rian had the guts to do something different and subverting the franchise. Unfortunately I’m in the minority and because many die-hard fans hated what Rian did, so naturally he’s not invited back to helm this one. The biggest ‘twist’ of this movie is in regards to Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) identity. “People keep telling me they know me. No one does,” She quipped in frustration. But her reluctant ‘nemesis’ Kylo Ren claims he does, then he just said it blatantly who her parents really are. It’s supposed to be a gasp-inducing moment, but for some reason it was just ‘meh’… in fact, Rey’s similar lineage situation that bears such resemblance to Luke’s and Kylo’s feels like convenient (read: lazy) writing to me. The part I like most about Rey when she’s first introduced in The Force Awakens is that she’s just a scavenger with no Jedi blood in her, and that her parents are just ordinary people. In The Last Jedi, Kylo himself told her ‘You come from nothing. You’re nothing’ which undeniably made him even more furious that she could wield as much power as he does. Then the ending that film (the scene with the young boy) also hinted that there are other ‘ordinary’ people with no prominent lineage who could use the Force. I love that message that people are more than who they’re born to be and where they come from, that we do have the power to become more than what’s been imagined for us. So by making Rey as a Palpatine obviously undermined the storyline that’s been set before and render many other plot points meaningless. I don’t know in what other cinematic franchise is that ever a good thing?? I have to say that the nostalgic moments have different degrees of impact. I said I enjoyed seeing Leia and Lando, and the final arc of General Leia Organa is a memorable moment. But the now decrepit Palpatine is mostly eye-roll inducing (especially since the scene of Vader throwing him down the space abyss is still fresh in my mind). Not only would it seem impossible that he survived that fall, but just when did he have time to have a son who later becomes Rey’s dad?? On top of that, he’s also mighty enough to build an entire armada and hides ALL of them from every single creature until the opportune time dictated by the script to reveal it. I barely have time to ponder on that as there’s a ton of stuff going on in this movie… the crew frenetically jumped from place to place in search of that Wayfinder thing-y, which eventually leads to the main battle between Rey and Kylo. No doubt the lightsaber duel of two crucial characters, on top of the remains of the second Death Star no less, looks epic. With the waves and torrential rain, it’s an atmospheric scene to be sure.  It’s got some wow moments, but overall the scene just didn’t have as big an emotional impact as I thought it would. SPOILER ALERT (proceed with caution as I’ll mention key plot details below)
Since Force Awakens, I’ve grown to appreciate Adam Driver more and more (you could even say he’s my current cinematic crush), but I gotta say Kylo’s got the short end of the stick here in terms of his character. Yes he’s a Darth wannabe from the start, longing to be a powerful Sith leader like his grandpa, but this final movie just renders him into nothing more than a conflicted man-child. It pains me to see Driver, who’s so excellent in Marriage Story which I saw just two months prior, barely given much to do here than looking mostly dazed and discombobulated. Now, given how powerful Rey’s become, the outcome of the duel and what she did afterwards didn’t really surprise me. In a key moment in the movie, suddenly Han Solo turned up again… Was it a dream? A hallucination? Was Kylo delirious? Does it matter?? In another nostalgic scene, Harrison Ford revisited his most famous ad-lib in Empire Strikes Back as his prodigal son struggled to find the words to say … that part made me smile, but I find this dramatic scene more schmaltzy than genuinely moving. Still, Driver at least still has a compelling arc and a dignified resolution… gone is Kylo Ren’s toxic power-hungry machismo, in the end he’s Ben Solo after all, and he’s got an honorary ‘death’ as a Jedi. But where is Rose Tico?? The spunky mechanic with a big heart had a big role in The Last Jedi… Kelly Marie Tran was a great addition to the Resistance crew. But here she’s hugely sidelined for most of the movie while Fin is off doing his heroic duty with a new compatriot, Jannah, a Resistance sympathizer. Now, Naomi Ackie is fine in the role, but I can’t help missing Rose in the journey with the Resistance fighters. Now, after teasing us for four years whether Rey will finally turn to the dark side… well, the final answer is something so utterly predictable. Once again our heroine, just like the original hero of the saga, is facing a family member [yawn]. Rey matters because she’s part of an important, all-powerful family. It’s treading familiar [and familial] grounds the fact that bloodline and lineage is the key to achieving real power, that is the ability to use the Force. Perhaps the fact that we’ve seen all before, the action-packed battle of ‘all of the Sith’ VS ‘all of the Jedi’ barely holds a candle of the original battle between Luke vs Vader/Palpatine. It’s what follows that would likely be the talking points about Rise of Skywalker… yep, it’s all about Reylo. Not satisfied with just an epic battle of good vs evil, we’ve got to have some controversial romance thrown in. I wonder how the convo goes in the Writers Room… ‘hey wouldn’t it be surreal to have Vader’s grandson making out w/ Palpatine’s granddaughter?’ I supposed Kylo’s longing look every time he sees and ‘feels’ Rey from a distance (boy that came out SO creepy) has suggested he has feelings for her from the start. And who could forget that shirtless scene during a Force-bond in The Last Jedi that bothered Rey so much she asked him to put something on? But yet, I still wasn’t prepared for the kiss… it feels like it came out of nowhere. I mean all the mutual pull between the light and dark side that haunts both these poor souls is SO massive… it took so much out of them with huge stakes on both sides that you would think romance is the last thing on their minds. Naturally plenty of fans have always wanted to ship the two of them, as Reylo has been the subject of a plethora of fan-fiction, which makes the kiss feels obligatory. There’s been a lot of shared motifs in Star Wars and Shakespeare–we’ve seen the Romeo and Juliet plot between Anakin and Padmé before, so I guess their grandson is bound to share similar fate. All in all, The Rise of Skywalker is an enjoyable but also frustrating film. I was caught up in the rousing nostalgic moments and even felt emotionally moved by some of them, but as soon as the movie’s over, I was left with an overwhelming sense of meh. It’s not a bad movie per se… I mean the actors did a good job in their roles, production design & special effects are top notch, John Williams‘ music is obviously still iconic, even Abrams’ direction is enjoyable… but at the end of the day, Chris Terrio and Abrams’ script is serviceable at best. It proves that no film, no matter how beloved the franchise it, can simply ride on nostalgia alone. At the end of the day, as a film fan, we crave innovative storytelling that sparks one’s imagination… I don’t think JJ Abrams gave us that with this one. Honestly, after nine films, I’d be hard pressed to know just what the Force is supposed to be about since the franchise’s overall narrative is so discordant and inconsistent. Perhaps it’s a good thing this is the final installment of the cinematic Skywalker saga, but of course, with Disney+, no franchise is ever really gone. Especially one as lucrative as this one. Good read Ruth. I definitely liked it more than you it seems mainly because I felt several of the things that bothered you were actually good directions for the story. Take Rey coming from no one particularly special. That’s certainly a good message, but I much prefer the dramatic tension that comes with the revelation that she is a Palpatine.  Hi Keith! Interesting that you actually like the fact that she’s a Palpatine. You thought the revelation was dramatic? It felt like it was mentioned too casually by Kylo, which is odd too as he had said previously ‘she had come from nothing.’ I wonder when he actually learned about her actual identity.  I liked the Palpatine mainly because it goes well with the rest of the series. If you think about the Palpatine and Skywalker family tension is a throughline that starts in Episode 1 and runs to the end. As for Kylo, Palpatine reveals that he has been every voice in Kylo’s head. What Kylo believed about Rey’s parents was exactly what Palpatine wanted him to believe. I think he learned her real identity at the beginning when he and Palpatine made the pact. Out of the three films of this new trilogy, this one is my favorite but that doesn’t say much since I have issues with all of them. The problem with this new trilogy is that Disney wanted to get the new films out as fast as possible and by doing so, the films has no true identity or goal. They hired a bunch of writers to write each film and when The Last Jedi backfired on them, they hired JJ back to “fix” the issues with some of the fanboys and girls had with the last film. Of course this film now also divided the fans, some who loved The Last Jedi felt they were betrayed by what Johnson came up with and the people who hated that film didn’t care for the fans service that JJ did for this film. The original trilogy had one goal and that was to show that Luke is the a Jedi and he’s the “chosen” one and for the most part all three films delivered. As terrible as the prequels were, those films also has one goal and that was to show people how Anakin becoming Darth Vader. George Lucas was in charge of the story in all of those 6 films and Disney should have done the same with this new trilogy. Hire that one writer/producer to be in charge of the story with one goal to tell but instead they had tons of writers who all came up with their own version of the story. As I’ve said many times, when there’s too many cooks in the kitchen the food won’t taste good. Lol! Interesting that we each have a favorite of the new trilogy… mine is definitely The Last Jedi. I just love what Rian Johnson did and the new characters had an emotional arc. But even Abrams and Johnson realize they simply cannot please everyone.  I actually didn’t hate the prequels, there are scenes I appreciate though overall the writing is pretty bad. But yes, the prequels had a clear goal of introducing Vader, and man the last 15 minutes when we first saw Anakin became Vader was extremely memorable to me and quite emotional too. Of course the ‘too many cooks spoil the broth’ problem has always plagues many blockbuster franchises. That’s why it’s amazing what Kevin Feige did with the Marvel movies in tying them all so well together. I agree the nostalgia was excessive and at the expense of new ideas. A big problem is Disney didn’t map out the trilogy from that start. Star Wars writer said in Vanity Fair article Rise of Skywalker does not undo The Last Jedi, and in an EW piece the writer explains why Kelly Marie Tran had a reduced role. But they definitely messed up the progression from E8 to E9 for the viewer watching back-to-back, Kelly Marie Tran and the young boy at the end you mention are not relevant in E9. Hi ya Chris! I know that the filmmakers/writers were on the defensive in regards to many people’s complaints, but at the end of the day I don’t think they could really ‘defend’ a not-so-great movie that has little imagination. I mean I thought the ending that explains the title is perhaps the only ‘new idea’ they came up with. The more I think about Rey as a Palpatine the more I dislike the movie and it sort of lessen my appreciation for the character that had been built up pretty strongly in The Force Awakens. Hi Claratsi! I like TLJ the most as well, but interesting that you didn’t care for the characters in the new trilogy. It’s true isn’t it, compared to the trio of Luke, Leia and Han, these new characters just can’t hold a candle to them. As for the proper bad guy, poor Kylo is definitely a pathetic substitute. Even Ren, Snoke and Palpatine put together still can’t compare to how amazingly-memorable Vader was. Everything about him is just so iconic. I love your comment about Palpatine being ‘parachuted in,’ sooo true!! His entire scenes basically made me roll my eyes! All a desperate attempt to rescue a very average trilogy. Agreed re: Kylo but I did find myself strangely enjoying his arc more towards the end; a better hero than a villain 🤷‍♂️ shame he’d already killed his dad though the idiot! I think on reflection that was the moment at the beginning of this trilogy were I may have checked out! I doubt it was ever gonna recover in my eyes after that! But yeh, Snoke – what was the point!?  While I did enjoy the film, I do agree that the film did lack any real suspense and stakes.  TLJ had some flaws but at least was a step in the right direction as far as taking risks and wanting to explore many things.  What J.J. did was cater to the worst group of people who mainly have sand in their vaginas as they could never be satisfied.  Honestly, fuck those fans.  If they’re not happy, fuck ’em. Well in a way I’m glad that with the release of Rise of Skywalker, I think more people began to appreciate The Last Jedi. What Rian did was extraordinary and I liked his approach in subverting the franchise while still gave us what we love about Star Wars. Film is in my blood.

"Dec 30, 2019"," Como era de esperar, el estreno de ‘Star Wars: el ascenso de Skywalker’ (Rise of Skywalker, 2019) ha vuelto a crear un polvorín entre los fans y los no fans de la saga, pero especialmente entre los amantes de la anterior entrega y los que no le tienen mucho aprecio, dejando que la crítica haya sido no solo menos benevolente sino especialmente destructiva e insidiosa. Algo que contrasta, claro, con la reacción de los fans.  Y es que los fans, ese ente que cada uno que da su opinión convierte en su hydra particular, son los que están recibiendo, en realidad, la mayor parte de los palos, porque según muchos análisis son el elemento tóxico que ha convertido el Episodio IX en la película más discutida, odiada y peligrosa para la paz mundial del año. En realidad, lo que se puede observar, es la misma pataleta vehemente de siempre, ahora por parte de los que consideran la Star Wars de Rian Johnson una pieza magistral (sic). Antes de entrar en analizar por qué ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ es una gran película de aventuras espaciales, independientemente de lo que haga bien con respecto a la anterior o no, es conveniente hacer un cierto balance de por dónde van los tiros de las críticas al film de Abrams. Muchos apreciaron el valiente intento de Rian Johnson de expandir la saga y convertirla en un espectáculo más polivalente, con humor y unas supuestas rupturas con mandamientos de la saga que están más en la cabeza de algunos que en ninguna tabla de la ley. En el texto de arriba analizaba esto con profundidad, pero la idea principal es que muchos de sus avances tan solo eran exposiciones, no nada definitivo, y muchas de ellas han creado caminos en la cabeza diferentes a lo que realmente se muestra en pantalla. Por ello, las mayores críticas a ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ se centran en como “dinamita” todo lo que supuestamente dinamitó el VIII, pero siendo llevado a extremos en los que se reinterpretan o malinterpretan aspectos de ambas películas.  Abrams tenía varias ideas plantadas para la trilogía que la segunda no desarrolló. No significa que las decisiones tomadas en el segundo capítulo quisieran romper nada. Podían posicionarse, pero son nada definitivo. Por ejemplo, Ren queda como el líder supremo en la anterior, pero no significa que no estuviera planteado que había un mal mayor detrás. No es ninguna afrenta que aparezca Palpatine, y además no es el superior de Kylo Ren, sino una nueva némesis para él. Ren pretende seguir su misión, engañándole, pero los planes reales son unirse con Rey y derrocarle, no pasa a ser un súbdito, sino un enemigo activo que juega a dos bandas, dándole una mayor dimensión al personaje. Lo mismo pasa con Rey. El hecho de que Ren diga que sus padres no son nadie en el Episodio VIII no era definitivo. Por mucho que signifique que ella no es nadie, Ren lo dice casi como una revelación para el público, y eso, dentro del contexto del film hasta rechina. ¿Qué pasa por qué sus padres no sean nadie?  Se critica que no se haya dado ninguna pista, pero, entonces ¿Cómo iba a ser una sorpresa? Por otra parte, si Luke no quiere entrenarla no es porque “no sea nadie” precisamente. Él ve su potencial, él ve que ella tiene una tendencia al lado oscuro muy fuerte y una fuerza como ninguno de sus padawan. Lo que le hace temer que le pase de nuevo lo que a Kylo Ren. El hecho de que sea heredera de un Palpatine no sale de la nada. Cuando se ve a sí misma lo hace en un oscuro e inquietante laberinto de espejo. Hay apuntes claros en el Episodio VIII. La crítica a esta línea se hace absurda cuando, además, el misterio de su origen es la propia fuerza del personaje de Rey. Su conflicto, no iba a quedar resuelto en el segundo episodio, que es un nudo. Las implicaciones de que Rey fuera sensible a la fuerza era que cualquiera puede tenerla. El niño cogiendo la escoba dejaba esa vía abierta y ampliaba las posibilidades de Disney, por cierto, de hacer más películas sin los Skywalker.  Por lo que, ese cuestionamiento de Johnson, que no es tanto un “acto valiente” como un “movimiento comercial a largo plazo”, no queda anulado. La revelación de Rey no elimina esa idea de que cualquiera puede tener la fuerza. De hecho, Abrams tiene muy en cuenta la lección de la anterior y la aplica a un personaje cuyo conflicto había, literalmente, muerto con la caída de Phasma. Finn, un niño huérfano secuestrado para ser un soldado imperial se encuentra con otros como él mientras se da cuenta de que tuvo ese presentimiento gracias a… la fuerza.  Esta idea conecta con la idea de “los niños con escoba” del final de la de Johnson y al final son ellos el apoyo revolucionario que se dejaba entrever y, de hecho, se expande con el sometimiento de la primera orden en el planeta Kijimi y se refuerza con el personaje de Zorii Bliss. Además, esta idea inspirada por la muerte de Luke Skywalker es la que lleva a los rebeldes a hacer aliados por toda la galaxia en su escena final, por lo que no, el acto de Luke no fue en vano. En otros comentarios se critica que se recupere el aspecto honorable de la orden Jedi, tras dejar quemar el árbol y, de nuevo supuestamente, los libros sagrados. Es gracioso porque el propio Johnson deja la idea de que eso no es tan significativo ya que hay un plano al final del Episodio VIII, en el Halcón Milenario, en el que se muestra claramente un cajón en el que Rey ha cogido los volúmenes para completar su entrenamiento y seguir estudiando. Vamos, que el Episodio IX tan solo continúa la idea del entrenamiento que insinuaba la anterior. La idea de que Luke estuvo buscando a Dark Sidious también está en los libros que Johnson dejó como gancho, por lo que no se acaba de entender demasiado bien por qué se habla de que esto sale de la nada. Pero lo más extraño es que lo que decía Luke en el Episodio VIII sobre acabar con los Jedi se toma de forma literal, como si fuera el mantra de la película y no  consecuencia del tormentoso conflicto del personaje. Cuando Luke aparece como fantasma de la fuerza para agarrar el sable hay una respuesta poética a su desprecio de este en el anterior. Obviamente, cuando Luke se redime en el final de la de Johnson cambia su parecer. Cuando Luke decía que “los jedi tienen que morir” habla su parte amargada, con miedo —como bien indica ahora que se ha liberado— su parte que desprecia su sable láser. Pero esto cambia con su aparición final. En su holograma, empuña el sable láser azul (o se proyecta con él) que acompañó a su padre, y molesta a Ren por ser el de su abuelo, por lo que la imagen habla por sí sola.  Por ello, no tiene sentido que ahora siga despreciando la fuerza, los sables y el ser un Jedi después de superar su miedo y romper el muro a la fuerza que ha construido. Cuando ahora reconoce que es un arma noble, se lo dice a Rey con sorna paternal, usando el sentido del humor que define su personaje y haciendo énfasis en la desilusión especular de Rey en ese momento. La crítica a lo que hace no es una corrección de nada, sino que indica que muchos ni siquiera han entendido bien su doloroso y bello arco de caída y redención en el octavo capítulo. El síndrome de “ensayo y error” de Jar Jar Binks fue un caso muy sonado en el 99. En aquel momento nadie se quejó de que el terrible bicho desapareciera en la trilogía de Lucas, pero no se ha aceptado tan bien que Rose tenga tan poco protagonismo en esta entrega por la respuesta tan nociva contra la actriz que tuvo su inclusión en la segunda parte. El hecho de que Kelly Marie Tran tuviera que abandonar twitter es tan lamentable como los insultos racistas a Leslie Jones por ‘Cazafantasmas’ (2016). Pero si nos ceñimos al ámbito cinematográfico, la drástica reducción de tiempo en el tercer acto es lógica por la necesidad de centrar el capítulo en Rey-Ren y cerrar los arcos de Poe y Finn. Rose tiene relevancia en el segundo episodio porque es un personaje-vehículo para cambiar a Finn, cuyo plan es desertar. Rose no estaba escrita para tener otro desarrollo más que el de ser, nada menos, que segunda de mando de la rebelión junto a Leia. Que el capítulo se centre en Rey, Poe y Finn y los junte por primera vez es orgánico y lógico. Otro elemento cuestionado es el desfile de caras conocidas, apariciones y reminiscencias de otras películas de la saga. El agotador debate de cada entrega, que aquí está bastante justificado por cerrar una historia de nueve películas y atar muchos cabos al mismo tiempo de servir de despedida para muchos. Pero es que esas apariciones tienen sentido. El recuerdo de Han Solo surge en un momento determinante, es tremendamente significativo para el segundo personaje de la trilogía y tiene una coda natural para una muerte que creó terremotos de tinta. Resulta cínico que sea a esta entrega, la única de las tres que no se ajusta al esquema de ningún episodio de la trilogía original —‘El despertar de la fuerza’ se ajustaba al Episodio IV y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ quería ser desesperadamente ‘El imperio contraataca’— y vuela más libre, a la que se le acuse de regodearse en la nostalgia. Además, sin ir más lejos, la misma aparición “sorpresa” de esta se hacía en la anterior con Yoda, para después plantear un ataque con At-At a la base rebelde en un planeta en el que se cambia la nieve por sal.  Y no solo eso, ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ era la película de Han Solo, y ‘Los últimos Jedi’ de Luke, mientras que la muerte de Carrie Fisher ha impedido que esta sea completamente de Leia, por lo que el peso se ha apoyado plenamente en los materiales verdaderamente originales de esta nueva trilogía, Rey y Kylo Ren. Es su película y solo suya, sin embargo Abrams es generoso con el legado de la saga y trata de hacer algunas reverencias finales, pero en cantidad de minutos cualquiera de las anteriores tiene más elementos del pasado.  Otra de las “revoluciones” del Episodio VIII fue la inclusión de variaciones del uso de la fuerza que cabrearon muchísimo a los fans que decían que Luke no podía enviar su “holograma” a distancia, o que los encuentros de Rey y Kylo por su vinculación de la fuerza no eran posibles. Mientras Abrams es tachado de cobarde en medios de renombre, sus personajes no solo tienen encuentros con la fuerza sino que son capaces de teletransportar objetos en esas conexiones.  Algo que Johnson apuntaba con unas gotas de lluvia, aquí se convierte en un punto de trama definitivo al final, en una recreación fantástica del momento ‘Jungla de Cristal’ (Die Hard, 1988) de Bruce Willis, escondiendo un arma en su espalda en el enfrentamiento final. Pero no solo eso, sino que además, se atreve con nuevos poderes como la sanación haciendo una “transfusión” de fuerza e incluso la nigromancia propiamente dicha. Esto coincide con los poderes de Baby Yoda que aparecen el último episodio de ‘The Mandalorian’, estrenado dos días antes de la película, y que, curiosamente, nadie critica por su uso de la fuerza fuera del canon. En efecto, Abrams se muestra entusiasmado por los juguetes que le ha cedido Johnson y si no los utiliza de la misma manera —ojo a la influencia de Leia en su hijo Ben— los lleva más allá. Si esto es ir remando en contra del anterior, si es tratar de anular sus avances, queda en la cancha del espectador.  Confundir “fan service” con “hacer una buena película de Star Wars” desafía el cómo funcionan ciertas normas de la creación artística, desde el diseño gráfico al arte. Las limitaciones son una herramienta. Si Rothko hace cuadros con tres colores, hacer un cuadro con una paleta de 10 colores no va a hacer un mejor cuadro de Rothko, de hecho, es un signo de que quizá el artista que se apoya en todos los elementos a sus disposición, suple una falta de capacidad de crear de forma armónica con elementos sencillos. “Simple is hard” que dice Scorsese. ‘El Ascenso de Skywalker’ entiende que la subversión de las expectativas no es sinónimo de buena narrativa, y por supuesto que en ese sentido enmienda el trabajo de Johnson. Tiene una finalidad de llegar al final como un tercer acto. El problema es que ‘Los últimos Jedi’ jugaba a la sorpresa y la ruptura por razones que no tienen que ver con participar en una historia que va más allá del microcosmos de esa misma obra. Las subtramas de la anterior, con la búsqueda del código o la traición, no tenían un propósito global y, en retrospectiva, en una visión general, y ahora se muestran como un relleno. Se le ha achacado también que no es más que una gymkana de un sitio a otro, una persecución constante en el que en las prisas de los personajes se reflejan las prisas de la producción, pero no se aclara en estos comentarios que, precisamente toda 'El ascenso de Skywalker' es una misión contrareloj. A diferencia de otras entregas de la saga en las que el deadline aparece en el tercer acto, aquí surge desde un primer momento. Solo quedan 16 horas para que la orden final, un brillante juego con la solución final del tercer Reich, se desate. Por ello, el guion de Abrams y Terrio puede estar sobrecargado, puede tener problemas de atropellamiento y saturación de información, pero todas las sorpresas, incluso la no muerte de Chewbacca, tienen un propósito en la historia, todo se mueve en la misma dirección y acompaña a las ideas de ‘El despertar de la fuerza’. Cada misión de cada personaje acaba en un mismo vórtice que contribuye en algo al espectacular clímax del film. Incluso en cada escena de acción hay cierto propósito que se mueve con los sentimientos de los protagonistas. El trabajo de mímica de Ridley y Driver hace que sus peleas con sable sean algo más que una coreografía artística en una sala roja estéticamente bonita. Hay un propósito casi en cada golpe de espada, y la intensidad de sus ataques va acorde a la interpretación de movimientos, lenguaje corporal y gestos. Puede que no dirija tan bien, pero Abrams es un narrador visual puro y trabaja con la funcionalidad y la integración y el resultado es clasicista y dinámico.  ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ sorprende por su honestidad, al querer ir de frente con sus elementos de folletín y de aventuras clásicas a lo H. Rider Haggard, película de Indiana Jones (hasta en el atuendo de Poe Dameron) con veloces diálogos a lo Howard Hawks y síntesis de todo lo que ha hecho la saga memorable. Un ritmo afiladísimo y escenas de acción visualmente apabullantes, estéticamente atemporales, que se ajustan al de los grandes finales de sagas al estilo de ‘El señor de los anillos’ o la propia ‘Vengadores: Endgame’ (Avengers: Endgame, 2019). La diferencia con el final de Marvel es su trabajo hacia la fisicidad con una limitación de efectos digitales en personajes que la vuelve a acercar a lo terrenal, evitando estampidas animales de CGI. También incluye incursiones en naves de la primera orden, y trama de espionaje con la revelación del traidor, un elemento que aparece desde el principio y sorprende, pero afirmar que está sacado de la nada es no haber prestado atención al último plano de Domhnall Gleeson en ‘Los últimos Jedi’ y cómo le trata Ren, en general, durante todo el metraje de esta. El final se mueve irremediablemente a ‘El retorno del Jedi’ pero se desarrolla de forma diferente, con ese planeta fantasma con arquitectura salida de un relato de Lovecraft, y pura atmósfera de horror cósmico. El romance gótico con ecos a Emily Brönte y el final trágico con una estampa como la piedad es un cierre perfecto para los dos personajes principales. Pero la clave está en cómo conecta toda la saga y le da un nuevo sentido a todas las películas con respuestas sobre los Sith en su escena final de misa negra satánica espacial. La última confrontación del Emperador y Rey enfrenta a todos los caballeros Jedi y los Sith encarnados en ellos, de alguna forma se reúnen muchas generaciones en los últimos representantes vivos, asistiendo a una batalla minimalista para cerrar, gracias a una chatarrera sin apellido, una saga que empezó hace 42 años. Las generaciones de seguidores de ‘La guerra de las galaxias’, sus hijos e incluso nietos, confluyen también en ese momento. La resolución de la batalla naval de la rebelión, se salva en el último minuto, al estilo de Dunkerque. Todo gracias a la gente de a pie unida para ayudar, como se recalca en una línea de guion que hace un saludo a los fans, tan criticados y etiquetados, con una parte de lado oscuro, pero con una buena parte de ellos cuyo único pecado ha sido amar las películas y las historias salidas de la factoría Lucas. Ahora todo se ha convertido en una propia guerra entre fans, no fans, críticos y público, opinadores y directores de cine, tuiteros, youtubers de final explicado y gente a la que no le va ni viene pero sale de la cueva una vez al año para decir que le ha parecido una mierda. Lo de siempre.  ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ encontrará su público con el paso del tiempo, se seguirá hablando de ella y toda una generación tendrá nostalgia de Rey, Kylo Ren y su beso variación de ‘Duelo al Sol’ (Duel in the Sun, 1946). Se harán maratones especiales en el cine para rememorarla, mientras pocos recordarán las guerras clon que se sucedieron cada navidad de 2015 a 2019, cada vez que se estrenaba una de ellas. Destinada a la concordia, el Episodio IX ha creado más sangre, lo que hace preguntarnos si realmente nos merecemos más películas de ‘Star Wars’.",POSITIVE
"Dec 30, 2019"," When George Lucas debuted his film “Star Wars” in 1977, no one could have predicted just how much of a sensation it would ultimately become – spawning three trilogy compilations that cover an equal number of generations, stand-alone spinoffs such as “Rogue One” and “Solo” (each tagged as a “Star Wars” story), animated television series and an accountant’s dream of merchandise-generated income. Now with “Star Wars: Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker,” that original story line, beginning with Anakin Skywalker, proceeding with Luke Skywalker and culminating with a third and final Skywalker – not to mention the various characters surrounding this trio so strong with The Force – has seemingly come to an end. It was left to J.J. Abrams, the aging wunderkind behind the “Star Trek” reboot, to produce the final three films – referred to as the “sequel trilogy,” following the “original trilogy” and then the “prequel trilogy.” In addition to executive-producing Rian Johnson’s 2017 “Star Wars: Episode VIII, The Last Jedi,” Abrams co-wrote and directed both 2015’s “Star Wars: Episode VII, The Force Awakens” and now “The Rise of Skywalker.” Much has been written about how Johnson’s movie departed, at least a bit, from the franchise’s standard tropes – and how much furor that caused among die-hard fans. Few are likely to make similar complaints about what Abrams offers as the finale. Without divulging any spoilers, it’s enough to say that “Episode IX” continues the quest embarked upon by Rey (again played by Daisy Ridley). As part of the so-called Resistance, she – along with friends Finn (John Boyega), Po (Oscar Isaacs) and a number of others – spends the film’s two-and-a-half-hour running time searching for the source of the new tyranny threatening the galaxy. At the same time, she keeps trying (mostly in vain) to avoid her arch foe, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), with whom she has a powerful connection that neither fully understands – but, also, that neither has the power to ignore. If you’ve seen the previous films, you can predict how things end. Maybe you won’t be able to foresee all the specifics. But it’s safe to say that “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t offer any real surprises – other than the deaths of some familiar characters and the resurrection of notable others. What’s more noteworthy is how Abrams has updated Lucas’ storyline to abide by 2019 mores. How women can now fill the role of hero, how characters of races traditionally seen as tertiary can now step into the spotlight and even how the very term gender – and the notion of sexual orientation itself – can be seen as naturally fluid. There is value to this, of course. The problem is that it all feels a bit too calculated, as if Abrams were merely ticking off boxes instead of portraying a “Star Wars” world in which such attitudes are intrinsic.  Give directly to The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages community forums series -- which helps to offset the costs of several reporter and editor positions at the newspaper -- by using the easy options below.

"Dec 30, 2019"," What is Star Wars about, really? It’s a good question, one we’ve pondered for 42 years. Star Wars is so broad, so dense, and at times so frustratingly transparent, that you can graft just about any sort of meaning onto it. And yet, its mass appeal is often distilled to one word: Star Wars is about hope. But what does it mean to have hope? Everyone will offer a different answer. Hope can mean defiance in the face of adversity. It can mean happily ever afters. It can mean togetherness, family, friendship–those little things worth fighting for, even knowing they’re temporary. At its best, Star Wars captures that, freezing tiny moments of hope in amber. Luke, Leia, and Han hugging after the destruction of the Death Star. Anakin Skywalker clutching the face of his pregnant wife, Padmé. Finn and Poe escaping the tyrannical First Order. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,  the final film in this epic saga, is meant to tie a bow on the franchise, which began with A New Hope. Reasonably, one would expect those messages to come through more elegantly and emotionally than ever before. But the result is instead a sad case of confused identity. It’s a film that thinks it’s doing what it needs to, while ultimately delivering a series of rushed, soulless, and ill-defined points of logic. It’s “hopeful” if your idea of hope is tragic and cyclical to the point of feeling regurgitated. There are moments of optimism immediately staked through in heart in favor of “the next big set piece.” It’s a cruel and unsatisfying ending to a forty-year legacy, and one that feels openly critical of itself and everything it stands for, but shrugs its way to the finish line instead. The Disney era of Lucasfilm was fit more for profit than integrity from the get-go, and the need to rush out a new episodic film loaded with the original’s stars felt as bankable as it was inevitable. Suffice it to say, the Star Wars sequel trilogy attracted critics, but the first two films shuffled through a variety of production woes to successful, appealing conclusions. J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens paired a new cast of characters with our legacy trio–Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher)–creating a spark of whimsical magic that overshadowed its derivative setbacks. Rian Johnson delivered a wild animal of a sequel with The Last Jedi , a surprising and frankly revolutionary studio blockbuster that turned the series’ larger story on its head. It was as divisive as it was fertile with big, new, promising ideas. The film ended with the Force decentralized from a few exclusive bloodlines and democratized, reigniting hope in the galaxy. Unfortunately, The Rise of Skywalker picks up on none of those loose threads. The film begins with a flippant dismissal of many if not all of The Last Jedi‘s themes. The opening crawl explains that Emperor Palpatine has inexplicably returned (and I do mean inexplicably–we never learn how), and has been orchestrating the First Order experiment from the beginning. Somehow, he groomed Ben Solo into Kylo Ren from afar, and now locks his sights on Rey from Jakku, our unruly, orphaned Force user and Kylo’s counterpart. From the outset, Abrams shrinks the Star Wars universe back down to a more immediately interconnected, even insular size. Palpatine is back because, uh, sure, why not? The story plays out as antagonistically as that. Abrams, returning as co-writer/director to replace Colin Trevorrow, demonstrates a bewildering sense of his audience’s wants and needs. Does he think we don’t care about the mysterious resurrection of the saga’s most selfish and mystifying villain? Is he purposely leaving gaps in the story for canon material to fill in? Did he think a single thing out beyond “looks cool, feels OK, boom, bang?” Who knows. But the movie opens with the reintroduction of Palpatine, them immediately launches us into the Millennium Falcon, where Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) quickly discover that there’s a mole in the First Order. We’re then teleported to a new Resistance base where Leia trains Rey (Daisy Ridley) in the ways of the Force. Before we’re oriented in this location, we’re shuffled into another adventure jam-packed with MacGuffins, whirlygigs, and ultimately dead ends. The adventure is poorly defined and confusing, but Abrams doesn’t expect us to be smart. He’s content to race through every would-be meaningful moment at the quickest possible pace, exploiting that whiplash effect to distract us from the story’s garbled plotting. We know that our heroes are on a race to find Palpatine, and are looking for something called a “wayfinder” that will lead them to his location. There are only two wayfinders, and Kylo Ren finds the other one in an opening scene. Abrams creates a sense of urgency, but we don’t really know why, and no one seems convincingly terrified that the universe is on the brink of absolute annihilation. At least the original trilogy only featured one Death Star at a time, and developed centralized locations that defined personal stakes and brewed emotion. This film has a whole army of planet-destroying ships, locations with no names or personalities, and characters previously emphasized who are here utterly left to the wind. And that’s the real failure of The Rise of Skywalker. It mishandles literally every character,  except, arguably, C-3PO. Rey gets tacked onto a legacy story that erodes the entire thematic heart of not just The Last Jedi, but even Abrams’ own The Force Awakens. By some disgusting leap of imagination, she’s Palpatine’s granddaughter. Rey’s parents weren’t actually alcoholics who sold her for drinking money (a bit never reconciled), but good people who loved her enough to protect her from Gramps, and apparently, themselves. Finn (John Boyega) is suddenly and inexplicably Force sensitive, which is a nice little treat and possible nod to the end of The Last Jedi, but is only really employed to detect when Rey’s in peril. Outside of one nice moment with Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a fellow defected stormtrooper he meets on the road, his arc from indentured villain to Rebel hero goes largely unaddressed. Worse, even his relationship with Poe feels weirdly underdeveloped. Poe (Oscar Isaac), meanwhile, is very much “present,” but that’s really all he is. He became something of a de facto leader at the end of The Last Jedi, but Abrams fails to hint at any sense of real authority or growth here. He bickers with Rey and continues to act like a self-important flyboy, echoing a roguish Han Solo-esque fearlessness, but where his presence is maximized, his importance really isn’t. His story and Leia’s should be more interconnected after she taught him a valuable lesson last time around, but  the loss of Carrie Fisher unfortunately obstructs his development as a character. Using a mishmash of unused footage from The Force Awakens, they try to conjure her spirit elsewhere, but it doesn’t totally work. That said, the movie at least attempts to do right by her legacy. Further, Leia’s death in the film helps create two of its best moments. She uses a last ounce of strength to send Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) a memory of his father, Han, who reappears with some paternal advice. It should be a silly moment, but tonally it absolutely works, sold completely by the fine work of Ford and Driver. As father and son reconnect, Kylo Ren finally transforms back into Ben Solo–he tosses his jagged lightsaber into the abyss and goes off to save Rey, who he loves. This whole sequence is preceded by a lightsaber duel where Kylo is left mortally wounded; Rey heals him, and confesses her feelings for the man he could be. Love–and hope–seem temporarily destined to win. And they do… sort of? The third act is where The Rise of Skywalker totally loses sight of everything it’s trying to be. Rey is drawn into Palpatine’s lair, and  there’s a lot of business about Sith and Jedi that doesn’t really make sense. Above them, the war between the “Final Order” (Palpatine’s new name for the galactic baddies) and the Resistance rages, a total lazy mirror to the end of Return of the Jedi. Palpatine wants to funnel his strength into Rey via some ancient ritual, but Ben shows up. Ben and Rey fight together against Palpatine, Rey summons the spirit of all of the Jedi who ever lived, and she beats her grandpa with his own superpower (in a very Harry Potter-esque showdown) before dying. Ben uses the last of his life power to resurrect her–a nice mirror of their Death Star scene earlier in the film–and they kiss. But he then dies, leaving Rey once again as the galaxy’s only real Force of hope. She temporarily reunites with the Resistance–who defeated the Final Order with the help of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), appearing in the movie just long enough to serve as a deus ex machina–before jetting off to Tatooine. And finally, Rey takes on the last name Skywalker and sees Luke and Leia’s Force ghosts. The end. Unbelievably, a lot more happens than that. Abrams introduces Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), a fun, masked ex-fling of Poe’s who’s super cool but completely inconsequential to the plot. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico effectively takes a Resistance desk job, which feels particularly insulting after everything she accomplished in The Last Jedi. There are more “Force Skype” scenes between Rey and Kylo, and Rey confronts her own inner darkness, manifested in “Dark Rey,” while Abrams introduces a cute new droid named D-O, and throws a lot of other random things at the wall that never stick (like a visit with the ghost of Luke Skywalker during a temporary detour to Ahch-To). It’s as messy as it is ambitious, and Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio’s deserve some credit for spinning such a clotted web that you’re frequently distracted from all of the holes in it. But then there’s the whole hope thing. And there’s really no cohesive sense of it here. As a series-ender, this story should resonate more than it does. The Last Jedi contends with the past more, and better, than Skywalker does; it wrestled with the sins of the Jedi and Sith, and kicked open a bigger door for generations to come. Skywalker says nothing about where they, or we, go from here. It ends with Rey abandoned and alone, except for her Force ghost friends, on another desert planet. The  one person in the galaxy who ever understood her dies. And he evidently doesn’t redeem himself successfully enough to become a Force ghost. Is death really the only avenue to peace and purpose? Effectively, Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Leia Organa all died to save Ben, who then died to save Rey. What is her next step? The movie doesn’t say, or seem to know. It’s a domino effect, with nothing but tragedy at the end of every spill. That idea could work if the moments in between felt rewarding, or the losses served larger narrative or thematic ideas. But in this story, meant to be a conclusion to a single film, a trilogy and a nine-film saga, they don’t. Rey, Finn, and Poe share only a superficial sense of camaraderie. Their future adventures will lead to moments of happiness and enlightenment along the way. But why does Abrams ignore or de-emphasize those feelings? In The Rise of Skywalker, hope is little more than a ghost. And after more than 40 years, it’s one that Star Wars is still chasing, with no real end in sight.",NEGATIVE

Sure, we'd already survived Endgame, and John Wick came through and killed everybody for a third time, but like we told you back in the summer, AWARDS SZN was coming with a vengeance, and the way things shook out this year, we got plenty of stellar cinema moments this fourth quarter. This year, more than others, has been relatively diverse in terms of what we're loving; the prerequisite costumed superhero tales make the cut, but we also saw Lena and Melina make magic together for the first time on the silver screen, while Rian Johnson survived The Last Jedi to bring forth one hilarious whodunit, and Jennifer Lopez gave what many are considering to be the best performance of her career in acting.

Grab your popcorn, or at the very least figure out where you can stream or purchase these films. In an era of massive CGI blockbusters, a film as simple and clean as High Flying Bird feels almost revolutionary. This is fitting because the creative forces behind the film are quietly advocating for revolution.  The simple yet expert construction of High Flying Bird has the same elegance of a perfect bounce pass or layup. Steven Soderbergh and his star André Holland clearly trust each other, and that trust means they don’t have to take any unneeded steps to tell the story they want to tell. They take a screenplay with high-minded ideals by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight) and execute the coach’s game plan with unadorned tenacity.

They take a screenplay with high-minded ideals by the playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney (Moonlight) and execute the coach’s game plan with unadorned tenacity. Superficially, the story is about a fictitious NBA lockout and agent Ray Burke’s (Holland) plan to end it. A simple goal complicated by the machinations of other power players, Burke’s crusade amount, more or less, to a heist film. Within the fairly straightforward structure, Soderbergh has the opportunity to explore race, money, sex, and power without wallowing in and glorifying the excesses of the professional sports world.

I’m wasn’t sure what the fuck was happening in this movie most of the time, but I liked what the GOAT Claire Denis was on. High Life is a mindfuck that takes its time mindfucking you until the very end. There’s a baby on the ship, and everyone is dead except for her and Monte (Robert Pattinson). The story starts to make sense as they embed flashbacks here and there as Monte and the baby try to deal with life in seclusion on this spaceship that’s tumbling through nothingness. André 3000 pops up and sleeps in the garden, which makes sense in an André 3000 kind of way. There’s this doctor (Juliette Binoche) who is meant to look and act like a witch with her mysterious ways. There’s a scene where she’s having wild tantric sex in space in what Tcherny (3 Stacks) calls the “fuck box.” And she channels the devil (maybe?) after she puts a condom on a metal dildo.  So much has been said about the compelling story of The Farewell and the buoyant breakout performance of Awkwafina that it feels necessary to focus our attention elsewhere as we continue to talk about the greatness of this film.  While it is egregious on its face that no women were nominated for the Best Director Golden Globe, the idea that what Lulu Wang achieved in this film is in any way less than what the other male nominees did in their work is ridiculous. Specifically, the idea that Todd Phillips’ sometimes clumsy and muddled direction of Joker was superior to Wang’s expert technical and creative direction of The Farewell is the biggest robbery in an awards season is sure to bring plenty of disappointment.  Wang is already a master of directing within the frame, despite the fact this is just her second feature. She tends not to cut, but rather opts to have her actors move within the shot, creating two shots, long shots, and close-ups without cutting. Wang understands that actors need time to explore emotional shifts within a scene and she generously lets them have it. In a film about the grieving process this approach isn’t just smart, it feels necessary.  Wang is already a master of directing within the frame, despite the fact this is just her second feature.

Wang understands that actors need time to explore emotional shifts within a scene and she generously lets them have it. In a film about the grieving process this approach isn’t just smart, it feels necessary. Wang’s directorial style is perfectly suited to this claustrophobic story which shoves numerous family members who have been spread across the world into one small apartment to reckon with what has become of their relationships. The result of this pressure cooker technical approach is a film that is hilarious and heartbreaking, sweet and sad, swinging through poles of emotion with ease, always ready to smack you with a new and unexpected feeling.  It’s tough, in 2019, to put into context just how spectacular the live recording of Aretha Franklin’s Amazing Grace album was. Coming off a Grammy win for her classic, Gold-selling Young, Gifted and Black album, Aretha decided to put a pause on her career and return to her roots. She, along with the Southern California Community Choir, setup shop at the New Temple Missionary Baptist Church in Watts, Los Angeles and put on one of the most revelatory performances the genre had ever witnessed. Only issue was that only a handful of people got to actually witness it.  Filmed by Sydney Pollack with the intention of being released alongside the Grammy Award-winning double-disc album that became the best-selling gospel album of all time, it was shelved for a myriad of reasons including an issue with the audio and visual synchronization. But, 40 years later, with the help of producer Alan Elliott, the film finally saw a big-screen release.  In it, audiences get to see a young Aretha at the height of her powers de- and reconstructing gospel standards. The film acts as a testament to the celestial talent that poured out of Ms. Franklin every time she opened her mouth.  Pour one out for the GOAT villain Thanos, who dies not once but twice for his Infinity War triumph in Endgame. Over the course of three-plus hours, we get a few different films. The first part of the film? Redemption. The heroes are looking to pick up the pieces of a world that Thanos broke with the snap of his fingers; once they find him and realize that he destroyed his tool of destruction (which they hoped would be the tool of Earth’s rejuvenation), it’s off with his head, and off on a journey to figure out how to live in a broken world. The entire second act is sorting out how to bring the world back to normal, which finds Marvel rewriting the rules of time travel (for better or worse) and letting Ant-Man do what he does best: go on a heist. Will everything work itself out? Of course it will; those “dead” heroes had films to make. The heroes win (while one truly sacrifices himself), and the changes from this final battle set the course for the future of the MCU.

I knew we’d get a scene where all of the fallen would be avenged and back to do battle, but I didn’t expect to fall in love with Thanos all over again. What other Big Bad has the stones to stand tall in the face of the Avengers, broken and living out the rest of his life, and let them know that they are INEVITABLE?! What past version of the same Big Bad, in realizing what his future self does, watches THE PLAYBACK OF HIS FUTURE DEATH and SMIRKS? What Big Bad, who finds his way to the future in hopes of claiming the Infinity Stones once again, takes off his helmet, sits on a rock, and is like, “AYE GO GET MY STONES”?! And, finally, what Big Bad could take on the combined forces of Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor by themselves, with zero Stones on his person? The Mad Titan Thanos, that’s who.

The beauty of Lena Waithe and Melina Matsoukas linking up once again (Matsoukas directed the Master of None episode ""Thanksgiving"" that Waithe won her Emmy for) for their collective feature film debut was felt before fans saw a second of film. Two of the biggest black voices in the world of entertainment, joining forces for a tale where a white police officer is gunned down by a black man and woman after their mid Tinder date, forcing the two of them to go on the run? Sign me TF up!  Listen, I ride for superhero movies. I show up opening night with all the grown men in capes, and even have a Disney+ subscription (or at least someone else’s login). But at the same time, I’m also a film geek, and I’ve got to agree with the boy Marty—Personal journeys and in-depth character exploration are disappearing facets of modern cinema. That’s why when I heard they were making a Joker origin story I couldn’t help but ask why. Why take the marquee space away from another unseen story, only to go and do what’s been done in countless Batman flicks before? Then I peeped it for myself, and I totally understood.

The plot twists of Nolan, the action of Snyder, the clown prince of crime portrayed by Nicholson and Ledger are all relegated to the background if not completely omitted. Normally I’d walk out of a movie so thin on plot wishing I’d been given more, but those movies don’t have Joaquin Phoenix. With hands down the best performance of 2019, and possibly Phoenix’s career, whatever worries you had about this being a Dark Knight lite are quickly extinguished, leaving no doubt about The Joker’s true focus: Arthur Fleck.

Simply put, Hustlers is damn good fun. It’s an unfiltered, unapologetic jolt of energy that makes every moment feel like a rush of empowering ecstasy. Writer and director Lorene Scarafia takes an inverted look at the male gaze - showing how the women tactfully use the male gaze to their advantage. With their sexuality, physicality, and sheer wit, these women lure their male clients into a drug-induced stupor and drain their bank accounts without so much as a hint of guilt. But Taking place after the 2008 financial crisis, Hustlers presents the argument that the real scammers are the men that force these women to conduct illegal schemes. We take a closer, slow-motion look at the victims - (primarily) rich older white bankers who walked away from the crash without consequences and went straight to the strip clubs, credit cards ready to go as they plan their next scheme.  Sometimes a film can live or die on the strength of a single performance. In the case of Honey Boy, one actor is the film. Shia LaBeouf both wrote the script for Honey Boy and stars as his own father in the deeply autobiographical story of a young man in rehab looking back on his childhood as an actor managed by his drug-addicted abusive father.  The rehab sequences have interesting moments as the adult “Otis,” played by Lucas Hedges, reflects on his life and his father. But, this section of the film is imminently forgettable. It is the flashbacks, dominated by LeBeouf’s frustrated, angry, and pathetic “James” that make the film special.  Honey Boy is by no means a perfect film. First time director Alma Har’el is at her best when she simply gets out of the way of LeBeouf and his compelling young co-star Noah Jupe. When the directing does more than merely document, misguided dream sequences, and clumsy love scenes verge on incompetence. The other actors, like the promising but green FKA Twigs, are practically begging for more hands-on direction. However, when the camera simply lets Shia channel his father and interact with his son, this film is magic.  It might be more accurate to call Honey Boy a character study or psychological portrait than traditional a narrative film. We are literally and figuratively watching an hour-and-a-half long therapy session for LeBeouf, who clearly has a lot of shit to figure out. And while not a lot happens in plot terms, we are certainly taken on a journey.

It’s hard to think of an actor with more power on-screen working today than Shia LeBeouf. With a tenacity that evokes a young Marlon Brando, LeBeouf is mesmerizing from start to finish. To watch him work is a real cinematic pleasure.  This is all more compelling than it sounds. It’s hard to think of an actor with more power on-screen working today than Shia LeBeouf.

To say that The Last Black Man in San Francisco is about gentrification might make it sound dry or academic. Amazingly, the film manages to tell a story about urban displacement that is emotional and intimate while also concerning itself deeply social and political.  To say that The Last Black Man in San Francisco is about gentrification might make it sound dry or academic. Amazingly, the film manages to tell a story about urban displacement that is emotional and intimate while also concerning itself deeply social and political. But, the film truly is about gentrification, giving the wonky arguments raging across the country about rent control, development, and NIMBY-ism a human face. More deeply, the film also asks us to consider what it means to have a home, how deep our roots need to be in a community before we can lay claim to it, what say we have as communities change, and whether or not we can ever truly have a home at all.  Smartly, director Joe Talbot uses touches of magical realism to infuse a story that could be cold and dry with a sense of whimsy and joy. Shots of men in hazmat suits and characters rowing boats in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge combined with stunning, colorful visuals and poetic language elevate the film to the level of fable.

Shots of men in hazmat suits and characters rowing boats in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge combined with stunning, colorful visuals and poetic language elevate the film to the level of fable. And that’s exactly what the film is: a fable about gentrification. With its beautiful language and imagery the film serves as a fairy tale-like warning about the way American cities treat their communities as disposable. Through the beautiful performances of Jimmie Fails and Jonathan Majors, Last Black Man in San Francisco warns us that there is only so much we can push and pull the communities of America around the whims of the rich. There are only so many neighborhoods artists can spark to life only to have them painted over in Apple Store Silver and Whole Foods green before the artists have no more life to give.  There are about nine (nine!) big action setpieces in John Wick 3. All are fantastic and varied (though the horse kicks got a little repetitive), and as such, everyone has their favorite. Mine comes early in the film, as the titular hitman extraordinaire does battle with peers who have tracked him to an antique weapons shop. Naturally, the rustic knives and guns around them become fodder to the assassins in their assault and John in his defense. But that’s the key word there: naturally.

In 2014, when John Wick was but a mere pleasantly surprising B-movie with grade-A return on investment, its marvel lay in how deftly it executed its mission: to, quite simply, restore the feeling to the action genre, stateside, at least. Hand-to-hand combat scenes had lost all their luster; gunfights were barely distinguishable from a video game. (Remember, while Tom Cruise was working on his own restoration with Mission: Impossible 5, at this point that was still 10 months away.) The action in John Wick is gorgeous, choreographed with loving precision by two directors who came up as stuntmen/stunt coordinators, and their affinity for the poetry of combat is palpable. “There’s an arc to an action sequence, and you need to come out the other end knowing your character better and maybe the story has moved forward in a compelling way,” Wick co-director David Leitch once told me. “I think—and the audience may not realize it—how much you learn about a character during an action sequence and how much it defines the character.” Leitch left Chad Stahelski to helm the sequels on his own, but true to his words, by Wick 3, the story and the choreography have marvelously changed with it to reflect—and advance—the narrative. John isn’t the well-rested, sleek killing machine of 2014’s neo-revenge tale. In-story, all three films cover about a week, two and a half at most. John Wick is burnt out, literally running on fumes. There’s a sense of inherent improvisation to the wins he ekes out—when he notices those knives, it’s a relief, and Keanu and Stahelski somehow make an obviously thoroughly choreographed scene still feel like it’s being freestyled and our frayed hero is winning by the skin of his teeth. And that, reader, is why an action movie with not much besides bullets, severed thumbs, and gloriously vicious attack dogs still registers as a movie of substance, precision, and deep thought.

In 2007, when Matthew Weiner previewed his '60s-era drama Mad Men for the TV critic Alan Sepinwall ahead of the pilot, he teased, ""It's about time travel."" I thought back to that quote following my second time watching Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood in its opening weekend, a movie that isn't merely set in 1969 Los Angeles so much as it fully immerses us in it. From sensory flourishes like the radio to, of course, the aesthetics like the landmark neon signs that illuminate the city to the Hollywood universe and its interweaving cast of characters (Cliff Booth's run-in with Bruce Lee is the front-page news, sure, but note Sharon's flashback to training with him as she watches her big fight scene in the theater), Once Upon a Time is as if Tarantino hopped on the nostalgia carousel and got stuck there. And much like Mad Men, the movie is less a pulp thriller with history-altering implications than it is a living, breathing snapshot of a culture on the verge of a seismic shift, simultaneously a love letter to both the mid-transformation era it depicts and the golden years its leads long to recapture in vain. Tarantino recently described the film as his climax, with his proposed 10th and final film set to be more of an epilogue than a big finish. He needn't have explained it; it's a sentiment the movie already gives off on its own. This isn't his best movie, but, nonetheless, it does feel like a summation of everything that preceded it.

The fictional tales woven into real-life tapestries (Inglourious, Django), the Western affinity (Hateful Eight), homing in on stuntmen to symbolize his fascination with the era (Death Proof's Stuntman Mike)...this is what he's been building towards since at least the back half of his career, and I'm sure more thematic connections to more of his films will continue to reveal themselves upon further scrutiny. In lieu of having a larger statement (or, hell, just a use for) the Manson children beyond window dressing, Once's detractors argue for a Point. But what better way for the video store clerk cinephile to begin bowing out than to make a movie about the movies? This is the era that made Tarantino who he is, that informed every classic he's given us since 1992. It features, in spots, some of his most graceless writing (the narration to bridge Acts II and III is just clumsy, ain't no way around it); it features some of his most subtly stylistic directing, like the way the camera never widens or swivels when Rick flubs a take on the Lancer pilot, lest we realize we're on a set not *in* the TV show, with the camera going so far as to literally reset when the scene winds back.

No film has taken us through more surprises and more suffering this year than Parasite. Writer and director Bong Joon Ho’s unforgiving look at class inequality is one of the most thrilling and haunting stories this year. Seemingly a film about one family’s manipulation of another, Parasite is an unflinching microcosm of capitalism’s ability to pit the multiples tiers of the working class against each other, driving them to commit acts of cruelty for the unselfish sake of survival while the wealthy elite rest on, and benefit from, their endless struggles.  Uncut Gems releasing (widely, at least) during the holidays actually makes perfect sense. It's hard to immediately recall the last time prestige critical acclaim and a true-blue crowd-pleaser lined up this congruously. Here's a movie helmed by film media darlings, on a totally original, IP-less script (although I would totally watch a Howard Ratner versus Connie Nikas team-up in the Safdie Cinematic Universe) that would nonetheless have a high success rate among all varying members of the family for the post-dinner watch.

I saw it for the first time almost three months ago. It was one of the most visceral movie-watching experiences I'd had in a long time, an experience that's stayed with me thus far. As the movie spreads, I'm hearing reports of similar viewing interactions. A crowd of people shooting out of their seats during a pivotal tipoff. Outcries during the ending. Uncut Gems might not even be as consistently intense as the Safdie brothers' previous rollercoaster Good Time—there are more moments to breathe at least, before the cart goes full tilt in the final 30 minutes—but nevertheless, it's a shot of pure adrenaline to the heart, served with a side of substance.

This movie couldn't work without Sandler, whom the brothers pluck from the rolling hills of Netflix Mount Olmypus and cast down into an uber-specific circle of hell: Manhattan's Diamond District. But pitch-perfect casting is just one piece of a puzzle that goes into creating a new, all-time character. The movie works because of how deeply realized Sandler's Howard Ratner is on all levels of production, from Sandler and his castmates analyzing his every decision, to costume, to the brothers' deep reverence of him to a point they deem calling him an ""antihero"" as derisive. And it's that emotional investment, that perfect mix of sleaze, charm, empathy, pity, and even a little admiration that leaves the film lodged in your brain long after the fact and begging for a rewatch.

"Dec 30, 2019"," Sin leña se apaga el fuego. Ni más ni menos esto es lo que le sucede al supuesto cierre del gran arco narrativo que, al comenzar, se mercadeó por estos lares con el título en castellano de La guerra de las galaxias y contó con la agudeza del director George Lucas. Ahora cierra sin el brío ni la lógica del comienzo, con título en inglés, con otros directores y, lo peor, con las manos de los estudios Disney ahí metidas, quienes piensan siempre en cómo hacer dinero y no en cómo hacer un buen filme. Con un guion perezoso en conceptos y lleno de repetidas acciones, lo demás es culpa de un director mediocre: J.J. Abrams. El título ahora es Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker, una historia de venganza nunca bien racionalizada y sin conceptos más nobles, como los que les daban cuerpo a películas anteriores: justicia, paz, amor, equilibrio político y otros que ustedes pueden señalar. Parte de una trilogía, el filme de hoy intenta abordar o tener presente el universo habido en Star Wars o La guerra de las galaxias. Por ahí pierde concentración (quien mucho abarca, poco aprieta). Esta vez ni siquiera se atrevieron a los sugerentes cambios que el director Rian Johnson logró en Los últimos Jedi (2017). Para volver a lo tradicional, lo mejor es un director también tradicional, de esos que llegan por encargo, y así lo entendió J.J. Abrams. Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker es filme lleno de acción y de peleas poco novedosas, porque a falta de pan, buenas son las tortas: se muestra sin originalidad dentro de su propio mundo narrado. Con vacíos narrativos que la afectan en grado sumo, con largas ausencias de personajes que –luego– aparecen de repente y que llegan como hojas del cielo para envolver tamales, la película deviene redundante en sí misma y esto le es fatal. Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker es la película de esta saga con más torpezas narrativas y su exceso de acción más bien aburre con efectos visuales no tan creativos ni virtuosos. Este filme es como el llamado a misa de las campanas de una iglesia: el mismo talán-talán. La actriz Daisy Ridley no pasa de ser una atractiva modelo metida en el traje equivocado y, de todo el equipo, uno puede rescatar los esfuerzos del actor Oscar Isaac por hacer las cosas bien y darle alguna fuerza dramática a los acontecimientos. Lo que sí le resulta horrible a la película son sus secuencias melodramáticas, como quien intenta escribir un poema de amor en medio de un huracán. El público, incluso, se ríe en algunas de esas secuencias, porque los besos que vemos parecen más bien de cuentos de hadas en filmes de Disney. Película sin cohesión, es un pastiche desordenado más de la cuenta. No se puede recomendar, es como ir a comer y que le den bicarbonato como plato principal.

"Dec 29, 2019"," “Something old, something new” seems to be the defining philosophy behind the third and final(?) trilogy of films set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Wars: The Last Jedi and now Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker have all cannily placed familiar motifs in new packaging, a mixing and matching that has drawn praise in some quarters while earning vilification in others. Lifelong Star Wars fans have perhaps been more lenient while naysayers have definitely been more critical — those factors clearly come into play with this new picture, which is the least of the three yet still manages to send the series off in a satisfactory manner. Spoilers are an absolute no-no when it comes to this franchise, but, since it’s been revealed in the opening scrawl and even some of the marketing, it’s no shock to learn that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has somehow returned from the dead and seeks to reclaim his position of prominence among the galaxy’s foremost evildoers. Realizing that something is afoot, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), accompanied by Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and BB-8, set out following a trail of clues while General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher, courtesy of carefully arranged footage left over from The Last Jedi) and R2-D2 remain with the troops. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) continues to pursue his own claim to absolute power. That’s a frightfully short synopsis, but the more surprises, the better when it comes to this latest endeavor. Certainly, there’s much about the picture that annoys and might even infuriate. Starting with Palpatine, the dead have a way of returning with absurd frequency — Star Wars has always been about sacrifice as much as anything, but when characters can repeatedly bounce back like video game avatars, it takes away much of the meaning and import. The delicious tension between Kylo Ren and the easily agitated General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) has been a constant highlight of this trilogy, and the manner in which it’s suddenly truncated is extremely disappointing. While Palpatine is certainly a fan favorite (albeit not a fave of mine), he’s basically the same one-note villain as before — like one of those dolls where you pull the string and it repeats the same five or six phrases, he seems capable of only uttering dialogue along the lines of “Come to the Dark Side” and “Give in to your hate.” And speaking of dialogue, some of the lines placed in the mouths of other characters (courtesy of director J.J. Abrams and Argo Oscar winner Chris Terrio) are awfully clunky, recalling George Lucas’ lesser moments with the prequels. But the nitpicks are small compared to what the film gets right. The relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren remains suitably complex and conflicted, and this storyline plays out in deeply moving fashion. Rey is provided some essential backstory that allows her to come into clearer focus, while Poe Dameron is finally allowed to fully evolve as a character. Aside from a ghastly CGI rendition of a youthful Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia, the effects are outstanding. And Lando Calrissian! While the character was noticeably MIA in the first two pictures, that enhances his belated appearance here, and Billy Dee Williams is clearly having the time of his life. Lando isn’t the film’s only blast from the past. Since this is (supposedly) the final chapter in the Skywalker saga, there’s a “Greatest Hits” feel to the film, with all manner of past players making cameos: a veteran X-Wing pilot, disembodied Jedi masters, even those infernal Endor furries. And the final shot is perfect, invoking a bit of John Ford mythmaking while bringing the saga full circle in a way that’s immensely fulfilling rather than forced.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019"," The “Star Wars” universe is built on rivalries. The light and dark sides of the Force. The Empire versus the Rebel Alliance (or whatever the new substitute sides are called). Hayden Christensen and acting. The latest conflict pits fans of director Rian Johnson’s iconoclastic interpretation of the “Star Wars” milieu versus those those who regard it as an affront to the series’ longstanding lore. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the purported final chapter in the space opera, returns “Force Awakens” director J.J. Abrams to the helm. With that also comes the return of several favorite Abrams devices: MacGuffins, lens flares, Keri Russell, etc. However, the much-reviled (by some) notion that Abrams jettisons every narrative that Johnson introduced in “Last Jedi” is nonsense. Indeed, for all the clash of filmmaking styles between the two filmmakers, the most essential narrative element in “Rise of Skywalker” is the through line connecting the entire latter day trilogy: the defining relationship between newest last Jedi hope Rey (Daisy Ridley) and petulant emo Skywalker spawn Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Their love-hate tête-à-tête remains front and center in “Rise of Skywalker,” even amid some mind-numbing periphery. For all the film’s bluster and bloat, its insistence on culminating with this pairing — and all it signifies — proves a firm foundation. Everything else around it, on the other hand, is less than stellar. The film begins with the abrupt return of Emperor Palpatine, whose voice has suddenly been heard throughout the galaxy (no clue of how or why) and caused alarm with both Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and Kylo. How abrupt, you ask? Well, it’s in the opening crawl, so we’re left to just accept that a key character apparently killed in “Return of the Jedi” is suddenly back with no build-up or explanation. It seems Palpatine forged a couple of horcruxes, so Kylo finds one that leads him to the Sith planet of Exegol (I thought the Sith homeworld was Korriban, but it’s best to not go down that or any other rabbit hole). There, a withered Palpatine is kept animated by caretakers and a contraption of tubes. Kylo, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, plans to slay this potential rival, but Palpatine woos him the Sith throne and seemingly hundreds of Star Destroyers lying dormant beneath the planet’s icy surface, which Palpatine unearths and pledges to something he calls the Final Order. A few questions. Where did this immense fleet of ships come from, and how/why have they been hidden all this time? Where did the crew manning these ships come from? Why hasn’t this fleet been used before now? And no, it shouldn’t be incumbent on me to digest some “Star Wars” anthology or Reddit thread in order to make sense of it all. Meanwhile, Leia sends Rey, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, given his best part in a long time) on their own Palpatine scavenger hunt. Their journey takes them on a “Star Wars” revue, including an aging Lando Calrissan (Billy Dee Williams). They hopscotch planets looking for the other horcrux, which they can only find using inscriptions on a hidden Sith dagger, which they can only translate using...you get the picture. Old “Star Wars” favorites pop up, and there’s a climactic space battle to save the galaxy (natch) once the Resistance (and the audience) suddenly discovers that the Final Order’s fleet is somehow equipped with guns capable of destroying a planet, a la the Death Star. Huh? While the rest of the film frantically tries to shove as much as possible into an imperfect vessel, Rey and Kylo continue their inevitable rendezvous, commensurating and even dueling via the Force projection phenomenon Johnson introduced in “Last Jedi.” Their journey ends at Exegol, where the real conflict at the heart of this third trilogy culminates. Rey and Kylo represent the dyad of the Force — one virtue of this film trilogy is that the light side of the Force is depicted as co-equal with the dark, contrary to previous “Star Wars” films that always depicted the dark side as more powerful. Yet while one character is ostensibly good and the other evil, they really occupy shades of gray between the two extremes represented in the previous trilogies. Both arrive in “Force Awakens” pining over relics of the past. Kylo worships his grandad Darth Vader’s mask, which Kylo refashions for himself, while Rey lives in the wreckage of past battles that dot the Jakku landscape. She dreams of glory, and it’s notable that she, like Kylo, dons her own mask, briefly putting on an old rebel fighter helmet. But although they arrive with contrasting motivations, they ultimately champion a desire to cast off the old guard and transcend the past. It’s partly why Kylo kills Han Solo in “Force Awakens” and Snoke in “Last Jedi.” It’s the ultimate effect of Rey’s sojourn to Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To in “Last Jedi” and, now, confronting Palpatine, the ancient Dark Lord of the Sith. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a fan-focused paean to “Star Wars” mythmaking. It’s largely simplistic and derivative, i.e. standard-issue Abrams. But just as Luke once saw a glimmer of good in his lost father, there’s a subversive core to this triumvirate that Abrams introduced and Johnson advanced. But you need to block out the congested, carbon-copied clamour.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019"," So begins the opening crawl to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and while it's clearly a reference to return of Palpatine, it could double as a meta description of the movie itself: The film features Carrie Fisher in a posthumous performance as Leia Organa, as first announced in 2018. Consisting primarily of unused footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Leia's appearances are clustered in about three main locations: very early in the movie, when she's training Rey; midway through, when she reaches out to Kylo Ren via the Force and dies as a result; and near the end, when a flashback to her post-Return of the Jedi youth reveals she once trained as a Jedi.  When Leia is onscreen, her presence feels slightly surreal. It's possible that moviegoers who don't go in with the knowledge that Fisher had died before this film started shooting won't notice the difference. Director J.J. Abrams and his team are extremely judicious about how much they show of her, and for how long, and from how close, and the results are far more convincing than the resurrected Tarkin or even the younger Leia in Rogue One.  But knowing what we know, it's difficult not to notice how generic and stilted her dialogue is. (""Never underestimate a droid"" becomes one of the character's most-quoted lines here, for no good reason.) Or how much of her body is in shadow at key moments. Or that her scenes don't really add up to a character arc befitting one of the franchise's most beloved characters.  They make the gracious choice to extend Leia's impact on the story by making it as much about what she represents as what she does. Leia becomes a symbol of hope and wisdom, an icon for the other characters to look up to. It's not unlike the way Fisher has been for us in our own world, and it allows the characters around Leia to become our surrogates, allowing us to say goodbye to our general and our princess one final time. Aliens we've never met talk about her, signaling that her reputation has spread to every corner of the galaxy. Lando wistfully asks Poe, Finn, and Rey to ""give Leia my love,"" and later shows up on the Resistance base to reminisce about their days as young Rebel fighters — you know, the ones we saw in the original trilogy. And Poe's battlefield speech in the climax invokes her name: ""Today we make our last stand for the galaxy. For Leia."" We're there in the more intimate interactions, too. Her handing of Luke's lightsaber to Rey is a literal passing of the torch. In their last embrace before Rey joins Poe and Finn on the search for the planet Exogol, we are Rey, tears slipping down our own faces as we say a reluctant goodbye to the woman we've loved for so long.  When Lieutenant Connix, played by Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd, offers physical support to a frail Leia, we wish we could have offered Fisher some comfort in her final moments. When Chewie stumbles with grief upon hearing of her passing, we recall how gutted we were to hear the news about Fisher. And when a troubled Poe sits by her body, confessing that he's afraid he's not ready, we are him, feeling a little less certain in a world without her. Step back a bit, and the truth is that Leia's journey here doesn't entirely make sense. Her decision to sacrifice herself for Kylo Ren feels unearned, and the logistics perplexing. Luke's explanation as to why Leia quit her Jedi training is unsatisfying, a half-baked resolution to an out-of-nowhere plot point. And why, exactly, is her lightsaber buried on Tatooine, a planet she primarily knew as the place where she was once enslaved by Jabba the Hutt? Most of all, it becomes apparent that what's missing is Leia's essential Leia-ness — that fearless attitude, that dry wit, that sly sex appeal, that sparkle of mischief in her eye. She's become a more anodyne version of herself, all the sweet and soft parts with too little of the spiky ones.  But then we remember that she's been a memory this whole time. Fisher wasn't present for any of the shooting of The Rise of Skywalker, and what this movie is missing of her and her character, no body double or digital tweaking could have provided. This is not a faithful reenactment of Leia but a memorial to her, a tribute of our own affection for her.  The real Leia, the one we fell in love with, lives on inside us as she always has. She still inspires us, amuses us, moves us. And we can visit her anytime we want, at the touch of a play button. Angie Han is the Deputy Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

"Dec 27, 2019"," This isn’t a knock on the groundbreaking franchise. Far from it. But the arrival of this weekend’s “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” promoted as the end of the Skywalker saga, comes with more relief than sadness. The latest trilogy began with an unimaginably emotional burst of nostalgia in 2015’s “The Force Awakens.” Seeing Han Solo and Chewbacca reunited with their Millennium Falcon and droid life partners C-3PO and R2-D2 together again brought, as the kids used to say, all the feels. But that was replaced by a divisive, ugly response to 2017’s “The Last Jedi.” It’s fair to say that sequel wasn’t everyone’s cup of Luke Skywalker’s green alien teat milk. But with the new film, “The Force Awakens” writer-director J.J. Abrams has set out to undo most everything progressive about Rian Johnson’s “Last Jedi” by de-emphasizing the decisions that spawned the most vitriol. Take Kelly Marie Tran’s refreshing Rose Tico. The character was hated by a small but vocal subset of the fandom — the same one that has an almost visceral resistance to characters of color who aren’t Lando Calrissian or Yoda — for being Asian, a woman or both. She’s barely along for the ride this time around. Abrams seems to have spent more time guessing what fans wanted than telling a cohesive story. For his troubles, #JJAbramsIsOverParty was trending on Twitter, less than 24 hours after the film’s world premiere, based on what angry “fans” had only heard about the movie. “The Rise of Skywalker” finds Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) racing to quell the latest threat to that galaxy far, far away. The overstuffed adventure makes for a reasonably satisfying conclusion to this trilogy, if not the nine-movie opus begun in 1977. That’s mostly thanks to some of the emotional beats and John Williams’ iconic score. The movie’s plot is almost instantly forgettable. The new characters — the lead trio plus Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren/Ben Solo — are serviceable enough, and they make perfectly suitable bridges from the past to the future, but they don’t have 40 years of memories at their backs. There’s simply little reason to care about them outside the context of the original stars. With Harrison Ford’s Han Solo and Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker having been taken off the board in previous installments — and Leia Organa mostly sidelined as a result of the untimely death of Carrie Fisher — the relative newbies are, more than ever, left to their own devices. Despite the actors’ best efforts, it’s difficult to care about the stakes or their characters’ fates. Now that this trilogy — the first since Disney purchased Lucasfilm in 2012 — has concluded, it’s clearly time to move on to other stories. Closing the door on the Skywalkers and focusing on wholly new tales could dampen some of the toxicity surrounding the franchise. Plus, it will just be creatively refreshing. Most of that is still up in the air, thanks to the disastrous reception to last year’s “Solo: A Star Wars Story.” That needless prequel caused Disney to pump the brakes on what had been envisioned as a new “Star Wars” movie every year until the end of time. For a while, there were so many spinoffs in the works, it looked for all the world as though we were destined for “That Blue Critter at the Cantina: A Star Wars Story.” With reactions so scattershot it can feel as though fans don’t even know what they want — not that servicing fans should ever be the primary goal of a filmmaker — Disney and Lucasfilm are taking a cautious approach to the next movie project. When “Game of Thrones” creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss walked away from their planned “Star Wars” trilogy in October, that left a trilogy from “The Last Jedi’s” Johnson and a stand-alone movie from Marvel mastermind Kevin Feige as the only films still believed to be in development. While the movie side is in disarray — the next offering isn’t expected before the end of 2022 at the earliest — the TV division is thriving. Disney Plus, the new behemoth streaming service, already has announced shows focusing on Ewan McGregor’s Obi-Wan Kenobi from the prequel trilogy and Diego Luna’s Cassian Andor from “Rogue One.” If the excitement of the streamer’s first dramatic series, “The Mandalorian,” and the collective freak-out over the show’s “Baby Yoda” is any indication, there’s plenty of The Force left in the “Star Wars” universe. Around 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be in place for the start of the rollout on Tuesday, a day that British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has reportedly dubbed as “V-Day,” a nod to triumphs in World War II.

"Dec 27, 2019"," Con Star Wars: el ascenso de Skywalker (Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, 2019) llega a su fin la tercera trilogía de Star Wars. ¿La saga también? Lo dudo. Si bien la franquicia, que ya daba serias muestras de adocenamiento (¿alcanzará la docena?), llega a este episodio con inocultables síntomas de agotamiento. No obstante, y para ser honesto, me resultó entretenida y terminó por entregarme más de lo que esperaba. Pues no esperaba mucho, para seguir siendo honesto. La historia me parece hasta cierto punto irrelevante, y la verdad es que tampoco me acuerdo de muchos detalles. Se trata de más de lo mismo. El héroe (ahora la heroína, como mandan los tiempos) debe ir del punto A al punto B para librar la batalla final de rigor. Siguiendo el librito de Joseph Campbell y su conocido planteamiento del camino del héroe, Rey (Daisy Ridley) rehúsa y luego acepta emprender la aventura; cruza el umbral de lo ordinario y en la ruta tiene aliados y enemigos, etcétera. Sobre todo tiene obstáculos, muchos obstáculos, los suficientes para llenar las más de dos horas de duración pero no los necesarios para tener un desarrollo temático atendible. Detrás de la cámara estuvo el realizador J.J. Abrams, quien empujó con solvencia a Star Trek y ahora firma su segunda entrega de la fuerza (fue el responsable de El despertar de la fuerza). Si bien es cierto que su registro de la acción es rutinario, su labor es solvente; con una puesta en cámara productiva y provechosa para dar agilidad al relato. La puesta en escena no es particularmente notable, y las coreografías en las peleas no provocan mucha emoción que digamos. En la banda sonora John Williams sale al quite: sigue imprimiendo fuerza a la fuerza, con diferentes tonos y las melodías conocidas. La ruta no sólo no elude el reciclamiento, sino que lo acoge con fruición: Abrams apela a cada rato a la nostalgia. Las hay de personajes –que pasaron a mejor vida y regresan a decir lo que aún tienen que decir–, de situaciones y de revelaciones al estilo de aquel “Yo soy tu padre” de Vader. El asunto pasa por la identidad (no recuerdo quién dijo que éste es el gran asunto de la literatura y el cine). Al final, de lo que se trata es de dar forma al “Yo”, trabajar por quién se quiere ser y no dejarse llevar por lo que podría definir la herencia o el ADN. Hay un llamado reiterado a la reflexión moral: el ser humano al final tiene la opción de hacer el bien (¿lo correcto?). Es cierto que cuesta más, pero ahí es donde ayuda la fuerza (de voluntad, para empezar). En algún momento se abre una ventana (¿ingenua?) a la esperanza y se trae a cuento aquello de “los buenos somos más”. Estos temas son oportunos y tienen relevancia, pertinencia (aunque tengo mis dudas sobre esto de “los buenos somos más”; cuando lo escucho invariablemente me pregunto: ¿más qué?, ¿más indiferentes?, ¿más abúlicos?). Pero, reitero, la historia no ayuda a generar mucha emoción como para hacer suficientemente significativo el mensaje. Si Star Wars tiene en su horizonte otra trilogía (y, reitero, no lo dudo), sería sensato apuntar a otras galaxias. Porque el ascenso de esta entrega (¿emulando al tercer rollo del Batman de Nolan?) sólo está en el título.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019","A sizable amount of the narrative of The Rise of Skywalker is spent specifically undoing what happened in The Last Jedi, and the result is a film that lacks forward momentum.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 27, 2019"," First comes the brassy blast of John Williams' iconic theme—hurtling at you from 42 years in the past and from a galaxy far, far away. Then, the first words in the title crawl of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. ""The dead speak!"" An enervating part of the Star Wars religion is the way the dearly departed keep coming back as blue-tinted ghosts—as in Return of the Jedi, when old Obi Wan joined the teddy bear picnic of Ewoks from the next world. The grave never seems to be able to hold either the characters or the actors who play them, such as Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. When the filmmakers mean us to feel sorry about an already demised actor dying on screen, it's like that glitch in Facebook's algorithms that reprints a person's obituary on the anniversary of their death. It's sad, and news to some, but it lacks surprise.  Moreover, The Rise of Skywalker violates a sacred law of good filmmaking—that is waiting to show the monster until the end of the movie. From the crawl, we know that Emperor Palpatine (quavery old Ian McDiarmid) has come back to life. He's resurrected and needs to be snuffed. Thus, we know where this movie will end. Him and the final order (a football stadium full of hooded faceless cheerers-on) hide on a grim, bad planet, punctuated by streaks of blue lightning. It's a Sith stronghold that can only be found with a triangular widget, which in turn can only be found with the help of an inscription on a blade, written in the dread tongue of Mordor (actually Sithese), which C3P0 is forbidden to utter. And we know that the last of the Jedi, the one-named Rey (Daisy Ridley—sometimes beautifully fierce, sometimes blandly intrepid) must be the spearhead.  The Rise of Skywalker has the disadvantage of following The Last Jedi, maybe the best in the series; during lag times in this J.J. Abrams vehicle, one recalls the energy Rian Johnson brought to the lightsaber fight in Snoke's crimson throne room, and the groans of the grizzled Chewbacca, and the closeups of Adam Driver's vaguely teenage face swollen with emotion. Kylo Ren helps this film. One enjoys the mournfulness of this would-be villain, and how this grandfather-worshipping warrior is like Napoleon III, floundering violently in the shade of his famous uncle, the real Napoleon. Kylo is now delicately scarfaced, and his shattered helmet has been repaired, kintsugi style, with some veins of crimson metal. The Rise of Skywalker's most compelling motif is the relationship between him and Rey, the woman he loves and hates and can't stop pulling a lightsaber on. The two are so bonded that they're in each other's heads. They share separate spaces at the same time; in one fight, she's on a spaceship and he's in a marketplace; he swings his saber and bursts open a bag of beans, and the beans roll at her feet, many miles away. Their more or less climactic duel takes place atop the rusting ruins of the Death Star, surrounded by a turbulent sea. But there's plenty of rudderless action as the rest of the characters make a crowded, yet uneventful, chase from one planet to another. The Rise of Skywalker seems to lose track of everyone, particularly the becalmed rebels where a digitally reconstructed Leia (Fisher) waits for news. Kelly Marie Tran's Rose—who refreshed The Last Jedi—is put in the corner. C3P0 risks lobotomy in a scene with no payoff; Chewbacca becomes a hostage for a while, and then he isn't. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaacs) are given underling dialogue as well as the company of a pair of women warriors (Kerry Russell and Naomi Ackie) with whom they don't spend enough time. There's constant eye candy: a Kumba Mehla-style celebration in the desert called ""The Festival of the Ancestors"" (which the movie certainly is), a six-eyed sandworm attack and various growling muppets. Yet nothing much connects: the threats during a final duel, blasted with CGI lightning, sound like the taunts of children on a playground trying to top each other. This was once a series that did things that no other movie franchise could; the best thing you can say about it now is that it's finally wrapped up.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2019"," Star Wars has been a part of my life for longer than I’ve been watching the films. I may have started with The Phantom Menace, but I was almost always familiar with the mythology of the universe. After watching The Rise of Skywalker, the film that is meant to end the Skywalker saga, I had to sit with myself and ask why do I dislike this movie so much and love The Last Jedi, despite both films sidelining Finn and playing with expectations from film to film. Why am I able to see one as a great Star Wars movie in spite of it and one as a mess? The answer comes down to one thing: I think I see Star Wars closer to Rian Johnson’s vision more than J.J. Abrams’s. Growing up with the prequels first, my interpretation of the Jedi is that they are corrupt space cops. As a child, I remember being deeply upset that Anakin was being forced to leave his mother as a young boy and told to forget her. Since I was around the same age as the character, all I could think of was the loneliness and sadness that I would feel from that experience. “The Jedi are mean,” I remember saying to my mom after the movie. And I still feel that way. Yet The Rise of Skywalker tries to undo the harsh gut-punch examination that the Jedi were not perfect. I loved Luke telling Rey in The Last Jedi that the legacy of the Jedi is of failure because, in many ways, it is. The Jedi ripped away children from their families, and told a young boy to forget his mother, to push down his feelings and to not love. As Pop Culture Detective breaks down, while not always perfect, the prequels paint a picture of an order so wrapped in dogma, that it ends up teaching toxic lessons to Anakin. It was Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda who attempted to manipulate Luke into killing his own father, by keeping that information from him. A choice that was wrong, because it was Luke calling out for his father in pain that made Anakin/Vader turn. Not murder. In fact, you could make the case that Luke’s fear of Ben Solo in The Last Jedi is based around the flaws within the Jedi order itself. This is why The Rise of Skywalker deciding to just play everything straight about the Sith and the Jedi is ultimately so boring for me as a fan. Also, I got older (and gayer), I found myself really rejecting the binary of good and evil that seemed to be so key to the Force mythology that we are taught. Even if we look at the dualism that it is based around, like the concept of Yin and Yang, it is not that these two forces are in conflict constantly, but that they are “complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world, and how they may give rise to each other as they interrelate to one another.” Basically you need both. In the old Legends, there were also examples of Sith and Jedi working together. For example, Darth Vectivus, known as the Sith Lord who did no evil. He simply learned and had enough balance and self-control within himself to remained balance while being a Sith. That is interesting.  Kylo Ren could have been another Skere Kaan, a Jedi Master turned Sith leader who ends up creating disorder within the Dark Side of the Sith. Or Darth Gravid, who tried to combine Sith and Jedi teachings and ends up losing his mind as a result. Basically, the relationship between the Jedi and the Sith is more interesting than Emperor Palpatine/Sidious and the Skywalker family. I love the mythology of Star Wars and I love how Lucas in the prequels tried to give us a more nuanced vision of the Jedi, even if he did it in a flawed way. J.J. Abrams’s vision seems to have a built-in disdain for the questions the prequels raised about the morality of the Jedi. Which is fine, but I prefer the morally grey areas that I saw in Johnson’s vision. It wasn’t perfect, but it wasn’t so reverent to the past that it couldn’t ask how would these realities affect the characters today. Star Wars is amazing, but I am not a traditionalist when it comes to the story. I like the meta-questions, I like the mythology, and I feel like, for me, the series has outgrown the straight hero’s journey that it started with many years ago. In the end, I think one thing is fundamentally true about this sequel trilogy: the fact that they went in without a three-movie plan, directors who were communicating, and a story bible is a damn sin.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2019"," 
The first hour is virtually unwatchable, fast and furious but with no editing flow and no sense of purpose other than to simply get you to the next part. Fans going in looking for answers or meaningful storytelling will not only be bewildered, but blindingly pissed off. It's pretty clear that Abrams and friends had no real plans when they laid out this latest trilogy. They are making this crap up as they go along.
 
Force Awakens, also directed by Abrams, was a promising start. Heck, I will call it a classic. Then, The Last Jedi happened, with Rian Johnson getting permission to go off the reservation with his storytelling, and he most certainly did. Some of the plotting choices in Jedi were odd, but at least that movie was a decent film that felt like a Star Wars movie, peppered with some laughably bad moments.
 
After Awakens, Disney and Abrams made the bold choice to hand the storytelling over to Johnson for Jedi (not unlike Lucas giving up directing control for the original trilogy), and then they second-guessed their own bravery. The Rise of Skywalker is an unabashed Abrams apology for ""missteps"" of The Last Jedi, rendering the second film as a complete joke, and doing everything it can to win back the fans that may've gotten disenchanted. Continuity be damned.
 
My advice is to pretend this movie hasn't happened. Allow hologram Luke Skywalker facing down Kylo Ren in Jedi to be the end of the ""Skywalker Saga"" and skip this one. Watch the superior The Mandalorian and the soul healing powers of Baby Yoda on Disney+, along with the upcoming Obi Wan series as your Star Wars fix.

"Dec 26, 2019"," When it comes to “Star Wars,” being a fan comes first and a film critic comes second. I was four years old when I saw the original, and I’ve been a huge devotee of all things in the galaxy for forty plus years. This isn’t a review written by a disgruntled fan, as I have grown to love Rey, Poe, and BB-8 almost as much as Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and R2-D2. But when a movie is so careless with its beloved characters both past and present, it’s something that can’t be ignored. The Skywalker saga comes to its disappointing end in this (supposedly) final chapter. The recycled story is basic and mostly predictable, as the surviving Resistance rallies together to face the First Order for one final battle. So much is shoved into this movie that it feels like a pressure cooker that’s being forced to tell a too-rushed story. It becomes frustrating early on. I realize “Star Wars” is a touchy subject and fans will always be debating the films until the end of time, but “The Rise of Skywalker” is one of the more mediocre entries in the series. From the reveal of Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) origins to the head-scratching actions of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to the disappointing conclusions for Hux (Domhnall Gleeson), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe’s (Oscar Isaac) stories, this thing stinks to high heaven. Almost everyone does things that are totally out of character, events happen that make absolutely no sense within the Lucas-created universe, it seems like more questions are raised than are answered, and new rules of what the Jedi can and can’t do seem to be made up on the fly because they make for convenient story arcs. I’m not usually a literal filmgoer but this movie is so poorly plotted that its myriad problems are too abundant to ignore. Since this is a spoiler-free review I can’t divulge them here, but those who’ve seen the film will be able to name at least half of the dozen or so massive problems within seconds. Particularly shameful is the inexcusable way Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who was a major character in “The Last Jedi,” is discarded like trash and relegated to a very minor background role in this film. Perhaps a defense could be constructed that she didn’t quite fit into this part of the journey, but I say hogwash. This is absolutely a decision that feels like it was done to appease angry internet fanboys who screamed and howled about Tran and her character behind the anonymity of their keyboards. Kowtowing to bullies is a colossal setback to the very themes that root the “Star Wars” franchise. Further aggravating to life-long fans is the sparse emotional connection that stems from the film’s many fakeouts. There are zero consequences to the movie’s most shocking moments. It’s a crappy thing to do because it assures a near-complete loss of trust from your audience. For every gasp-inducing jolt and hold-for-tears touching moment, a sense of betrayal almost always follows. Even worse is the quality of the filmmaking. This movie is so poorly shot it’s shocking, and director J.J. Abrams, who did a terrific job with “The Force Awakens,” is again in the driver’s seat. Only this time instead of keeping an unflappable composure behind the wheel, he’s swerving in and out of traffic at such a high speed that he spins out of control and careens off the nearest cliff. Yikes! I made a joke on Facebook recently that “as a lifelong Star Wars fan, I am looking forward to seeing “Cats” this weekend.”  I wasn’t planning on seeing “Cats” but ending up seeing it out of sheer morbid curiosity and having time to kill. Still haven’t seen “The Rise of Skywalker” yet. I’ll see RoS soon, but do hate everything I’ve read about it. This new saga had managed the tough job of introducing so many likeable and diverse heroes, only to let them down at the end. Too many cooks do spoil the broth! I agree withyour two star rating. While the plot and storyline seems too much and in a pressure cooker, the movie seemed a bit too long, too many fight scenes, jokes falling flat (I heard rarely any, if at all, reactions from the audience), not well filmed, and somewhat dull. Wait until it’s out on DVD or TV.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2019","An entertaining, yet disappointing finale to the Skywalker saga. [Full review in Spanish}",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2019"," A message is transmitted through space: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), ruler of the once-defeated Empire, has somehow survived certain death and now threatens the galaxy again. While the First Order’s Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) races to hunt Palpatine down, members of the Resistance – Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Finn (John Boyega) – launch a last-ditch effort to finally defeat the First Order. The Rise of Skywalker is the third and final film in Walt Disney’s sequel trilogy to George Lucas’ famous Star Wars saga. It also acts as the ninth film in Lucas’ saga overall, forming the culmination of a triple trilogy of epic adventure in which two out of five members of the Skywalker family turn out so murderously evil that the galaxy would have been better off had Qui-Gon Jinn offed little Anakin in his sleep all the way back in 1999’s The Phantom Menace. My first and primary recommendation on The Rise of Skywalker is this: don’t bother watching unless you have already done your homework. This is a film entirely concerned, and understandably so, with closing doors and putting toys back into their box. Does this mean Star Wars is done for good? Of course not, but it hopefully does mean a proper expansion of its fictional universe beyond the Skywalkers. Writer/director J.J. Abrams was given an unwinnable battle with this film. He directed the first of Disney’s sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens, and in keeping with his television works Alias and Lost he packed it with open-ended questions and mysteries. Who was this mysterious young woman Rey, abandoned by her parents on a desert planet and inexplicably drawn to the Force? How did Anakin Skywalker’s lightsaber, lost by his son Luke – along with a hand – on the planet Bespin, wind up abandoned in a chest in a storage room in the bowels of a jungle planet bar? Who was the mysterious Supreme Leader Snoke, a scarred alien gifted in the dark side of the Force, and how did he seduce Han Solo and Leia Organa’s son Ben? Why did Luke Skywalker hide himself away on a distant planet rather than fight to save the galaxy from the new Empire-in-all-but-name First Order? It was Rian Johnson who wrote and directed The Force Awaken‘s sequel The Last Jedi, and given free rein chose to answer precisely one of those questions. The answer he gave – that Luke had abandoned the Jedi Order after almost killing his nephew Ben – displeased an entire section of Star Wars’ most ardent fans. Other questions he not only failed to answer on Abrams’ terms, but entirely deflated: Rey is told her parentage is dull and ignominious, and Snoke is unexpectedly killed off to render any questions over his origins moot. The true focus of The Last Jedi was the subversion and ultimate democratization of Star Wars mythology, making it very clear that anybody could be a hero and that being a Skywalker was not particularly special. It unshackled Star Wars from its back story and opened it up to enormous creative possibilities. While an admirable goal, it did so an entire film too early, and that left Abrams with a ninth film that was arguably narratively redundant and with a noisy sub-section of the fanbase throwing tantrums all over the Internet. That this review has run more than 500 words to address two earlier films is ultimately the strongest explanation of why The Rise of Skywalker turns out to be an unholy mess. It does remain a broadly enjoyable film, with pitch-perfect sequences resonating with earlier films and various elements drawing in an enormous amount of nostalgia. At the same time it is too long, weirdly paced, and overwhelmingly too busy. Essentially, however, with The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi clashing so badly with one another in content and style – and it’s important to stress that I deeply enjoyed both of them, this was still and always going to be the final film that we were going to get. Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio take what they must from The Last Jedi. Luke and Snoke remain dead. The First Order remains ascendant. They otherwise not only discard Johnson’s film but actively seem to beat it up via dialogue. Significant moments of character development are abandoned: Luke’s Obi-Wan-style ghost apologises to Rey for being wrong. Kylo Ren has his helmet rebuilt. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), the best new character of Last Jedi, is sidelined to near-cameo status in what looks too much like a concession to the sexist sub-group of fans that complained about her presence so much in the first place. Her budding romance with Finn is also dropped, with the latter returning to his Force Awakens pining after Rey. It feels like a back-and-forth act of franchise sabotage: Rian Johnson flies in the face of Abrams’ narrative arc, so Abrams returns and renders Johnson’s film all-but-irrelevant. What is developed in its place is one of the messiest and most-rushed blockbuster films I can remember seeing. Palpatine has returned, with all of the logic and explanation of Ralph Wiggum in The Simpsons‘ Bible stories episode (“Ralph, I thought you were dead!” “Nope!”). Before the viewer has had a chance to settle down, Kylo Ren is already tracking down and confronting the former Emperor, Rey is being trained in the Jedi arts by Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), and Finn, Poe, and Chewbacca are racing around the galaxy gathering intelligence while fleeing the First Order’s TIE Fighters. The film opens at a breakneck pace, and runs with such ferocity that by the halfway point it feels like the audience has already seen two-and-a-half film’s worth of plot. One imagines there is a four-hour rough cut sitting somewhere in a vault, since one cannot imagine a film this fast and vague was deliberately made. The theatrical cut reeks of savage edits and emergency reshoots. The few sequences featuring Carrie Fisher are awkwardly cut around deleted scenes from The Force Awakens and feel deeply uncomfortable to watch. Despite its significant faults, The Rise of Skywalker ultimately provides an entertaining two-and-a-half hours in the cinema and wrap up the so-called Skywalker Saga with plenty of emotional moments. I am not convinced that J.J. Abrams can plot a narrative, but he can direct the hell out of a scene. The film hits numerous beats that provide wonderful little bursts of enjoyment, to enough of an extent that – assuming the viewer keeps their overall expectations in check – it provides a fun sort of theme park ride. One skill he has demonstrated in spades is an ability to cast a film well: Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley in particular act the hell out of their scenes together, while their broad supporting cast is packed with the likes of Richard E. Grant, Domnhall Gleeson, Billy Dee Williams (returning as Lando Calrissian from The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi), and Ian McDiarmid. The actors paper over a lot of the cracks left in the script, while the treasure hunt storyline offers plenty of opportunities for action sequences, chase scenes, and lightsaber fights. The production design and photography is pure eye candy. John William’s final-ever film score is predictably excellent. The screenplay is broadly speaking terrible, but the cast and crew at least work hard to give the film a quality shine. Describing The Rise of Skywalker as a good film is to be overly charitable, but it is easier to describe it as a fun one. Spaceships fly around. People exchange gunfire in pitched battles. Good battles evil, and destinies are resolved. This Disney-backed sequel trilogy has been a rough and uneven ride, but it has entertained us pretty well over the past five years – and with the Skywalker soap opera now tidily underway, it will be interesting to see where Disney takes the saga next.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 25, 2019"," It’s been four years since Star Wars’ sequel trilogy began with J.J. Abrams‘ The Force Awakens and 42 years since the franchise began with George Lucas’ A New Hope in 1977. Now, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is closing out the titular Skywalker saga. Directed by Abrams and written by Abrams and Chris Terrio, The Rise of Skywalker has debuted to mixed reactions from critics and fans alike. With the weight of taking over from another director following 2017’s The Last Jedi, and closing out multiple generations of film, our contributors have a lot to say on the film. Some love, some aren’t moved, and some can’t wait for the next step in the franchise. Find out what they have to say below. Kate: I just wanted to feel hope. Because I didn’t like the Last Jedi and how ostracizing the fallout of that film felt, I went in and just wanted to experience Star Wars for myself. As for characters, I just wanted Finn and Poe to get their due. Nikko: I knew that if it went in with any actual expectations, I would let them shape the way I thought about the film. But I was still very excited to see it.  Swara: I went in hoping for a compelling hero’s journey for Rey, Finn, Poe, and for a well-done redemption arc for Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. Overall, I am very satisfied on those counts.  Eva: I went in incredibly anxious but had no real expectations. I was hoping that I’d come out of it in love and feeling hopeful but I was nervous that it would feel superficial. Cidnya: I wanted nothing more but an original and thoughtful ending to a series I have loved all my life. I wanted Rey, Finn, and Poe to find themselves and give us hope.  Aaron: I was extremely excited about going into the movie. The trailers had highlighted some really sharp contrasts from the brightness of the Pasana festival to the foreboding darkness Exegol. My main worry was about they were planning on including the Emperor without it feeling rushed or unplanned. Maia: I tried very hard not to think about the movie or the saga going in because I didn’t want to get my hopes up or get too attached to any theory and end up being ultimately disappointed. Kristen Bates: I expected an exciting conclusion to this new Star Wars trilogy. My hopes were that The Rise of Skywalker would answer lingering questions while creating new stories we could explore after the ending. I was also excited about the new Force abilities that J.J. Abrams hinted about in previous interviews.  Kate: Poe. Hands down. I finally feel like he got to shine with his friends after not being able to share screentime with them the last film. He’s confident, he’s courageous and in The Rise of Skywalker, he asks for help. He leans on his best friend Finn. He’s a general. He is just spectacular, emotional and brash. Lizzy: Poe. Poe’s character was the only thing I really loved about this movie. He finally got the attention he deserved. Of the new characters introduced, Poe has consistently been my favorite because of his relationship with Leia, Finn, and his classic flyboy attitude.  Swara: As it was for The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, it was Rey. Each film has given her unique challenges, and here was no different as she discovered more about her past and what she needed to do to defeat Palpatine. Daisy Ridley gave her best performance of the trilogy. Adrian: Finn. He is the purest character in the movie who at this point knows who is and loves the Resistance and his place in the series. He loves harder than anyone in the series and deserves in happiness in the world. Eva: This is the toughest question ever because it is hands down a tie between C-3PO and Kylo Ren. C-3PO because I’ve always loved that anxiety robot and he really shined in this one but Kylo Ren’s redemption hit me so hard out of nowhere. I’d hated him the whole trilogy but his talk with Han, turn to the light side, and total dedication to defeating the Emperor transformed him into my favorite dude out of all three sequels movies. Cidnya: Poe Dameron has been my favorite character throughout the whole series. He finally shined in this film as the strong and willful person I wanted to see more of compared to The Last Jedi. His strength and sense of camaraderie were both infectious and inspiring.  Aaron: It has to be Rey. From The Force Awakens to The Last Jedi, and now finally to The Rise of Skywalker she has encountered insurmountable obstacles and overcome each of them. She grew up with no family to care nor guide for her. Yet Rey fights through adversity consistently. Seeing her grow in this film was really gratifying. Additionally, the film did an excellent job in highlighting Rey’s newly acquired force abilities from the saber toss, to the force jumps, and even force healing, it was everything I wanted to see from Rey in this film! Maia: Chewbacca. 250 years old and seeing almost all of his friends die but he’s still out here supporting the kids and fighting for what’s right. The grief and joy Joonas instilled into those roars did Peter Mayhew proud.  CJ: I definitely love what happened with Poe in this film. He’s taking up the mantle of acting General for the Resistance, asking Finn to help him, and leading the troops into battle was a great moment. Rey is a close second because she deals with so much in this movie and it doesn’t corrupt or darkens her soul. Kristen Bates: I’ve always felt a personal connection with Rey. Her desire for something more and willingness to adapt to her surroundings drew me to her during The Force Awakens. Now, with this reveal of what she had to fight against, Rey became my favorite character for The Rise of Skywalker. To me, Star Wars is about the hero’s journey. Finn, Poe and Rey all experienced their own hero’s journey but I absolutely enjoyed Rey’s path.  Kate: I’ve seen The Rise of Skywalker twice now, and it’s when Poe thinks that the First Order might be right. They might be alone, and if they are, he failed the Resistance. Then, with tears in his eyes, he hears Lando, and the hope of the film is restored. A close second though, are the beautifully choreographed lightsaber fight scenes between Kylo Ren and Rey, specifically when they’re on the moon in the Endor system in the middle of the water. Nikko: By far my favorite part was the scene where Poe goes to talk with Leia after she died. The scene was full of emotion that definitely got to me in ways I never expected.  Lizzy: I loved seeing Poe, Finn, and Rey together. The three of them working together to escape the stormtroopers after arriving on Pasaana in hopes of finding the Sith Wayfinder was my favorite.  Swara: My favorite sequence was the entirety of the Death Star II wreckage scenes. Here we got a fantastic and raw emotional battle between Rey and Kylo that culminated in some of the film’s most pivotal moments. I also loved Finn’s discovery of his Force sensitivity.  Adrian: Really, really hard to pick one. I averaged a 99 heart rate through the movie so I was invested throughout. However, when Finn is searching for his two friends while everyone is embracing and finally finds his friends show how much he is the heart of the Resistance.  Eva: Like Swara, I think my favorite part was Kylo and Rey duking it out on the Death Star because it was when I started to root for Kylo. Even though he was still evil at that point (though not for long), there was a genuine feeling of caring that I hadn’t felt from him before and his continued shock at what Rey was doing and the path she was going down was super relatable. Cidnya: I very much enjoyed seeing Poe, Finn, Rey, Chewie, BB-8, and C390 adventuring together. The action sequences they were featured in was light-hearted and fun. They really proved that they are a family when Chewie was captured and they all went to go rescue him. It was fast and fun, giving me all my favorite aspects of Star Wars.  Aaron: Chewie getting his medal. Such a small detail to add, but given it was being passed on by Leia, aided by Carrie Fisher’s untimely passing, it was such a heartwarming moment. I grew up on the original trilogy, so to see Chewie finally be recognized for his achievements all these years, it gave me the feels! Maia: When Lando shows up and Poe, Finn, and Rey are all starstruck and we got that hint of Luke and Lando backstory that needs to be elaborated on ASAP! Give us old men searching through space for lost children and Sith Wayfinders stat! Also when Snap Wexley died. The evil has been defeated! But actually it’s Rey physically rising up against Palpatine with the power of the Jedi behind her.  CJ: When Rey hears all the voices of The Last Jedi and stands up to Palpatine. It reinforced Luke’s statement that a thousand generations lived in her and it was beautiful to hear all those familiar voices. Kristen Bates: I loved seeing Rey’s lightsaber at the end and Rey declaring herself a Skywalker. It solidified the idea that it doesn’t matter where you come from as long as you are willing to do something bigger than yourself. I also enjoyed the moment that Ben had with Han Solo where he got to do the right thing and go back to his dad.  Kate: Most of the issues I have with this film comes from what I wanted that only could have been addressed in adding more to the second film. I want more Maz, but more time doesn’t fit in here, and I want more Leia, but with Carrie Fisher’s passing, this was all they could do. But ultimately, I truly wish that there was no kiss. Romance has felt extremely out of place in the sequel trilogy. With Rose kissing Finn last film and now a kiss to end this one, it just doesn’t fit. There is intimacy and bonding beyond romance, no matter what shippers say. This isn’t even commenting on the issues brought up by women in the fandom about having yet another abusive relationship at the center of one of the trilogies. That said, no kiss, no problem. Nikko: The pacing of the film was really fast. I wanted to like the new characters that were introduced in this film but I didn’t see them get enough screen time to form any real opinions. I don’t like the explanation they gave of Rey’s lineage, but I still thought the overall concept was great. Even though I’m not a fan of Rose, her character definitely got the spotlight taken off of her. If anything, this film made me care even less about her. The final scene felt a little too much like Avengers Endgame. I fully expected for Rey to say “And I am Iron Man” instead of “And I am the Jedi.” Also, and I know I’m going to get a lot of flack for this, but the kiss between Rey and Ben was COMPLETELY unnecessary.  Lizzy: I hated the romances. They all felt forced. Rey kissing Kylo, a man who has gaslit her through the entire series, was very disappointing. Additionally, I didn’t feel any chemistry between Oscar Isaac’s Poe and Kerri Russel’s Zorri Bliss. As cool as Zorri looked, her addition felt so unnecessary and like the filmmakers decided last minute they really needed to give Poe a love interest, decided Finn being right there. I also hated the “gay representation” in the movie. Two background characters kissing for less than five seconds is not representation.  Swara: This film has me very conflicted. When I don’t think critically about it, I absolutely loved it. When I think more deeply about some of the things it did, and how it did so, I recognize its flaws. For example, I’ve longtime theorized Rey Palpatine and cheered in the theater when it was revealed. However, it’s ultimately just my fan theory that doesn’t make sense when strung together, and seems to renege the message of The Last Jedi that you don’t have to be of a “royal bloodline” (in this case literally) to be a Jedi. It wasn’t necessary. However, Finn’s reveal of being Force-Sensitive seems to bolster this message from The Last Jedi, so perhaps JJ Abrams tried to play it both ways. I also echo Charles. The pacing was way too fast, and it cluttered so many plot points together. Trying to do so much at once, it was hard to maintain focus, and the film suffered for it. Adrian: No kiss and the movie is perfect for me. I can explain all of the issues in the movie with other expanded material except for the kiss. However, if I lived through Anakin-Padme through the prequel trilogy and Luke kissing his sister I can take Reylo to be honest. Eva: Boy, do not get me started. PREQUELS? WHERE ARE THEY? Y’all really gonna wrap up the Skywalker saga and not give me a real nod to Anakin Skywalker or mention Padme’s name or let Obi-Wan show up to be like “hello there Rey, let’s talk about the Force.” Come on J.J. I’m so disappointed. I will have a whole article on this written, do not worry, but the prequel disrespect was absolutely heartbreaking. The thing that bothers me the most is Rey showing up on Tattooine, taking the name Skywalker, two feet from Shmi Skywalker’s grave, and the only Skywalkers that show up are Luke and Leia? For real? Where’s Anakin and Shmi and Ben Solo who just sacrificed his life to save you? Bro. You can’t just take two out of five Skywalkers. Disrespectful. Cidnya: I agree with everything Lizzy mentioned. The inclusion of Rey kissing Ben Solo, the newly turned good Kylo, feels like pandering to Reylo shippers. Ben, up until that point, had a very solid redemption arch that felt satisfying. However, that kiss cheapens both Ben and Rey rendering them as a forced, 2-second romance that did not need to happen.  Aaron: Much like me fellow contributors I think the pacing was off. However, it’s ultimately a small gripe that stems from a bigger issue that lands on the doorstep of LucasFilm. The decision to pump out films in such a quick turn around, which in turn caused two different directors to take on the franchise led to Abrams then having to tie up plot lines from The Force Awakens. Had Abrams taken on the whole trilogy I think this movie would have paced fair better. Due to this, there were a lot of things introduced without better set up i.e. the Knights of Ren, Zorii Bliss, even Palpatine himself. Moving forward Lucas needs to focus on their trilogy films with a grander sense in mind resulting in a more focused story. Maia: There have been a lot of recent threads about sff writers tossing in a poorly thought out romance into their books with no knowledge of the romance genre and how to make them actually good romances instead of afterthoughts and it’s a real shame the writers of the Sequel Trilogy never read those because that’s exactly how every romance over these three movies felt. Romance is NOT easy to write and not something you can just shoehorn into a story and expect it to flow well. Justice for the forehead kiss!  CJ: Good god why did Rey kiss Ben? WHY?! SO GROSS! It should’ve been Finn. Also, Finn should have told Rey he loved her (that’s what he intended to say, you can’t change my mind.) Nikko and Charlie are also right, the film needed 20-30 more minutes and to slow the hell down in the first act. Kristen Bates: I really wanted more of Rose’s story. The Last Jedi introduced us to this fantastic character with so much potential for a beautiful story arc and we only got a few lines from her in The Rise of Skywalker. I was hoping for more. Perhaps we will get a Rose Tico story on Disney Plus.  Kate: The Rise of Skywalker was beautiful ending. The film drives home the meaning of the sequel trilogy: you’re more than where you come from. The sequel trilogy is about taking the power inside of you and choosing what to do with it. It’s about defecting from the First Order, fighting against the bloodline you’re tied to, and ultimately it’s about forging your own path, not the one someone lays out for you. That is powerful and that closed it out perfectly. Nikko: I think it’s the closest thing we’ll get to a good ending. I can’t imagine how they could’ve wrapped this up in any other way.  Lizzy: I think the last scene with Rey burying Luke and Leia’s lightsaber to then show her own is about as good as I can ask for. I have issues with the movie, that ending is not necessarily one of them.  Swara: I thought the last scene was poignant and conveyed the continuation of the adventure that Rey and her friends will have going forward. They are inspired by those who came before but are still making it their own (hence the distinctive yellow lightsaber). Eva: The rational part of my brain says it was fine and good. The irrational part of my brain is furious that a Skywalker didn’t kill Palpatine. But also the narrative of found-family is a good one. Who knows. I’m very conflicted about this movie. Cidnya: Realistically, I wasn’t sure how I wanted this saga to end. The closing scene of Rey paying homage to Luke and Leia Skywalker is as good as I could have imagined. Filling me with hope and reminding me that, as Rey, I will always look up to them.  Aaron: I’m not sure it’ll ever end. I would love to see more from these characters. I’ve also lived long enough to know that in Star Wars nothing is ever over. As a bookend to the sequel trilogy, however, it was every bit as climatic as I hoped it would. Rey’s Jedi abilities were on full show and it was kick-ass!! Maia: It was chaotic and full of holes and hope and love and exactly right to close out the Skywalker Saga. I loved how neatly it wrapped up the Skywalker story while showing unequivocally that family is more than just the name you’re born with. CJ: It made me tear up. Mainly because Rey chose the family who was there for her, and carries on the legacy of Luke and Leia. Kristen Bates: The Rise of Skywalker was a great end to the saga. It drew on the themes of family and hope in the Star Wars universe. As long as you have hope, there’s a chance for the light to win.  Kate: Legacy, and how we move past what life gives us. Leia was more than a princess, Luke was more than a farmer, and Rey…Rey is more than all of us. Kristen Bates: Anyone can be a Skywalker. It is a symbol of hope. Not just hope that good will win but hope that one can be redeemed. Our contributors were split, with some calling high praise, others landing in the meh area.

"Dec 24, 2019"," Eight films, 20 hours and hundreds of nostalgic moments have lead up to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and the final film in the franchise has the impossible task of wrapping up a fleet of story lines in a mere few hours. It’s almost too much for a single film to juggle, and not even the Force can pull it off. Which is a shame because America needs Star Wars now more than ever. When George Lucas made A New Hope in 1977, it was in response to the country’s tumultuous times. It was nice for audiences to see the good guys win after we lost the Vietnam War, and it was a chance to escape to a galaxy far, far away for a nation dealing with uncertainty in the wake of Watergate. Now, there are headlines about scandals, shootings or acts of terrorism every day. We all sort of feel like we need rescuing, don’t we? In the Star-verse, Rey (Daisy Ridley) represents the universal hero. She’s the last Jedi and the last hope for the Resistance. Now a Moses-like figure armed with a literal staff, Rey has made it her life’s mission to part the Red Sea that is the Sith. That means dueling Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Supreme Leader of the bad guys. It also means going up against the hooded Emperor Palpatine, who has been in hiding for decades. Director J.J. Abrams keeps things moving at light speed. From one swashbuckling adventure to the next, Rey and her friends zip from planet to planet looking for clues of Palpatine’s existence. Poe Dameron, the vivacious pilot played by Oscar Isaac, is flying everyone around in the Millennium Falcon. Along for the ride: Finn, the stormtrooper turned good guy (John Boyega), the iconic warm-spirited grizzly beast Chewbacca (voiced by Joonas Suatamo), the biting and beloved C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and BB-8, the cute robot who rolls around aimlessly. Together, they stand against the dark side that threatens to wipe out all that is good in the galaxy. That’s pretty much the premise of every Star Wars movie, but the stakes here are more consequential, and the picture’s scope is monumental. You don’t have to be a fan of the series to enjoy the lightsaber duels and dog fights in space, either. One spectacular scene sees Rey and Ren trading lightsaber blows on a windswept coast, as the backwash of towering waves shower over their intense faces. Another scene memorable for its galactic scale comes toward the end of the run time- a thousand Resistance space ships go to war against even more Star Destroyers in a winner-take-all battle for the ages. While The Rise of Skywalker has no shortage of spectacular set pieces, it’s still missing the magic that made A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi landmarks of pop culture. Lucas’ original trilogy brought out the child in all of us. Everywhere audiences looked there was something new to see, and Lucas paced those films so that we could stop and take everything in before moving on to the next planet. Here, Abrams moves things along way too fast. Every minute he cuts to a new planet. And there are so many new and old characters coming and going that it unfolds like an intergalactic bus station. And some of the stops are better than others. Whenever Ridley and Driver share the screen, the dramatic force between them is palpable. Rey sees the good beneath Ren’s cracked mask, while he sees the darkness brooding under her bright smile. Through the performances, their attempts to change one another’s sides recalls the intensity of Darth Vadar trying to turn his son Luke Skywalker against his friends. If there’s anything clever in the script, it’s the way it reflects the divide between good and evil in everyone, a duality that’s more complex than black and white, and which was the basis for the original. Other than Ridley and Driver’s chemistry, though, there isn’t a lot to like here or feel awed about. The enterprise is too cluttered to be breezy. It’s too caught up in trying to please fans, so there’s no risk or revelatory ideas on screen. This can be credited to the waves of negative feedback that Disney received after Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi. Hardcore fans hated the way Johnson added his own creative flourishes to the picture. In The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams has clearly decided to leave out any traces of individuality or creativity, as to not upset the hardcore fanbase. Though the pop culture status quo might be satisfied here, those who judge the film on its own merits or the potential the final series showed for greatness -building on the original rather than bilking it- will not be. During the climax, Rey, the protagonist of the final trilogy, declares, “If we fail, it was all for nothing.” It’s an unfortunate metaphor for a film that ultimately, fails the eight episodes before it.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2019"," Millions upon millions of dollars have been poured into a series of Flash Gordon-esque movies about the unseen “Force” around us for the better part of a half-century. Many millions more have been poured into the bank accounts of Disney execs by casual and ardent fans of the acclaimed “Star Wars” franchise that reached its summation this weekend with director JJ Abrams’ second turn at the helm of the series, “The Rise of Skywalker.” Equally fulfilling and frustrating, the ninth entry of the Skywalker Saga gives audiences a dynamic and exciting experience to keep family members occupied this holiday season. Set well after the events of the eighth episode “The Last Jedi,” “Skywalker” follows Resistance fighters Rey, Poe Dameron and Finn as they seek to destroy the reborn Emperor Palpatine and escape the clutches of Kylo Ren’s First Order. As “Star Wars” films go, “Skywalker” is better than the forgettable prequel trilogy from the early 2000s, but lesser than the first two films of this new trilogy and all of the classic original set of films from the 70s and 80s. Young fans to the series won’t know the difference in this tale, which provides a satisfying conclusion to a lengthy tale of good vs. evil, the Force against the Dark Side. It just won’t hold up against the upper echelon of films in the “Star Wars” canon and could be forgotten once the inevitable spinoffs hit theaters. For the third straight episode, future Oscar nominee Adam Driver continues to be the best thing about this “Star Wars” trilogy with a layered, considered turn in a franchise that puts character development on the back burner for pomp and circumstance. His conflicted villain, Kylo Ren, is a perfect blend of petulant and saddened and Driver takes a role ripe for caricature and breathes depth and life into a one-note emo baddie. He’s matched well opposite Daisy Ridley’s most versatile turn in the role of Rey, the last hope of the Resistance seeking her identity while fighting for the lives of her friends. Ridley shows conflict within her own character and the inner turmoil she experiences resonates with audiences and feels as authentic as it can in a nine-film space odyssey. Talented actors like Oscar Isaac, Keri Russell and John Boyega are given plenty of screen time, but take a relative back seat to the Rey-Kylo Ren saga and sacrifice for nostalgia’s sake. Carrie Fisher, who passed away prior to filming, is in far more of “Skywalker” than expected as Abrams utilizes unused footage from prior films in this trilogy to shape the beginning of the film. While admirable, it’s still evident that Fisher’s performance is CGI-ed on top of new footage and there’s a disconnect between characters in scenes opposite her Princess Leia that’s hard to overlook. One of the best things about Rian Johnson’s superior entry into the Star Wars canon, 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” was the director’s clear vision to make a film on his own terms regardless of fan expectations. “Last Jedi” is largely successful with its bold, audacious subversion of expectations. Abrams blatantly walks back Johnson’s film — sidelining characters and tossing aside plot points — in an effort to counteract perceived disappointment to end the trilogy, but this actually has the opposite effect, sacrificing quality for mass appeal. The film has some truly remarkable action sequences, though “Skywalker” is far more visually dynamic and inventive fighting on the ground than blowing things up in the air. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel put Ridley and Driver through the paces in a whirlwind of lightsaber flares and giving “Skywalker” must-see moments that will stick with audiences far longer than Rey’s ret-conned origin story. A potential awards nominee, “Skywalker” probably isn’t on the level it needs to be to receive a Best Picture nomination. John Williams, however, is a strong contender for a Best Original Score nod. There’s a little something for everyone in “The Rise of Skywalker” that should drive audiences to theaters in droves and though it’s worth the experience on a big screen, something feels incomplete that keeps Abrams’ film from matching the dazzling heights a “Star Wars” movie is capable of.",POSITIVE

critic's rating: 



3.0/5

Visually stunningThe ninth film in the Star War series is both an end and a beginning. It answers some persistent questions asked by frustrated fans ever since the first film in the new trilogy -- Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) came about. It lays bare some mysteries and gives birth to some more. It might feel like the best Star Wars film of the modern era to some and for others, present reviewer included, it might prove to be an underwhelming experience overall.The death of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in The Last Jedi (2017) and the real-life passing away of Carrie Fisher, who played the iconic Princess Leia added an emotional gravitas to it. Given that context, and compared to The Force Awakens, where Han Solo's (Harrison Ford) death really punched the viewers in the guts, the present film feels lightweight in contrast. It lacks the dramatic elegance and emotional core of the first two films of the current trilogy.There are reports that Emperor Palpatine, long thought to be dead, is actually alive and maybe upto his old tricks. Both Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) want to investigate the truth behind these rumours for their own reasons. Meanwhile, the Resistance wants to find out what the opposition is planning next and they send Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), as also and Chewie (Jonas Suotamo) abroad the Millenium Falcon to find that out. They have their own set of adventures before uniting with Rey. Our three protagonists then are set upon a quest to find a mystical object which will lead them towards Palpatine’s whereabouts. Their journey takes them to the frigid mountainous planet Kijimi, where Poe finds former associate Zorii Bliss, a fellow, ‘spice runner’ and also to the desert planet of Pasaana and to the ocean moon Kef Bir. The level of detail which has gone into the making of such diverse worlds is mindboggling indeed. The Kef Bir portions, seen in IMAX, actually make you feel you’ve been set amidst a gigantic ocean with mile-high waves threatening to crash down on you. They meet rebel leader Jannah (Naomi Ackie), on Kef Bir, though the character isn’t developed as much as it should have been later on. That’s very much the problem with the film per se. For instance, Keri Russell, who plays Zorii Bliss, doesn’t even get to show her face as it’s always behind a helmet. Old faces from the past films as also characters who died keep popping up without actually adding something significant to the plot development. One suspects they were added to keep the film’s nostalgia value going. The film offers a visual splendour unlike anything we have seen in recent times and one can watch it on repeat just for the extraordinary worlds on display. The action sequences involving the lightsabers, the various chases out in space and the final battle scene too take your breath away. But strangely the dramatic talents of its humungous cast lies vastly underutilised. What the film lacks is a big push, a big finale offering emotional catharsis to the viewers but that doesn’t happen. Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver aren’t given much of a scope to exercise their acting chops. The haphazard screenplay has led to some sloppy editing as well. Kylo Ren just conveniently lands up wherever he’s required out of the blue. A well-loved character is thought to be dead and then mysteriously found to be living. Director JJ Abrams seems to have been in a hurry to wrap up things. Given the finesse of the first two films, this one feels like a hastily put together product in comparison...

"Dec 24, 2019"," There is a reason why the Star Wars franchise is called a space opera: everything happens in a galaxy far far away, and almost everything—the rattle of sabres, the stomping of the storm-troopers, the squeak of the droids, the innumerable skirmishes and chases on land and air—is accompanied by swelling operatic riffs. Episode IX is the third of the trilogy (The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi), and the final episode of the legend of Skywalker. Only those who are die-hard fans will remember the order and the sequence of the films, and have an instant reckoner of the characters that flit in and out of this mammoth saga, which began more than forty years back. For someone like me, who has seen every single film, and will continue to do so because, well, nostalgia, and, well, how can you not, it’s more about curiosity – how does this end? Does it end at all? The film opens on a brisk note. Rey (Ridley) is hard at work, being trained under the kindly but firm eye of Princess Leia (Fisher). Soon enough she and her mates, crack pilot Poe (Isaac) and ex-stormtrooper Finn (Boyega) are out and about, taxed with saving the universe from the evil intentions of the Dark Lord of Sith (Mcdiarmid) and his icy lieutenant (Grant). But before Rey gets to her target, she has to contend with Kylo Ren (Driver), who seems to stand between her and her destiny. Or is he? This is just the bare bones of a film stuffed with overused Star Wars tropes-and-plotlines you can think of, but what Abrams does is to keep things moving very swiftly. How different can one space chase be from another? Why, by making at least one absolutely spectacular: the screen explodes in an orange ball of fire, and you exhale, just at that very minute. But the reason why this one works (as opposed to the many editions which were overpowered by clanking machines) is because of the emotional connects it creates with us. You feel for our old pal C-3PO (Daniels is the only actor to have appeared in every film of the series) as it yanks hard at its memory banks. You are anxious when the furry Chewbacca (Suotamo) is taken prisoner. But most of all you feel for the two people who are at the heart of this film, Rey and Ren, as they clash, come close, pull apart, exploring the strange bond between them. There’s one scene between the two, when there is silence, broken only by their words, that is the most powerful of the film. And even if I did guess what’s coming (this is what comes of too much familiarity), I still exited the theater smiling. And psst, maybe it was the end, and maybe not. A little giveaway strand in the climax hints at fresh adventures, so I’m guessing there will be more: after all, there are so many galaxies even farther away. The FIDE Chess Candidates 2024 Round 14 is the final round of the intense three-week-long tournament. 17-year-old D Gukesh is leading by half a point, with three veterans close behind. Gukesh holds his fate in his hands as he faces Hikaru Nakamura, while Ian Nepomniachtchi and Fabiano Caruana play against each other. For live coverage and updates follow our liveblog.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," One of the many subplots of Star Wars: Rise of the Skywalker is about a mole on one of the two warring sides. The mole’s identity, while not central to the plot, still piques the viewers’ interest. Who could it be? While one might land on the right guess in an attempt or two, it’s the mole’s intention that demands your attention. They say they did it out of spite for another, the one calling all the shots. “I don’t care if you win, I just want *redacted* to lose,” they say.  In that moment, having sat through more than an hour of JJ Abrams’ ordeal of a film, I wondered if JJ was speaking through this character. With Rise of the Skywalker, JJ sets on fire the biggest ideas, characters, and their arcs that were introduced by Rian Johnson in the divisive predecessor The Last Jedi. Could it be out of spite? This rising large, dark cloud of a film is a clue if I’ve ever seen one. In 2017, Rian’s The Last Jedi divided Star Wars fans into two groups -- those who liked it and those who hated it with the fiery vengeance. How could Rey (Daisey Ridley) be a nobody? How could Supreme Leader Snoke get taken out without any answers about his origin? How is there not enough nostalgia? A clarification—Personally, I loved The Last Jedi and its many new ideas including Rey’s ancestry and legacy being swept off the plot line. Why do our heroes always have to be special by birth; born to important people who inadvertently die? Here’s looking at you Rowling. And the harsh criticism seems to be the force that flowed through JJ, his only guide as he birthed this confused mess of a film. He set out to ‘right’ all the ‘wrongs’ one-by-one, losing the bigger picture, the film, the trilogy or hell, even the 9-film franchise.  There is fun to be had in individual scenes, how else would they have been able to cut two brilliant trailers out of a movie as dull as this one. The action is still gorgeous and grand but nothing, absolutely nothing, will get your heart racing as much as seeing Laura Dern tear through a Star Destroyer at light speed. Nothing will look as stunning as ships leaving a trail of blood red salt on the battlefield. And no send-off will be as perfect as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) evaporating in thin air. Instead of building off the last film and tying away those ideas, we are dragged though yet another infestation of Jedi ghosts, Sith rituals, more chatter about Rey choosing the right side, something one would think was behind us after that month long trainee program under Luke. And yet, like a desperate suitor who just wouldn’t take no for an answer, Kylo won’t stop trying to seduce her to the dark side. It’s a whole exercise and just not fun or even sexy anymore. Adam Driver is not even meme-ably shirtless anymore.  Rey, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) band together as the Harry, Ron and Hermione of a galaxy far far away. Hopping from one set location to another (most likely one giant green wall), they are always searching for one MacGuffin or another. The motivations are immediate and the missions eat up the scenery. There is no room for emotions, which is a shame considering one is supposed to bid goodbye to these characters, some of which we have loved for decades.  Rise of the Skywalker is a disappointment bigger than The Last Jedi could ever have been. Taking risks and not landing on your feet is still forgivable. You stuck to your guns Rian Johnson and someday the world will appreciate you for it. And someday, no one will remember who made the best ghost of their favourite film.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2019"," Synopsis: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is revealed to be behind the First Order’s sinister rise to power. Rey (Daisy Ridley) et al race against time to locate the Emperor’s whereabouts so as to prevent his complete rule over the galaxy. Review: So this is what the cultural logic of end-point franchise cinema looks like. Something witless, soulless, and a colossally boring experience to boot. 142 minutes of deluxe brand management par excellence, but as a piece of vital, cohesive cinema, it’s DOA. The Rise of Skywalker casts even Star Wars’ prequel trilogy in a more favourable light. Yes, those three films were increasingly infantile and visually callow, but at least they were never as cynical nor as dull as this film is. Disney’s calculating co-option of identity politics (something I never fell for in The Last Jedi unlike many a millennial commentator) is revealed as the sham it is here. All the non-heteronormative, non-caucasian dimensions are dispensed with, as is the laughably crude slavery subplot of that film. That supposes there are some characters of three-dimensional merit here, but everyone – even nominal hero Rey – is flattened into a homogeneous smudge. The interior logic of the Star Wars world is also completely shot to pieces here. The Force seems an increasingly malleable entity designed to twist the boundaries of narrative logic at the filmmakers’ need and convenience. It can help Rey hold up a spaceship and reverse a fatal injury, yet she still has to use a makeshift raft to battle wild seas on her way to the fallen Death Star and it doesn’t stop some characters from dying. And it’s genuinely no longer clear who is dead, how they died, what constitutes a mortal wound, who is granted hologram status etc.? You did a splendid job on your review.  I consider this movie a major let down having invested a lifetime of opening day premiers from the first Star Wars.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," To call the dialogue around Star Wars deafening would be an understatement. No franchise on Earth inspires as much frustration or anger at the drop of a hat. The audience for the sci-fi epic has seemingly been at odds with itself since Empire Strikes Back, but the ferocity at which we consume the content has never dwindled. The most recent trilogy has been no different, with loud and valid criticisms echoing throughout the series. Disney and LucasFilm seem ready to move on from the divisiveness, by ending the storied “Skywalker Saga” with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. With J.J. Abrams back in the director’s chair, it quickly becomes apparent that your interpretation of the meaning of Star Wars colors your opinion of the finale. Whether intentional or not, the rushed product shows on the screen, featuring heavy fan service over new storytelling. Depending on where you land as a consumer, you’ll find value or anger. In this critic’s opinion, we’ve reached a new low for the series, cementing a sad truth about the franchise. With The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams confirmed that originality in this franchise can only come outside of the Skywalker tales. The sprint to the finish leaves the audience with a movie that has more in common with Transformers than Return of the Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker begins with our characters spread out throughout the galaxy. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) hunts for the shadow of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training under the tutelage of Leia (Carrie Fisher). Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) search for secret information from a Rebel Spy. With it clear that Palpatine has returned with an army unlike any other, the next generation begins a quest to stop Palpatine and the enormous power he wields. The issues within the film begin almost immediately. After the opening crawl confirms that Palpatine has resurfaced, it enters into a non-stop montage of planet jumping. The breakneck pace provides some interesting moments but never lets us feel a sense of place. Within the first thirty minutes, we visit more than a half-dozen unique locations, but the film does not even bother to let you know the names of many of them. Abrams chooses to cram in an entire trilogies worth of story into a two and half hour film, burning through the plot without allowing us to feel anything. Even the announcement that the equivalent of Space Hitler has returned elicits nearly no reaction from the characters listening. Setting up the story in such a way removes any stakes of consequence. It’s clear that no real character development will occur, and this issue plagues the rest of the film. Unfortunately, Rise of Skywalker features the worst script of the Disney films, making Solo look like Faulkner. The platitudes of “there are more of us then there are of them” and “don’t be afraid of who you are” come across as meaningless diatribes. What makes their recurrence so frustrating is that they are flat out not supported by the film in question. The “Final Order” (an extremely boring name that is the Star Wars equivalent of Unobtainium) literally has more ships with more firepower, and the question of identity drags the film down at every turn. Worst of all, we spend time on plot lines that could be condensed with another round of rewrites, making you question if there was a memo to make a release date rather than tell a powerful story. Even worse, Abrams embarks on the journey without a thesis statement for why this story should exist at all. Much of The Rise of Skywalker feels like fan-fiction, promising the audience to “check out this cool thing I thought of” instead of imbuing the story with meaning. Whether or not you enjoyed The Last Jedi or The Force Awakens, each film challenges its audience. The Last Jedi asks the audience to imagine a world beyond the Skywalker saga, democratizing the story and the Force in a way that hasn’t been true since A New Hope. On the flip side, the Force Awakens wonders what success looks like when you’re standing in the shadows of giants. It questions how we make our own way, both to our benefit and detriment. Instead, The Rise of Skywalker is more focused on plodding along to hit plot checkpoints than give our characters the endings they deserved. For all its faults, Ridley and Driver build on their excellent chemistry. Each of the actors has put so much heart into the roles that their relationship remains the lone bright spot of the film. Ridley does her best to make her character have internal moments, but the neverending string of MacGuffins leaves her with no time to reflect on her future. Driver gets more personal moments, but you can’t help but feel the loss of Fisher in his role. Perhaps the most baffling choice in the film occurs early on when Abrams resurrects the helmet. Beyond the obvious dig at Johnson’s choice to destroy it, Abrams puts one of the most emotional and expressive performers on the planet behind a mask again. Why he did this at all continues to baffle me. Any character that received real development in The Last Jedi gets walked back. We have to watch Poe become a leader (again), Finn becomes a force-sensitive (I guess?), and Rose gets Jar Jar’d. Original cast members are tossed at the screen on infinite loop in order to placate fans who want to see the expanded adventures of Luke, Leia, Han and Lando. This takes the power out of this generation’s hands, leaving them to become side characters within the saga. Instead, the Palpatine reveals becomes a Blofeld level explainer, as he was the puppeteer pulling all the strings of all the characters for nine films. Rather than build upon the film that came before, Abrams does everything he can to ignore it, despite the fact that he was unwilling to commit to the franchise just five years ago. For some fans, this will work. After all, what Star Wars means to you entirely depends on the viewer. However, as a piece of storytelling, this film is broken. It has bad dialogue, does not give its characters time to breathe in any real way, and focuses too much on fan service to tell its own tale. Everything in this movie has already come to pass in the Star Wars universe with better storytelling. If it cannot expand itself beyond those moments, its not a movie. Its a piece of fan fiction. I’ve always wanted this franchise to move beyond its original trilogy. With The Rise of Skywalker, it’s proven that the ghosts are too powerful from ever letting it do so.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 24, 2019"," Hardcore fans have some big opinions on how Disney has handled the third trilogy, known as the Sequel Trilogy. Here is mine, for clarity’s sake: it’s pretty good. The Force Awakens was a zippy and agreeable stealth reboot/sequel. It’s a good time, though not a great movie; it lacks that unique mythic resonance that makes Star Wars, well, Star Wars and the plot coincidences pile up with startling regularity but it delights. The Last Jedi is ambitious and introspective, serving as an honourable coda to the odyssey of Luke Skywalker while adding an interestingly troubled romantic wrinkle between lost soul Jedi-in-training Rey and malevolent-yet-conflicted-about-it Kylo Ren.  So, how fares the final one – the so-called culmination of the Skywalker Saga - The Rise of Skywalker? Well, It’s a Disney World Theme Park Ride. Occasionally, and with obvious strain, it can muster enough gravitas to match a Saturday morning cartoon. It was manufactured to placate a riled up fan base, still sore from the controversial decisions of the last movie, and that’s exactly where its ambition ended.  The most problematic element here is the return of the Emperor. It is the albatross dangling from this movie’s neck. He most definitively died in Return of the Jedi – he was tossed into an abyss and exploded. So, yeah, he’s back, and he has inexplicably ‘magic-ed’ a fleet of a thousand Star Destroyers. Kylo Ren, threatened by his power, attempts to kill him. But the Emperor offers all his resources to Kylo. All he has to do is bring Rey to him so he can turn her to the dark side. I have so many questions that will never be answered because director JJ Abrams and Chris Terrio don’t have the answers, plain and simple. By the way, if you’re still attempting to seduce Star Wars protagonists 40 something years later, you’re a slow learner.  Rey’s journey took on an interesting form in The Last Jedi. You can bet that Rise of Skywalker undoes all that, ultimately making her a bland carbon copy of Luke. Finn and Poe are…uh, present? Because John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are so talented, they can exude charming camaraderie and make things seem more fun than they are. These three leads are not a patch on Han, Luke and Leia, though, not by a damn sight. Speaking of Leia, the late Carrie Fisher is reanimated, thanks to some chillingly convincing digital necromancy. I suppose it’s a nice thing, but it’s hard to shake the feeling her scene partners have to act around her, rather than naturally react to her. She has no memorable lines because she is composed entirely of deleted scenes from another movie. I don’t know what everyone else’s excuse is. The most damming thing I can say about The Rise of Skywalker is I walked out feeling apathetic about the whole thing. The good things about it, and there are good things for sure, dissolve like cotton candy; you might say it doesn't leave you much to chew on. This reheated dinner is how they decide to end the Skywalker saga? They could've done better - and they did, in 1983.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019"," Stranded amid vast dunes of clever callbacks and miniaturization of stakes and lessening of fates, Abrams has made his “Godfather III”: he’s shrunk what could have been a tapestry into an LED billboard. The lore’s a bore and the exposition’s a chore: all that shiny metal, all those piles of scrap, the stars above, and beneath, the fiery eyes of Daisy Ridley, the sole beacon, with promise of a story with emotional investment and volcanic result. J. J. Abrams betrays Daisy Ridley’s eyes. After the unsatisfying conclusion, the sound from the crowd was mostly shuffling feet.

"Dec 23, 2019"," Como si la tarea no fuera lo suficientemente desafiante como para escribir el final de una trilogía de la que posiblemente sea la serie de películas más popular de todos los tiempos, el ganador del Oscar Chris Terrio (Argo) y J.J. Abrams, que también actúa como director en Episodio VII: The Force Awakens, han decidido comercializar agresivamente a Star Wars Episodio IX: The Rise of  Skywalker como el final de la saga Skywalker, la cual abarca más de 40 años y nueve películas. La expectativa difícilmente podría ser mayor, incluso si después del Episode VIII: The last Jedi, la cual rompió con muchas convenciones de la Star Wars y fue comparativamente controvertida, estaba claro que sería imposible reunir todos los deseos de los fans bajo un mismo techo. Abrams y Terrio (o sus superiores en Disney) obviamente no ignoraron las fuertes críticas a The last Jedi de Rian Johnson por parte de una parte de los fans, por lo que The Rise of Skywalker estaría más orientada hacia la trilogía original, así como hacia The Force Awakens de Abrams - ignorando parcialmente los acontecimientos de la película anterior.  Al final, Abrams y Terrio, probablemente siguiendo las instrucciones de los jefes de los estudios alrededor de Kathleen Kennedy, trataron de encontrar el gran final de la saga Skywalker como un compromiso entre las demandas de los viejos fans tradicionalistas-fundamentalistas y las de los fans más abiertos de Star Wars. Después de que The last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker toma un poco más de tiempo en su narrativa, ya que Rey y sus amigos tienen que averiguar primero el paradero de Palpatine (lo que irónicamente recuerda un poco a la búsqueda de Luke en ""El despertar de la Fuerza""). Esto tiene la ventaja de que podemos ver más mundos, además de que Abrams se dedica más a lo que en realidad se echaba un poco de menos en The last Jedi: los personajes principales y su interacción entre sí.  Después de que Rey se separara de sus amigos Finn y Poe durante la mayor parte de ""El último Jedi"", ahora pasan mucho más tiempo juntos y la chispeante química entre el trío (además de Chewbacca y BB-8) hace que estas secuencias sean increíblemente divertidas. Es discutible que este trío se acerca al icónico de Luke, Leia y Han, y si no te consideras como fan nostálgico, no puedes negar que definitivamente cuenta entre los puntos culminantes de la nueva trilogía.  El corazón de esta trilogía, sin embargo, es la relación extremadamente complicada entre Rey y Kylo Ren. Se supone que Kylo debe encontrar a Rey por órdenes de Palpatine, pero no le oculta que sigue estando muy interesado en la invencible alianza entre ellos, la cual Rey había rechazado en The last Jedi después de la muerte de Snooke. Kylo, que por cierto está a menudo en el camino con sus ""Caballeros Ren"", que curiosamente no parecen tener una muy buena reputación entre las tropas de asalto normales y son notorios como ""ghouls”, siguen acosando a Rey telepáticamente y han descubierto un secreto de Palpatine con el que puede convencer a Rey.  El duelo psicológico entre el Jedi (aún no totalmente entrenado) y el Jedi caído se escenifica de forma genial como en The last Jedi y se presenta con toda una serie de luchas de sables de luz a ritmo rápido y maravillosamente coreografiadas, además Daisy Ridley y especialmente Adam Driver ofrecen los mejores logros de actuación de la película. En este aspecto, la nueva trilogía tiene claramente la nariz delante de la trilogía, porque la relación entre Luke Skywalker y Darth Vader simplemente no tuvo el tiempo suficiente para profundizar en lo similar a Rey y Kylo, la trilogía de la precuela hizo un mejor trabajo con Anakin y Palpatine, pero también raramente alcanzó la intensidad de los momentos de Rey-Kylo. Mientras tanto, una cosa está clara: nadie debería esperar una obra maestra de The Rise of Skywalker. La trama se basa principalmente en un MacGuffin clásico (para encontrar a Palpatine se necesita un guía Sith) y aunque hay muchas sorpresas y giros en los detalles, con muchas alusiones a las películas anteriores, la línea de la historia es muy predecible, aunque por supuesto este fue el caso de la mayoría de las películas de Star Wars.  Al final, las películas de Star Wars son cuentos de hadas y hay cosas más importantes que la lógica y la mayor cercanía posible a la realidad. Además, The Rise of Skywalker de Abrams es tan agitada y rápida que apenas tienes tiempo para pensar mientras la ves. Lo que se nota sin embargo son algunas correcciones de las valientes decisiones, que Rian Johnson hizo en The last Jedi. Sí, la descendencia de Rey todavía juega un papel, además de que la relación entre algunos personajes parece haber cambiado (por ejemplo, Finn y Rose). Estas correcciones, aunque en su mayoría no son dramáticas, pueden ser absolutamente lamentables, y creo que los cameos, que podrían haberse esperado en vista del épico final después de 42 años, podrían haber sido utilizados mucho mejor, incluso Palpatine en realidad tiene muy poco que hacer para justificar realmente su espectacular regreso en cuanto a la historia. Es similar con el segundo retorno de Lando Calrissian; su importancia es manejable, pero como sólo fue un gran papel secundario en lugar de un verdadero protagonista en la trilogía original, está bien y definitivamente te alegras de ver a Billy Dee Williams como el todavía carismático Lando. The Rise of Skywalker es un cúmulo de coincidencias y acontecimientos felices para los protagonistas, a quienes no les importan las circunstancias retratadas hasta ahora, y al mismo tiempo tienen problemas para no contradecir al predecesor directo en un ciclo continuo. En este caso, sin embargo, la culpa es sólo en parte del director J.J. Abrams. The Rise of Skywalker entretiene y, por supuesto, impresiona principalmente a nivel visual, es al mismo tiempo un producto de narración rápida y una actitud dudosa sobre la dirección tomada. Algunos lo llaman servicio a los fans, otros nostalgia y algunos hablan de pura falta de imaginación. En cuanto a la trama, The Rise of Skywalker no vale la pena mencionarla. Una acumulación de coincidencias y giros afortunados, que no se explican suficientemente y no tienen mucho sentido con respecto a las predecesoras, conducen a un final extremadamente insatisfactorio. Sin embargo, la película puede entretener desde el primer hasta el último minuto, siempre y cuando hayas cambiado tu cerebro al modo de cine sin exigencias.

"Dec 23, 2019"," As General Leia Organa, the late Carrie Fisher gets most of the best lines in The Rise of Skywalker. “Never underestimate a droid.” “Never be afraid of who you are.” And the ever-hopeful directive: “Tell me when you get back.” Between that and the occasional force-ghost, they might have been better off calling it Episode IX: The Dead Speak! So where are we in this, the final chapter of the saga? Well, Kylo (Adam Driver) and the Knights who say Ren are scouring the galaxy for more potent evil power. Good news on that front; no giant killer space station in this one. The First Order has finally learned its lesson, and I half expected the soundtrack to include that ol’ Endor-ian folk song The Wreck of The Emperor’s Death Star. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn (Oscar Isaac, John Boyega) are trying to make contact with a mole within the First Order, while Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training. There’s a lot of fast cutting from one narrative thread to another – I believe the technical term is lightspeed skipping – but what else can you do? It’s a big galaxy. The Rise of Skywalker marks the return of J.J. Abrams as director, after Rian Johnson took the reins for Episode VIII. This gives the film an emotional as well as a narrative consistency with 2015’s The Force Awakens. In fact, one could almost skip the middle movie, though at the risk of missing out on the badass Holdo maneuver, which is still spoken of in hushed tones in this chapter. Gripe all you like about George Lucas and his Gungans and Midichlorians (neither of which returns here) but there’s something to be said for a singular authorial voice running through a trilogy. And speaking of continuity, John Williams’ score does little that’s new, but makes great use of the series’ themes at all the right moments. I particularly enjoyed his callback to “Music to Lift an X-Wing Fighter Out of a Swamp to,” from The Empire Strikes Back. The plot this time resembles an intra-galactic treasure hunt. The Resistance is looking for a fabled world called Exogol, and they need a Sith Wayfinder – basically an evil GPS – to locate it. This leads them first to a desert planet where you can find almost anything; I think it’s called Kijiji. Exogol, by the way, is a whole new biome – in a galaxy full of sand planets and ice planets and water planets, this one’s all lightning all the time. Perfect for evil lairs and nefarious plotting. The film introduces a few new characters. There’s D-O, the requisite cute droid, who looks like a hair dryer riding a unicycle. Keri Russell (recognizable by her voice) plays Zorii Bliss, a masked character from Poe’s shady past. And Richard E. Grant is marvellous as the First Order’s Allegiant General Pryde. Allegiant General? Somebody promote this guy to Grand Moff! Oh, and there’s a tiny droid mechanic by the name of Babu Frik, who does some work on C-3PO that I’m certain voids his warranty. Babu is also the nearest thing to a Baby Yoda (or indeed any Yoda) in this movie. But for the most part we follow Rey and Poe and Finn and Chewbacca in their quest to right wrongs and stop the machinations of the First Order, which is now calling itself – rather pessimistically if you ask me – the Final Order. And while I won’t be revealing any questions of parentage, rest assured the film will do so by the end. Was it worth the wait? On the one hand, probably not. After all, what mere movie can satisfy the urgings of a hundred million fans over the 42 years since the first film premiered? But this Star Wars devotee teared up twice during the action, and almost a third time in the final scene. And if you’d asked the fans in 1977 how we wanted it to end, you’d have been met with blank stares. We never wanted it to end. And in a very real way, it never will.

"Dec 23, 2019"," J.J. Abrams’ “final chapter” in the new “Star Wars” trilogy backtracks the boldest ideas of the previous entry, “The Last Jedi”—and in the process, succumbs to bad-faith “fans.” Midway through Rise of Skywalker, a bolt of lightning cracks the sky in two. It’s a moment of illumination—or at least, it’s supposed to be—revealing a new, unexpected answer to a mystery the Star Wars saga had previously put to rest. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi resolved the intrigue surrounding the heroine of this new sequel-trilogy, Rey, and her parentage with a gracefully simple, bold assertion: Rey is…just Rey. A scavenger from Jakku, descended from ordinary junk traders who left her behind on the planet, sold her off, and never looked back. Not the daughter of some space aristocracy or legacy lineage, but a hero of her own making. And that was enough, until that lightning strike. Pushed to the limits of her abilities and desperate to save a friend, Rey shoots bolts of electricity from her fingertips—just the way Emperor Palpatine could before Darth Vader killed him at the end of Return of the Jedi. We soon learn that Rey from Nowhere is in fact Rey Palpatine, granddaughter of the sinister puppetmaster behind the Sith’s plots to take control of the Force in the original and prequel Star Wars trilogies. It’s a baffling twist, not least because the movie never touches on just when, exactly, or with whom Palpatine procreated. (Try purging that image from your head once it’s in.) To those invested in The Last Jedi’s ideas about the Force and heroism, it’s also a crassly cynical letdown. Johnson’s installment dedicated itself to democratizing the Force, breathing new life into a mystical idea that had, until now, always appointed a Skywalker—Anakin, Luke, Leia, Ben—as the central heroes and/or antiheroes in the story of saving the galaxy. That Rey’s parents were ordinary people meant anyone from anywhere could be born a hero; what determined a person’s place in the world was who they chose to be, rather than their last name.  The Last Jedi’s parting shot underscored the beauty of that notion: a stable boy on Canto Bight—who, like Rey, was pawned off by his parents—uses the Force to summon a broom to his hand. The yearning notes of Luke’s theme play as he looks up in time to see the Millennium Falcon jump into hyperdrive. Inspired, he lifts the handle of his broom just so, evoking the silhouette of a Jedi and his lightsaber. The Force is for anyone, the scene seemed to say—and so is Star Wars. It was a bold, meaningful idea for the franchise, and necessary to opening up its future. Having Rey confront the loneliest answer to a lifelong burning question felt like the dramatic equivalent of Luke learning that his father was actually Darth Vader, Johnson has explained. The Empire Strikes Back injected notes of gray into a previously black-and-white situation, denying the Jedi-in-training (and the audience) the easiest recourse: to hate the villain and want to see him die.  The Last Jedi pulls something similar with Rey’s story, denying her the luxury of a predetermined destiny. “Rey is our protagonist. And the truth is, in the story, the toughest possible thing for her to hear is, you know, you’re not gonna get the easy answer that you’re so-and-so’s daughter, this is your place,” Johnson told me after The Last Jedi’s release. “You’re gonna have to stand on your own two feet and define yourself in this world. And you always want to throw the hardest thing at your protagonist.” The resonance between Luke’s and Rey’s stories boiled down something essential about Star Wars’s appeal, rather than just replicating a plot point, the way Rise of Skywalker does. In separate ways, The Last Jedi jettisoned many of the new trilogy’s remaining, overly-literal parallels from past films—not in an effort to discard the legacy of Star Wars, but to build on it. To free it. “Let the past die. Kill it, if you have to. That’s the only way to become what you are meant to be,” Kylo Ren tells Rey in one of the film’s many bits of meta-text, after he strikes down the First Order’s Supreme Leader Snoke. We knew little about the shadowy figure who seduced Kylo to the Dark Side, except that he seemed to fill the role of a Palpatine-type with sparklier taste in robes. His unceremonious death cleared the board for a renewed focus on the trilogy’s more compelling antagonist: Kylo Ren himself.  But instead of taking the baton from Last Jedi and running with it to new heights, The Rise of Skywalker retreats right back into the safety of nostalgia. (The movie sends its heroes to the carcass of the Death Star; it does not aim for subtlety.) Director J.J. Abrams and co-screenwriter Chris Terrio resurrect the actual Palpatine—the same guy we watched explode at the end of Return of the Jedi—and for the most part hand-wave away the many questions that brings up. How is he alive? Who cares. He is a space zombie now. He wheels himself around his Snoke-cloning lab, delivering garbled monologues while a coliseum packed with his fellow space zombies go absolutely ham for it all in the background. No one so much as blinks at the space zombie cult. No one has time to absorb much of anything. We learn Palpatine fathered a son at some point. That son, whose name is never mentioned, and his wife, played by a tragically underutilized Jodie Comer of Killing Eve, are Rey’s parents. The Emperor ordered his granddaughter’s death when he sensed how powerful she would become, so her parents went incognito, hid her away, and died refusing to give her up. Rey from Nowhere becomes Rey Palpatine, the youngest of an aristocratic bloodline whose most famous member sparked two unnecessary galactic wars. This is better somehow, because Sheev Palpatine is important and Rey is not. Even apart from the anti-climax of Rey’s lineage loophole, truly, nothing about this Palpatine story works. First he sends Kylo to kill Rey. But when that doesn’t work and she shows up at his evil lair instead, he explains that, actually, this was his plan all along. Then he lays out the same catch-22 he bamboozled Luke with 36 years ago: If Rey kills him, he wins. And this time, he says, his spirit will transfer into her and all the past Sith will live on through her.  He goads her and insults her and makes long, drawn-out callbacks to Return of the Jedi and gushes endlessly about his new fleet of Star Destroyers, each now essentially equipped with its own Death Star. There’s bigger lightning! More Death Stars! That’s what us Star Wars rubes want, right? Finally, Rey mercifully just shuts Palpatine up and kills him. And nothing happens. All of that spirit-transfer stuff was made up, I guess? So Palpatine explodes (again) and no one breathes a peep about whether his death this time is for real. Everyone cheers, Chewie gets his medal. We’re not supposed to think about it more deeply than that. (There’s a distasteful strain of condescension that runs through The Rise of Skywalker in more instances than this.) The most generous reading of the whole botched subject of Rey’s parentage might go something like this: she rises to greatness despite the stain on her family name; no matter what’s in your blood, that tells us, you can still choose to be a hero. Which, OK. Setting aside that this reading reduces the point of Rey’s story to a near photocopy of Luke’s (one better resolved in Return of the Jedi than in this mess), it also holds true only of the last half of one film. If Palpatine’s presence and Rey’s contention with the Dark Side had been signaled earlier, Rise of Skywalker’s conclusions about bloodlines and fate might feel less muddled. But that isn’t what this trilogy has been about, until now.  TROS is so hellbent on facilitating Palpatine’s rushed entrance and exit (he’s like Grandpa Simpson whistling his way into that restaurant), it’s as if Abrams and Terrio scrambled for a loophole specifically to mollify the “fans” upset that this hero—worse, this girl—dared to wield such incredible abilities with only her own strength. No, no, they’ve now assured those sectors of fandom. You see, her power comes from someone else, a (male) character you already know and accept. Rose delivered one of The Last Jedi’s most powerful lines after stopping Finn from sacrificing his life in a doomed attack on a First Order siege cannon: “That’s how we’re gonna win. Not by fighting what we hate. But saving what we love,” she said, before planting an innocent kiss on him. In The Rise of Skywalker, Rose delivers little more than technical jargon and remains offscreen for most of the film; she could just as well be an extra.  Abrams and Terrio also devote a stunningly fastidious energy to extinguishing the romance that had bloomed between Rose and Finn. The two barely speak in TROS. Rose stays behind while Rey, Poe, Finn, and the droids take off for a ludicrously convoluted fetch quest; she explains that she’s needed at Leia’s Resistance base, though she seemingly does very little there. Once all the main characters are in the same place again during the climactic third-act battle, Finn orders Rose to leave without him while he battles on with a new character, Jannah (a lovely, if underwritten ex-Stormtrooper), at his side. At the end of the film, as the Resistance celebrates its victory, Finn spares little more than a glance and a back-pat for Rose, then bounds off into a group hug with Poe and Rey. Her exclusion is so pointed, it seems all but purposely cruel.  Palpatine’s unnecessary return necessitated a regression for Kylo, too. At the end of The Last Jedi, Han Solo and Leia’s son was poised to be the Big Bad of Episode IX; instead he found himself back inside his mended Vader cosplay and subservient to Palpatine for much of Rise of Skywalker, the better to mimic Vader’s redemption arc.  Rey ends her journey alone in a desert much like the one where she began, far from her found family. A nosy woman pries about her last name and Rey adopts “Skywalker,” a touching gesture designed to appeal to Luke and Leia super-fans like me, but which I found distinctly unsatisfying. Why must Rey acquiesce to some stranger who demands to know her identity? Why can’t she be allowed to forge a new legacy of her own? The implied answer, I suppose, is that it’s more important that the Skywalker dynasty (and Disney’s IP) lives on past the screen life of the scavenger girl whose bravery and strength proved so divisive. I think of this ending and then the one that showed a little boy from nowhere dreaming of freedom and endless possibilities on Canto Bight. Between the two, I know which I prefer.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," After 42 years and eight films, creator George Lucas and co-writer and director JJ Abrams close out the Star Wars series with a 142-minute crowd-pleaser. It’s a challenge tying up a story that was first told in 1977 and has travelled forwards and backwards and then leapt ahead in time. Like the preceding episodes, this chapter too opens in a galaxy far, far away, but it quickens to a resolution. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is still on a quest to fill in the blanks about her childhood, parentage and purpose. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), lured more and more by the Dark Side and the ashen-faced emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), is on his way to planet Exogol, the lair for the Sith. Will Kylo, who is still overcoming granddaddy issues (Darth Vader, represented by his damaged mask), take over the reins of the Final Order? By now Ren and Rey’s yin and yang are hyper-synced and they frequently intercept each other in parallel planes, crossing their respective red and blue light sabers. Get a room, you feel like shouting to them.  Carrie Fisher is alive (enhanced with special effects) as Princess Leia. But will fans get to say a last goodbye to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford)? Eventually who will live, who will die and will this really be the end game for Star Wars? Set to pulsating music, including the now famous signature tune (because every character’s entry is to be rewarded), the film is fast-paced but not as glib as some of the previous ones. The dialogue and situations are often cheesy (brace yourself for a pep talk by Oscar Isaac’s Poe) and some resolutions are far too easy. Yet, Chapter IX is a must-watch for Star Wars fans because it gives closure. If Ridley does not have the charisma for a leading lady though she throws her all into Jedi business, Driver makes up for it in his own brooding way. His depictions of Kylo Ren and his real self Ben Solo – two characters in one – is best seen in the scene where an unarmed Kylo gets hold of a lightsaber. A slight grin and a subtle jig shows how the son of Hans Solo and Princes Leia has dealt with the Dark Side. But this is not Ren’s story as much as Rey’s, though one wishes it was. Abrams maintains a certain dated filming technique, reminiscent of the first trio of films, while adding modern-day computer graphics to breathlessly edited action sequences. While the script offers too many opportunities for homages,  fans will be pleased to see almost every epic character make at least a brief entrance. A number of the old favourites return, including the droids C3PO, R2D2 and BB-8, besides Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian. There are some additions, such Stormtroopers with enhanced skills and a few new cutesy creatures, including the mini droidsmith Babu Frik and additional concepts such as lightspeed skipping and wayfinders. At the end, even as Lucas and Abrams put a bow on it, you wish this wasn’t the final farewell to the space opera. Or maybe it isn’t.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," When you look at J.J. Abrams’s work as a director—his career on television between Felicity, Alias, and Lost is a different matter—the most noticeable through line is his eagerness to simply play around in another creator’s sandbox, to repackage nostalgia without ruffling too many feathers. His entries in the Mission: Impossible and Star Trek franchises aren’t considered high marks, but they’re fun, accessible pieces of entertainment; the filmmaking equivalent of getting straight Bs on a report card. (And yes, even though Super 8 is technically Abrams’s sole directorial outing with an original conceit, it owes as much to the iconography of Steven Spielberg as Stranger Things does to John Carpenter, Stephen King, and also Spielberg.) Abrams might not be your favorite filmmaker, but he was a sensible choice to usher in a new Star Wars trilogy under the Disney corporate umbrella.  The prevailing sentiment among The Force Awakens detractors was that his film was mostly a retread of A New Hope—none other than George Lucas reportedly lamented the movie’s lack of originality. But The Force Awakens doesn’t deserve such a broad takedown. The familiarity was a feature, not a bug—a sign that this trilogy wanted to evoke the spirit of the original films instead of Lucas’s prequels concerned with midi-chlorians and the Trade Federation. Plus, Abrams threw in some wrinkles. Our new characters included a Stormtrooper with a conscience and, in the angsty Kylo Ren, a villain whose ambition to live up to Darth Vader’s iconic presence mostly registered as pathetic rather than frightening. Indeed, The Force Awakens largely played it safe; there was a new Death Star—er, sorry, Starkiller Base, and everything. But Abrams laid the foundation for its sequels to navigate new and meaningful directions in a galaxy far, far away.  That’s what Rian Johnson ran with in The Last Jedi, the most groundbreaking entry in the saga since The Empire Strikes Back. There are enough Last Jedi takes on the internet to feed an entire continent, so let’s just cover the basics: With Rey’s parents being nobody of import, the film established that Force-abled heroes didn’t have to come from a historic lineage; it acknowledged, in a somewhat meta way, that the only way to embrace the future is to let the past die; it reckoned with the complicated legacy of the Jedi through Luke Skywalker’s own failures and insecurities; oh, and Supreme Leader Snoke was unimportant sashimi. The vocal minority of Star Wars fans who hated The Last Jedi seemed to think Johnson’s message was anti–Star Wars; really, he was interrogating the franchise’s legacy so that something he loved wouldn’t get stuck repeating familiar beats. And when fans complain that the new trilogy is either way too similar to the original films or antithetical to the Star Wars ethos, nobody wins.  Not even major Hollywood franchises can please everyone, yet that’s what Abrams and Co. aimed to do with The Rise of Skywalker. It didn’t work. By now, you’ll have seen the, uh, mixed reception to Rise of Skywalker; perhaps you already saw the film yourself. (The internet is so spoiler-averse these days that a detailed description of Chewbacca’s fur might warrant a few angry tweets, so if you really don’t want to know anything about Rise of Skywalker, please stop reading and take a peaceful walk outside.) What we have in Rise of Skywalker is a film equally committed to pandering and Last Jedi retconning—the latter of which makes the plot of the film nearly incomprehensible. The movie, unfortunately, lacks the imagination and spirit of the franchise’s greatest entries.  The compelling moral ambiguity The Last Jedi established is thrown away for another classic, pared-down confrontation between Jedi and Sith, led by a character who was tossed dramatically into an air shaft by Darth Vader in Return of the Jedi. It’s hard to believe this trilogy always envisioned Snoke as something Emperor Palpatine vaguely (and literally?) put together in a Sith lab (??), but Abrams is committed to the idea that Palpy is the Skywalker saga’s ultimate evil, even if the notion of this Sith lord still haunting the franchise strains credulity. But while Palpatine’s reemergence is mostly in service of the plot—the same can’t be said for the brief and unfortunately empty reprisal of Lando Calrissian—there are other areas where Rise of Skywalker feels like it’s trying to tell Last Jedi trolls that their protestations were heard.  Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose, a new character introduced in The Last Jedi as a Resistance fighter and potential love interest for Finn, is sidelined for most of the film—the most blatant shelving of a Star Wars character since Jar Jar Binks in Attack of the Clones. (Not that less Jar Jar screen time was a problem back then.) It’s not a great look, especially when you consider the actress was the target of harassment and racist comments on social media. Beyond that, any misgivings that Luke previously had about the Jedi, their philosophy, and their fatal hubris has apparently fallen away—it’s like becoming a Force ghost gave him a strange bout of amnesia.  Kylo Ren, and this is somehow not a joke, reassembles the old, smashed-up helmet he wore for most of The Force Awakens. And Rey’s parentage is once again brought to the fore after Abrams initially teased this mystery in The Force Awakens, and The Last Jedi appeared to close the book on it. (Though, in Abrams’s defense, this seems less like a rebuke to Johnson’s film and more something he always planned to do with the character.) With all the things Rise of Skywalker wants to undo from The Last Jedi, you’d assume the movie’s backlash made it a commercial flop on the level of Dark Phoenix—in fact, it’s actually the 13th-highest grossing movie of all time. Retconning The Last Jedi isn’t just a waste of time in the last leg of a trilogy, it creates a ridiculous precedent: One of the biggest entertainment companies on the planet will listen to anybody’s demands if they’re loud and brash enough.  Rise of Skywalker could have been a good Star Wars movie were it not so concerned with unnecessarily relitigating The Last Jedi and, sadly, if Carrie Fisher were still alive and the film didn’t have to repurpose unused Force Awakens footage of the actress. (It brings me no pleasure to report Leia’s scenes feel noticeably stilted on account of Abrams’s having to work around her old dialogue.) Instead of heeding The Last Jedi’s message of killing the past, Rise of Skywalker is actively trying to revive it—in a literal sense with Palpatine, and in bringing back the basic delineations of the Jedi-Sith conflict. Whether you liked The Last Jedi or not, Rise of Skywalker makes it clear that the Star Wars franchise is at war with itself on account of competing visions for how the Skywalker saga should be concluded.  Based on this franchise infighting, which made its way into the Rise of Skywalker press tour, it seems Disney didn’t insist on the same kind of oversight on Star Wars that helped turn the Marvel Cinematic Universe into a cultural behemoth. Led by Kevin Feige, the MCU worked out its early kinks—Ed Norton’s Hulk was canned; it was accepted, after two stand-alones, that Thor needed to actually be fun—and became a well-oiled, crowd-pleasing multibillion dollar machine in which all the films agree on the vibe of the fictional universe. Star Wars, meanwhile, seemed to have made things up as they went along, letting individual artists plan each installment—it’s important here to remember Colin Trevorrow was initially going to write and direct Episode IX, before everyone at Lucasfilm apparently saw The Book of Henry—without a full consideration of the bigger picture. In the end, all three films seemed to be at odds with one another, which leads to a bigger question: What was the actual point of this trilogy?  Obviously, the goal was to make money—and make no mistake, Rise of Skywalker is going to dominate its opening weekend box office even if it falls short on meteoric expectations. And for all its flaws, it’s a fun movie with some exemplary set pieces and sumptuous visuals: It’s Star Wars! But it becomes tempting to look back at this trilogy and think of the what-ifs. What if J.J. Abrams just had the keys to the whole trilogy and got to complete his safe, familiar, and yet cohesive vision? (This move wouldn’t have my vote, but at least it’d be consistent.) What if another filmmaker took over for Trevorrow and followed Johnson’s lead to take the franchise in a different direction? What if, before the trilogy was launched, everyone agreed to certain plot lines, like deciding who Rey’s parents were, before things got out of hand? What if Star Wars was still Star Wars, but—I can’t believe I’m saying this—actually had some Marvel-like synergy?  Lucas’s strange, undeniably flawed prequels might not reach the highs of his original trilogy, but it clearly wasn’t created with any committee-approved mandate to appease the widest possible audience. Any consolations made by Lucas were comparably minimal, like pretending Jar Jar never existed after near-universal disdain. In trying to win over everyone—including Last Jedi detractors—The Rise of Skywalker and its diminishing, redundant returns aren’t likely to please anyone hoping for a coherent ending to the Skywalker saga.

"Dec 23, 2019"," The Emperor Palpatine who appears in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has seen better days. He’s suspended at the end of a metal tentacle, kept alive long after he was supposed to have perished. He can’t walk under his own power, and he’s seemingly lost his vision. He’s trying to reclaim his former influence, but he’s a husk who lacks the vitality to rule the galaxy again. All he has are grounded ships, half-grown clones, and a recognizable but broken body that doesn’t work as well as it once did. He has no new ideas and no new blood. That makes him the barely living embodiment of a movie with little life of its own. The Rise of Skywalker looks and sounds snappier than its decrepit, quasi-resurrected villain, and it’s a better hang than the last lord of the Sith. But at its heart, if it has one, it’s just as soulless, uninspired, and tethered to the past. J.J. Abrams’s ending to the trilogy he began in 2015 offers a few laughs and a lot of familiar faces, but no new message and no added dimension to the Skywalker saga—no clever twist on the original trilogy, no surprise or subversion, no new layers of long-loved classics retroactively revealed. It isn’t the worst-written or the worst-acted Star Wars movie, but it is the most misconceived. And in failing to forge its own identity, it tarnishes the predecessors that it so slavishly imitates. Abrams is a serial recycler—bringing back Khan in Star Trek Into Darkness was a warm-up for the Palpatine reprise—and in his first film in the franchise, The Force Awakens, he carefully retraced George Lucas’s steps. To recap Episode VII (and thus, inadvertently recap Episode IV): A droid bearing information vital to a rebellion led by Princess Leia lands on a backwater planet, where it crosses paths with a Force-sensitive orphan. This hero from humble origins rides the Millennium Falcon off the planet but becomes embroiled in a struggle for survival against an evil Empire—not just any evil Empire, but essentially the same Empire as the one from the original trilogy, complete with an enormous superweapon that blows up planets. Her mentor and father figure is killed by Darth Vader’s grandson, who’s joined the family business of being a helmet-wearing dark sider who serves a Sith-like supreme ruler. As the superweapon readies to fire on the Rebel base and Leia and her allies count down to their destruction, the hero taps into her powers and rides forth to rescue them. Daring rebel pilots make a trench run and destroy the superweapon, but Vader’s descendant escapes. In many ways, The Force Awakens’ obvious parallels to A New Hope were forgivable: In Disney’s first Star Wars film and the inaugural entry in a new trilogy, Abrams was tasked with going back to basics, rebooting the Skywalker saga after a decade-long drought, and distancing the series from the stain of the prequels. It accomplished its mission to restore Star Wars to cultural prominence and make a massive amount of money, and it also introduced a winning, diverse cast to accompany the holdovers. Having paid homage to tradition, that cast had the potential to pick up the mantle from Han, Luke, and Leia and put its own stamp on Star Wars in the next two films. Rian Johnson’s sequel, The Last Jedi, was indebted to the original trilogy too, but it wasn’t faithful to a fault. Johnson made Luke a reluctant teacher who wanted the Jedi order to end, decreed that Rey’s parents were nobodies, and hinted at hidden depths to the Force. Whether because The Last Jedi didn’t make as much money as The Force Awakens or because a change-averse segment of the fan base objected to Johnson’s reimagining of the franchise’s formula, cowriting and directing duties for Episode IX passed back to Abrams (by way of Colin Trevorrow), who soon set about erasing any trace of The Last Jedi’s swerves away from The Force Awakens. (OK, he kept the porgs.) Each director handed on the baton, and the next one threw it over his shoulder and went in a different direction. In The Rise of Skywalker, the Emperor returns (although he never really left). This time, his toys are Star Destroyer–sized, but they’re still capable of destroying planets. Lando returns, too, as do Wedge Antilles and the second Death Star. Rey learns that she’s Palpatine’s granddaughter, and the movie builds toward a finale that almost perfectly, pointlessly parallels Return of the Jedi’s. As the Rebels mount a desperate assault on an unstoppable superweapon that’s about to become fully operational—thanks to a landing party that targets the weapon’s obvious vulnerability so that a fleet led by Lando can take it out—Rey, Ren (now Ben), and Palpatine duel in a throne room. Rey (the Luke analogue, wielding Luke’s lightsaber) resists temptation, Ben (the Vader analogue) rejects the dark side and helps her, and together, they overpower Palpatine (again). Ben dies and becomes one with the Force, and Rey escapes and rejoins the victorious Rebels (in the same X-wing that Luke flew). Then we watch Ewoks celebrate, just for old times’ sake. Also, it turns out that Poe Dameron was a spice smuggler, because now that he sometimes flies the Falcon, he may as well have had Han Solo’s old job. The movie’s main problem isn’t that it’s overstuffed, frenetic, and crammed with rushed character introductions and inelegant exposition, products of Abrams’s desire to systematically dismantle the legacy of The Last Jedi and cram his own middle film into the final one. It’s that Abrams isn’t replacing The Last Jedi’s ideas with any of his own. He’s borrowing liberally from the past that The Last Jedi’s Kylo was desperately trying to kill. Yes, Rey chooses to adopt the Skywalker surname, and yes, she wields a yellow lightsaber at the end, presumably symbolizing a fresh start for the Jedi. Ultimately, though, this is a rehash of the same old story, except that its sentiments are heavier-handed and its twists are more foreseeable the second time around. The reveal of Rey’s parentage isn’t nearly as affecting as the reveal of Luke’s, both because it’s predictable and because there’s no prior relationship between her and Palpatine, as there was with Luke and Vader. The Rise of Skywalker assures us that determined underdogs can band together to defeat tyranny, that it’s essential to maintain hope in the face of hardship, and that darkness is redeemable and temptation can be tamed, but we could draw the same lessons from Lucas’s films. What did the ending of this trilogy teach us that Star Wars didn’t decades ago?  When Disney purchased the franchise from Lucas, it seemed like a no-lose situation. Best case, we’d get more good movies, and worst case, the new movies would be bad but the old ones would be unaffected. Now I’m not so sure. The Rise of Skywalker works hard to reverse The Last Jedi’s decisions, but by redoing the original trilogy, it also unintentionally lessens the significance of the first six films. What about the prophecy that Anakin was the Chosen One who would destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force? If he didn’t destroy the Sith, the balance he brought lasted only 30 years, and his last-second redemption didn’t stop his grandson from wanting to be just like Darth Vader, what good did he do? Did we all endure the prequels for nothing? Nor is there any real reason to think that Rey’s triumph will change anything in a more lasting way. We know the Emperor has died and come back before, so what’s to stop his essence from inhabiting another body on another secret Sith planet? The Skywalker bloodline may have ended with Ben, but the Palpatine clan could continue through Rey or other undisclosed offspring. If Rey starts training a new generation of Jedi, one of them could turn, too, and the cycle of suffering could begin again. This entire trilogy is based on the disheartening idea that the happy ending of the original trilogy wasn’t a lasting solution: War soon broke out again, just as bad as before. There’s no fundamental difference between the endings of Episode VI and Episode IX, so why would this latest peace stick? This was all avoidable. If Abrams had honored Johnson’s contention that Rey didn’t come from special stock instead of launching a creative tug-of-war, then for once, a Star Wars hero really would have had humble origins: no immaculate conception, and no famous father or grandfather. That would have sent a more inspiring message than any of the Resistance’s platitudes about hope and friendship. The aggressive retconning of The Last Jedi did away with that possibility, but even still, Abrams could have broken new ground; maybe Rey and Kylo could have challenged the traditional binary conception of the Force and found a balance that blended dark and light. A radical reimagining of the last act of the trilogy would have been even more effective following The Force Awakens, but Abrams was content for that sameness to extend right through to the twin suns in the saga’s closing scene. It’s demoralizing that Lucasfilm’s brass believes fans will accept only one version of Star Wars. It’s even more demoralizing that they might be right. But even fans who found The Last Jedi jarring may reject Rise’s hand-me-down story. There was no need for Palpatine to appear in this movie: The central Rey-Kylo conflict, and the battle between the Resistance and the First Order, could have carried the film. The Emperor was an interloper with no place in this story—which somehow remained true even after Rey’s lineage was revealed—but Abrams was determined to retell the same story we’d seen before. Instead of serving as the culmination of the Skywalker saga, then, The Rise of Skywalker undercuts and diminishes it. Chewie got his medal, Disney will make money, and Abrams gets to say he shot a scene on Tatooine, but what did Star Wars fans get from the final installment of the story that started in 1977? A shot of nostalgia that soon wears off, and a lasting lack of fulfillment. That’s one wound that even the Force can’t close. Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing?

"Dec 23, 2019"," At the media screening of what appears to be the last Star Wars film, a brief shot of the Scottish actor Denis Lawson at the controls of a Rebel Alliance fighter flashed up on to the screen, and I – along with everyone else of a certain age – let out a little cheer.  As events – that took place, of course, ‘a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away’ – headed towards their climactic conclusion, we were indulging in the Star Wars equivalent of virtue-signalling, our cheers indicating that we were there when Lawson made a similarly brief appearance in the original film in 1977.  I’m not done with Lawson yet. He’s also the uncle of Ewan McGregor, the Scottish actor who played the younger Obi-Wan Kenobi in the now largely uncelebrated prequels, the character made famous by Alec Guinness in the original trilogy and who introduced us all to the Force. And I mention old Obi-Wan… no, not because he makes a surprise return; he doesn’t. Shame. But all sorts of other old characters do. In the end rather too many, in a film that often looks great – watch out for the spectacular sequence combining the wreckage of a Death Star and toweringly stormy alien seas – but is so complex and convoluted story-wise that the real challenge is just keeping up. Chief among those returning – and I mention this only because it’s been much anticipated and he appears very early – is evil Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious.  Most of us thought he’d died at the end of Return Of The Jedi but apparently not. He’s been hiding out on a Sith stronghold, quietly bigging up ‘the dark side’. Still, nice to see another Scottish actor, Ian McDiarmid, returning to the fold. Leading the forces of good is Rey (Daisy Ridley), who’s spent the time since The Last Jedi working on her Jedi powers. She is certainly feeling the Force these days and goes into battle on the Resistance’s behalf aided and abetted by former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac).  It’s a trio that very obviously replicates the original one of Leia (Carrie Fisher), Luke (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). And, oh yes, all the much-loved droids – C-3PO, R2-D2 and BB-8 – are back too, along with Chewbacca. Fisher, of course, died in 2016, but thanks to technical wizardry she’s back again here, with Leia effectively taking over the same role – as Rey’s mentor – that Leia’s brother, Luke, had in the last film.  But while I was massively moved by Fisher’s original return to the franchise in The Force Awakens (when she was still alive), and quite moved by her first posthumous appearance in The Last Jedi, this latest and over-contrived return from beyond the grave left me entirely dry-eyed.  All Star Wars films need a baddie, and here, while Palpatine is literally hanging around in the dark, it’s Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Han and Leia, which – for those who know their franchise bloodlines – makes him Darth Vader’s grandson.  Even if the only Star Wars film you ever saw was the original, you know that can’t be good. Ah, but who else can he bring over to the dark side? Ridley has improved a lot since her first appearance in The Force Awakens and now makes a thoroughly convincing contemporary heroine, although she’s certainly helped by having an actor of Driver’s undeniable quality to work against. But this is a film that – in its determination to tick so many franchise boxes, please so many different fan bases and tie up so many loose ends – eventually takes a rather too complex path towards the inevitable ending.  Until I saw the film version of Cats I’m pretty sure I’d never heard the word ‘Jellicle’, but by the time I came out I seemed to have heard it more than 100 times and still didn’t know what it meant.  Turns out it’s a type of street cat, invented by T S Eliot, whose collection of poems, Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats, provided the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical. I’ve never seen the musical on which the film is based, and this did little to make me regret that choice. I didn’t mind the digitised half-cat, half-human visual effects hybrid that caused such upset when the first trailer was unveiled.  Not least because dancer Francesca Hayward makes the prettiest cat/human hybrid you’ll probably ever see, not to mention the most graceful – but the lack of narrative and the thinness of the lyrics took their toll. I am well aware that millions of you think otherwise. So, warning fellow sceptics that this is a sung-through musical with no speaking at all, I can say that early on there are some poor songs and some distinctly indifferent singing but things improve.  Judi Dench and Ian McKellen join the feline fun, the dancing gets significantly better and the likes of Jennifer Hudson and Taylor Swift do wonders for the vocals. Goodness knows what the Oscar-winning Gary Oldman is doing in this derivative and violent thriller about a Nikita-style motorcycle courier (Olga Kurylenko) whose job it is to keep a star witness alive. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," For anyone who missed its theatrical release or just wants to revisit it, I'm happy to announce that ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" has arrived to numerous digital platforms. No spoilers here, there's so much else to highlight in the George Lucas initiated, iconic ""Star Wars'"" adventures as the Resistance once more courageously faces off against the First Order. Understandably, director/co-writer J.J. Abrams reports intense apprehension taking on this monumental task, the ninth chapter and the last in the latest trilogy. At the helm, Abrams and the hundreds who contributed their artistic and technical talent to this much-anticipated endeavor present a worthy addition, possibly conclusion, to the saga. The flawless editing flashes through the breathtaking action sequences with zing and flair, animating skirmishes as well as most fans' blood pressure. Cinematographer Dan Mindel elegantly alternates literally and symbolically bright scenes with darkly ominous ones. John Williams' so familiar score still summons excitement. And the story bobs and weaves through expected and some unexpected moments. There are, as there must be, stormtroopers who still can't shoot worth a darn, lightsaber duels that defy all logic (as we want), and imaginative new and familiar animals and characters. A metaphorically important glass tetrahedron figures in along with the critically important, evil Emperor Palpatine, Sith lords, and, of course, Kylo Ren, Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, C-3PO, BB-8, R2-D2, and more. Kudos to Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, and Adam Driver for solid, superb performances. In addition to just having fun with the ride, embedded in the pervasive mayhem and conflict, what I respond to in all the Star Wars films is strong thematic content, including mythological references and invitations to reflection, if you're so inclined. Relationships with family and friends, dignity, what's worth committing to, reconsidering values and choices: all these themes question the essential identity of each individual. In a galaxy far away, we should feel comfortable with such examination in a charged, high-spirited environment. Let's hope we return to Earth a better person for ourselves and our world. ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is available for purchase or as a digital download on numerous platforms. Check listing on Vudu, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and more.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019"," I've said this before but it's worth repeating – Star Wars has a special place in my heart.  The opening scroll is one of my earliest and most distinctive movie memories.  I remember watching it as a kid for the first time in a movie theatre and thinking that the world would never be the same again.  I wasn't wrong.  Over 42 years and eight films, the saga has become an outsized cultural entity with a key place in movie history and a vice-like grip on our collective imagination.  With The Rise of Skywalker, the story that George Lucas started on May 25th, 1977 finally comes to an end.  It is, as director J.J. Abrams, said the 'trilogy of trilogies.'  The Rise of Skywalker had to be the ultimate grand finale.  Sadly, the film is much less. In The Force Awakens, Abrams created a seamless blend of nostalgia and newness.  He was able to inventively remind us of everything we loved in these stories and yet take them into a new direction. But in The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams and Oscar-winning co-writer Chris Terrio are unable to find this sweet spot. Instead, the film feels like a fatigued rehash, designed to cater to everyone.  Once again, the brave Resistance Warriors go up against seemingly insurmountable odds embodied by the gargantuan fleet of the evil Final Order.  Characters we have both loved and been terrified by make a comeback. There are cameos and journeys to exotic planets to find a Sith artefact.  Of course, the future of the galaxy is at stake.  We are repeatedly told – if this mission fails, it was all for nothing. The plot is frantically busy and yet little feels urgent.  Several plot twists are convenient rather than organic.  Don't ask questions about how or why something happens because the logic is decidedly lax.  And this is a small detail but I've never understood why villains laugh while unfolding their nefarious plans – surely in other galaxies this cliché doesn't exist? What holds up are the characters of Rey and Kylo Ren – fierce, fabulous warriors who are fighting forces external and internal.  The struggle between good and evil plays out both in the sprawling galaxy and in their hearts.  Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver are terrific.  They give the film its emotional core.  Building on what director Rian Johnson started in The Last Jedi, Abrams creates a deep, sexually provocative bond between them.  In one scene, they are fighting each other on top of the wreck of a space ship, while giant waves swirl around them.  It's beautiful.  It's also sexy almost as though the lightsaber duel was some sort of foreplay. Visually The Rise of Skywalker is a marvel.  The cinematography is by Dan Mindel and the production design by Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins. The colours, planets and showdowns between tiny, insect-like space ships and massive, hulking ones are all wondrous.  The unforgettable soundtrack by John Williams also lifts the material – in places, it's the only thing infusing energy into the convoluted narrative.  But ultimately, the demanding length of 142-minutes exposes the storytelling, which remains serviceable but hardly inventive or singular.  There isn't enough voice or heart. The Star Wars universe guarantees a minimum satisfaction – there's always some joy in watching the cuddly creatures, the cute robots and characters like the dashing pilot Poe, the charming ex-Stormtrooper Finn and of course the majestic Princess Leia, who returns thanks to the discovery of unused footage that fit the narrative.  But The Rise of Skywalker never rises to its destiny.  It's uninspiring and what could be more heart-breaking than that?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," GOVERNMENT CAMP, Ore. (AP) — Firefighters doused a late-night fire at Oregon's historic Timberline Lodge — featured in Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film “The Shining” — before it caused significant damage. The fire Thursday night was confined to the roof and attic of the lodge, 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Portland, and it may have been caused by embers from the large stone fireplace, the lodge said in a Facebook post. Damage appeared “somewhat minimal,” it said. “Timberline employees, Hoodland Fire, Clackamas County and Gresham first responders did an amazing job,” the lodge said. “The process, communication and containment saved the Historic Timberline Lodge from what could have been a much worse outcome.” No injuries were reported. Guests were provided other accommodations and the lodge was closed until further notice. The Mount Hood ski area was also closed Friday. Filmmaker Radu Jude, a provocateur who’s been compared to both Jean-Luc Godard and John Waters, wraps his pointed political message in a rude, raucous circular road trip. The results are discombobulating but difficult to ignore. Angela (the absolutely indelible Ilinca Manolache) is an overworked, underpaid, sleep-deprived production assistant for a sketchy film company. Her horrible bosses are currently working on a workplace-safety film commissioned by a multinational corporation based in Austria. The rudimentary storyline — Do Not Expect is more about attitude than narrative — takes place over two of Angela’s 18-hour days and involves her driving all over Bucharest to record audition videos of people injured in job-related accidents. Ilinca Manolache plays Angela, a film production assistant who spends most of her workday in her car, in the tonally deranged Do Not Expect Too Much From the End of the World. They say laughter is the best medicine. Throw a little song-and-dance into the mix and you get Larry Saves the Canadian Healthcare System — an 11-part web microseries that humorously addresses Canada’s ailing medical system through music and satire. “It’s about starting a conversation,” says writer-composer Kreindler, who has a PhD in social psychology. “Whether you’re a health-care provider or just someone curious about the system, I want viewers to come away feeling empowered to hold our elected leaders accountable for addressing the underlying issues.” Producers of ""AntiDiva: The Confessions of Carole Pope"" say production is underway on a feature-length documentary that explores the career and life of the 78-year-old ""queer maverick."" Pope is one half of Toronto new wave act Rough Trade, whose 1981 single ""High School Confidential"" pushed boundaries on Canadian radio with its suggestive lyrics about lesbian desire. The movie, which opens Friday across Canada, tells the true story of a young nurse who risked her life to shelter a dozen Jewish people during the Second World War. It was shot in the Polish cities of Warsaw and Lublin in 2022 as Ukrainian refugees were fleeing into the country during the Russian invasion. “Being next to Ukraine, we felt the ramifications of the war with soldiers and refugees being in our hotel. It was so hard to just be surrounded by that every day and it was hard to detach from a reality that's just so close to ours,” says the Montreal-based actor in a video interview.  “It was like a constant reminder of how important it was to do this movie. Genocides like that keep happening and stories like these need to be told.” Winnipeg filmmaker Guy Maddin is finally going to the Cannes Film Festival, his first trip to the prestigious event on the French Riviera, in support of the feature film Rumours, co-directed by a local triumvirate that includes Evan Johnson and Galen Johnson. It is not technically the first Maddin film to play the festival. To his surprise, The Saddest Music in the World helmer learned a few days ago that his short The Heart of the World played Directors Fortnight at Cannes in 2001. As the political situation in the United States becomes increasingly fraught and divisive, the release of a movie about an American civil war set in the near future could be seen as an explosive, maybe even irresponsible act. Civil War is angry, urgent and important, but its explosion is carefully controlled. Viewers expecting a Blue State-Red State smackdown that will fire up their tribal affinities will be disappointed. English writer-director Alex Garland has constructed a potent warning that forces the audience to confront the horror and waste of war, while deliberately withholding information on the rights and wrongs claimed by either side. At a key point in Civil War, a newbie photographer talks with the central character, combat-hardened photojournalist Lee (Kirsten Dunst), about how she can remain a neutral observer in the middle of some of the world’s bloodiest conflicts. LAS VEGAS (AP) — With reports and rumors swirling about possible mergers and bids to acquire Paramount, the film studio put its best foot forward for theater owners at CinemaCon on Thursday. The historic studio announced a new film with Oscar-winning “La La Land” director Damien Chazelle, a “G.I. Joe/Transformers” crossover and that Glen Powell will star in Edgar Wight’s “Running Man” reboot.  Paramount CEO and President Brian Robbins also teased some more that are in development, including a Bee Gees film from Ridley Scott, a new comedy from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, a “Star Trek” origin story, a new “Scary Movie” and an R-rated live action “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Last Ronin” as well as an animated “Mutant Mayhem” sequel. They also brought out stars like Chris Hemsworth and Lupita Nyong’o to talk about their upcoming films, with video messages from Scott, Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal, who helped introduce new footage from “Gladiator II.” Organizers announced its lineup Thursday, with Cronenberg's ""The Shrouds"" among 19 films competing for the Palme d’Or at the festival in the south of France, which runs from May 14 to 25. Starring Vincent Cassel, Diane Kruger and Guy Pearce, the Torontonian's horror film tells the story of a prominent businessman who invents a controversial technology that helps people monitor their deceased loved ones. The film is bound for Canadian cinemas later this year. The makers of the influential 2008 documentary “Food, Inc.” never planned to make a sequel. They figured they’d said it all in their harrowing look at a broken, unsustainable food system — a system led, they argued, by a few multinational corporations whose monopoly squeezes out local farmers, mistreats animals, workers and the soil itself, and makes all of us less healthy. But 16 years after that Oscar-nominated film, they’re back with “Food, Inc. 2.” What happened? Well, first of all, the pandemic — an event that both strained our food system and revealed its precariousness, they say. Also, the filmmakers suggest, it was perhaps naive to assume that informed, ethical shoppers could alone reverse such an entrenched narrative. “You can change the world with every bite,” the first film had argued, urging consumers to buy local and organic, patronize farmer’s markets, demand healthy school lunches and most of all, read labels and understand what they're eating. Now, much of that is happening. But some problems have worsened, and new ones have emerged. “We really thought we could change the system one bite at a time,” says investigative author and producer Michael Pollan (""The Omnivore's Dilemma""), who's back with frequent commentary along with fellow author/producer Eric Schlosser (""Fast Food Nation""). “As important as that is, it’s not enough.""

"Dec 23, 2019"," FOR a film franchise that once prided itself on its ability to take risks and confound expectations, itâs somewhat disappointing to find that the final chapter of the Star Wars Skywalker saga lacks courage. George Lucasâ game-changing original, for instance, defied pre-release predictions that no one would see it by becoming one of the most popular films of all-time, paving the way for the eight films and countless spin-offs that continue to follow. Its follow-up, The Empire Strikes Back, subverted every expectation by fully embracing its dark side, allowing the good guys to lose, and dropping in a gut punch of a twist. If it took the franchise another few films to rediscover its edge, then at least Rian Johnsonâs divisive (but utterly superb) The Last Jedi appeared to be restoring balance to the force that is Star Wars by continually toying with and subverting expectation, while setting up a myriad of possibilities for future instalments. Alas, the backlash to that film from certain fans who were put out by being taken out of their comfort zone has caused the creative forces behind the franchise – from head honcho Kathleen Kennedy to returning director J.J. Abrams through to co-writer Chris Terrio – to bottle it. The Rise of Skywalker is a film designed to play it safe and keep the fans happy. If anything, itâs exactly the kind of theme park ride that Martin Scorsese lambasted Marvel for earlier this year. A carefully constructed product designed with box office in mind, rather than artistic value. Thatâs not to say itâs a disaster. It is a fun ride. But the decision to pander to fan preference backfires and prevents the saga achieving the great ending it arguably deserves. The Rise of Skywalker is merely enjoyable. To go one step further, itâs a film of great moments rather than a coherent whole. And part of the problem lies with its decision to bring back one of the primary characters from its past: The Emperor (played once again by Ian McDiarmid). Teased in the trailer to admittedly intriguing effect, The Emperorâs return sets in motion this particular story as he calls upon Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to step up to the mantle long since vacated by his grandfather, Darth Vader. He must start by killing the scavenger, Rey (Daisy Ridley).  But Supreme Leader Ren has his own plans for Rey, who is herself training in the ways of the Jedi in a bid to finally understand her powers and discover who she really is (the ongoing question of her parentage is answered).  The Princess Leia-led resistance, meanwhile, aim to mount one final stand so long as they can rally enough support, and so despatch Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) on a mission to find a hidden Sith planet. The ensuing adventure finds Abrams throwing literally everything at the screen, from crowd-pleasing cameos to rip-roaring set pieces, in a bid to give fans the ultimate rush. And to be fair, there are some great sequences, especially early on, which are backed by eye-popping visuals and some great performances. Ridley and Driver, in particular, are given plenty to do and their respective journeys arguably provide the most entertaining part of the film – and the most uncertainty.  Ridley, for her part, imbues Rey with a steely, kick-ass resolve thatâs nicely tempered by her continued fear and uncertainty surrounding her past and her pull towards the dark side. But Driver remains an enigmatic presence, too, wrestling just as convincingly with his inner demons. The film also serves as something of a love letter to Carrie Fisher, whose presence is keenly felt throughout. Her scenes – shot using outtake footage – carry an air of poignancy. But – and this is a big but – Abramsâ film just doesnât gel together as a pleasing whole. If anything, it feels lazy. There is no attempt to explain how the Emperor has been able to return (it just hasnât been hinted at), while his decision to repeatedly riff on past story strands (a la The Force Awakens) actually cheapens the supposed reveals and leads to a surprising lack of emotional investment. No matter what you think about The Last Jedi, it did consistently deliver surprises. Abrams return does not, right down to a mid-section of the film that involves the fate of one beloved character. But then Abrams has always been a better imitator than an innovator, as evidenced by his fan-pleasing Star Trek films and his Spielberg homage Super 8. With The Rise of Skywalker he tries to pay homage to past events and revisit popular characters without necessarily allowing that to make sense. Hence, the final third of the movie descends into something of a mess, with contrived character resolutions mixing with repetitive set pieces and situations. The self-referencing becomes tiring; the nods to better movies (including Avengers: Endgame) self-defeating. Rather than delivering a truly exhilarating climax, The Rise of Skywalker merely constructs an OK one. It’s a missed opportunity in a lot of ways.",NEUTRAL

The hiss of sizzling butter and prospect of broiled dry-aged beef prompts salivation for blocks over. Look through the nostalgia though. The steaks have greyed; they’re chewy. The New York Times shamed them with a zero-star review, chastising the restaurant for riding on former glories. In a galaxy far, far away, there’s a coarse comparison to be had. A Star Wars film, traditionally, evokes excitement and wonder. This time, the glow of nostalgia has long since faded. The toxicity of fan clubs battling over The Force Awakens vs. The Last Jedi has soured the show. So is it a surprise that, rather than boundaries pushed, we’re left squarely in the middle – on entry number nine? There are good parts. Back at the helm, J.J. Abrams uses his skill for efficient, eye-catching blockbuster cinema to good effect. There is undoubted fun here, whizzing and whooshing between asteroids and battleships. Adam Driver sells Kylo Ren’s character arc well, and Oscar Isaac brings much-needed spice. But there’s a chewy, gristlier edge to this largely competent dish. Something even rose-tinted glasses can’t mask. Its race to undo elements of The Last Jedi, skipping from MacGuffin to MacGuffin, makes for uncomfortable viewing. The omnipresent winks at the audience pull a sharp handbrake on any innovation the film may attempt, forcing the creativity to exit stage left. Far from reprehensible, The Rise of Skywalker manages initially to evoke frustration, which evolves to a profound apathy defined by questions of what could’ve been. The third Star Wars saga is over. It is what it is. It’s simply not the series anyone hoped it would be. The steak’s fine. Maybe a bit overdone for now. SYNOPSIS: The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron’s journey continues.

"Dec 23, 2019"," More than 40 years afterÂ Star WarsÂ changed the landscape of cinema forever, the final chapter of The Skywalker Saga has finally been delivered withÂ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Though the new trilogy features many of the well-loved characters from the original films, it has still had its share of troubles, including the hotly debated fan reception of Rian Johnsonâs Episode VIII,Â The Last Jedi. However, The Rise of SkywalkerÂ sees Episode VII director J.J. Abrams back in control of the franchise, and what he delivers is a conclusion chock full of callbacks, references, and meticulously engineered âwowâ moments that culminate in a final product that sadly feels just too safe. Picking up after the events of the ever-so-controversial The Last Jedi,Â The Rise of SkywalkerÂ sees our heroes Rey, Finn, and Poe reunited at last as they race against time (and the looming threat of Kylo Ren) to stop the First Order and bring peace to the galaxy. Although that premise sounds about par for the course when it comes to Star WarsÂ films,Â The Rise ofÂ Skywalkerâs plot is anything but. Though itâs difficult to describe the certain kind of contravity that plaguesÂ The Rise of SkywalkerÂ without giving away major (and we meanÂ major) spoilers,Â The Rise of SkywalkerÂ is at once over-written and frustratingly lacking in tension. Although the filmâs opening crawl immediately presents audiences with a villain of monumental consequence, the film never pauses to let the implications of such a character truly sink in. Instead,Â The Rise of SkywalkerÂ is more interested in jamming in as much action as possible (a problem that also plaguedÂ another franchise finale,Â Avengers: Endgame). However, whereÂ EndgameÂ took the time to step back from its complicated plot mechanics to check in on its characters and develop an emotional core,Â The Rise of SkywalkerÂ feels completely devoid of any true emotional consequence. Sure, the pathos is there on paper, but much of it is told instead of shown. The audience is told exactly how to feel about each predicament, instead of being able to come to the conclusion for themselves. This dilemma is also a result of the aforementioned convolution of the plot. Instead of taking the time to give the heroes (and the audience) a chance ot catch their breath, the film merely leaps from once action set piece to the next, sprinkling in callbacks and cameos where the emotional substance should be. Even further hurting the film is its frusturatingly stiff dialogue. Although the humor is surprisingly on point (one of the filmâs highlights), the scenes with the biggest revelations and character moments (i.e. where dialogue matters the most) feel rigid and devoid of any natural flow. As a result, the cast has very little to fall back on, leading to a grab bag in terms of the quality of each actorâs performance. Daisy Ridley is adequate as Rey, a character who is so tangled up in the logistics of her own identity that we never learn who she truly is as a person. Had Rey been given more substantial development over the course of the trilogy, Ridleyâs performance may have had some weight here, but instead, the shallowness of the character is reflected in her onscreen appearances. Thankfully, however, Adam Driver is stellar as ever in the role of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo. His commitment to the script and willingness to push himself is very apparent â he steals the spotlight in virtually every scene heâs in. At times, one wonders if Kylo Ren was supposed to be the protagonist of the trilogy. It certainly feels like it, given how he is the only character introduced in this trilogyÂ to be fully developed. One character who did not receive such development, sadly, is John Boyegaâs Finn. Although he seemed primed to be the face of the trilogy, the second that he popped into frame in the opening shots ofÂ The Force Awakensâs trailer, Finn is undoubtedly the biggest missed opportunity of the franchise. Like the films that came before it,Â The Rise of SkywalkerÂ elects not to truly delve into the ramifications of being an ex-Stromtrooper â although his past is touched on briefly in a small scene with a new character, teasing a plot that could have given the film a much more genuine emotional core should it have been expanded. Rounding out the cast is Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), whose character seems to have gotten lost in translation betweenÂ The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker. Bizarrely, Dameron is relegated to comedic relief for the majority ofÂ The Rise of Skywalker, before being suddenly thrust into a position of power when heâs needed in the filmâs climax. Although Oscar Isaac sells his lines with gusto and provides many of the filmâs funniest moments, the character canât help but feel like a half-baked Han Solo. Just as Abrams asked major questions inÂ The Force Awakens, he answers them inÂ The Rise of Skywalker. However, the resolution of such burning questions tends to feel like the filmmakerâs idea of what the fans would most want to see, as opposed to what would best serve the narrative and emotional arcs the film is trying to tell. The ending is satisfactory in that it provides closure, but as previously mentioned, nothing truly feels earned. The same goes for the filmâs cameos; although Billy Dee Williams is delightful as Lando Calrissian, his presence in the film is utterly pointless and exists only for applause from moviegoers when he first appears onscreen. Sadly,Â The Rise of Skywalkerâs ending consists entirely of such substance (or lack thereof). Itâs the kind of perfect, glossyÂ Star WarsÂ finale engineered to be enjoyed, but there is so little emotional value or purpose to the story as a whole that the conclusion just feels like a shallow imitation of the groundbreaking franchise so many hold dear.

"Dec 23, 2019"," This is a mostly SPOILER FREE review, in that I’m going to do my best to share less specifics than you’ve probably already seen on Twitter, or limit my discussion to ways in which this movie copied events from movies that have been out for years. Hey! Remember when Weezer put out that cover of “No Scrubs” that nobody asked for, and it was hollow and pointless but we all listened to it anyway because it was there, and “No Scrubs” is a helluva song no matter what, even though we’d rather have listened to the TLC version? I thought about that a lot while watching The Rise of Skywalker, the last of the latest Star Wars trilogy. I shouldn’t have, because technically Rise of Skywalker isn’t supposed to be a “cover” but an original entry in the franchise, but you wouldn’t know that from the thick layer of nostalgia smeared all over the whole thing. This is not a movie, much less a conclusion to a new story arc. This is a remix that fails to add anything new to that galaxy far, far away.  That’s not to say that the result isn’t enjoyable, because of course it’s enjoyable! It’s Star Wars! There are several outstanding action set pieces and some gorgeously realized worlds. There’s plenty of quippy banter between Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Rey (Daisy Ridley), and Kylo/Ben (Adam Driver) is a master of reaction shots. Then there’s the steady return of familiar faces that we’ve come to expect from this new trilogy. Some, like Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, were announced ahead of time, while others came as pleasant surprises. The predictability of these returns doesn’t lessen the impact of seeing them, because we are not monsters. We loved those characters before, and we can’t help but love them now. The problem is that the entire movie seems to be based on the expectation that giving the audience measured helpings of exactly — word for word, shot for shot in some cases — what we loved before is enough. This is not a problem solely for The Rise of Skywalker, of course. If you’ve been following along, then you likely already know that J.J. Abrams returned to helm this final chapter after kickstarting the trilogy with The Force Awakens (there was another movie in between — The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson — but since TROS does its damndest to ignore or overwrite everything that happened in that installment, I feel comfortable setting it aside for the time being). I’ll be honest, a lot of my issues with The Rise of Skywalker are the same ones I had with The Force Awakens back when it came out. The difference is that when this trilogy started, I was able to forgive a lot of things that didn’t make sense just because I was so happy to be back in this world. After the messy exercise in anticlimax that was the prequel trilogy, striking fresh ground was enough! So what if Rey, Finn and Poe were just hybrid characters clearly built out of elements of Luke, Leia and Han? So what if the ship Rey and Finn stole on Jakku JUST HAPPENED to be the Millennium Falcon, and so what if that ship was almost immediately boarded by, OF ALL THE PEOPLE IN SPACE, Han f*cking Solo? The implication that the Star Wars galaxy was apparently the size of a postage stamp didn’t grate so much, because it was what we wanted, on some level. Give us the new, please, but if we can have it with a dose of the old — hey, that’s a great deal. Just like the Force, it’s all about balance. Besides, that was just the beginning of the saga, and what matters is where it lands. That frustrating smallness and failure of vision grates worse this go around because, with this landing, The Rise of Skywalker proved that it had nothing new to say at all, really. All it had was callbacks to stuff you remember and plot lines you know by instinct. In the end, the fact that Rey’s bloodline is revealed (and that the twist is both familiar and yet unexpected, kind of) isn’t as disappointing as the fact that her character arc is, beat for beat, exactly like Luke Skywalker’s: A commoner from a desert planet finds a droid with an important bit of information meant for a Jedi General, then gets mixed up with the Rebellion Resistance because of it. He She also happens to be strong with the Force — very strong, in fact — and the truth of her parentage will reveal the reason for that, as well as the source of her connections to the Dark Side. She trains in the use of her powers but is unable to complete her training before another galactic threat draws her away to join the fight. In the end, she ultimately has to choose whether or not to surrender to the Dark Side in order to save her friends, though at the last moment help arrives from the redemption of an unlikely ally. Ultimately there is no twist on this hero’s journey that makes it anything other than a retread, to the point where Rey’s actions along the way have less to do with her character motivation and more to do with whatever will justify her standing before that double-moon vista, because hey — viewers will recognize that shot! (And when The Rise of Skywalker stops plundering the original trilogy and starts stealing directly from The Force Awakens, I felt like I was standing in the dumbest hall of mirrors ever.) While The Last Jedi was, shall we say, contentious, it understood that Star Wars is a franchise built on an entire history of mythology, of archetypes and messages that resound with audiences — and it sought to ADD to it. After all, there was no Star Wars for A New Hope to reference when George Lucas made it. With The Last Jedi we got fascinating and unexpected new characters, from Rose to Holdo, and we got a version of the Resistance/First Order struggle that didn’t fall back on yet another planet-killing device to be thwarted. Evil can take a lot of forms, and so can good, and hope can be found in the complexity of the shared struggle we all face to choose a path and stay on it. Instead The Rise of Skywalker, and even The Force Awakens, mistakes the power of mythology for the power of the Star Wars mythology solely, and fails to look beyond it. Yes, Skywalkers and Kenobis, Jedis and Siths, Rebels and Empires, they are all important to the Star Wars story — but Lucas laid the groundwork for an entire GALAXY FAR, FAR AWAY, and there’s got to be more there there. There’s a moment when Finn, a former Stormtrooper, talks with a new character named Jannah (Naomi Ackie), who also was a former Stormtrooper, and you realize that actually Stormtroopers have been defecting (rebelling) all along — because they’re all kidnapped children who have been reprogrammed to be cannon fodder. Now, I’m not saying that watching a planet blow up is a bad way to convey evilness, but isn’t stealing and brainwashing kids also evil, and also worth exploring? Why tell us the same story we’ve seen before, over and over again, when you’ve got new ones waiting to be told? So yes, The Rise of Skywalker is disappointing — not because it’s bad, but because it could have been great, and not because I hate Star Wars but because I’ve loved it my whole life. I loved it the first time it told me this story, and I love it enough to want it to tell me MORE stories, not THE SAME stories. I love Han, and Luke, and Leia, and that will never change — but I also fell in love with the unique trajectories this trilogy’s new characters had, until they were forced back into boxes determined by the franchise’s past (and don’t even get me started on poor, wasted Rose, who does return… and that’s about it). This final chapter gave me plenty of familiar pleasures, but it didn’t give me a single thing I haven’t seen before — and just when it almost seemed like it was going to trip into something unexpected, a hint of romantic tension or of conflict or a Keri Russell all dressed up like a Space Power Ranger, it pulled back so fast it gave me whiplash. The movie is about as emotionally resonant as an underwater tambourine. ",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2019"," Critiquing The Force Awakens (Abrams, 2015), I wrote, “While Abrams has breathed life into a dying saga, is its prolonged life anything more than indulgence for either those behind it or we, its audience? Star Wars belongs to a period when films looked and felt a certain way, and were a collection of films loved for their imperfection. One must fear that The Force Awakens’ endurance and attempt to belong outside its time may still not end well, despite the fact Abrams has awakened in the saga something that defies absolute indifference towards it. But the film is merely the first step in a bigger journey, and only at the conclusion (?) can this expansion venture perhaps be adequately judged or critiqued.” 
Timing can determine the fate of a film, knowing how to tell the story is crucial. The release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (Abrams, 2019) delivers a blow of humility to its director, just as Star Wars: The Last Jedi (Johnson, 2018) did to its filmmaker. It’s interesting how these two revered contemporary storytellers have been humbled by what they love. Their struggle to answer the question of how to tell the story post-episode VI raises another pertinent issue with such filmmaking sagas: understanding the time and space of the story itself.
 
Forty plus years is a long time, in which the blockbuster forged by the creative wills of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas with Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977) is no longer in its infancy. If it’s now synonymous with Marvel, is the continuation of the Star Wars saga an intrusion upon this powerful entity in the blockbuster canon? While in 1977 Star Wars: A Hew Hope felt magical, special even, can we expect new instalments to sustain or evoke that same feeling, when Lucas’s attempts at a prequel trilogy yielded such divisive, underwhelming, even angry responses from audiences? In hindsight, was the Special Edition trilogy in the ’90s not the last hoorah for this beloved story?  While The Force Awakens estabilised the franchise, Johnson’s poor middle film, the death of the Star Wars spirit, was a destabilising effort that put too much demand on this, the final chapter. The epilogue trilogy was doomed back in December 2018. Abrams has found himself in a cycle of eternal recurrence — one of stabilising the franchise. However, unlike his earlier success, the pressure this time around is too much for him to overcome. He is left only to conclude his expansion venture with what is a frustrating and unremarkable experience. The Rise of Skywalker is not without promise, and credit to Abrams for his willingness to open up the universe in a way he had previously been unwilling. From his own rendition of A New Hope, here he gravitates towards a greater emphasis on the mythology and lore of the Sith. Yet he frustratingly teases more than satisfies this tantalising prospect. This returns us to the quandary of undertaking a story because the Sith should remain mysterious, true to their shadow-like presence and the puppeteers behind events. The creation of the Sith planet of Exegol and Palpatine’s (Ian McDiarmid) references to Sith heritage awakens in us a desire to know more. While the prequel films were Jedi-centric, exploring their mythology and lore, juxtaposing this new trilogy, built around an exploration of the Sith, could have been an effective choice. This approach could have evolved and nurtured the story in an alternative way. On the other hand, an exploration of the Sith may itself be ill-advised, in spite of the prospect being a tantalising one. The Rise of Skywalker never feels like a film that knows the answer to the question raised in its predecessors; what is the overarching story of the trilogy? Instead, it simply frames episodes VII-IX as an act of indulgence. One of the biggest qualms with this final chapter is how Abrams’ direction hurts the film as a cinematic work. There seems to be a failing to understand the triangular relationship of character presence, cinematography, and sound. In an early scene, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) raises up his newly built fleet, a moment that screams cinematic. Compare this to the scene from The Empire Strikes Back (1980) when Yoda raises the X-Wing from the swamp, the frustrations between him and Luke, his apprentice, the patient cinematography and slow-building score by John Williams coalesce to create an awe-inspiring moment. And… this is a another missed opportunity in The Rise of Skywalker, thus compromising the film as a cinematic work. There are moments of promise, such as the notably eerily atmospheric scene of Rey (Daisy Ridley) standing amidst a piece of iconographic wreckage on Endor. But the director betrays impulsivity and lack of patience. What could be an iconic moment is squandered. Is this trilogy creating memories? Or is it only an act of remembrance? Cinema is imperfect, but even in imperfection, pleasure can be found, and moments worth remembering forged. Is The Rise of Skywalker an unnecessary act of remembrance that unsuccessfully tried to keep the past alive?",NEUTRAL

"Dec 23, 2019"," With Rian Johnson’s polarizing second entry, The Last Jedi, upsetting a vocal online fanbase with its prioritization of women, people of colour and humour, all eyes were on The Force Awakens director JJ Abrams, who returns to helm this final chapter. Abrams, who also co-wrote the screenplay for The Rise of Skywalker with Chris Terrio, famously leaned into the nostalgia with the first film of the new trilogy, earning both praise (for recapturing the magic of the original) and derision (for playing it safe and refusing to colour outside of familiar lines). The Rise of Skywalker unquestionably evokes The Force Awakens by sticking with familiarity: redemption arcs, large scale battles, a conventional hero’s journey and cameos from established franchise players. It’s 50% A New Hope and 50% Return of the Jedi. This means that fans of Johnson’s more playful, risky brand of storytelling will be left disappointed, as Abrams eschews anything remotely divisive in favour of re-telling the same Star Wars story that audiences have been getting for the last ~50 years. The new film opens with a crawl that immediately confirms the return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), Return of the Jedi’s villain, and recasts Supreme Leader Snoke, the villain of the two previous films, as little more than a figurehead for the First Order. The first hour or so is dedicated to an interplanetary search for a McGuffin: the Sith Wayfinder. This green triangle, which continues Abrams obsession with puzzle box narratives, will allow the rebels to locate the remote planet Exegol where Palpatine and the First Order are preparing to launch a new fleet of Star Destroyers, each armed with the ability to destroy a planet. In order to prevent this, Palpatine has tasked Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) with assassinating Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last of the Jedi, before she can complete her training under General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher, recreated from extra footage from The Force Awakens). Unlike the previous films, The Rise of Skywalker has no qualms about keeping its core cast together, so most of the new adventure features Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and BB8 tagging along with Rey. Unfortunately none of film’s new characters are significantly fleshed out and the search for the Wayfinder too often plays like the film spinning its wheels in anticipation of an inevitable climax. Abrams sticks so close to the familiar playbook that he established in Force Awakens that there are no surprises in this narrative – Kylo Ren’s tortured anti-hero receives a pale variant of Darth Vader’s redemption arc, the mystery of Rey’s high profile parentage returns after The Last Jedi seemingly shelved it and the climax is a blow for blow recreation of Return of the Jedi. These developments have been criticized as an attempt to retcon the less popular elements of The Last Jedi in order to appease a small vocal minority clamouring for what is perceived as more traditional Star Wars narratives. The focus on Kylo Ren’s salvation, the rise to power of Poe, the significantly decreased amount of screen time for Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose and a post-climax moment late in the film that is a complete character betrayal for Rey have led to criticisms that the new film was specifically written to address the outrage from the last film. Abrams was in an undeniably difficult position with The Rise of Skywalker: in addition to being responsible for wrapping up the trilogy in some kind of universally satisfying fashion, there was no way for Abrams to make both sides of the divide happy. The Star Wars universe has long been plagued by toxic fan culture on a scale unparalled by other franchises (look no further than the vitriol hurled at Johnson to this day, or the comments that drove Marie Tran to delete her social media presence). The reality is that Abrams took what he, Terrio and Lucasfilm executives likely deemed the least polarizing route, which was to return to the model Abrams used for The Force Awakens and deliver a safe, albeit bland, wrap-up that doesn’t offend anyone. This means that The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t truly satisfy anyone either. Had audiences not been tempted with more innovative and risky storytelling from Johnson, The Rise of Skywalker would undoubtedly be less frustrating. As it stands, the final entry in the Skywalker saga plays like a familiar adventure yarn with good special effects, up to and including a pat, expected ending for all of our heroes and an inevitable defeat of the bad guys. So what if there are no genuine emotional beats*, or the adrenaline never spikes, or there are no stakes? Disney’s guaranteed themselves another billion-dollar holiday product. I was lucky enough to screen the film in 3D 4DX, which turns the film into an immersive experience for audiences. 4DX is incredibly well suited for action films where viewers can experience the literal impact of bumps, scrapes and blast-offs in time to the imagery on screen. While typically the experience is more bombastic and used to reinforce hard hitting sequences in films, it can also complement smaller directorial moments, like when the 4DX chairs slowly and gently lean forward or back when Rey enters the Sith throne room or for the opening crawl. In the case of The Rise of Skywalker, the 4DX experience makes better use of key elemental components of the film that recent outings such as Terminator: Dark Fate. While there are expected jostles and shakes as the Millennium Falcon narrowly avoids collisions or ships explode, it is the film’s water sequences that stand out. When Rey and Kylo Ren battle each other atop a nearly sunken ship in the middle of a pounding storm, the 4DX water effects alternate between a light misting and full-on droplets (so much so in the latter case that I was prompted to wipe my 3D glasses down!). The other significant component that The Rise of Skywalker makes use of are flashes of light to accompany laser blasts. This is particularly evident during the thrilling heist sequence aboard Kylo Ren’s ship when our heroes fend off Stormtroopers with punctuated flashes of light accompany shots fired. A note of warning: every 4DX experience includes a warning for audiences who may be triggered by the use of flashing lights, but also motion sickness. Typically this isn’t hugely problematic because the 4DX experience is more akin to a light ride, but one specific sequence when our heroes meet up with Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) takes place aboard a slow moving caravan that rocks back and forth. Of all of the components of this 4DX screening, the gentle rocking motion (akin to being out on the water on a cruise ship) is the most challenging motion of the entire experience! The Rise of Skywalker isn’t as bombastic as other 4DX experiences, but the subtle, quieter moments work better in 4DX. For a fully immersive experience, be sure to sit in the front row: it is lightly clouded in smoke when ships crash.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019"," With director JJ Abrams returning to the “Star Wars” universe once again (taking the reins for Rian Johnson), he’s able to repeat history of generations’ past. He offers fans the final film of a three movie saga that never quite hits the high bar set by the previous films. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a great movie in its own right, but like “Return of the Jedi” it is held back due to many unfortunate screenplay inconsistencies, characters that don’t do much of anything, and blatant retconning that Abrams commits to at the expense of the story. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a very good movie and great closer to the Skywalker saga, warts and all. Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training with General Leia (Carrie Fisher), trying to understand the Force, which evades her. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), meanwhile searches the galaxy for the Wayfinder, an ancient Sith device that reveals the location of a mythical planet, which is home to Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), whose been enacting a devious master plan to control the universe. Palpatine demands Kylo Ren track down Rey to destroy her, with the Resistance fighting on fumes. Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8, and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) return, searching for help to take on Palpatine’s army, and comes into contact with an old friend of Poe’s, and tribal leader Jannah (Naomi Ackie), who join them to take down the First Order.  JJ Abrams’ direction is electric with some damn good action sequences (the gun fight in the hall was dynamite), as well as some genuinely gut wrenching character moments. I was hooked from minute one and much of the narrative’s inherent flaws thankfully didn’t detract or distract from the film’s overall excitement. Abrams has a lot of love for this universe and it shows in the way he reconciles the mythos and brings it all full circle right from “The Phantom Menace.” Everything from that point is considered canon, and Abrams is able to compensate for some retcons by drawing references from even the most lambasted films from the Skywalker Saga. Rey’s journey is absolutely epic, as is her inevitable clashing with Kylo Ren. Ren is haunting as the film’s menacing villain who is at odds with his own personal grasp for power and his remaining shred of decency that lingers. Adam Driver gives my favorite performance in the film, as his approach to Ren is just unnerving. Abrams also successfully fleshes out under developed Poe Dameron to allow for a bigger hero arc, and Oscar Isaac is a welcome return. Like “Return of the Jedi” it’s a movie that will maintain so much of its entertainment value and pop culture importance, even if it never quite sticks the landing in the end. “The Rise of Skywalker” is troublesome for so many reasons, mainly for its quick pace, numerous unresolved sub-plots, weird plot devices introduced (that dagger…), and characters that appear just to… well, do nothing at all. Rose Tico, anti-hero Zorii Bliss, droid D-O, Lando Calrissian, and yes, even Finn doesn’t have much to contribute to the overall narrative. Not to mention there are so many ideas that the movie never clarifies for us. Who were the Knights of Ren again? Did they actually subtly imply Jannah was the daughter of a character in the movie? What did Finn want to tell Rey? When did they discover Lightspeed Skipping? Why didn’t anyone ever think to ask C3P0 if he knew Sith? Who programmed it in to droids? That said, “The Rise of Skywalker” promises to keep fans talking for a very long time, especially with Disney and Lucasfilm set to expand on the universe cinematically very soon. If this is the end for the underdog heroes we met in “The Force Awakens” it’s a great one, in spite of the lingering questions we’re left with.",POSITIVE

"Dec 23, 2019"," Star Wars is such a divisive franchise, from the die-hard fans to those who swear each new installment “killed the franchise” to the casual fans who jump in and out, Star Wars means many different things to many different people. And I feel this movie is going to be the epitome of that feeling. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has the added pressure of not just continuing a long-running series but ending the saga of the Skywalkers giving way to new stories in the future. Does Star Wars accomplish that mission? Or does it fall to the dark side? After skipping the last movie, J.J. Abrams returns to direct the final chapter of this saga. This movie starts off with quite the bang. In the first 15 minutes, we get Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) on a rampage through space, Finn and Poe (John Boyega and Oscar Isacc respectively) escaping from the first order, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) training to become a true Jedi under the watchful eye of Leia (the late Carrie Fisher). Seriously, I felt like I got whiplash from everything that happened in this short amount of time. It’s fun and exciting, but also a bit overwhelming and muddled. From there, our three heroes set out to find a way to an uncharted part of the system to stop the plans of the returning Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). The first half of this movie is one big fetch quest; our heroes fetching an artifact to lead them to Palpatine, Kylo fetching Rey to try and turn her to the dark side, its reasoning is not all that interesting but what they do here is. We get some pretty great local and action sequences, plus the reintroduction to the always smooth as silk Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). And after 2 movies of them just being mentioned we finally get to see The Knights of Ren in action. However, I wish we got more of them since they were a pretty cool idea, aside from looking cool and menacing, they don’t do much. I think they are in two really short fights and that’s all we really get. We also dive more into Rey’s continuing struggle between light and dark. At times, it’s the most interesting part of the film and at others, the most frustrating. Normally, Star Wars has been pretty black and white about the light and the dark side of the force (in the movies that is) but here we get a lot of gray areas. She does a lot of things that she never gets any comeuppance for, she tends to run off a lot which inadvertently causes her friends to be put in danger and is never really called out for it. They come close once but that’s really it. Along with Rey, Finn and Poe also get some character development. This movie actually had all three characters together and interacting that the first two movies seemed to have advertised but not deliver on. We find out some more about Poe’s past and Finn gets some interesting expansion of what it means for a storm trouper to be free… but man, did they do my man Finn dirty. Throughout three movies they could never really figure out what they wanted to do with him. He gets some great moments here but his character motivation is just bad. They basically turn him into Ethan from Heavy Rain for most of this movie (press X to Ray). I also want to say that they did a good job with Leia’s character. While it’s pretty blatant where they spliced together what they could with existing footage before her death, they still did a pretty great job at honoring the character and giving her a proper sendoff. The action scenes are really kick-ass and the final battle is a spectacle to behold. The film does get really dark at times but it works in favor of the story… But at times, the story turns into a real mess. One of the worse sins this movie commits is that it drops storylines altogether. Certain character motivations don’t get resolved by the end and it’s a real shame since it’s present throughout the entire movie just to get forgotten about. As a “conclusion” to the main storyline of the Skywalker Saga, it doesn’t seem all that conclusive. It just feels like the end to a movie, not a trilogy and not the end of 9 movies. The end is going to be really divisive, some will love it and some will absolutely hate it. The movie also seems to undercut itself, and the trilogy, with its message of it not being important what your bloodline is but who you are as a person. Even though all the power in the universe seems to come from the same one or two bloodlines. This movie isn’t bad, it just makes some bad choices. If you hated this new trilogy, this movie isn’t going to change your mind. If you’ve been loving it so far, you may still love it or you may not. This movie is definitely a person by person experience and that’s ok. For me, the movie was pretty middle of the road. It had some great moments and had some terrible ones but I will say with certainty that unfortunately, it was the weakest of the three. If you don’t like it, go watch the original trilogy and the Mandalorian which is superb right now. But if you like it, keep on liking it. Enjoy it for what it is and don’t listen to the haters. Star Wars will live on for years to come.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," The saga ends with this somewhat watchable yet entirely disappointing entry that falls well short of the high bar set by its two top-flight predecessors, with the less-than-captivating narrative, which details Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her various cohorts’ efforts at battling a fearsome (and familiar) villain, suffering from a decidedly erratic feel that paves the way for a curiously (and frustratingly) momentum-free midsection. Scripters Chris Terrio and J.J. Abrams spend much of Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker‘s first half focused on the scavenger-like search for a certain object, and it’s clear, certainly, that the almost episodic bent of this stretch ensures that certain sequences just aren’t able to pack the engrossing, visceral punch that director Abrams has obviously intended – with the palpably uneven atmosphere compounded by Abrams rather generic approach to the material (ie this often feels like paint-by-numbers Star Wars). It’s clear, then, that movie’s tolerable vibe is due predominantly to the cast’s typically stellar work and a smattering of compelling sequences, although, by that same token, there’s little doubt that the whole thing concludes on as anticlimactic and underwhelming a note as one could possibly envision (ie that dimly-lit space-battle finale seems to go on forever). The end result is a less-than-satisfying capper to an admittedly inconsistent series of films, which is a shame, certainly, given the buildup promised by both 2015’s The Force Awakens and 2017’s The Last Jedi. (And this is to say nothing of the almost comical degree to which Abrams undoes many of the twists and character arcs within Rian Johnson’s latter picture.) Im glad JJ undid most of The Last Jedi. The worst Star Wars movie Ever. This is my favorite of the three. Mark Hamill still got screwed by JJ Abrams worse than by Rian Johnson! In Two movies Luke the only Master Jedi gets less than 5 minutes of screen time. Luke should have killed Snoke and showed up (maybe with other Jedi) to help Ray defeat all the Sith. Which is not saying much since TFA was poor copycat retelling of New Hope and TLJ is vomit inducing pile of c*ap. I so hoped that Rose character would get killed in TROS. I’m glad that the guy who gave two stars to Hiroshima Mon Amour has given this crap two and a half. Keep up the good work chief. Other morons will sure keep reading you.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," Director Rian Johnson's previous formula-bending instalment went down well with critics but seemed to upset the type of fan who has a Wookiee mask high on their Christmas lists. So this time, J.J. Abrams (who also directed The Force Awakens) has avoided every pot hole and made sure he's checked his rearview mirror before every manoeuvre. There are curtain calls for old favourites (even the dead ones), laser fights with wonky-shooting stormtroopers and slick aerial dogfights set to the rousing sound of John Williams’ legendary score. Ian McDiarmid is back as Emperor Palatine, Mark Hamill returns as Luke Skywalker and the late Carrie Fisher has been digitally regenerated to take a final turn as General Leia. The plot (don't worry, I shall tread carefully) sends Rey (Daisy Ridley), sensitive Finn (John Boyega) and daring Poe (Oscar Isaac) on an interplanetary treasure hunt for a gadget that what will lead them to the site of the final showdown. Along the way, we get several psychic showdowns between Rey and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren. The force is now so strong between these two they can swashbuckle in each other's heads. Their duels are nicely choreographed but a little repetitive. After a while, you wish they'd just get a room and set about taking over the galaxy. Still, there are some interesting elements. They rebels reach the Forbidden Desert of Pasaana in carnival season, with cute elephant-like aliens dancing with their bigger and uglier parents. The hunt then takes them to the remnants of first Death Star which has crashed in an alien sea and is being lashed by giant waves. Ridley definitely delivers as Rey too. As her character is now throughly in the grip of the Dark Side, the British actress has a lot more acting to do in this one.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 23, 2019"," The Force Awakens is about Star Wars as a feeling. It’s a loving recreation of everything that once captured the imagination, dusting off the old iconography in an attempt to evoke those same emotions again. The Force Awakens is about hearing the stir of a John Williams score, watching a battered X-Wing take on the Death Star, seeing Han Solo and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon. “We’re home”, says The Force Awakens, nostalgia writ large. The Last Jedi, meanwhile, is about Star Wars as a set of ideas. It interrogates what Star Wars is, taking it apart before putting it back together again – while, yes, subverting expectations along the way. It was a visually striking, thematically engaging attempt to grapple not just with what you love about Star Wars, but why it’s worth loving it – and how anyone can be the hero. “This isn’t going to go the way you think”, says The Last Jedi, willing to try and steer Star Wars somewhere new, ending on perhaps one of the most romantic images of the saga. The Rise of Skywalker, then, is about Star Wars as a set of internet comments and forum posts. It’s a hollow, anodyne film, constructed by committee and lacking any real vision. In fact, it’s scarcely a film at all; rather, it’s an inexplicable act of cowardice, a conscious attempt to avoid any creative decisions that might be considered brave or interesting – or, in fact, any creative decisions at all, so frequently are choices made then quickly walked back. Quite why this proved the case is difficult to ascertain; it’s not like the quality of these films particularly correlates with their profitability, after all. If the much-maligned Star Wars prequels had any cinematic merit or cultural weight – and they do – it is for their eccentricities, the sheer idiosyncratic oddity of a trilogy of films so entirely shaped by and beholden to the vision of one man. They’re not “good” films, no. But they all are worthwhile in ways that The Rise of Skywalker could never be: the prequels, at least, have an identity, have a personality. With its frantic recitation of Wookiepedia trivia and producer mandated plot points, The Rise of Skywalker is an exercise in artifice. It’s hard to imagine a more soulless, glum piece of work – made all the worse by how it positions itself as the ultimate conclusion to and final word on a series that, even at its nadir, could at least lay claim to its own set of distinctive quirks. At one point, Star Wars was a risky venture from a bold young filmmaker; now, it’s just one of several managed assets, another intellectual property mined by a monopolistic mega-corporation for maximum profit. There will be spoilers in the following review; it’s difficult to avoid a detailed discussion of the plot of The Rise of Skywalker, if only because – somehow – JJ Abrams has managed to create a film that is almost entirely exposition, while still needing more exposition. Given that the plot is more or less all the film has to offer, efforts have been taken to obscure any big revelations from herein on – that said, if you’d rather not know about Jar Jar’s cameo, probably best to stop here. What’s most striking about The Rise of Skywalker is how deeply, deeply cynical it is. As already noted here and elsewhere, it feels like it was written by reddit comments, micromanaged long past the point any individual artistic notion might survive. At times, this is simply patronising and awkward. For example, the film ends with Maz Kanata, for some inexplicable reason, giving Chewbacca a medal. Diegetically inexplicable, anyway: if you’re in the know, it clearly references a longrunning meme about the original Star Wars, where both Luke Skywalker and Han Solo receive medals from Princess Leia at the end, but Chewbacca doesn’t. In The Rise of Skywalker, this is presented entirely devoid of any context, a symptom of a wider obsession with solving plotholes that don’t really exist and providing an answer to every question everyone ever posed about Star Wars online. It’s genuinely quite difficult to tell how the scene would play to someone without that depth of immersion in the paratext – and it’s not the only scene like that. The Rise of Skywalker has very little trust in its audience, offering not exciting new ideas, but instead only the dim pleasure of recognition. That would be one thing if, say, an over signified cameo from Denis Lawson was the extent of the film’s cynicism – if it began and ended with a jaundiced litany of corporate artefacts, getting all the toys briefly out of the box before putting them right back where they belonged, it’d be a lot more palatable. No, The Rise of Skywalker is instead altogether more feeble, making lamentable concessions to the worst type of fan by sidelining Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico. After being introduced in The Last Jedi, Tran received intense racist abuse, essentially for the crime of being an Asian woman in Star Wars. Tran is in The Rise of Skywalker, yes, but only nominally – her role is limited mainly to brief chunks of exposition, and a scene at the beginning, heartbreaking for what it represents, where Rose says that she’d rather not take part in this film’s adventure, actually, because she’s got some star charts to read instead. There is a lot in The Rise of Skywalker that reads like giving up, an attempt to iron out any distinctive wrinkles Rian Johnson might’ve left behind him. If this attitude was limited to plot details, that’d be one thing – disappointing for some, perhaps, but on the whole basically forgivable, simply a by-product of serial storytelling with multiple authors. That it extended also to an open attempt, on behalf of the most powerful entertainment monolith around, to appease a group of internet racists? That is genuinely quite pathetic, and all involved should be deeply embarrassed. Also disappointing is the sheer paucity of imagination. Abrams’ previous effort, The Force Awakens, was oft accused of hewing too closely to the structure of the original Star Wars. It wasn’t an unreasonable criticism, though the film perhaps deserved a degree more leeway; it at least tried to recontextualise those familiar plot beats, to fashion something that, if not entirely new, at least offered a different spin on things. The Rise of Skywalker makes no such effort. It feels like the very worst of fanfiction – or, actually, the very worst of licensed tie-in fiction – entirely unable to step out of the shadow of what came before. There’s no effort to widen the scope of what Star Wars can be, to move beyond fetishistic reverence for Lucas’ original films (or, at least, the ones that a very narrow stratum of vocal fandom approve of anyway). For all that everyone relentless mocked the campaign to remake The Last Jedi, clearly they needn’t have bothered: here is The Rise of Skywalker, ready to retcon and refute anything anyone ever complained about in the YouTube comments section. In fact, the whole film seems paralysed by a lack of confidence, hedging against every choice it makes – The Rise of Skywalker ends up as though caught in a loop, repeating itself over and over again, taking two steps back with each one forward to make sure nothing really changes. Ostensibly, this is about tying up loose ends. That is basically nonsense. Setting aside the fact that The Last Jedi actually closes in a far neater position than The Force Awakens did – the latter ended on a cliffhanger with the three leads separated, after all – The Rise of Skywalker manages to create more questions than it actually answers. Part of this is down to its hectic pace and convoluted plotting; it’s difficult to succinctly explain, for example, quite how sloppily it’s revealed that Leia once trained to be a Jedi and had a lightsabre of her own, kept hidden for someone who might later prove worthy. Suffice to say, it’s an awkward beat, easy to forget, and ultimately only a contrivance to give Rey another lightsabre. Questions about how Palpatine survived Return of the Jedi, how he found the time to raise a family, somehow still everything about Snoke – there’s plenty that, strictly speaking, doesn’t make sense, even by the already loose standards Star Wars is held to. Whether Abrams et al thought they’d delivered a watertight script, or, less charitably, if the film was written with one eye on later Disney+ releases filling in the gaps remains to be seen. But it’s not just an issue of pacing. Rather, the problem comes because the film seems to be built around ‘moments’, around set-pieces strung together as a MacGuffin quest not a million miles away from a video game. The Rise of Skywalker feels perfunctory, like a contractual obligation – the point at which stories from a galaxy far far away might finally have been exhausted. Admittedly, yes, the film started from a difficult position. While it’s been debated exactly how much the trilogy was planned ahead of time, and how much leeway individual directors were given, one thing seems basically clear enough: the plan, originally, was for each episode to focus on a different member of the original trio. Episode VII was about Han Solo; Episode VIII was about Luke Skywalker; Episode XI was meant to be about Leia Organa, but for Carrie Fisher’s tragic, untimely death. Carrie Fisher’s role here – insofar as this slightly ghoulish, digital resurrection can be dubbed a “role” – is… awkward at best. It was always going to be, of course. A script clearly written backwards from the dialogue they had available was never going to feel especially naturalistic: it most closely resembles, as others have pointed out, that one episode of Community where they stitch together a Star Wars knockoff from a few unfinished clips of a crime drama. There’s something quite sad about the whole affair, really. Every moment Carrie Fisher, or the approximation of her they built, is on screen serves only as a reminder of who we lost; that she gets top billing at the end is nice, for a moment, until it quickly isn’t. It’s hard to earnestly suggest this was an adequate solution; sacrilege though it might’ve been, there’s perhaps an argument to be made that Leia should’ve been recast, that Meryl Streep or Stevie Nicks should’ve fulfilled the role and let the trilogy end as originally planned. (Or even, perhaps, the movie should’ve started with Leia’s funeral – and Palpatine’s apparent return from the dead been more closely tied to this, questions of life and death proving the motivation for Kylo Ren as it once was the motivation for his grandfather in Revenge of the Sith.) Even outside of that, though, The Rise of Skywalker faced a troubled production. Colin Trevorrow was let go from the project early on; the script was rewritten many times by many different writers. (It’d be interesting to know exactly when Palpatine’s return was decided on – it seems like it’s got Jack Thorne’s fingerprints all over it, given the similarities to his stageplay Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, though admittedly could just as easily have been Abrams’ idea.) In the end, Abrams came to the film late, and had less time to work on this than he did on The Force Awakens. More likely than not, the film would’ve benefitted if held to December 2020; as ever, though, commitment to shareholders supersedes commitment to making good art, and the deadline was met. That, perhaps, might explain why even the things Abrams is usually good at falter here – in contrast to the often-vibrant direction of The Force Awakens, The Rise of Skywalker offers a decidedly more muted world. For whatever reason, Abrams’ visual stylings aren’t up to his usual standards; grand space battles struggle to cohere, new planets fail to make an impact, and the final battle with the Emperor quickly devolves into a CGI mess. There’s a sense that a lot of shortcuts were taken across The Rise of Skywalker, and the film suffers for it. What’s more aggravating, though, is that this lack of ambition extends too to the characters. For all that The Force Awakens relied a little too heavily on nostalgia, it was, to its credit, conscious about not letting the legacy characters overshadow its new heroes too heavily. Here… less so. That pervasive, fawning adoration for the original trilogy often undercuts the characters themselves – when C3PO has a more coherent emotional arc than leads Finn or Poe, something has gone quite wrong. It’s frankly fascinating that John Boyega seems to think Finn was better served by The Rise of Skywalker than The Last Jedi – certainly, the promise the character held in The Force Awakens is squandered here, despite briefly touching on his origins as an imperial defector once again. It’s much the same for Poe, too, whose plotline here serves only as a suffocating attempt to make sure everyone in the audience knows he definitely did have a girlfriend at one point. That said, the character most let down by The Rise of Skywalker is Rey. Or, rather, Rey Palpatine. Surely the most compelling idea in The Last Jedi was that Rey was simply Rey; special because anyone can be, not because of who her family was. There was something quite profound to the idea that a hero could come from anywhere: there’s nothing profound about this. As Lindsey Romain has pointed out, “making Rey a Palpatine is more in service to the plot hole crowd than to the character herself” – somewhere along the line, Abrams et al lost interest in their main character, instead much more focused on imitating the Star Wars we’ve already seen before. Indeed, even if nothing else, The Last Jedi at least proved a decisive break from repeating the beats of George Lucas’ work – surely no one would earnestly argue that The Rise of Skywalker compares to The Empire Strikes Back? As it is, this final act in the story is confused at best, and incoherent at worst – not a million miles away from, say, Return of the Jedi seeing Yoda explain to Luke that, actually, his father Anakin Skywalker was still alive, and Darth Vader had in fact been lying. Admittedly, the final line, where Rey chooses to become Rey Skywalker, is nice: if The Last Jedi says anyone can be the hero, then The Rise of Skywalker is saying anyone can be a Skywalker, anyone can pick up that legacy, even if they weren’t born to it. Yes, it’s a weak echo of Steven Moffat’s Extremis, but then quite a lot of The Rise of Skywalker seems to be an effort to remind people that Moffat is quite a good writer anyway. Kylo Ren fares somewhat better – though this, largely, is down to Adam Driver’s own skill, elevating the rough material he’s given. Where he’s even given material at all, that is: for the last twenty minutes of the film, Driver actually has no dialogue at all, instead creating the Ben Solo character from small gestures and irreverent expressions alone. In the end, it doesn’t quite live up to the potential Kylo Ren represented in 2015, hewing a little too closely to the story of Darth Vader’s own redemption. Although, even on that level, it doesn’t quite work – more a Damascene conversion than anything borne of real conflict. That angsty, toxic masculinity washes away: The Force Awakens’ modern villain now instead a more familiar archetype. As with much of this film, there’s a sense that another, more interesting interpretation was lying just out of reach. In fairness, some things do shine through. The ruins of the Death Star are a neat location; a fight on an ocean moon forms a clever parallel to the iconic duel on Mustafar. Rey gets a yellow lightsaber; that’s pretty cool. Particularly striking, albeit brief, is a shot of a star destroyer falling on Jakku, not far from the wreckage of another – the one Rey called home in The Force Awakens, itself a remnant of the original trilogy. Admittedly it makes little sense, but that doesn’t matter, instead neatly underscoring the cyclical, generational nature of it all. Still at the end, it’s like poetry: it rhymes. No doubt on repeated viewings, more details would reveal themselves; a certain shot, a particular inflection, a piece of design, all increasingly worth of appreciation. Much as it struggles under the weight of ‘Star Wars’ the idea, The Rise of Skywalker will likely ultimately benefit from the fact that it will always have someone willing to revisit it, willing to find something worth celebrating. On first watch, though, the film eventually becomes entirely unmoored from questions of “quality” – it’s just pure, unrepentant nonsense. There’s some enjoyment to be had from that, certainly; this film is no doubt going to be a fixture of internet memes much like the prequels. It is, in a way, the Riverdale of Star Wars movies (although Riverdale at least has a degree of self-awareness that this lacks). By the time of the Reylo kiss, all that’s really left is to admire the film for so unwittingly stumbling into a surely endless discourse cycle that’s unlikely to leave anyone happy. With regards to the kiss itself, it’s an odd artefact; in isolation, it feels strange, somehow both inevitable and not anywhere near as electrifying as it could’ve been. Taken alongside the rest of the film, though, and it’s clearly another concession to internet fandom – albeit without realising that it’s an appeal to an entirely different group, a compromise surely neither will be pleased with. That, in the end, is The Rise of Skywalker: a cloying, even sycophantic corporate product, so desperate to be liked it never really stops to tell a story. Yes, some people will enjoy it, and honestly, genuinely: good for them. Surely one of the best defences of the prequel films – setting aside everything that might be said about their auteurist idiosyncrasies – is that the children who grew up with them really did love them, and many still do. For what are, in essence, family films, it’s hard to really begrudge anyone that. Much the same is true of The Rise of Skywalker, whatever faults it might have. At the end of the day, it’s just a movie. Disney, at this stage, isn’t so much a corporation as it is a cultural monolith. It has a monopoly on the zeitgeist. If any film franchise is too big to fail, it’s Star Wars: their quality and content ultimately has very little correlation to their profitability. Yes, dedicated fans will squabble online, but they’ll still watch it no matter what – and so will the other hundred percent of the audience. Disney didn’t need to make these concessions; Disney didn’t need to almost entirely excise Kelly Marie Tran as a gesture towards a group of vocal racists. Obviously, Disney is not and has never been a bastion of progressive values, and expecting otherwise from any company is naïve at best, but this feels rather different. So. If a company that wields as much influence as Disney feels the need to bow down to what is, essentially, the latest iteration of Gamergate… what does that mean next? This review is spectacular! You certainly know how to keep a reader amused. Between your wit and your writing, I was almost moved to start my own blog (well, almost…HaHa!) Wonderful job. I really loved what you had to say, and more than that, how you presented it. Too cool! A large percentage of of the things you assert is astonishingly legitimate and that makes me ponder the reason why I had not looked at this in this light before. Your article really did switch the light on for me as far as this specific subject matter goes.

"Dec 23, 2019"," The most disappointing thing about J. J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is how most of it is guided not by daring ingenuity but by an aversion to any form of risk. It is a stubborn retraction of the little but reverberating successes Rian Johnson managed to infuse in The Last Jedi (2017) with its hints of stark disillusionment and the apt democratization of valor and bravery within the franchise’s archaic narrative of hero worship. It frustratingly succumbs to the lowest of expectations, resulting in a whimper-like conclusion to a saga that once meant something but has proven to be just an indentured goose that will just keep on mindlessly laying golden but stale eggs. The decision does its job of allowing the franchise a stab at a tidy resolution, where all the plotlines of its main drivers, which include Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) from the middle trilogy, Anakin from the dreary first trilogy, and Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Ben Solo (Adam Driver), eventually converge in a conclusion where all its twists and turns involving good guys going bad and bad guys turning good are reduced to the propagation of the importance of lineage – which in this age of destiny as a product of individual efforts rather than family names, sends quite a backward signal. It is a glossy regurgitation of themes that fit the politics of decades ago, making the entire point of producing nine films within several decades a needless endeavor, at least in terms of shaping modern-day mythology. While the repetitive struggles of a ragtag team of rebels spanning several generations against a heartless empire offer some truly memorable surprises, both the rewards and the discourse offered by this culminating episode simply underwhelms. Despite all the expensive spectacles, The Rise of Skywalker is old and musty, unwilling and unable to evolve to suit the egalitarian attitudes of today. Remember that before Star Wars turned into the banner of commercialist Hollywood, it echoed an anti-war sentiment that reverberated in a world that was tired of real wars fought for imperialist endeavors. While Lucas’ film made use of archetypal characters and borrowed extensively from the works of Akira Kurosawa, its simplistic telling of a nobody from the boondocks of a galaxy far far away who rises the ranks to inevitably spearhead a revolution is fitting in a market that is thirsty for modern myths that contribute to a collective sentiment.  It is only in The Last Jedi that the saga felt like it was maturing, like it was being offered as a product of the times and a reflection of the moods and philosophies that have changed since Lucas cooked up the tale.  Abrams’ effort to undo the advances of Johnson’s episode, while truly unfortunate, is a demand that the very nature of Star Wars as a product is inevitable. What is truly more damning about The Rise of Skywalker is that its attempts at finding a middle ground render its bid at relevance petty and forced. The film puts the efforts of rebellion in the background, with the fate of the universe reliant on the success of the belabored and bewildering romance of Rey and Ben, and the few rebel officers like Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) who were only interesting because of whatever they symbolized, which are lost in exchange for the authority they gained within the opposition forces. Other characters are reduced to sound bites and obligatory bids for diversity.  What truly matters, however, is its end goal of establishing that the fate of the galaxy still hinges on prominent family names rather than the strength of the people. It chooses the path of least resistance, offering temporary delights in exchange for a chance to be worth any real discussion. The film opts for fantasy, for being defined by its eye-popping renderings of impossible worlds that become settings to a compelling but ultimately rote soap opera involving the push and pull of goodness and evil within fragile individuals.  Definitely, the film is worth every penny you spend for it, if the ultimate goal is to simply be bathed in sights and sounds that are truly immaculately crafted. However, spectacles are dime a dozen nowadays and it isn’t too much of a stretch to expect more from the series that started it all.  Note: Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker went on a limited run in the Philippines from December 20 to 22. It returns to Philippine cinemas on January 8, 2020.

"Dec 22, 2019"," UPDATE: April 28, 2020: Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker is available to stream via Google Play, YouTube and iTunes — and via Disney+ from Monday, May 4. Pity the fool who directs a Star Wars movie these days, even if that fool is JJ Abrams. It feels like a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away from the internet, when fans only interacted with films at the cinema and movies survived or died largely on merit alone. Back then, criticism and praise happened in private — between friends, colleagues and, occasionally, strangers at conventions. Now, films can fail before they're released. Emboldened by online anonymity and pocket-sized megaphones, devotees decry everything from casting choices to millisecond-long trailer grabs. To borrow from A New Hope, it's as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror that a woman was cast in the lead, or a stormtrooper was both black and friendly. ""Thanks for ruining my childhood"" became the catchcry for anyone who felt they didn't see the movie they wanted to and, unfortunately, studios started listening. It's in this context that the third and final film in Star Wars' sequels trilogy arrives. Reactions to Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi were as polarised as the entire franchise had seen — with some praising his efforts to reimagine swathes of lore and actually deliver something new for the first time in nearly 30 years, and others (most, even) tearing the film down. Cries of disrespect rang long and loudly as OG fans believed that their beloved characters had rejected everything they'd once stood for. Sure, Johnson dropped the ball on a number of fronts, but at least he tried something different. Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker does not try anything different. It retreats to the safest possible territory, borrowing heavily from Return of the Jedi to round out a trilogy crippled by an absence of cohesion. Like 2018's Ready Player One, nostalgia is the film's oft-used trump card, relying almost entirely on familiar visual or musical moments to trick you into thinking you're watching something clever or special. The end result is a chaotic, inconsistently paced, 142-minute package of fan service that gets a few things deliciously right and a lot disappointingly wrong. The Rise of Skywalker's best parts, as has been the case across this trilogy, stem from the relationship between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Ren (Adam Driver). As the only enduring, meaningful source of mystery, Ridley and Driver again deliver committed performances filled with emotion and raw physicality — and both deserved a far greater story. Here, they're after the same thing: the somehow-resurgent Emperor Palpatine. We say 'somehow', because at no point does the film substantially address this crucial point. At least soaps like Dynasty offered explanations when they pulled this narrative trick (it's his evil twin; he fell off a boat and had amnesia; he was in protective custody). For Abrams, Palpatine is just back. In fact, he never left. Still, it's a joy to see Ian McDiarmid reprise one of cinema's greatest villains, with his scenes among the movie's highlights. Another strength, of course, is The Rise of Skywalker's special effects. As always, they're dizzying and dazzling. The large-scale planets and battles are amazing because Industrial Light & Magic — the company that helped kick-start incredible SFX back in 1977 — continues to push new boundaries, but the imagery particularly impresses in smaller ways. The ongoing commitment to practical effects (those that actually happen live on-set), for example, and managing to not only keep Carrie Fisher on-screen two films after she died, but to ensure that Leia remains the franchise's best character. The wizardry behind these posthumous performances must give pause to all working actors; however credit also goes to the writers for holding true to everything that made Leia an iconic hero in the first place. Her lines are limited but her actions speak volumes, and the film's most emotional moments belong to her. Others don't fare nearly as well. Kelly Marie Tran's Rose, a major player in The Last Jedi, is sidelined, as are Domhnall Gleeson and Lupita Nyong'o's characters — while franchise newcomer Keri Russell scarcely appears before she's gone. Even C-3PO is on the outer, notwithstanding one touching moment. Richard E. Grant is an inspired addition, and his turn as a ruthless First Order general makes you wish he'd been there from the beginning. As for Billy Dee Williams' return as Lando Calrissian (as already spoiled in the trailers), it's among the better nostalgic flourishes. Returning to Star Wars after first directing The Force Awakens, that Abrams plays it safe is no surprise. Yes, it can be argued that a franchise this big needs to take fewer risks to ensure it resonates with the widest possible base. Just as true, though, is the fact that playing it safe is a gross disservice to a property worthy and capable of greatness. If this really is the end of this universe as we know it, then surely it would've been better for The Rise of Skywalker to try and fail than fail to try at all.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019"," There’s a line in The Last Jedi where Kylo Ren is practically addressing the entire Star Wars fandom. The suggestion to, “Let the past die. Kill it if you have to,” is good advice for a franchise perpetually in love with its own lore. The sequel trilogy was designed to introduce new characters into the mix, even as the films themselves often looked like remakes of earlier, better material. The return of J.J. Abrams to the director’s chair suggested a change in course from Rian Johnson’s mandate in The Last Jedi to let go of that which came before. The Rise of Skywalker is a film all about the past. From the many cameos to the mirroring of earlier narratives, it’s hard to even discuss the film on its own merits, for it doesn’t really have any. The Rise of Skywalker is more like a greatest hits compilation than an actual movie. Rey, Finn, and Poe were all introduced as characters with the potential to carry the franchise to fresh worlds and new adventures. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac all have obvious chemistry, characters brought together by a shared desire to belong to something greater than themselves. There could have been a point in time where a great trilogy could have been crafted all about these characters, and their adorable spherical droid companion BB-8. The sequel trilogy always struggled to juggle its many pieces. There are the old characters, the new characters, the older plot, and the minor deviations the new narratives take to differentiate themselves just enough to justify their existence. The Rise of Skywalker can’t plot its own course because Abrams never allows it to stray too far from familiar territory. It’s hard to tell your own story when you have to squeeze in so much of earlier Star Wars lore as well. The film does handle Carrie Fisher’s death quite well, making the most of mere minutes of footage left over from the previous two entries. It would be quite difficult to wrap up the “Skywalker saga” without Princess Leia. Abrams honors Fisher’s legacy in a way that feels vital to the narrative. The same holds true for most of the other legacy characters. After being mostly sidelined for the past two films, C-3PO and R2-D2 each get multiple moments to shine. Anthony Daniels gets plenty to work with as everyone’s favorite mildly annoying golden protocol droid. Billy Dee Williams brought plenty of his signature charisma to Lando Calrissian, absent from the films since Return of the Jedi. Even Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, who took over from Peter Mayhew who died earlier this year) gets a meatier plotline than previous entries. Star Wars means a lot of different things to its large fandom. There are those who appreciated Rian Johnson’s efforts to plot a new course for The Last Jedi and there are those who loathe what the film did to Luke Skywalker. Plenty of people enjoyed Abrams’ The Force Awakens, which often felt like a straight remake of A New Hope. The Rise of Skywalker understandably carries the most appeal to fans who want a nice heavy helping of nostalgia to go with their space battles and laser sword fights. The biggest problem with this entire approach is that it robs the new characters of any chance to stand on their own feet. Rey may be the hero, but this isn’t really her movie. It’s not Luke’s either, or Leia’s or Han’s, or any other possible person the film may try and make you remember. It’s the past’s movie, your childhood memories brought back to life for the sake of another ticket sold. Star Wars used to make its audiences’ collective jaws drop, with stunning technological feats. George Lucas may have no skill for dialogue, but the man knew how to take people to places they’d never been before. As a child I was blown away by the sheer sight of R2-D2 on the bridge of the Tantive IV in the very first film. The Rise of Skywalker lacks any of that wonder and awe. It doesn’t make an earnest effort to try to impress anyone. Rather, a half-hearted attempt is made to reignite the audience’s faded memories of better times with better movies. Lightning may never strike the same spot twice, but force lightning seems to only know one tired story. We’ve seen this all before. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things. Thank you to everyone who’s listened to the show over the past half-decade! We don’t do as many new episodes as we used to, but it’s always fun to catch up. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019"," Directed by J.J. Abrams.
Starring Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong’o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, Dominic Monaghan, Greg Grunberg, Jimmy Vee, and Billy Dee Williams. As Game of Thrones proved earlier this year, bringing any pop-culture behemoth to a close without rankling large swathes of the fanbase is incredibly difficult. And while Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is hardly the end of the space opera franchise – Episodes X-XII will surely be with us soon enough – there is at least a discernible desire here to tie a neat bow on the series’ legacy characters. After Rian Johnson’s prior effort The Last Jedi sharply divided fans – some re-energised by its brave, surprising choices, while others felt it strayed too far from established characterisation – there was certainly great interest in seeing how The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams would return to finish things up. And quite predictably, Abrams’ film is a thoroughly transparent, excessively reactionary rebuke to what came before, by not only clinging with a sure desperation to the series’ slushy penchant for unimaginative “everything is connected” storytelling, but actively walking back some of The Last Jedi’s more intriguing shocks. If the previous film ended with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) seemingly taking up the mantle of Supreme Leader after liberating Snoke’s (Andy Serkis) upper-body from his lower-body, The Rise of Skywalker takes its first of many sharp detours from this in the opening title crawl. Before we’ve even seen a frame of the movie proper, the titles explain that the long-dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is back, and with scarcely more than a “don’t question the details” explanation, he forges an alliance with Kylo Ren to kill Rey (Daisy Ridley) and rule the galaxy. If that sounds like the logline to a Star Wars fanfic, that’s because the vast majority of this film plays out precisely as such. Mounted as a conciliatory “apology” for The Last Jedi, Abrams – who co-penned the film with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice co-scribe Chris Terrio – scratches every last nostalgic itch the fanbase could possibly have. And yet, the result is a film that feels less a joyous celebration of one of pop-culture’s great universes than it does a hollow, soulless attempt at reinforcing the established brand. Rather than simply smooth over The Last Jedi‘s edges and forge ahead, The Rise of Skywalker doubles down on Star Wars‘ most insufferable instincts; the MacGuffin fetch quests are fetchier than ever before, the cool new supporting characters show up for minutes a-piece simply to sell some toys, and almost no fan-serving avenue is left unexplored in a half-baked attempt to mash viewers’ dopamine receptors. And while the film’s unambitious deference to both formula and iconography is unsurprising, its overall roughness absolutely is. Though there are many beautiful individual shots throughout – courtesy of Abrams’ regular lenser Dan Mindel – there’s a frustratingly frantic choppiness to the movie’s overall tenor. The opening act in particular is breathless to the point of irritation, rushing from one planet and character to the next with a mechanical expediency. Uncharacteristically for Abrams, there are even action beats rendered scarcely coherent by the overly busy editing, which along with the film’s reportedly extensive reshoots might suggest The Rise of Skywalker was repeatedly pivoted into different positions during post-production. This would also explain why the script feels so bizarrely scattershot; numerous plot threads are set up and then never paid off despite the obvious potential for them to do so, and basic character logic is jettisoned routinely in favour of a flighty, breezy space opera feel. And that’s precisely the problem with Abrams, who while a talented stylist, isn’t much of a writer, and was clearly bolstered significantly by Star Wars veteran Lawrence Kasdan on The Force Awakens. His heart-over-brain storytelling can only take him so far, and in a movie that’s supposed to in some way pay off 42 years of established lore, it is exactly the uncreative and at times purely illogical approach that many feared. If I’m being vague on the particulars, it’s because almost every scene in this movie is spoilerific, and regardless of my own apathy towards the end result, it is a cinematic monolith which should be experienced, love it or hate it, with as few extraneous details as possible. But I can say that, outside of the frequently questionable creative, the cast certainly does their level-best to keep the film afloat, and they’re sometimes successful enough. Especially entertaining are Anthony Daniels as the quip-happy droid C-3PO, whose witticisms have never quite felt this deliciously catty, while for all of the brain-breaking questions that Palpatine’s presence in the film raises, Ian McDiarmid’s velvet-voiced villainy hasn’t lost a single step. The leads all do fine enough what with they have, especially Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, who is by far the most interesting of the new generation of characters, even if his arc here is also likely to be the most divisive. And given the enormous problem created by Carrie Fisher’s untimely death three years ago, her General Leia is integrated into the film with a surprising seamlessness. By repurposing deleted scenes from the last two movies and making clever use of stand-inds and strategic lighting, it largely feels like Fisher shot her role like any other. And yes, her character is given a worthy enough send-off considering the obvious constraints the production was under. It’s fascinating to consider how the Star Wars fanbase en masse will consider The Rise of Skywalker in the future; will the haters concede that, no, it isn’t worse than the first two prequels, or will those swept up in a nostalgia-soaked honeymoon period eventually concede that, in fact, it’s just not very good? Time will tell, but on the week of release, its divisiveness is firmly noted. Whether the film works for you or not will likely depend on your own ability to roll with its sloppiness for the sake of the bigger picture, though for many, that bigger picture may simply amount to 142 minutes of condescension. Cynical and pandering in all the worst ways, the “finale” to the Skywalker Saga shamelessly walks back The Last Jedi’s bolder and less-sentimental storytelling choices in favour of lazy, unearned fan service.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 22, 2019"," In the beginning, there was the Word…or a bunch of words, anyway. They began with, “It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, striking from a hidden base, have won their first victory against the evil Galactic Empire.” Once seen, it was impossible to forget. Film historians will tell you the first blockbuster was Steven Spielberg’s Jaws in 1975. That’s true, but there’s a galaxy’s worth of difference between a blockbuster and a frickin’ phenomenon. On May 25, 1977, Star Wars changed everything. The brainchild of George Lucas erupted from theaters and soon laid claim to toys, books, music, clothing, and an absolutely godawful holiday special. For a while there, Star Wars was bulletproof. It didn’t matter that Return of the Jedi was only two-thirds of a good movie. It didn’t matter that a large number of connected novels were poorly written. Hell, it didn’t even matter that the release of the Prequel Trilogy captured the imagination of the public like a wet fart. Ultimately, it was always understood that underneath it all was a strong core, the product of a vision. Things changed in 2012 when George Lucas sold Lucasfilm for $4.05 billion to Disney. The Mouse House now oversaw his galaxy, and the legacy of his company was secure. Barely after the ink was dry on the contracts, plans were made.* Disney did what it excels at, which is pumping out content. A continuation of the Skywalker Saga began in 2015 with Star Wars: The Force Awakens. That trilogy, along with 42 years of themes, narrative, and expectations comes to a close with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Remember Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)? When last we saw him, he had assumed control of the villainous Empire…I mean, First Order, tried and failed to stamp out the Rebellion…I mean, the Resistance, and did battle with his mentor Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who was revealed to be an exceptionally sneaky Force Ghost. Have those experiences seasoned young Master Ren into a wiser and cannier opponent? They have not, and he’s still the same old lovable scamp who enjoys wholesale slaughter and counterproductive temper tantrums. After killing the hell out of a bunch of luckless chumps, Ren descends into the depths of a hidden planet. He finds Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who has been a busy little Sith lord despite the minor inconvenience of having been dead. It turns out he’s been creating clones and waiting for his long-lost heir. The plan is to activate a thing called The Final Order which will subjugate the galaxy, resurrect the Sith order, and cause everyone to have a pretty crappy day. The good news is, there’s a band of plucky rebels on hand to stop them. Yes, still. Our old pal Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been diligently training to be a Jedi, and she’s become a dab hand at yanking stuff around with the Force and swinging around her lightsaber all willy-nilly. Daredevil pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) continues to buckle swashes whenever possible, while ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) continues to have a frustratingly underwritten personality. Their leader remains Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who desperately seeks an advantage against the First Order. Due to the efforts of a spy, she just might have one. Now they must seek out a Sith artifact, the corpse of an assassin, his ship, and a mystical dagger emblazoned with clues leading them to the truth. Yep, there’s an awful lot of time spent seeking out things or people. Let’s take a moment to imagine you’re seeing your favorite band in concert. You’ve gotten good seats and the sound quality is exquisite. They take the stage, and your musicians of choice play all the hits, but only the hits. Then, a tribute band joins them onstage, and they proceed to play the hits. That’s what The Rise of Skywalker is, and it’s designed to give the fans what they want and nothing else at all. Look, I still believe that as much as The Force Awakens played it safe, it skillfully rejuvenated the Star Wars brand and was a fun time at the movies. I also believe that The Last Jedi took some big chances and did so with a high degree of skill. That film also was the most divisive film in the franchise, and going forward, the creators of The Rise of Skywalker had quite a job ahead of them. Their job was to bring audiences more adventures with characters they love, wrap up years-long storylines, deliver thrilling spectacle, and simultaneously close out a franchise while prepping audiences for more down the road. Unfortunately for them, the film that actually did all those things successfully this year is Avengers: Endgame. So that must mean I loathed The Rise of Skywalker, right? Not at all? Give director J.J. Abrams credit for consistently making terrific-looking films that are impeccably cast and feature inventive set pieces. There’s a lightsaber duel in the midst of crashing waves that’s gorgeous, and an extended sequence that would be right at home in the world of Mad Max. There were many, many moments where I caught myself thinking, “Oh, that’s cool!” Problem is, I was only affected by surface pleasures. Their screenplay feels desperate. It’s as if, with a slightly mad gleam in their eyes, Abrams and co. are vigorously fan-servicing the audience and yelling, “DO YOU LIKE THIS? WHAT ABOUT THIS? HERE’S A LIGHTSABER FIGHT AND A TON OF SPACESHIPS AND ANCIENT PROPHESIES! HERE’S EVERYTHING YOU LOVE!” Over and over they call back to the Original Trilogy, and it feels like they have so little faith in the present that they need to refer to the past. Speaking of the past, the script repeatedly sidelines, undercuts, or straight-up changes plot and character points established in The Last Jedi. In typical Abrams fashion, it also does so at high speed. By the time you’ve realized a thing doesn’t make sense, the film has rocketed you to a totally different thing that also doesn’t make sense—yet is awfully cool looking. This franchise succeeds when it melds mythic archetypes, swashbuckling adventure and, yes, low-key ripping off other movies. It’s always done so with high confidence, and if there’s one thing Star Wars should never feel like, it’s desperate. For decades, it’s been fashionable to sneer at the Star Wars movies for stilted and amateurish acting. Like many commonly held beliefs, it’s wrong. You need only look at the performances by Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver for proof. At no point are either of them phoning it in, and while they know they’re in a big-budget space fantasy, they never wink at the audience. They take the emotion seriously and deliver acting that’s layered and intelligent. Oscar Isaac’s Poe is a creature of almost pure charisma, and while he doesn’t have quite as much to do from a performance standpoint as last time out, he’s still great fun. Supporting turns from Keri Russell and Richard E. Grant are great fun, and I particularly enjoyed Joonas Suotamo’s clever performance as Chewbacca. Let’s also take a moment to mourn how, throughout this trilogy, John Boyega has been done dirty. The idea of him playing a Stormtrooper who goes AWOL and develops a conscience is a damn good one. The Force Awakens left his character in an interesting place. The Last Jedi never quite knew what to do with him and saddled him with a subplot that kept putting the brakes on the movie. That trend continues here, and Finn, unfortunately, becomes a third wheel. Boyega is a smart and creative actor who could have had a brilliant role if only the filmmakers knew how to capitalize on it. In the end, I suppose it doesn’t matter. Star Wars means a great many things to a great many people, and I don’t begrudge them a little joy this holiday season. Perhaps you’ll walk out of the theater feeling that pleasurable rush of dopamine. If so, that makes me happy. What also makes me happy is, despite the considerable disappointment I felt towards The Rise of Skywalker, Star Wars isn’t over. The cynical view to take is that it’s too big to fail, and too lucrative an IP to reject. The real view is that, right now, passionate and talented people are doing what matters. They’re devising stories,**** doing the brutally underappreciated work of illuminating the hidden corners of the galaxy, and igniting our imaginations. They’ll explore. We’ll follow. **This is subject to change, but as of this writing, The Rise of Skywalker has an 86 percent audience score and a 57 percent critics score. ***When it comes to big popular entertainment, filmmakers walk a tightrope. You have to deliver something that people enjoy. You also have to have almost sociopathic confidence in your story. I give George Lucas a perverse degree of credit for the Prequel Trilogy. He made exactly the movies he wanted to make, and he gives zero f’s if we like them or not. ****It cannot be overstated how much credit Dave Filoni is due. He’s responsible for creating The Clone Wars and Rebels TV series and is a co-creator of The Mandalorian. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 22, 2019"," Ending a Star Wars trilogy can be as tricky as destroying a Death Star, requiring a rare mix of battlefield experience and blind faith in The Force. Those, presumably, are the qualities that put JJ Abrams back in the pilot’s seat for this safe but solid series finale, after Jurassic World director Colin Trevorrow (who was originally signed to direct) failed to take control of this blockbuster ship. Turning his back on the controversies of The Last Jedi, Abrams conjures a mix of crowd-pleasing spectacle and unadventurous storytelling, steering a whizz-bang course between a series of oddly familiar set pieces as he ties up some long-running narrative threads while leaving others hanging. The result is a handsome if creaky and oddly inconsequential final film that lurches around the galaxy at light speed without actually getting anywhere, as it steers a course between the inventive and the inevitable. Back in 1983, the first Star Wars trilogy ended less with a bang than a whimsy, as Return of the Jedi failed to live up to its series-best predecessor The Empire Strikes Back (it was memorably dismissed as only having “a bunch of muppets” in Kevin Smith’s Clerks). Fast-forward to 2005 and Revenge of the Sith, for all it manifest flaws, proved to be a low highlight of George Lucas’s terrible prequel trilogy – ploddingly executed, yet still somehow preferable to the inanities of The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones. With The Rise of Skywalker, the stakes are raised not only because it attempts to wrap up a story arc spanning three trilogies, but also because it follows what proved to be the most divisive episode in the entire series. After the reinvigorating thrills of The Force Awakens (the best Star Wars film since Empire), some fans howled with frenzied derision at Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, feeling “betrayed” by its somewhat iconoclastic take on the series’ ever-expanding mythology, a complaint Abrams appears to have taken to heart. Stylistically, The Rise of Skywalker returns to the aesthetics of The Force Awakens, juggling rocket-fuelled action sequences – dogfights, desert chases and saber-battles abound – with straight-faced “dark v light” standoffs, retaining the thread of humour that dates back to A New Hope while still taking the unfolding events deadly seriously. While Rian Johnson delighted in wrong-footing viewer expectations (Luke comically ditching a sacred talismanic object in Episode VIII raised laughs, gasps and shrieks of dismay in equal measure), Abrams keeps things closer to home, reviving that strange sense of quasi-mystical cod-reverence that was the hallmark of Lucas’s original productions. We pick up with our heroes still pluckily fighting back against the First Order, unaware of a greater phantom menace lurking in the background. In a world in which a cast list can be a plot-spoiler, and death (both real and fictional) is no impediment to resurrection, suffice to say that all the key characters return, including Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia, thanks to repurposed cut-scene footage from The Force Awakens. As for the narrative, Abrams (who shares screenplay credits with Chris Terrio) returns to the core themes to which he and Lawrence Kasdan had “projected forward” when writing The Force Awakens, largely sidestepping (or just flat-out ignoring) the more intriguing googlies of The Last Jedi. Rey’s identity is once again at the heart of the story (the question “who is she?” reverberates throughout), wrestling with her own potentially destructive powers as she continues her long-distance, combative relationship with Kylo Ren. Both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver rise to the challenge of their roles, with the former increasingly commanding the screen while the latter exhibits vulnerabilities beneath the cracked face mask. Between them, they carry the burden of the film’s emotional core as Abrams invokes the fractured-family revelations of yore that have always been a Star Wars staple. Other cast members are less well-served as they ping-pong around the galaxy, chasing clues and objects that open doors leading to other clues and objects like players in some vast, multi-level video game. For such an essentially simple story, there’s a superfluity of plotty exposition, bogged down by an underlying risk-aversion that promptly undoes any genuinely daring developments. What we’re left with is an entertaining but rather empty greatest hits compilation of familiar riffs, characters and iconic space hardware – a feeling amplified by John Williams’s score, which revisits key themes from the entire series in appropriately heart-swelling, tear-jerking fashion.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 22, 2019"," And those aren’t the only creatures to return in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” a solid finale to an ever-evolving story arc which, 42 years after the first film in 1977, still packs theaters. J. J. Abrams co-wrote, co-produced and directed this one (as well as “The Force Awakens” in 2015). He does a fine job of connecting the dots throughout the from the previous films. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of seeing that “Star Wars” logo appear, nor will I tire of hearing the familiar refrain of the John Williams score, knowing seconds later I’ll see a scroll of explanatory text. The story begins a year after “The Last Jedi.” There is Leia – this is no spoiler, because it’s in the trailers - with the help of unused footage from “The Force Awakens,” smart editing and maybe some CGI, with Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last Jedi. Also on hand is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the leader of the First Order and, as you probably remember, the son of Leia and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Billy Dee Williams returns as Lando Calrissian, who originally owned the Millennium Falcon. He’s a hoot to watch and it’s obvious he had a great time in a role bigger than what I anticipated. This is Rey’s movie, but it’s also an ensemble piece, with Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron), Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, John Boyega as Finn and Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca. This is an actioner, not a character-development tale, which presumes most of the viewers will have at least a passing acquaintance with most of the characters. My, is this a capable ensemble, delivering adventure and dialogue with conviction. I especially love the character of Kylo Ren because he is so tormented. Driver plays this character to perfection. I love that all ages are seeing this saga play out. A generation that watched the “Star Wars” films completely on their phones joins a generation that stood in line for hours just to get inside the theater. I embraced not only the film’s nostalgic take on its own origins and characters, but also the people with whom I have watched these films over the years.",POSITIVE

"Dec 21, 2019"," Edwin Arnaudin: After nine films spanning 42 years, we arrive at the (alleged) end of the episodic Star Wars saga. Is The Rise of Skywalker a fitting finale? Bruce Steele: It's entirely fitting for the arc of this final trilogy. It's entertaining, full of action, and hits the same beats as its two predecessors with regard to scope (always bigger!) and character development (never give up hope). I'm not sure it can be judged as a conclusion to the nine-film series, since each trilogy seems to me to be self-contained in terms of its storytelling approach. Do you see a clearer 42-year cohesion than I do? Edwin: Apparently. Considering the degree to which the repercussions of Anakin Skywalker's narrative remain unresolved this far into the series and how characters from both previous trilogies are still a, uh, force in Episode IX, J.J. Abrams' concluding chapter ties up about every proverbial bow I could imagine. I'm as satisfied with his film as I was with The Return of the King way back in December 2003. Bruce: I'm satisfied, but only as it applies to this trilogy. While I've enjoyed this arc, starting with The Force Awakens, it seems to me more of a spin-off from the original trilogy than a nine-episode climax. It's a completion of itself, with some cameos of characters from the original trilogy, and told within the same universe. But we're splitting hairs, I think. Bottom line, this is a worthy entry into the Star Wars canon. Edwin: Agreed. Following the narrative clunkiness of The Last Jedi, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio keep the plot active, peppering it with thrilling set pieces, plenty of humor, and engaging visuals both old and new. Most importantly, they further enhance this trilogy's key dynamic, that of mysterious Jedi-to-be Rey (Daisy Ridley, who hasn't received proper praise for her work in these films) and Kylo Ren (2019 entertainer of the year Adam Driver). Were you firmly invested in their fates? Bruce: I was happy to see Rey really connect with her abilities and explore her mysterious parentage in this one, and even though the Kylo Ren story didn't go where I expected, it swept me along nicely. Finn (John Boyega) gets to connect with some new allies he can really relate to, and Poe comes into his own as a general, so that was fun to watch as well. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), introduced in The Last Jedi, is essentially sidelined, but I think that's because Abrams and Terrio had a different agenda for Finn. Where else did you see Skywalker sort of burying the mixed-bag legacy of Last Jedi? Edwin: Other critics keep crowing about how the previous installment takes all these amazing risks while Abrams' entries play things safe, and that take perplexes me. I see little evidence to the former — unless you consider poorly-developed story lines to be daring — and only agree with the latter in regard to The Force Awakens following the beats of Star Wars, albeit with fresh players and far more humor. Still, I suppose an argument can be made that the Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) we see here is ""Classic Luke"" instead of the salty, disillusioned loner from Last Jedi. But as with many turns and resolutions in Skywalker, I see his shift as an intelligent depiction of people's ability to change and evolve, colored by late-breaking prophecies and revelations that have been rattling around in the old guard's heads, waiting for the next generation to see them through. Bruce: I'm sure Hamill was happier with his cameo here than his story line in Jedi. The original Star Wars characters get to play crucial roles in Skywalker without being trotted out too often, and the Leia Organa thread worked out despite Carrie Fisher's death three years ago. A couple of those scenes are a bit disconcerting, but they're early on, so it doesn't disrupt the main flow. I was worried a bit that the plot was going to follow an interplanetary trail of bread crumbs — you know, clue, new planet, clue, new planet, etc. — but the story gets more complicated about halfway through and stays intense to the end. Edwin: Those bread crumbs are also pretty conveniently found, but each escapade is fortified by the Rey-Kylo bond and ramps up the intensity and urgency of each subsequent leg of the mission. As a result, I got hit pretty hard on an emotional level at several key junctures. Were you similarly moved by this Grade A experience? Bruce: I was moderately moved but thoroughly entertained. I like Rey and Poe and Finn just fine, but to me they're not as vibrant and iconic as the original trio. These days I typically absorb Lucasfilm and Marvel movies with similar bemused detachment, which is why when a Rogue One or Captain Marvel comes along, or Woody Harrelson in Solo, I'm so enormously pleased to be more emotionally engaged. But that may be more about me than about The Rise of Skywalker. It strains credibility with some regularity, but it's got some good twists and really bracing moments, and it ties a nice — and yes, moving — bow on the trilogy, so I'll give it a B-plus.",POSITIVE

"Dec 21, 2019"," There are so many pleasing plot twists and pop-up appearances in this, the final chapter of one of the one of the most successful franchises of all time, that it’s a very difficult film to review. If I say it has too many this’s or that’s (which it does), it could totally spoil some excellent surprises. So I’m left with giving you my impression of the film as a whole, which is by no means negative, but not overwhelmingly positive either. I’d give it about a 6.5 on a scale of 1-10. In an effort to wrap things up, there is so much frantic racing around that some of the characters and plot points don’t receive the emotional depth and development I would have liked to see, especially from Rey (Daisy Ridley) who is a heroine for the ages. Can that girl ever use the force! She’s the one I’ll miss the most. The one I’ll miss the least is repurposed footage Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. Movie magic was used to incorporate her into the film, and it’s quite distracting. And those over the shoulder/behind the back head shots, a device they’ve been using on TV since the 1960’s, are not worthy of a film of this magnitude. That may be a low point, but there are also many high points. Viewers will especially enjoy the opportunity to get last, fond looks at some of their favorite characters (spoiler alert! Jar Jar Binks is not among them). And while there are some poignant endings, there are also some wonderful beginnings. New characters and new roles for old ones are satisfying without being gratuitous. So while it’s not the best film of the year, or even of the franchise, it’s still definitely a must-see for anyone who even has a vague connection to Star Wars. Thank you writer/director J.J. Abrams, for not messing it up. Hopefully this Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker review will help you remember to buy your tickets in advance.

"Dec 21, 2019",The Rise of Skywalker is a satisfying conclusion for all three trilogies.,POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019"," On May 25, 1977, John Williams’ propulsive score introduced George Lucas’ sci-fi fantasy, featuring Luke (Mark Hamill), Leia (Carrie Fisher), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Darth Vader (James Earl Jones), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), Yoda and the indispensable droids: C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2. While the Star Wars concept continues in various spin-offs, that era has concluded. After George Lucas sold the franchise to Disney in 2012, J.J. Abrams has masterminded the final three ‘origin story’ episodes, introducing desert scavenger-turned-Jedi  Rey (Daisy Ridley) and First Order Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) – a.k.a. Ben Solo – under Sith Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). This installment begins a year after The Last Jedi. And while the First Order has quashed the Resistance, Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) and spice-smuggling ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) have been sent by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher) to search the galaxy for potential allies. Abrams introduces Keri Russell as slinky Zorii Bliss, almost unrecognizable under a large brass-and-red helmet, along with Naomi Ackle as a bow-and-arrow wielding warrior astride an equine called an Orbak. And there’s a glimpse of Fisher’s real-life daughter Billie Lourd as a Resistance lieutenant. Working with co-writer Chris Terrio, Abrams also pays homage to Billy Dee Williams as roguish pirate Lando Calrissian and other nostalgic surprises that I won’t ruin for you.  While the convoluted, vaguely coherent plot’s a little vague, cinematographer Dan Mindel chronicles several dazzling battles and tense, lightsaber clashes. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is a sprawling, satisfying 7, as familiar memories of flying on the Millennium Falcon continue. And – at least at Disneyworld – The Force will always be with you.",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019"," The latest trilogy of Star Wars films and the Skywalker saga comes to a close with J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. It’s the conclusion of a nine film journey, one that has been littered with everything from cinema changing moments to hugely divisive plotting and characterisation. In 2015 Abrams picked-up George Lucas’ discarded lightsaber and delivered the spirited and energetic The Force Awakens (read the review), a film which brought Star Wars to a whole new generation, whilst also keeping old fans happy. Rian Johnson’s 2017 instalment The Last Jedi (read the review) was a disappointing entry which split fans and caused a serious disturbance in The Force. Now Abrams is back with The Rise Of Skywalker, a Star Wars film which should give Star Wars fans everything they could hope for and more. It’s packed with call-backs to the eight films which have gone before, echoing and repeating lines images and moments. It never feels like fan service though – more like a love letter to everything George Lucas created over the decades. To quote Lucas himself, ‘It’s like poetry, it rhymes’. The dead speak! Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is alive and he built a secret super army called The Final Order which is set to destroy Carrie Fisher’s General Leia and The Resistance. For nefarious reasons he also wants Daisy Ridley’s Jedi protege Rey and Kylo Ren onboard as an ally, and it looks like he’s going to get his wish. Meanwhile Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are on their own mission to track down The Emperor’s location in an attempt to thwart his plan for galaxy domination.  J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio have ditched many of The Last Jedi’s more controversial aspects and decided to deliver what Star Wars does best by focusing on lightsaber fights, space battles and rip-roaring adventure. Yes, it’s a little over-stuffed and there’s enough going on to fill two films, but this delivers in a big, big way.  It’s great to see Rey, Finn and Poe finally creating the trifecta of friends which mirrors that of Han, Luke and Leia and the trio share an easy chemistry between the set pieces. However, its Adam Driver who delivers the best work, as the man still trying to decide if he’s really Kylo Ren or Ben Solo. He’s got a lot to work with here on both a dramatic and physical level – this is what Hayden Christensen’s Anakin Skywalker should have been in Lucas’ prequel trilogy.  The new generation of actors are great, but it’s wonderful to see old faces return for one final time. Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker is now a sage Force Ghost delivering advice to Rey much like he received from Obi Wan Kenobi. Billy Dee Williams is back as everyone’s favourite smooth-talking scoundrel Lando Calrissian and seeing him again behind the controls of the Millennium Falcon is the thing of childhood dreams. The Rise Of Skywalker is also Carrie Fisher’s final performance as Leia and it’s a fitting send-off for the actress and her iconic character. The performance may be created from editing room cast-offs, but it never feels that way. There’s a reverence in the way that Abrams has crafted Fisher’s character and performance and it feels organic to the movie and its plot.  On a technical level, The Rise Of Skywalker is a marvel. The special effects and design are next level great, perfectly building on everything which has gone before. It looks and feels like Star Wars at its best and there’s a real tangibility due to some impressive sets and practical effects. Speaking of Star Wars at it’s best, these films wouldn’t be half as good if it wasn’t for John Williams’ music and the 87 year-old has delivered a sumptuous score which includes some old themes and some beautifully new ones.  For over 40 years the cinematic battle between The Jedi and The Sith has rumbled on. George Lucas changed the course of cinematic (and blew the minds of audiences) when he opened the first Star Wars film with a tiny blockade runner being chased by a mammoth, Star Destroyer. The Rise Of Skywalker is the perfect ending to this. There will be those who adore it for how it connects to the larger Star Wars mythos and the movies which have gone before and there will be those who don’t see it as being progressive enough in what it delivers. These film’s have always based on old serials (the episodic nature is even in their titles), so you can’t complain too much when they skip from one adventure to the next in quick succession.  A ridiculously fun and energetic cinematic adventure, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is everything a true fan of George Lucas’ intergalactic saga wants. There’s humour, emotion and some real of depth as characters old and new bring their stories to a close. This isn’t just a great movie. This is Star Wars. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 21, 2019","  J.J. Abrams (“Super 8″/”Star Trek Into Darkness”) helms the final episode in the original nine-film saga, an entertaining escapist film but one in need of a more creative script rather than aiming just for completeness and glorifying the old banalities. It marks the return of the franchise to plodding films like those George Lucas himself pushed on us in the second trilogy that were filled with dull  intrigue, witless dialogue and tiresome heroism. The script was co-written with Abrams and Chris Terrio, who are working from their story with Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow. But if a Star Wars fanboy, the film probably caters to your needs and you’ll probably find it a fun film even if it’s still too busy trying to wrap up things that started four decades ago in 1977.  In the opening scene, we’re told “The Dead Talk!” It seems that bringing dead people or things back to life is the way of the franchise. As if telling us no matter what, there will be no possible end to this franchise as long as people want to see it. So I doubt very much if this is the last Star Wars. We soon become aware that the evil hooded emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, in a hammy performance), who died at the end of “Return of the Jedi,” didn’t die but has been hiding in the not located place of  Exogol all this time in a secret Sith lair, and is responsible for all the trouble that abounds of trying to smash the Resistance and bringing about a reign of terror. The story therefore revolves around Palpatine and the rise of the evil First Order.Besides finding out what Palpatine has been doing since his return, we now must wrestle with what happened to the parents of Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) and how is she connected to patricidal Sith Lord Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Rey continues her Jedi training with the Resistance leader Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, appearing from unused archive footage of Star War films).The scarfaced Kylo Ren, Darth Vader’s revolting grandson, moves around in his tie fighter and is up to no good as he follows the commands of the villainous emperor. Meanwhile Rey, his telepathic lover from the past, has gotten over her affection for him and is busy at work with her rock-levitation practice and fighting for the Resistance. The tensions between these two results in their memorable lightsaber duel. The good guys of the Resistance scurry around for answers when the news gets out that Palpatine plans to start destroying planets in less than a day’s time to bring about his “Final Order.”Stopping Palpatine and his storm troopers onslaught is up to the Resistance fighters like the frisky Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), the bland ex-storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the talkative android C3-PO (Anthony Daniels), who are under the command of Rey. After getting intel from a spy who infiltrated the evil First Order, the urgent situation calls for bringing back help from characters from other episodes who might not have appeared for quite some time, like the cameo of the smack-talking 82-year-old Billy Dee Williams as General Lando Calrissian -he last appeared some 36 years ago. What Rey and her Resistance team need to do is get their hands on a crystal that will show them the way to Exogol and thereby they can take out the despot and stop his Final Order.In an obvious Trump reference, the Resistance movement is warned that it must not let the emperor’s propaganda make the Jedi feel alone in the galaxy and incapable of resistance when in fact they are in the majority. What this Star Wars episode does well is offer some visually spectacular scenes, especially the one of a planet containing a massive fragment of fallen Death Star surrounded by hundred-foot waves. There also are some new characters introduced, such as a masked warrior/hacker played by Keri Russell. It’s public knowledge that Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney in 2012, and that has led to speculation by some critics that the franchise has become too Disneyfied. The derivative Abrams, working for Disney, brings solid craftsmanship but no innovations to the franchise. But he shows an uncanny ability to clean things up and shows an eagerness to please the fan base by revisiting the same old things as a matter of nostalgia and even ending the saga by mysteriously resurrecting the evil emperor fighting the Resistance. I won’t argue if you say this theme has modern-day implications and its mythical story remains timeless, but I maintain it has lost some of the magic of the original Star Wars films. Enough is enough. I could do without anymore sub-par Star Wars films.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019"," “Star Wars” The Rise of Skywalker” wraps up the nine-film
saga of the Skywalker family in an untidy bow that is a bit worn and uneven. Yet, despite its flaws and familiarity, “The Rise of
Skywalker” draws you in, mainly because you are ardently invested in the
characters — old and new. You want to know and care about their fates. Will Daisy Ridley’s Rey find the answers she has sought since “The Force Awakens?” Will Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren fulfill his destiny? Will the First Order be victorious? Or will the Resistance win the day? The film jumps from situation to situation and from character to character at a rate that will make you gasp for air. And that dilutes the poignant gravitas this saga’s conclusion  should have attained. Like most of the other movies in the franchise, “The Rise of
Skywalker” offers serial-like exploits and last-minute, hairbreadth escapes. It
all feels so recognizable and comfortable. The movie offers some pleasant, but not unexpected, surprises. Some, though, feel as if they were catering to fans by repairing plotlines from “The Last Jedi” that some of the faithful derided. It’s no secret that the main antagonist behind-the-scenes of this trilogy is the evil Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), believed killed by Darth Vader in the final reel of “Return of the Jedi.” But, like Ming the Merciless in the “Flash Gordon” serial trilogy, death cannot keep a good villain down. Bringing back Palpatine is another connection to close the loop between this latest trilogy and the original. The cast of characters is so huge that many are given little to do. Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron and John Boyega’s Finn, along with Ridley and Driver, get most of the screen time. The cast also includes an older and heavier Billy Dee
Williams, returning as Lando Calrissian, Lupito Nyong’o reprising her Maz
Kanata, Domhnall Gleeson as Gen. Hux and Richard E. Grant, Keri Russell and
Naomi Ackie. Then there are the droids: Antony Daniels C-3PO has some touching
moments that nearly make him the most human personality in the film, while
R2-D2, BB-8 and D-O add some pleasing droid moments. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is definitely
entertaining. Some fans of the full series may quibble with some aspects. It is
not a perfect movie and may be debated for years to come. Yet the final scenes are fitting and bring the entire
enterprise back to where it began. And, as the suns set on this movie series,
we can embrace the enjoyment, thrills and fun it has given us over the decades,
while being charitable to its faults and missteps.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","I found The Rise of Skywalker's attempts to congeal the disparate elements from the previous eight chapters captivating. No, not every choice succeeds, but a bold attempt is far more satisfying than a lackadaisical effort.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," With “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” audiences come to a sort of ending – for now, at least – of the saga that began over 42 years ago with George Lucas’ original space opera. Much like “Avengers: Endgame,” “The Rise of Skywalker” isn’t an ending to all stories told within the universe or the brand itself, but it does act as a (temporary) bit of punctuation meant to bring these decades of storytelling to a satisfying conclusion. Though “The Force Awakens” found director/co-writer J.J. Abrams capturing a lot the spirit of the original films while creating interesting characters and fun sequences, it unfortunately felt a bit too much like a retread. Abrams returns as director and co-writer (this time with Chris Terrio) for “The Rise of Skywalker,” and it’s a whole new beast with its own set of problems. There are some thoroughly engaging sequences, strong performances, great creature designs and rewarding moments for the “Star Wars” faithful, but there’s also a bunch of exposition, what feels like arbitrary introductions of changes and rules, complete disservice to various characters and an oddly defiant repudiation of a large majority of “The Last Jedi.” In other words, it’s a modern “Star Wars” film – flawed but with winning moments that will surely make internet discourse somehow even more awful. The end of the “The Last Jedi” found the Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), shrunk down to merely dozens of members after losing their latest battle with the insidious First Order. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) ascended to rule over his fascistic army after killing his sinister master, psychically bonding with Rey (Daisy Ridley) over their muddled roles in a centuries-old grudge match and watching his former mentor (Mark Hamill) fade into the afterlife. Poe (Oscar Isaac) learned that he’s part of a group and can’t simply go off on adventures as the cavalier hotshot he wants to be. Finn (John Boyega) found his place in the intergalactic civil war thanks to Rose (Kelly Marie Tran). And Rey uncovered an increased confidence in her powers as she, General Organa and the remaining Resistance members pile on to the Millennium Falcon and figure out how to save their universe without constantly falling into the same historical pattern of events. But none of that really matters now. Well, that’s not entirely true. Kylo is still in charge of the First Order, the jackboot army that remains intent on ruling every inch of the universe with an iron (and oddly British) fist; the Resistance is still the plucky group of ragtag fighters that are a bit greater in numbers than when they were last seen; and Rey is continuing her Jedi training while engaging with Kylo Ren in love/hate psychic banter. The film’s opening crawl fills us in on the rest, as Kylo and his Knights of Ren are storming across the galaxy trying to locate the origin of a broadcast that appears to be from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) himself, who somehow survived getting tossed down a conveniently placed shaft in the second Death Star before it exploded in “Return of the Jedi.” Kylo doesn’t want anyone challenging his claim to leadership and seeks to kill Palpatine, only to learn that the Emperor has somehow built a whole fleet of mega-Star Destroyers capable of wiping out literally everyone and everything in the galaxy. Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and BB-8 learn of this new development and quickly scramble to find the Emperor’s secret lair and shut down the so-called Final Order that the resurrected Sith lord has conjured. From there, the audience is treated to cameos by, and references to, a bunch of previous characters and moments from the other films in addition to a constant sense of movement from one frenetic set piece to the next as secrets are uncovered and various characters undergo changes and meet their fates. So much of this feels like overcompensation from what Abrams must view as the perceived flaws of Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi,” and in multiple incidents, the film acts as a direct refusal of the broadening philosophical and thematic questions that Johnson introduced. “The Last Jedi” had a lot of dialogue-driven scenes where the emphasis was on two people who seemed at odds but also oddly similar doing a sort of tense dance around each other to feel out what was happening. “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t have a lot of discussion scenes, but it does have a lot of flying, fighting, blasters, force blasts, lightsabers, explosions, jumping, running, quipping and John Boyega constantly screaming different characters’ names. To be fair, there are some great action moments and really cool exploration of the power of the Force. Isaac is still a very entertaining rogue whose charm carries many scenes, while Boyega remains a captivating and charismatic presence who is too often relegated to audience-surrogate jokes and vague motivations. Ridley and Driver both handle their roles well, even if there are some lines that are incredibly awkward and the inner lives of these complicated characters gets very muddled without much in the way of emotional logic or reason. Additionally, the creature design is top-notch once again, with Abrams using a lot of practical effects and outstanding CGI to craft a very neat looking universe. The third act possesses impressive fight choreography and aerial staging but also too many fast-paced cuts, an ill-defined sense of stakes and a few moments that are way too similar to two recent films (one involving a historical event and the other involving another branch of Disney properties) that makes what should be a rousing scene come across with a sense of “We’ve seen this already, and better.” Another issue with “The Rise of Skywalker,” which has actually been prevalent in all entries of this new trilogy, is the constant sense of disposable characters. There is an awful handling of previously important figures in order to introduce new, temporary replacements that viewers have no history with and therefore no emotional attachment to. It appears that while a ton of events have happened offscreen between “The Last Jedi” and “The Rise of Skywalker,” no one has talked to each other in that span of time and their relationships have essentially been put on pause. “The Rise of Skywalker” has many oversized moments with massive events and crazy things happening that are constantly meant to be underscored as Epic Game Changers. But without the throughlines of consistent character arcs, there’s no emotional investment in most of these actions. Whatever concern or interest we have in what happens to these characters is based on any lingering nostalgia or the fact that they seem like a pretty cool bunch. “The Rise of Skywalker” isn’t the worst “Star Wars” film, but it may be the most “Star Wars” film. It’s a composite of all the strengths and weaknesses from every entry in the saga, from “A New Hope” to “Revenge of the Sith” to “Solo” and everything in between. For some people, smushing these moments together is a fitting culmination for a 42-year experience. For others, it will reveal a lack of vision that tries and fails to apply a poetic coherence to an epic tale. In the end, a lot of it is what people bring to the theater with them.

"Dec 20, 2019"," This is it. After 42 years, nine ‘episodes’, and billions of dollars in box-office revenue, the so-called Skywalker Saga officially comes to an end. It’s about time, too. Back in 1977, when George Lucas unveiled the first instalment of his ambitious, Hollywood space opera, nobody could have believed that, five decades on, Luke, Han, Leia and the rest of the lads would find a way to reconnect with modern audiences. It was supposed to end with Return of the Jedi. It could easily have bowed out with those horrid prequels. But the sequel trilogy changed everything. A new sequence of stories sprung to life in 2012, following Disney’s lucrative buyout of Lucasfilm – one that playfully assembled the stars of yesteryear, including Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford, alongside a handsome assortment of Hollywood up-and-comers. Initially, these slick and revitalised Star Wars flicks gave us a new hope. They gave us something to get excited about. 2015’s The Force Awakens – a sort of graceful and gracious, greatest hits package, with a few new tracks added on - was a bit of a triumph. 2017’s The Last Jedi – a subversive side-step, that took the saga in directions nobody asked for - stumbled slightly. It was with cautious expectations, then, that we approached the third and final chapter of the trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker (the title of which will only make sense after you’ve seen the darn thing). Could director and co-writer, JJ Abrams – Hollywood’s favourite, cinematic crowd-pleaser, and the man responsible for The Force Awakens - right the wrongs of The Last Jedi? Does Abrams have it in him to tie up every loose end, every dangling sub plot and every last mystery of the world’s most talked-about sci-fi series? Could he achieve the impossible? I’m afraid the answer may not be the one you were hoping for. We need your consent to load this Social Media content. We use a number of different Social Media outlets to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Obviously, we are forbidden from revealing too much, but it’s impossible to provide a synopsis, or indeed, a verdict on these things, without scratching the surface a little. So, you know, there will be minor spoilers ahead. You’ve been warned. Following the events of The Last Jedi, the galaxy has, it seems, received the most startling of messages from beyond the grave. Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), that dastardly Sith Lord, whose lightning-rod fingers caused so much trouble in the original series, is apparently alive and well, and both the Resistance and the First Order are on a mission to find him. Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) gets there first, with the aid of a handy map. Once ensconced in the temple of the sith, our boy, Kylo, is informed of his nemesis Rey’s true nature and lineage. Meanwhile, the Resistance’s key players, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), are taking a little longer on their journey. Led by General Leia Organa (the late, great, Carrie Fisher, who appears courtesy of unused footage from previous films), our heroes round up the rest of their gang and begin following puzzles and clues that will take them closer to Palpatine. This time around, Jedi Rey is stronger with the Force, Finn is beginning to find his feet as a soldier and Poe’s secret past starts to catch up with him. Eventually, Kylo Ren and Rey come face to face, and an epic battle commences as the Resistance sets out to take down the First Order, once and for all. The good news is that The Rise of Skywalker moves, breathes and spins out of control in exactly the way you’d expect from a Star Wars feature. It is, essentially, a bonkers and bewildering exercise in event cinema, and Abrams appears to have hit the ground running in a way that suggests his bosses were keen to eradicate the mistakes of previous instalments. The bad news is that it struggles to find a groove that fits. Clocking in at an arse-numbing 142 minutes, Abrams’s film, which huffs and puffs but never blows us away, spends an awful long time doing very little, delaying key elements and plot points for as long as humanly possible, like a preposterous soap opera that defies its own logic at every turn and is afraid to reveal its twists too early, lest it loses the attention of its audience. The cruel irony is that that’s exactly what happens. There are no real stakes. Things are constantly happening and then unhappening. In The Rise of Skywalker, people fall off cliffs, get blown to smithereens and are blasted in the chest with lightsabers. And still, they find a way to spring back to life and back into the story, unscathed and unscratched. Meanwhile, Boyega has been reduced to a roaring grump, Ridley repeatedly wears the expression of someone who’s just stepped on the business end of a plug, and Driver looks as though he’s wandered onto the wrong set. Honestly, we expected more from their performances. Indeed, there is no real shape to Abrams’s noisy, bloated and pompous presentation. In fact, watching The Rise of Skywalker is something akin to watching someone else play the world’s most expensive, most annoying video game. It’s constantly explaining itself. It struggles to develop a proper, coherent story. There is no real characterisation involved. It kinda sucks, basically. Yes, there are surprises – and quite a few shocking cameos. But the emotional heft of these and other twists and turns, is buried beneath the rubble of a busy, thinly plotted, and poorly executed, theme park of a film. You can almost hear the gears creaking and spluttering, and there is a sense that Abrams and his team are making things up as they go along. The dizzying action sequences are surprisingly weak, too. The baddies – including Domhnall Gleeson’s General Hux and Richard E Grant’s General Pryde - are just cardboard, panto bullies. The ending makes no sense. It is, I’m sorry to say, an outrageously dull watch, a monumental disappointment, and a flimsy finale to the Skywalker Saga.",NEUTRAL

FILM REVIEW – STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. With Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Ian McDiarmid. Written by Chris Terrio & J.J. Abrams. Directed by J.J. Abrams. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action. 141 minutes. There’s a story my mother loves to tell about when I was eight years old, coming home from a breathlessly anticipated outing with the neighborhood kids to see “Return of the Jedi.” Everyone else burst out of the station wagon, running around mimicking lightsaber fights and making pew-pew blaster noises while according to legend I glumly shrugged and said, “It was pretty good, I guess.” Looking back I think the then-final chapter of George Lucas’ beloved space opera was probably the first time I’d ever been disappointed in a movie, a feeling that as a “Star Wars” fan would grow to become something of a constant over the years. J.J. Abrams’ STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is yet another final installment of the Skywalker saga, by my count the third “last Star Wars movie” I’ve gone to see and this one’s not so much disappointing as it is actively, outright terrible. Nothing in this picture makes any sense. It’s got one of those insanely over-convoluted plots where everybody’s running to get a thing they need that tells them where to go to get some other thing they need (in this case, one of those glowing doohickeys apparently on loan from Disney’s Marvel division) and then when they get there somebody explains why what they were doing isn’t working so they have to go get something else– and it just all makes you long for clean lines, cause and effect, characters going from A to B. Like maybe, go rescue the princess from the space fortress and blow it up? Or perhaps, go to a planet full of teddy bears and turn off the deflector shield so you can blow up the replacement space fortress? I really can’t explain what anybody was doing most of the time during “The Rise of Skywalker,” but we learn in the opening crawl that the ugly Emperor who Darth Vader threw down a hole in the Death Star right before it exploded 36 years and seven “Star Wars” movies ago is somehow still alive and well and also secretly responsible for the events of the previous two sequels. He instructs Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren to go kill Daisy Ridley’s fetching Jedi-in-training Rey, but the Emperor doesn’t really want him to kill her and anyway Kylo’s had kind of a crush on Rey ever since she slashed his face with a lightsaber a couple movies ago so this all gets pretty complicated, if not particularly edifying. Meanwhile, what’s left of the Rebel Alliance (or the Resistance, as they’re now called) learns of an even bigger, crazier threat to the fate of the universe than anything they faced in the last two movies, so there’s a lot of running around and forced conviviality between Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe. The screenplay constantly makes a huge deal about what close friends these three have become over the course of all their exciting adventures together even though two of them didn’t meet until the final scene of the previous picture. Competing for screen time are our old pals C-3P0, R2-D2, BB-8 and even Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian is back for this round. There are also several deeply unsettling scenes featuring the late Carrie Fisher, creepily cobbled together with digital trickery and unused footage from the earlier films. (Remember in “Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid” when Carl Reiner edited Steve Martin into scenes from old Humphrey Bogart and Jimmy Cagney movies? It’s something like that, only less convincing.) It grossed me out, to be honest, cutting and pasting lines Fisher delivered out of context and slapping them into scenes written years after her death. It feels to me like a violation of her integrity as an actress, inventing in the editing room a performance she never would have delivered in such a flat, disjointed fashion. (The eyelines don’t even match.) As we’re watching a J.J. Abrams movie, all of this happens in an incredible hurry. The first hour of “The Rise of Skywalker” feels like it’s being played on fast-forward, our characters racing from planet to planet so quickly while randomly running into old friends so often that this galaxy far, far away feels smaller than the suburb I grew up in. Abrams can’t even be bothered with establishing shots, slamming you from one scene to the next in medium close-up medias res. The film boasts some fine production design and never once slows down for long enough to let you look at it. A lightsaber battle on a sea of roaring waves is the lone moment of visual grandeur, and even that’s cut far too quickly to appreciate the choreography. The elephant in the room here is that they accidentally made a real movie last time. Say what you will about Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” – and if you spend any time online you know people haven’t shut up about it for the past two years – the movie took some big swings at challenging a viewer’s preconceptions and the subtext carried with it a sharp level of autocritique with regard to “the sacred Jedi texts,” et al. I think it’s a great work of popular art and one of the few franchise blockbusters worth taking seriously. So of course J.J. Abrams was brought back on board to make sure nothing like that ever happens again. Just as Abrams’ “The Force Awakens” was a beat-for-beat remake of the 1977 “Star Wars” (we refuse to call it “A New Hope” in this household), “The Rise of Skywalker” eventually settles into such a “Return of the Jedi” redux it might as well end with cheap firecrackers and “Yub Nub,” plus the the added insult of walking back or outright erasing pretty much everything fanboys found threatening about Johnson’s film. There’s a palpable petulance with which Abrams brings back that stupid “Spaceballs” helmet Kylo Ren smashed in his first scene of “The Last Jedi,” and the film’s dismissive sidelining of Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico feels particularly egregious given the way racist hordes of young male “fans” chased her off social media. Worst is that Abrams fatally undoes Johnson’s most promising revelation regarding Rey’s parentage, negating his idea that the Force belongs to everyone and not just semi-incestuous members of dynastic bloodlines. Alas we’re back to the monomyth again and old, tiresome prophecies about chosen ones who will bring balance and everyone in this entire universe is fucking related. “The Last Jedi” tried to open up the world a little bit. However you may feel about the casino sequence – and I go back and forth on it—Johnson was at least trying to show us something new instead of just slavishly reenacting your favorite scenes from a movie you loved when you were a little kid. Following “The Last Jedi” by bringing back the Emperor is like when Sylvester Stallone looked at the miracle Ryan Coogler made with “Creed” and said, “Yo, let’s do it again with Dolph Lundgren!” Over the past twenty years, Sean Burns’ reviews, interviews, and essays have appeared in WBUR’s The ARTery, Philadelphia Weekly, The Improper Bostonian, Metro, The Village Voice, Nashville Scene and RogerEbert.com. He stashes them all at Spliced Personality. Why repeat the lie that the “fans” chased Kelly Marie Tran off social media?  Where is the evidence for that she was bullied?  Did you verify your sources? Can you cite anything or anyone who did this?  Re: Last Jedi, my attempting to make the Force available to everyone (which by the way was already somewhat there in the Clone Wars and Empire Strikes Back) but ignore George Lucas’ original trilogy and prequels that the Force run strong in certain families, Rian Johnson undermines the mythology and lore of the Star Wars universe.  The Last Jedi also rehashed many elements from previous Star Wars films like Empire Strikes Back.  The Rise of Skywalker fails on many points which I would agree with you on.  However it seems your expectations and disappointments are that it undid any ‘advancement’ the Last Jedi made to the Star Wars story. Isn’t this what fans felt (though their expectations and disappointments were different – for not understanding, respecting the Star Wars universe, regressing and degrading the character arcs and development of the original characters, blatant plagiarism of ideas from the previous Star Wars, little to no development of new characters, contrived plots, etc.)  There was no fan service in this film. It was desecration.  In the end Anakin is not the chosen one to bring balance to the Force, to destroy the Sith but Rey.  Should not be called Rise of Skywalker but Rise of Palpatine. I have to refute your one part of the review that says Rian Johnson made a ‘real movie’ with the Last Jedi. What he did was cancel all the questions asked in the Force Awakens and left the audience with no reason to go back and see the finale of the new trilogy due to apathy. I understand that fans were expecting monumental twists like the Empire Strikes Back and he subverted that notion. But what he actually did was butcher a Space Opera under the guise of the auteur rather than expand the universe. Wanna learn about Snoke? Nup, let’s give him no payoff and kill him. Rey’s background? Meh, let’s surprise the fans with no history. Romance? Let’s introduce a character nobody knows and make an awkward relationship with her and Finn as they travel to a casino. Luke, the main protagonist of the most beloved trilogy? Kill him via meditation after he whines the whole movie. “Good luck with the third film whoever is taking over from me.” A lot of critics like to state how revolutionary this movie was in the lexicon of the Star Wars franchise. But Johnson did it for the sake of saying he was the first to crush the ‘hero’s journey’ rather than the mindset needed of making an enjoyable Star Wars film that would lead to an anticipated finale and conclusion. Instead JJ Abrams was left to pick up the pieces of the now ‘defunct’ story and create a trilogy in the space of one film. That’s not something to be proud of when you’re adding to the Star Wars canon. Critics need to get off their high horse and stop trying to demand high art from something that started off as a Space serial. It’s melodrama set in a galaxy far, far away. Not an essay on cinematic tropes that need to be disbanded for the sake of showing everyone how much of an ‘artist’ you are. Thank god someone gets it. Thanks Frank. Rian ruined the franchise. It drives me crazy that some of these moronic reviewers believe that “taking chances” always equates to “good art.” No. He made about 8 terrible choices in an effort to impress Kathleen Kennedy and get his own trilogy. And all 8 of them sucked. I’ve been reading Sean’s reviews for a long time, and about 90% of the time, he carries his reviews with the same amount of smugness as his picture. I roll my eyes, and move on typically. But this time, I decided to say something. JJ is notorious for starting movies well and ending them poorly. But he turned chicken sh!+ into chicken salad with this movie. The Last Jedi was a god-awful attempt to subvert expectations by using identity politics and anti-war profiteering sentiments to pander to the “woke” Internet. The fact that JJ gave that movie a huge middle finger and spent an hour undoing things was welcomed. I don’t go to a galaxy far, far away to watch Earth politics. He took the storylines that Rian decided end (all of them), and do what he could. And save the breakneck pacing, and overstuffing of plot, he made the best movie an actual Star Wars fan could have asked for. And before you gave me crap about that statement, I’ll be the first to remind you that I don’t care about the collective masses having to enjoy the movie. These movies are made for their fan bases. James Bond fans shouldn’t be catered to when making a Harry Potter movie and vice versa. Not mention the fact that the female reboot movement has proven that people don’t go see movies just cause they see people they recognize on screen. They go see movies they find interesting, and/or have an inner fandom with. All I can hope is that these awful reviews do exactly what they did for Joker. Drive the masses to the theaters, and find their place on the good side of history. Ah, I wish I didn’t agree with your entire review but sadly I do. Your point about this movie dismissing the really intriguing and novel ideas/developments from The Last Jedi (Rey being her own person not beholden to any lineage, which was of course a perfect contrast for Kylo Ren’s struggle) was one of my deepest frustrations as well. I felt like I was being punished for having enjoyed Ep VIII.  I was too naiive, I guess – I was so excited to see how those ideas from The Last Jedi would be expanded on and brought to conclusion that I had really been looking forward to this movie – I fully wanted and expected to like it. But the choice to be beholden to lore and fanservice rather than doing something interesting with these characters I guess shouldn’t have come as such a surprise.  If they really do let Rian Johnson go ahead and write/direct a new trilogy, I’ll probably go see that, but at this point I don’t have a lot of faith left in the rest of the Star Wars storytelling machine if this is where we end up – a hopeless finale that leaves our main character in the same way she started, alone in the desert. Agreed. Too many fans see lore as unchangeable and “sacred” when it’s just an accumulation of characters and setting interacting over time in the fictional setup. Proper storytelling (if the story moves forward with new installments) should keep it dynamic, like science, not something like the Dead Sea Scrolls or the Mahabharata. And The Last Jedi felt like it punished people for enjoying The Force Awakens. That’s the basic problem with this trilogy: Kathleen Kennedy let two filmmakers with diametrically opposed visions handle the story. It’s ridiculous. I did not grow up watching the Star Wars movies. I’ve watched all of the new films however to me The Last Jedi stood out to me as THE BEST ONE. This Skywalker one seemed more childish and the characters didn’t seem like they were in a land far away..it felt like we were watching them on a studio lot. The acting was good it was just the storyline didn’t blow me away like The Last Jedi did. Anywho just an avid movie watcher and thought some points in your review were spot on. Perfectly agree with a lot of your points. A lot of fans blindly misunderstand the “force is strong with my family” line of Luke from ROTJ as “this is the only way for a force sensitive to come about”, which is sad and funny at the same time, considering George Lucas in the prequels built a whole roster of Jedi without delineating their bloodlines just to underline the mistake of taking Luke’s line literally. In fact, Luke in ROTJ was describing being force sensitive in HIS (and Leia’s) case, not dialogue expositing how force sensitivity for EVERYONE happens. Except a lot of fans who take main character dialogue as factual exposition happened…and that’s where the seeds of TLJ whining sprouted. With TROS I did like the Ben and Rey parts, even though the Rey Palpatine “twist” is pointless since the essence transfer plot device would still work if she wasn’t related to Sheev as long as she was a force vergence (like Anakin). Those parts being noticeably better than the flat recycling that was the rest of the movie owes more to Daisy and Adam’s chemistry more than anything. And yes, TLJ was a real movie. This was a fanservice mess, except for the Rey / Ben parts. “ But the choice to be beholden to lore and fanservice rather than doing something interesting with these characters I guess shouldn’t have come as such a surprise.” I’m sorry, Carolyn, that movies that are made in universes tend to follow the lore of those universes. I, for one, am personally offended that the Enterprise wasn’t captained by a sand worm from Dune while iron man flies around engineering talking to that robot from “flight of the navigator”.  So, basically you enjoy A New Hope–oh wait, you don’t call it that–and Empire Strikes Back. You’re not a Star Wars fan, you just like a couple of the movies from the series. And are parroting every other critic who just looooooved The Last Jedi and now hate Rise of Skywalker for…being having more of a continuity with 7 of the 8 previous films? Don’t misunderstand, I loved TLJ.  It was beautifully shot, and it took a lot of chances, some of which worked better than others. But the fact is, JJ Abrams was given some threadbare scraps to work with, and managed to turn the series finale into an exciting and satisfying conclusion to this saga. Was there similar beats to previous stories? YES!  Lucas himself said that these films were supposed to be operatic, with certain themes and ideas reprising themselves throughout. Your cynical dismissal, also parroting the critical party line of TROS, shows how little you understand these films in the first place. That The Last Jedi “annihilated” a couple of intrinsic details is more forgivable than bringing back Palpatine (ah, who cares). Old mate J.J. must have been either too busy or too starved of creative juices to come up with something better. It wouldn’t have been too hard.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," When the new “Star Wars” trilogy began back in 2015, it started on a somewhat shaky note. J.J. Abrams’ “The Force Awakens” ended up being a decent film, but there’s no denying that it amounted to little more than a beat-for-beat remake of “A New Hope,” leaving many fans disappointed that he hadn’t tried to do something a little more creative. However, all of that changed with Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi.” His film was big, bold, original, and dared to go off in unexpected directions, resulting in the best “Star Wars” film since the original trilogy. Now the time has come for the conclusion of the trilogy, and of the entire Skywalker Saga, with “The Rise of Skywalker,” where we once again see Abrams taking the helm. Will he take a page from Johnson’s book and dare to go big and bold, or will the finale end up being not quite so grand? At the start of the film, it has been rumored that Emperor Palpatine has returned, which causes Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to attempt to seek out and destroy him. However, the Emperor reveals a secret fleet dubbed the “Final Order” and sends Kylo to kill Rey (Daisy Ridley). Meanwhile, the Resistance receives the information regarding the Emperor’s return from a spy, which leads Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and their comrades to the ship of someone who might be able to help find him. There they find an item that could help lead them to him, but with the First Order closing in, they’ll have to put all of their skills to use to overcome the odds and pull off their incredibly dangerous mission. There’s really no beating around the bush with it: J.J. Abrams’ conclusion to the Skywalker Saga is something of a mess. Whereas Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” had been daring, exciting, and encapsulated everything that makes “Star Wars” great, “The Rise of Skywalker” brings the trilogy to an end with a bland, dull, and very forgettable final entry. In fact, the difference between the two films is night and day, and is quickly noticeable from the opening scroll of “Episode IX,” which reads as though it was written in a rush by an inexperienced writer. The problems only expand from there, including multiple silly plot twists (which won’t be given away here), writing that lacks the adventure and spirit of the franchise, and a dull conclusion that doesn’t bring about much excitement. The biggest problem though is that this entire film feels as though it was made to pander to the fans. Apparently the filmmakers thought that easy answers and a familiar villain is exactly what everyone wanted, even if it didn’t make sense, and even going so far as to change certain shocking things from the previous film. “The Last Jedi” worked so well precisely because it didn’t go this easy route, and didn’t go the exact way fans thought it would. Johnson dared to do something different, and in doing so, came up with something incredible, whereas Abrams and co. tried to give fans exactly what they wanted to see in a “Star Wars” movie, therefore giving them a film that has no surprises to offer. The obvious place to point the finger would be at co-writer Chris Terrio, who, while he did win an undeserved Oscar for the decent “Argo,” was responsible for the dreadful films “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice” and “Justice League.” It’s unclear as to why they would choose someone who has already ruined two big-budget superhero films to help pen a “Star Wars” film when he’s clearly not qualified. It certainly doesn’t help either that Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, both responsible for the terrible “Jurassic World” films, were allowed to help write the story. It’s possible that Abrams himself is to blame as well, but given his track record, and those of all of the others involved, it seems clear as to who hurt the project the most. It all really just makes you wish that Johnson had been able to return as writer/director of this last installment, but unfortunately given the last-minute director shakeup (thankfully Trevorrow was fired before he was allowed to helm), he was unable to commit. A conclusion to this saga could have been something truly remarkable in the hands of the right writer, and it’s rather disappointing to wind up with this overstuffed actioner that does little justice for the characters in this epic narrative. After all these characters have been through, there should’ve been something more than this. Unfortunately this is what we are left with: a completely forgettable finale that could have been so much more. 2/4 stars.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019"," After over 40 rollercoaster years, it's a troubling and sad day of reckoning to have to admit that - even for me, a Star Wars Lifer - I can't see past the flaws to love this final chapter in the Skywalker saga.  Or is it that JJ Abrams was asked to make a movie to service the fans' every desire, rather than making the movie he wanted to see himself? The toxic, very vocal underbelly of the Star Wars fandom shrieking like outraged little girls at Rian Johnson and The Last Jedi really did make me giggle. But it's that very shrieking and the fact Lucasfilm listened that I blame for this Rise of Skywalker. Step by step, box tick by box tick, button-push by button-push, Abrams tried so very very diligently to course-correct all the things those noxious Porg-hating neanderthals cried foul over; and what a total bummer that is. With this first viewing under my belt, my expectations are dialled down a little and I've had some time to unpack and begin to process the multitudinous plot reconfigurations and exposition. I suspect this finale will warm my heart a little more on repeat viewings and I know there will be plenty of those. While I know thus far, disappointment seeps from my every sentence, I do promise you there are plenty of good things to bear witness to here. Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are two of them. This talented pair delivers gutsy, driven performances with a gripping, intense storyline to sink your teeth into. While Snoke's throne room light saber fight in The Last Jedi remains my favourite of this final trilogy, there are two excellent saber sessions here which I found very pleasing.  The return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and seeing him behind the wheel of the Falcon again with Chewie at his side was a moment I loved. Meatier screen time for R2 and C-3P0 was also definitely a highlight. There are other nourishing tidbits to savour, but of course to reveal them would spoil the fun, and the last thing I want to do is dial back your fun factor. For that very same reason I won't dive into this incredibly convoluted plot in any detail, but know that key to everything is the heartbeat of this entire franchise; the showdown between the dark and the light sides of the force. Here that means a face-off between the First Order's Supreme Leader Kylo Ren and Rey. The resistance was decimated by the end of The Last Jedi, General Organa (Carrie Fisher) still leads them, against the odds, in their last ditch mission to restore peace to the galaxy.  It's the first half of the film which suffers the most from the breakneck speed of the overstuffed narrative, the many strands unravelling too quickly to fully connect with some big ticket reveals and moments. Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker had a big job. For a goodly portion of the Star Wars fans that job has been done, they will be satisfied.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," As a card-carrying member of the original ""Star Wars"" fan club, I know what it means to give a spoiler-free review of the final chapter in the Skywalker saga. I have to confess that when it comes to reviewing ""Star Wars"" films, I am a fan first and a critic second. I can't help it. I have grown up with George Lucas’ “Star Wars” films and yes, it has been a love-hate relationship.  I was 17 when ""Star Wars"" (that first film will always just be “Star Wars” to me and not “A New Hope”) opened and I waited in line at the Valley Circle Theater in Mission Valley where I think I saw it about a dozen times that summer of 1977. The following year I managed to get tickets to the Academy Awards (my uncle was in the Directors Guild and got me connected) when “Star Wars” was up for Best Picture and was infuriated when “Annie Hall” won.  “Star Wars” (along with the films of Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese) was a major influence in my decision to go into filmmaking and film studies. So with “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” opening in theaters and closing out the saga that Lucas conceived more than four decades ago, I felt there was not just a lot riding on the film but that I, like so many people, also had a lot invested in the franchise. As much as I loved Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” I know that film caused divided opinions among fans. I got kicked out of a Facebook “Star Wars” fan group for daring to challenge the admins with a positive take on the film. It has truly saddened me to see my beloved “Star Wars” be a place where toxic fandom exists. We used to just celebrate our shared love for the films and readily tolerate differences of opinion. You love Ewoks, I don’t. So what? Abrams, who won a cult following with TV’s “Lost” and successfully rebooted “Star Trek” on the big screen, was called upon to revitalize the “Star Wars” franchise after fans felt betrayed by Lucas’ special editions of the original trilogy films and angered by his prequels. Abrams proved to be the right man for the job. In 2015 “The Force Awakens” arrived and although it was not a great film it was the healing film we needed. It restored our faith in that galaxy far, far away. It removed Midi-chlorians, and it reminded us that a ""Star Wars"" film could again be fun.  Abrams now returns to the directing chair for the final chapter of the final trilogy of the Skywalker Saga and he essentially delivers a film exactly like “The Force Awakens.” He provides a lot of fan service — some great and much appreciated and some that just feels calculated — and gives us a film that wraps everything up pretty nicely. You can leave the cinema feeling good about where it all ends. Johnson took risks with “The Last Jedi” and while not all of them paid off, at least it felt like he had a personal take on the Skywalker saga. What I loved about “The Last Jedi” was the return to a sense that anyone could become a hero/heroine. It didn’t matter who your parents were or where you grew up or if you had Midi-chlorians, so long as you were inspired to take action and stand up for what you believed in then you could make a difference, and consequently, you could inspire others. I loved that, and although I had issues with cute Porgs and that extended Canto Bight sequence, I will always hold that film dear to my heart. Abrams, on the other hand, doesn’t really take risks. With both ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Rise of Skywalker"" he jumps in with big action scenes to start and finish, then crams a lot of plot in to answer as many questions as possible and correct any misdirections that have occurred, and then fills in with plenty of callbacks to the original films in terms of cameos that fans will love and returning to locations we know. It's a proven formula. It worked in ""The Force Awakens"" and it works again in ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" which is a highly entertaining film that feels mostly satisfying as a closer in a saga. Yet there is a part of me that just doesn’t feel excited about it in the way I did about “The Empire Strikes Back” or more recently “Rogue One.” I felt happy when I left the theater, but mostly relieved. I felt very strongly and positively about how “The Last Jedi” left us with Rey’s parents not being anyone special and I was worried about how this might be addressed in the final film. I can say that I am mostly happy because the idea about free will and individuality are upheld and that was key for me. But I didn't feel that Abrams brought anything fresh to the saga. Maybe a franchise like this doesn't need innovation but I remember that part of what was great about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was that it felt different from the first film, darker. It was still true to the Saturday morning serial vibe but with a new twist. I will give Abrams credit for some genuine emotion in ""The Rise of Skywalker."" Seeing Carrie Fisher as Leia is big in this film and makes you wonder what role she might have played if she had not died. But for me, the most emotional scenes were the ones with the non-human characters. I will confess to tearing up over scenes with C3PO and Chewy more than with any of the human characters. It was good to feel that my attachment to these characters and their feelings were being acknowledged. Abrams does champion the idea of friendship and camaraderie that was at the core of the original films, and his film inspires us with ideas about resistance and rebellion in the face of evil and tyranny no matter what the odds.  The original films had titles that harkened back to the Saturday morning serials Lucas loved. The titles were simple and clear: “The Empire Strikes Back” and “The Return of the Jedi.” This latest trilogy tries to be clever and deliberately vague in order to prompt fan debate before the films even opens. So “The Last Jedi” stirred questions about who that was referring to and what it meant. And then “The Rise of Skywalker” encouraged people to wonder if Luke would return or would Rey be revealed as a Skywalker or would Leia come into play? But at the end of both of those films the titles prove to be a little disingenuous. The ""Star Wars"" films really succeed or fail on the likability of their casts. The prequels had the wooden Jake Lloyd and Hayden Christensen that left us cold but the latest trilogy had the old guard as well as some fresh faces.  Fisher, our original Princess who became a general, died in 2016 but there was apparently enough shot footage to allow her to play a role in “The Rise of Skywalker” with only minor reliance on CGI. It is no secret that Billy Dee Williams is back as Lando and that is a treat. The younger cast, led by Daisy Ridley’s Rey, Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, John Boyega’s Finn, and Oscar Isaac’s Poe are all engaging and thoroughly likable. Ridley, in particular, has an inspiring determination and dare I say forceful glow. She has been a wonderful addition to the franchise, giving it a true heart and soul.  The production values and effects are top-notch in Episode IX, although Abrams seems more enamored with epic battles than with smaller-scale action. As much as I did not like the prequels, I will commend them for some of the lightsaber duels, especially Darth Maul’s (“The Phantom Menace” wasted such a great villain). I wish Abrams had employed some Asian action fight choreographers to give the lightsaber battles a little more of a wow factor in this film. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a lot to process, not because it is a deep or complex film but because it brings to an end more than four decades of storytelling and of my own life. It makes me reflect back on all the films and what they meant and means to me so taking in this last one feels like I need to savor it for a bit. I watched the press screening with a mix of hope and trepidation. I didn’t want the film to ruin anything or do damage to elements I loved (all I will say is Han shot first and Greedo never said ""Maclunky""). So I look forward to seeing it again on Friday when I can watch in a more relaxed manner, knowing what’s coming and being able to think about it more fully.  If “Star Wars” has been a part of your life like it has been mine then you have to see “The Rise of Skywalker.” The good news is that you will also be happy you did. Of course, despite all the insistence that this is the end, nothing that has the potential to make money is ever really over and done with. Or as Luke reminds us in “The Last Jedi,” no one is ever really dead. If you need more “Star Wars” there is “The Mandalorian” offering a great spaghetti western take on bounty hunters and has given us a character that for lack of a better name is being called Baby Yoda, and there is Galaxy’s Edge at Disneyland where you can stand under a beautiful life-size replica of the Millennium Falcon and pretend you are on another planet for just a few hours. It's a bit sad to say goodbye to the Skywalker Saga that has been a part of my life for 40-some years but thank you, George Lucas, for giving us this galaxy far, far away. Long live ""Star Wars"" and may the Force always be with you. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," [star rating=”4″]  STAR WARS THE RISE OF SKYWALKER review. Directed by JJ Abrams, with Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniel, Naomi Ackie, Dohnall Gleeson and Richard E Grant. Impossible rescues and great derring-do, hokey plot devices and larger than life characters, adventures in outer space and a touch of spirituality wrapped up in a whole lot of irreverence for organised religion -it must be a Star Wars movie! And yes, there’s a Skywalker in it. Rey (Ridley), Poe (Isaac) and Finn (Boyega) have to set off on a crazy planet skipping trek through the galaxy to save the day, fighting off the Knights of Ren and assorted star troopers along the way. It’s not anything they haven’t done before, it’s not anything you don’t have fun watching them do again as the special effects are seamless, the battles are epic and by now you are fully vested in the characters, including even more cute droids. The plot is very simple because there is adventuring to be done and places, familiar and unknown, to visit, but really, who watches a Star Wars film for plot? You come for the excitement and you stay for the feels. These are high adventure films featuring a quest for the hero and lots of space battles. Space opera meet swashbuckling pirates with hard-won expertise winning over deliberate ignorance at every turn. Film number nine, Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker, is director JJ Abrams second foray into the galaxy far, far away. And like he did with The Force Awakens, he riffs off the beats of previous films. After all Star Wars 4 to 6 set the standard for space adventures on the big screen. Composer John Williams also has great fun dipping into musical themes from previous films, ranging from Darth Vader’s ominous signature to Rey’s more recent, more delicate theme. In fact, Williams’ music, both previous themes and the original work on display in Rise of Skywalker is a highlight. Not only does he add that necessary touch of thrilling adventure in the right moments, but the music occasionally adds poignant depth to remind you that Georges Lucas’ original impetus for making films was always to elicit an emotional response. The middle trilogy was much more black and white binary in terms of its morality – that was a fight between the plucky underdogs as the good guys and the fascist galactic empire as the bad guys. The beginning trilogy was more murky on the morality, as it told the ultimate bad guy Darth Vader’s origin story – could you really blame him for turning to the dark side when the Jedi were quite the hardcore conservative bunch when compared to the more freewheeling, almost libertarian Sith? And then enter the last trilogy of this decade which really outraged anyone who didn’t like the idea of a strong female character and all those people of character who actually speak. Guess what, we’ve always been there in the Star Wars movies, lurking in the background and these movies have always been about the importance of hope and people from all sorts of backgrounds working together for the common good. It all just happens to be couched in the visual vocabulary of very realistic looking space battles which need a big screen to be appreciated.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," Other critics can talk about how the movie looks awful – the reliance on CGI and seizure-inducing light effects doesn't make up for its feeling of flatness. Others can tell you how the camera swooshing around constantly is supposed to provide big emotions. Others can tell you that the death of Carrie Fisher apparently killed all the ideas the film apparently had for its climatic 40-year resolution of this fight between good and evil, but that did not stop them using her likeness (body doubles, CGI superimposed on footage with poor Daisy Ridley, and yes, full CGI again) to make it appear she was part of this. And if that was the only way the dead spoke, it would almost – almost – have been bearable. But no. The narrative arc of the movie is Rey learning she is not a throwaway child, sold for spite by alcoholic parents. Oh no. Her parents sold her into a life of abuse to save her, because of who her grandfather is. All her skills as a Jedi, all her charm and fighting spirit and kindness, they are nothing compared to her genetic history. A revivified corpse kept alive through machines can condescend to speak to her about destiny and her future, and the movie agrees. Her genetic history and who her family is has ever been the only thing about her that mattered. Who she is for herself doesn't. So the stormtroopers who refused to kill unarmed civilians are arm candy. The engineers who instinctively know how to do the right thing are part of the crowd. Women with big dreams and unstoppable sexual charisma despite being dressed like a knock-off Power Ranger must sacrifice themselves for former boyfriends (thank heavens for plot holes). And we are meant to believe all of their struggle is secondary to that of an empathetic, genius fighter with the worst grandfather of all time. Six years ago J. J. Abrams directed “Star Trek Into Darkness,” and for this site I wrote one of the very few reviews of it that called out its fascism. Mr. Abrams must not read my work, because he has gone and done it again. He has made a blockbuster about how the most important thing in the galaxy is who your parents are. He has twisted a beloved series of movies about how anybody has the power to defeat evil to preach a sermon enshrining the divine right of kings. It is beneath contempt. The only glimmer of hope in the movie is this: The movie makes it explicit that the corporate juggernauts must rely on the dead for their power. But we all know the dead who speak are only flickers of our memories and imaginations. They are not really there. If dancing corpses and special-effect vampirism are the best the powers that be can offer, audiences will turn away for something alive, relevant to the current moment, and, most of all, human. No wonder Disney is so keen to peddle this trash on all frequencies. They're desperate, because they know we're not buying it.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," There is one admirable thing about Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker: It tells you exactly what kind of movie it's going to be right from the jump. The J.J. Abrams-led conclusion to Disney's modern Star Wars trilogy and the grand finale to the so-called ""Skywalker Saga"" arrives in theaters this weekend burdened with the creative challenge of following up The Last Jedi and the impossible expectations that come with ending a Star Wars trilogy. In The Rise of Skywalker's first five minutes, the film lets you know how it intends to go about both of those things: with cowardice. The film begins with an opening crawl that teases Emperor Palpatine might be alive, and within minutes—I swear, minutes; don't let anyone tell you what happens in the first few moments of a film are a spoiler—that tease is confirmed: Palpatine is back. He has an army of Star Destroyers he's ready to give Kylo Ren, if he does something for him first—kill Rey. From this astonishingly brazen bit of fan-pandering, the film rushes onward and never really stops. We briefly catch up with Rey, Poe, Finn and Co. before they're sent on an astonishing number of errands that they must run before the big finale. (Depending on how strict your definition is, there are somewhere between three and five Macguffins the gang spends their time chasing around.) In between checking off boxes on this very cluttered shopping list, The Rise of Skywalker has a few other priorities, like explaining Palpatine's whole deal and revisiting the question of Rey's lineage (another thing the movie tells you it's going to do in those first five minutes). The result is a stuffed film that, because its characters have so little time to sit around and be characters, feels paradoxically uneventful. As a farewell—for now, at least—to the new faces introduced in The Force Awakens, The Rise of Skywalker is perplexingly inadequate. While Rey, Finn, and Poe were never the most complex characters, the Rise of Skywalker mostly has them spouting interchangeable banter with little interest in giving them distinct moments of growth, Rey's journey notwithstanding. Rose Tico, the quiet heart of The Last Jedi, is completely sidelined here, and new characters barely register, showing up to point the main cast in the right direction and then exiting stage left. (There's one extremely good exception named Babu Frik. You can't miss 'em.) Even Adam Driver's considerable talents are barely enough to sell some of what Kylo's up to in this film. It's disappointing, but not unexpected, to watch The Rise of Skywalker and not encounter a single new idea. Those interested in the quiet radicalism of The Last Jedi, which democratized the Force and suggested a moral order more complicated than the Light/Dark binary, will find those notions abandoned, and nothing of substance in their place. What makes The Rise of Skywalker so strange is how it, as the third movie in a new trilogy, is nonetheless even more entrenched in the iconography of the original trilogy. There's no need to divulge any more about the ways the film does this; Palpatine's presence is enough to make the point. This isn't a movie about a new generation facing new threats. It's about new kids fighting their parents' fight, because that's what the fans want to see them do. In other words, It's a movie about how we can't escape those old movies. To this day, Star Wars remains a marvel of emotional manipulation. It's a series of movies meant to enrapture children with an incredibly well-defined look and sound, hardwiring their brains to do cartwheels whenever they hear a John Williams score and the thrum of a lightsaber. Star Wars has raised a generation of easy marks, and I count myself among them. I go into these movies begging to be worked; I want to hear the music swell and see the heroes rise up against the impossible and feel the lump rise in my throat with them. There are no easier buttons to push than Star Wars buttons. Yet The Rise of Skywalker can't seem to do it. It whiffs on its biggest emotional moments. Even its well-intentioned ideas, like bringing back General Leia via unused footage from The Force Awakens, ends up hamstringing the movie's potential for catharsis, because every decision feels like a franchise choice, not a human one. The challenge of watching Star Wars as an adult in the 2010s has been squaring an appreciation for Star Wars, the genuine pop cultural phenomenon, with Star Wars, the aesthetically-pleasing vanguard of corporate domination. Across this new trilogy, we've pointed to flashes of heart in the hopes that it meant that art could exist here, that Star Wars could expand to include all manner of people and stories while also raking in billions at the box office. For a while, it seemed like there could be. The Rise of Skywalker suggests otherwise: giving lip-service to fans while also dictating to them which direction that fandom should flow, constricting instead of widening, safeguarding Star Wars for yet another decade but failing to imagine what the next one would look like.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," Taking on the finale of a trilogy of trilogies is not an easy task, and my heart goes out to whoever is brave enough to try. Here, J.J. Abrams is the one to step up to bat and complete the beloved Skywalker Saga. Uniting critics and fans in the fantastic Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which began this sequel trilogy, Abrams now attempts to end it, and clumsily tie up loose ends along the way. One year on from the events of Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, the Resistance has grown but are still hugely outnumbered. Our lovable rebels, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) have become great leaders, whilst Rey (Daisy Ridley) trains under Leia’s (the late Carrie Fisher sensitively brought back with unused footage) careful guidance. The first act offers some heartfelt character moments and laughs between friends, there is hope in the air amongst the Resistance – a hope that is quickly put to bed when a spy within the First Order delivers a terrifying message. Meanwhile, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) tightens his grip on the First Order, and urged on by a new mentor, continues his obsessive search for Rey in a bid to wipe out the Jedi for good. The relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is further explored in Rise of Skywalker, their deepening connection becoming more prevalent through Driver and Ridley’s all-or-nothing performances. However, their relationship takes centre stage whilst almost every other character goes under-written and under-served. The kindhearted Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) has all but five minutes of screen-time, and new additions in the form of General Pride (Richard E. Grant), Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) might as well not be here. To include so many new faces in a finale seems ambitious, and it certainly didn’t work, but I suppose, what is the point in going into this without ambition? Abrams invites us to countless new worlds in Rise of Skywalker, the colourful festival of desert planet Pasaana is a true highlight, and Kijimi feels real and lived in. It was never a doubt in anyone’s mind that the film would be beautiful. Star Wars never fails to wow audiences visually, with colour abound and spectacular characters and VFX design (shout-out to Babu Frik, the real MVP). But, unfortunately, it’s not enough to distract fans from the glaring flaws in the storytelling and mythos. Rise of Skywalker is almost too much. It’s too many characters, too much pandering and all too fast. The first forty minutes, if a bit calmer, could be an entire film on its own. The film throws a million plots at the audience and simply hopes something sticks. It feels almost over-written, everything comes a little too quickly and a little too easily. For all its MacGuffin’s though, I will admit that the return of the Sith is particularly exciting. The Lazarus-type procedure feels like a common thread tying the story of Rey and the Resistance to distant memories of the Clone Wars.  There is a lot wrong with this film – such as the heinous side-lining of Rose Tico and a pace so fast you might get whiplash – but its spirit outweighs it all. Unsurprisingly, it is clear everyone who made this film loves Star Wars, and while the plot may be inconsistent and thematically unparalleled to The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker stands on its own as a thrilling eruption of jam-packed action and discovery.  Star Wars is about making your own path and finding your family, and Abrams stays true to that in some beautiful ways. The Resistance thrives in the face of adversity, and it always will, even if in a so-so film. In spite of all it’s flaws, I loved watching Rise of Skywalker. I love the universe of this ongoing story so any film is a chance to go there again, and for that I am thankful. While this final installment falls short in comparison to its predecessors, it was never going to be perfect, but I’m happy I got to see light win one last time in the Skywalker Saga.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019"," Picking up where we left off at the end of “The Last Jedi”, Luke Skywalker is gone. Han Solo has been gone since “The Force Awakens” when felled by the light saber of his son Ben aka Kylo Ren. The only hero still standing from George Lucas’ “Star Wars” original trilogy is our beloved Princess, General Leia Organa, who is rallying the Resistance aided by Poe Dameron, Finn, Rey, and Chewbacca, along with a few assorted droids whom we have come to know and love. Poe and Finn are off fighting galactic battles while Rey is honing her Jedi skills under Leia’s watchful eye (in very much the same way we saw Luke do under the tutelage of Yoda). But Rey seeks something that disrupts her own Force. She still seeks to know who she is. Having killed Snoke, Kylo Ren is now Supreme Leader of the First Order. Or is he? Ren learns that there is indeed a greater force, a force once thought gone but is still alive – Palpatine. Having battled and succumbed to the strength of the power of the Dark Side so much so as to kill his own father in order to become Supreme Leader, Ren intends to hold onto his power and will do anything to eliminate any threats to that power, including facing Palpatine. But Palpatine, in hiding on Exogol, has other plans for Kylo Ren and the galaxy. Helmed by J.J. Abrams and written by Abrams and Chris Terrio, Abrams reins in this story, stepping back from the idealogic expansion Rian Johnson introduced with “The Last Jedi”, bringing it more in line with the cinematic mythos of what we all know and love most about “Star Wars” for the past 42 years. And it’s in capturing those elements that Abrams wraps up the trilogy of trilogies, taking us back in time on a ride filled with touchstones to the past, taking us on a travelogue of the galaxy revisiting old haunts and paying homage with little nods reminding us of where it all began and how far it has come. But at the core and heart of THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is the friendship, the camaraderie, the determination and sticktuitiveness, the hope and the belief in that hope that is resonant in any galaxy, at any time. And the bulk of that heart and emotional gravitas falls on the shoulders of Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. Their energy, the internal conflicts of Rey and Kylo Ren, their emotional and moral ambivalence, is what courses through the film’s cinematic veins as each searches to find their true self. Actions and reactions stem from their own quests. The internalized emotion Ridley and Driver each brings to the forefront is riveting, heartfelt, powerful, driving the film forward. This is the best performance of Ridley’s career and Driver isn’t too far behind. Adding to that mix is John Boyega’s Finn. Boyega gives Finn an earnestness and sense of purpose and belonging through choice and free will that is a stronghold in the emotional structure of the film. Free will and choice are powerful emotional elements within this story and carry the film deep into the third act. Oscar Isaac easily slips back into his Han Solo-like performance as Poe Dameron. Flippant at times, but always loyal to his friends, to Leia, and to the Resistance, Isaac adds lighter notes to the darker and more somber tones of what’s at stake in these final hours. Joyfully, after three films together, the triumvirate of Ridley, Boyega, and Isaac have truly captured the magic that was Fisher, Hamill, and Ford, not only with the whip-smart dialogue delivery but in their presence and cohesiveness with their individual strengths powerfully combining as “one”. I don’t know where Abrams was going with the story before Carrie Fisher’s passing, but resurrecting unused footage from “The Force Awakens” and inserting it appropriately within this story construct is beautifully done with a fitting ending for Fisher and Leia. Joonas Suotamo is back as the lovable “walking carpet” Chewbacca and delivers one of the most emotional moments in the film. Kelly Marie Tran, although noticeably underused as uber-mechanical engineer Rose Tico, is also back with earnestness and energy. Don’t miss another wonderful voicing of Maz Kenata by Lupita Nyong’o (although I miss seeing Maz peering out of her magnifying goggles). Dominic Monaghan proves to be a sarcastic scene-stealer as Beaumont. Billie Lourd is also on hand as Lieutenant Connix making for some beautiful and poignant scenes with her mother, Carrie Fisher, as Leia. And what can one even say about Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker at this point but that it’s fitting and proper to see Luke in this final film. Not to be missed is Richard E. Grant as First Order General Pryde and with fun moments, Domhnall Gleason evokes some real laughs as First Order General Hux. Returning for the first time since “Return of the Jedi” is Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as General Lando Calrissian and as comes as no surprise to anyone, it is a thrill to see this caped-crusader piloting the Millenium Falcon and evoking one-liners reminiscent of his old friend Han. (“I’ve got a bad feeling about this!”) Ian McDiarmid also resurrects as Emperor Palpatine and doesn’t miss a beat of evil intonation. Special attention must be paid to Anthony Daniels, the only actor to appear in all nine “Star Wars” films as the beloved C-3PO. And in a somewhat surprising move, 3PO has a wonderful character arc! Joining the Resistance is Keri Russell as the masked Zorii Bliss who at some point seems to have had a somethin’-somethin’ with Poe Dameron making for some entertaining lighter moments. Standout is newcomer to the franchise, Naomi Ackie as Janna. Ackie proves to be a dynamic presence and an interesting character who, like Russell’s Zorii Bliss, begs for more screen time and backstory. The visuals are jaw-dropping, most notably the battle between Rey and Kylo Ren at the destroyed Death Star, and then again in Exogol in the lair of Palpatine (who has been using the same technology to keep himself alive that he used to save Darth Vader at the end of “Revenge of the Sith”). Not only are the fight-sequences white-knucklers in and of themselves, but the lighting and lensing with a celebration of negative space with black on black on black ratchets up the emotional intensity, capitalizing on fear and adrenalin. Cinematographer Dan Mindel, best known for his work on the “Star Trek” franchise as well as “The Force Awakens”, all with Abrams, delivers beauteous imagery, playing with light and color in capturing each of the different worlds visited while creating an intimacy among the characters that buttresses the strong emotional performances of the principals. No stranger to the galaxy is editor Maryann Brandon who cut “The Force Awakens” and returns for THE RISE OF SKYWALKER aided by editing newcomer Stefan Grube. Editing is as rapier as a double-edged Sith light saber, particularly in the battle sequences, but never gives the quiet moments a short shrift and allows them to linger and fill the heart. Not only is THE RISE OF SKYWALKER the end of the trilogy of trilogies and the Skywalker Saga, but the final “Star Wars” film for composer John Williams. But for George Lucas himself, no one has done more to shape this galaxy than Williams and his scoring. And with this final film, he too, goes out with a flourish of emotion with some of the most symphonic beauty to ever grace the silver screen. A perfect coda to the Maestro. STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is safe, and in many instances predictable, but more than anything, is beyond satisfying and beautifully concludes the Skywalker Saga. This is a cinematic experience to just sit back and enjoy. Questions are answered, loose ends tied up. There is love and loss, victory and defeat. And there is always hope. For 42 years, we have been constantly reminded that there is always hope. And surprises, BIG surprises!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," In the run-up to the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the end of the Skywalker Saga, we took a look back at all of the Saga films and re-evaluated them and their legacy as a whole.  We come to it at last: the final Star Wars saga film (maybe?). After forty-plus years of inspiration, innovation, experimentation, and exasperation, the note the series will reach some sort of milestone on is one of… convention. First of all, let’s be clear, this is not the end of Star Wars or even the episodic saga. The commercial reality of the series as it exists now means at the first sign of weakness in other aspects of the franchise, the Skywalker Saga will be returned to in a search for stability and fan acceptance as the choices in The Rise of Skywalker make abundantly clear. The Last Jedi left the current run of the films at something of a crossroads. Though still hopelessly chained to the elements of the original films, it had severed the most ardent connections and pointed to a way forward to the type of challenging filmmaking the series used to be known for. But would that challenge be taken up? After much behind-the-scenes consternation, the baton was passed back to The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams and, with it, that film’s philosophy on the series. Whereas the early episodes of the saga were a catch-all of different influences stewed together referencing many different aesthetics and story types, The Force Awakens only seems able to reference Star Wars. It is the definition of derivative that makes The Rise of Skywalker a copy of a copy: faint, transparent, and hazy on the details. This is the unavoidable side-effect of passing a work from creator to fan because the fan will ultimately never be a fan of part of the whole. The original creation (particularly as discussed around A New Hope) was a culmination of many, many different elements. Some of them will appeal to one group, some to another, none in whole to everyone beyond the original creator.  As the work is passed around, different artisans (which is what Star Wars has now, as opposed to creators) will focus on the different elements that appeal to them and leave others hanging. As this goes on, the form will be mutated and mutated like some strange game of telephone. The result must be ungainly and unfinished because it is missing essential building blocks the artisans didn’t realize were essential. This is inevitable, even if those fans know how to professionally execute a big-budget motion picture (and they really, really do). The craft behind it is exquisite, from the well-lit scenes to the state-of-the-art visual effects and breezy set pieces, but there is nothing that particularly belongs to the film as its own. The color scheme, just as with The Force Awakens, is a hodge podge of repetition without recognition. Nothing too unreal is attempted with the environments providing another assortment of desert, snow, forest, spaceship mise-en-scène, which means the color scheme is once again a mixture of earth colors for the Resistance and blacks and whites for the First Order.  Not because it is attempting to highlight the conflict between the technological society and the way it enforces its will over the natural world as a comparison between the conflict between the protagonists and antagonists, but because that’s the color scheme the old Star Wars movies used. The only thing that the old Star Wars did (though nowhere to the degree of the prequels) that Skywalker resolutely refuses is the stylized dialogue or really anything that would suggest this is another time and place. Everything that might seem archaic or out-of-place is stripped away to make room for modern equivalents indistinguishable from any other studio tent pole. The documentarian feel of the early films, where everything just happened as if it were real, is replaced with slow motion and ponderous score, and anything else Abrams can think of to put his thumb on the scale and make audiences feel what he wants them to feel. And that’s really the animating concept behind Skywalker in particular and the sequel trilogy (and studio tent poles) in general. Call it insight or call it cynicism, but the filmmakers behind all of these realize if they can generate the right emotional responses at the right times nothing else matters. Star Wars was historically such an outlier because it suggested other elements did matter, or at the very least more than the status quo should always be attempted. Instead, The Rise of Skywalker tries to focus just on emotional equilibrium and uses a ‘look at that over there!’ strategy whenever the seams start to show. This can work in the short-term and the best elements of the sequel trilogy — Rey and Kylo Ren — are impossible to cover up.  The idea of the connected two who fight each other in something like a romantic pairing is different from what has been done before — syncretizing the major Skywalker relationships in the prequel and original trilogy into a new form — and the series always comes alive when they become the focus in a way that is not true for anyone else. Poor John Boyega, who had potentially the most interesting character arc as a renegade Stormtrooper – he is never allowed to capitalize on it as no one seems to have known what to do with him (or anything else) after his introduction. All of that stated, the reality is there is just not much that can be said about The Rise of Skywalker because there’s no idea animating it beyond “please don’t hate me.” It is the cinematic equivalent of the new droid character D-0, timidly rolling backward and forward in reaction to the cues of its audience. Though its thematic core seems to be “the role of the Jedi is to confront fear,” it is a philosophy the film refuses to adopt. From the moment old spaceships and old worlds and old plots reared their collective heads in The Force Awakens, this was inevitable. Some of that is done away with throughout the sequel series as it had to be, but nothing truly foundational, and it’s hard to imagine that will ever be the case as this is no longer the milieu of an auteur, and it shows. That doesn’t mean the watchword of the series should be WWLD beyond the general notion of avoiding repetition. The old requirement to grow and change does mean the aesthetic and foundational choices of the saga should be challenged and changed, but changing them into something reminiscent of everything around them isn’t really change. None of this should be surprising, not the least, as it is the destination so heavily pointed to by the inward-looking nature of The Force Awakens. It’s a franchise equilibrium that the James Bond series — long Star Wars’ closest comparison as a cultural force — has managed for an even longer period of time. It suggests Star Wars in its current form can and will probably go on and on and on, for better and for worse.

"Dec 20, 2019"," There’s an almost funereal air of finality to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker that turns out to be entirely spurious. This is, it’s true, the last part of a nine-film saga that began way back in 1977, the final instalment in an epic space adventure that started out with Luke and Darth and has since spun off in 20 directions. But - the clue is in the title - it’s only curtains for the extended Skywalker clan: the Star Wars brand will plough on ad infinitum, with TV shows and new films already in the works. The Rise of Skywalker ends the sequel trilogy that J.J. Abrams began with some aplomb in 2015 with The Force Awakens, a barnstorming revival that played to the franchise’s strengths and pulled at its audience’s heartstrings by reintroducing Han Solo, Chewy and Leia. It was followed by The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson’s colourful but rather labyrinthine 2017 film that thickened unnecessarily an already gloopy plot. Abrams returns for Skywalker, which ought to be good news but mainly isn’t. At the end of the last film, Luke Skywalker died peacefully on Skellig Michael, I mean Ahch-To, after helping the Resistance escape a trap set by the fascistic First Order. With him dead, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is now the last Jedi, and the rebels’ talisman, but in her way stands the powerful Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), son of Han and Leia, whose obsession with the dark side now controls him. The First Order are intent on destroying key planets to end all resistance, and things get worse when the rebels discover that the dreadful Emperor Palpatine has risen from the dead as it were, and now controls operations (no spoilers here - Ian McDiarmid’s name is in the credits). He is searching for Rey, whom he sees as the last person capable of thwarting him, and as the Alliance tries to protect her, all roads lead to an epic space battle. While The Last Jedi got bogged down at times in dynastical minutiae, Abrams goes full tilt for action here, in fact this film barely pauses for breath as it races through lightsaber duels, space chases and interstellar artillery battles. Quiet moments are few, and maybe that’s no bad thing, but Rise of Skywalker feels at times like a Star Wars greatest hits video: there’s a giant devil ship that has to be sunk, a villian with sinus problems (Kylo dons a natty but muffling helmet at one point), a cackling wraith, a desert planet, a snowy planet, drone dog fights, saber-rattling, odds and sods of waddling aliens. Nothing feels remotely new here, and no space is given to the actors. At one point, Princess Leia tells Rey, “nothing is impossible”. She’s not kidding: the actress playing her has been dead for three years, and Leia’s interactions were cobbled together using clever effects and outtakes from the Force Awakens. I’m not sure how I feel about that ethically, though perhaps Carrie Fisher would have been ok with it, but there is, perhaps inevitably, a disconcerting glassiness to her posthumous performance. At least she has a good excuse. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver bring grace and commitment to the two central roles, and there are one or two surprising cameos I won’t give away. But action has been prioritised at the expense of drama here, and Rise of Skywalker feels like it was made to a boilerplated formula. You can watch it, and there are fine moments, particularly a duel on a planet of raging seas, but there’s something lacking here, something a little flat. George Lucas’ 1977 original A New Hope was hokey and badly written but had a kind of seat-of-the-pants magic about it. It also had soul, something this film utterly lacks.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019"," I saw Star Wars in 1977 at the Loews State Theater in Manhattan, now long-gone. Little did I know that the universe George Lucas created would still be alive and well decades later. Diehard fans have a singular attachment to this series, and right after the new installment’s premiere I overheard debates arguing the pros and cons of what we’d just seen. I can only speak for myself. I had a good time watching J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, even though I felt sucker-punched more than once. The filmmaker knows that this is the last time he (or possibly anyone) will get to play with George Lucas’s original concept and characters and his giddiness gets the better of him. Without spoiling any surprises, let’s just say that elements of identity, the powers of the Force and matters of life and death are toyed with in the name of “gotcha” entertainment. At the same time, Abrams knows that diehard fans share his sentimental longing to spend a little more time with the people who first won our hearts in the initial installments of the Star Wars saga. He milks this for all it’s worth, and if he errs on the side of excess I bet there are lots of folks who won’t mind. He also digs deep with Daisy Ridley as the intrepid Rey. You can’t go wrong focusing on intense close-ups of her face as he does. She personifies courage and determination without sacrificing her innate likability. When she battles Adam Driver as Kylo Ren the impact is tremendous. Oscar Isaac has the unenviable job of channeling Han Solo in all his cockiness, but he’s such a talented actor he pulls off the gee-whiz dialogue assigned to him…and John Boyega makes a perfect partner. The action and visual effects are of the highest order but the film doesn’t know when to quit. Abrams shares screenwriting credit with Chris Terrio, based on a story they devised with Derek Connolly and Colin Treverrow and apparently they couldn’t resist adding climax upon climax in the final act. Still, there is so much to enjoy in The Rise of Skywalker that I don’t want to seem like an ingrate. It’s hard to resist the appeal of Billy Dee Williams, returning as Lando Calrissian, or pretend that it isn’t fun spending time with Chewbacca, R2-D2, C-3PO, BB-8 and his new companion D-O. I didn’t approach this film with a checklist of do’s and don’ts. I just wanted to enjoy myself, and I did, albeit with reservations. I think the assets far outweigh the liabilities and fully expect The Rise of the Skywalker to be a giant crowd-pleaser. Whether or not it will meet the demands of long-term Star Wars fans as well as relative newcomers remains to be seen.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","The film is not without thrills and is definitely an amusing jaunt for the most part once you don't think too hard about who, what or why.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her force training, now under the tutelage of Leia (a disturbingly reanimated Carrie Fisher). Meanwhile, we are told that Supreme Leader Kylo Ren is consumed with a quest to find the ultimate evil in the galaxy. Forty years and nine episodes in the making, can J.J. Abrams’ capper to this trilogy of trilogies finally deliver on the promise of the greatest saga in cinema? No. The answer, crushingly and definitively, is no – not even close. The critical response to The Rise of Skywalker has thus far been Luke-warm, garnering the lowest aggregate scores for a Star Wars film since the dreaded days of the prequels. But even these so-so responses do not go far enough, frankly. Abrams’ last entry, The Force Awakens, was criticised for hewing too closely to the original trilogy, yet it was balanced with a vitality and freshness not seen in the franchise since, well, the original trilogy. On the other hand, The Rise of Skywalker’s total lack of creative vision and bravery is simply breathtaking – falling victim to the worst excesses of Abrams’ notorious and vapid ‘mystery-box’ story structure while pandering to the vilest and stupidest demands of the franchise’s Sith-like fanboy hordes. Story spoilers may be sacrosanct in film criticism, but given that Abrams has singularly failed to furnish his film with a story, The Rise of Skywalker does not deserve the sanctuary of spoiler-free discussion as cover for its multitudinous sins. Sitting at the top of the sorry pile is screenwriters Chris Terrio and Abrams’ decision to reverse, ignore and generally piss all over everything that made The Last Jedi so beautiful. Gone is Luke’s ambivalence, replaced by a grinning force-ghost mouthing platitudes. Gone is any semblance of conflict in Kylo Ren – he’s evil for a bit, then turns good after a brief chat with the ghost of Han (his cameo itself a crushing reminder of how good these films used to be). And yes, gone too is The Last Jedi’s rug-pulling revelation that Rey’s parents were nobodies, replaced instead by a plot twist so indescribably stupid, so emotionally and aesthetically ugly, that it could easily have been lifted from the comment section of an incel’s YouTube video. It’s not even right to call it fan service – that would imply some sense of joy or base satisfaction. The less said about Fisher’s pointlessly monstrous resurrection (using repurposed footage from her previous performances), the better. The chemistry between the principal cast has all but evaporated, sucked down by the vacuum of plot twists and execrable exposition, written presumably with an eye on appeasing the pseudo-critics who whinge when not every detail is laid bare in front of them. The return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), meanwhile, is a joke, any menace that he once had gone in a nonsensical fugue of clones and Sith spirits. His inevitable demise is as visually spectacular as it is emotionally hollow. It is shocking, truly shocking, how abjectly The Rise of Skywalker fails. Even the prequels, as shoddy as they were, at least offered something approaching a creative vision. The Rise of Skywalker offers us nothing but toadying supplication to the worst aspects of fan culture. There is no story to tell here, no characters to care about, no ideas to explore. The film is pure construct, a box built for its own sake, at long last opened with excruciating listlessness, revealing nothing but its own vapid emptiness.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," Opening wide this weekend:

Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—Final thirds of trilogies of trilogies don’t come along every day. Yet, here we are marking the last chapter of the nine-movie Star Wars cycle that began in 1977, and it feels, to me at least, if not a non-event, then just another blockbuster movie. In the film, the heroes visit a festival on a planet that, C-3PO tells us, is only celebrated “every 42 years.” But I haven’t had much similar feeling of grand occasion about the 42-year anniversary this movie represents.

This may be because, at this point, the Star Wars franchise is so embedded in our culture that there’s no sense of it ever really going away; prequels and spinoffs and TV shows can and likely will continue for decades to come. But maybe it’s also because Star Wars, by remaining so inviolate in its look, in its onscreen conventions and in its actors, has never been “rebooted” like the Marvel movies or Star Trek or the other big sci-fi fantasy series it made possible. And thus it’s come to seem a little quaint, old-fashioned, something for hardcore older fans to squabble over while younger moviegoers mutter “OK Boomer” under their breath.

Or maybe my perception is completely wrong on this, and the movie-going world has been trembling with anticipation for this day. In any case, it’s quite an enjoyable movie.


Turns out Emperor Palpantine (good old nasty, raspy Ian McDiarmid) is not quite dead after all, and he has diabolical plans for Skywalker-gone-bad Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and warrior woman Rey (Daisy Ridley). Soon the ragtag band of heroes — reformed Stormtrooper John Boyega; hotshot pilot Oscar Isaac, Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) and chic warrior Naomi Ackie etc etc — are searching for the Emperor’s lair, or rather for some McGuffin that will lead them to his lair.


This leads them across multiple worlds, and I appreciated how director J.J. Abrams and the filmmakers tried to create some new planetary looks. There’s a sort of Pacific Northwest beach planet where the gang visits the wreckage of the Death Star, and another stop that looks like a medieval village in winter.

The spectacle is splendid and the actors agreeable; top-billed Carrie Fisher lends her potent presence via previously unused footage, and other cast members from the earliest films turn up. The dialogue hits with a thud now and then, but that’s true throughout the series. The episodic set pieces are, in their way, as important as the overarching saga; my own favorite here, I think, was the encounter with a giant cotton-mouthed sand snake. And as is true these days of almost any mythic tale, especially any involving corrupt hatemongering villains, it’s hard to shake a vague sense of allegory for our troubled times.

On that note…


Bombshell—No bloated alien monster in the history of the Star Wars series was ever quite as grotesque and repellent as Fox News honcho Roger Ailes, played here by John Lithgow. He even mentions being referred to as “Jabba the Hutt” at one point. It’s to the great actor’s credit that, as usual, he gives us a glimpse of the defiantly miserable human under the blanket of moral rot. Ailes, who died in 2017, less than a year after stepping down as CEO of Fox, is alleged to have sexually harassed numerous women over his long career.

Charlize Theron plays Megyn Kelly, watching from the sidelines as her fellow on-air talent Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is fired for defying Ailes, and retaliates with a lawsuit. Both stars are terrific; Kidman with her frazzled former-beauty-queen dignity, and Theron capturing Kelly’s deep, companionable, one-of-the-boys tones superbly. There are third and fourth blondes, too; Margot Robbie plays a “composite” character representing the CEO’s typical target, and Robbie and coworker Kate McKinnon make, improbably, one of the cuter movie couples of the year.

Directed by Jay Roach of the Austin Powers flicks and featuring a huge cast including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Susan Estrich and Richard Kind as Rudy Giuliani, the film is fast-moving, funny and snarky, something in the manner of 2015’s The Big Short. The scenes dramatizing the encounters between Ailes and his victims are hard to watch, pathetic and squalid and infuriating, and of course necessary for the film to have any validity, and there’s an undeniable pleasure in seeing him (sort of) defeated.

But if Bombshell doesn’t score a direct emotional hit, it may be for an unfair partisan reason: Harassment happens everywhere, of course, regardless of political ideology or sexual preference, but considering the stated values of the place these women worked, well, what did they expect? “I’d love to be slut-shamed,” remarks an office drudge in this film; that’s probably an accurate representation of the mindset of many women in that sort of environment, and also, alas, a longtime justification for the men around them.

Bombshell—No bloated alien monster in the history of the Star Wars series was ever quite as grotesque and repellent as Fox News honcho Roger Ailes, played here by John Lithgow. He even mentions being referred to as “Jabba the Hutt” at one point. It’s to the great actor’s credit that, as usual, he gives us a glimpse of the defiantly miserable human under the blanket of moral rot. Ailes, who died in 2017, less than a year after stepping down as CEO of Fox, is alleged to have sexually harassed numerous women over his long career.

Charlize Theron plays Megyn Kelly, watching from the sidelines as her fellow on-air talent Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman) is fired for defying Ailes, and retaliates with a lawsuit. Both stars are terrific; Kidman with her frazzled former-beauty-queen dignity, and Theron capturing Kelly’s deep, companionable, one-of-the-boys tones superbly. There are third and fourth blondes, too; Margot Robbie plays a “composite” character representing the CEO’s typical target, and Robbie and coworker Kate McKinnon make, improbably, one of the cuter movie couples of the year.

Directed by Jay Roach of the Austin Powers flicks and featuring a huge cast including Malcolm McDowell as Rupert Murdoch, Allison Janney as Susan Estrich and Richard Kind as Rudy Giuliani, the film is fast-moving, funny and snarky, something in the manner of 2015’s The Big Short.

"Dec 20, 2019"," “Endings are hard, especially for me,” director J.J. Abrams recently said when discussing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. That’s understandable. His new film is intended to serve as a conclusion to both Disney’s Star Wars sequel trilogy and the entire Skywalker saga that first began with George Lucas all the way back in 1977. Landing that speeder is akin to successfully firing on a thermal exhaust port just two-meters wide—it’s a one-in-a-million shot that requires an assist from the Force. Star Wars is the most intensely scrutinized blockbuster franchise in the world, and both its supporters and its critics are really good at yelling. Ending it in a universally satisfying conclusion simply isn’t possible and The Rise of Skywalker reflects that reality. That raises the central question that has come to define this new era of Star Wars: What the hell do fans want? They want the new Star Wars trilogy to capture the magic of the original series while simultaneously standing on its own as new and unique creations. They want to be emotionally invested in the characters, but only if they adhere to a strict guideline of development. They don’t want their Star Wars movies filled with politics, even though A New Hope was a fantastical response to the Vietnam War. They want these films to make them feel like they did when they were children while still appealing to adults. The checklist of expectations and desires is simply a collection of oppositional mandates. If we hyper-analyze these movies, we’ll always find something they can do better. If we allow them to exist as they are with the acceptance of imperfection, they will be easier to enjoy. Neither is a particularly simple ask. Some choices made by Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio feel like unnecessary course corrections from Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, which drew the ire of a small but vocal contingent of viewers despite being the highest grossing film of 2017. The duality was striking; a critically praised global blockbuster that nonetheless proved so polarizing that we’re still arguing about its merits and missteps two years later. The Last Jedi has it flaws—as all Star Wars movies do—but Johnson’s bold ambition to deconstruct the Jedi mythos and subvert our expectations while side-stepping fan theories is not one of them. By acknowledging that the Jedi Order was plagued by “hypocrisy, hubris,” Johnson’s film theoretically freed the franchise to move into new territory that didn’t rely on hero worship and institutions that the 40-year-old franchise had grown beyond. Abrams has instead instituted a “return to normalcy” that recalibrates the finale’s focus on familiar yet effective construction rather than challenging its audience. In other words, it’s Lucasfilm’s attempt to provide what the studio believes audiences are clamoring for. The emotional highs of The Rise of Skywalker are undoubtedly fantastic as it attempts to convey that you can choose your own destiny and that there are things more powerful than blood. It is often a swashbuckling adventure film that sparks the kid inside of you as it delivers a series of big movie moments ripe for broad appeal. The dynamic between Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren/Ben Solo (Adam Driver) is the foundational support beam of the film, and the sequel trilogy as a whole, as it delivers the emotional stakes fans want. Both characters straddle the line between light and dark and represent both the best and the worst of the Force while exhibiting how the two can be interchangeable at times. Through them, we understand how easily power, whether wielded with noble intentions or not, can yield unintended consequences that alter who you are. The Rise of Skywalker entertains, it elicits laughters, and it makes you feel even as you snicker at some predictably basic and occasionally nonsensical story decisions. It delivers a succession of payoffs, some of which are earned, some of which are not, and some of which are simply disappointing retcons. It does not necessarily make you think as its thematic punching power belongs in a lighter weight class than some of its franchise predecessors. Which side of the spectrum do the majority of Star Wars fans want to plant their flag? Those who hated The Last Jedi will find its opposite in Skywalker (the Force must be balanced), and yet the two films are ironically inseparable—juxtapositions of one another that inspire intense fandom that exist in conflicting directions. Is it the duty of a studio and filmmaker to cater to those who critique or those who worship? Both? Neither? As an imperfect product, The Rise of Skywalker can’t offer a definitive answer. The court of public opinion is never adjourned. But if we had to venture a guess, the final entry in the Skywalker saga will do what all movies do—inspire both love and hate. At the end of the day, what fans really want most is something to talk about. We get it: you like to have control of your own internet experience.

"Dec 20, 2019"," When it comes to mega-myths and long-standing pop culture phenomenons, endings are one of the most impossible things to get right. The Rise of Skywalker already had a tough act to beat by following The Last Jedi—easily the most narratively and thematically complex film that Star Wars has ever churned out. But it’s doubtful that Episode IX ever intended to outdo its predecessor, and what we have for a coda has much more in common with an oft-maligned chapter of the Skywalker Saga: Return of the Jedi. Machinations are grandiose and sometimes utterly ridiculous in Episode IX. It’s easy to grouse over how unrealistic many of those plot twists are, but this is Star Wars we’re talking about—the film franchise that has always built its conflicts on bigger ways to blow stuff up and bigger bads to fell in exceedingly dramatic ways, for exceedingly dramatic reasons. While it may be a bug rather than a feature, it’s consistent. If The Rise of Skywalker disappoints you, it’s likely to be for the silliness of those grander schemes, or for the fact that it doesn’t use much of The Last Jedi as groundwork for its conclusion (which is a genuine shame at points). A similar structure holds true for Return of the Jedi, and in that regard, The Rise of Skywalker has many of its same strengths; namely, it’s genuinely fun, at times achingly eager, and prioritizes character development and emotional turmoil. The third Star Wars trilogy has been a sleeker exercise by far than the other two, which means that even when it’s a little sappy and overwrought, a lot of those moments work by the sheer will of its talent. Seeing the bonds between Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) grow as they navigate all the terror the galaxy throws at them is beautiful to behold. All the people who hold the Resistance together, who come to its aid, from familiar and beloved faces like Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) to newcomers like Jannah (Naomi Ackie), make the movie brighter and power the story via endless charisma and knowhow. It’s sad to know that this is likely the last we’ll see of any of them on screen, after growing so instantly attached to them all. There is an absence in this film that cannot be understated. The loss of Carrie Fisher after The Last Jedi finished production meant that all of her scenes in The Rise of Skywalker were cobbled together from unused footage in The Force Awakens. It’s truly impressive how well her presence works and how painstakingly her scenes have been knit into the narrative, but there are clear beats that are missing without her, and it’s easy to tell how much space she was originally going to take up in the story had she not passed away. It’s difficult not to miss her, even when you’re staring right at her, not to mourn the journey we all deserved to see for our beloved General. Her final bow is bittersweet, but there are many others that don’t hurt quite so badly. Listening to John Williams’s score pay him back in a million little ways as he ties together decades worth of symphonic storytelling is an utter joy to bear witness to. He has a cameo in the film to watch out for, a fitting glimpse of a person who is perhaps more responsible for Star Wars than anyone who ever worked on it, creator George Lucas included. The soundtrack of Star Wars is Star Wars, and nowhere is it more evident than in his very last installment. The Rise of Skywalker isn’t big on explaining things, so if you’re expecting a lot of intimate details on how major plots points come to be, there won’t be much to save you. It’s also fascinating to see how much of the film relies on knowledge from the prequels and the television series’ that have materialized thus far, from Clone Wars to Rebels to The Mandalorian. It doesn’t mean that the audience will be totally at sea without reference points, but it absolutely enriches the viewing experience (especially when it comes to Sith history and character cameos). It’s likely that this was always going to be a problem for Rise of Skywalker, as it has the unenviable job of tying up the majority of a story that Star Wars has been telling over the past forty-odd years. Even if we never see specific references to events of the Clone Wars or the struggles of the Mandalorian people, all of these elements still have to work in concert. Some of those places where the film pulls those decades of history together (both in universe and out) are flat-out gorgeous. The plot starts us off with a jaunty scavenger hunt vibe that serves the film well before the messier arcs take over and everything gets complicated. There is also one major reversal from The Last Jedi that feels a lot like cheating on writer-director JJ Abrams’s part, though it’s not surprising to see him assert his original vision for the trilogy over other avenues that Rian Johnson’s Episode VIII tried to explore. To his credit, the one place the film never skimps is on its characters, the only reason most of us were charmed into caring about the third Star Wars trilogy in the first place. We see Rey, Poe, and (really, especially) Finn figure out who they want to be, and how the coming events will shape their futures. The same is true for Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is finally given some nuance and history to play with, and he makes use of every second he’s given on screen. There are themes at work here that feel particularly timely and relevant to the era in which we find ourselves. Among those are the acknowledgement that fascism and evil can only flourish by making us feel isolated from one another, making us forget that we have friends, networks, supports in place to keep us from faltering. But perhaps more essential is a piece of wisdom given to us by a trusted veteran—that no one knows what they’re doing. Good work isn’t about having battle plans and thorough organization and going in knowing exactly how you’re going to win the day. And all the people who seem like they’ve got it together? They don’t. Essentially, Imposter Syndrome is real, even for leaders and great hopes of the galaxy. The only way you manage is by letting it go, and moving forward. Imperfect as it is, The Rise of Skywalker often feels like being wrapped up in a warm blanket. It’s not a risky venture, but it has enough heart to power a galaxy. And that makes for a fitting ending in my book. Emmet Asher-Perrin loves Return of the Jedi, for the record. In case you were wondering where they landed on this one.

"Dec 20, 2019"," The release of Star Wars – with its wondrous combination of imaginary religious conflicts and wisdom, whiz-bang special effects, and delightful cast – took the very notion of a Hollywood “blockbuster” to another level. It also surpassed every pundit’s wildest fantasy, as George Lucas and his merry band of space cowboys broke box office records while simultaneously building a religion and legacy of their own. Lore swiftly became legend, and Star Wars became one of the most popular franchises in entertainment history. And with the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the journey of characters carrying the names of Skywalker, Solo, and Palpatine is finally complete. The biggest question of this entire film is how do I review a movie no one wants to know anything specific about? Quite literally, any time you begin to utter even a whiff of this space magic mumbo-jumbo, immediately you are met with side-eye fierce enough to wipe out the wickedest of Jedi Masters. So I decided, for this one time, I’m just going to keep it simple and light. These will not be the spoilers you’re looking for. Here is all you need to know about the story: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) have been tasked with locating a hidden planet that contains the key to bringing down the entirety of The First Order, now led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Still conflicted with his connection to Rey, Kylo – aka Ben Solo – struggles and pontificates on his place in this world throughout the film, as Rey continues to force forward towards completing her journey and saving the galaxy. And yes, Rey and Kylo continue their back-and-forth psychic shenanigans about who is worth redemption, and who is truly pulling whom into the Dark Side. Basically, it’s Return of the Jedi with a metric shit-ton of additional electrical effects and substantially better catering. Returning to helm the final nail in this trilogy of trilogies is The Force Awakens’ J.J. Abrams, a director who already perfectly captured the nostalgia of the original, while successfully introducing us to characters we now know and love. After the social media beat down that The Last Jedi received, it also becomes painfully obvious within the first few minutes of Rise of Skywalker that Abrams had an entirely different take on the middle movie of this trilogy than director Rian Johnson did. It’s a skittering start as Abrams crams an entire movie of ideas into 20-30 minutes of screen time in order to catch us up to speed for his final two hours of breakneck pacing. But you came here to find out if it all works, right? Does J.J. and the gang have what it takes to bring home The Rise of Skywalker as a rousing celebration of the world of Star Wars and every ounce of nostalgia and childhood whimsy the franchise has stood for over the last 40+ years? Will audiences walk out of the theaters with a grin so wide it can be spotted from a galaxy far, far away? The short answer to that is…kinda? There are moments that work magnificently. Set-pieces pop as we salivate over speeder chases and lightsaber battles seemingly pulled directly from the recesses of our childhood imaginations. Beloved characters pop up left and right to have their longtime arcs acknowledged and respected. Scenes to close loops that fans have clamored for arise constantly as if to say, “Hey buddy, thanks for buying all those toys over the years, this is for YOU!” The term “Fan Service” is tossed around far too leisurely these days, as if giving fans – the people who live, breathe, and finance the very things they love – what they want is somehow a negative. Audiences deserve to be challenged, sure, and also to be treated as if their love for a property they’ve supported blindly for decades matters. Because it does. Yes, there is a lot of fan service in Rise of Skywalker, and most of it is a wonderfully joyous gift to fans of every generation. If you don’t like every aspect of it, go write some fanfic of your own while you whine online, nestled up in your Chewbacca onesie. Where it does take a turn towards the less positive is how safe Abrams plays it. At least three times throughout Rise of Skywalker, a prominent character is alluded to be in imminent peril. As the final piece in a 9-film puzzle, we as fans expect this, even welcome it. Give us some real stakes, kill off your darlings and let us have something to play for. It’s a war with the greatest military in the ENTIRE GALAXY bringing all its might down on civilians in every system, there must be casualties! Yet, each and every time, Abrams brings in the safety net, puts on a helmet, pats us on the head and whispers “not today, kids.” The first time this happens, OK, subvert our expectations and don’t take a fan favorite from us. You got us that time, J.J.! But after the third time, it becomes painfully obvious that after the fan rebellion over the last couple of films, Abrams and Disney are legitimately terrified of doing anything even remotely bold to upset their fan base. Even the potential fall of the Resistance never truly feels in jeopardy as it faces overwhelming odds, and it absolutely should. It needs to feel overwhelmingly dire. None of this makes The Rise of Skywalker a bad movie, not in any respect, but it is definitely wearing a cinematic seat belt of epic proportions. There are zero genuine stakes in this finale, and that is the film’s biggest weakness. Its biggest strength is the cast, and I mean all of them. Separated for far too long in The Last Jedi (and in a wandering, ultimately pointless arc in the case of Finn), the new guard are reunited and it feels so good! Ridley is still the glue that holds this entire trilogy together – carrying more emotion in one glance than most franchise characters muster in three entire films – and the camaraderie between her, Finn, and Poe is intoxicating. Throw in Chewie, C3PO, Lando, R2D2, Leia (yes, they pay as much respect as possible to our wonderful princess, Carrie Fisher), Kylo, a host of surprise callbacks to the entirety of the Skywalker saga, and you have a cast of characters with the potential to catapult you to full-on seat bouncing at any given moment. As a complete entity, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has its issues and plays it too safe, but it remains an entertaining film that families and friends can enjoy together for years to come. Rip-roaring space battles, fantastic oceanic ballet dancing with laser swords, droid hijinks, romantic entanglements, and more subplots resolved than sand grains kicked up whenever Rey races through Jakku. J.J. Abrams burst through the door with one mission: wrap the Skywalker Saga up with a nice enough bow that no self-respecting fan can spend another five years destroying it online. And that he did. This may not be the exact film you’re looking for, but there is little doubt the Force remains with us.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","Clunky and bit complex, JJ Abrams does the impossible with trying to end the ""Star Wars"" saga with the competent and enjoyable ""The Rise of Skywalker"" but it ends up playing it safe and not taking enough narrative risks to stick a perfect landing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," The Star Wars sequel trilogy, which began when Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, limps to the finish line with the new Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, an extravaganza of fan service, exposition, and leaden, McGuffin-based plotting. There are some nice moments, but overall, it’s by far the weakest film of the three sequels. The film wraps up the stories of young Jedi adventurer Rey (Daisy Ridley), cocky pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), ex-storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), and wannabe Darth Vader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), along with supporting characters old and new. These resolutions are rather satisfying. It's just the getting there that's the problem. The Rise of Skywalker is directed by J.J. Abrams, who returns after making the first film in the trilogy, 2015's The Force Awakens, which was thrilling but largely stuck to the formula of the original 1977 Star Wars. In the interim came 2017's The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, which took risks, upended assumptions, and was therefore hated by large swaths of the hardcore Star Wars fandom. I'm firmly on Team Johnson. I thought The Last Jedi was the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy, a beautifully rendered, expertly plotted effort that both brought new ideas into the franchise and provided an outstanding showcase for its long-absent original hero, Luke Skywalker. But I'm not a of J.J. Abrams hater, and mostly enjoyed The Force Awakens, so I was willing to give the director a chance. With The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams walks back numerous key aspects of The Last Jedi. A certain shocking revelation in that film is retconned out of existence through laughable plot machinations. The character of Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), introduced in Last Jedi, is sidelined and given almost nothing to do, while both the ""anyone can be a Jedi"" ethos and all of that stuff with Benicio Del Toro talking about war profiteering in the Star Wars galaxy goes out the window too. And even worse than that, the film is missing The Last Jedi's visual inventiveness. There's nothing anywhere close to the sequence in the middle of Johnson's film with the throne room, leading into Laura Dern piloting the ship. The Last Jedi also had at least a dozen memorable shots, while Rise of Skywalker has fewer than that. But it's not just those changes that hurt The Rise of Skywalker. The first half of the plot is just an endless series of McGuffins upon McGuffins, as the characters keep having to go to one planet in order to get something that unlocks something else on another planet, a la Infinity Stones. It's also meant to be a mystery which character is a ""spy,"" although guessing the spy's identity is pretty easy. There's one mistake that's worse than anything else. The film kicks off, in the trademark opening crawl, by letting us know that a certain long-dead character has inexplicably returned and is now the main antagonist. And we're told this character has been pulling the strings all along. It's just terrible storytelling as, much like in the most recent James Bond film, this retconning renders moot years of plotting across multiple movies. For that reason, Rise of Skywalker falls into that unfortunate tendency, also present in the Avengers universe and all over movies and TV these days, that the stakes have stopped mattering because death has become meaningless. Why should we care about the prospect of a character dying, when we know they already came back from the dead once and could do it again? Plus, the bad guy's supposedly long-in-the-works master plan changes about five times throughout the film. Carrie Fisher returns as Leia, despite having passed away nearly three years ago. The performance is assembled from past footage, Trail of The Pink Panther-style, although this aspect is fairly well-done, considering the challenges the directors had in giving her character a resolution (Fisher died after The Last Jedi completed shooting but a year before its release.) There are some enjoyable moments, especially the resolution of the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship, and a long list of fun cameos, surprises and Easter eggs. It's still, above all else, a Star Wars movie, and has space battles, lightsaber fights, and moments of surprising emotional connection, that one goes to Star Wars movies to take in. And for all its deficiencies, it's still better than all three prequels. But ultimately, The Rise of Skywalker suffers from comparison to The Last Jedi, which showed what a Star Wars movie could be, in the hands of a great director willing to take a huge swing.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 20, 2019"," PLOT:  One year after almost crushing the Rebellion once and for all, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) finds an unlikely ally in the resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) – who demands Ren bring him Rey (Daisy Ridley), who’s off training as a Jedi under the tutelage of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Meanwhile, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) discover there’s a spy in the First Order, and hatch a daring plan to end their reign once and for all. REVIEW:  No one could have predicted that the first Disney STAR WARS trilogy would be so controversial. After a fan-pleasing start with THE FORCE AWAKENS, THE LAST JEDI wound up being one of the most polarizing blockbusters in recent memory ((I’m unapologetic about the fact that I liked it – with a few caveats), clearly leading to some creative reshuffling at Disney, with J. J. Abrams returning to give the hard-core fans the final installment they’ve been demanding. That said, is the thing they’ve always said they wanted really what they want after all? The early reaction suggests THE RISE OF SKYWALKER will be no less controversial than THE LAST JEDI, with many already accusing the filmmakers of playing it safe with an uneven, by-the-numbers entry. Sure enough, the first act is a total mess, with the opening crawl working overtime to catch us up on what’s been happening in a galaxy far, far away – with Palpatine having already been revived for some time. This element makes it feel like there’s a movie missing, as so much seems to have happened between THE LAST JEDI and this that the effect is jarring for the first half of the film. Similarly, the reappearance of the late Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia is jarring, with the use of stock footage and CGI far from seamless. Couldn’t there have been a better way to give the character some closure than by resurrecting her with “not quite there” CGI? Luckily, things settle down somewhere towards the middle of the second act, and while uneven, there are things about THE RISE OF SKYWALKER that really work. For one, the relationship between Kylo Ren and Rey is as intriguing as always, with Adam Driver nailing Ren’s increasingly conflicted nature, even as he gets closer to the emperor. Daisy Ridley has also proven herself to be iconic as a heroine, with this delving into her attraction and draw to the dark side in a way that allows her to show off a vicious side that up to now we haven’t seen. Again though, another film showing her struggling with the pull of the dark side might have made the finale more effective. One of the biggest complaints about THE LAST JEDI was how Oscar Isaac’s Poe was turned into a reckless ne’er do-well, and that’s been corrected here, with him once again the heroic Rebellion pilot with a roguish side. He’s Han meets Wedge, and Isaac is magnetic as always (someone give him a franchise already). His bromance with John Boyega’s Finn is played up, with them rarely apart. As far as the baddies go, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER benefits from more screentime for Richard E. Grant’s snivelling first order baddie. He was made to be in these movies (by contrast, Domhnall Gleeson’s Hux is a glorified extra). So far these are the changes that work. However, the so-called “course correction” also goes too far at times, with clumsy re-writing to bring Palpatine into the universe, and the question of Rey’s lineage is dealt with in a way that makes it painfully clear that whatever the plan was for her in the first two films has been hastily revised here. Finally, one of the saddest concessions to critics of the last film is how Rose Tico is sidelined, with Kelly Marie Tran barely having a role at all. I get a lot of fans had a big problem with her, but did she have to be sidelined so completely? There’s even a scene where the main crew is getting ready to go on a mission and she says “no I’ll stay behind and take care of Leia”, meaning you virtually never see her at all. She doesn’t get a single moment to shine, making me wonder why Abrams even brought her back in the first place. It’s too bad because (for me anyway) the character was a welcome addition to THE LAST JEDI, although I suppose I’m in the minority. Another huge problem with THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is the endless series of fake-outs, with nonstop scenes of one of our heroes apparently on the verge of death or dying, only to be resurrected minutes later. In some ways, this is in the classic serial tradition, but Abrams takes it too far here, to the point that by the time the final battle happens you feel like there are no stakes whatsoever. This is the anti-AVENGERS: ENDGAME. There is a laundry list of things THE RISE OF SKYWALKER doesn’t quite get right, but the fact remains that in the end, this is still STAR WARS, meaning it’s watchable enough even if it pales next to something like “The Mandalorian” (give Jon Favreau and Deborah Chow the next trilogy!). When the John Williams score starts pumping, you can’t help but get excited, and on a technical level, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is impeccable, with great CGI creatures (although the de-aging is definitely not Marvel-level) and sharp cinematography by Dan Mindel (there’s a welcome absence of lens flares). There are some wonderful bits and pieces here and there (including Billy Dee Williams’s long overdue return as Lando and a blink and you’ll miss it cameo from an original trilogy favorite), but it’s a compromised end to a compromised trilogy. Part of me thinks this is what happens when you have too many cooks, and really, it should have been J.J. Abrams guiding the trilogy all along, as you need the one voice if you’re going to make it work. Still, it’s worth seeing (it’s STAR WARS!) just go in with your hopes in check. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Just so we're keeping score, we started this final trilogy in the original Star Wars canon with J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens, a film welcomed after the disastrous second trilogy that George Lucas helmed before selling LucasFilm to the Mouse in the early 2000s.  That film offered fans a return to the old, swashbuckling style of the first series (and, yes, to make a continued petty point, my utter disdain for the last film in the original trilogy is such that I only count the first two), even if it followed, in many places nearly beat-for-beat, the original film's plot points and trajectory. There wasn't a lick of originality to the thing, but it aped A New Hope well enough to still be a relief for Star Wars fans everywhere.  The second installment, The Last Jedi, was, as a friend of mine likes to say, a horse of a different color. Written and directed by Rian Johnson, a genuinely clever filmmaker with a delicious sense of plotting (see his latest film, Knives Out for confirmation), Jedi veered far from the staid course Abrams had set up, and instead gleefully pushed the series forward into more uncharted territory. It was also the first film since The Empire Strikes Back that felt laden with possibility, as if freed from the weighty baggage of what had happened before. It felt new and daring.  The result was a full-on uprising from certain sects of the fanboy collective: Johnson, they felt, hadn't ""respected"" Lucas' original characters as much as he should have, and the film's turn towards greater diversity got him labeled derisively as a Social Justice Warrior. Many fans (and critics) felt otherwise, but the outcry was enough that the Disney overlords obviously heard the wailing (even if it still made $1.3 billion worldwide).  Which brings us to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams' return to bring the series home. A safe bet to better abide by the strict fanboy rules, Abrams has repaid Disney's faith in him by delivering a dutiful, on-point final installment, albeit one bereft of any sort of genuine inspiration. Gone is the sense of new possibilities, and the storytelling juice to explore them, in place of that, we have what Abrams (and many other filmmakers before him) nearly always resort to when their storylines are weak: Relentless, often unjustified, action. Like a little kid who's feasted on a box of Honey Smacks, the film jumps around as if it's afraid to keep still. It rips from scene to scene so quickly that the pace itself becomes its primary attraction, a blurry whirl of plot points hurtling past that make little sense outside their need to happen for the story to continue pushing its turbo-injected RPMs.  In such a rush to close all loops and answer all questions, the plot careens us around the galaxy in full hyperspace mode, but to condense it into a usable paragraph: As the film begins, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is meeting on a secret, secluded planet with Dark Lord Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who wants the lad to continue his legacy of evil dominance, even as Ren himself has plans to take him out and rule the galaxy himself. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training with Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, using archive footage and CGI), as Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) race around gathering intel against the rising First Order. As Ren pursues Rey, both across space and the mind-meld they established in the last film, she learns more and more from him about who she is, and what her lineage has to do with Palpatine's horrible ""final order"" (any resemblance between the First Order and Nazi Germany is absolutely intended). As these things naturally go, everything ends up in a cataclysmic final battle against the First Order, with everyone putting everything on the line, one last time.  A major issue with this last trilogy has been the indistinct nature of the new group of characters. With Awakens, it seemed as if too many of the new faces were simply younger replacements for the old guys (in this scenario, Rey=Luke, Poe=Han, Ren=Vader, and so forth). If nothing else, at least Abrams' follow-up has finally made at least Rey feel more her own person, at least as much of a fleshed-out character so as not to seem so transparently Luke-esque.  Poe remains a weak and lazy Solo ripoff (I'm generally a fan of Isaac's, but it must be said the actor adds very little to the thin gruel of a role).  And as much as I admire Driver, I still don't feel as if he was a good choice for Ren. But at least Ridley has come into her own. The best moments in this film all revolve around her conviction as Rey, as powerful and conflicted as she is.  Abrams had a particularly thankless job here, admittedly, but it's a terrible shame that the series lands here with such a thud. Everyone played it safe, placating the lifers whose feelings were bruised by The Last Jedi, ensuring a stream of holiday money, but with the exception of Jedi, I very much doubt these films will be much remembered beyond their initial cash grabs. The fanaticism of Star Wars was built from the unadulterated love of its initial wave of fans, whose adoration fueled all these sequels; only, after Empire, there have been diminishing returns, at least beyond the box office. There is still a nostalgic love of the original films -- yes, even the one with the damnable Ewoks -- that these subsequent films will never generate. It's worth asking what original content the next generation of filmgoers will be nostalgic for, where this generation's entertainment legacies might take hold. By this point, it feels as if this series has been feeding off its own carcass long enough there are only spindly bones remaining.  Some 36 years ago, the world was met with The Return of the Jedi, a cynical, sell-out insult of a film that George Lucas completely punted on, in favor of little kid marketability (not that I'm the least bit bitter about this) and gummy plot resolution. For fans of Empire, the strongest film of the series, it was a total betrayal, with Lucas more or less ignoring the intriguingly salient elements of the previous film in order to provide his younger viewers with what they might have wanted (Unmitigated happy ending! Everything resolved! More muppets!). It was, of course, his universe to do with as he wished, but his choices (which apparently went contrary to what even Harrison Ford wanted) made for a deeply uninspiring capstone to his vision.  It is at once dispiriting and all too perfect that the trajectory of the last trilogy so directly follows the first. Maybe Abrams, in biting so much from the first film, put this in motion from the start, an ironic repetition of the past, but we have arrived, again, with a depressingly cynical final installment of a franchise that, at one point at least, certainly deserved better.  As a mysterious, dark Lord of the Sith once confidently announced to his former master, ""The circle is now complete."" As such, it's very much time to put the Skywalkers to bed, at last, and free up the galaxy for entirely new possibilities. The force is strong with them, and all of that, but it's clear that there's nothing more to see here.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Home › Reviews › In Theaters › The echoes of the past in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” will have you laugh, cry, gasp, and cheer like you’re a kid again. As written two years ago, Star Wars fans are notoriously hard to please. It seems as though, with every new release, the Fandom finds some aspect to develop disdain for as though these films are serious dramas and not space operas for kids inspired by the Western serials creator George Lucas enjoyed as a child. Yet, here we are again, with a new film which shall undoubtedly inspire new hatred because the already divisive final trilogy of the Skywalker Saga ends by seeking to stick a landing rather than tell a compelling story. Now, some of this is conjecture as it’s impossible to know the inner-workings of returning director J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), but considering the sheer amount of nostalgia in his film, as well as it’s too-close familiarity to ‘77’s A New Hope, it’s not surprising that The Rise of Skywalker seems to coalescence into more in that same vein. This does result in a cinematic experience offering moments unlike anything seen before in any Star Wars film yet, while reaching a conclusion that is deeply satisfying. But by hewing so closely to what’s come before, The Rise of Skywalker lacks any real surprise or weight. L-R: Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, and John Boyega as Finn in STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. Sometime after the small contingent of Resistance fighters escaped from the Battle of Crait, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are on a mission from General Organa (Carrie Fisher) to find intel on the First Order’s plans while Rey (Daisy Ridley) trains in the ways of the Force. Things seem bad when news of an imminent attack reaches the Resistance, but they become worse when they discover that the only way to prevent it is to head straight into the heart of the Sith. On the one hand, longtime Star Wars fans will have all of their pleasure centers tapped, rubbed, and lovingly massaged for nearly the entire 2hr 21min runtime. This isn’t just because it’s the final film and Abrams proved in Awakens that he knows which nostalgia buttons to press. It occurs because Abrams and screenplay co-writer Chris Terrio (Justice League) mine the entire Saga to close any loops created at any point in Star Wars’s 42-year history. Treating the films as a living-breathing world, you’re bound to see returning faces or observe references to places from long ago. If they were significant in the previous films, they are significant now. Things as small as hearing familiar call signs or as large as seeing Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), these are things which audiences have formed an emotional attachment to and the inclusion of them makes even the oldest audience member feel young again. Like the films before them, Abrams and Terrio take what was established in the ways of the Force previously and build upon them in ways heretofore unseen or thought of, creating audible gasps from the audience. Additionally, Abrams and Terrio manage to close box of mysteries opened in Awakens with minimal disturbance to the overall narrative of the film. As mentioned a moment ago, Skywalker closes the loops, so questions that the audience didn’t even think to ask are explained simply, quickly, and then are moved on from with specificity and haste. There is only one question which lingers throughout the whole of Skywalker and it’s that of Palpatine. The answers have been provided throughout the Saga going back as far as 2002’s Attack of the Clones and have been expounded upon in 2005’s Revenge of the Sith. If you don’t want to rewatch the films or don’t possess the deep lore of the Emperor, take some time to go through film critic Adam Frazier’s The Emperor Reborn series on /Film. Even if you don’t do any of those things, Abrams and Terrio keep things neat and clean, offering a conclusion that’s as big a star war as audience have ever seen with stakes larger than that of ‘83’s Return of the Jedi. On the other hand, for the first time in Star Wars history, the middle film is not used as a spring-board for the final trilogy arc, but is largely erased. This will come to the delight of those who, how to put this delicately, disliked writer/director Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi. The unexpected fallout is that Skywalker sometimes feels in discord with what came before. Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren no longer seems comfortable without his helmet, Rey is in a constant struggle for her identity, Finn and Poe possess trust issues, and other little aspects which generate great character drama on screen that are, in the mere act of being, a show of placation to those who took issue with the films thus far. To be fair, there appear to be several moments purposefully designed to respond to the qualms, concerns, and outright anger-inducing moments of both Awakens and Last Jedi, but, more often than not, Skywalker appears keen to alter, adjust, or disrupt Johnson’s work. As satisfying an end as Abrams and Terrio create, one which fits so nicely and neatly into Lucas’s original method of echo storytelling in which each film bares rhythms and traits of the same numbered film in any of the other trilogies, it does so at the detriment of the current trilogy. This isn’t the time or place to argue about whether Last Jedi is akin to ‘80’s The Empire Strikes Back (which it is in many ways), but it’s worth noting that the viewpoint of Last Jedi — a stark recognition of the failures of the Jedi, that luck isn’t enough, that our personal truth matters — is largely shunted in favor of laser swords, pew-pew guns, and empty heroism. So while Skywalker does feature some of the best sequences in the entire Saga in terms of size, scope, and spectacle, Abrams never seems intent on doing anything surprising, daring, or new. Instead, he tracks directly to where you expect, leaving little to the imagination. Buying a Star Wars ticket is purchasing a promise of action and adventure, of daring deeds by heroes, of swashbuckling with laser swords against cruel doers of evil. It is, ultimately, a tale of good versus evil on a galactic scale told through the microscopic view of one genealogy: the Skywalkers. Since 1977, audiences have gone on this journey and, though it ends, countless families will relive their exploits for generations to come. Truly, Abrams and his team are to be applauded. For all the quibbles, the obvious placations, and the countless moments of fan service, Skywalker truly feels like a conclusion, a final act that puts to rest three generations of combat. The most loving part of the entire film is how the late Carrie Fisher is honored with a narrative arc that makes the best of a heartbreaking situation while also adding more to the myth of General Leia Organa, a feat which certainly seems impossible until Abrams and Terrio accomplish it. Then again, so much of The Rise of Skywalker appears impossible, even likely improbable, until it happens and then, once more, we are returned to a childlike state, in awe of the mysteries of the Force.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," When a voice in the trailer intoned, “No one’s ever really gone,” I didn’t think it was meant literally. J.J. Abrams’s mechanical, nonsensical Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker contains so many resurrections it’s a wonder Disney and Lucasfilm didn’t push back the release date from Christmas to Easter. (They had originally delayed it from Memorial Day to Christmas.) The opening crawl proclaims, “The dead talk!” That’s an understatement. We all thought Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDarmid) was slain in Star Wars: Return of the Jedi (1983). It turns out the Emperor has been amassing planet-killing spacecraft and shadowy armies—they look like Vaderesque clones—to transform the tyrannical First Order into “the Final Order.” Now that ultra-furious Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is the First Order’s Supreme Leader, will he bring his troops into the fold? Meanwhile, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) has been overseeing the Jedi training of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and strengthening what’s left of the Resistance with the help of returning heroes Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran, though if you blink three times you’ll miss her). What connects all these characters is not a rich or logical plot, but a cosmic clothesline on which Abrams hangs obligatory action scenes and exotic set pieces, supposedly rousing demonstrations of rebel solidarity and camaraderie, and an unconscionable number of apparitions, hallucinations, traumatic flashbacks, and disembodied communications. Abrams doesn’t build momentum: he packages spurious energy into a bloated circus. The result: a plummeting comedown from Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), by far the most beautiful and emotional entry in the Skywalker trilogy that started with Abrams’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Writer-director Rian Johnson, in The Last Jedi, expertly tied the moral imbalance in the cosmos to the raging depths within Rey and Kylo Ren. Johnson also handed Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker a simple, lucid lecture on the Force: he taught Rey to “reach out” to the elements of the universe “with your feelings” and experience the energy “between it all” and “inside you.” (Yes, the Beatles had it right: the Force, like life, “flows on within you and without you.”) Some of the most affecting moments in The Last Jedi came when Rey and Kylo connected long-distance via some mystic pipeline and when Luke recharged his own mind-bending powers to full Force. Abrams’s The Rise of Skywalker repeats the same or comparable motifs without visual or dramatic oomph or clarity. When Rey briefly faces a vicious doppelganger, the imagery is so pedestrian it’s as if she sees herself as an evil twin made up for Halloween. Worse, Abrams and his cowriter Chris Terrio (Argo), who share story credit with Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, wildly overdraw on our willing suspension of disbelief as they exhume expired characters or revive moribund warriors after mortal combat. A modified Romeo and Juliet-type climax earns a thunderous bad laugh. This movie means to cap not just the Rey odyssey that started in The Force Awakens but also the entire “Skywalker saga” that began with A New Hope (1977) or The Phantom Menace (1999), depending on how you’re counting. The storytelling lacks originality and conviction. It simply connects the dots between the Skywalker clan’s legacy and the broader history of freedom vs. repression in Lucas’s galaxy far, far, away. In a video interview from the electronic press kit, Abrams says that what’s central to the series’ appeal is the idea that “the most average among us can be the most extraordinary person” and conquer “terrifying evil.” Yet in his and Terrio’s script, the capacity to channel the Force passes down via bloodlines—a sop to true believers who felt The Last Jedi was being disrespectful when Luke said the Force was bigger than any clan or tribe and did not “belong to the Jedi.” As a writer-director, Abrams focuses on providing the greatest possible number of nostalgic payoffs to Star Wars sentimentalists. The way he sucks up to the fan base is transparent enough to backfire with everyone except zealots. Any salvageable character wins a piece of redemption. The Rise of Skywalker indulges series devotees in “fan service,” then raises it to the level of a veritable fan Mass. It’s too much to swallow. Of course, sidelights still glitter. The globular clownishness of the “astromech droid” called BB-8 remains a welcome contribution to the series, and this time Abrams gives it a scampish foil named D-O: its head resembles the shade to a utilitarian desk lamp and its body looks like a tiny unicycle. We get to savor the spirited shaggy doggishness of Chewbacca the Wookie (played here, as in Jedi, by Joonas Suotamo) and the piquant arcade-game squawks and squeals of R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee). Partway through, Anthony Daniels’s endearingly fussy C-3PO has his memory wiped, resulting in the only funny running gag. Right before, C-3PO pauses and tells Poe he’s “taking one last look, sir, at my friends.” We respond to the poignancy of the moment even if we don’t feel the same way about Poe and his pals. Most of the performers, particularly Isaac and Boyega, are less on an actors’ holiday than a holiday from acting. The movie means for us to embrace Poe, Finn, and Chewie as a team, and to chortle over Poe and Finn’s arrested-adolescent buddyhood. It’s supposed to be a treat to see them work together after being separated through much of The Last Jedi. But Isaac and Boyega look like happy campers, and that’s it. Isaac makes one last-minute attempt at style when he cocks an eye at Keri Russell’s svelte new gangster character, but it would take a better director than Abrams for him to register as a natural, like Dean Martin. Billy Dee Williams glides back into the series as Lando Calrissian and, for a minute or two, achieves what Isaac aims for without breaking a sweat. Ridley and Driver match each other in intensity, but their vibrations get hoovered up inside a vacuum. The lack of atmosphere betrays their efforts to create urgent sexual tension out of nothing. Fisher, so wonderful in Last Jedi, comes off as overly sweet and bland in a performance reportedly put together from The Force Awakens’ outtakes. Both Russell and Naomi Ackle, as another new female character, boast different styles of Amazonian allure, but nary a shred of personality. What could the actors do with Abrams and Terrio’s script? It’s a lot less interesting than the runup novel to The Rise of Skywalker, Rebecca Roanhorse’s Resistance Reborn, which at least does an honest job of furthering the evolution Johnson initiated for Poe in The Last Jedi, from swaggering hot shot to sober commander. Abrams appears intent to stay within Saturday-matinee parameters. He and his team travelled to Wadi Rum in Jordan (one of the prime locations for Lawrence of Arabia) to create the desert planet of Pasaana, which becomes the backdrop for an eye-catching chase. But there’s no resonance to the spectacle, because Abrams, like George H.W. Bush, isn’t into “the vision thing.” In The Last Jedi, Johnson operates like a pop poet; his primal use of the color red made me think of Ingmar Bergman’s statement that “he pictured the inside of the soul as a moist membrane in shades of red.” In The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams labors like an aggregator, suturing bits and pieces from the other films. He may turn a destroyed Death Star from the first trilogy into a key location, but it barely summons a dull menace. Ambition isn’t everything. Ron Howard’s unfairly maligned Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) proved that with genuine wide-screen film sense and gusto, it’s possible to spin the most familiar Star Wars characters into a sparkling entertainment. Solo was deemed a failure because it flopped at the box office. And The Last Jedi has proven so divisive with fans that it may scare Disney and Lucasfilm away from handing big-budget projects to budding auteurs. If The Rise of Skywalker becomes the template for the series going forward, the only Star Wars-related film to look forward to would be Mel Brooks’s Spaceballs 2: The Search for More Money.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Everybody has had that one coworker who dramatically flings and flangs about, causing a commotion to create the illusion that they are doing something complicated and important. Welcome to Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker! Edited to suit our President’s attention span, in open rebellion against the far superior Last Jedi, and crammed with half-baked ideas poached from Reddit fan theory boards, it is a cake made entirely of frosting, a pretty-looking sugar rush with absolutely nothing substantial to hold it together. It is, at best, “fine.” And that’s really what you want in a conclusion to a beloved, sometimes personality-defining series that has spanned more than 40 years, right? “Fine.” Due to insecurity, stubborn foolishness, or fear of a vocal and toxic subset of fans, Rise of Skywalker immediately sets out to undo Last Jedi. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is training to be a Jedi, somehow reading the religious texts that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) literally watched Yoda burn to ashes in the previous film. Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is somehow mostly not-dead and somehow magically generated a vast fleet of ships that all have planet-killing guns on them. He is hiding on the planet Exegol, which is somehow pronounced to rhyme with “testicle.” To get to Exegol, you have to find a magic space triangle. Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Rey, and Chewbacca hop in the Millennium Falcon to hunt for said magic space triangle. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is in hot pursuit, hoping to convince Rey to make a heel turn and go super space naughty, joining him on the throne of the Sith. Stitched together with scenes that last no longer than three minutes each, the whole thing feels like someone threw notes from a brainstorming session in a blender. Reminder: Whoever says “there are no bad ideas in a brainstorming session” is either a filthy liar, JJ Abrams, or both. Here’s the thing about Abrams as a writer/director. His whole schtick is the “mystery box” approach. This holds that getting an audience hooked on questions and the anticipation of answers is more important than whatever answers are actually in that “mystery box.” As the concluding ninth film in the franchise, Rise of Skywalker is literally only about what is in the box. This is akin to asking Smokey the Bear to direct a forest fire. The set pieces look incredible, the cast is charming as hell, and it is relentless in terms of action and spectacle. It’s just all so very hollow. Whereas Last Jedi elevated women, argued about the dangers inherent to blind religious devotion, and suggested that one’s importance is not linked to genetics or a family name, Rise of Skywalker does the exact opposite. Rey is the only non-dude of importance in the film, spiritual dogma is resurrected (literally), and only white people born to powerful families are given anything close to a resolved story arc. The film cowers behind a nebulous, meaningless message that says “the good will always outnumber the bad” and that “the people we love are what really matters.” That last one is hilarious because the movie totally benches Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who ended the last film by professing her love to Finn. Here, the characters behave like terse work colleagues. This is likely because of the fan backlash against Tran. Although it’s very, very good that she likely won’t be subjected to the kind of hate leveled against her after the last installment, it is vastly disappointing to see one of the best new Star Wars characters chased off the screen by gross dudebros. Force Awakens rekindled a specific kind of magic that only Star Wars can generate. Last Jedi was a bold vision of where that magic could be directed. Rise of Skywalker is a tepid, calculated blockbuster designed to be maximally inoffensive. It feels as if Abrams and company were saying “This is what you want, right? Sith stuff? Look at how cool these background characters look!” It’s not bad. Hell, it’s not even in the top three worst Star Wars movies. It’s just disappointing. But hey, at least we have The Mandalorian, right?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," If you disliked ""The Last Jedi"" (like I did), you'll probably like — but maybe not love — ""The Rise of Skywalker."" If you liked ""The Last Jedi,"" this review might not be for you. ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is as visually lush and action packed as you would expect from any ""Star Wars"" movie. The dialogue is clever, the pacing is brisk (its 144 minute running time flies by) and best of all, it leaves audience members with that inimitable glow that can only be felt after being immersed in a genuinely entertaining story. Because it recaptures the magic of the best ""Star Wars"" films — mainly the original trilogy and ""The Force Awakens"" — and avoids the pitfalls of the worst ones, particularly ""The Last Jedi,"" it works as both a fitting conclusion to the Skywalker Saga and a quality popcorn flick. Its main flaw is that — perhaps because it had so much to do and very little time in which to do it — the movie sometimes feels rushed, like it's packing in more than it can handle. This puts it in the same league as 2019's other big blockbuster, ""Avengers: Endgame,"" which also had the unenviable task of needing to provide closure to numerous other films while telling its own satisfyingly self-contained story. Also like ""Avengers: Endgame,"" it mostly succeeds, although at times the plot does strain under the weight of its responsibilities. When ""The Rise of Skywalker"" begins, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her Jedi training while Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) learn a terrible secret from a mole in the evil First Order: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) used the ""unnatural"" powers from the Dark Side of the Force to survive and has been the secret antagonist of the sequel trilogy the entire time. Now it is up to our heroes to thwart Palpatine once and for all before he raises the Final Order and crushes what's left of the Resistance, even as Rey grapples with her intense connection to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), on a mission to lure Rey over to the Dark Side with him. Watching ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" I couldn't shake the sense that director J. J. Abrams, his co-screenwriter Chris Terrio and their co-storytellers Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow were working to undo the damage wrought by ""The Last Jedi,"" which is why that film has to be mentioned quite a bit in this review. (There is more than speculation going on here, as both Abrams and Ridley have criticized that movie.) When you view this film directly after ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi,"" you feel like you've watched a three-act play in which the second act was crafted by an artist with a drastically different vision than the ones who wrote Act One and Act Three. That makes sense, given that J. J. Abrams also directed ""The Force Awakens"" while Rian Johnson wrote and directed ""The Last Jedi."" Overall it gives the ""Star Wars"" sequel trilogy a weirdly inconsistent tone, jumping from classical storytelling to meandering subversiveness, and then back to a classical approach. That classical approach, which has been dismissed by some critics as ""fan service,"" is actually just Abrams and crew appreciating and building upon what it is that people love about the ""Star Wars"" characters and universe. And if there is one thing that I've learned from initially panning a movie because I thought it had too much fan service, and then learning from the error of my ways, it is that fan service should not be dismissed simply for existing. It is only a problem if it isn't well executed. In ""The Rise of Skywalker,"" the fan service is executed very, very well. There are satisfying resolutions for the character arcs of Rey, Poe, Kylo/Ben, Chewbacca, Palpatine, General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and even the droids C-3PO and R2-D2. Abrams deserves particular credit for finding ways of integrating the existing footage of Fisher, who passed away in 2016, into the plot of this film. While this may not have been the character arc they had planned for Leia, one could easily watch this movie and not have guessed that Fisher had died three years before its release. The film is also skilled at bringing back familiar locations for reasons other than stimulating nostalgic affection. Scenes that take place on Endor, Tatooine and other locales in which the earlier films were set don't feel shoehorned, nor do the reappearances of certain key characters from the saga. Yes, these are moments intended to please the crowds (which they did at the screening I attended), and certainly that approach can seem cheap and pandering when done incorrectly. If handled in a way that organically flows from the story, however, those references to earlier characters and locations are precisely what elevates individual scenes from good to great. There is no shame in being deeply moved when that happens. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" also understands that subverting expectations is not in and of itself good storytelling; one has to have a larger vision for the story that makes sense. In ""The Last Jedi,"" expectations were subverted for reasons that did not seem to fit within the grander scheme of the story. The idea of challenging the concepts of having Jedi and Sith was presented, then spontaneously abandoned at the end. Luke Skywalker gave up on his mission in a way that was quite uncharacteristic of him, and while that could have worked if the events which led to that decision were fleshed out in the plot, Johnson instead simply had Luke exposit why he acted as he did amidst scenes so abbreviated they barely count as flashbacks — a violation of one of filmmaking's cardinal rules, which is that you should show and not tell whenever possible. Some of Johnson's subversions even created plot threads that felt like a waste of time; the search for the Master Codebreaker, for example, fizzled out in a way that Johnson may have thought was clever misdirection, but instead came across like he had no idea what to do with the characters of Finn, Rose and BB-8. By contrast, all the surprises and plot threads in ""The Rise of Skywalker"" serve a purpose and make sense. When we finally learn the story of Rey's parents, it is logical given the power that she has displayed and her origins as a scavenger who had been abandoned as a child. Each of the characters' missions and challenges are brought to tidy conclusions and wind up contributing to the climax in significant ways. The deviations from traditional ""Star Wars"" mythology are inspiring instead of insulting: The lesson of Rey's origin and her relationship to Luke and Leia, for example, firmly states that a Jedi's worth comes from her own actions and character. Even the action scenes are better than in previous ""Star Wars"" films: While the fights were overly-choreographed in movies like ""The Phantom Menace,"" here they have a raw, emotional quality to them. The characters aren't merely dancing around while swinging lightsabers, but feel like they are expressing their deepest feelings and motivations. This is not to say that ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is without its flaws. Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) is grossly underutilized, a subplot in which Finn seems ready to reveal key information to Rey is abandoned by the writers, and characters are a bit too on-the-nose in the beginning when discussing how Palpatine was behind the First Order's machinations the entire time. In a similar vein, while McDiarmid is fantastic as always in the role of Palpatine, his character's reintroduction is particularly rushed. You can catch how he was able to be revived if you pay attention closely, but this should have been a big revelation in the movie, and instead is handled in a perfunctory fashion. These are minor quibbles, however, in a story that is ultimately extremely satisfying. I was surprised when I learned that ""The Rise of Skywalker"" had a 56 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes, placing it below the stilted and padded out ""Attack of the Clones"", which is at 65 percent, as well as the already-discussed  ""The Last Jedi,"" which stands at an inexplicable 91 percent. While I doubt the critics' disappointment will hurt this film's box office results, I hope it is not a blot on its overall legacy. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" had a big role as the closing chapter of what can literally be described as a trilogy of trilogies: The three prequels, the three sequels and the three originals. The expectations could not have been higher, and this film deserves credit for meeting them, if not quite surpassing them. Matthew Rozsa is a staff writer at Salon.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Cineasta, docente, y crítico de cine. Miembro de la APRECI —Asociación de Prensa Cinematográfica y la OFCS – Online Film Critics Society. Cofundador y editor en FotografíaCalato.com y NoEsEnSerie.com, y crítico de Cinencuentro.com, MeGustaElCine.com, y Ventana Indiscreta. Cuarenta y dos años. Eso es lo que tuvimos que esperar para ver, por fin, el final de la Saga Skywalker. Por supuesto, inicialmente el final se llevó a cabo en 1983, con el estreno de “El retorno del Jedi”, o técnicamente, en el 2005, con “La venganza de los Sith”. Pero desde que el director J.J. Abrams comenzó una nueva trilogía de la Saga Galáctica en el 2015, con “El despertar de la Fuerza”, y Rian Johnson la continuó hace dos años con “Los últimos Jedi”, varios fanáticos (y otros no tanto) han estado a la espera de este Episodio 9. ¿Cómo cerrarían la trilogía? ¿De verdad se trataría de un desenlace para la Saga Entera? ¿Cómo lograrían hacer que los Episodios 7, 8 y 9 se sientan como una sola historia, coherente y lógica? No iba a ser una tarea fácil. Después de todo, luego del estreno de “Los últimos Jedi”, los fanáticos quedaron divididos en dos: hay quienes apreciaron y disfrutaron del trabajo de Johnson, quien básicamente se dedicó a deconstruir el misticismo de la saga, así como los clichés inherentes al estilo de Lucas, mientras que otros se sintieron traicionados por una historia que, a sus ojos, iba en contra de todo lo que “Star Wars” representa. Además, está el hecho de que la mismísima Princesa Leia, Carrie Fisher, falleció hace más de dos años, y que tanto Luke Skywalker como Han Solo estaban ya muertos dentro del universo de las películas. Súmenle a esto la sorprendente presencia del Emperador Palpatine en los primeros trailers del Episodio 9, y muchos nos comenzábamos a hacer la misma pregunta: ¿qué es lo que haría J.J. Abrams con esta última película? Pues resulta que trató de hacer demasiado. Honestamente, no me sorprende el hecho de que “El ascenso de Skywalker” esté siendo igual de divisoria que su predecesora, por más que, tanto a nivel temático como narrativo, sea el total opuesto a “Los últimos Jedi”. Con un ritmo frenético que nunca le deja respirar al espectador, efectos visuales de primera, excelentes actuaciones por parte del reparto central, y una trama que presenta giros cada cinco minutos, el filme se siente como los Episodios 8 y 9 de Abrams en una sola película; al salir de la sala de cine, me sentí exhausto, como si hubiese visto seis historias complejas a la vez en menos de tres horas. Se trata de una experiencia intensa y extremadamente emotiva —especialmente para los fanáticos— pero que, desgraciadamente, se cae a pedazos si uno la analiza demasiado. No es un desastre, pero definitivamente funciona mejor a nivel emocional que racional. Trataré de no dar demasiados detalles sobre la trama, pero si todavía no han visto la película, les recomiendo que regresen a este texto luego de hacerlo. Al comenzar la cinta, nos enteramos que el Emperador Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) está de vuelta, y le ha mandado un mensaje a la Galaxia: tiene una flota de naves Imperiales, y está dispuesto a usarla para convertirse, nuevamente, en el máximo soberano. Es por ello que nuestros protagonistas, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) y Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) deciden viajar a un planeta lejano, en busca de un artefacto que los llevará al escondite del Emperador. Pero para variar, la Primera Orden los está buscando, esta vez comandados por el Líder Supremo Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) y sus Caballeros de Ren. ¿Podrá Rey convertir a Kylo al Lado Luminoso? ¿Podrá Palpatine convertirse en Emperador nuevamente? ¿Y podrá Abrams contestar todas las preguntas que nos quedaban de las dos cintas anteriores? Mientras que “El Despertar de la Fuerza” se sintió como un reinicio para la saga, mitad secuela y mitad reboot suave, y “Los últimos Jedi” decidió dejar de lado la nostalgia, haciendo uso de una filosofía muy bien explicada por Kylo Ren (“deja morir al pasado; mátalo si es necesario”), “Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker” depende casi enteramente de la nostalgia, trayendo de vuelta muchos de los elementos presentes en las dos primeras trilogías. Se trata de una decisión curiosa, la cual resultará incluso más interesante (o no, dependiendo de a quién le pregunte uno) a la hora de ver las tres películas de un tirón. Porque, a pesar de que la trama del Episodio 9 funciona mientras uno está viendo el filme, sospecho que no se sentirá coherente si es que se le considera como el final de una historia iniciada en el Episodio 7. De hecho, esta última entrega contradice en muchos aspectos al filme de Johnson, lo cual convierte a esta Trilogía en un producto final ecléctico, hasta desigual. Después de todo, mientras que “Los últimos Jedi” le rogaba al espectador que, por favor, olvide el pasado, y deje de ver los eventos de la Trilogía Original y hasta las Precuelas con anteojos de nostalgia, “El ascenso de Skywalker” está obsesionado con el pasado. Por ende, en lugar de la democratización de La Fuerza —un concepto bastante intrigante introducido en el filme anterior—, tenemos, nuevamente, una historia que demuestra que todo el poder de sus personajes está en la sangre que fluye por sus venas. Y por supuesto, tenemos a Palpatine, quien, aparentemente, había estado cumpliendo un rol en la trama de los dos Episodios previos. Aparentemente. Se nota, sin embargo, que nadie lo había siquiera considerado a la hora de escribir “El despertar de la Fuerza” o “Los últimos Jedi” —ni Abrams ni Johnson. Esto hace que la reaparición del buen Darth Sidious se sienta repentina, hasta ilógica. Por otro lado, muchas de las preguntas que los fanáticos habían tratado de responder por años son consideradas en este nuevo capítulo, finalmente —el problema es que no todas las respuestas son igual de satisfactorias. En general, las revelaciones hechas por el guion de Abrams y Chris Terrio (“Argo”, “Batman v Superman”) no me molestaron demasiado, pero a la vez, se sienten obvias, como algo sacado de un fan fiction, y no como desarrollos naturales de la narrativa, o al menos extensiones de los dos capítulos anteriores. Admito que muchos de los giros que Abrams desarrolla en la película me dejaron en shock —es decir, funcionaron “en el momento”—, pero una vez que traté de justificarlos, simplemente no funcionaban. “El ascenso de Skywalker” es un filme más preocupado en justificar su propia existencia y en mover a sus personajes de un lado a otro, que en crear enlaces sólidos con las aventuras anteriores. Lo cual es una pena, porque se trata de una película innegablemente entretenida, la cual claramente ha sido estructurada de tal manera que la mayoría de fanáticos se sientan satisfechos. Los Easter Eggs abundan, las secuencias de acción son rápidas y furiosas, los efectos visuales son verdaderamente de primera, y el filme hasta incluye un par de momentos que nos remontan a los tiempos antes de esta Trilogía (los cuales, estoy seguro, nos hubiera gustado ver mejor desarrollados en otras producciones). Nuevamente, “Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker” es una cinta que no quiere dejar morir al pasado; quiere hacérnoslo recordar, y quiere tratarnos de decir que el pasado es extremadamente importante para los eventos del presente. No se trata de un mal tema para desarrollar —el problema es que nunca fue un tema en el que las dos películas anteriores estuviesen especialmente interesadas. Lo cual me lleva a la siguiente pregunta: ¿de qué se trata esta nueva trilogía de Star Wars? Porque la Trilogía Original se trataba, claramente, sobre la pelea entre una Rebelión sin recursos y un Imperio Galáctico enorme, y la relación entre un padre e hijo. Y aunque tiene varios detractores, al menos podemos decir que las precuelas tratan sobre la caída de una democracia, la manipulación política y de poder de un político, y la tragedia de un chico que tenía miedo de perderlo todo. ¿Pero las secuelas? Las secuelas se sienten dispersas, apelando a lo que ya había funcionado antes (Episodio 7), tratando de hacernos olvidar el pasado y yendo en contra de nuestras expectativas (Episodio 8), o intentando reunir elementos de todas las películas anteriores, como para crear un sancochado lleno de fan service (Episodio 9). Ahora más que nunca, me hubiese encantando que Lucasfilm tenga un plan bien construido para esta nueva trilogía. Felizmente, todos los elementos que funcionaron en los dos filmes anteriores siguen aquí, para deleitar al espectador. Daisy Ridley da su mejor actuación como Rey, convirtiéndola en una protagonista que está buscando su lugar en el mundo —si “Los últimos Jedi” la trataba como guerrera confundida, que recién se estaba convirtiendo en Jedi, “El ascenso de Skywalker” la presenta como alguien más fuerte y decidida, pero que se encuentra en medio de una crisis de identidad alucinante. El Poe de Oscar Isaac no tiene un arco tan definido como en el filme anterior, pero logra otorgarle el mismo carisma de siempre al personaje —sus interacciones con la Zorii Bliss de Keri Russell son satisfactorias; el Finn de John Boyega tiene más que hacer acá que en la cinta anterior (y su química con la Jannah de Naomi Ackie es más fuerte que la que compartía con la Rose de Kelly Marie Tran), y el Kylo Ren de Adam Driver sigue siendo un gran villano —lleno de conflictos internos, e inseguro. Sus interacciones con Rey —a través de la conexión introducida por Johnson en el Episodio 8, uno de los pocos recursos que “Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker” hereda de dicha cinta— siguen siendo de lo mejor que el filme tiene para ofrecer. Sin embargo, y por razones que no termino de entender, Abrams y Terrio decidieron introducir varios personajes nuevos, muchos de los cuales se sienten completamente innecesarios, o están, al menos, mal servidos por esta historia en particular. Richard E. Grant es un excelente actor, pero su rol como el Almirante Pryde muy fácilmente hubiese podido ser cumplido por el General Hux de Domnhall Gleeson, quien muy poco tiene que hacer acá. La Jannah de Naomi Ackie, adicionalmente, aparece de manera muy repentina, y sin mayores explicaciones, se convierte en parte importante de la Resistencia. Y hasta el rol del nuevo droide, D-O, hubiese podido ser cumplido por el gran R2-D2; digo, como para darle algo importante qué hacer en esta trilogía. Quien la pasa realmente bien es el C-3PO de Anthony Daniels. Tiene algunos de los mejores —y más graciosos— diálogos, y un rol muy importante que cumplir para ayudar a la Resistencia. Y por más que su presencia en esta película se sienta extraña y hasta forzada, las escenas protagonizadas por el Palpatine de Ian McDiarmid son algunas de las mejores, demostrando, una vez más, que se trata de uno de los mejores villanos de la historia del cine (el pobre Snoke de Andy Serkis no le llegaba ni a los talones). Vale la pena admitir que algunas de las revelaciones realizadas por dicho personaje son algo… curiosas… pero verlo nuevamente en pantalla resulta ser todo un deleite. De hecho, su presencia no es la única referencia que la cinta incluye a las ocho películas anteriores; deben mantener los ojos abiertos —y los oídos limpios— durante todo el filme para encontrar diversos Easter Eggs, tanto visuales como sonoros, de la Trilogía Original y de las Precuelas. Se nota que Abrams quería unir, al menos a través de ciertos detalles, a todas las entregas de la Saga. Desgraciadamente, algunas de las tendencias más hiperactivas del reconocido cineasta se hacen evidentes en “Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker”, lo cual convierte a la experiencia en general en algo verdaderamente abrumador. Los primeros veinte minutos de la película se mueven a un ritmo extremadamente acelerado, confundiendo hasta al fanático más acérrimo, introduciendo nuevos conceptos y misiones y objetivos como si no hubiese un mañana. De hecho, se podría argumentar que todo el primer tercio del film es así, dependiendo mucho de artefactos que hay que encontrar, y personajes aparentemente importantes que nunca habíamos visto antes. Felizmente, para la mitad de la cinta Abrams se calma, entregándonos algunos momentos tranquilos, muchos de ellos protagonizados por la General Leia de Carrie Fisher quien, contra todo pronóstico, es despedida de manera respetuosa y extremadamente emotiva. Y el clímax de la cinta, aunque previsiblemente bombástico, pasa de lo visualmente espectacular e intenso, a lo innegablemente emotivo. Se puede debatir por años sobre lo “necesaria” que haya podido ser esta nueva trilogía, o sobre lo caótica y frenética que se puede sentir esta última entrega por momentos. Se puede escribir bastante sobre las incoherencias entre cada una de las tres películas, y sobre como fue necesario traer de vuelta a Palpatine luego de que el villano principal fue asesinado —sin mayor pompa o circunstancia— en el Episodio 8. Pero al final del día, “Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker” es lo que tenemos, y es el desenlace que se le ha dado a la Saga. Considerando el trabajo poco envidiable que tenía Abrams, entonces, no puedo decir que haya hecho un terrible trabajo. ¿Pudo ser mejor el Episodio 9? Sí. ¿Depende demasiado de la nostalgia y las referencias a filmes previos? Así es. ¿Se siente como cinco películas en una, llena de giros repentinos y personajes que sobran? Definitivamente. Pero también es una cinta con secuencias de acción emocionantes, excelentes actuaciones, personajes memorables, y despedidas y momentos finales extremadamente emotivos. En pocas palabras: en una película que dividirá al público. Y a estas alturas del partido, a ningún fanático de “Star Wars” le debería sorprender eso. La película final es una decepción total. Disney solo quiere ganar dinero con esta mudanza. Y con todos los personajes. Todos los nuevos robots se producen para ser vendidos como mercadería.",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," J.J. Abrams produced three of the biggest blockbusters in screen history, and with “The Rise of Skywalker,” directed two of them. But deja vu, corporate demands for characters, living and mechanical, suitable for toy shelves and his own intimidation by the scale of it all produced the two worst movies on Abrams’ action-packed resume. As somebody who has been pounding these films as unoriginal “glib facsimiles” of the “New Hope” trilogy, at first as a lone voice, eventually joined by a growing chorus of others, I’ve taken no pleasure in that complaining, and not much more in the movies. The endless pandering, “fan service,” reviving favorite characters for a final bow, bringing back beloved bits of tech, means “Skywalker” will make another mint. But those simple happy patrons loudly proclaiming “critics are IDIOTS” as they blissfully exited the opening night showing I caught have some explaining to do. You’re not under the illusion that the plot Abrams concocted to confine this trilogy to was anything fresh or surprising, that casting blunders at the outset haven’t grown more obvious with each film, right? Tell me you didn’t see a mid-space rescue mission straight out of “A New Hope” coming. Darth Vader choked and tossed around a member of the Empire’s Joint Chiefs of Staff once upon a time. Kylo Ren does it here. The villainous Sith are revived, the monstrous Emperor returns to venomous life — soap opera style. “The Force” isn’t the only thing that “will be with you, always.” It’s all a rehashing. Because, hell, they couldn’t come up with anything better and were afraid to try out anything new that wasn’t a Jetski on tracks on sand, a trimaran to pound through alien seas or a droid (D.O.) that Amazon couldn’t deliver by Christmas. Let’s introduce another badass bounty hunter type, cast Keri Russell in form-fitting jumpsuit, give her a past with the rakish space pirate Poe (Oscar Isaac), and keep her damned helmet on for the entire movie. Deaths that aren’t really deaths, light saber duels showcasing the growing supernatural skills of the young Jedi? A desperate, pull-out-all-the-stops final battle? Exactly the same action beats that Lucas introduced over 40 years ago. The story here drags everybody off the laurels they were resting on, because the hapless Vader Lite Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been lured into teaming up with a supposedly dead blast from the past, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDirmid).  “The First Order” of the Sith didn’t work out. Let’s gather “The Final Order” together and pose them for some cowled Blue Oyster Cult album cover scenes. Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her pals Chewie, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe and droids must figure out where the voice of Palpatine is coming from, a “hidden world of the Sith” where he’s been amassing hardware as the Empire has set out to “harvest more of the galaxy’s young” to fill those storm trooper ranks. Rey figures out, from Luke Skywalker’s old treasure map, that there are these magical compasses straight out of Hogwarts that will guide them to the planet X-Egul. They take on a quest just to set up another quest that will eventually get us to the Big Space Battle. Three films in, and Ridley has mastered the fierce scowl and “stick the landing” poses of a superhero movie. She has not, in any sense, created a character who moves us with her expressions of fear or grief. Every time somebody she cares about dies, it’s dry tears all around. Driver is going to get an Oscar nomination for “Marriage Story” and never look back on these movies (he hates looking at his performances) ever again. He has reason. He’d have been better served playing Kylo in a helmet the entire time. His facial expressions trying to capture the character’s conflicted nature, with even his flashes of temper looking like he’s about to cry, are risible here — laughably off. The casting issues aren’t limited to the poor actress Boyega, playing the ex-storm trooper who cries (Finn), threw under the bus in interviews about the end of the trilogy. Boyega is adequate, no more, in the action scenes, and he and Isaac (as smuggler/rogue/substitute Han Solo, Poe) have a sparkle to their bro-banter. The high-mileage “original stars” fare little better, although Billy Dee Williams still twinkles with charisma. Digitally reanimated Carrie Fisher is a drab, unemotional shell of the real thing, and Mark Hamill literally shrinks in his Wise Old Dead Jedi robes in scenes where he’s advising his protege. A clue as to where all this went wrong, where the stumbling began, might be in Anthony Daniels’ new book,”I Am C-3PO.” J.J. Abrams wrote the preface to it, and he reiterates his connection, as a 10 year-old, to “Star Wars.” When I interviewed him for “Star Trek” he declared he’d never paid the TV show any mind in reruns and wasn’t invested in it in the least. Perhaps, with all the Disney memos and marketing meetings and focus-grouping, he was just too close to “Star Wars” to give it an arm’s length look and the shot in the arm that it needed. Perhaps TV, where “Baby Yoda” rules “The Mandalorian,” is where this never-ending story really belongs. Cast: Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Keri Russell, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Mark Hamill,Ian McDermid, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant and Anthony Daniels. From your point of view, is there anything in this Star Wars movie that makes it a time capsule of 2018-2019? Each movie has something about it that captures the time when it was made. “The Last Jedi” had mansplaining, the struggle to cut ties with the past for self preservation, a stab at the character of the illegal immigrant, and a bunch of other twisted things in the mix. This one might represent the relentlessly hungry engine of capitalism on the clock pushing something to ultimately suck. Muahaha. Interesting point to break down. I liked the messaging, “They win if you think you’re alone,” which is very RESIST American and global nationalism/tribalism oriented. That’s on a par with the “Lord of the Rings” “evil in the world” line. Everything else is just recycled “Star Wars” themes about teamwork, cooperation, “family” — “Star Trek/Pixar” level stuff.  Yes. That’s it. The character Zorri Bliss says it first maybe: “They win by making you think you’re alone.” It’s repeated by Poe at the start of the final act or the “gathering the team” part within. I read some nerd complaining this movie has no structure, but that isn’t really true. It does have structure. On first viewing it might not feel like it. Zorri Bliss is the embodiment of something maybe “Me Too” or the Instagram exhibitionist. That one-wheeled droid who says, “No thank you, no please” when people reach out to touch I feel represents the year of abuse. This movie drives at such a break neck pace it’s difficult to take in the information overload. I can’t believe there’s a novelization of this also. Reflecting on the sentences would probably cause you to murder yourself. “Then BB-8 let out a series of boops and beeps, and all was understood.” Boing.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," Joe Friar is a member of the Critics Choice Association (Los Angeles) and the Houston Film Critics Society. A lifelong fan of cinema, he co-founded the Victoria Film Society, Frels Fright Fest, and is a Rotten Tomatoes approved critic.  As I sat in a movie theater watching “The Rise of Skywalker,” I was reminded of my youth when at the age of 13 I discovered the world George Lucas created with 1977’s “Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope.” I never imagined that in my 50s, I would still be experiencing new adventures in the same universe with Luke, Leia, Han and Chewy. This ninth installment of the franchise is meant to bring closure as the Skywalker saga comes to an end, while new chapters and stories unfold on Disney+ (no, Baby Yoda is not in this movie). J.J. Abrams and writer Chris Terrio come full circle to where it all began with many references back to “A New Hope” and an ending meant to leave fans teary-eyed. Yes, it’s great seeing Billy Dee Williams reprise his role as Lando Calrissian, who looks terrific without any Scorsese fountain-of-youth digital sorcery, and hearing C-3PO recite his “human-cyborg relations” line is sentimental, but for all the light saber duels and the appearances of past familiar characters, “The Rise of Skywalker” coasts along without provocation as it keeps its eye on the prize, tying up loose ends and giving fans one last chance to say goodbye. The film opens with the familiar John Williams theme and the yellow-lettered opening crawl that begins with “The dead speak!” as the synopsis explains that original Star Wars baddie Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has somehow returned with a new army called The Final Order. It’s great to see and hear 75-year old McDiarmid return as the vile Sith Lord who we all thought met his fate in “Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi.” As for the “how’s?” and “why’s?” I will leave that for you to discover as I try to keep this review spoiler-free. This latest trilogy which began with 2015’s “The Force Awakens” was meant to bid farewell to the original characters and introduce us to the next generation in the Skywalker saga. Daisy Ridley is back as scavenger Rey, who continues to train as a Jedi while brooding villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) maintains his plan to convert her to the Dark Side. The rebellious ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is still the strongest hope for the resistance, while former stormtrooper-turned resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) grows closer to Rey. The late Carrie Fisher returns as resistance leader General Leia, thanks to scenes shot by Abrams for “The Force Awakens” and tricky effects, while other characters like the newly introduced Rose Tico played by Kelly Marie Tran is unfortunately reduced to a handful of insignificant lines after receiving blowback from haters who didn’t like her in “The Last Jedi.” And speaking of Rain Johnson’s “The Last Jedi,” the film which many believed to be on the same level as “The Empire Strikes Back,” it looks like Abrams has discounted the creativity and freshness Johnson brought to the franchise by disregarding elements of that film and moving forward without any need for explanation. Some die-hard fans disapproved of “The Last Jedi” because it didn’t follow the expected formula of all the other Star Wars films and so Abrams seems to pander to the group by playing it safe and steering the canon back on a pre-Johnson course. The special effects in “The Rise of Skywalker” are fantastic, including a lightsaber duel between Rey and Kylo Ren on the wreckage of a familiar landmark as enormous waves of water loom in the background. Even with the return of Palpatine, the film is focused on Ridley and Driver as they struggle internally in a good vs. evil tug of war. The new elements in the film, stormtroopers that fly, Sith knives with inscriptions, a couple of new characters, and Rey’s evolving new Jedi powers are fun to watch, but let’s face it, we’re here to say goodbye and so every throwback and old familiar face is welcomed with open arms. It doesn’t end with a whimper, but it also doesn’t leave you wanting more. I left the theater filled with gratitude to George Lucas for these memorable stories and comfortable that it was all coming to an end.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Four years ago, when J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens broke box office records, all it truly had to do was recapture the general grandeur of Star Wars for a new audience without pissing off the old one too much. Two years later, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi furthered the first aim, but failed spectacularly at the second, splitting audiences virulently along opposing lines about the film’s controversial creative direction. Now, Abrams returns (taking Colin Trevorrow’s place) to right the ship and pray for a smooth landing for this nine-film, decades-spanning epic. The results, however, are beside the point. Whether or not The Rise of Skywalker is actually a good movie feels like a less important argument than understanding what the metric for that classification even is anymore. In the years Star Wars was dormant, the Expanded Universe of comics, books and video game tie-ins extrapolated the world of George Lucas’ first trilogy into a varied, lush breeding ground for genre exploration. In that time, fans took the childlike wonder they felt at the first films and imbued it into new stories, exhaustively filling in the blanks of every space not explicitly explained by Lucas and his collaborators. But this mindset clashes irrevocably with the way Disney has gone about making Star Wars films since purchasing Lucasfilm in 2012. The studio is great at weaponizing nostalgia, obviously, but with the Marvel brand, Kevin Feige has 50 years of established stories from which to adapt new films. With Star Wars, they’re starting from scratch and have largely been flying blind. It means that the heights of the new trilogy and the standalone films are higher than some of the MCU’s homogeneity, but when things don’t land, they crash hard. The Last Jedi’s approach left many dissatisfied, and for its part, Abrams and cowriter Chris Terrio attempt to course-correct those major elements. If people were frustrated that the film’s three leads, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) spent too much time apart, here they are together. Constantly. Displaying an unearned kind of camaraderie that only works off the strengths of its performers. Johnson wrote too many plot threads that ultimately weren’t essential to the completion of the narrative? Here, Abrams and Terrio have densely plotted their sequel with multiple MacGuffins and extreme fetch-quest mechanics so every scene feels necessary. The downside to that is every few scenes feel identical, with our heroes going from Stars Wars Planet to Star Wars Planet to interchangeable First Order ship. Abrams’ approach, once again, is to recapture what feels like Star Wars more than it is to create a compelling story on its own. The action is less legible than in the last outing, and none of the set pieces have the same verve as TLJ, but that’s not to say the characters we’ve come to enjoy aren’t pleasant to spend time with, or that the grandeur alone isn’t enough to hold the average viewer’s attention. But nothing here feels daring. The actual logistics of bringing Ian McDiarmid’s Palpatine back as the main villain are completely hand-waved and pushed so hard that they have to be accepted, even if neither of the two films that precede this one so much as seeded his return. Thankfully, his performance is still suitably horrific and the set pieces that prominently feature his presence do have a unique vibe, even if the entire third act built around him gives off heavy The Matrix Revolutions energy. Rose Tico, the character Kelly Marie Tran brought to such vivid life in the last film, is relegated to background status, getting roughly the same screen time as Greg Grunberg’s Snap Wexley and an unnamed Rebel played by Dominic Monaghan. (Also, this is the nitpick of all nitpicks, but Disney told Carrie Fisher to lose weight to come back as Leia in the last two films, but fucking Greg Grunberg’s chunky ass gets this oversized cameo piece with no body shaming attached?) Speaking of Carrie Fisher, Leia is still in this movie, despite Fisher’s untimely death. Her major spotlight was deferred to the third film to give Han and Luke their epic conclusions in the other two films, so her expected presence here is cobbled together from outtakes and unused footage in a way that would be clever if it meant anything at all. The work done to keep her around in the plot long enough to “sort of” matter stretches the upper limits of movie magic. This brings us to the real issue with The Rise of Skywalker. It feels like a patchwork quilt. It’s nearly impossible to feel immersed in the world when the puppet master’s hands are so visible, and the strings haven’t been hidden from view. This is a movie made purely from damage control and trying to sew up a giant tapestry of film, the last few chapters of which were, by design, not connected or in proper communication with one another. Even the kind of viewer who doesn’t spend all their time arguing about movies on Twitter and reading articles on the Playlist will have a sense of the backstage turmoil in these productions, and that’s a major failing. Disney+ has proven to us all with “The Mandalorian” that the majority of Star Wars fans really just need intermittent dopamine hits of their specific nostalgia flavor to numb the pain of living in modern capitalist society. The Skywalker saga coming to a semi-satisfying end means Disney can move on with the real work now, picking the bones of whatever ephemera we comfortably identify as being “Star Wars” and repackaging it carefully so as to 1) sell Funko Pops and 2) try not to piss off anybody. 
“ . . . Numb the pain of living in a capitalist society”?  Where did that COME FROM?  You lost me lamenting the relative invisibility of “Rose Tico” who was PC-shoehorned in from the second she was ever imagined, but without “the pain of living in a capitalist society”, Star Wars movies (or a job telling people if they’re good or not) wouldn’t exist . . .   Politics poisons everything.  It’s sad too because you used a few 10 dollar words I don’t see every day.

"Dec 20, 2019"," After 42 years of captivating audiences the world over, the story of the Skywalker family that began in 1977 comes to a close. While Disney‘s investment in Star Wars will most assuredly result in more Star Wars films, television shows, and books for years to come, that tale that evoked legends of old, all within intergalactic trappings that pushed the mediums of special effects and their usage in blockbuster film-making, finds finality within The Rise of Skywalker. The culmination of the “sequel trilogy” following 2015’s The Force Awakens and 2017’s The Last Jedi, it arrives following some unthinkable situations in the history of the franchise. The aforementioned The Last Jedi won over critics but has faced an unprecedented amount of critique and outright disgust from viewers in the last two years, and 2018’s Solo: A Star Wars Story performed well below company expectations after its costly budget and significant production problems. Pair this all with the runaway success of the first live-action Star Wars television series, The Mandalorian, and it’s easy to see that all eyes are on The Rise of Skywalker, not only because of its significance in cinematic storytelling, but also as a lightning rod for how Star Wars will develop in the future. J.J. Abrams, returning to direct after beginning this trilogy with The Force Awakens, came on-board a project that had lost its original director, Colin Trevorrow, and one of its stars, the late Carrie Fisher, who died almost a year before The Last Jedi released. The fact he came back on as director here is commendable, because the difficulties of this production can’t be overstated. Tying together three films, let alone nine, would be difficult even without those issues. Layer on to this the extremely divided state of the fan base, and the odds against it all seem greater than even the ones faced by the Resistance in the films.  That said, I think he fully succeeded as well as he could at completing what was began here. Is the film crammed (too) full of action and exposition? Probably, but when The Last Jedi diverged in so many unexpected ways and resolved most of the plot lines at its end, it left this film with having to establish conflicts, big and small, and a narrative impetus that would have usually been a carryover within any other third film and concluding chapter. That’s a lot of heavy lifting to do for any film, and this one did it without even the longest run-time for a Star Wars film. I will completely leave out the plot in discussion, because, as I said, so much of what we get here begins and ends within this film. Recounting it could spoil too much, and honestly, taking in all the trailers did that too well. There are several emotional beats in the film that didn’t land, all because I knew what I had witnessed in trailers that promised more beyond those moments. The less said, the better, as this film does draw back throughout the franchise and even beyond the films in various ways. Granted, most of this amounts to fan-service and Easter Eggs, both visual and audible, so if one has a deep affinity for the franchise, it’s all here for you, and the filmmakers go all out. Honestly, cumulatively, this all accounts for the best part of it all. The entirety is a far better experience than a cohesive film. That isn’t backhanded criticism, as much as it is hopefully a calibration of expectation. “Space Opera” was always George Lucas’ intent with Star Wars, and honestly, that has never been more true than here, a decades-long crescendo of story coalescence. The action set-pieces are massive in scale, and, yes, they attempt things we haven’t seen in Star Wars before. Beyond that, though, the most impressive thing is how Carrie Fisher was fully integrated into this film, even after her passing. Obviously, dialogue and plotting had to be devised around her absence on set, but I wasn’t prepared for more than a prolonged cameo. Here, she comes back to life for us all to enjoy Leia one last time. That devotion to the challenge of her realizing her character really bowled me over; as a fan, I have tremendous respect for all involved and deep appreciation for her daughter, Billie Lourd, in allowing it all to be done to the extent that it is. There are so many touching moments in this film, and yes, the pacing may take away from them, but I felt this film throughout, which is actually a narrative motif as well. Feeling typifies the strength of it all. While the humor has been a source of contention in this series of films, I would say that this film is the most successful of the three in its consistency. That is largely due to us finally getting to see our core group of heroes be just that: a group. That humor and drama may consist primarily of quipping and griping, but in hindsight, I do wish we could have saw them all together more in previous films. That camaraderie is a huge strength in this film, and it made me care more about everything (even if most everyone in said group is loaded with plot armor and precision aim). That is truly saying something as the film rockets ahead at a break-neck pace. Content-wise, there was some occasional language (not uncommon in all the films in sparring usage), and the dark imagery is higher than most entries in the series. Much of it may prove downright scary to children, but remember kids: confronting fear is the destiny of the Jedi. There were several prominent themes (that are very spoilery) that will surely make for great spiritual discussions; I can see this film being used for quite a few looks at destiny in the lives of individuals and how one can affect their own, and I can’t wait to talk about this film with those I know. All-in-all, I commend J.J. Abrams for largely sticking the landing here. While The Last Jedi was undeniably made to buck convention and appealed more to the standards of film critique, this film, for better or worse, does its best to appeal to what fans love about the franchise as a whole. While it may seem unfair, I rate this film more as an experience than a film, because that is truly what it is. I enjoy Star Wars, across its various media forms, and this serves as a culmination of so much of that, as it largely succeeds in integrating everything into an even broader canvas than within the lifetime of Darth Vader. Just as the heft of the Millennium Falcon is swiftly fit into impossible spaces in the film, the nigh-impossible task of trying to please (most) everybody is navigated with finesse amidst the bombast of a fitting conclusion. So much of this film put a smile on my face, and I immediately wanted to watch it all again. The cottage industry of online Star Wars criticism (which I regularly and thoroughly consume myself) will have varying opinions of the film of every degree, surely, and that shouldn’t surprise anyone who lived first hand through the prequels. Still, I don’t see the cultural force of Star Wars fading away anytime soon, and if anything, this film serves as a visceral celebration of what came before it and a reminder of what drew us all to love it in the first place.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019"," ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is like a ride in the Millennium Falcon: Rickety, often misguided and often seeming like it's about to fall apart at any moment. But the sucker sure does move fast and keep things exciting. Director J.J. Abrams had quite a bit to tie together, settle, rationalize and/or dismiss with the conclusion to the latest ""Star Wars"" trilogy, which itself is a trilogy of trilogies. It would be asking far too much to have everything make sense, and Abrams and company hardly try.  Instead of aspiring to straighten out the tangled web of plotlines, character lineages and motivations, Abrams opts to figuratively shoot the lights out. His film goes for big action set pieces, walloping emotional moments and gut-punching twists. The plot of the new film is about as rational -- as well as disarmingly exuberant -- as a 7-year-old pulling out a lunchbox full of ""Star Wars"" toys and pairing them together in whatever order he feels, concocting reasons on the fly to have this or that group get involved in whatever misadventure summoned by whim. Seemingly dead characters from the past jump back into the mix with minimal explanation. At times, ""The Rise of Skywalker"" plays like a best-of highlight reel of the last four decades and change of adventures in an increasingly wacky galaxy far, far away. As with most ""Star Wars"" movies, there aren't so much performances from actors as there are characterizations. Taking on beloved tropes, the characters spit out convenient one-liners, corny attempts at catch-phrases and grandstanding, power-play gestures. If there's a particular standoff or battle you've always craved in the ""Star Wars"" franchise, odds are you'll see it here. If there's a beloved group of characters from past movies that you miss, there's a great chance you'll catch another glimpse of them. Fan service is front and center, and the film is all the better off for it.  Those who have done their darndest to go into the movie spoiler-free will get the most out of ""The Rise of Skywalker,""  which packs a few stunning revelations that make all the more impact if they catch you off-guard. For me, there was about a twist and a half too many. The final line of spoken dialogue had me wincing, but the hokey finale didn't dampen my appreciation of the film, or the most recent trilogy as a whole.  The beauty of ""Star Wars"" is it gives even like-minded fans plenty to bicker and debate about. This movie will have its detractors, but my sneaking suspicion is that even those who say they hate it will walk away happy with the new bits and pieces of lore that the film has given them to chew on.  If you don't find something in this movie to enjoy, you probably just can't appreciate the silly sense of exuberance that ""Star Wars"" delivers to so many others.",POSITIVE

"Dec 20, 2019","Abrams and company is sloppily pulling strings to reach their safe conclusion of sacrifice, faith, and convenience. It admittedly works regardless of whether it resonates.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 20, 2019"," There is nothing more important than an ending. Great endings are genuinely profound. “The Godfather Part II”, “The Usual Suspects”, “Heat”, “Moonlight” and even one of the sixteen endings of “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” (the bit where the  Hobbits finally get to enjoy a cheeky beer together). Each of these reverberates at a frequency that synthesises everything that the movie or the series is ultimately about. I detested J.J Abrams’ “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” (TROS). It’s a shell of a film, more machine now than ever. A twisted wreck of fan service, messy assembly of conveniences, lazy echoes and callbacks crashing into an aborted conclusion.  The First Order, under the ferocious leadership of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), has delayed their extermination of the final sparks of the Resistance to pursue a broadcast claiming that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is alive and well. When Ren discovers the reincarnated Sith Lord and his behind the scenes manipulations, he joins forces to unite the power-hungry oppressive remnants of the Empire to unleash the “Last Order” or their remaining opposition. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is training under the supervision of General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher – RIP) when a spy within the First Order confirms Palpatine’s return. Not only is he back, but he’s been preparing an unstoppable fleet to give the entire galaxy an ultimatum; surrender to his rule or to die. With the help of Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), Rey must find a ‘wayfinder’ (essentially Sith GPS) to confront the Sith Lord and fulfil her destiny.  In amongst the ferocity of the discourse of “The Last Jedi,” are very valid criticisms. Perhaps Luke’s (Mark Hamill) ‘troll’ like petulance and fishing expedition ephemera could have been trimmed. His introduction could have been more sombre, waiting for incisive wisdom and training – mirroring his experience with Master Yoda in ‘Empire’. Perhaps Holdo (Laura Dern) could have been more clear with Poe (Isaac) that she had a plan for the Resistance and that he’d lost the privilege to hear it. Perhaps the trip to Canto Bight could have been better contextualised as the haven for those galactic war profiteers earlier and with less monster mash and flash. Evidently, for those of us who accept ‘The Last Jedi’ as a ‘flawed’ masterpiece, it’s the conclusion that rewards the story’s ambition.  The reason I bother mentioning any of this is to say that as I was watching TROS, I was undergoing an internal hostage negotiation. Question after question, even during the opening crawl, I was talking myself down to see if the end would justify the increasingly mystifying means. As a viewer, I’m less wedded to plot details than mood, feeling, texture, character, music, aesthetic choices. Yet I found myself flooded with a litany of what I deemed to be necessary details absent from the movie. Don’t worry, someone from Disney will point out that if I had read twenty-seven companion comics, three novelisations and subscribe to a weekly newsletter – it will fill in the gaps.  But who has that kind of time? The pacing of the film is blistering as it sets its scene and for once that’s not a good thing. In the opening crawl of the film, we learn that Palpatine is back, broadcasting like Happy Harry Hardon from an undisclosed Galactic location. In literally minute one, Kylo Ren is face to face with the titanic arch-villain of the series – this time with zombified eyes and an “Itchy and Scratchy” escalation level fleet of planet-killing star destroyers poised to strike at his command. How did he return? How was he found? How did he maintain secrecy assembling the most extensive fleet ever? Where did he get the resources to assemble this fleet? How did they develop this ultimate weaponry in complete isolation and secret? Who is operating the ships? Was Snoke, in fact, a Palpatine clone? Don’t worry in another 2 hours and 15 minutes won’t we surely see the tangle of new and remaining threads braided into a somewhat satisfying conclusion?  To quote “Solo” director Ron Howard from another franchise: “We don’t”. The existing suite of introduced characters wallow from barkeep turned freedom fighter Maz (voiced by Lupita Nyongo) who is nothing but a chorus, to Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose who is effectively abandoned. Rey’s heritage, a point of contention and debate since the inception of the sequel trilogy, is key to the conclusion of the story here. Trouble is, it’s a damned showstopper of epic stupidity. It’s not only a betrayal to Rey, but it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the characters that it purports are essential to the entire saga. The fate of Kylo Ren/Ben Solo – the mesmerising Adam Driver – has been intrinsically connected to the quality of the sequel trilogy. For all the promise of the character and the construction of perhaps the most moving moments of the entire series that play out in this film, he and the whole Skywalker/Solo family’s sacrifices are for naught.  His ambivalence weighed too heavily on writers Terrio and Abrams and their kit bag of bad story ideas leftover from Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow.  The publicity train of actors told us repeatedly how great it has been to have all of their characters together. However, when the group is is together; the task at hand is clear. Each new hurdle on the way to the climax feels like another series of mounting distractions, character introductions, and of course, toy introductions. When we find Lando, the legendary Billy Dee Williams, he looks as comfortable as Ben Affleck dressing as Batman at his kid’s daytime birthday party. Lando, we’re lead to believe, has been hanging on one of our stopover planets since he and Luke had followed a Sith agent there. Why is Lando still there? How, with all of Luke’s tremendous power and mastery of the Force, could he not get his hands on it? Why hadn’t he already answered the call to distress at the end of ‘The Last Jedi’? Sorry, it’s hard to curb the impulse to interrogate. I’ll refrain from going into more details here, but sufficed to say; it’s nigh impossible to go to the depths of what’s wrong with the movie without spoilers.  Are there moments to salvage? A few. Visually there are some superb shots, a lot of which, you’ve seen in the trailers. There’s a wondrous Kylo and Rey showdown as towering waves lash at the husk of the crashed second Death Star. The trailer teased Rey acrobatically dismantling a tie-fighter with a lightsaber – that scene is glorious.  Ridley and Driver are the performances of the film once again. Their interplay and the telepathic connection is back in full swing and evolving to allow them to tussle across vast distances. Ren’s obsession with Rey hasn’t diminished; in fact, the emergence of the Emperor has only strengthened his resolve to turn her to the dark side of the Force.  Desire, attraction, obsession; this is by far the most exciting relationship in the series – and remember – a sister french kissed her brother in ‘Empire’. The chemistry between Boyega and Isaac as Finn and Poe is delightful yet squandered. There’s also one soaring gleeful moment of flirtation between Poe (Isaac) and Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), but it’s too little and too late.  “Star Wars,” like so many people, is where my love for movies began, bloomed and blossomed. But to paraphrase one of the greatest films ever made and the most legendary characters ever conceived and performed; “Kids, I’ve flown from one side of this Star Wars galaxy to the other. I’ve seen a lot of strange and wonderful stuff, but I’ve never seen anything to make me stop believing that there’s one all-powerful Force controlling everything, until now.” TROS takes my magic and gives me midichlorians.  Less than 24 hours ago the voice of a Princess, the sound of a laser sword, a droid’s whistle, a whining roar of walking shag carpet, even a Corellian piece of space junk; could move me to tears. After TROS, they’re all just tricks and nostalgic drugs. Nothing about TROS makes me feel the need to revisit it. More than that, it’s stained my desire ever to go back to that galaxy far far away. I have the finale of “The Mandalorian” left, and for this critic – the saga and the universe ends.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019"," Quick review: A series of poor story and character decisions take away any emotional impact The Rise of Skywalker could have, which ends the Skywalker Saga on a sour note.  There’s something very off about The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth and final film in the Skywalker Saga. It feels at equal times too big and too small, too overwrought and too emotionless, too fast and too slow. The movie, more than any other blockbuster this year and in the franchise, feels completely contrived. Like it was stitched together from disparate arguing ideas and landed on all of them and none of them at the same time.  From the opening scroll, it’s already apparent that the movie is trying to do too much. I’ll spare you the specific plot details, but one I can reveal off the bat since it’s the first thing on the screen, is that Emporer Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is alive and planning to (surprise surprise) take over the entire galaxy with his massive fleet of star destroyers.  Through a breezy montage, a perfect demonstration of how the movie is too fast in some parts and too slow in others, we learn that Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has been looking for Palpatine to destroy any threat to his hold on the First Order. However, when he does find him, Palpatine promises him his entire fleet as long as Ren finds and kills Rey (Daisy Ridley). There, one plot thread set.  The second involves our new central trio of Rey, Fin (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), with the help of C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), BB-8, and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), chasing several items around the galaxy to find the hidden planet where Palpatine’s fleet is preparing to attack. A timeline of 16 hours is set, but unlike The Last Jedi, which made us feel the urgency of the time crunch, The Rise of Skywalker feels meandering.  The main problem is the script by director J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio. It spends so much time setting new story directions, redefining characters and their relationships, and squeezing in an overstuffed plot that it doesn’t spend time being effective at telling a coherent story.  There is more than one twist — some that should have truly been shocking — but the movie is never able to land them effectively because the build-up just isn’t there. Rian Johnson beautifully sets up the stakes for the third movie, but Abrams clearly wanted to go a different direction and instead wasted his time pulling emotion out of thin air.  If I sound overly critical it’s probably because I was really pulling for The Rise of Skywalker. I enjoy the Star Wars movies. I wanted to be satisfied at the end. But I couldn’t connect with anything. There’s a moment that should be as awe-inspiring as the Portals moment in Avengers: Endgame. Instead, it inspired a rolling groan from my audience. There was no build-up, no suspense, it just kind of happened. That’s the best way to describe the movie, it just happens. There’s nothing to experience and I want my star war to be an experience.

"Dec 20, 2019"," In 1977, theatre owners
everywhere were excited about an upcoming film from 20th Century Fox
that they were sure was going to fill their theatres for weeks. That film was “The Other Side
of Midnight.”  Based on a very popular
best-selling book, the demand for the film was so great that the studio was
able to do a little quid-pro-quo with the owners.  If you promise to play this little space movie
we have coming out in May we will make sure you get “The Other Side of
Midnight.”  That “little space movie”
was, of course, “Star Wars.”  The
punchline to this story is that “Star Wars” proved to be so popular that, when “The
Other Side of Midnight” opened two weeks later, many theatres NEVER played it
as they were still filling the house.  I’m
pretty sure I can guarantee that the final installment in the original series
will do the same. Let me begin by saying this
will be a spoiler-free review.  Not only
because the studio asked critics not to give anything away but also because if,
like me, you’ve got 40-plus years of your life invested in the saga you don’t
want some pencil neck with a computer spoiling your fun.  The story begins with our heroes Rey
(Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron  (Oscar Isaac) still trying to defeat the First
Order, led by Kylo Ren (Driver).  While
Rey continues her Jedi training, Kylo Ren is raging his way through the galaxy,
hoping to confront the all-powerful Emperor, the leader of the evil Sith.  Things are getting bleak for the resistance
and General Leia Organa (Fisher) is out of ideas.  Will the final pieces of the rebellion be
destroyed?  Sorry, the studio won’t let
me tell you! Here’s what I can tell
you.  Director J.J. Abrams, who co-wrote
the screenplay with Oscar-winning screenwriter Chris Terrio (“Argo) has crafted
a story that should satisfy every “Star Wars” fan in the galaxy.  Old friends return while new friends extend
the story.  You would have to have a
heart colder than a Wampa not to enjoy this movie. The cast is top-notch, with
the three principal actors having grown into their roles.  It is obvious they are much more comfortable
here than they were in Episode VII (“The Force Awakens”).  Rey is certainly my grandchildren’s version
of “Alien” crewmember Ellen Ripley, a strong, young woman that others can look
up to and admire.  Fisher’s Princess Leia
in the original trilogy was the same kind of character and Ms. Ridley gives her
both an outer and inner toughness, though the goodness she possesses is also
visible.  Both Boyega and Isaac have
larger roles here.  Finn is much more
decisive in his actions while it’s nice to see Poe NOT in a spaceship for the
majority of the film.  The filmmakers
were able to include Carrie Fisher in the story by reshaping scenes she filmed
for “The Force Awakens” and it is a joy to see her on the big screen one last
time. Driver has also grown into
the role.  To me he came off as a little
wimpy when he was introduced in “The Force Awakens” but here he is downright
terrifying.  The man has some serious
anger (and family) issues and you don’t want to be near him when he snaps.  To counter the intensity of some scenes
Abrams has also included some good, old fashioned humor and the jokes play
well. Visually, of course, the film
is a masterpiece.  Battles between
literally hundreds of ships take your breath away and the musical score, by the
great John Williams, is a perfect accompaniment to the action on screen. In the spring of 1977 some friends of mine and I wrote away to 20th Century Fox for some information on “Star Wars.”  We each received a beautiful full-color campaign book, which I still have.  I was 16 when “Star Wars” came out.  Like many people my friends and I went to the theatre not knowing what to expect and walked out hooked.  I enjoyed the films so much that half of my basement is crowded with “Star Wars” memorabilia.  I was even asked to moderate the 40th Anniversary Q&A event that was held in Kansas City.  “Star Wars” is, and has been, a very important and memorable part of my life and I must say that “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is the perfect ending to my childhood!",POSITIVE
"Dec 20, 2019","When we meet up with brash pilot Poe, he's lightspeed-skipping his way out of trouble, and Abrams is in much the same mode, whisking you from one thing to the next before you have much time to think or feel anything in response.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 20, 2019"," I have been looking forward to Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker for a very long time, and tonight, I finally saw it. Here is my The Rise of Skywalker review (spoiler free). All opinions expressed are 100% my own. I have been anxiously awaiting this movie — and when the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker first impressions started rolling in this week, I admit, I got a little nervous. The reviews were mixed. Then the Rotten Tomatoes reveal came and I was REALLY worried. Did I waste all these years as a Star Wars fan just to be disappointed by the end? Either way I was going to the theater opening night, and I was hoping to enjoy myself. Well, I did. I actually really did. There were twists and turns that I didn’t see coming — and a good amount of fan service toward the other films. Everything was wrapped up in a neat little bow.. sort of. And the last 30 minutes? Well the last 30 minutes are damn near pure perfection (even though I hated some of what happened). In a way this movie is about redemption. Not just for certain characters, but for the franchise. Many fans felt robbed the last movie, JJ Abrams did everything he could to give them what they wanted. What they deserved. From the very first scene of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker you are thrown in to action — and it seems to never end. The Resistance is, yet again, on a time crunch. So they have a lot to pack in over the next two and a half hours of movie. There is not one dull moment, but on the contrary, it doesn’t feel super rushed either. The first 20 minutes or so does get a little jumpy — going scene to scene — but that works itself out. It is well known that I am an emotional person. I just can’t help it. If you have seen my trailer reactions and movie reviews, then you know I cry a lot. So I was expecting to cry a few times during The Rise of Skywalker, but nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to experience. The final 30 minutes of the movie I was a sobbing mess. BOTH TIMES I saw it.  During the second showing I with my young daughters (6 & 8) and they were sobbing right along with me. These are characters some of us grew up with. For my girls, they met them a while ago but just recently got to know them as we binged all the movies prior to seeing this one. These characters mean a lot to us and we go through emotions with them. There is a LOT to unpack in this one. But it worth it. If you want the full, spoiler filled details check out my article: The Rise of Skywalker emotional moments. I can’t really mention any of them here because they are all very spoilery. I couldn’t write up a The Rise of Skywalker review without at least touching on the new characters. Of course, I was excited to see a few new characters — even though they weren’t in the movie as much as I would have liked them to be. But perhaps that was a good thing as the characters we already know had so much to do and to experience. These new characters served their purpose well, but didn’t convolute the story. My favorite of the new ones? Babu Frik. He had me cracking up. And he is so dang adorable. Zorri Bliss and her interactions with Poe had me cracking up. I loved their chemistry, and I would like to hear more about their backstory. Hmmm… perhaps that is something we could get in the future? Jannah was absolutely amazing and I just LOVED one major fact about her — that is sort of a spoiler so I will keep my mouth shut for now. But if you have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about. I will admit that I did not see that coming, and I am totally here for it. The scene where you find out just might be one of my favorite scenes in the movie. The new droid, D-O, is super adorable and provides a little character relief. I love how he and BB-8 became fast friends. And that he really helped out in the story. Perhaps we will learn more about him eventually as well?! As you probably know already, I am pretty lenient when it comes to movies for my kids. They are 6 and 8 and have seen all the Marvel movies — which can get pretty violent. Is The Rise of Skywalker violent? Of course. It is a Star Wars movie. Is it creepy? Of course. It is a Star Wars movie. Is it emotional? Yup. Sure is. But there is not really much bad language. So that is a plus. In fact, I barely noticed any language at all. I didn’t have a problem taking my girls to see it. And yes, technically I screened it first. However, I would have taken them opening night if it worked with their schedule (it didn’t). After seeing the movie with them, I am glad they experienced it in the theater. I plan to take them again over holiday break.  There is a good amount of fan service in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. What do I mean by that? There will be a lot of callbacks from previous films, a lot of nods to them, and some things that will likely make your heart swell as fan. One moment in particular toward the end REALLY got me. And during my second showing my husband even elbowed me to talk about it with a BIG smile on his face. Is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker a perfect movie? Of course not. But does it do justice to the franchise? Absolutely. For me, it is hands down the best of the trilogy. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had several mind blowing revelations that I did not see coming. It had action from beginning to end. And it made me cry. A lot.  Both audiences I saw it with clapped, cheered, cried, gasped, and yelled things out. That is something I needed to include in this The Rise of Skywalker review because I have seen a lot of hate online saying that no one will enjoy it. We are all allowed our own opinions, of course. But there are Star Wars fans out there that had a good time. That enjoyed being at a Star Wars movie. The last of the Skywalker Saga, in fact. And that needed to be said. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ties everything together in a neat little bow. It fixes past issues with the franchise, and should make a lot of Star Wars fans happy. At the absolute worst you will have a good time at the movies. The surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe Dameron’s journey continues. With the power and knowledge of generations behind them, the final battle commences. My theater had the following warning printed out and taped up on the doors: STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER contains several sequences with imagery and sustained flashing lights that may affect those who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or have other photosensitivities. Because of this I kept it in mind while watching, so I could warn others about it in my The Rise of Skywalker review. There are several scenes that this occurs. So if you or someone in your family has epilepsy, please be careful going to see this in the theater. Tessa Smith is a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer-approved Film and TV Critic.

"Dec 20, 2019"," The faults of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” are those of the franchise over all, distilled and magnified because the film’s director, J. J. Abrams, is mainly a distiller and a magnifier, and brings virtually no originality to it. His earnest and righteously grandiose direction evokes, as few movies do, a craving for Michael Bay at the controls. Since the prospect of a refined stylist such as Wes Anderson or Sofia Coppola—who’d likely chafe at the narrow limits imposed by such a franchise film—is too much to ask for, a boldly imaginative vulgarian such as Bay would be a welcome substitute. See the opening chase scene of Bay’s “6 Underground,” currently on Netflix, for a sense of what can be done with an emotionally stultified and dramatically trivial script. It’s not good, but it’s at least full of surprises and provides a baseline astonishment. It would be fascinating to see the colossally derisive wreckage that Bay could make of the rigidities and pieties of “Star Wars.” There are no such surprises, let alone audacities, in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” yet I confess that it’s nonetheless engaging to see how the movie’s ponderous banalities reveal the essence of the cycle’s four-decade slog. (I’ll do my best to describe it while avoiding spoilers, but beware nonetheless.) This installment also repudiates what’s best in Star Wars, namely the idiosyncrasies and complexities of George Lucas’s last two prequels, where he flaunted the purpose and the playfulness, the intricate political intrigue and the high-style flourishes, that he had sublimated in decades of cultivating industrial-strength success. Lucas sold the Star Wars franchise to Disney, in 2012; now whatever’s left of his world view has been mined and refined into narrow and simplistic norms. The dyad of Disney (with its sanitized and sanctimonious simplicities) and Abrams (with his scrawnily derivative sensibility, an echo of an echo) has become a Death Star. As for the story of “The Rise of Skywalker,” it’s centered on its two protagonists’ struggles with their civic duties and their personal identities. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is being trained by Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) to continue the Resistance, but she herself is pulled between her blood legacy and her allegiances—she learns that she is a granddaughter of the late Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who here makes a posthumous return as more than an illusion and less than flesh. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), a.k.a. Ben Solo—who has repudiated his father, Han Solo, and gone over to the dark side—gets an offer from Palpatine to take his place, together with Rey, and continue the reign of the Sith. The drama gathers members of the Resistance who survived the catastrophe of “The Last Jedi”: primarily, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), whom Leia designates as her successor; Finn (John Boyega), whom Poe names as his coequal; Chewbacca; and the droids BB-8 and C-3PO. These five, led by Rey, plan to pursue the revived Palpatine on the planet of Exegol, but they can’t find it without a gizmo known as a wayfinder, and they cannot get the wayfinder without deciphering an inscription that can’t be translated except, et cetera. The hermetic logic of the plot is as impeccable as it is ridiculous. It’s a drama crafted with robotic insularity for the consumption of viewers being rendered robotic at each moment of the soullessly uniform spectacle. The bulk of “The Rise of Skywalker” involves characters in closeup expelling greeting-card-like slogans with vehemence and dour conviction, punctuated by lumpishly unchoreographed biff-bash-and-blam fight scenes. Abrams doesn’t offer any original, significant, or memorable images, not a glimmer of action that’s staged with a sense even of mere physical connection, let alone balletic grace or athletic splendor. The closest thing to inspiration comes in the form of an occasional touch of design, in the gigantic shiny basalt blackness of Sith void spaces and the overwhelming waves separating Rey from the wreckage of the Death Star. Instead of drama and imagination, the movie depends on a relentless blare of music, by John Williams, which takes the place of any emotional complexity that might dare to sneak through the interstices. The movie’s few infinitesimal touches of what might be called character—such as Rey substituting compassion for violence when she heals a deadly serpent—tick off a few ready-made socio-boxes. There is a quick moment of feminine solidarity, a carefully focus-grouped lesbian kiss. What’s more, it’s dispiriting to see the differences in how Ridley and Driver are directed. Ridley is called upon to express and overexpress, at each given moment, one given emotion, while Driver underexpresses, suggesting competing emotions. This isn’t a judgment on the skills of the two actors but, rather, what they reflect in the Star Wars universe and its creative conception: there, women, however heroic, are simple, and men are complex. It’s a reminder that the director and the four credited writers of “The Rise of Skywalker” are all male—and that the entire franchise, including the past half decade’s trio of sequels, has had no female director (and only one female screenwriter, Leigh Brackett, on “The Empire Strikes Back,” from 1980). From the start, the series has exhibited a combination of grandiosity and cuteness, keeping its emotions in the narrow range between the irreproachable and the irresistible. “The Rise of Skywalker” amps up the cuteness factor with a new little creature, an impish one-wheeled stray droid with a conical head like that of the Pixar logo—as if recalling that franchise’s roots in Lucas’s stable. And one waits, in quiet terror, for the thudding delivery of the word that Steven Soderbergh has identified as Hollywood’s baseline weasel idea: “Hope.” There is a lot of hope, but, above all, it’s a movie that pushes the cycle’s own baseline idea, of family and return, to newly neurotic extremes. It’s a movie of grownups desperately tangled up in mommy and daddy issues a long time ago, before psychologists, artists, and even personality were invented. In this regard, the movie harks back to the roots of the cycle, to Lucas’s peculiar place as the neediest and most throwback modernist. The greatness of the film that Lucas made prior to “Star Wars,” “American Graffiti,” was its conjoined source as personal recollection and historical horror show. Lucas filmed a coming-of-age story that’s really a compulsive return to catastrophe and entropy, a nostalgia for calamitous loss and a desperate search for where it all went off the rails. The Star Wars cycle is the answer—a quest for the primal structure of society and family and identity that, in the process, would also gratify those in desperate need of such answers. Lucas’s vision was huge, his emotional range truncated. He created a mighty, faux-Wagnerian fantasy that offered the petty and sanctimonious palliatives of “Leave It to Beaver” in a vast mythology, uniting past and future. And he created immense, vast, inhuman, impersonal cinematic machinery to embody the tiny but mighty flame of his personal obsession. In the best films of the cycle, “Attack of the Clones” and, above all, “Revenge of the Sith,” Lucas commandeers that machine with the force of his own inner resistance. That flame has long been extinguished. The negative reviews that “The Rise of Skywalker” is getting seem to me like the reverberations of Martin Scorsese’s recent anti-franchise discourse—like a critical community doing public penance for its decades of fealty to imposters and fabrications and mercantile simulacra of art, a long-overdue recognition of the distinction between corporate content and personal creation. Despite the round of art-house verities that often get ballyhooed in their stead, this is a development that nonetheless fills one, dare I say it, with a new hope for the cinema.

"Dec 20, 2019"," Can this final Star Wars movie live up to the fevered anticipation? It’s a split decision. While delivering an action packed fantasy that fans demand, Director J.J. Abrams pulls a few punches. To placate stalwarts who gave Rian Johnson’s dark re-tooling of the storylines in The Last Jedi, Abrams brings back some original villains to test Rey (Daisy Ridley). Abrams has to provide some answers about family trees and political alliances without bogging down the pace. And Abrams keeps this one frantic.  The film begins with the epic full screen crawl getting the audience up to speed from the end of the last movie. Rey is getting ready for the final battle with the First Order. She’s training under the tutelage of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The late actresses lines were pulled from previously unused shots in The Force Awakens. Carrie Fisher is just the first of a parade of iconic Star Wars characters who walk across the screen as if taking nostalgic curtain calls. The three main heroes, Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac)  and the heavy Kilo Ren (Adam Driver) were introduced by Abrams in 2015’s The Force Awakens, so it’s fitting he gets to close these chapters. Boyega and Poe get a lot more screen time and their relationships are more fully developed.  The script by Abrams and Chris Terrio has so much ground to cover that the enterprise becomes a manic exercise trying to fit in plot points while stuffing the screen with hyper-battles, light speed space travel, and audio pounding explosions. The sky is filled with every kind of starfighter and , for the first time, stormtroopers fly through the air! Some even sport stylish red stormtrooper shells. Abrams throws in everything eye-catching device.  We have to learn Rey’s real origin story and lineage. What was Poe up to before he became a Resistance good-guy. And how does über-villain Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who supposedly was killed off back in 1983’s Return of the Jedi, get back in the game to rule the universe? With such a massive to-do list Abrams and Terrio simply leave holes in the story. It’s impossible to write about any one Star Wars movie in a vacuum. They all have to relate to the others. Where Rian Johnson gave a despondent persona to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and a Resistance that teeters on the brink, Abrams ignores most of those devices to make a Saturday matineé popcorn throwback to the past. He’s more concerned keeping the fan base happy than innovation. There are also underused characters we were hoping to see more on this  journey. Chief among them is Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) from The Last Jedi. She was a winning, charming presence that is relegated to a near extra-role here. Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), makes appearances, we think, because she is completely covered in her red space suit and helmet. You can’t even see her eyes! New to the Resistance is Jannah (Naomi Ackie) Both Zorii and Jannah come and go so fast it looks like they’re only introduced to be used in whatever next Star Wars movies are in development. Without giving away all the old faces who pop up, one who gets more than a moment is Lando Carlissian (Billy Dee Williams) back in the pilot seat with a lot of added closeups. All the droids are back too, and a new charmer, D-O, who reminds us a bit of Wall-E who will likely get more screen time down the road. Wish there had been this time so we could become more attached to this new character.  Even the battling machines have a nostalgic tenor. Rey and Kylo Ren engage in Light-Sabre battle on the destroyed hulk of the Death Star amid massive crashing surf. The CGI effect of battling the enormous  waves Rey has to traverse, while going at each other, rank among the best effects in the film. But that’s not all. Rey even takes to the sky in Luke’s original X-wing for aerial dogfights. Nice touch. Of course sound and fury are central elements to generate excitement and cheers from the audience. But what this film lacks are more gentle, quiet moments like when C-3PO takes a pause to look at the heroes surrounding him and says, “I’m just taking one last look at my friends.”  There aren’t many openings for touchy-feely moments like this in a movie that moves frantically like a video game on a quest to find a prize while hop-scotching across the galaxy. The music from John Williams not only strikes the same chords we’ve heard for generations and that’s as it should be. He also writes powerful new music to get your attention during the action scenes. But in a nod to present day composers, J.J. Abrams accepted the offer from his friend Lin-Manuel Miranda to write the music for what we’ll call the obligatory “cantina” scene. Does this final episode of the third trilogy put a proper bow on the franchise? George Lucas began Star Wars in 1977 because he couldn’t secure the rights to the hero he really wanted to bring to the screen, Flash Gordon. Now, with all the movies, TV (Mandelorian) and spin-offs, this franchise re-shaped entertainment culture with the dawning of these blockbuster events. Will you get final answers to the questions about the Skywalkers, Vaders and Palpatines? J.J. Abrams has competently brought this mythology about family, power, hope and love to a conclusion. But fear not, true fans, Disney is sure to find a new action adventure in a galaxy far, far away… and as close as the cineplex.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 20, 2019"," “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” has on its shoulders the hard task of concluding yet another trilogy in one of pop culture’s great sagas. Even more than the last two entries, this one feels made specifically for the “Star Wars” fan base, those devotees of the Force who debate this cinematic universe as fervently as other people discuss the news. Even at 2 hours and 22 minutes it can have the feeling of being cramped, with director J.J. Abrams rushing along to seal fates, give us long foreshadowed showdowns and bring back from the vaults of pop memory another favorite face from long ago. It is a grand entertainment for sure, even as we feel a scorecard is required and the uninitiated may feel lost in space.  You know how it begins, in a galaxy far, far away. As tends to be the case galactic rebels, in this case the Resistance, are running around space evading the evil forces of The First Order, now led by self-declared Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Leading the Resistance are Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Meanwhile Rey (Daisy Ridley) has been secluded and continuing her training in the ways of the Force, on her way we presume to become a Jedi knight. But she’s pulled back into action by Poe, as they prepare for a final showdown with the First Order. Yet a new, greater terror has arisen. The long-dreaded Sith have reemerged on a distant planet, led by a reanimated Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Palpatine’s aim (and you might want to write this down), is to lure Rey to his side and replace the First Order with his own The Final Order and revive the old Empire.  J.J. Abrams directs “The Rise of Skywalker” like a tunnel-vision handyman, never wishing to experiment beyond what’s expected in a “Star Wars” story. In a sense this is a response to 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” where director Rian Johnson continued the narrative established in Abrams’s first entry in this trilogy, 2015’s “The Force Awakens.”  While Abrams keeps the tone as a frenetic popcorn entertainment, Johnson had brought a visually awe-inspiring scope, self-aware humor and a more patient pace. The fanboys wouldn’t have it and the discrepancy between critical consensus and popular reception was large enough for Disney to bring in Abrams to make a by the numbers spectacle. The challenge is how to please the fan base while delivering simply a good movie.  For most of its running time “The Rise of Skywalker,” officially “Episode IX” in the whole roster, has little time to expand the story, what matters is the breakneck energy of the production. The screenplay by Abrams and Chris Terrio, who has penned other manic action fests like “Justice League” and “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,” quickly revives old “Star Wars” favorites like Emperor Palpatine, who you may recall was killed off by Darth Vader in 1983’s “Return of the Jedi” and even Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), still suave (“send Leia my love”). Lando is back to help the Resistance fight the First Order, he’s a bit hastily introduced during a desert festival where Poe, Rey and Chewbacca are roaming about as aliens in eastern garb emit friendly greetings while dancing. Yet it’s great fun to see him back for the purposes of nostalgia. Chewbacca actually does little in this movie except sit around, in the same way Finn (John Boyega) spends most of it running and shouting while being reduced to even more of a background character. Many of the plot details are basically old “Star Wars” elements updated. For example it turns out Palpatine has a fleet of Star Destroyers now all equipped with “planet destroying” lasers. So now they can all do what the Death Star used to accomplish by wiping out just one planet per movie. The Resistance has to again regroup to launch a massive, final assault to destroy this and other dangers posed by the Final Order (or is it the First Order?) to the galaxy. The beloved droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2D2 are back, doing their usual cute buddies routine. Inevitably C-3PO will have his memory wiped out, which makes him more of a nuisance, especially for Poe, this leads to some very likeable moments.  All this is piled atop the key focus of the narrative which is Rey’s continuing transformation from scavenger to rebel to Jedi knight, and her evolving clash with Kylo Ren. What in the previous two films was set up as a complex relationship is stripped down to a very basic premise. Ren, estranged son of Leia and Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who he killed off in “Force Awakens,” is tapped by Palpatine to become his new pupil. The only real change in Ren is that his Darth Vader-like helmet now has glowing red streaks. His chase of Rey results in an epic clash of lightsabers on top of old Death Star ruins amid crashing waves. It’s a wonderful set piece, though not as astounding as the lava planet duel from “Episode III: Revenge of the Sith” in those pre-Disney days. The plot gets a bit hazy as to certain changes that later occur involving Ren’s personality. Certain moments like a sudden appearance by Han have little explanation (don’t only Jedis make ghostly cameos? How does it work for those outside of their circle?). Ren almost makes the whole Palpatine storyline unnecessary. He was a strong enough villain on his own with serious complexes as played by Adam Driver, who is getting acclaim for his wonderfully keen performance in “Marriage Story” and brings gravitas even to shallow moments in this movie.  Yet, “The Rise of Skywalker” still delivers spectacular sights and moments that will delight those who dearly love this world originally created by George Lucas. Abrams uses unused footage of Carrie Fisher from “The Force Awakens” to have some final moments of Leia, and her eventual departure, while abrupt provides some needed closure to the character. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins the old Jedi pantheon that includes Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda where he’s now a walking, blueish entity giving Rey advice. Palpatine, played once again by Ian McDiarmid with that evil warlock voice, spends the movie sitting in a dark chamber and later levitates before a coliseum filled with anonymous, hooded devotees of the Sith. They don’t do anything for the rest of the movie, but it’s a memorably cultish sight. More adorable little creatures are introduced too, including a tiny engineer named Babu Frik who does some cross-wiring on C-3PO. More human characters are also thrown onto the roster like Jannah (Naomi Ackie), who like Finn is a former Storm Trooper who defected. There’s also a masked female smuggler with some kind of unspecified, flirty past with Poe. And of course the great John Williams returns with another symphonic score full of lush flourishes and beloved classic themes. Like many a third sequel, the last act of “The Rise of Skywalker” is a mad rush to close shop. A final showdown is combined with another gargantuan space battle. Surprisingly this is when it truly stops feeling like a classic “Star Wars” movie and more like another CGI fest of the sort we’ve become accustomed to. But Abrams eventually finds space to include a bit more real drama, including a kiss that is the film’s great shocker. The actual closing scene of the movie is Abrams’s best homage to the “Star Wars” legacy as well, shot with the kind of nostalgic pleasure missing from the more kinetic moments. After “The Rise of Skywalker” Disney is planning to slow down what began as a hurried production of “Star Wars” movies. There was a general mood that with last year’s poorly-received “Solo” maybe the studio was reaching the overkill zone. Taking a break after this one is a wise choice. It closes a saga in the franchise while pushing it to the limit of what the story can continue saying or do. But fans will find much to cheer in it, because for them what counts is the myth itself.",POSITIVE

Star Wars: A Ascensão Skywalker é o que acontece quando um artista cede sua voz aos discursos pré-aprovados de uma corporação, que, tentando não ofender nenhum espectador (“consumidor” seria uma palavra mais apropriada), insiste numa história criada por comitê e que busca dizer apenas aquilo que seus clientes querem ouvir. Neste sentido, J.J. Abrams é o sonho de todo executivo, uma aposta segura, já que é um realizador mais interessado em recriar do que em conceber algo próprio. Competente de um ponto de vista técnico (que é o que, no final, o diferencia de um Chris Columbus), o cineasta se mostra sempre mais confortável quando emulando estilos estabelecidos por outros (como em Super 8 e Cloverfield) ou continuando narrativas já estabelecidas (Missão: Impossível 3, Star Trek, O Despertar da Força) – e, não à toa, o melhor que consegue imaginar em um momento-chave de A Ascensão Skywalker é praticamente uma citação visual de Os Caçadores da Arca Perdida. Esta sua disposição de repintar desenhos feitos por artistas mais imaginativos é, claro, ideal para reboots – e, por mais eficiente que seja O Despertar da Força (e gosto muito do filme), é indiscutível que se trata mais de refilmagem do que de uma continuação, já que todas as batidas da história, arquétipos e elementos estilísticos vinham diretamente de Uma Nova Esperança. Comparar seu trabalho ao de um artista realmente inventivo como Rian Johnson, que possui voz própria e buscou usá-la em Os Últimos Jedi para descobrir novos ângulos de uma história recontada mil vezes, é um exercício de análise revelador – e não há, em toda a filmografia de Abrams, uma passagem que se equipare à da batalha na sala vermelha do trono de Snoke ou um plano como aquele em que a mão de Rey surge subitamente em quadro para segurar o sabre de luz que voa em direção à câmera. Por outro lado, por mais que tenha alcançado sucesso de crítica e bilheteria, o Episódio VIII desagradou uma parcela do fandom (palavra maldita) de Star Wars – ou por sua ambição temática e subtexto político-social ou por “não ser Star Wars de verdade”. Em outras palavras: fãs que queriam apenas uma nova dose da receita de sempre. Não deixa de ser apropriado, portanto, que as primeiras palavras do letreiro de abertura de A Ascensão Skywalker sejam “Os mortos falam!”, já que, no meio de seu pânico corporativo, a Disney, dona da franquia, basicamente decidiu ignorar a maior parte das brilhantes contribuições de Johnson e apostar no que considerava seguro, chegando ao ponto de reviver o vilão mais poderoso da saga (não é spoiler; está no trailer), o Senador Palpatine (McDiarmid) – mesmo que isto signifique, em retrospecto, diminuir o efeito do sacrifício feito por Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader ao fim de O Retorno de Jedi. Do mesmo modo, como os “fãs” reprovaram a jovem Rose Tico, que fez par com Finn (Boyega) no capítulo passado, aqui Abrams e seus patrões recompensam a toxicidade e os abusos que obrigaram a atriz Kelly Marie Tran a abandonar as redes sociais e rapidamente a rebaixam a uma quase figuração através de uma desculpa mal formulada (“Não posso ir com vocês; a General Leia quer que eu...” blá-blá-blá) – o que, considerando a proximidade entre os dois personagens ao final de O Despertar da Força, representa um tropeço gigantesco de um ponto de vista narrativo. Complicando sem necessidade uma história que poderia ser sintetizada em uma frase curta (“Rey busca uma ‘bússola Sith’ que a leve até Palpatine enquanto é tentada por Kylo Ren a passar para o lado sombrio da Força”), o roteiro escrito por Abrams e Chris Terrio (Batman vs Superman, Liga da Justiça – pois é) envia a protagonista (Ridley) e seus parceiros Finn e Poe (Isaac) para vários cantos da galáxia ao mesmo tempo que se esforça para costurar cenas com Carrie Fisher, morta precocemente em 2016, a partir de cenas descartadas de O Despertar da Força – o que resulta em trocas de diálogos desconjuntadas em que há praticamente um corte a cada fala, deixando o artifício ainda mais óbvio (e a julgar pela qualidade dos diálogos – “Nunca tenha medo de ser quem é” -, é fácil entender por que haviam sido eliminados originalmente). Enquanto isso, o retorno de Billy Dee Williams como Lando Calrissian pode ser eficiente como gatilho nostálgico, mas não como elemento narrativo, sendo difícil também justificar sua alegria e empolgação no meio de uma batalha supostamente tão importante e violenta, o que indica uma falta de controle alarmante de Abrams sobre o tom das performances, já que aquele júbilo diz respeito mais ao ator do que ao personagem. Esta, contudo, não é a única falha grave do cineasta, que também peca ao lado dos montadores Stefan Grube e Maryann Brandon na construção de um ritmo que não compreende a importância de pausas dramáticas, respiros e distâncias apropriadas entre motifs e pistas/recompensas: já no primeiro ato, Rey entrega a Leia o sabre de luz de Luke (Hamill) apenas para recebê-lo de volta alguns minutos depois, enquanto a frase “Nunca subestime um dróide” é repetida num espaço curtíssimo de tempo, como se os realizadores temessem que o espectador esquecesse a referência de uma cena para outra. Da mesma maneira, A Ascensão Skywalker jamais permite que o público registre o impacto mesmo dos acontecimentos supostamente mais dramáticos, já que cada um deles é seguido por uma piadinha ou por uma mudança brusca de cena – e a pressa em saltar constantemente de um lugar a outro é sempre um forte indício de um roteiro remendado e sem coesão interna. Aliás, o caos da montagem é tão grande que, em certo ponto, tive quase a impressão de ver dois Pryde (Grant) conversando com um subalterno. Outro reflexo desta abordagem trôpega pode ser constatado nas sequências de batalha, sejam estas com naves espaciais ou sabres de luz: coreografadas de modo entediante, elas usam a confusão como mise-en-scène, desperdiçando o bom trabalho de direção de arte que, como de hábito, cria espaços visualmente interessantes e com personalidades distintas (o que não inclui o “coliseu” – não sei bem como descrever aquilo - visto no ato final e cuja escuridão serve principalmente para ocultar a natureza misteriosa, jamais esclarecida, da multidão presente). Mas o grande problema de A Ascensão Skywalker reside mesmo em seu péssimo roteiro – o que me força, a partir deste ponto, a discutir elementos específicos da trama (portanto: spoilers a seguir): deixando bastante claro que jamais houve um planejamento cuidadoso dos arcos que deveriam ser traçados ao longo da nova trilogia, o roteiro de Abrams e Terrio (escrito a partir de argumento concebido por quatro pessoas) introduz vários personagens novos sem qualquer função (como o dróide D-O) ou que parecem ter sido criados para substituir outros menos “populares” (como a Jannah de Naomi Ackie, que assume o lugar de Rose ao lado de Poe), além de resgatar Lando Calrissian sem a preocupação de lhe dar algo relevante para fazer além de explorar a nostalgia do público. Para piorar, personagens antes importantes, como o General Hux (Gleeson), são despachados casualmente ao mesmo tempo em que o filme realiza a proeza de utilizar um recurso típico de novela mexicana – matar alguém apenas para trazê-lo de volta, explorando o impacto da morte sem ter que lidar com suas consequências – nada menos do que seis vezes ao longo dos 141 minutos de projeção. (Sim, seis: Chewbacca, Kylo Ren – duas vezes! -, Rey, Zoril e, de certa forma, C-3PO, que sacrifica a memória apenas para resgatá-la posteriormente.) Já as mortes “permanentes” não têm a força que deveriam, já que o longa nunca separa o tempo necessário para que possamos senti-las, saltando para a cena seguinte sem qualquer preocupação com o peso do que havia acabado de ocorrer. Isto, claro, não impede Abrams de empregar um truque vergonhoso para gerar lágrimas fáceis, trazendo Harrison Ford numa breve conversa que perde qualquer relevância ou força quando nos damos conta de que estamos basicamente vendo Kylo Ren conversar consigo mesmo. Como se não bastasse, a necessidade do cineasta (e do estúdio) de agradar os fãs revoltadinhos é tão grande que até a gag que trazia Luke atirando seu antigo sabre de luz sobre os ombros gera uma espécie de pedido de desculpas neste novo episódio ao trazer o espectro do mestre Jedi interferindo quando Rey tenta repetir seu gesto. (E por falar em sabres, introduzir um elemento tão importante quanto o sabre de Leia no nono filme e esperar que tenha relevância dramática é algo que beira o amadorismo.) Os problemas, porém, vão além, já que outro conceito supostamente essencial – o da “díade” – é atirado na trama de modo abrupto, ao passo que o retorno de Palpatine não só enfraquece o Episódio VI como simplifica a mitologia daquele universo de modo extremo até mesmo para os padrões de uma fábula originalmente concebida para atrair espectadores infanto-juvenis, já que converte o Imperador na origem de todo o mal visto ao longo das trilogias, já que este assume ter sido a “voz” por trás de todos os vilões da série. Ao mesmo tempo, se a ideia de estabelecer Rey como uma “ninguém” enriquecia tematicamente a saga, a revelação de sua verdadeira ascendência não só trai o que havia sido dito em Os Últimos Jedi (o fandom tóxico ganha novamente) como ainda transforma toda a luta contra o Império em uma disputa entre famílias. Cínico ao tentar posar como inclusivo ao incluir um rapidíssimo beijo lésbico visto à distância ao mesmo tempo em que falha em compreender o racismo implícito em introduzir uma mulher negra apenas para servir de possível interesse romântico para o único outro personagem negro da história (aproveitando para desfazer qualquer impressão de interesse sexual entre Finn e Poe, que também ganha um romance artificial), A Ascensão Skywalker parece, na maior parte do tempo, mais um filme da Marvel do que do universo Star Wars (algo que meu filho apontou corretamente assim que a sessão chegou ao fim) – e até mesmo o desfecho de Vingadores: Ultimato é repetido de maneira quase idêntica ao fim deste capítulo, com direito ao herói disposto a se sacrificar que, no último momento, ouve uma voz pelo fone de ouvido e é surpreendido pela aparição súbita de centenas de apoiadores. Digam o que quiserem sobre George Lucas e suas prequels - ao menos, o realizador tinha personalidade o suficiente para ignorar o fandom e fazer os filmes que desejava, mesmo que estes girassem em torno de taxações de rotas comerciais. E é uma imensa decepção que, tendo a oportunidade de encerrar a terceira de três trilogias, J.J. Abrams e os executivos da Disney tenham optado pelo caminho comercialmente mais seguro e, não por coincidência, artisticamente menos instigante. O que certamente agradará esta parte tóxica do fandom, que diz amar a família Skywalker sem perceber que adota a postura de alguém que já abraçou há muito o lado sombrio da Força.

"Dec 19, 2019"," For a Star Wars fan like myself (I still have the original 1977 program sold in the lobby), screening Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was both a proverbial labor of love AND a duty. My fervent anticipation of a new Star Wars flick was still flickering. Per se. However, News Flash: This grand finale to the “Skywalker Saga” nine films is a must see, but a bit disappointing. Credit J. J. Abrams, who co-wrote, co-produced and directed this episode as well as episode 7, The Force Awakens, in 2015. In his defense, it was a daunting task to tether all the plot lines and character elements into a cohesive conclusion. Think of all the characters from Luke Skywalker to Darth Vader to Palpatine to Kylo Ren and Rey. Then there are the robots, storm troopers, brothers and sisters (Luke and Leia), husbands and wives (Han and Leia), and various planet inhabitants. If it sounds like a bulk of beings to squeeze into 142 minutes, it is because it is. As a result, one has to look fast and wide to glimpse the many cameos and walk-ons.  The end result is an obviously huge scale action-adventure tale with state of the art effects and sparse time for good natured joking and character development. Then again, why is character development necessary? In most of the movie, it isn’t needed. We already know these people, these creatures, these robots. However, major characterization change does occur with two of the principal characters: the last Jedi Ren (played by Daisy Ridley); and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Supreme Leader of the First Order and son of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford).  To summarize the overall plot, using studio publicity, The Rise of Skywalker takes place “a year after the events of The Last Jedi. The remnants of the Resistance face the First Order once again—while reckoning with the past and their own inner turmoil. Meanwhile, the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith reaches its climax.” It is good seeing Carrie Fisher return as Leia, albeit via clever editing and unused footage from The Force Awakens. (Fisher died in 2016.) And 82 year-old Billy Dee Williams has more than just a line or two in his return as Lando Calrissian, the original owner of the Millennium Falcon.  Richard E. Grant, last year’s Best Supporting Actor Oscar winner for Can You Ever Forgive Me?, displays his evil chops as First Order General Pryde. The long list of Star Wars returnees  includes Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Lupita Nyong’o (Maz Kanata), Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine/Darth Sidious), John Boyega (Finn), and Joonas Suotamo (Chewbacca). Spoiler Alert: There are some surprise characters returning as well as some surprise deaths. That’s all I will reveal….except to look for a sea of quicksand.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker lacks the outright fun and originality of the previous episodes, but it achieves its goal of providing big scale closure.",POSITIVE

"Dec 19, 2019"," The dead speak! So begins the opening scrawl of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth episode in this ongoing cosmic space opera, and the final film in the latest trilogy beginning with J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens. Abrams is back with Rise of Skywalker, picking up where Rian Johnson’s masterful and boundary-pushing The Last Jedi left off. In my review of Johnson’s film, I wrote, “If J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens was an exercise in nostalgia, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi is an experiment of expectancy.” To continue in this vein, Abrams’ Rise of Skywalker is a capitulation to the fear of failure. Indeed, Yoda’s past exhortations that “fear is the path to the dark side” and “the greatest teacher, failure is” go unheeded here. Rise of Skywalker plays it safe and stays in its lane; it plays out like fan fiction with a multi-million dollar budget and the stifling expectations of an empire-like media conglomerate. If the dead speak in Rise of Skywalker, they have nothing bold or interesting to say. Following the events of The Last Jedi, the ongoing war between the First Order and the Resistance builds to a climax as a transmission from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, reprising his classic villainous role) draws Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) ever closer towards a final winner-takes-all battle. Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and those beloved droids, BB-8 and C-3PO (R2-D2 sadly just sits around doing nothing…again) go on a classic quest to find the source of the transmission and stop whatever Palpatine had planned long ago. There are elaborate clues and strange (but not too strange!) alien worlds and spaceship battles and ground battles and tracking devices and alien-filled cantinas and lots of witty banter and…I’m tired. So is the story. There are contrivances and conveniences and deux ex machinas aplenty. But most egregious is how Rise of Skywalker aims to deliberately rescind every brave plot point The Last Jedi accomplished. The Holdo maneuver? A foolish one-time act. Tossing a lightsaber over one’s shoulder? Let’s state it out loud: that’s wrong. Interesting female characters like Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran)? We’ll put them on the sidelines where they belong (a supporting role by the excellent Keri Russell is so underutilized as to be pointless). Rey’s backstory and identity? That wasn’t interesting enough for the fans, apparently, so Abrams and Co. correct that by force (pun intended). It feels like backpedaling at best, boilerplate at worst. Rise of Skywalker is risk-averse. What elevates the film’s wish fulfillment of fanboy theories are the performances from Driver and Ridley, whose dynamic throughout this most recent trilogy has been one of the films’ greatest strengths. I love their “Forcetime” chats, and their on-screen chemistry is palpable. Driver will likely win an Academy Award for his work in Marriage Story, and he brings similar gravitas and emotion to his role as the existentially tormented Ben Solo. Ridley is also exemplary here, imbuing Rey with both power and grace, confidence and vulnerability. Their conversations and battles stand out because they’re more than just plot beats—these are two emerging adults who have been wrestling with the central questions of identity (who am I? where do I belong? how am I unique? what is my place in the universe?) throughout these stories, and here they are finally making decisions in proactive ways that connote a sense of self-realization and care. It’s less angsty and more affecting. And Driver and Ridley truly commit to this stellar Romeo and Juliet story; the film is stronger for it. Still, I find myself more disappointed than satisfied with this final installment. The shot compositions are often formulaic or dull, and many of the scenes play out in such darkened locations that any sense of wonder or awe is often lost in the murky gray CGI aesthetic. The film doesn’t trust us enough whenever the stakes feel too intense, instead alleviating any sense of tension by revealing all too quickly that there’s a way of escape. There are brief sparks of humor and random cute aliens to “awww…” over and great losses of life to make us feel like things are dire, but nothing quite like previous episodes to make us laugh or weep. Which is perhaps Rise of Skywalker‘s biggest barrier to overcome: it had to distinguish itself amongst the other Star Wars films while closing the chapter on this Skywalker saga in an emotionally fulfilling way, one which honored all that came before while still offering something novel or surprising. But rather than a spirit of power or love or self-control, what Rise of Skywalker ultimately offers us is a spirit of timidity. I find its lack of faith—in its audience, in its predecessors, in itself—disturbing. The Last Jedi was absolute trash. You’re not fooling anyone into thinking that it’s anything but that, and the rest of your review is a total waste of time. Derrick, you sound so afraid and angry. Why? Remember, fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering. Hi Joel, I think your refusal to accept the back lash of the Last Jedi is a failure to understand good writing.  I’ll sum it up with a quote from William Goldman, “Give the audience what they want but in a way they didn’t expect.”  The Last Jedi did not give the audience what they wanted.  It gave them what they did not want in a way they would refuse to accept.  While I whole heartedly disagree with your review of The Last Jedi.  I also think that The Rise of Skywalker is poor. Not because it undid what Rian Johnson did but because it’s plotting was one large Mystery Box never opened.  Many fans are praising The Rise of Skywalker for its lack of Identity Politics and retrofitting Rian Johnson’s poor decisions.  However, that doesn’t make it a great film.  in fact, many online star wars influencers are quick to blast The Rise of Skywalker pointing out its issues.  It seems that this trilogy is one huge epic story about The Fall of Professional Critics and the Rise of Real Voices. For me, the massive flaws in the Rise of Skywalker actually put into perspective everything that the Last Jedi did right, and converted me from hating it to almost liking it.  I might have agreed with the angry guy in this thread before, but after seeing what Abrams did I am grasping for any creativity and poignancy at all, and at least the Last Jedi gave me that.  I will forever be disappointed that Luke never overcame his crippling fear save for one or two scenes before he disappeared, but at least it was a creative take on the character that gave us something to think about.   This creativity is something that the Rise of Skywalker truly lacked! I’m looking forward to seeing this, kinda.  I am not a huge fan of the Last Jedi but because I think it has real story and structure issues.  Some of the “surprising” choices are great —Snoke, parentage, Reylo—and some are bad:  space walking, poor communication from leadership, Canto Blight. But I am mostly regretting that Disney squandering the opportunity to make real engaging riproaring stories, of trying to make star wars movies instead of transformed Kurosawa and 1930s Flash Gordon flicks means that we’ll never get what could have been with Luke, Leia, and Han driving a story that delivers a meaningful handoff to a succeeding generation. Ed, I think your last point hits on the disappointment I’m feeling. There’s an attempt at a classic adventure story in RISE OF SKYWALKER—clues, codes, spies, etc.—but it’s squandered by what feels like safe choices. Hard to be an adventure without a sense of risk.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2019"," Since the first
one, the opening text crawls of the Star
Wars films have set up the plot in the most basic of terms, but none has
done as much heavy lifting or created such a sense of dread for what's to come
than the one in Star Wars: Episode IX 
The Rise of Skywalker. It yells at us, ""The dead speak!"" Then, the
real shock arrives: A broadcast from the long-dead emperor, whose dominion rose
and fell (Well, reverse that, since we saw the stories of the rise after the
stories of the fall) over the course of the six films before this new trio of
sequels, has been heard across the galaxy. This new
installment, a disappointing and wholly anticlimactic finale to both this sequel
trilogy and the whole of the nine-episode saga, was co-written and directed by
J.J. Abrams. Abrams, of course, displayed more than a bit of unwillingness to
take these stories in a new direction with Star
Wars: Episode VII  The Force Awakens. In a way, that was fine,
considering the film had to introduce new characters and find a way for their
journeys to fit within the big picture of an epic saga, as well as specifically
within the lives of the characters from the original films. Writer/director
Rian Johnson actually made the debate between the old and the new the heart of
his Star Wars:
Episode VIII  The Last Jedi. That film cared so deeply about the
charactersold and newand the mythology of these tales that the filmmaker
put them to a test with his expectation-matching-and-shattering story. The old
characters, especially Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker, were given new depth, and
the new characters finally seemed to be charting their own coursepart of the
old tales in terms of plotting but also very much their own journeys. Johnson
found the right balance. With the opening
exposition and the movie's dialogue-free prologue, Abrams puts a decisive end to
the debate between the old and the new, as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), slaughtering
and flying his way across the galaxy, discovers an ancient, hidden world. There,
he meets Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid)who seems in pretty good health,
considering our last image of him, falling into a great pit within a
planet-killing weapon just before it's blown upin the flesh. Palpatine wants
to begin his empire again, and he believes that Kylo will be the perfect
right-hand man for that job. Everything about
this final chapter, then, is defined by the old, even going so far as to
resurrect a dead villain (without any explanation beyond a throwaway line about
evil science and magic, mind you) just so Abrams, his co-screenwriter Chris
Terrio, and the audience can feel comfortable in knowing exactly where this
story will go and how it will unfold. The plot itself has our heroes, now just
pawns with bland personalities in a world-hopping adventure, fetching assorted
relics in their quest to find Palpatine and, once again, to put an end to his
reign of seemingly immortal terror. Rey (Daisy
Ridley), who is preternaturally strong in the Force and whose destiny was an
open question at the end of the previous film, has undergone training with Leia
(the late Carrie Fisher) and is still drawn toward the dark side of that
mystical power. She's the most fascinating character here, although that's
certainly not on account of the fact that we learn her true lineage (which just
raises many more questions). Her inner fight between good and ill continues,
although it's put on hold for a while so that all of those clues to Palpatine's
location can be found. As for our other
protagonists, Finn (John Boyega), the reformed stormtrooper, has become a
devoted hero in the Resistance against the First Order (which Palpatine had
controlled, apparently, meaning that the villainous organization is now just
what it always seemed to bea generic copy of the Empire). Poe (Oscar Isaac)
has become a leader and still remains reckless in his ways. The three characters
set off on their search for a compass to Palpatine's location, and aside from
some early bickering between Rey and Poe (as well as Finn wanting to tell Rey
something that, since it's never spoken, must not be too important), there's
nothing to these characters or their relationships that shows much personality,
let alone growth. The action
sequences, at least, are broadly entertaining. We get a couple of neat chases.
One has Poe outrunning fighters in the Millennium Falcon by repeatedly jumping
to light speed, putting the ship in assorted dangers, and another on a desert
planet, against hovering ships and rocket-powered soldiers, is familiar but
dynamic. A couple of duels between Rey, who wants revenge, and Kylo, who wants
her to turn dark and join him, keep making us question on which side of the
good/evil coin either one will land. This shouldn't
seem like a coin flip, though. That's what can happen when characters, their
development, and their choices take a backseat to spectacle and misguided
nostalgia. Star Wars: Episode IX  The
Rise of Skywalker latches its existence to the past, and in doing so, the
movie fails its own characters and story.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2019"," Lower your expectations, folks. Concluding the nine-movie Star Wars saga, The Rise of Skywalker simultaneously pushes back against the thematic depth of The Last Jedi and fails to grab the more straightforward thrills of The Force Awakens. In a move that’s sure to be hideously divisive, the film leans heavily on empty nostalgia, shoehorning legacy characters into a meandering treasure hunt for Sith artifacts. Certain elements seem directly aimed at an obnoxious minority of conservative fanboys, including sidelining The Last Jedi’s breakout character Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), whose tiny role consists of delivering lines like, “General, we have the coordinates!” Regardless of your feelings on nostalgia, this movie has a bad script. Co-written by director J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens) and Chris Terrio (Batman v Superman), it’s full of uninspiring dialogue where characters baldly explain things to each other, interspersed with quips that feel more Marvel-esque than the easy charm shared by Finn (John Boyega), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) in the last two films. Political commentary on the Resistance/First Order war is surprisingly minimal, mostly rehashing ideas they already covered. And much of the story follows a location-hopping quest to find a series of MacGuffins, at one point playing the narrative equivalent of Three Card Monte with a pair of lightsabers.  One of the key problems is something the film’s creators and fans are understandably hesitant to discuss: Carrie Fisher’s death. Originally, Leia was meant to play a major part like Han and Luke did in the last two movies. When Fisher passed away in 2016, Disney had to change tack for The Rise of Skywalker, which now has four credited screenwriters: Abrams and Terrio, plus additional “story by” credits for Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, who conceived an earlier draft. The resulting film uses brief clips that Carrie Fisher filmed for the last two movies, and it’s hard to ignore the structural ducking and weaving required to insert her into a new story. Attempting to include Leia as much as possible, we get scenes where someone else’s dialogue was clearly written to fit with whatever Leia footage they had available. If you’re aware of that, you’ll understand why we get an oddly nonspecific conversation where she and Rey hand a lightsaber back and forth. If you’re not aware, you’ll still probably sense that Leia’s role is oddly truncated and shallow. It’s a sensitive situation because Fisher was so universally beloved, and the writers couldn’t just get rid of Leia offscreen. Still, the end result is noticeably awkward. For instance, if you’re wondering why Rey went back to wearing an outfit from the first movie, it’s probably because she had to fit into archival footage with Fisher. Rogue One and Solo garnered media attention for creative disruption behind the scenes, but The Rise of Skywalker actually came away with more visible structural problems—not to mention uneven characterization and derailed arcs after The Last Jedi. Abrams was apparently determined to undo Rian Johnson’s most interesting creative choices, exemplified by a scene where Kylo Ren welds his shattered helmet back together. You’d better believe that the Knights of Ren (an Abrams creation) get plenty of screentime, but do they get personalities, backstory, or any kind of thematic purpose? Do they hell. Daisy Ridley and John Boyega have both spoken about how much they enjoyed working together on The Force Awakens, and how dismayed they were to be separated in The Last Jedi. Over time, this became one of the many controversies around TLJ, with Disney promoting this film a reunion for the main “trio.” The problem is that the trio never existed onscreen. In The Force Awakens, Poe and Finn have a relationship, and Rey and Finn have a relationship. Rey and Poe are total strangers, and Abrams ended the film by splitting them all up: Rey to visit Luke, Poe with the Resistance, and Finn in a coma. Rian Johnson picked up the pieces with separate subplots for each character, and while The Rise of Skywalker brings them together at last, the relationship doesn’t fully land.  Finn and Poe (and arguably the entire Resistance) are secondary to the conflict between Jedi and Sith, starring Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Unlike recent Star Wars movies, which emphasize solidarity and the importance of everyday rebellion, Rey’s storyline harks back to the prequel trilogy idea that a ritualized struggle between Jedi and Sith overshadows everything else in the galaxy.  It’s now time to discuss my one and only spoiler of this review, although it’s something we learn in the first five minutes. Inexplicably delving into an already-concluded period of the franchise, Abrams resurrects Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) as the main antagonist.  Unlike the more personal threats and anti-fascist politics of the last two films, Palpatine’s return raises the stakes to an absurd, almost meaningless degree. As always, McDiarmid has tremendous fun playing a cackling old zombie wizard. But we simply do not need to see a Rey-centric retread of Palpatine’s seduction of Anakin Skywalker. Fans of the Rey/Kylo Ren relationship will enjoy how much intense, emotionally charged screentime they share, but the film’s attitude to the Force and the Jedi/Sith war is disappointingly simplistic. After two movies with a more ambivalent and nuanced attitude to the Force, the finale is suddenly obsessed with Sith and Jedi legacies. The sociopolitical ideas that Abrams set up in The Force Awakens—the First Order’s insidious rise as neo-Nazi analogues; the futility of Kylo Ren’s petulant obsession with genetic legacy—are swept aside in favor of the Emperor zapping things with Force lightning. While Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver give powerful performances as two people locked together in a symbiotic rivalry, their arc requires us to ignore Kylo Ren’s genocidal leadership of the First Order. Rey, caught in a tumult of emotion, is terrified of turning to the Dark Side—yet still compelled by Kylo Ren, her only peer as a Force-user. Meanwhile, Ren is as conflicted as ever, hoping to usurp the Emperor without killing Rey. Building on The Last Jedi’s psychic Skype sessions, the two characters clash again and again, each hoping to convert the other. But in order for this to work, it has to be presented as a spiritual dispute, ignoring the rest of the war. Rey’s desire to save “Ben Solo” only works if we forget that he’s basically Hitler Junior, commanding planetary massacres and enslaving millions of children like Finn. If we’re meant to root for even the hypothetical concept of redemption, we must focus exclusively on the relationship between Rey and Ben Solo, separate from the struggles of the Resistance. It’s a morally and narratively incoherent idea, elevated by Driver and Ridley’s performances. Oddly enough, The Rise of Skywalker’s nostalgia content isn’t very effective. In The Force Awakens, Abrams struck an effective balance between new material and fond references to the original trilogy, provoking sentimental nostalgia with visual and thematic callbacks. This film felt much clumsier, particularly the roles given to several returning characters. Lando Calrissian was a notable example because while he’s a famously distinctive figure, his returning role was oddly un-Lando-like. Was he cool and resourceful, with a faint whiff of moral ambiguity? Not really. He was just Billy Dee Williams wearing an appropriate costume, showing up for a handful of scenes to deliver unmemorable dialogue. As for Chewie and C-3PO, they simply didn’t need to be there. They’re important to a certain subplot, but their roles feel like the result of a brainstorming session for “How do we include Chewie and C-3PO?” It’s especially galling in the context of Rose Tico’s reduced screentime, which tacitly endorses all the racist and sexist backlash against her character. For a film with such an extensive ensemble cast, the balance between meaningful roles was totally disjointed. General Hux (Domnhall Gleeson) and his new workplace frenemy General Pryde (Richard E. Grant) both had fun little parts to play. Jannah (Naomi Ackie) made an immediate impact as a new Resistance ally. The masked gangster Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) felt slightly like an unwanted attempt to make Poe Dameron straight, but otherwise got a pretty decent role. It’s the pre-existing heroes who got shafted, from Rose’s background role to Poe’s incoherent personality, to the older characters who honestly should’ve been cut. And that’s without going into the numerous fake-outs where characters “die” but secretly survive; a cheap ploy that undercuts the supposedly high stakes. I went into The Rise of Skywalker expecting J.J. Abrams to backtrack on some of Rian Johnson’s bolder creative choices, but ultimately deliver a satisfying-but-conservative story like The Force Awakens. The reality was much worse. Along with its transparent desire to coddle fans who hated The Last Jedi, the screenplay lacked the poetry and thematic weight we’ve come to expect. Characters were mishandled and dialogue was bland, dragging the heroes from place to place in a formulaic MacGuffin hunt. Perhaps most surprisingly, it didn’t even measure up to the visual flair of the last two films. With a colossal team of artists and technicians on staff, Star Wars always offers a cornucopia of gorgeous costumes, props, and alien locations. Visual symbolism and musical cues are central to the franchise’s staying power, thriving on tiny-but-memorable details of design and worldbuilding. Yet halfway through The Rise of Skywalker, I found myself thinking: “Wait. Does this movie look… kind of bad?” Not bad by average blockbuster standards, but certainly subpar for Star Wars. We visit some cool new planets, but the film lacked any equivalent of iconic setpieces like Rey’s introduction on Jakku, or the throne room duel in The Last Jedi. The Palpatine scenes were simply murky. One First Order infiltration sequence felt like a repeat of old material. Aside from a cute new droid, the orbaks (Jannah’s alien horses), and the diminutive Babu Frik, there was an unexpected dearth of charmingly weird background figures, normally the bread-and-butter of the franchise. So while The Rise of Skywalker’s production values were high, J.J. Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel (The Force Awakens) kind of dropped the ball. Amid the conflicting desires to include Carrie Fisher, appease conservative fans, reintroduce J.J. Abrams’ favorite characters, and tie everything back into the Jedi/Sith wars, The Rise of Skywalker is disappointingly muddled. The prequel trilogy tells us that Star Wars fans will find something to love in the worst of movies, and I’m sure that will happen here. But for now, this feels like an artistically and thematically dispiriting conclusion to the saga.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 19, 2019"," So for the third time in history, Star Wars comes to an end but not really. We already know there are more movies and TV shows in the works, but The Rise of Skywalker draws a line in the sand and ends what we now call The Skywalker Saga. It’s been a long and rocky road to this finish line filled with production troubles and a divided fanbase that has kept everyone wracked with one question: how do you end Star Wars? Well, The Rise of Skywalker certainly is a way of doing it, though I’m hard pressed to say it’s the best way. Evident right from how the first paragraph of the opening title crawl drops a huge story-shattering plot point with no build-up, the biggest problem ailing The Rise of Skywalker is pacing. After the deliberate and contemplative The Last Jedi, the ninth instalment constantly feels like it’s trying to make up for lost time and hurries itself at nearly every moment. The film is jam-packed with exposition as our heroes dash from one locale to the next, engaging in an action set piece and a bewildering plot twist at every stop on the journey. Whilst the wit and heart JJ Abrams established in The Force Awakens is still present, there are barely any moments of downtime to appreciate the world or ruminate on our character’s trajectory. What moments of character introspection there are do land, and certain moments may have some long-time fans shedding a tear, but nothing gets a chance to sit still. As for the story itself, well…I didn’t think they could make a more divisive Star Wars movie than The Last Jedi, but Abrams and co have done it. There’s a lot of smaller plot beats that do really work, particularly those that expand on the trilogy’s themes of defying destiny and withstanding overwhelming odds, but many of the core ideas the film is built around are shaky and best and outright preposterous at worst. It’s hard to deny the passion and devotion Abrams has poured into the film, but ultimately his unbridled fandom is the film’s downfall, as at every turn it takes the easy way out and answers what remaining questions it can with obvious, disappointing answers (oh, and plenty of unanswered questions remain). They certainly do mine plenty of pathos and closure out of these moments, and some of them very much enhance the themes and ideas George Lucas himself established for the franchise, but at their core some of these ideas would not feel out of place in a fan fiction. Whilst I do compliment Abrams for avoiding just recreating Return of the Jedi with a different coat of paint, and the difficulty of ending a franchise this storied and beloved must have been intense, everything wrong with The Rise of Skywalker can be traced back to the screenplay. The film itself is as professionally presented and sculpted as any of the post-Lucas entries, but more now than ever has the lack of planning on Lucasfilm’s part bitten them in the backside. In retrospect, perhaps it wasn’t the best idea to entrust ending one of cinema’s hugest franchises to the guy who co-wrote Batman v Superman? As a result of the rushed pacing, one of the biggest casualties is how the series’ talented cast gets little time to celebrate their accomplishments and enjoy their characters for one last time. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver remain the central focus of the film’s story as Rey and Kylo Ren respectively, and their characters are the only ones given much development. Ridley is tasked with playing a much more nuanced Rey, with her optimism in the previous instalments replaced with anxiety and determination, resulting in a trilogy-wide arc that feels conclusive if a little lopsided. Driver too is challenged with the conflict inside Kylo, and his performance ranges from unbridled anger to scared silence; he really knows how to get across a lot with just some subtle facial expressions. Even as their connected storyline pays off in a slightly obvious and tawdry fashion, they perform it with so much gusto that it hits more often than it doesn’t. In stark contrast and despite being present for as much of the film’s story as Rey and Kylo, nowhere near as much care is paid to John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe. Whilst the pair do give it their all and retain their infectious chemistry, they have no discernable arcs other than reaffirming what they already learnt about heroism and sacrifice in The Last Jedi; it’s like how Return of Jedi spent so much time bringing Han Solo back only to do nothing with him all over again. Lupita Nyong’o’s Maz Kanata has more screen time than she did last time around but somehow has even less to do, Domnhall Gleeson’s General Hux gets a moment to shine before unceremoniously exiting, and Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico is absolutely done dirty by being sidelined until the third act and given little to do but spout exposition. Even the new characters feel like after-thoughts that could have easily been merged with existing players; Richard E. Grant’s General Pryde practically just slots into Hux’s role, whilst Naomi Ackie’s Jannah could have been Rose with a few rewrites. General Leia’s role is handled as gracefully as they can with the limited footage remaining of the late Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams is a tad superfluous as the returning Lando Calrissian but he’s clearly having fun with the role, and Mark Hamill brings back a little of that old trilogy charm as Luke Skywalker one last time. However, the main returning attraction is absolutely Ian McDiarmid as Emperor Palpatine. Though his inclusion in the story will certainly prove divisive, having McDiarmid back in full-on Revenge of the Sith “unlimited power!” force is a devious delight. Oh, and C-3PO actually gets something to do and Anthony Daniels is as blissfully whimsical as ever and everything he says in the movie made me happy, so that’s a solid positive. On a technical level, The Rise of Skywalker is as beautifully executed as all of Lucasfilm’s recent entries. The return to the original trilogy’s aesthetic with a modern twist is still in full force, and the number of new worlds and creatures on display continues to astonish. The film is a visual delight with striking cinematography and imaginative production design, bolstered by a still-seamless blend of practical and visual effects. John Williams delivers his swan song as composer of the series, beautifully weaving in themes from across all three trilogies into the score whilst still surprising us with new compositions; the theme for the Knights of Ren is especially menacing. However, the topic of pacing continues to be a running theme through this critique, and the film’s erratic editing is another big culprit. The film’s first act is especially muddled and disarming, with the series’ signature wipe transitions ramped up as we swiftly cut from location to location. The editing luckily finds a better rhythm by the halfway point, but it remains an issue throughout, and it all screams of a production that either shot way too much footage or not enough. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is like being in a one-sided relationship: it keeps doing things that make you want to leave whilst doing just enough to make you stay, and at every point you’re willing to forgive and move on it slights you again. It tries to be everything to every kind of Star Wars fan, hurriedly wrapping up the saga in a convenient bow, but it instead often comes off as trite and sycophantic. As opposed to the prequels, which generally had solid intentions but simply executed them poorly, this is a film riddled with bad ideas that they’ve somehow executed with heart and effort. It’s far from being lazy or boring or even unimaginative; the final product is far too humungous and gaudy to be any of those things. For better and worse, it is absolutely a Star Wars film as made by a Star Wars fan, and as clumsily and perplexingly as it chooses to end the series…it does accomplish those goals. There’s an adage frequently repeated by characters in this film along the lines of, “If we don’t do this now, everything we have worked for will have been for nothing.” That couldn’t be a more apt metaphor for what happened to this movie. It is the most baffling and disappointing end to a trilogy since The Matrix Revolutions and, whilst it doesn’t negate the quality and accomplishments of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, it will leave a bittersweet taste in the mouths of many fans. I do not hate The Rise of Skywalker. I am not demanding that we get a do-over. I do not condone sending abuse in the direction of JJ Abrams, Kathleen Kennedy or anyone else in the cast and crew. It’s merely a subpar entry in a franchise that has already had several subpar entries. Nothing more, nothing less. As frustrated and saddened I am by how it’s all ended up, it does not change how much this franchise means to me and to cinema in general, with all and the ups and downs it has been through over four decades of storytelling. Congrats on making it to the finish line, Star Wars. It hasn’t always been easy, but I’m glad you’re still here.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 19, 2019"," The Star Wars series doesn’t really end, but given the elegant decision to tell this epic in chunks of three movies, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker marks a stopping point for the films that began four years ago, and I find it to be a satisfactory conclusion. That might sound like lukewarm praise to you, but don’t underestimate the difficulty of doing that in a series that has spanned so many decades and is freighted with so many expectations from billions of fans. The film begins with Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) returning from the dead, where Return of the Jedi seemed to have left him. He’s planning on re-launching the Sith order from a planet that’s off all the star maps, with an army of star destroyers that all have the capability to blow up worlds. With less than 24 hours to do so, Rey (Daisy Ridley) goes after him to stop a galaxy-wide apocalypse. Oddly, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is also hunting down the emperor, because he’s just been made supreme leader and has no intention of giving up the sweet job he just got. My biggest issue with this is Palpatine himself. His resurrection is announced brusquely in the prefatory crawl, and you’d think that someone conquering death would be a bigger deal. He was an uninteresting villain in Return of the Jedi, and the passage of 36 years has done nothing to make him less so. His harangues about power and destiny are thankfully not as lengthy as the ones he gave Luke Skywalker back then, but we still don’t receive much sense of the temptations of the Dark Side that he offers to Rey. If we’re going to be in suspense about whether good characters might turn evil, the evil should be more alluring. The climactic showdown between her and him doesn’t have anything like the massing of forces that Avengers: Endgame gave us. As a matter of fact, the whole Star Wars saga as a whole has blown chance after chance to use the different sides of the Force to comment meaningfully on the struggle between good and evil in all of us, despite a development at the end that partially makes up for that. Director/co-writer J.J. Abrams does manage to spike the proceedings with humor, even if he hurries through the jokes to bring the film’s running time down to 141 minutes. The Star Wars saga has always been good for presenting us with unimaginable vistas, and this one has a ragtag band of ex-Imperial stormtroopers launching a raid on top of a star destroyer while riding the backs of tusked horses. Even better is the extended duel between Rey and Kylo Ren on top of a wrecked airship in the ocean, with both combatants being soaked by the surf and being worn down by the length of the fight. That scene also includes Rey’s backstory being revealed, one that resembles not only Luke Skywalker’s but also Jesus Christ’s and explains why she has so much power and is able to communicate with Ren across star systems. That fight also goes really dark when Leia (Carrie Fisher) intervenes. I don’t think I’m spoiling anything when I say that she dies in this film, and while this development may have been forced by Fisher’s real-life death two years ago, it’s done with enough skill that it feels organic to the story. One of the themes of this recent trio of Star Wars films is that the old order passes away and a new group of people have to take up the fight. Abrams and Rian Johnson have managed this beautifully, and when Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) joins the Resistance as the last leader from the old days, he has some sage words for the new leaders. The script is full of callbacks and references to the previous films, and yet even if the bulk of them go over your head, they won’t hold up the pace. The Rise of Skywalker’s epilogue brings things back to Tatooine, the desert planet where all this started, and if we’re all back here in 20 years for another trilogy, we’ll be lucky to have storytellers as skilled to lead us through it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," All movies are Rorschach tests to some extent. What we feel about them, what we want from them and what we see in them derives from who we are when we go into the theatre. Even so, STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, the ninth and (reportedly) last film in the Skywalker saga, is more of a Rorschach test than most. Different viewers by now have developed particular wants and needs in relation to the STAR WARS films. What may cause one viewer to well up with emotion may tempt another to hurl footwear at the screen. Reviewing STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is doubly tricky, because just about any plot or character references may be taken as spoilers. Based on how the last film in the series ended, it’s probably will surprise no one that as, the new film opens, the malevolent First Order and the benevolent Resistance are still trying to destroy each other. Power-hungry Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is now in charge of the First Order; General Leia (Carrie Fisher) is still running the resistance. Our heroes, Luke Skywalker’s disciple Rey (Daisy Ridley), former storm trooper Finn (John Boyega), and ace pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), are very much in the thick of things. It’s clear that director J.J. Abrams (returning as helmer after the seventh film, STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS) and his co-screenwriter Chris Terrio have great respect for what they’re dealing with and are doing their best to pay respect to every aspect that they can. They deserve a lot of credit for keeping Leia a vital part of the story, even though actress Fisher passed away in 2016. We can tell the visual tricks they’re using, but they’re not distracting, and the General is as present as she needs to be. The visual effects and stunts are what we’ve come to expect from STAR WARS. There are also some lovely little grace notes, including one that demonstrates laughter is universal. It’s a moment not directly connected to any of the main plotlines, but it serves to illustrate, in a very STAR WARS way, just what it is the Resistance is fighting so hard to preserve. Ridley and Boyega are stalwart, and Isaac brings wry personality to his role. It’s definitely pleasing to see certain characters get their due, and fun to spot some name actors, mostly longtime Abrams colleagues, who pop up throughout. But who wants what out of this? Is the STAR WARS saga a seasonal joy, a longtime love, or a piece of one’s soul? Is everything tied together, or are there loose, contradictory ends? Trying to convey how viewers may react to STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER – spoiler-free, no less – is like trying to evaluate someone else’s spiritual experience after a religious ceremony, without knowing that person’s religious background in the first place. May the Force be with those who make the attempt.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," “Long have I waited…” as Palpatine says, and indeed forty-two years, eight main films and two spin-offs later, it’s time to lay the Skywalker saga to rest. Star Wars movies have an uncanny ability to polarise fans like no other franchise. Sometimes it seems that Star Wars, along with Doctor Who, are the main targets of what has become known as toxic fandom due to the passionate negativity they seem to generate. And this film will be no different. From the scene immediately following John Williams’ proud fanfare and the usual title crawl, The Rise of Skywalker barely pauses for breath, getting straight to work with a dazzling mix of visual brilliance, stunning action sequences and good-natured humour that immediately establishes this as a Star Wars film in the classic style. There’s a lot to unpack here, which is essentially J.J. Abrams’ Christmas gift to the Star Wars faithful, showing us just how much had already been foreshadowed in the two earlier entries in the trilogy, and leaves us with a proper closure to all nine with no threads left hanging.  We’re told in the opening crawl that Palpatine’s voice has been heard, and both sides, good and evil are in a desperate race to locate him. The returning Ian McDiarmid is absolutely on top form here. His Palpatine is truly the stuff of nightmares, his every slight gesture oozes cancerous, corrupting evil, every line delivered with a relish that drips with menace. The last quarter of the film channels scenes from Return of the Jedi – but within the plot narrative, it’s entirely appropriate and veers off on a tangent of its own to bring the saga to a conclusion that’s satisfyingly perfect, with a plot twist revelation that will rival Darth Vader’s shock announcement in The Empire Strikes Back.  Carrie Fisher, we’re told, appears in the film thanks to some unused footage left over from The Force Awakens – but frankly, you would swear that the late actress had been on the set of The Rise of Skywalker. Thanks to the digital sorcery of Industrial Light & Magic, Leia’s appearances in this film are largely seamless (a flashback sequence with a younger CGI version of the character being the exception). Ultimately, Princess Leia is given the send-off the character so richly deserves. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Star Wars film without the usual tropes which fans look out for, so yes, we do hear that a character “has a bad feeling about this” there’s the odd “utini”, and there’s an adorable new character for the toy market in D-O, a droid with social anxiety. But most of all, it gives full rein to the further fleshing out of the central characters of Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren, while also giving an opportunity to several of the older characters to say their proper farewells, some in voiceovers, others in person – again with at least one major surprise that will warm even the most hardened heart. It also finally gives Anthony Daniels some meat to work with as C-3PO; our favourite protocol droid having been reduced to a cameo in this trilogy until now. The full comic range and pathos of the character is given ample opportunity to shine as the confused and befuddled droid suffers a memory wipe for the greater good. John Williams’ score alternates bombast with melancholy, using several themes we’ve heard before, again a sure-fire fan pleaser.  J.J. Abrams has pulled off the seemingly impossible and delivered one of the best films of the year, with a final scene that couldn’t possibly be more perfect, bringing us a nostalgic echo of where it all started in 1977. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," A wary and broken hero searching for the truth about their family. A ragtag group of rebels facing impossible odds. An all-knowing hooded figure with a nefarious plan. Bickering droids. Alien critters that are ready-for-Christmas cute. So much of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is pulled from what has come before, and so much of it carries the wear and tear of repetition. I understand why director J.J. Abrams and his team went for the well-worn route – if it worked once, why can’t it work again? Except, as we enter this allegedly final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, there is the distinct feeling that we’ve all been conned. Not only as audiences who expect something new and inventive from the blockbuster realm, but also those dyed-in-Wookiee-wool moviegoers for whom Star Wars means more than most products of Western civilization. Despite the vast deepness and immense possibilities of George Lucas’s long-ago galaxy located far, far away, Disney’s Star Wars is more an exercise in exhumation than storytelling. But The Rise of Skywalker’s reliance on nostalgia – on digging up the past and reliving it rather than reinterpreting or reworking it – does help wash away whatever lingering guilt I have over recycling an artistic device of my own, one that I promised myself I would only use once and only under the most extraordinary of circumstances. But as J.J. Abrams might have said while working on his new film, to hell with guilt! And so, I present an eight-part quiz-review of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. c) a generation-defining battle between the two sides of the Force, as epitomized by the headstrong Jedi-in-training Rey and the evil [redacted] … dang it!

"Dec 19, 2019"," In the wake of behind-the-scenes turbulence on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker — the final chapter in the new Star Wars trilogy and the Skywalker saga on the whole — that led to J.J. Abrams' hiring, there were immediate concerns. What route would The Force Awakens director take, having made an enjoyable rehash of A New Hope the first time around, but been dealt a subversive middle chapter by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi? Would Abrams honour the values of its direct predecessor or would he return to dig into the nostalgia? The first trailer for The Rise of Skywalker hinted Abrams was tilting towards the latter, as one would expect, what with the reveal that Sith dark lord Palpatine, killed by Darth Vader over 30 years ago, would be involved in some manner. The rest of the film confirms our worst fears. The Rise of Skywalker — out December 20 in cinemas in India and across the world — proves that Abrams clearly harbours too much love and respect for the original trilogy. Forget building on where the divisive yet brilliant The Last Jedi left the galaxy of Star Wars, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (Argo, Justice League) choose to ignore the film altogether, be it its messaging or its characters. Instead, The Rise of Skywalker opts to collapse onto itself. It packs itself full of references, cameos, and flashbacks that are gratuitous to say the least. And in turning inward rather than facing outward, it's not only a betrayal of what The Last Jedi had put forth, but a disservice to George Lucas' imagination with the franchise in the first place. The Rise of Skywalker ultimately plays it so safe that it makes you wonder if it was designed by committee — or a global forum of Star Wars fans who threw everything they love about Star Wars in a blender. It's too afraid to really commit to anything. Big consequential moments, be it character deaths or narrative revelations, are set up, only to be abandoned. This preference for chickening out remains true across The Rise of Skywalker, as it delivers a sweet family-friendly ending about good triumphing over evil. There's no problem with that lesson as such, but in context of the film's events — and a nine-chapter story that began four decades ago — it all feels rather underwhelming. Surely there must be more to the Skywalker saga than this? Evidently not. In an attempt to cloak its many troubles, Abrams applies a veneer of breakneck pace to The Rise of Skywalker from the start. The traditional opening crawl informs us that the voice of the seemingly-dead Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been heard across the galaxy, which drives Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — the new Supreme Leader of the villainous First Order — to hunt him down, to prevent any challenge to his authority. Meanwhile, the good guys of the Resistance in Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are also on the lookout for Palpatine, which requires them to find a MacGuffin, one of many lazy writing choices in The Rise of Skywalker. This essentially drives the first half of the film, as the Millennium Falcon crew hop across planets in its search. This allows The Rise of Skywalker to pull in new characters who are meant to reflect on the core ones. There's Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell), an old criminal friend of Poe's who didn't depart on the best of terms. And there's Jannah (Naomi Ackie), an ex-Stormtrooper who defected from the First Order, like Finn. Alongside, the film also makes room for Resistance leader Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016), appearing with the help of unreleased footage and digital wizardry, in addition to bit parts for Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Leia's twin brother Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). But The Rise of Skywalker is always in such a rush that it has no time to reflect on the end of an era, let alone serve its new characters or develop existing ones in a meaningful way. The new Star Wars movie's failure with characters robs it of any depth. The mystery of Rey's parentage — Abrams said there would be more to it in The Rise of Skywalker — is resolved in an off-handed and highly questionable manner, which also reverses what The Last Jedi had bravely done. Meanwhile, Ren's journey isn't properly earned and feels abruptly cut. But that's more than you can say about the others. Though both Finn and Poe are constantly involved in the proceedings, their arcs barely progress. A minor villain is written out by making him behave stupidly, and even as the film proclaims to “never underestimate a droid”, it largely treats them as furniture save in one important subplot. The Rise of Skywalker's biggest character crime, though, is Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), Finn's friend introduced in The Last Jedi, who is stuck in a corner as the film doesn't know what to do with her. Still, The Rise of Skywalker could get away with all that were its emotional core — Rey and Kylo Ren's connection — cooked to perfection. And to an extent, it does manage that. The deeply-felt scenes involving Ridley and Driver are the rare occasions that the film slows down and takes a breather. Their exchanges, most of which make use of the clever connect introduced in The Last Jedi, flesh out the characters' mental states, their respective struggle with the light and dark side of the Force, and their mixed feelings for one another that drives them to try and bring the other over to their side. But The Rise of Skywalker also muddies this yin and yang by unnecessarily dropping in an old villain, whose return isn't justified and whose presence detracts from the relationship between the central duo. And as two of the remaining wielders of lightsabers, Rey and Kylo Ren are also responsible for some impressive duels in The Rise of Skywalker, though the fights are a far cry from the zenith that was the two of them taking on former Supreme Leader Snoke's Praetorian Guards in The Last Jedi. Even in terms of action sequences, the new Star Wars movie doesn't have anything to rival what came before. The set-pieces involving star fighters aren't orchestrated in a coherent and emotionally powerful way, with Abrams lacking the thrill he delivered on The Force Awakens, and Johnson's ingenuity and imagination from The Last Jedi. The Rise of Skywalker also lack its predecessor's wit and humour smarts, even as it crafts a few funny moments with Poe, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and new alien Babu Frik. Combine that with poor dialogue and a tendency for cheap exposition, and you're left with a film that makes its characters say things out loud that shouldn't need to be said. Abrams seems to have forgotten the filmmaking principle of “show not tell”. The Rise of Skywalker also feels disjointed at times, almost as if it's been through patchwork that's left behind visible seams, just like the red scars in Kylo Ren's haphazardly repaired helmet. But Abrams' biggest crime, by far, is how he's so beholden to the past of Star Wars. His obsession — or fear, one could argue — drives him to link as many dots as possible, and in doing so, he fails to heed the message that was served up by its predecessor: “Let the past die.” It's called The Rise of Skywalker, but if anything, it's a death-knell for the Skywalker saga.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," As with whole Star Wars franchise, main tension here is between good and evil, light and dark. Characters discover nuances of humanity and how people aren't generally all one thing or the other. Story underlines idea that everyone has a choice about which moral code to believe in, which mission to accept. Your family/background doesn't determine your destiny. Promotes transformative power of hope, and importance of friendship, courage, teamwork, loyalty, trust, listening to others, faith. Rey continues to be strong, capable, courageous, but this time also deals with inner conflict. She must decide whether to follow the path of the Jedi or indulge in her newfound sense of anger and frustration. Other female characters -- including General Leia, Rose, and some new faces -- are well represented making tough decisions, leading bravely, and more. Finn and Poe learn to lead together and to put mission above personal conflicts. Their friendship and teamwork fittingly rallies the Republic around helping Rey. First Order is depicted as mostly male and largely white, while Resistance is notably diverse both in skin color and in various species, with women in leadership positions. Tons of sci-fi action violence, both large-scale space battles/explosions and one-on-one duels, shoot-outs, tense chases/crashes. A few explicit but not bloody deaths: A non-human severed head is unceremoniously presented to the First Order (some greenish goop, but no red blood), a traitor is summarily executed, an entire field of Resistance forces is shown dead, a character's skin and face crumble/melt away, Kylo Ren kills and maims many enemies with his lightsaber. One character's wound is shown close-up; a skeleton is seen. Both sides sustain lots of casualties. Spoiler alert: Several primary and supporting characters are killed, and nearly everyone is injured at one point. A couple of key characters are presumed captured or killed. A few deaths will be extra emotional for audiences. Many weapons are used in addition to lightsabers: blaster guns, planet-killer weapons, bombs, grenades, daggers, arrows, fighter planes. An officer orders an entire fleet destroyed. A leader orders an entire planet destroyed. Creepy villain, dark/scary locations, and a couple of large, scary worm-like monsters. Frequent peril and danger. Arguments. Two characters continue to have an intense, supernatural bond that sometimes feels romantic. Poe comedically asks another character for a kiss two times. Several charged/longing looks. Embraces/brief kisses (both opposite-sex and, extremely briefly, same-sex). Nothing in the movie, but off camera there's an entire universe of merchandise available, from branded/themed apparel, board games, video games, accessories, housewares, action figures, Lego sets, food, toys, and just about anything else you can consume that can be a tie-in. Parents need to know that Star Wars: Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker is the ninth and final film in the four-decade-long Skywalker saga (and the third installment in the current trilogy). Following the events of Episode VIII: The Last Jedi, the film focuses on the battle between the villainous First Order, led by Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and the virtuous Resistance fighters, embodied by the last Jedi, Rey (Daisy Ridley). Everything is on the line in this installment, which means the sci-fi action violence is ratcheted up a notch: You can expect even more major space battles, high-stakes destruction, tense chases/crashes, peril, injury, and fierce lightsaber duels (plus blasters, arrows, cannons, and other weapons). This movie feels a little more intense and darker than the previous two in this trilogy, with creepy villains and locations and a few explicit (but not bloody) deaths, including a beheading, a point-blank execution, and a body crumbling to bits. Spoiler alert: Several primary and supporting characters are killed, and a few of those deaths will be extra emotional for audiences. There are also some scenes with lots of flashing lights, which could be difficult for those with photosensitivity. While there's not a lot of romance, the film does include some longing looks, embraces, and a couple of kisses. Language isn't frequent, but you will hear ""ass,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn."" Women continue to hold strong positions in the Resistance, and there are strong messages of courage, teamwork, hope, and loyalty. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. STAR WARS: EPISODE IX: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER starts off with the usual scrolling exposition: In a galaxy far, far away, what remains of the Resistance regroups after the devastating losses of The Last Jedi, while Rey (Daisy Ridley) trains with the Force and new Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the First Order look for a secret Sith lair that's broadcasting pro-Emperor Palpatine propaganda. Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Chewbacca continue on their mission to subvert the First Order and help Rey save the day. Kylo Ren attempts to lure Rey to the Dark Side, believing that their special supernatural Force connection means they're destined to share a throne and rule together. In battle after battle, the two forces fight for the future of the galaxy. Technically slick and impressively performed, this final installment is definitely entertaining, but the considerable fan service and nostalgic callbacks make it less epic than we might have hoped. Audiences will marvel at the elaborate set pieces, the plentiful Easter eggs, and the intricately choreographed battle sequences (the storyboarding must have been amazing). The talented stars are all back -- even the late Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa. Hopefully they were so bountifully compensated that they can now go on to long careers doing whatever film they want. It's telling, though, that of Driver's three big roles in 2019 (alongside Marriage Story and The Report), this is his least extraordinary. That's because, despite the buddy-adventure humor of the Poe-and-Finn storyline, the fascinating plot revelations (no spoilers here!), and the Game of Thrones-style intrigue, the story and writing can occasionally become unwieldy as director J.J Abrams overstuffs the movie that signals the end of an era. Speaking for those who don't possess encyclopedic knowledge of every character name and subplot of the three Skywalker trilogies, it's possible to enjoy this film without total recall of the earlier movies -- but those who do remember the meaning of particular characters, species, locations, and vehicles will feel extra rewarded. To spell those particulars out would be to spoil several applause-worthy moments, but if moviegoers have the time, they might re-watch The Empire Strikes Back, Revenge of the Sith, and The Last Jedi to maximize their understanding of the story in Episode IX. The best part of Rise of Skywalker might be the satisfying nostalgia, but it's ultimately about another central trio of friends with sketchy backgrounds (a former scavenger, a Stormtrooper, and a spice runner) who answered a higher calling for themselves, the Force, and the galaxy. Families can talk about the violence in Star Wars: Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker. Do scenes of explosions and space battles affect you differently than those of close-up, one-on-one lightsaber duels and killings? Why do you think that is? What makes more of an impact: violence or loss? Why? How does this movie handle both topics? How is diversity -- and a lack thereof -- used to indicate the values of the opposing sides of the conflict in the Star Wars series? Why is it notable that the First Order has very little diversity, while the Republic has a lot of it? Talk about the themes from the previous movies that repeat themselves here. Why are issues of good vs. evil, mentorship, and so on so important to this series? How do they play out on-screen? What are your thoughts on the way the Skywalker Saga ended? What do you think happens in the future for the characters, the Force, and the galaxy?

"Dec 19, 2019","        As Rey (Daisy Ridley) faces Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in battle, she's in danger of joining the dark side.  Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) pursuades Kylo Ren to try to kill Rey, the Last Jedi. Meanwhile, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and three droids join her in her battles against Kylo Ren and to help her to locate Emperor Palpatine.         Writer/director J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio do a great job of keep the plot coherent, for the most part, and of introducing the characters with just the right amount of exposition. Key plot points get repeated at least twice so that there's no confusion. If you're the kind of audience member who doesn't like their hand held tightly, so-to-speak, by a film without much room for nuance or interpretation, this isn't the kind of film for you. There are a few moments of comic relief, but they're far and few between. The dialogue occasionally sounds stilted and unintentionally funny, and the film feels like it's merely going through the motions more often than not. You can feel the wheels of the screenplay turning at every frame.          To be fair, though, who watches Star Wars expecting lots of realistic dialogue and lengthy conversations? This isn't meant to be a slice of life; it's a slice of cake. Fans enjoy seeing their favorite characters in action along with a compelling plot all of which can be found here. Of course, just like in any blockbuster, there's a MacGuffin, in this case the Sith Wayfinder which Rey needs to tracks down Palpatine. What she really wants, though, is to learn about her origins and who she really is. When someone asks her what's her full name, she just says Rey, so it's that subplot that adds a modicum of substance to all the spectacle. The major surprises here come in the form of cameos, so none of them will be spoiled here.          Fortunately, what elevates Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker  are the performances which are very committed. Daisy Ridley is a natural talent and rises above the material to add some much-needed emotion. Oscar Isaac and John Boyega, who's still reminiscent of a young Denzel Washington, are also superb. The real stars of the film are the CGI effects and the score by John Williams which provide plenty of eye and ear candy along the way even during the less engaging scenes. The filmmakers don't really take any risks when it comes to filmmaking techniques or anything else for that matter, so by playing it safe, the film never rises above mediocrity. At a running time of 2 hours and 35 minutes,  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker  isn't among the best of the Star Wars franchise, but it has just enough exhilarating thrills, strong performances and impressive visual effects to be a mildly entertaining, harmless Spectacle.

"Dec 19, 2019"," La saga que iniciÃ³ en 1977 al fin llega a su fin con Star Wars El Ascenso de Skywalker. Te decimos si le hace justicia en nuestra reseÃ±a sin spoilers. Nunca es fÃ¡cil terminar una saga icÃ³nica y menos cuando se trata de una que marcÃ³ a varias generaciones a lo largo de casi cuatro dÃ©cadas. Con Star Wars El Ascenso de Skywalker, J.J. Abrams tenÃ­a la gran responsabilidad de concluir con esta guerra intergalÃ¡ctica entre el bien y el mal. DespuÃ©s de un aÃ±o de los acontecimientos de Los Ãltimos Jedi, esta pelÃ­cula capta a nuestros hÃ©roes preparÃ¡ndose para la Ãºltima batalla. Sobre todo porque (sÃ­) el Emperador Palpatine estÃ¡ de regreso y planea apoderarse de todo. QuizÃ¡s no hay fandom mÃ¡s aguerrido que el que rodea a la franquicia creada por George Lucas en el lejano 1977. Es por ello que no importa el resultado, ningÃºn final lograrÃ¡ realmente complacer a todos. J.J. Abrams lo sabÃ­a e hizo su lucha presentando una cinta que parece querer darle gusto a los fans mÃ¡s que cerrar un ciclo de manera redonda. Como resultado, Star Wars El Ascenso de Skywalker es entretenida, con sorprendentes visuales, batallas con sables lÃ¡ser y muchos (demasiados) personajes. Abrams intenta dar respuesta a muchas de las interrogantes pasadas demasiado rÃ¡pido y, mientras aborda algunas que parecÃ­an ya no tener relevancia âcomo quiÃ©nes son los padres de Reyâ, ignora por completo otras que sÃ­ eran importantes (como los caballeros de Ren). Lo que mÃ¡s lamentamos es que, al emprender este maratÃ³n de explicaciones, Abrams sacrificÃ³ la humanidad y esencia de varios personajes y los nuevos, como Jannah y Zorii Bliss, parecen estar ahÃ­ solo de relleno. AdemÃ¡s, hay momentos en que pasan cosas muy impresionantes, pero no hay tiempo para lidiar con ellas, ya que la trama y los involucrados pasan rÃ¡pidamente al siguiente problema. En cuanto a Rey y Kylo Ren, desde El Despertar de la Fuerza sabÃ­amos que sus caminos estaban destinados a cruzarse, pero es hasta Star Wars El Ascenso de Skywalker que realmente entendemos la complejidad de su rivalidad. Algunas de las escenas mÃ¡s emocionantes de la cinta corren a cuenta de sus enfrentamientos. Hay que reconocerlo, J.J. Abrams debiÃ³ aprender una sola cosa de Rian Johnson: arriesgarse. Al final, se siente como si hubiera decidido desaprovechar todas las posibilidades que se destaparon con la pelÃ­cula previa y simplemente basarse en una fÃ³rmula ya probada, pero no siempre bien lograda. De lo bueno, podemos decir que Star Wars El Ascenso de SkywalkerÂ tiene momentos de risa, tensiÃ³n, drama, muchas emociones y, lo mÃ¡s importante, cierra el legado de los Skywalker.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",The Rise of Skywalker could be described as a mere compendium of betrayals it commits against itself.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," “The dead talk!” begins the opening crawl of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the ninth and — apparently — final entry in the original “Skywalker Saga.” The talking dead refers to evil emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who seemingly died at the end of “Return of the Jedi,” but has been hiding all this time in a secret Sith lair, orchestrating everything. It effectively explains why 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” so closely mirrored the original 1977 “Star Wars.” They were designed by the same architect. Wrapping up a 42-year-old series as popular and beloved as this one is no cakewalk, and, for “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” director-co-writer J.J. Abrams opts for completeness rather than pacing. Getting to Palpatine’s hiding place requires obtaining one of two pyramid-shaped gizmos. Kylo finds the first, and a great deal of time and effort are spent finding the second. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training with Gen. Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, appearing courtesy outtakes from “The Force Awakens” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”). And heroes Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) are off getting intelligence from a spy that has infiltrated the evil First Order. The news isn’t good: Palpatine plans to start destroying planets in less than a day’s time, thereby establishing the sinister-sounding “Final Order.” Stopping him requires jumping through many hoops as well as enriching each new character’s history, and making callbacks to almost every other character that’s ever appeared in a “Star Wars” film. Happily, one of them is Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), as smooth and cool as ever. It’s his first time in the role in 36 years, since 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” perhaps a record. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (“Argo”), working from their story with Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, come up with spectacular scenes, including a planet containing a massive fragment of fallen Death Star surrounded by harrowing, hundred-foot waves. There also are fun new characters, such as a masked warrior played by Keri Russell and a cute new droid. But much of the running time is spent traveling, and there may be one too many lightsaber battles, leading to fidgeting and watch-checking after about 90 minutes. Although “The Rise of Skywalker” is 11 minutes shorter than Rian Johnson’s 2017 “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” — perhaps the best of this trilogy, thanks to pacing, wit and smarts — it feels much longer. “The Last Jedi” was infamously attacked by some fans, presumably for adding gray area into the concept of The Force and/or adding diverse female characters and the cute Porg. Abrams sidelines or smooths over those ideas in “The Rise of Skywalker.” Like any great, long-running series, the identifiable, lovable characters — who in the audience doesn’t feel a misfit sometimes? — are key. And even if Abrams takes the long way around to eventually say goodbye to them, the goodbye itself is everything anyone could have asked for.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","While the film is certainly messy and manic, fans should take a breath and see it for themselves -- there's a lot to like (and even love) in The Rise of Skywalker.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," The ninth, and allegedly final, instalment of the central Star Wars saga — started by George Lucas a long time ago, in a Disney-free galaxy far, far away — has arrived, and it has a whole lot of explaining to do. At least according to legions of mildly puzzled fans, anyway, and returning director JJ Abrams, whose primary skill continues to be servicing their every desire. Editor note: There are no spoilers for the film below, but if you're planning to go in completely clean, now's the time to back out. Just how did the First Order rise from the ashes of a resoundingly defeated Empire? What really happened with Luke Skywalker and the Knights of Ren? Who are Rey's parents, like really, for real this time? Does middle-aged Jedi astral projection come with a Just for Men kit included? What if the Jedi and the Sith were simply tired old notions, like good and evil, and a new generation — duelling, star-crossed acolytes Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — were able to wipe clean the mistakes of their predecessors? JJ Abrams' return to the creative seat is good news for those who stubbornly oppose such change, but bad for anyone who suspects he's been running low on original ideas this entire time. Some may be left wondering why — apart from rewarding Disney shareholders — this story, which abandoned Lucas' radical ideas in favour of insidious nostalgia, needed to be told in the first place. ""The dead speak!"" shrieks the trademark opening crawl. It's no spoiler to report — since his puppeteering presence has been a major selling point of the film's trailers — that ""the phantom emperor"" Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is back dipping into his old bag of tricks, biding his time and hanging out in some sorcerous netherworld to orchestrate the end of the Resistance and the rise of what he calls the Final Order. Not only did the Sith Lord survive Return of the Jedi's then-fatal tumble down the second Death Star's power chute, his smooth skin seems to suggest he's discovered some good, evil moisturiser, even if his eyes are now an eerie, zombie white. With more lives than a soap opera villain, Palpatine beckons conflicted Supreme Leader Kylo Ren into doing his bidding, with an offer to resurrect the Empire and rule the galaxy. ""I have been every voice you've ever heard inside your head,"" he taunts the young Sith, who busies himself rebuilding his Vader-lite cosplay and wreaking havoc in his quest to find grandpa's old master. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Resistance are racing across the galaxy and, at a makeshift base on another forested planet, we find Rey levitating and training under her new master, Princess Leia, played by the late Carrie Fisher via seamlessly resculpted but rather dramatically inert footage left over from 2015's The Force Awakens. The Rise of Skywalker is a film in one hell of a hurry, with early passages hurtling along at light-speed, making the dramatic spaces of The Last Jedi seem like Ozu by comparison. Abrams' knack for overlapping, yappy dialogue and spirited performances is front and centre, but the movie also feels like a story racing away from its unruly tangents and back toward safety. It's almost as though The Last Jedi didn't need to exist. That sense of course correction becomes explicit in certain moments and decisions that seem designed to placate fans on every side of the debate, a move that tends to dilute anything bold or original The Rise of Skywalker might have to offer. Where The Last Jedi dared suggest a world beyond good and evil, and set out to fulfil the original trilogy's promise of full-blown new age mysticism with interdimensional projection, Abrams' film ensures the old conflicts are reassuringly reinstated. He also resorts to his worst tendencies as a storyteller: an overload of ultimately redundant plot points, bait-and-switches, and puzzle clues that superficially propel the film along but don't allow for the development of any resonant, overarching emotional threads. It's plot at the expense of story. Thus a search for a ""Sith wayfinder"", a tracking clue so banal it may as well be Dark Side GPS, begets a similar-feeling series of detours and chases, with visits to another desert planet (with a colourful festival of ancient aliens), an encounter with one of Poe's (Oscar Isaacs) old bounty hunter flames (Keri Russell, stuck in a Daft Punk helmet), and a chance encounter with Lando Calrissian (the great Billy Dee Williams, wasted but for his utterance of the series' running joke about bad feelings). New characters are tossed into an overcrowded mix — a spirited, though underused ex-Imperial resistance fighter, Jannah (Naomi Rickie), First Order heavy Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant, fun but fleeting), and an aggressively pointless droid, D-0 — while others (R2-D2, Kelly Marie Tran's Rose) feel neglected or outright mishandled (the level of disrespect shown to C-3PO in this movie is relentless and, frankly, depressing.) Blink and you'll miss the franchise's long-promised queer moment, a background kiss buried so deep in the tail-end commotion that it can be easily, cynically excised for offended markets. Despite the usual banquet of visual effects, including menacing flotillas of Star Destroyers, Millennium Falcon hyperspace jaunts and a subterranean worm that feels like a grouchy cousin to the Rancor, the overpowering business of the plot becomes strangely enervating. Even the reliable, heart-tugging emotional cues — John Williams' punchy score, Chewbacca's plaintive howl, and the inevitable cameos from old friends long gone — lack the magic, though not for want of Abrams' best exertions to render things epic and moving. Ridley and Driver, especially, continue to shine, even if their characters haven't been developed to a satisfying extent. The film falls back on the old tropes of shifting Force allegiances, and the resolution of their intertwined journey labours a big moment that should otherwise have brought down the house. Dropping ancestral reveals has long been one of the Star Wars' series favourite ploys, and The Rise of Skywalker differs only its relative ridiculousness — or creative desperation. When the film quite literally revisits the turf of Return of the Jedi — a showdown between Kylo and Rey in the wreckage of the second Death Star's Throne Room, which somehow managed to retain parts of its structure despite being blown to a million pieces by the Rebel fleet — it's fatally apparent that Abrams is spinning his wheels, and the gestures made by Johnson's film are but a memory. With the Disney+ series The Mandalorian proving a hit with audiences, while still operating firmly within the shadow Lucas' formative original films, perhaps the eager-to-please, undeniably spectacular Rise of Skywalker will be enough for some. Yet even in the unjustly maligned prequels, Lucas gave us new worlds, expansive, unified visions, and a desire to push the limits of technology. The Rise of Skywalker merely reaffirms its dedication to serving up a jukebox of greatest hits designed to extend the corporate brand and sell tickets to Disney theme parks. For one of pop cinema's once most thrilling playgrounds, it's a grim future that's becoming hard to embrace.

"Dec 19, 2019"," WADE MAJOR: Seeing as how we have all grown up and become adults and now film critics over the ridiculous 42-year span it has taken to create the complete 9-film arc originally (allegedly) conceived by George Lucas, a CineGods Tomato Slam of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker seems only appropriate. So let me get us into it by stating just in broad terms that I have never been a mad fan of all things Star Wars. I liked the original film — which was the last movie I saw with my father before he passed — and I love The Empire Strikes Back. I haven’t really liked anything Star Wars since that time, and I found the last two to be derivative at best and turgid fan service at worst. The Force Awakens was “Yeah, fine, scratch the itch, been there, done that, whatever.” The Last Jedi was “What the hell was the point of that?” And this, for me, is, “Glad you got that out of your system — thank God that’s over, can we please now move on?” RAY GREENE: It is relevant that I haven’t seen the movie yet — and that I may not see a Star Wars movie in a movie theatre for the first time in 42 years.  I find myself deeply disinterested in all things Star Wars after all the alt-right Reddit screeching that greeted The Last Jedi’s rather mild steps toward inclusive casting. The bad taste of all that has lingered for me, and Disney’s recent groveling to all the haters in the lead up to The Rise of Skywalker hasn’t improved my mood. It is really relevant to say this: Star Trek integrated space just over a decade before there was even a FIRST film called Star Wars — so why get uptight if there’s an Asian heroine integrated into the Star Wars crew? It was overdue. But it is in a sense unsurprising for an appreciable percentage of Star Wars fans to be borderline white nationalist yahoos, given the reactionary nature of pathological fandom, the quasi-religious undertones of the whole Force thing, and the anti-democratic drift of the whole Star Wars enterprise after the original’s wild success 42 years ago. Luke Skywalker was initially presented as an everyman, and his heroism in his first appearance was that of a gifted average guy rising to the call of larger challenges and great events — Lincoln with a lightsaber. When Luke was revealed to be Vader’s son instead of the spawn of a dirt poor farmer on an intergalactic backwater, most of that went out the window. Luke’s gift became one of bloodline, epitomizing that most dangerous of myths: a genetic superiority. The whole geek debate over Midichlorians is even more disturbing when you delve into the official lore — it turns out Anakin Skywalker (aka Vader) was genetically-engineered for glory by Emperor Palpatine — a Hitlerian fantasy if ever there was one. Ew. In the slavish re-enactments spearheaded by J.J. and company, genetic supremacy continues to be the order of the day. Kylo Ren is Leia’s kid, and Leia is another Vader offspring, so it’s basically a trope at this point that a supreme ability with the Force can only be achieved by DNA. And even though Rian Johnson tried to throw that idea overboard in Last Jedi (and has since been rebuked for it by Abrams), Daisy Ridley’s Rey has always seemed to be on the verge of finding out she’s SOMEBODY’s Force-filled love child. [SPOILER ALERT: She is]. This idea that greatness is genetically transmitted through the blood is actually a pretty appalling mass fantasy for an allegedly democratic society — especially one that seems to be re-litigating so many of its core ideals in the Trump era.  Also: the Disneyfication of Star Wars that has been creeping over the whole enterprise like an artificial moon ever since Lucas sold out his baby reached a zenith in the Han Solo origin story, which played like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes with Wookies for me.  Then there’s that narrative. Long, meandering and constantly looping back onto itself — which is less fan service than just a lack of cleverness. Or maybe, on the heels of Solo, the deliberate avoidance of cleverness. No freaky robots. At least Lando is rehabilitated. I was just glad Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon and Jar-Jar didn’t show up. Cuz every-freaking-body else does.  RAY GREENE: Good points, Tim. I would add that Spileberg and Lucas were members of that New Hollywood generation, which paid a lot of lip service to personal expression, and even their most popcorn commercial achievements are idiosyncratic ones for the most part (I think Spielberg really grew as a filmmaker too, in ways Lucas could not manage). In contrast, J.J. is what I sometimes call a fauxteur. He’s hired because he has no personal signature to impart, and will slavishly emulate some corporately acceptable definition of a prior achievement by pumping it up with the various heliums that have accrued to action filmmaking in the interim between the original and the now. That’s not filmmaking — it’s air traffic control. Slight aside: I’ve come to hate the J.J. Star Trek movies, which are mostly parade grounds for overstuffed action set pieces with a shvitz of character development sprayed on top and no discernible subtext. Star Trek was frequently all about the subtext, aka the ideas embedded in the sci fi in that old-school John Campbell way. The J.J. approach suits Star Wars far more than it ever could fit Star Trek. because action is more central to the Lucas approach than it ever was for Gene Roddenberry. Lucas wanted to recreate the comic book space opera of Flash Gordon, where Roddenberry was hiring legit sci fi authors like Harlan Ellison and Larry Niven to write his scripts. MARK KEIZER: Ray’s unbelievably incisive, surprising and depressing conclusion that greatness in the Star Wars universe is a matter of bloodline not youth+talent+opportunity has me hating the entire lot of films. But I’m going to use a Jedi mind trick on myself and fall back in love with a series that is, let’s face it, batting 2 for 9; 4 for 9 if I’m being generous. When it comes to Rey’s lineage, no spoilers here, the problem is not that JJ is advocating for the benefits of genetic superiority. The problem, if a Disney shareholder would even consider this a problem, is that J.J. understands that fans don’t want Rey to be revealed as a nobody from nowhere with anonymous, unimportant lineage. Indeed, the revealing of Rey’s identity is the only thing that has kept me going since The Force Awakens. Finn’s beginnings as a defector Stormtrooper was a promising idea that was never developed. Poe was positioned as Han Solo: The Sequel but that idea died in the crib. As a character, he’s a big zero. Not that the original Han Solo was a three-dimension reflection of contemporary America, but the force of Harrison Ford’s charm and humor covered up a lot of what wasn’t there. Anyway, the question of Rey’s lineage, as the only enduring mystery of the new trilogy, has to be resolved in a way that feels large and exciting and worth the wait. Their answer is arbitrary, convenient and yet, somehow, fine, which is in line with J.J.’s script (co-written with Chris Terrio), which is similarly arbitrary, convenient and yet, somehow, fine. RAY GREENE: See, this is what’s depressing: “J.J. understands that fans don’t want Rey to be revealed as a nobody from nowhere with anonymous, unimportant lineage.” Because Mark, I suspect you’re right that that’s the thinking (or rather the groupthink, since J.J. allegedly did his due diligence by reading up on the internet fan reaction to The Last Jedi). But lineage? That’s at best a British idea and at worst a Nazi one.  Lack of lineage is a core creation myth for previous generations of American pulp heroes, including but not limited to Flash Gordon (the alleged inspiration for both Luke and Han), Buck Rogers, Batman, The Shadow, Will Eisner’s the Spirit, Billy Batson aka SHAZAM, Plastic Man, James Tiberius Kirk, Batgirl, the Fantastic Four and the Hulk. Admittedly, comic books in particular have frequently played around with the idea of genetic superiority (Seigel and Shuster allegedly invented Superman in large part as a corrective to all that evil rhetoric coming out of Hitler’s Germany about master races and Aryan supermen), hence Superman, Wonder Woman, Thor and every single X-man (or X-woman).

"Dec 19, 2019"," WADE MAJOR: Seeing as how we have all grown up and become adults and now film critics over the ridiculous 42-year span it has taken to create the complete 9-film arc originally (allegedly) conceived by George Lucas, a CineGods Tomato Slam of Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker seems only appropriate. So let me get us into it by stating just in broad terms that I have never been a mad fan of all things Star Wars. I liked the original film — which was the last movie I saw with my father before he passed — and I love The Empire Strikes Back. I haven’t really liked anything Star Wars since that time, and I found the last two to be derivative at best and turgid fan service at worst. The Force Awakens was “Yeah, fine, scratch the itch, been there, done that, whatever.” The Last Jedi was “What the hell was the point of that?” And this, for me, is, “Glad you got that out of your system — thank God that’s over, can we please now move on?” RAY GREENE: It is relevant that I haven’t seen the movie yet — and that I may not see a Star Wars movie in a movie theatre for the first time in 42 years.  I find myself deeply disinterested in all things Star Wars after all the alt-right Reddit screeching that greeted The Last Jedi’s rather mild steps toward inclusive casting. The bad taste of all that has lingered for me, and Disney’s recent groveling to all the haters in the lead up to The Rise of Skywalker hasn’t improved my mood. It is really relevant to say this: Star Trek integrated space just over a decade before there was even a FIRST film called Star Wars — so why get uptight if there’s an Asian heroine integrated into the Star Wars crew? It was overdue. But it is in a sense unsurprising for an appreciable percentage of Star Wars fans to be borderline white nationalist yahoos, given the reactionary nature of pathological fandom, the quasi-religious undertones of the whole Force thing, and the anti-democratic drift of the whole Star Wars enterprise after the original’s wild success 42 years ago. Luke Skywalker was initially presented as an everyman, and his heroism in his first appearance was that of a gifted average guy rising to the call of larger challenges and great events — Lincoln with a lightsaber. When Luke was revealed to be Vader’s son instead of the spawn of a dirt poor farmer on an intergalactic backwater, most of that went out the window. Luke’s gift became one of bloodline, epitomizing that most dangerous of myths: a genetic superiority. The whole geek debate over Midichlorians is even more disturbing when you delve into the official lore — it turns out Anakin Skywalker (aka Vader) was genetically-engineered for glory by Emperor Palpatine — a Hitlerian fantasy if ever there was one. Ew. In the slavish re-enactments spearheaded by J.J. and company, genetic supremacy continues to be the order of the day. Kylo Ren is Leia’s kid, and Leia is another Vader offspring, so it’s basically a trope at this point that a supreme ability with the Force can only be achieved by DNA. And even though Rian Johnson tried to throw that idea overboard in Last Jedi (and has since been rebuked for it by Abrams), Daisy Ridley’s Rey has always seemed to be on the verge of finding out she’s SOMEBODY’s Force-filled love child. [SPOILER ALERT: She is]. This idea that greatness is genetically transmitted through the blood is actually a pretty appalling mass fantasy for an allegedly democratic society — especially one that seems to be re-litigating so many of its core ideals in the Trump era.  Also: the Disneyfication of Star Wars that has been creeping over the whole enterprise like an artificial moon ever since Lucas sold out his baby reached a zenith in the Han Solo origin story, which played like The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes with Wookies for me.  Then there’s that narrative. Long, meandering and constantly looping back onto itself — which is less fan service than just a lack of cleverness. Or maybe, on the heels of Solo, the deliberate avoidance of cleverness. No freaky robots. At least Lando is rehabilitated. I was just glad Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon and Jar-Jar didn’t show up. Cuz every-freaking-body else does.  RAY GREENE: Good points, Tim. I would add that Spileberg and Lucas were members of that New Hollywood generation, which paid a lot of lip service to personal expression, and even their most popcorn commercial achievements are idiosyncratic ones for the most part (I think Spielberg really grew as a filmmaker too, in ways Lucas could not manage). In contrast, J.J. is what I sometimes call a fauxteur. He’s hired because he has no personal signature to impart, and will slavishly emulate some corporately acceptable definition of a prior achievement by pumping it up with the various heliums that have accrued to action filmmaking in the interim between the original and the now. That’s not filmmaking — it’s air traffic control. Slight aside: I’ve come to hate the J.J. Star Trek movies, which are mostly parade grounds for overstuffed action set pieces with a shvitz of character development sprayed on top and no discernible subtext. Star Trek was frequently all about the subtext, aka the ideas embedded in the sci fi in that old-school John Campbell way. The J.J. approach suits Star Wars far more than it ever could fit Star Trek. because action is more central to the Lucas approach than it ever was for Gene Roddenberry. Lucas wanted to recreate the comic book space opera of Flash Gordon, where Roddenberry was hiring legit sci fi authors like Harlan Ellison and Larry Niven to write his scripts. MARK KEIZER: Ray’s unbelievably incisive, surprising and depressing conclusion that greatness in the Star Wars universe is a matter of bloodline not youth+talent+opportunity has me hating the entire lot of films. But I’m going to use a Jedi mind trick on myself and fall back in love with a series that is, let’s face it, batting 2 for 9; 4 for 9 if I’m being generous. When it comes to Rey’s lineage, no spoilers here, the problem is not that JJ is advocating for the benefits of genetic superiority. The problem, if a Disney shareholder would even consider this a problem, is that J.J. understands that fans don’t want Rey to be revealed as a nobody from nowhere with anonymous, unimportant lineage. Indeed, the revealing of Rey’s identity is the only thing that has kept me going since The Force Awakens. Finn’s beginnings as a defector Stormtrooper was a promising idea that was never developed. Poe was positioned as Han Solo: The Sequel but that idea died in the crib. As a character, he’s a big zero. Not that the original Han Solo was a three-dimension reflection of contemporary America, but the force of Harrison Ford’s charm and humor covered up a lot of what wasn’t there. Anyway, the question of Rey’s lineage, as the only enduring mystery of the new trilogy, has to be resolved in a way that feels large and exciting and worth the wait. Their answer is arbitrary, convenient and yet, somehow, fine, which is in line with J.J.’s script (co-written with Chris Terrio), which is similarly arbitrary, convenient and yet, somehow, fine. RAY GREENE: See, this is what’s depressing: “J.J. understands that fans don’t want Rey to be revealed as a nobody from nowhere with anonymous, unimportant lineage.” Because Mark, I suspect you’re right that that’s the thinking (or rather the groupthink, since J.J. allegedly did his due diligence by reading up on the internet fan reaction to The Last Jedi). But lineage? That’s at best a British idea and at worst a Nazi one.  Lack of lineage is a core creation myth for previous generations of American pulp heroes, including but not limited to Flash Gordon (the alleged inspiration for both Luke and Han), Buck Rogers, Batman, The Shadow, Will Eisner’s the Spirit, Billy Batson aka SHAZAM, Plastic Man, James Tiberius Kirk, Batgirl, the Fantastic Four and the Hulk. Admittedly, comic books in particular have frequently played around with the idea of genetic superiority (Seigel and Shuster allegedly invented Superman in large part as a corrective to all that evil rhetoric coming out of Hitler’s Germany about master races and Aryan supermen), hence Superman, Wonder Woman, Thor and every single X-man (or X-woman). But in America, we believe greatness is available to everybody don’t we? Or has the yoke been so tightly bolted to the collective neck that we don’t even dream we can each be great any more? I’ll just add that when Tim and I first talked, he rightly said that Joseph Campbell would totally approve of what’s going on here — and that wasn’t an endorsement. That was an acknowledgement that this is strictly by-the-numbers myth-making and, as previously noted, “fan service.” But Mark has often raised an excellent qualifier for sequels, which is “if this weren’t a sequel but the first film of a franchise, would it be popular?” which is another way of saying, “If this weren’t larded to the gills with fan service calling back all their emotions for previous, better movies, would there be anything original, innate or self-contained in the film that is worth a lick?” WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE PEOPLE THINKING? Did NOBODY at LucasFilm or Disney raise their hand and scream, “Uh, no! You can’t get away with that! No screenwriting professor in any film school in America would tolerate that! FAIL!” Apparently not. And that’s inexcusable. How does J.J. not recognize what an unbelievably sloppy cheat that is? How do they not plan this out before the first film even shoots a frame?  And by way of another gripe — with spoilers — this may be “a long time ago” in a galaxy “far away” but if these people can blast around the galaxy at light speed and build sentient, autonomous robots… they can surely figure out a way to back up C3PO’s memory other than to R2D2 who isn’t around so that we can throw in a cheap sequence of “amnesia” gags that aren’t the least bit funny. If something went boo-boo with my iPhone, it is already backing up everywhere, all the time. So no, I’m not buying that “OMG! To get our galaxy-saving translation of an ancient text on a dagger we conveniently found in the dirt, the price we will pay is (possibly) forever losing our friend C3PO because his only backup is in R2D2 who is unreliable (yeah, not really).” What utter nonsense. And that whole “we have a spy in the First Order!” subplot? Did it serve to go anywhere? No. It was a cheap plot contrivance that was paid off with an even cheaper and totally unearned joke. I don’t mean to say that this is a garbage film, but it’s not a good film. It’s a lazy, sloppy, presumptuous movie that shows no respect whatsoever for fans. It assumes Star Wars fans are drooling, mindless tools who simply want more of what they’ve already been fed ad nauseum for decades — and so it refuses to challenge them or push the storyline into organic new areas precisely because THE FANS and their stiff expectations are what’s now driving the creative train. The inmates have taken over the asylum and the movie studio.  Two final thoughts — firstly, this is the problem with allowing a franchise to metastasize over the course of decades — the longer you allow the narrative to go unfulfilled, the longer you let fan expectations percolate, the bigger and more daunting the challenge of satisfying their expectations. If you keep them hanging for a few years, they will gladly buy whatever you sell them. But if you leave them hanging for decades? Now they evolve their own expectations — and you’re increasingly hamstrung by them at the expense of truly original narrative risk-taking.

And at that stage, no franchise can prevail — you’re doomed.  Lastly, to Ray’s point about the over-dependence on lineage — this is an admittedly literary device, an appeal to the Shakespearean notion of generational struggle which is, itself, an extension of the “divine right of kings” so central to European history and its literary output for centuries. Joseph Campbell would no doubt appreciate that, too. But I don’t. Ultimately, we are left, at the end of nine films, with what is not so much the story of individual destiny and the power of individuals — any individuals — to make a difference in the universe, to achieve greatness and destiny no matter how humble their circumstances — oh, no. That’s not this franchise. Nobody really achieves their destiny in Star Wars unless they come from two great houses of lineage — like an interstellar version of The War of the Roses — the House of Lancaster versus the House of York.

"Dec 19, 2019"," EWTN News, Inc. is the world’s largest Catholic news organization, comprised of television, radio,
                print and digital media outlets, dedicated to reporting the truth in light of the Gospel and the
                Catholic Church. Five films into the Disney era of Star Wars, with a completed third trilogy ostensibly bringing the Skywalker saga to an end, there are two conflicting ideas — neither of which, as yet, definitively has the upper hand. One vision immerses us in a warm bath of nostalgia; another dashes revisionistic cold water in our faces. The former is a gauzy slideshow tour of well-known characters and types, locations, images, themes and story beats; the latter, a demolition project in the pursuit of renovation, of change and growth. J.J. Abrams’ Episode VII — The Force Awakens, which kicked off the new era, drew so schematically on the first Star Wars that it was practically a remake. This was soothing balm, perhaps, for some of those smarting from the clumsy blunders of the prequel trilogy (“This will begin to set things right”), but my kids were among those who left the theater complaining that The Force Awakens “stole too much.” Rian Johnson apparently agreed with that critique, since his iconoclastic Episode VIII — The Last Jedi was a virtual antithesis to The Force Awakens, making the argument for killing Star Wars nostalgia to save Star Wars (“Let the past die”). This came on the heels of the moral complications of Rogue One, which cast Rebellion fighters as “spies, saboteurs, and assassins” engaged in terroristic acts. From the bitterly disillusioned Luke dismissively tossing his lightsaber over his shoulder to the abrupt dispatching of Andy Serkis’ Supreme Leader “We Hardly Knew Ye” Snoke — and especially the provocative idea that Daisy Ridley’s massively powerful Rey was of no notable parentage — The Last Jedi virtually blew smoke in the face of its predecessor at every turn. (Not to mention the faces of its outraged fans.) Of course, The Force Awakens itself had similarly subverted Return of the Jedi by effectively canceling the victory party and restoring the status quo (with only the slightest rebranding) of a powerful Sith-led Shmempire versus a heroic underdog Shmebellion. Now Abrams is back to “set things right” again in Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker — that is, to yank the rug from under The Last Jedi just as The Last Jedi did to The Force Awakens, and to an extent as The Force Awakens did to Return of the Jedi. Was Adam Driver’s villainous Kylo Ren, aka Ben Solo, goaded to grow beyond his idolization of Darth Vader and smash the helmet that he never actually needed? It has been remade. Is the Emperor surrogate Snoke dead? The opening crawl (it can’t be a spoiler if it’s in the crawl) teases the mysterious return of the ultimate Emperor surrogate surrogate: the man himself, Palpatine redivivus (Ian McDiarmid), who, like Sauron or Voldemort, seems hard to kill for good. As for Rey’s parentage — look, I’ll just say that, wherever the pendulum winds up, whatever you think of how Johnson played his own card there, Abrams’ response carries almost no emotional weight. Both approaches have their advocates, and I sympathize with both. (Both warm baths and cold water in the face have their place in the world.) If I don’t take sides, that’s because I think the hard reality is that The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi each hover, in different but comparable ways, between competence and mediocrity. The Force Awakens has no surprises or new ideas, and The Last Jedi is more interested in subverting expectations than in telling a good story. Star Wars at its best is both creative and daring in its pursuit of new narrative possibilities and dramatic revelations and nostalgic in its values of archetypal good vs. archetypal evil, especially in its celebration of the power of love, family, spirituality and even, sometimes, nonviolence. Would either Abramsesque nostalgia or Johnsonesque iconoclasm have come up with the mythic revelations of The Empire Strikes Back (“No, Luke, I am your father”) or Return of the Jedi (the redemption of Darth Vader)? I doubt it. At any rate, the narrative tug-of-war over the last few installments means that there are limits to how satisfying The Rise of Skywalker as the conclusion of this trilogy of trilogies could possibly be. There’s also a limit, probably, to how bad it can be. Abrams still knows how to deliver spectacle and action as well as nostalgia, which is a heck of a drug. Let’s face it, they could play John Williams’ ominous “Imperial March” over scenes of Uncle Deadly from the Muppets lobbing Green Goblin pumpkin-bombs at Scrat the saber-squirrel (I mean, they literally could, legally, and you could watch it on Disney+ forever and ever), and many of us would still feel emotions stir. Just as The Force Awakens pedantically emulated A New Hope, Rise is out to evoke Return of the Jedi at every turn, down to familiar locations and of course the Emperor himself. There’s a new twist on the not entirely coherent idea from Jedi that tempting you to strike him down is how the Emperor wins — and it ties into the one new idea in Rise. It is an actual spiritual idea about the Force and the Jedi, and like much of Star Wars mysticism it could be given either a more New Age-y reading or a more Christian reading. Either way, it isn’t given enough attention or expressed powerfully enough to be very interesting or important. Rise not only suffers from the same risk-aversion and over-familiarity as The Force Awakens, it’s also all too obviously working to re-reverse all its predecessor’s reversals. Some of these involve transparent pandering to pressure from fans. The unhappiest example is sidelining Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, whose odd relationship with John Boyega’s ex-stormtrooper Finn was one of the more promising elements of Last Jedi, but whose unpopularity with some fans crossed into vicious racist and sexist trolling of Tran. It doesn’t help that Rey, Finn and Poe were never as well-defined as Luke, Leia and Han. Since each film in this new trilogy was evidently meant to highlight one of that original triad — first Han, then Luke, and finally Leia — Carrie Fisher’s death is another blow that the filmmakers work around as gracefully as possible, working around whatever deleted footage they had and fudging the rest in various ways. Last Jedi teased us with the question of whether Ben Solo would be turned back to the good side or whether Rey could possibly be turned to the dark side. With Johnson at the helm, nothing seemed off the table. With Abrams back … I mean, draw your own conclusions. Abrams even seems bent on undoing his own actions, on avoiding meaningful narrative choices of any kind. Again and again he seems to cross a line only to backtrack, until it becomes comical. Perhaps the film’s one real creative goal is not to alienate or upset anyone, which sometimes means alienating everyone. (Even the target audience for a fleeting same-sex kiss may be unhappy about how carefully it’s downplayed in the background of a crowded, celebratory reunion scene.) It’s a film not only at war with its predecessor but also with itself. This eventually becomes a fatal problem as it becomes clear that Abrams has no clear idea how or why good triumphs over evil. George Lucas’ conceit in the original Star Wars was that Imperial military-industrial groupthink discounted the power of the individual. In Return of the Jedi, the power of love proved stronger than the dark side (and low-tech indigenous resistance proved more creative and adaptable than technologically superior but less nimble imperial occupiers). Two ideas wrestle in Rise: Does good triumph over evil through the power of friendship or does everything come down to the awesomeness of special people from special families? I’m not saying it can’t be both, but Abrams trips over his two ideas and one of them falls flat before being crushed by the other one. The wrong one, in my opinion. The Star Wars saga has become too long and too vast for such a small set of closely related characters to exert such hegemony. At some point Shrinking World Syndrome becomes a moral problem, no matter how large or diverse the supporting cast is made. The prequel trilogy, wrongheaded and graceless, still has a kind of perverse integrity as well as a creative boldness and a spectacular visual inventiveness. The sequel trilogy goes down easier sip for sip, but there’s no overarching vision and even the individual films are less than the sum of their parts. Return of the Jedi is a movie with notable problems, but this new conclusion to the Skywalker saga, though far bigger in scope, is dwarfed emotionally by the earlier finale. If nothing else, The Rise of Skywalker should leave fans with new appreciation for the original trilogy’s least loved installment. There are more Star Wars Stories to come, and eventually, inevitably, there will be an Episode X, followed by XI and XII. Disney surrounds us and penetrates us. The Mouse will be with us always.

"Dec 19, 2019"," Adam Driver’s tortured villain Kylo Ren continues to be the most compelling figure floating through a galaxy long ago and far away. Brooding Ren, a.k.a. Ben Solo, isn’t the only source of exhilaration or intrigue in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (★★★☆☆), though he does provide an enthralling piece in the puzzling web of relationships traced throughout this final trilogy of films in the long-running Skywalker saga. Having murdered his father Han in The Force Awakens, then finding himself unable to pull the trigger on mother Leia in The Last Jedi, Ren now pursues scavenger-turned-Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) through the galaxy with murderous vigor. Yet, he seems to have the hots for her, and the feeling might be mutual. Connected through the Force, Ren and Rey tease and seduce one another as much as they cross lightsabers in battle, both face-to-face and in the shared psychic space where their separate environments converge. The effect of these meetings is always potent, as the sound drops, the two contrasting locations intersect via sharp editing and CGI, and the friction between the Rebels’ great hope Rey and evil First Order commander Ren sells whatever beat of exposition is currently on tap. Ridley and Driver play this tension with riveting ambiguity. Do Rey and Ren want to kill each other, kiss each other, turn each other? Also, given the series’ complicated romantic and familial history, might they be related? Rey notoriously knows next to nothing about her parents, except that they abandoned her on a desolate planet. Her brave and impetuous comrades in the Resistance — fighter commander Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), reformed Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), Rebel pilot Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) — don’t know. Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) doesn’t know. But somebody might know. Enter Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, perfectly repugnant in the role, as usual), the Sith lord last seen falling to his death in Return of the Jedi. “I have died before,” he croaks from some bleak, hidden planet, as the prima space gangsta apparently has just been biding his time, building what he calls the Final Order. The Rise of Skywalker, though more effectively streamlined than either of the two previous entries in the franchise, spends too much of its running time on the Rebels’ search for a device that can lead them to wherever Palpatine is hiding. Then, whether or not they find the MacGuffin, they must reach Palpatine and rise up against his Final Order — all while outrunning the First Order, now under the command of Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), and skirmishing every ten minutes with Ren and his black-caped Knights of Ren. J.J. Abrams, back at the helm after reinvigorating the franchise with The Force Awakens, then serving as executive producer on Rian Johnson’s busy followup The Last Jedi, juggles multiple plots and subplots adroitly, noticeably leaving a few out of rotation. Rose, who fought nobly beside her crush Finn in the previous installment, is mostly sidelined here. Finn might pick up another potential love interest in newly introduced resistance fighter Jannah (Naomi Ackie), or he might finally embrace his good bro Poe, whose leather bomber Finn still sports through hell or high water. The ambiguity act doesn’t work as well for Boyega and Isaac, but The Rise of Skywalker appears to offer Stormpilot shippers (and you know who you are) no definitive reason to jump ship. However, truth be told, when he’s not in the midst of a spectacular dogfight, Poe’s eyes most often are trained fondly on leader and mentor General Leia Organa, portrayed one last time by the late Carrie Fisher. The Princess plays a prominent role, with the clear assistance of visual effects, stand-ins, and digitally altered previously-shot footage. Still, a real performance emerges through the technical fog, and Leia’s meaning to the story and the series is not lost. She is a beacon of hope that there are more courageous souls out in the farflung, flyover regions of the galaxy willing to rise up against oppressors. The earned sense of nostalgia is strong with this one, and Abrams serves it well alongside lively action and dazzling scenery. The Rise of Skywalker captures the joy of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) copiloting the Millennium Falcon, the hard-won wisdom of Master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), the surprisingly moving depth of a Wookiee’s grief. And every thread, old and new, is joined in the central mystery of Rey and Ren, which drags on a little, but keeps the fire lit for future generations of high-flying, seafaring, nerf-herding, adventurers.

"Dec 19, 2019"," More than four decades after it began, the Skywalker saga comes to an end with this ninth episode, The Rise Of Skywalker. It’s not the end of all Star Wars, of course, as there are TV series and more spin-off movies in the pipeline, but this adventure does bring a close (of sorts) to the story of Luke Skywalker, evil Sith Emperor Palpatine, young Jedi Rey and characters such as Chewie, Finn, Poe, Leia, Kylo Ren and droids BB8, C3PO, and R2D2. While many fans will have revisited the most recent two instalments The Force Awakens (episode 7) and The Last Jedi (episode 8) in preparation for episode nine, it is actually the originalthree movies that this adventure harks back to the most. Director and co-writer JJ Abrams (with co-writer Chris Terrio) delivers a movie that plays like a greatest hits of Star Wars: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back and Return Of The Jedi, paying homage (and some knowing winks) to the movies that started it all and, dare we say it, remain the best three of the saga. Following the events of The Last Jedi, we find Rey (Ridley) completing her Jedi training under the watchful eye of Leia (Fisher, who sadly died before the movie was in production, her performance consisting of footage she had already filmed for the previous instalments). Meanwhile, Poe (Isaac), Finn (Boyega) and Chewie are aboard the Millenium Falcon, travelling across the galaxy to get information from a spy that will help the Resistance. Oh, and Kylo Ren (Driver) is also jetting about on a journey of his own – tracking down Sith leader Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is (barely) alive but has still managed to create a deadly fleet of ships to crush the good guys once and for all. There is a lot to love here, especially if you are a fan of the original trilogy, from the return of old characters (such as Billy Dee Williams’ Lando) to visits to remembered planets. Fisher gets a lot more screen time than you’d expect, and there are some good character arcs for Ridley’s Rey, who is finally finding strength in the Force, and the conflicted Kylo Ren (Driver giving another superb performance). But there are a few problems with this finale, too. Abrams, who also made The Force Awakens, abandons some of the more interesting threads from Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (such as the new young generation of wannabe fighters) and instead focuses on cameos and familiar emotional moments to tug at the heart strings. Poe is little more than a more suave Han Solo in this outing, Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose is almost forgotten, and even Finn is given little of note to do apart from wave a blaster about. While the same few actors (Billie Lourd, Dominic Monaghan, Greg Grunberg) regularly popping up at Leia’s base makes the world in this Star Wars feel a little small (where is everyone else?), there are some fun new additions to the cast, including Keri Russell’s Zorii Bliss and Richard E Grant’s First Order General Pride, as well as some neat surprises that we won’t spoil here. And there are edge of the seat clashes between Rey and Kylo, daring rescues, the Indiana Jones-style hunt for a clue that will lead the Resistance to the Emperor’s location, and a spectacular space battle to enjoy. In fact, all the things you want from a Star Wars movie – plus a fitting and rather lovely ending to the Skywalker story that has enthralled generations and will no doubt continue to do so for many more years. Younger viewers (under age 10) may find Emperor Palpatine scary to look at, as he resembles a corpse and has white eyes. Also, his setting – a dark cavern – and the flickering lights on him may make him even more unsettling to junior viewers. As with all the Star Wars movies, there are numerous light sabre battles, times when the heroes are in danger and tense battles in space.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," So, Emperor Palpatine isnât dead. This huge bombshell is thrown out in the opening crawl of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker with all the impact of a proton torpedo missing an exhaust port. If it feels like the return of the greatest villain of the decades-long story of the Skywalker family for this ninth and putative final episode should be handled with more weight, strap in â nothing means anything here. Itâs an unspoken time after the Resistance was eviscerated at the end of Rian Johnsonâs The Last Jedi, and whatâs left of the guerrilla force is hiding out on a remote planet. Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Driver), aka Darth Incel, is sulking his way around the galaxy, while Rey (Ridley) is completing her Jedi training under General Leia Organa (the late Fisher, her performance seemingly completed from outtakes). Meanwhile, the bromance between ex-Stormtrooper Finn (Boyega) and hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Isaac) is back on after they receive a message that thereâs a spy within Renâs First Order, feeding them vital information. Apparently, Palpatine (McDiarmid, sadly sleepwalking through the part) has constructed a massive fleet of Star Destroyers (donât ask how) with his new death cult of engineers, and has offered them to Ren if he only kills Rey. Can Kylo Ren become Ben Solo again? Will Rey get over her doubts about who she is? Will everything be tied together? Ish. Even returning writer/director J.J. Abrams has admitted that heâs not good at endings, and Iâll give him that: When heâs right, heâs right. His latest shuffle through the toy box George Lucas created manages a sin previously unknown in the franchise, in that itâs utterly immemorable. Thereâs a key revelation that is so spectacularly misguided that it boggles the mind that it ever made it past the first draft. Itâs not just poorly handled (although thatâs true), but it also makes no sense and both undoes a cornerstone of Johnsonâs film and shows no understanding of Lucasâ overarching mythology that took six films to build, backward and forward. Yes, everyone knows that the Skywalker saga has narrative gaps and leaps, but Lucas et al. always gave the viewers a launch pad, or at least little hints of clues, that allowed them to speculate without getting dragged into minutiae. Abrams â and I do not say this lightly â fundamentally does not seem to understand how storytelling works. Moreover, the first hour is startlingly artlessly constructed. Nothing has any meaning, as the heroes go on a hunt for a literal plot device, a McGuffin with a McGuffin hidden within it that will unlock another McGuffin, which is then blocked by another plot device so arbitrary that it feels purely like a setup for a gag at the expense of a beloved character. Even the Force itself is reduced from metaphysical unifier to a grab bag of superpowers. Abrams does everything that the earlier films did â right or wrong, whatever your opinion â and rehashes them in worse shape. Think âJedi Rocksâ sucks? Wait for Burning Man in space. Would that matter in any other franchise? Probably not. After all, if this was The Fast and the Furious, Ben Solo would have turned back to a good guy somewhere around act two of The Force Awakens, and the whole mass murder thing would never be mentioned again. Instead, Abrams seemingly never grasps how to anchor the shifting inner lives of Rey and Kylo, while just leaving Finn, Chewie, and Dameron to fill time and crack jokes. Itâs all about the next cool shot, the next fan-service moment, the next opportunity to crowbar in a recognizable face or add a handful of new characters weâve never seen before â often at the expense of more established characters. Take the new, adorable, and merchandisable droid D-0: He adds nothing to the story, and simultaneously Abrams manages to completely forget about R2-D2, a feat thatâs borderline miraculous. The script never knows whether it wants to be reverential or referential, and ends up being a hodgepodge of cameos and flashbacks. Hanging threads from the first two films in this trilogy are either gallingly cut (Rose, played by Tran, is now a background character) or restored to no end. So, yes, if you wanted more of the Knights of Ren, yes, theyâre back, but be careful what you wish for. For anyone crying out for an onscreen appearance by a hydra-skimmer from Doomworld, the third arc of the original Star Wars comic from 1978, Abrams has your back. If you want a movie to care about, tough. Abrams seems to believe that the audience will forgive every shortcut because theyâre Star Wars fans. But much as he left traditional Star Trek fans livid with his ham-handed revisionism on that hard reboot, here heâs even more likely to raise the ire of people who have bled these stories for decades. Sigh. Well, at least he put the proper round antenna back on the Falcon.

"Dec 19, 2019"," More than 40 years in the making, the “Star Wars” trilogy of trilogies finds its way to the end – kind of. Not that we (those who saw the original “Star Wars” in theaters in the days before Fandango or the Internet) ever thought it would really be made into the extended triple trilogy envisioned by George Lucas. But with Disney managing the final three of “The Force Awakens” (2015), “The Last Jedi” (2017) and now “The Rise of Skywalker,” there’s been a revival of excitement that went missing when the inert, Lucas-helmed prequel series of the late ’90s and early 2000s neutered the frenetic fandom of the original “Star Wars” (1977) and the enterprise’s crowning jewel, “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980). Just because you build it doesn’t mean you own it. That’s something Lucas learned in 1980, when he turned “Empire” over to Irvin Kershner and then returned to make the less-than-satisfying “Return of the Jedi” (1983). J. J. Abrams, who so brilliantly rebooted the “Star Trek” franchise and gave great lift to the “Star Wars” sequel trilogy with “The Force Awakens,” gets Lucas-ed himself with this latest chapter, which tries to do too much in the name of nostalgia. “Rise of Skywalker” feels more like a Disney theme park experience than an organic narrative. Everything but Yoda and the kitchen sink (and blessedly no Jar Jar Binks, perhaps the most obnoxious incarnation ever to grace the screen) are in it. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess/General Leia (Carrie Fisher, eerily from beyond), Luke (Mark Hamill), the remains of the old Death Star, Ewoks and even Billy Dee Williams show up. The latter, with his smooth, amiable grin, almost saves this hyperdrive-driven mashup by himself. Of course, the pivotal triad of Jedi-in-the-making Rey (Daisy Ridley), stormtrooper-gone-good Finn (John Boyega) and rebel ace Poe (Oscar Isaac) are the focus, but none of the three – all fine actors – are Billy Dee Williams. What’s to know? Well, there’s a lot about bloodlines. We all know Darth Vader’s protege, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) was formerly known as Ben Solo, but who made Rey? All that’s gets answered, but first Finn, Poe and Rey must take out a massive fleet of imperial starship cruisers, each equipped with planet-killing cannons, and Kylo is hot on their heels due to a pact he has made with the Dark Sith Lord because (somebody cue up the Tears for Fears) everybody wants to rule the world – well, galaxy. Yes the tired trope of the battle between good and evil and pull of the Dark Side (they live in shitty, light-starved dungeons, so I don’t get the appeal) gets bandied about as sleek spaceships zip through narrow confines and lightsabers buzz. There are some really neat action sequences (Rey taking out a cruiser with a lightsaber tops them all), but most feel overstaged or worse, video-game lackadaisical. And that’s the problem with “Rise of Skywalker”: There’s never any real peril or character development. As much as I tip my hat to Abrams for getting the whole shebang back on track, Rian Johnson helmed “The Last Jedi” with greater breadth and depth and might have been the better choice here. As is, “Rise of Skywalker” feels like an intergalactic chess game that we know the outcome of, but don’t particularly care about. Fortunately there are the droids – and though BB-8 and R2 are cute, they don’t endear so much here. The real fun is the dicey reboot of C-3PO (the droid played by Anthony Daniels through all nine chapters) and the human-shy (from abuse) duck-like droid that says “No thank you” a lot. And, yes, it’s a win to see Chewbacca re-team with Willams’ Lando Calrissian, as well as Keri Russel as a former spice bootlegger who ran with Poe, wearing sleek garb that’s something of an unholy cross between Ant-Man and the Wasp’s superhero costumes (since Disney now also owns the Marvel Universe, it probably required only an internal memo to filch the design). For the record, this guy who saw the 1977 “Star Wars” in a second-run theater (Newtown, Connecticut’s Edmund Town Hall Theatre) refuses to refer to it as “A New Hope,” as it’s been revised and retconned with all the Episode III, IX, V, etc., tags. If you need a table of contents and a rebranding to make it all make sense, where’s the fun? As is, IX doesn’t feel like a closing chapter. There’s closure and revelation, but there are also seams enough for another 40 years. Tom Meek is a writer living in Cambridge.

FILM REVIEW – STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. With Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Ian McDiarmid, Oscar Isaac, Billy Dee Williams. Written by Chris Terrio & J.J. Abrams. Directed by J.J. Abrams. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action. 141 minutes. The release of the original “Star Wars” in May 1977 was a game-changer for moviegoers and for Hollywood. The release of STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, the final chapter of the nine-film “Skywalker Saga” entertains and will satisfy many fans, but will not linger in the memory. After the climax of Marvel’s “Avengers: Endgame,” the stakes here seem a bit of a letdown. It’s unlikely that this is what was intended when George Lucas launched the enterprise more than 42 years ago. During the opening crawl, we’re told that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) appears to be alive and is pulling the strings to crush the rebel Resistance. General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher in repurposed outtakes from the two previous films) has been training Rey (Daisy Ridley), who is soon out on a crucial mission with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) along with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). It’s a bit of a shaggy dog story as they move from planet to planet, with only two plot points that matter. First, Rey has to confront and resolve the psychic bond she has with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who is in charge of the First Order, the successor to Darth Vader and the evil Empire in the earlier films. It takes up a lot of the film’s running time and makes little sense, even in terms of the fantasy world of the series. Second, we have to get to the final end of the war that has driven the series featuring both an epic space battle and a showdown with Palpatine. None of the newer cast members have the panache of Fisher, Mark Hamill, or Harrison Ford from the original Trilogy, although Billy Dee Williams – reprising his role as Lando Calrissian from “The Empire Strikes Back” (1980) – gives it a go. Ridley and Driver get to pout and brood and strike poses, but never fully engage us. A number of veterans of the series make appearances on screen or, in one scene, on the soundtrack. However, it is the use of Carrie Fisher here that proves to be a major flaw. Leia is a key figure in the series and Fisher was, arguably, irreplaceable, but the use of archival footage, CGI, and body doubles is awkward and obvious. In scenes where Leia is supposed to be speaking with other characters, we are reminded of her absence more than her presence. Daniel M.

"Dec 19, 2019"," The long, strange outer space trip has finally come to a close. After 40-plus years and eight (primary) films worth of sci-fi action, adventure and increasingly contested drama, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” has arrived to bring the core “Star Wars” saga in for a landing. For the most part, it’s all the excitement and spectacle you’d hope for, but like Kylo Ren’s reconstituted Darth Vader helmet, there are a few obvious cracks. When we last left our heroes, 2017’s polarizing “The Last Jedi” left Jedi Knight prodigy Rey (Daisy Ridley) and erstwhile rebel leader General Leia (Carrie Fisher) at the head of a stripped-down band of resistance fighters, trying to keep up the fight against Leia’s estranged son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and the fascist First Order bad guys, aka Galactic Empire 2.0. Things were looking bleak, and as “Rise of Skywalker” opens, not much has changed. Rey is continuing her Jedi training while fellow Resistance fighters Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) help General Leia to rebuild the cause. But across the galaxy, trouble is brewing. Kylo Ren has followed a mysterious transmission to a hidden world of Sith Lords (the yang to the Jedi yin) and made a terrifying discovery that won’t be a surprise to anyone who has been watching the film’s trailers: Emperor Palpatine (an always-brilliant Ian McDiarmid), long thought dead, has somehow been running the whole Sith show all along. There’s more. Palpatine has constructed a new and improved fleet of warships, poised to retake the galaxy as the rebranded Final Order, and he wants Kylo Ren to succeed him as the new Emperor … once he kills Rey and vanquishes the Jedi once and for all. With a little sleuthing, Rey and Co. get wind of the new plan and set out to locate the hidden Sith planet and take the fight to the bad guys directly. But along the way, they’ll need the help of some new and old friends and, ultimately, Rey is going to have to face the temptation to turn to the Dark Side of the Force. What follows is packed with enough “Star War” staples — mind-blowing visual effects, exotic set pieces and high-octane action sequences built around layers of character drama — to keep hard-core and casual fans happy. It doesn’t quite have the “money moments” of “Last Jedi” — think of the Rey-Ren team-up vs. the red guards, or the “Holdo Maneuver” jump to light speed through a Star Destroyer — but there are enough twists and surprises and payoffs to make “Rise of Skywalker” a worthy finale for the new trilogy, and the film is a thoughtful send-off to Fisher, who died in 2016. As a finale to the whole saga, though, you have to be a little more critical, and that’s when the behind-the-scenes drama starts to seep through. For “Rise of Skywalker,” “The Force Awakens” director J.J. Abrams returns to the helm, and it feels like a lot of the film is an attempt to appease the complaints vocal fans made about Rian Johnson’s “Last Jedi.” There’s also a bit too much fan service (I’ll withhold specific examples for spoiler’s sake), and the last half of the film is pretty predictable. Overall, the Disney-era trilogy did a lot of things right, perhaps in no more important way than by restoring the feel of George Lucas’ original trilogy. Like “Force Awakens” and “Last Jedi,” “Rise of Skywalker” captures a sense of gritty outer space fantasy and fun that the plastic prequel films from the early 2000s could never achieve. But in the same way “Force Awakens” was really a soft reboot of 1977’s “A New Hope,” key elements of “Rise of Skywalker” ultimately feel like a mirror of 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” and the final trilogy feels a little too dependent where it could have stood on its own. Writing as a lifelong “Star Wars” fan, for most audiences, the cracks won’t be a problem; “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is a lot of fun, a genuine achievement and a great way to spend a couple of hours at the theater. There’s certainly nothing wrong with a kick of nostalgia from time to time, and it’s always nice to take a trip to a galaxy far, far away. But once the stardust settles, we’ll probably still admit that the original trilogy is just never going to be matched. Rating explained: “The Rise of Skywalker” is rated PG-13 for considerable sci-fi action violence and some frightening imagery that could be too intense for younger “Star Wars” fans.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","It's a rushed film that force throws everything at the screen, resulting in a lackluster ending that goes out with a whimper instead of a bang.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2019"," The worst-kept secret is out! Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is back, and he’s making ultimatums to all rebel (sorry, “resistance”) scum: surrender unconditionally or die screaming. General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) orders her top-billed list of single-syllable heroes to save the galaxy before the clock runs out: Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey (Daisy Ridley); Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) has “other things to do” in the script off-camera. Meanwhile, Darth Tantrum aka Kylo Ren aka Ben Solo (Adam Driver) is commanded to destroy Rey once and for all, but when has Ben ever done as he’s told? Plus General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) is off doing… well, Hux things. You know what you signed up for. Lightsaber duels, starfighter dogfights, dark side vs. light side, and all things destiny and inevitable. At least Syfy’s reboot of “Battlestar Galactica” got this right: “this has all happened before, and it will all happen again,” so pretending this is less about money than art is a given — cha-ching. While few would dispute that director J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens cribbed the best parts of the original Star Wars and re-packaged it for new audiences, director Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi dared to pull the curtain back on greater themes and story arcs that polarized the rebel fan base. As J.J. takes the reins again for the supposed end of the Skywalker saga and capping nine films over 42 years, can audiences really expect to get everything they wanted, or is this another Superman Returns in the making?

It’s as good as one might hope… but also as bad. Desperate to immediately “do something,” the first hour is a jumble of run-jump-info-dumps before taking a minute for someone to explain the final quests and who’s doing what where and with/to whom. It’s big, it’s epic, and it really doesn’t make sense from anything resembling science, but it does establish the rules we’re going to end big on… and then it does. Appropriately giving Carrie Fisher top billing, the big Skywalker finale isn’t the best film of the series but does manage closure of every current character arc, topping it off with a perfect coda before the credits. First, the bad. Apparently, heroes can get anywhere in the galaxy in under an hour, which is necessary considering they have less than a day to save the day (not even kidding). We never hear any “broadcast,” which would have made for a chilling teaser trailer instead of just Palpatine’s laugh and a media confirmation that it was McDiarmid. The decision to push Kelly Tran’s Rose into the background while forcing Keri Russell’s new character Zorii Bliss upon fans is a borderline criminal offense that feels obvious. J.J. Abrams seems to be of the mind that, if a set piece, setting, or plot point makes no sense, make it as big and spectacular as possible and maybe no one will point out how ridiculous it is… just as long as it looks cool. Heck, The Fast and the Furious franchise has gotten away with that forever. Now the good. This is the best Daisy Ridley performance of Rey since she first appeared, with both she and Adam Driver willing their characters into more than just a description on a page… and yes, they manage to find a sensible (read: acceptable) way to resolve “Reylo” without rewarding Darth Tantrum for a decade of wholesale slaughter. While the reasons behind all the craziness are highly questionable, when did Star Wars EVER champion science over fiction? When the good guys win, they win big, and even the most jaded fans can find solace in the finality of the main arc once and for all. Are you listening, Disney? Let it go. “The Mandalorian” on Disney Plus is proof that the right idea can be done well using the same setting. Truth be told, Rogue One is probably the best Star Wars story to date, and arguably the best of all the films — yes, including The Empire Strikes Back. If nothing else, we’ve finally put the Skywalker saga into the ground so Disney can at last move onto all-new cinematic stories to be told. Is it too early to start campaigning for a Star Wars What-If: The Reign of Darth Rey?",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," When Star
Wars debuted in 1977, it was an immediate revolution of cinema and
culture. Audiences voted with their wallets: This is how we want our stories
delivered, and these are the stories we desire. Four decades later, Star
Wars is less a cinematic revolution and more a cultural one. 2015’s The
Force Awakens kicked off a string of franchise remakes starring
female leads, while the visage of Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) became the
honorary icon of the Resistance following the election of Donald Trump in 2016.
2017’s The Last Jedi leaned into the multi-threaded
beast whole hog to both delight and chagrin. Out came the Star
Wars fanboys, so upset they were, they called for Disney to start
again and refashion their beloved modern-day King Arthur tale in their image. Audiences wanted the
movies to look back on past glories fondly; audiences wanted the movies to move
the cultural conversation forward. They wanted nostalgia; they wanted progress.
The center could not hold. There once was a time when Star
Wars could unite that which politics divided. That time has passed. Like previous
installments, Episode Nine begins in media
res: Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) searching the galaxy for puppet master
supreme, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Ren finds him, infirmed and frail
but seemingly incapable of dying. Palpatine has amassed a fortune of followers,
and, with his last gasp, is ready to crush the rebellion once and for all. It’s
his Final Solution — pardon — Final Order. Who stands in the path
of this powerful despot? The last Jedi: Rey (Daisy Ridley), clothed in the same
egg-shell-colored cloth Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) sported all those years
ago. It’s worth noting Rey’s costume design: Functional and comfortable. When
she stands next to Ren — stylish black cape, padded black sweater, black helmet
with red veins running all around — it looks obvious who would win in a fight.
He has the theatrics, but she has the range. Costume design,
metaphors of fascism, the iconic hum of lightsabers and the screech of
spaceships — they all work beautifully. What doesn’t work: The curtain call of
characters trotted out in the name of fan service, the constant threat of
sacrifice where there is none, and a story crafted by four writers who lean so
heavily on old tropes and familiar faces that they fail to create their own
sense of wonder. Visually, Skywalker
is awash in special effects, dramatic close-ups and smash cuts. It’s like
watching a runner trip mid-stride: Keep moving forward, no matter how clumsy it
looks, or fall flat on your face. Rise
of Skywalker doesn’t fall flat on its face (for a movie
two-and-a-half hours long, it’s pretty engaging). But temporary engagement does
not a movie make — or a franchise. Somewhere along the line, the thread was
lost. Try as they might, it doesn’t feel like hope, and it doesn’t feel like
rebellion. It feels like another asset in a multi-national corporation’s
portfolio. It feels like commerce. That’s entertainment? Due to severe weather this past week, Boulder Weekly is currently experiencing phone outages.

"Dec 19, 2019"," So the ninth and last (we think) movie in the Star Wars saga arrives, and there’s only one thing on our minds. When will Darth Vader’s disturbing grandson, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and Rey (Daisy Ridley) do something about their outrageously obvious telepathic sexual tension and just get a room already? When will they do something about the symbolism of these lightsaber duels of theirs, secure a furtive daytime booking at some intergalactic Premier Inn and give us the most rock’n’roll sex scene – come to think of it, the only sex scene – in Star Wars history? Surely the suits at Disney would be OK with it? Well, oddly, the symbolism of Romeo and Juliet (as well as Dunkirk) might just occur to you in the course of this crazily but very entertainingly grandiloquent adventure. Now, The Rise of Skywalker has been rather coolly received in some quarters, and I certainly think it isn’t quite as strong as The Last Jedi, around which critical consensus has gathered. (In this trilogy of trilogies, incidentally, it is the second film in each trio – The Empire Strikes Back, Attack of the Clones and The Last Jedi – that has been the strongest episode, though Clones did not have much competition.) There is, I admit, some excessive MacGuffinism (the use of arbitrary objects to drive the story), especially when everyone conceives a great desire to get hold of a supernaturally potent glass tetrahedron, which is then smashed before someone miraculously comes across another mystically significant glass tetrahedron, murmuring: “Oh, there were two!” Which brings us to the second flaw in episode nine: a habit of nullifying jeopardy by perpetually bringing dead people or things back to life. People are forever dying and then returning to the screen, either as poignant memories, or quasi-ghosts, or horribly unnatural resurrections. Partly, I think this is an over-writing flaw, with director JJ Abrams (having taken over from Colin Trevorrow over “creative differences”) working with co-writer Chris Terrio and perhaps over-zealously trying to correct what fans saw as the fault with The Last Jedi and to cover as much ground and as many alternative realities as possible, in the service of a resounding finality. In fact, the ending is no cop-out. There is real sacrifice. And, to some degree, the dying-not-dying motif was forced on Abrams and Terrio by the fact that Carrie Fisher, who plays General Leia Organa died after the last film, and her marginal presence here has been fabricated with a piece of unused footage in which Fisher is making general-purpose observations that have been ingeniously sewn into dialogue scenes. The situation now is that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned, after we all thought we’d heard the last of him. He has been resurrected in an almost satanic procedure as the artificially galvanised undead Sith lord, wired up to some source of daemonic Sith energy. From here, Palpatine plans to embark on a new insurgency of evil from the First Order, in which General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E Grant) will be complicit and which involves the agonised, almost tragic figure of Kylo Ren, the Order’s leader. And Driver’s performance is genuinely excellent – he brings an absolute commitment to the role, distinguishing it from the tongue-in-cheek black comedy of Gleeson, and, however absurd it sounds, there is subtlety and even delicacy in his vocal range. What this means is a gallant fightback from the Resistance and the old gang springing into action: Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). There is great chemistry and ésprit de corps between them all as they helter-skelter anarchically and almost plotlessly from exotic planet location to exotic planet location, going into full Indiana Jones mode as they barrel about – incidentally discovering, to their enormous chagrin, that stormtroopers can fly these days. Of course, just as with The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens, very familiar tropes and plotlines are being revived, and maybe the distinctive theme of this trilogy is this fan-fiction-style tribute to the first films. But, however preposterous, The Rise of Skywalker is socked over with such energy, such euphoric certainty. And it’s such fun: full of the rackety exuberance of the now forgotten Saturday morning movie serials that were an influence on George Lucas. Comedy was, incidentally, the keynote of Ron Howard’s excellent and very underrated non-Skywalker-saga Solo: A Star Wars Story. It’s right now for the saga to end, or at any rate to lie fallow, and to leave us with such an exhilarating flourish.  This article was amended on 20 December 2019 because while Solo: A Star Wars Story does not form part of the Skywalker series, an earlier version was wrong to refer to the film as non-canonical.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker director J.J. Abrams impresses me with his ability to direct a story that is told in a clear, engaging, and tight manner. There are side quests that certainly could have been cut, shortened, or altered to take up less running time. However, the overarching story is interestingly epic and gives each pivotal character a fantastic arc. A year after the events of The Last Jedi, darkness continues to push Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to rid the Jedi. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and the rest of the Resistance, led by General Leia (Carrie Fisher), must face off against the forces of evil in order to save those whom they love. The film starts off intriguingly, wasting no time establishing character goals and motivations. From the first twenty minutes, I was highly invested in seeing what would happen to all of the characters and felt some real suspense, wondering how it would all conclude. The Rise of Skywalker is a film that is communicated in such a clear manner that someone who has generally kept up with the narrative can follow along and not be bogged down by convoluted Star Wars jargon. The plot is simple, effective, and the pacing is more upbeat than some of the other films (although some fluff is still present in this 2 hour and 22 minute film). The cinematography, visual effects, and score all come together to create several beautiful vibrant eye-catching sequences that are action-packed, often epic, and even sometimes emotional. Specifically, the action scenes in The Rise of Skywalker are shot and edited extremely well; from spaceship and lightsaber battles, scenes are full of high-saturated colors and are impressive. Some action sequences run too long but that is coming from someone who is not the biggest lover of elongated action scenes. While the setup and conclusion are executed in a gripping way, there are some side quests that easily could have been cut or altered to save time and get to the point even faster. For example, our protagonists find a dagger that has an important message on it written in an unrecognizable “sith language”. Unfortunately, C3P0 is forbidden to translate it. This is an interesting situation; our droid friend has information helpful to his allies but due to the way he is programmed, he can’t fork up the translation. I wouldn’t have minded if a few minutes were spent on persuading him to translate it or the heroes themselves reprogramming C3P0. Instead, we get a fair share of time spent on our heroes having to go to a new location to find someone who can assist with the conundrum and by the end of the film, these scenes do not feel so important. While this is my “biggest” complaint with The Rise of Skywalker, it is ultimately very minute, as there is a lot to love and digest. The finale is epic. Everything I said of the action scenes applies to the finale; but not only are these scenes beautiful– they are poignantly unique. From strobe lighting, to the way lightsabers are used, and the way all of the special effects and sounds (and lack of) are implemented, I was in awe of how all of these elements were stitched together to finish off the climactic arc in the film. The amount of footage that Disney had of Carrie Fisher was spectacular and worked tremendously well. The manner in which Abrams and the writing team utilized her character was satisfying, fitting, and touching. Themes related to confronting fear, accepting who you are, who you are not, forgiveness, and ones’ destiny are all themes explored in The Rise of Skywalker. I will not spoil any of the plot in order to explain how the themes are prevalent but I found the themes to positive ones that were implemented seamlessly. Overall, Episode IX may be my favorite film in the franchise due to the way it spectacularly grows its already-developed characters, delivers on epic action, and concludes a saga that has spanned decades.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," A long time ago on a distant planet, a little girl cries out for her parents as they leave her behind. Where are they going? Why are they leaving her? How will she survive? Now, in the present, there is something that Rey’s adoptive family are not telling her, and she cannot find peace. Worlds burn around her as the galaxy descends into the dark reign of the First Order’s chaos. The Sith conspire to destroy everything. The dead speak. All the characters you have ever loved prepare to fight to the death against the Dark Side. But in spite of all the horror, this is Star Wars. And there is hope, always hope, and the power of the mysterious Force. The final film in the nine-part saga is an energetic caper that ties together loose ends with the dexterity of the Millennium Falcon weaving through an asteroid field. It sees villainous Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) find an old Sith map to an unchartered planet (Exogol) that holds the key to the evil First Order’s domination over the galaxy. Realising his discovery of a dark and terrifying secret, the Resistance – led by Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley), plus Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and a host of recurring characters – race to stop him from establishing a new era of Imperial rule. Returning as director, J.J. Abrams introduces an array of new planets, ships and characters that jostle for attention alongside old haunts and ghostly objects from the saga’s past in this warm and enjoyable if flawed film. From Fifth Element-style runes to sacred Jedi texts, there are enough artefacts here to fill an archive. The Rise of Skywalker is a film that makes its history tangible, and in touching and being touched, it asks that you hold on in material ways to the world and the people around you. Of course, many historic figures make meaningful returns to the screen, too, including Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and the masterful Leia (Carrie Fisher), who appears thanks to footage shot for the earlier sequel movies. For among the younger Resistance fighters, youthful imposter syndrome abounds: do they really have what it takes to honour their forebears and save the day? It’s up to the film’s elders to elevate their younger counterparts. Sometimes this means the older characters must give up their memories; sometimes the young are forced to remember. If the past must die – as Kylo asserted in The Last Jedi – then you have to reconcile yourself to your role in history, to your place in all this. Places and planets in the movie lack the iconic majesty of earlier films, with Exogol the most memorable new addition with its Revenge of the Sith-style scorched earth. In fact, there are so many new locations and characters in the film that it leaves you a little breathless, with outlaw Zorrie Bliss (Keri Russell) and First Order-survivor Jannah (Naomi Ackie) underserved by their rapid introductions and minimal screen time. Like the Millennium Falcon repeatedly jumping through hyperspace, the effect is overwhelming. Yet the rapid editing does work when juxtaposed with extreme close ups of characters and objects that create more contemplative moments of stillness. The cinematography is in the same monstrous vein as The Empire Strikes Back: all canted frames, oblique imagery and extreme high angles peering down over the perilous wrecks of the past. And both the score and sound design – which shifts from dialogue-free sequences to unnerving crackles and shrieks – are quite extraordinary. In terms of representation, the film’s female characters are poorly used. With a range of women on screen, Abrams wastes enormous potential for female friendships among familiar faces Maz (Lupita Nyong’o) and Connix (Billie Lourd) in empty gestures toward inclusivity. The sidelining of Resistance fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), one of the stars of The Last Jedi, is even more troubling. That said, there are some much-needed moments of community for the black characters, and although Finn’s sensitivity deserves greater reward, his point of view is privileged throughout. His is the beating heart of this wild and joyous film, which – finally! – gives viewers the moment of queer representation that so many of us have been looking for. Thus, The Rise of Skywalker pays dividends in fan service, and it pushes every nostalgic button on its dashboard. It’s very funny, and by twists and turns incredibly sad, too, with surprises so big that Han Solo’s ego looks small by comparison. As for Rey and Kylo’s fates – she contains multitudes, and he contains more than he ever knew. In the end, it’s a film about coming together and demonstrating kindness, about standing in solidarity and making ethical choices. In our own dark times, it reminds us of the power of hope.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","  Curiously, threads that were left hanging at the end of the last film continue dangling without being addressed here, and as a result, Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose - easily one of the best things in The Last Jedi - is frustratingly sidelined. Meanwhile, the (re)appearance of Palpatine feels off against the overall pacing of the new trilogy, as though the franchise suddenly realised that the death of Snoke left a giant baddie-shaped hole that had to be quickly plugged in order to reach a high-stakes climax. Surely it would have been better to sow seeds for this earlier, and the fact that this didn’t happen just points to a lack of planning and foresight from Disney. Still, this is all part of the fun, right? Pointing at flaws, arguing over off-screen details, suggesting how things should have been rewritten... this is what it really means to watch a Star Wars film, isn’t it? These are the REAL hallmarks of the franchise. Maybe Rian Johnson had it right all along?   Additional observations - There is a moment that happens early on between Finn and Rey that results in an unanswered question. There's even a couple of callbacks to it later on. But then... never again, and we never actually get a resolution to it. It's like it got removed in the last draft of the script and everyone forgot about it.- There's one great moment of justice for Chewie that got one of the biggest cheers of the film, and it's such a small, token scene. PEOPLE REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS SHIT.- There's something really thrilling about seeing Rey as a full powered, fully-fledged Jedi. She is awesome. That is all.- All the Carrie Fisher scenes are handled really well considering they're mostly pulled together from unused footage of the previous films. If you didn't know that was the case, you wouldn't even notice the compromises and technical wizardry that must have occurred to make it all work.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," There will never be anything quite like Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker, or at the very least, there will never be anything quite like it’s build-up. Upon seeing the first official trailer I was stunned by the finality, I felt like a journey which spanned my entire life and beyond was indeed coming to an end and no matter what it was happening in this film.  I was endeared to it ever since, continuously excited from the day I saw the trailer all the way up to when I sat down to watch. The dramatic nostalgia-filled months before had me almost certain that no matter what I saw, I would at least like it, and now, finally, I can share my thoughts.  The Rise of Skywalker joins us once again with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and her crew of resistance friends. But with Supreme leader Snoke cut in half towards the end of the last film a new chief bad guy is required, so we welcome once again, the man who is technically the only Star Wars villain now, Emperor Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Deranged and damaged from his famous fall he now spreads across the galaxy a message of vengeance, something that captures the ears of the only two people capable of stopping him, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey herself.  Tied together by an unknown bond, the two begin hunting Palpatine playing cat and mouse across the stars with each other along the way. All the while the resistance, led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) sits on its last legs championing only Rey as their final hope.  I want to begin with saying that my labelling the experience an “utter mess” doesn’t even mean I hate the film. When The Rise of Skywalker gets things right it’s awe-inspiring and powerful just like the best of the franchise. However, when it gets things wrong, which is more often than not, it becomes a confusing, unnecessary, fan service filled, hoax of a film, formed solely in the dysfunctional Disney system that hampered its production.  The decision to change director’s mid trilogy only to change back is maligned by many, and rightly so, you can’t expect two different directors to have the same artistic vision for something so massive. J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson are terrific filmmakers but asking them to see the Galaxy Far Far Away in one identical way is impossible.  Still, it would seem their ability to work together is non-existent as there can only be one major take away from watching Episode IX. Once it’s finished, almost nothing about The Last Jedi matters, and to watch the trilogy and comprehend it, one would only really need to watch The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker, with The Last Jedi being demoted to that of a tie in film.  This frustrating realisation comes upon noticing the three very distinctly different films that exist within Episode IX. The first is a film designed to ensure everything built up as significant in Episode VIII is affirmed as unimportant for this film, with some examples of this being heinously blatant. The second film in this trilogy unto itself is that of what Abrams replaces TLJ with, the travelling, the object hunting, the tiny pieces of mid-movie character development, a lot of which feels unnecessary, as if only dreamt up to keep certain characters busy.  The final film is everything that feels final about The Rise of Skywalker, this is by far the best movie of the three, and the other two films almost totally destroy it. And what is the bane of each part? Fanservice. Don’t get me wrong, I’ll bite to fanservice and enjoy it just as much as anyone, but when done so poorly, and so obviously simply because it could be done, what is there to love? So many reveals and moments in The Rise of Skywalker feel as if J.J. himself is appearing on screen and winking at the audience, it’s tacky and uninventive. In attempting to fit an entire trilogies worth of narrative into one film, Abrams only managed to make a something unrecognisable when compared to much of the other 8 instalments. He runs almost the entire first half of this entry at a blistering pace, which is his simplistic answer to TLJ leaving almost no overarching structure to work with, and when watching it’s almost impossible not to scrutinize.  The sensory overload that is the first half of The Rise of Skywalker is purely a sequence of very convenient plot points designed not to get us from point A to point B but to get us from point A to point Z. So much happens I could hardly keep track of what was important, which upon reinspection wasn’t that much. Indeed, once the film is done apologising for TLJ, the narrative begins to waste time until its able to start wrapping things up. Finally, here’s where the good begins. Rey and Kylo are everything great about this film. The chemistry between them remains as unique as ever and just as intense as Johnson developed it. Their relationship and connection are the only clear-cut things that matter about TLJ, and I’m very thankful for that. Watching them battle has never been better than in this film, and the hallmark scene of them combating one another is a wonderfully choreographed visual spectacle.  The trilogy is about these two characters, and the rest merely happen to be there, and that’s fine. I only wish they had committed to doing this from the beginning rather than it just turning out this way. Regardless Episode IX is their show, and when they are allowed to be the centre of attention, they shine far brighter than anyone else (except maybe the needlessly bright lightning strikes peppered throughout).  In looking to atone for the supposed “Sins” of Episode VIII The Rise of Skywalker has only managed to forget to make itself feel important, and as a result, ends the Skywalker Saga with a film of wondrous moments that becomes hollow when viewed as part of something larger.

"Dec 19, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the modern trilogy’s weakest entry. The generic conclusion suggests the senseless backlash to Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (TLJ, 2017) has urged Disney and returning director J. J. Abrams to narrow the artistic and creative paradigms of this finale. Skywalker’s rhythms preference generic action beats and its limp storyline relies too heavily on major contrivances to resolve its protagonist’s story arc. Instead of transporting his characters to fresh avenues of the galaxy, Abrams and his co-writer, Chris Terrio, take shortcuts. They lean too heavily on fan service and nostalgia to please loyalists. The result is an underwhelming remake of Return of the Jedi (1983) that also undoes the solid work of the previous films, including Abrams’ The Force Awakens (TFA, 2015). The most pressing point has been the bloodline of Rey (Daisy Ridley). The answers have been frustratingly slow because there has been no endpoint planned from the start. Instead, audiences have been teased about her parentage and relationship to the Force. In this ninth episode, she is ordered by Leia (Carrie Fisher) to complete her training. However, she is distracted by the telepathy of her nemesis, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who taunts her about joining the dark side. Once reunited with her friends, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), C3PO (Anthony Daniels), and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), the group ventures to find two objects, a mini pyramid and a dagger, which will lead them to where the First Order’s final fleet is hiding. Meanwhile, the evil Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned and demands that Kylo eliminates Rey. He promises him an army and unmatched power if he completes this task. Following the dismal prequels, Abrams’ impossible task was redefining Star Wars for Disney and without George Lucas’ input. TFA was a strong entry. It succeeded through imaginative set pieces, a tactile aesthetic design, and by teasing Rey’s heritage. Abrams’ direction suggested care for the world and its characters as much as the action. The most memorable scene was the quietest. We watched Rey live her life in the desert as a self-sufficient scavenger amidst the fading wreckage of an AT-AT Walker. It was low-key character building that strengthened our fondness and understanding of Rey’s way of life. Too much of Skywalker lingers on autopilot and lacks similar reprieve. Clunky exposition dominates the quiet scenes and the action rhythms are repetitive and uninvolving. Rey’s group lands in a location, discusses the plot, and is then ambushed by stormtroopers before escaping. The setup rarely changes. Johnson’s film was an imperfect sequel but had the nerve to be structurally daring and allowed its characters to unexpectedly stumble. The over-the-top reactions to TLJ has ensured Disney and Abrams are now tentative about upsetting obnoxious fans with changes. Their filmic style is both brisk and cautious, and too tentative to ever surprise or innovate. A major talking point of Skywalker’s story is Palpatine’s return. He received his comeuppance in Return of the Jedi after falling down a well like Timmy O’Toole in The Simpsons. His revival is unceremonious because it is contrived, badly explained, and laughably cheesy. Forty years ago, it might have been menacing watching him rub his hands together and cackling loudly in his man cave. After experiencing Donald Trump, Palpatine is corny not intimidating. His major revelation evokes feelings of disbelief because it was unearned in TFA and TLJ and is a ‘jump the shark’ moment. It does not help that his inconceivable return is also addressed with clunky dialogue at the start. ‘Palpatine is back! He’s been pulling the strings from the shadows!’ Poe explains. Johnson said that when approached for his film there was no clear trajectory. The lack of planning is apparent because Palpatine is clumsily reintroduced to rewrite Snork’s unexpected death in TLJ. The much-hyped return of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) proves to be another pointless ode to fan service. There is also a ghostly reappearance of Luke that is an unnecessary rewrite of a genuinely funny and unexpected moment in TLJ. It thumbs its nose at Johnson’s work as if gleeful about its own by-the-numbers plotting. Similarly, the last hour rehashes Return of the Jedi and various Marvel films. It is disappointing that Abrams resorts to the most overused trope in Star Wars and superhero films: a battle in the sky against a giant airship. Meanwhile, the showdown with Palpatine copies Jedi’s ending. The familiarity dilutes the tension and the likelihood of Rey choosing the dark side. A Daenerys-esque arc of descending into madness is hinted at, including a cheesy horror image in the dark, but the outcome is clear. It withdraws from how recent entries tried blurring the lines between good and evil. Skywalker’s action sequences are remote rather than truly involving. Perhaps it is the monotony of set pieces in mainstream movies, but there is never a time when the iconic Star Wars music score enriches the combat. The gears turn but there’s a lack of invention and inspiration. The same is true of Abrams’ visual spectrum, which omits memorable artistic imagery. His input involves cross-cutting rapidly between threads and establishing the next tension-free set piece. There is a festival scene where hundreds of alien creatures celebrate and a lightsaber duel on a fallen Death Star as waves crash violently. Neither scene matches the exhilaration of the casino sequence in TLJ. While supposedly concerned about its character bonds, Skywalker proves impersonal. TFA suggested its trio would be equal but the promise is diluted by making Rey the centrepiece. The creative choice typifies Disney’s preference for princesses searching for their individuality. Consequently, the only memorable performance is by Daisy Ridley. She possesses the visceral emotional charge needed to underline Rey’s internal conflict. Her dogged resistance to her past is pivotal to countering the abrupt interrogations of Kylo who tries drawing her towards darkness. His pursuit is unquestionably a metaphor for love, but after three films the series is indecisive about their bond. Its resolution is contradicted by a cornball epilogue. A similar example of attempting to please everyone involves Rey’s training. She struggles with her tasks (a rebuttal to misogynists who whined she was perfect) but later performs an incredible move where she slashes a vehicle in two and then single-handedly destroys a transport ship. Aside from Rey, Driver’s Kylo is visibly tormented but lacks the palpable danger of a classic villain. As Finn, John Boyega dutifully partakes in the action, but his arc, including connecting with Jannah (Naomi Ackie) who escaped being a stormtrooper, is superficial. Ackie’s character is introduced too late to resonate. Similarly, something important Finn wants to tell Rey is also carelessly discarded before the end. Poor Kelly Marie Tran, who played Rose in TLJ and endured terrible cyber-bullying, is sidelined until the climax. Meanwhile, Poe’s arc involves a terribly cliché encounter with a masked woman from his past named Zorii (Keri Russell). She hates him, but would you know it, she might help during a crucial moment. It is a disappointing end to a funny and energetic character. Too many scenes in Skywalker pull their punches with these players. An iconic figure is ‘killed’ but revived a scene later. This happens twice and is a cheap tactic that proves that fan loyalty comes at the cost of dramatic possibilities. Once again, Star Wars is a victim of its own success. What was once vivid and imaginative is now an overprotected commodity, less interested in exploring new ideas than serving focus groups and angry fans. Skywalker epitomises this decline into decadence. It is slickly assembled by a committee to ensure that it recreates little more than Lucas’ greatest hits. Those hoping for surprises, meaningful story arcs, engaging set pieces, and characters worth a damn, should shrug it off. The franchise that reimagined cinema and earned a second life is spinning its wheels in the coarse sand again.

"Dec 19, 2019"," That rock in the pit of your stomach that’s keeping you from being excited for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is totally warranted. The backlash Star Wars: The Last Jedi received resulted in Disney walking on eggshells for the final installment of this new trilogy. What we receive is a film that is too safe for its own good. It’s formulaic, it’s boring, and its co-writer and director J. J. Abrams ignores nearly everything established in The Last Jedi for a conclusion that is so cautious that it fails to leave any sort of lasting impression. For the end of the Skywalker saga, Abrams has taken nearly everything from Return of the Jedi besides Ewoks and has utilized it as this one-way path with no detours and no chance of deviation. As someone who sees a ton of movies every year, seeing change in cinema and films that stand out over mediocrity because they’re unique and different is a craving that is rarely satisfied. Regardless of what you think of The Last Jedi and The Mandolorian, at least they’re offering us stories in the Star Wars universe that aren’t just frozen carbonite copies of the original Star Wars trilogy. The general consensus of the movie going public and the majority of Star Wars fans is that The Last Jedi is trash that shouldn’t exist. The Rise of Skywalker materialized because of the fan’s reactions to The Last Jedi; this is the film you should congratulate yourself for if you hated The Last Jedi; if you fall into that category, then congratulations and hopefully you enjoy it. But for everyone else this Disney Star Wars trilogy has rolled over and died without so much of a whimper. The visuals and action sequences of the film are extraordinary. The film opens with a Kylo Ren sequence set in slow-motion as he slaughters a ton of alien innocents while receiving a certain artifact essential to the new storyline in this film. This is followed up by Poe’s lightspeed skipping sequence in the Millenium Falcon and the, “they fly now,” Stormtrooper chase. All of these sequences offer thrills, excitement, and gorgeous special effects. John Williams score is as loud, triumphant, and celebratory of a 42-year-old franchise as it’s ever been. Babu Frik is cool even with the small amount of screen time he has. He’s this miniature droidsmith with a short-lived snarkiness that rivals that of Watto and Salacious B. Crumb. C-3PO is at his most humorous and poignant this time around and Kylo Ren certainly has his moments in between the turd sandwich that is the entirety of his atrocious side story. The bad certainly outweighs the good in The Rise of Skywalker though. The similarities between this film and Return of the Jedi become too blatant to be enjoyable; the teasing of the most powerful character joining the dark side, Rey’s training, Poe and Rey arguing like Han and Leia, Palpatine’s involvement, a fateful final war looming over everyone’s heads, and Kylo Ren feeling like the millennial version of Darth Vader. The homage is so apparent that it begins to feel lazy. It’s as if Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic learned nothing from attempting to recreate younger versions of Princess Leia and Grand Moff Tarkin in Rogue One. Carrie Fisher’s resurrection through unused footage from The Last Jedi and/or The Force Awakens is awful to look at. It comes off as clunky, fake, and obviously computer generated or at least computer tampered with. Completely moving on from the Leia character seems like it would have been the better option, especially when you consider the direction they go with Leia in The Rise of Skywalker. It seems like they milked something that should have been disposed of solely because this last film was supposed to be centered around Leia before Fisher’s unexpected death. The Knights of Ren are completely useless. Need some lackeys to walk in slow motion, stand around wearing black, or keep totally still in the desert while the camera revolves around them? The Knights of Ren have got you covered. Lando really only appears when nobody expects it, as well. Most of the film has Poe, Finn, or Rey acting cryptic and vague to the other two as they venture off individually. The Rise of Skywalker attempts to unveil this planet-shattering epiphany that the characters work better together and as a family than as a solo unit, which seems like something they should have realized by the end of The Force Awakens or at least halfway through The Last Jedi. Keri Russell’s new character Zorri Bliss also falls into this category. She has connections to Poe, points a gun at people, and knows how to pilot a ship but otherwise doesn’t do much of anything besides be angry at Poe. There’s this tug of war between The Force and the dark side that is so familiar and uninteresting. The culmination of what transpires between Rey and Kylo Ren is so dull that it’s practically sickening. The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t offer any sort of surprises. You know that you’ll likely never see any of these characters again since this is the conclusion of the Skywalker saga, but there’s also nothing set up for the future of the franchise. Even when The Rise of Skywalker seems to offer something different it yanks that possibility away almost instantly only to gimp along on a more stagnant and predictable path. This trilogy seems pointless because the adventures of Rey, Finn, and Poe are too busy mimicking the original films to provide anything worthwhile of their own. They are forgettable, expendable, and unimportant in the grand scheme of things. Does anyone still care about Rey’s lineage? When who she’s related to is revealed and as you consider the very last scene of the film, The Rise of Skywalker leaves you feeling empty and lethargic over a franchise that lost its way once Disney obtained the rights to Star Wars from George Lucas. At least the prequel films feel like they’re all telling a cohesive story. Disney just threw a gargantuan pile of Jabba the Hutt fecal matter against the wall and didn’t even wait to see what stuck. They jumped to conclusions while that overindulgent excrement was still in the air and somehow made it more convoluted and worthless than it’s ever been. J. J. Abrams’ foray into two Star Wars films offer little to no originality and they are lesser films because of it. The Last Jedi is the strongest film of the new trilogy because it at least made those who watched it feel something after viewing it. If you’re going to dangle this throbbing nostalgia fetish over your fanbase with little or no identity of its own, then how can you expect to leave an impact overall? The Rise of Skywalker is fun to look at and captivates with its alluring special effects, but it is a finale that infuriates to the extent that you literally don’t care anymore. Fan favorite characters deserve better and new characters deserve development that is well thought out rather than simply reactionary. Why settle for a saturated and uneven reboot of Return of the Jedi with lame plot twists and paper thin character development?",NEGATIVE

"Dec 19, 2019"," Whatever quibbles one may have over the erratic quality and lapses in storytelling logic of the Star Wars saga it’s something of a relief that The Force is strong indeed with this final chapter of the triple trilogy. Directed again by JJ Abrams, who dutifully helmed 2015’s The Force Awakens (the first of the final trilogy), The Rise of Skywalker delivers on all fronts, combining  eye-boggling visuals with a meaty central storyline loaded with a series of resounding emotional thunder bolts. It’s quite a ride. Sporting a slightly more streamlined narrative than 2017’s superbly entertaining The Last Jedi (written and directed by Rian Johnson), the core of the story involves the concerted attempt by Supreme Leader of the First Order Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to seduce Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) to The Dark Side. Parallel to this we’ve got the desperate search by The Resistance for the new battle fleet of the evil First Order, which is cleverly hiding in a shady quadrant of the galaxy known only in legend. Each of these familiar-looking star destroyers is armed with a cannon that can crack open a planet like an over-ripe coconut, so the heroic team of Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and B-88 (the rolling droid) follow a trail of leads that involve a lot of chasing, shooting, exploding and story exposition that even the most focused of fans might have trouble following. The journey is hot-wired with a quality assortment of revelations, twists and surprises as Kylo telepathically tortures Rey, who suffers from traumatic flashbacks from the time she became an orphan. To his credit, Abrams has learnt the big lesson from 1980’s The Empire Strikes Back – still the best film of the franchise – that it’s possible with the chugging locomotive of a big bubblegum film to blow a whistle, stop everything and allow a poignant dramatic moment to sear into the minds of the audience. He pulls this off several times during the film, often deploying close-ups Sergio Leone would have been proud of. It’s quite an achievement in a film with so much going on. Visually, the film is a knockout. Given how almost every major film these days has an army of digital artists and a VFX budget in the tens of millions, it’s remarkable how this film continues the Star Wars tradition of conjuring visions that are genuinely ground-breaking. The extensive use of real world locations, for instance, enhance the photo-realism of other-worldly vehicles and spaceships as they skim, bounce and crash across the landscape. Particularly impressive is Abrams’ use of focus and shallow depth of field. In terms of sheer scale, the film’s most awesome highlight involves Rey’s visit to a gigantic technological wreck that sits in an angry ocean as massive waves break upon its creaking structure. Looking like the skeleton of a fallen Death Star it’s a strangely beautiful, Gothic sequence that hits a wow factor of 11. It’s a cliche borne of the standard-setting work by Industrial Light & Magic – the effects outfit created by Star Wars maestro George Lucas (who has had nothing to do with the franchise since selling it to Disney back in 2012) – but it remains true that so much of the digital FX work looks so real, even though we know it can’t be real. Shots of massive star destroyers showing their intricate design and detail are especially intimidating, while tiny robots beep and squeak with personality. Now, this being a Star Wars movie there are, of course, a host of glaring inconsistencies and clumsy plot holes. These have become such an intrinsic part of the Star Wars canon one wonders if they have become mandatory. For instance, it’s a pity that we have reached the end of the Star Wars trail without once, in nine films, ever encountering a stormtrooper who can shoot straight. The dolts running about here are like bowling pins on legs, falling dead with a single laser blast from our heroes. This begs the question: what good does all that shiny white armour do? Yet somewhere there is always a fatal design flaw in their planning that will allow a ragtag squadron of small rebel fighters to bring down the whole apparatus. Really, 1983’s Return of the Jedi should have been the last time we saw that cliche, yet here it is again 42 years after being introduced in the original Star Wars. It’s proved a real story-telling stain on the Star Wars legacy. It’s a basic rule: if you make things too easy for the good guys their victory over evil is sapped of any real tension. Still, the pace, dazzle and emotional gravity of Rise of Skywalker earns enough credit to make you forgive these lapses. After all, it is Christmas, a time of forgiveness. For big fans of the films there’s a large array of classic references to feast on, not the least being the use of old rebel fighters and the pedigree of Rey’s light sabres, which becomes a major, moving story point. And while there is rapid cutting and crash zooms in some of the action (though much less than in the previous two films), the cinematography by Dan Mindel (Force Awakens; Star Trek) brandishes a strong sense of composition inspired by the original trilogy. Tying off the saga with what feels like a parting gift to the audience, the film ends with a final image that should put a lump in the throat of anyone who was struck by that fleeting shot in the first Star Wars of the double sunset on Tatooine as Luke looked out at the horizon wondering what the future had in store for him. To appropriate and paraphrase an old showbiz saying, Cats is the kind of modern movie musical that will have you humming the visual effects as you leave the cinema. Based on the mega-hit Andrew Lloyd-Webber musical that began life in the early 1980s, director Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech; Les Miserables) presides over a cast costumed as felines who dance and sing and leap through oversized sets depicting the gutters, back alleys and cozy homes of nighttime London. The decor and detail in this handsome, expensive production are remarkable, to be sure, even though the film’s meandering cinematography – as the camera goes ping-ponging about the place – tends to highlight the theatrical origins of the piece. Only one memorable sequence on a railroad track gives you any real sense of the city Cats is set in. Each year these cats hold a ritual talent contest, the winner of which gets to float away to their next life in a realm called the “Heaviside Layer”. Stumbling into this community of preening moggies is a discarded kitty called Victoria (Francesca Hayward). Innocent and wide-eyed, she sees wonder and enchantment in her new surroundings as she encounters its various underworld characters, both nice and nasty. There are a couple of notably bright and energized performances here as Rebel Wilson and James Corden chime in with some scene-stealing work and a few choice comic touches. Apart from that, though, it’s hard to get a sense of performance from much of the cast, thanks largely to restless camera moves and choppy edits every three seconds or so. For such a feather-weight musical the direction throughout is just too dour and the going gets pretty sluggish. It’s like trying to have a skip in your step while wearing moon boots. Fans of the musical will no doubt rejoice in the renditions of hits from the soundtrack such as Jellicle Songs For Jellicle Cats (a singularly irritating ditty), Old Deuteronomy, Magical Gus and, of course, Memory, the show’s signature tune that has taken its place alongside My Heart Will Go On and I Will Always Love You as one of karaoke’s greatest victims. Still, the joys of Cats are spotty, and the film is unlikely to make non-fans understand what has so enchanted the millions who consider Cats the best modern musical of the past 60 years. Whatever magic was spun on the stage seems to have been lost in the translation to the screen. When it comes to good taste in comedy, having fun with Nazis might not seem to be among the most refined ways to get a laugh, yet when done with skill, wit and very sharp satirical intent it can pay off in a big way. And it does in JoJo Rabbit, one of the cleverest and funniest movie satires we’ve seen in ages. Refreshingly daring, it tears into the nature of prejudice and how the young can be socially conditioned to become rule-loving racists. Taking several leaves out of the Mel Brooks Guide to Spoofing Nazis – and based on the book Caging Skies by Christine Leunens – New Zealand actor/writer/director Taika Waititi (Thor; Hunt for the Wilderpeople) wastes no time plunging us into the heart of darkness with light-footed gaiety. He introduces us to Johannes Betzler (Roman Griffin Davis), a cherubic German kid who is part of the infamous Hitler Youth, portrayed here as being akin to the Boy Scouts, only with guns and grenades. With only his mother (Scarlett Johansson) to look after him, Betzler is keen to prove himself as an upstanding and capable part of Hitler’s crusade. Alas, he’s an awkward kid and an easy target for the Aryan bullies who make fun of his unwillingness to kill. Thankfully he has a supportive imaginary friend who offers him sage advice about how best to make it in life. This figure comes in the well-dressed form of the Fuhrer himself (played by Waititi), an amalgam of Hitler as mediated through propaganda. He’s not so much a genocidal monster intent on ridding the world of Jews but an avuncular pal eager to help his naive charge fit into the New World Order. Conflicted as he is between his duty to the Third Reich and his nagging reluctance to want to hurt people, Betzler then has to contend with a major mind-bending complication when he discovers a Jewish girl called Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) hiding in his home. Worst still, he thinks he might like her. The eye-opening he then undergoes as he faces his real feelings and discovers his mother’s true feelings for the Nazi regime is handled with great dexterity by Waititi. Careful not to push the satire into the more perilous realm of black comedy – and this film is not a black comedy – Waititi keeps focus on the emotional growth of Betzler while pulling off some very funny moments, thanks largely to his a supporting cast that includes Rebel Wilson, Stephen Merchant and Sam Rothwell, very funny as a gung-ho soldier no longer allowed to fight on the front. At a time when the term “Nazi” appears with disturbing regularity in media commentary, Waititi’s film arrives on point and with a point, showing how socialised hatred depends largely on misinformation, taking advantage of the naive and restricting dissent. As for the supposedly touchy subject matter, Waititi shows here, as many before him have shown, that messing with Nazis in comedy sounds much more dubious and treacherous than it actually is. We’ve seen that repeatedly with the work of Mel Brooks, who gave us the classic Springtime for Hitler ditty from The Producers (1967; 2005) as well as the memorable Hitler Rap, which he put out with the release of To Be Or Not To Be, a 1983 remake of the Nazi-spoofing 1942 Ernst Lubitsch film that still stands as one of Brooks’ best. Jerry Lewis derided Nazis and turned Hitler into a comic figure in Which Way to the Front? (1970; admittedly, not one of his better films). It simply proves, as Jojo Rabbit does with such potency, that there are no taboo topics in comedy provided the intent is morally sound, the execution is rife with irony and the result is funny. The gang are back for more of the same as a gaggle of teenagers drop back into the Jumanji video game where they take on adventurous avatars in the form of Dwayne Johnson, Chris Rock, Jack Black and Karen Gillan. Made promptly to ride the huge success of 2017’s Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (which took a neat $962 million), there’s nothing inherently wrong or bad with the sequel, apart from the fact that it doesn’t really have a story. The only characters of any real dramatic interest are two old friends seeking to reconnect after a long estrangement (nicely played by Danny DeVito and Danny Glover). Everything else is a proficient retread of what we saw before, with newcomer Awkwafina adding a little spice and director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher) again doing a fine job channelling his inner Indiana Jones (his father, Lawrence Kasdan co-wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark, as well as The Empire Strikes Back). There’s plenty of snappy, cartoonish action, the best being a battle with apes as our heroes attempt to cross a tangle of rickety footbridges. It’s a wild sequence and incorporates a wily reference to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. Amidst all the movement, screaming and joking – the Rock and Chris Rock are especially funny this time around – students of modern cinema will find Jumanji II a near-perfect expression of post-content cinema. Set inside an old video game, the film often has the logic of a video game: characters die and come back to life; computer displays suddenly appear explaining each character’s strengths and weaknesses; plot hurdles appear then magically disappear. Again, nothing wrong with that, especially in this era where so much leave is granted to franchise fantasy films that push colour, movement and comic over-acting over narrative. On that score, This Jumanji is bound to please the legions who just saw the last Jumanji. How well it will serve fans of the original Jumanji is a more perilous bet. How is it that veteran British director Ken Loach can repeatedly make films about the struggles of the working class, yet make each film feel so fresh, vibrant and immediate? It likely has much to do with his love of documentary style filming and his unparalleled skill at drawing authentic, semi-improvised performances from his cast. On top of that, Loach’s films often point towards the hope of a happy ending for his beleaguered characters, only to deliver the hard life lesson that the good and the right do not always triumph. Written by long-time collaborator Paul Laverty and set present-day, the story follows the increasingly tortured travails of Ricky and Abbie Turner (Kris Hitchen and Debbie Honeywood), a financially strapped working-class couple with a bright young daughter Liza Jane (Katie Proctor) and a delinquent teenage son Seb (Rhys Stone) to raise. Up to their bottom lips in debt, Ricky’s plan is to become a commission-based courier driver, wherein he delivers parcels in his own van. He has a strict schedule to keep and a long list of responsibilities he must honour, lest he be hit with covering the expenses. His work life is brutal, thanks chiefly to his unforgiving supervisor Maloney (Ross Brewster), an efficiency Nazi who defends his ultra-hardline approach by claiming that he is helping hard workers earn a good living. Racing around the city with deadlines to meet and fines to pay for performance failures, the long hours and short rewards Ricky endures is intended to reflect the reality of this line of work. The end credits make brief mention of the many drivers who spoke with the filmmakers, their experiences highlighting the irony of supposedly being self-employed, yet having to work for an unyielding master. Running parallel to Ricky’s turmoil are the ever-increasing pressures on his wife Abbie, a nurse who has had to make huge sacrifices to accommodate Ricky’s van purchase. Her devotion to her work comes under painful strain as their domestic situation deteriorates with Seb’s truancy and petty crime threatening his future. Shining like a tiny LED light of hope through all this is their pre-teen daughter Liza Jane, a smart girl who watches the home-made mayhem with the silent intuition that they all deserve better. The emotional push and pull of the story sees Loach (now 83) in his element as the couple try fending off misery and strive to build some sort of future for their children. Like so many of his contemporary films, it’s touching, heart-breaking and all too real. A life-long union man, Loach has never hidden his allegiance to the Left. Most of his films are politically charged, implicitly or explicitly railing against the oppressors of the working class, the elites and opportunists who exploit without conscience. Yet, film after film, it is the humanism of Loach’s work that hits home. Though driven by politics, what he delivers is pure, heartfelt drama that stings with authenticity. As we merrily Morris-dance towards the New Year and all of the joys that it shall bring, we need to take pause and acknowledge what an absolute banner year it has been for Australian film, both aesthetically and commercially – though, not necessarily at the same time. Ride Like a Girl: Rachel Griffiths’ crowd-pleasing biographical drama about barrier-breaking jockey Michelle Payne was the biggest Aussie film of the year, taking a sweet $10.7 million (and counting). An uplifting, family-friendly, against-the-odds girl power film, it also achieved a rare feat for a local film by opening at #1, knocking off Downton Abbey. What a lovely sight that was. That’s quite a string of box office success. Still, you can’t have a year this good without one or two anomalies, and 2019 served up a beauty. Easily the best film of the year was The Nightingale, written and directed by Jennifer Kent (The Babadook). Set in colonial Tasmania it served up a brutally effective revenge drama as a woman heads into the wilds with an indigenous tracker in hot-blooded pursuit of the English officer who killed her family. Accomplished in every regard, lauded by critics and a big winner at the AACTA awards – best film, director, actress, supporting actress, screenplay – the film nonetheless struggled to find an audience, its box office straining to reach half a million. In a similar vein, the clever dark comedy Judy & Punch got strong reviews and collected a swag of AACTA nominations. Written and directed by Mirrah Foulkes – and widely described, as was Nightingale, as a feminist revenge film – it was lavished with praise and took out best actor for Damian Herriman. Yet at the box office it barely managed $75,000. It’s a real head scratcher. In a year in which so many Australian films hit big, how was it that the most acclaimed and award-winning film barely made a ripple, while another much-favoured film made no ripple at all. Go figure. At the arthouses we were blessed by some top-notch fare with the minimalist slavery drama Buoyancy, Thomas M. Wright’s excellent Adam Cullen biopic Acute Misfortune and The Combination: Redemption, a tough, independently made sequel from actor/writer George Basha and  actor/director David Field. More proof here about how good films can be produced on tiny budgets. Our love for quality documentaries was very well served. After That Sugar Film, writer/director Damon Gameau delivered the thought-provoking, optimistic enviro-doco 2040 while director Richard Lowenstein gave us the definitive Michael Hutchence documentary with the acclaimed Mystify. Each film took over a million at the box office. Meanwhile, Stan Grant and director Daniel Gordon got everybody arguing with The Australian Dream, their level-headed look at controversial indigenous footballer Adam Goodes. Careful to incorporate all sides of the issue, the film ignited a million debates and took an impressive $800,000. So, all up, 2019 was a banner year for Australian films. All we need is a few years in a row like this one and we’ll be laughing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the third installment of the Star Wars sequel trilogy, following The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017), and the final episode of the nine-part “Skywalker saga“. The film is directed by J.J. Abrams; returning to the saga after producing the first film of the Disney era trilogy, The Force Awakens in 2015. The film’s cast includes Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong’o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, Ian McDiarmid, and Billy Dee Williams. The ‘sequel trilogy’ cast get to further develop and finish their character arcs in a way that is very satisfactory in most cases and the cast are on top form. We also get to say a touching goodbye to some of our most beloved characters from the franchises history including Princess Leia giving Carrie Fisher the send-off she deserves after sadly passing away in 2016. Fisher appears in this film through the use of unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi which is well executed. This is possibly the most action-packed and fast-paced Star Wars movie ever made but there is still room for some touching moments and emotional beats; as the characters explore the light side and dark side that in inside all of us. Visually the film is at the peak of what we have come to expect from LucasFilm; effortlessly mixing CGI, incredible sets and locations in a way that feels believable and real. The sound design was also exceptional for this installment and sound is used to great effect at some key points in the film. A staple of the ‘Skywalker Saga’ John Williams’ score does not disappoint and ends his tenure of composing for these films on a high note. Many key scenes are heightened with John’s use of nostalgic themes from the previous installments that have become as iconic as the films. Without giving anything away there are MANY callbacks, easter eggs and cameos for fans to spot throughout the film. These references to both the saga films and the extended universe (Clone Wars TV show etc) helps tie in a lot of the Star Wars universe. Many callback scenes will resonate with fans touching on the emotional connection with these stories and characters, as this is the last film of an amazing 42 year journey.

"Dec 19, 2019"," Star Wars will forever be a franchise that has some of the most passionate fans. There’s just no pleasing everyone. The Last Jedi is evidence of that. Rian Johnson’s eighth-episode entry ticked off a lot of people for deviating from the original vision, while others appreciated Johnson’s attempt to “kill the past” and push toward something new. That’s ultimately what made the prospect of The Rise of Skywalker — the ninth and supposed final installment in the Skywalker saga — so exciting. It’s as if Star Wars was burned to the ground so the next filmmaker could shape it into whatever they wanted. The fear was that returning director J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens) would sweep up those ashes and patch them up to stick to the course. And while Abrams does just that, there’s a poetic touch to his conclusion that makes The Rise of Skywalker a thematically satisfying finish. At the end of The Last Jedi, the Resistance — including Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) — was on the run from the First Order. Masked baddie Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) was just spanked by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and he’s in search of some dignity. An opportunity arises when communication is being made with the thought-to-be-deceased Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Both sides of the Force are confused by signs of the Emperor’s alleged return and are trying to uncover the mystery before the galaxy enters the endgame zone. And that’s about all I can say. The most common complaint I’ve seen thus far is how rushed Rise of Skywalker feels. There’s a lot to wrap up. Characters often jump from one place to another without any breaks. However, so much is communicated visually. For one, this is the most expansive the galaxy has ever felt. Like Johnson’s salt and red dirt planet in The Last Jedi, there are more unique worlds that don’t merely feel like various fractions of Earth. There’s a slight pause on one planet celebrating at a festival that happens every 42 years (if I remember it correctly — and if that’s the case, that’s a subtle nod to the Star Wars franchise being around since 1977). The creatures have a way of life that would be fun to explore further. The same could be said on another planet that’s made to appear like Nazi Germany, with families’ homes being invaded. Visually, this is the most impressive episode of Star Wars. There are shots that are absolutely breathtaking, nearly feeling as wondrous as Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy. I could spend hours studying each frame to find all-new discoveries. For that richness, Abrams deserves credit. A significant problem is how much the film falls on being another fetch quest. The characters have to get something to get somewhere else. It’s a cheap trick that this franchise has pulled so many times, much like Johnson with the casino planet in The Last Jedi. But I have to admit, the game in Rise of Skywalker is the most entertaining of the new sequel-trilogy. It has the most meaning because the characters arguably learn more about each other and themselves. I’m sure there will be many fans who will pick Rise of Skywalker apart for forgetting X, Y and Z. There are many conveniences, but that said, I believe Abrams has wrapped up the trilogy rather nicely. There are cool nods to the entire franchise and thrilling occurrences that are so much fun. I had a great time, and if you can let your guard down a little and know that it’s not as daring as the previous outing (no justice for “Broom Boy”), you will feel its force of awe.

"Dec 19, 2019"," I think I went into this most recent (and supposedly final) Star Wars with the right attitude: I didn’t pin my hopes and dreams on the filmmakers bringing us back from the edge of the crushing disappointment of the prequels (and yes, I will happily admit that the prequels have a handful of lovely sequences in them, if you will admit that they still suck overall). My only bit of wishful thinking about episodes 7 through 9 was that they bring something new to the familiar settings and characters and give us some idea of how this far away galaxy would move forward once the so-called Skywalker Saga was complete. I’m not talking about setting up new sequels—I am firmly done with these stories—I just wanted to have an idea that the universe was in good hands. So now this 40-plus-year-old story is done being told, with director and co-writer J.J. Abrams back to wrap up what he began in The Force Awakens, and I’m genuinely stunned that not only did he learn nothing from the risks taken by interim writer/director Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi), but also that Abrams, in some cases, actively attempts to dismantle some of Johnson’s boldest choices—choices that needed to be made, if only to breathe some fresh air into this virtually lifeless nostalgia corpse that seemed more interested in parading a series of familiar faces and storylines before our eyes than in actually doing anything unexpected (heaven forbid!). With The Rise of Skywalker, you can almost feel Abrams and his team checking off a list of complaints about The Last Jedi and either ignoring them, undoing them, or minimizing their importance to the greater story. I’ll keep this review as spoiler free as possible, but I can’t promise not to dance around a few key plot points. I’m just assuming that the fact that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) isn’t fully dead isn’t even a secret any longer, and if you thought it was, well, an announcement that he lives is right there in the opening crawl. Not only is he alive, but since he was defeated at the end of The Return of the Jedi, he has built the largest fleet of Star Destroyers ever assembled. Apparently he’s been lurking in the shadows of the creation of the First Order since Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) was in metal diapers and had a hand in bringing Ren and Snoke (from the previous two films) together to worship at the altar of Darth Vader’s melted helmet. The film opens with Ren locating Palpatine with the express purpose of killing him, but when the zombie Emperor reveals not only his ultimate plan to beat the Resistance but also his specific plans for capturing Rey (Daisy Ridley) to bring her over to the dark side, Ren has a change of heart and joins forces with Palpatine, at least for now. Driver continues to bring a supreme angst and depth to Kylo Ren that is so clearly not in the screenplay (co-written by Chris Terrio, an Oscar winner for Argo), and if anything elevates this movie far beyond its nostalgia dry humping, it’s him. But Ridley’s work in Skywalker is a close second. Not unlike her Force buddy Ren, Rey is struggling with who she is, where she came from, and why she is showing signs of being the most powerful Jedi ever. Finally receiving some practical Jedi training, her power, skills and commitment to staying on the light side of the Force seem firmly in place. But when she receives another message from Ren, she returns to the hub of the Resistance and her friends Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, playing the crack pilot with a bit more humility and dignity than before). I was genuinely and pleasantly surprised at just how much Carrie Fisher shows up in The Rise of Skywalker; using unused outtakes from The Force Awakens, the footage fits in seamlessly with the story being told, without feeling crowbarred in. Although I don’t feel the film overall does justice to the legacy of the franchise, Abrams does a solid job paying tribute to Leia Organa, letting her go out as the leader and inspiration she always was. Old friends are back as well, in the form of C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), R2-D2, and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). A few new faces also show up with varying degrees of effectiveness, including characters played by Dominic Monaghan, Keri Russell (as an old friend of Poe, Zorii Bliss, who never fully takes her helmet off), and Naomi Ackie as Jannah, another former stormtrooper who befriends Finn and introduces him to a legion of troopers who defected from the First Order. Kelly Marie Tran returns from the last film as Rose Tico and is largely lost in an ocean of secondary characters. And the weirdest return belongs to Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, still suave and still a friend to the Resistance. The supporting players on Team Bad Guys fare better. I will always love Domhnall Gleeson’s take on prissy little ginger bitch General Hux, whose character supplies us with one of the film’s truly major surprises. My favorite new addition to the saga is Richard E. Grant as General Pryde, a First Order leader who has secretly been taking orders from Palpatine. Grant can play charming and personable so convincingly, but when he turns his acting powers to evil, he’s magnificent. I’m guessing any other surprise appearances in Skywalker are ones I’m not supposed to mention, and so I won’t for now. Ignoring specific plot points for now, it should come as no surprise that Rey finds a reason to confront both Kylo Ren and eventually the Emperor, and in doing so, she must confront a few hard truths about herself and where she comes from. In part of his dismantling of The Last Jedi, Abrams has now made the issue of Rey’s lineage important again after Rian Johnson thought it best not to get caught up in such meaningless devices. By saying that Rey’s parents were just ordinary people, Johnson emphasizes that anyone can be a hero and not just the son or daughter of someone powerful. I guess Abrams didn’t agree, but tying her to nostalgia does nothing to make the character any more interesting or meaningful, and it takes a great deal of the potential kick of this movie right out of it. All of that being said, The Rise of Skywalker is a stunning, often haunting, movie in a visual sense. Abrams has designed certain sequences almost like horror movie set pieces, especially in the realm that surrounds Palpatine. The action sequences are also spectacular, but action has never been an issue with Abrams, as he’s proven in one other Star Wars film and two Star Trek movies. His bigger issue is caring too much about what other people think and trying to please everyone, especially the most vocal among fanbases.  I still don’t know what Abrams actually thinks of The Last Jedi, and while his treatment of it in Skywalker literally includes a character saying his choices in the last movie were “a mistake,” he was given so many opportunities to take these films to new and interesting places. Instead, he revisits familiar locations and even more familiar characters over and over and over again. It’s like comfort food that fills you up but offers no substance. I think the filmmaker believes that by capturing a familiar feeling with his movies, he’s doing the soul some good, and that might be true for some. I’ve always been of a mind that such nostalgia-mining results in empty and lazy movies. I will give Ridley and Driver full credit for acting their hearts out in The Rise of Skywalker. I could have watched an entire film in which they were the only characters and been wholly satisfied. But when you bring back Emperor Palpatine, don’t have him simply spout out the same old lines about the Dark Side and have him shoot Force Lightning from his gnarled fingers; we’ve seen it all before and worse, we know it can eventually be defeated.  There’s a coda to this final film that exemplifies what’s wrong with Abrams’ approach to Star Wars movies. And while I won’t ruin the moment, on so many levels, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, mostly because I didn’t want to be seeing it. I didn’t dislike The Rise of Skywalker because I enjoyed The Last Jedi so much; I disliked it because I don’t tend to like any movies that don’t branch out from their humble origins and try to be original within the framework of a set universe. I acknowledge that Abrams had an impossible task in wrapping up these nine movies, but like many, maybe he needs to spend less time on the internet and more time remembering what made these stories special in the first place.

"Dec 19, 2019"," Making a Star Wars movie can be a thankless job. Reviewing one can be too. Rest easy, I will not be revealing any spoilers about Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker — and there would be a lot of them — but instead I am taking on the central questions for the final chapter in the nine-episode movie series: Does it work, and would it matter to fans anyway? Rise of Skywalker does work for the most part, especially for those fans who have come to expect big things from this series and might have been turned off by some of the detours the previous edition, The Last Jedi from director Rian Johnson, took two years ago. J.J. Abrams — returning to the director’s chair four years after helming the first Disney-owned Lucasfilm reboot of the iconic series, The Force Awakens, to good results — seems to know what the devotees expect, and he gives it to them. You can’t blame him and co-writer Chris Terrio for throwing everything into this one, even if you are not such a rabid fan that you don’t know where they are going or what they are talking about half the time. It still is lots of fun for non-zealots and comes close to capturing the awesome thrill of seeing George Lucas’ original in 1977, if not in any way matching it. It is hard to compete with Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford in those iconic roles, but a different trio who make up the resistance do their best and largely fill the bill. Daisy Ridley’s Rey, Oscar Isaac’s Poe and John Boyega’s Finn and the Millennium Falcon are on the trail of Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), the evil Sith who has re-emerged and now is known to be in a cave-like secret location in Exogol, something the Resistance is determined to find before the First Order can regroup and succeed with their plans to rule all. Palpatine sees Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the grandson of Darth Vader, as his heir apparent, and the movie opens in a very dark way, showing just how deep in Ren has gotten (he often wears a red and black mask in a bid to emulate Granddad). Ren also has a thing for Rey and wants her to join him on the Dark Side. She wants none of it, but complications arise. Rey has been entrusted with General Leia’s lightsaber in order to take on the mission that now is so important to complete (plus she has really developed some impressive CGI superpowers). The late Carrie Fisher is brought back as Leia with unused footage from the two previous films, and it works effectively in allowing us to see this all-important character one last time, and in a very poignant manner. Rest assured Hamill shows up briefly and reverses any damage to his character inflicted in the odd direction Luke took in Jedi. Of course C-3PO and Chewbacca and all those droids are still with us, thank the maker. (By the way, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO is the only actor to have appeared in all nine films.) It is also fun to have Billy Dee Williams back as Lando Calrissian. There’s even a cameo lurking from another fan favorite. Like I said, Abrams has thought of everything, even if there’s just way too much exposition — almost to the point I would recommend getting a copy of Star Wars for Dummies, if it exists. Of course the production values are superb, and the special effects better than ever. And it wouldn’t be a Star Wars without the irreplaceable John Williams, now 87 and still giving the Stormtroopers some glorious marching music, and much more. Producers are Kathleen Kennedy, Michelle Rejwan, and Abrams. Disney opens it Friday. Check out my video review with clips from the movie by clicking the link above.

"Dec 19, 2019"," ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is one of the most anticipated films in Hollywood history — and will likely prompt a combination of delight and disappointment. Delight, because fans of the space-opera franchise that began in 1977 can’t get enough of its fearless heroes, vicious villains and spectacular action. Disappointment, because how could the conclusion of the nine-film, three-trilogy storyline possibly satisfy such high-flown expectations? That’s a lot for a film to live up to. But taken on its own merits, the latest and presumably last adventure of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is at once thrilling, imaginative and surprisingly poignant. Once again, Rey and her companions are out to thwart the plans of the evil and oppressive First Order, which is threatening to become the Final Order. Longstanding questions are answered, with some characters dying and others turning up unexpectedly — including the main bad guy, who must remain nameless so as not to reveal a major spoiler. Indeed, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” takes quite a few narrative turns that are better experienced than disclosed. Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Chris Terrio (“Argo”), director J.J. Abrams — who also helmed “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” — delivers a story that’s at once an expansion and a summing-up. What Abrams lacks in poetry — one can only speculate as to what Alfonso Cuaron (“Children of Men”) or Terry Gilliam (“12 Monkeys”) might have brought to the Skywalker saga — he more than makes up for in sheer craftsmanship. Fans who griped about the liberties that director Rian Johnson took with “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” can relax: “The Rise of Skywalker” is the opposite of subversive. But it’s also more than just a corporate cash grab. The storytelling is solid, and at a time when the CGI in some films is downright embarrassing, the special effects are superb. A sequence in which Rey defies massive ocean waves to get to a crucial destination is nothing short of breathtaking. On the downside, Abrams is a bit too preoccupied with including references to previous films in the franchise. And it’s something of a cheat when a beloved character who has supposedly been tragically killed proves to be very much alive. As usual, Ridley is immensely appealing as a born warrior with an indestructible sense of right and wrong. Her expressive face lends the fantastical goings-on an emotional resonance. Boyega and Isaac don’t have nearly as much to do, but they do it well. And Adam Driver all but steals the film as the conflicted Kylo Ren, whose allegiance to the dark side may be in danger of slipping. For more than four decades, the “Star Wars” franchise has captured the imaginations of moviegoers who yearn for the kind of magic that too often eludes them in their everyday lives. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia (later known as General Leia Organa) embodied that magic. And so have Rey, Finn and Poe. The family of the late actor are getting behind a film project that looks to capture the essence of the Wisconsin native. Here's what we know. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," When Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi was released two years ago, it changed, if not created, the idea of online “discourse.” A surprisingly subversive big-budget blockbuster, writer-director Rian Johnson’s take on George Lucas’s creation questioned not only established Hollywood narrative structures, but the franchise’s beloved mythology and, in the process, infuriated the “fans” who most needed to hear its points. For months, it felt like all we talked about was TLJ and in some ways, it feels like we never stopped—not least because Johnson’s latest, Knives Out, is a direct shot at the often-misogynistic, often-racist and, unfortunately, often-very vocal fanboys who hated the film. Since the news broke that not only wouldn’t Johnson be back to continue the story, but J.J. Abrams, the director and co-writer of 2015’s The Force Awakens, would helm Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the alleged final installment in the Skywalker saga, those same vocal fanboys have been hoping he would “fix” all the things they thought TLJ “broke.” Those hopes got a boost last week when, in an interview with The New York Times, Abrams seemed to criticize Johnson’s film, saying, “it’s a bit of a meta approach to the story. I don’t think that people go to ‘Star Wars’ to be told, ‘This doesn’t matter.’” Putting aside the fact that it’s pretty rich for someone who’s spent most of their career riffing on Spielberg to accuse someone else of being “meta,” those comments seemed like confirmation that Abrams would squander all the exciting story potential Johnson left him at the end of TLJ. Indeed, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker not only largely wastes the opportunity to forge new ground left by the previous installment, but is so obsessed with its own mythology that it ends up being a barely coherent series of nostalgia-inducing but ultimately meaningless references that even a bad fan fiction writer would find indulgent. How you’ll ultimately feel about Skywalker should become clear in the film’s first half hour, as Abrams, who co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio off of a story they developed with Colin Trevorrow and Derek Connolly, singes the ends of every tantalizing plot thread TLJ left hanging. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, the focus of so much misogyny and racism that the actress left all social media, is quickly shunted offscreen to study old star destroyers, basically never to be heard from again. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who was left without a master to excuse his wrongdoing and poised to become a vehicle to explore toxic masculinity, is quickly given a new master so that the film can, for a third time, ask whether he deserves a redemption arc. Worst of all, though, is the moment we see Rey (Daisy Ridley) studying the aged pages of the Jedi scriptures that should have burned in TLJ. The whole point of Johnson’s story was that mythology and the family dynasties particularly integral to this franchise should not be prerequisites for heroism, so, it’s disappointing when the film’s plot is set off by Rey making a connection between the scriptures and an offhand comment made in a strategy meeting with Resistance leaders. Abrams, from his TV work like Alias and Lost, to his film work like Mission: Impossible III and Super 8, has always been obsessed with mythology and Skywalker is similarly driven by that obsession until it suffocates under the weight of all that history. The Jedi scriptures quickly lead to the return of old villains, which bring back discussions of Rey’s origins already so creatively ended in TLJ, which quickly leads to the same dark side/light side struggles Luke (Mark Hamill) went through—all of it peppered with images of locales and familiar characters included solely for nostalgia’s sake. Every moment feels like a retread of something before and worse, the film is so committed to hitting those plot points that the character work becomes non-existent, leaving the film a relentless trudge toward a solution we can easily guess. While most characters are just absent from the screen to make way for newer, less interesting characters, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) seem to have forgotten what they learned in TLJ altogether, suddenly reverting to the outdated and toxic hero narratives they grew out of. Even worse off is Kylo Ren, who spends most of the film looming in the distance, an inert and malevolent force until the film’s final act, when Driver’s acting abilities make up for the character development the script doesn’t bother to do. Instead, the only the character whose arc is actually written is Rey and Ridley is so strong throughout that her arc almost redeems the entire film. Rey, as the ideological synthesis of everything both Luke and Leia (Carrie Fisher, who appears thanks to movie magic throughout) represent, has always had a lot to live up to as a hero. And yet, Ridley pulls it off brilliantly here, making the task look if not easy, then like the culmination of three films of smart, powerful work. Rey is, in many ways, a living plot device here, but because Ridley has laid so much emotional groundwork over the previous films, she never lets the audience forget the character’s humanity. When we repeatedly see Rey be kind to every person, creature and droid she meets, we know how hard-won that goodness is after the hurt and disappointment she’s experienced. When she effortlessly showcases her power in a face-off with Kylo Ren, it’s awe-inspiring precisely because we know how she struggled to control and accept that power. And when the film reaches its climactic battle and the story’s epilogue, Ridley keeps the tone from becoming corny or letting us laugh at how stupid the twist of her origins is solely through how grounded Rey’s emotions feel. Speaking of that final battle and what follows, even for those not as predisposed to fan service, it’s deeply rewarding. It’s impossible to say exactly how without spoiling everything, but those final moments do feel like a beautiful and celebratory culmination of decades of storytelling. However, satisfying as those final beats may be, how strong they are only emphasizes how weak the rest of the movie is and makes you wonder just how much more rewarding Skywalker could have been with a better script. Return of the Jedi, Lucas’s original capper to his Star Wars trilogy, has always felt like a subpar follow-up to The Empire Strikes Back and the same is true for The Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi. Though Johnson’s film only became controversial because of the way it deliberately provoked people who needed to be challenged anyway, thanks to Abrams, it will only get better with age. Where TLJ makes daring story choices in order to make the audience think about the stories that shaped them, Skywalker force chokes the viewer with convoluted mythology, numbing us with nostalgia in hopes we don’t notice how thin the story and character work really are. And while that ego-stroking nostalgia trip is the whole point for too many, perhaps it’s time we actually start listening to the heroes we admire and ask a little more of our art and ourselves.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," CLEVELAND, Ohio — “The Rise of Skywalker” made me, a jaded and cynical newspaper reporter, tear up. Not in a “What happened to my beloved franchise?” way, but in a “That was so beautiful my heart is bursting” way. And I can’t even tell you the high points and gasp-inducing moments that provoked honest emotion in the preview audience. You’ll want to experience them fresh. I can tell you that this is the “Star Wars” movie we’ve waited for, and a return to the gritty, lived-in, slightly seedy old-school “Star Wars” universe. It’s a pitch-perfect final act of the “Skywalker saga,” a nine-movie franchise that’s lasted four decades. “The Rise of Skywalker,” directed by J.J. Abrams, also concludes the sequel trilogy that began with “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” (2015) and continued in “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” (2017). “The Rise of Skywalker” begins with the revelation that the presumed-dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, “The Return of the Jedi”) is alive thanks to the power of the Force and some seriously creepy machinery. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), commander of the tyrannical First Order, wants to kill Palpatine. He’s also trying to convince Resistance fighter and Jedi trainee Rey (Daisy Ridley) to join him on the Dark Side and rule the galaxy at his side. Rey stops her training to join her friends — pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, “X-Men: Apocalypse”), former stormtrooper turned resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega, “Detroit,” “Pacific Rim: Uprising”) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) — along with droids C-3PO and BB-8, in a race to find an artifact called a Sith Wayfinder that will help them defeat Palpatine. If they fail, the Resistance will be finished. It’s wonderful to see Rey, Poe and Finn — who were cardboard in the previous movies — finally become interesting, well-rounded characters in this movie. Finn is still irritating, but more in a big-brother sort of way, and we get to see his talents. Finn is the heart of the rebellion, the person who reminds us that there is hope in strength, and the rebels are not alone. Rey finally becomes the leader that this trilogy needed from the start — courageous, resourceful, kind and determined. The movie neatly resolves the question of why Rey’s parents abandoned her as a child. Driver has never fully committed to his role as the next Darth Vader-level villain, but toward the movie’s end, he has some affecting scenes. The Washington Post notes that Driver is having a moment because he’s starring in two recent films, “Marriage Story” and “The Report,” in addition to “The Rise of Skywalker.” Abrams — who also directed and co-wrote “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” — focused on making a cohesive and well-told “Star Wars” story that respected the past while expanding the universe. “The Rise of Skywalker” takes us to never-seen-before planets, and introduces new creatures, vehicles and aliens, but also incorporates subtle call-backs to the previous movies. Abrams’ trickiest job was dealing with the death of Carrie Fisher, who played General Leia Organa in the original trilogy and the first two movies of the sequel trilogy. Fisher died in 2016. Using never-seen footage of Fisher from “The Force Awakens,” Abrams was able to make her an important part of the action. “The Rise of Skywalker” does hit a few sour notes. I had issues with the way that the Force is depicted in a few scenes, and the plot gins up cheap thrills with fake deaths. But these are quibbles that will be fun to debate in the coming weeks. This movie and rest of the sequel trilogy served to fill in the “Star Wars” story after the end of “Star Wars: Return of the Jedi” in the 1980s. The sequel trilogy movies passed the torch from the cast introduced in 1977 — Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker and Fisher as Princess Leia — to a new cast of characters. “The Rise of Skywalker” arrives with big expectations riding on its performance with fans and critics. “The Last Jedi” was a critical hit but angered fans who didn’t like the changes director and co-writer Rian Johnson made in the workings of the “Star Wars” universe. Those troubles have been balanced by the excitement surrounding “The Mandalorian” on the new streaming service Disney Plus. There’s little doubt “The Rise of Skywalker” is poised to build on that. After enduring the franchise’s’ nadir — we’re looking at you, “Phantom Menace” — watching “The Rise of Skywalker” feels like an oasis in the desert. It’s an exciting, absorbing and emotional conclusion that lifts the entire franchise to new heights.

"Dec 19, 2019"," To follow a much-debated middle installment in a trilogy is a big task, and to wrap up a nine-film saga is a big task, and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is better at one of those things than the other. As a conclusion to the “Skywalker Saga”, it is mostly satisfactory, tying to together all three trilogies in a way that isn’t really necessary but sort of works anyway. But as a sequel to The Last Jedi it doesn’t really work at all. Skywalker ignores Jedi, for the most part, and when it isn’t ignoring it, it is undoing Jedi plot points (however you feel about The Last Jedi will inform how much you like these decisions).  The Rise of Skywalker is much more a sequel to The Force Awakens, which makes sense as JJ Abrams co-wrote and directed both. Also, just as The Force Awakens is a remix of A New Hope, The Rise of Skywalker is a remix of Return of the Jedi. To most fans, I imagine, this will feel comforting and only enhance their enjoyment of Skywalker. But it is a little bit of a bummer that a movie that had a chance to build on The Last Jedi’s big swings chooses instead to play it safe and stick to fan service and mystery box payoffs.  One thing Skywalker does that is WONDERFUL is finally unite the new trinity of Rey (Daisy Ridley, who has never been better), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac). They have such great chemistry—Rey and Poe have developed a super fun screwball routine—that it is just DELIGHTFUL to watch them together. (Also, they have such great chemistry together that you will never convince me that Rey, Finn, and Poe are anything other than a devoted throuple.) One of the best things about Skywalker is finally seeing these three characters share space together. Their energy fuels the admittedly rough and exposition-heavy first half of the movie. All that exposition is one of the not-so-good things about the movie, though. Skywalker is A LOT. It is three entire movies shoved into one, and it feels like Abrams & Co. only just figured out the story they’re telling right at the end. It doesn’t even connect perfectly with The Force Awakens, so you can’t say it’s a matter of just skipping over The Last Jedi. It really feels like this is the first movie in the trilogy where everyone is on the same page about who these characters are and what they’re doing, and it’s the last movie in the trilogy, so that’s not great. Poe has basically been a different person in every movie, and it’s really only Oscar Isaac’s charm that is consistent. And Finn has a new talent that comes out of nowhere which is super fun with the zero context and build up it doesn’t have. On the flipside, Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are still fascinating together, and their story gives Skywalker its heart. Now we must talk about Kelly Marie Tran. Introduced in The Last Jedi as plucky Resistance mechanic Rose Tico, Tran is completely sidelined in Skywalker. It is VERY clear Abrams had no idea what to do with her, or any interest in figuring something out. Tran has maybe, generously, ten minutes of screen time, and nothing meaningful to do. It comes off like they knew it would be worse to exclude her entirely, but still didn’t bother working out a purpose for her. There are a few moments in Skywalker that explicitly roll back decisions made in Jedi—a couple of which feel a little shady—but nothing irks as much as pushing Rose Tico out of the story. It feels like surrendering to the worst elements of the fandom. Rose was always a bit of an awkward character, filling the Rey-shaped hole Rian Johnson inherited in Jedi, but after Tran was treated so horribly in the wake of that movie, sidelining her here is craven. But that is The Rise of Skywalker for you. It’s trying to please everyone, even the most toxic fanbros, and when you get down with the toxic fanbros, you’re going to get some of that radioactive waste on you. There is a lot to enjoy in Skywalker. There are some big moments that really land with impact. There is an incredible lightsaber duel—arguably the best one in the entire series, more viscerally dangerous and powerful than anything in the overly choreographed prequel lightsaber bonanza. The way that Leia, created from unused footage of Carrie Fisher, is integrated is the most emotional element in the story. There are thrills, there are laughs, there are heartfelt moments. But there are also multiple “just kidding, they’re not dead!” moments, the exact same kind of cheap, manipulative, no-stakes storytelling Marvel is frequently accused of. Rey’s lineage is back on the table and it only halfway makes sense and wasn’t ever necessary, and I GUARANTEE nerds will get hung up on the finer points of her Force-famous relative. The ending renders her family moot anyway, so that was just a stupid mystery box no one ever needed to open.  But JJ Abrams knows how to do spectacle, and he does it very well here. He also knows how to approximate effective storytelling, so at least while you’re watching it, Skywalker is engrossing. But just like The Force Awakens, the more you think about it, the less it holds up. The Rise of Skywalker is an unwieldy mix of fan service, mystery unboxing, and actual, effective character moments. Parts of it work, other parts don’t, and the parts that do work generally cover for the parts that don’t. On the whole, The Rise of Skywalker is about as good as it can be, given everything it has to accomplish. I’m just not convinced it’s memorable.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019","...while it has some fun moments, solid performances and striking imagery, it's simply too procedural and soulless to be anything more than adequate.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," You don’t need a reason to see The Rise of Skywalker, but if you did, it would be Daisy Ridley. Her fierce commitment to playing Rey with integrity, intelligence and a total understanding of the kind of film she’s in lifts every scene she’s in; perhaps knowing that she was their best asset, the Star Wars gatekeepers and J.J. Abrams, this film’s director, have given her plenty. This is resolutely Rey’s film, and Ridley steers us through it, holding it together even as some of the other moving parts came very, very close to completely derailing it. The first two acts particularly hold together and are pretty fun, as they present us with the best version of Star Wars, which is three people, a droid and a wookie in a cockpit or skulking around an alien landscape, bantering. Those three are Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), and their scenes are fun, harking back to those moments on the Falcon between Luke, Leia and Han. And, again relying on proven players, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, who’s now 73) is given a lot to say. As usual, he’s the funniest character. But the third act is not good, getting into the worst elements of Star Wars: endless mumbo-jumbo about the force, family lineage, bloodlines, destiny and so many versions of The Empire it will make your head spin. The Big Final Conflict is a cinematic disaster; suffice to say that it all comes down to white lines spizzing out of the Emperor’s fingertips, and that, frankly, is bullshit. Among the good and the bad, Adam Driver does his best with Kylo Ren, but the material is weak; unlike Rey, the screenwriters simply haven’t known what to do with poor Kylo, and his journey is muddy and ultimately inconsequential. And that’s the problem with the movie as a whole: except for Rey, no-one’s really got anything to do of any consequence. The script chases itself in circles trying to give us an ‘ending’ where the actual story – the story of Luke Skywalker – ended ages ago, among the Ewoks, at the conclusion of Return Of The Jedi. That film’s climax, by the way, is shamelessly ripped off (riffed on?) here, and badly. Abrams, as he did with The Force Awakens, bends over backwards to service the fans (try that at home), resulting in some very awkward cameos. Besides the original triumvirate – Carrie Fisher here being played by, it seems, a digital version of her dead self – Billy Dee Williams’ Lando returns to actually play a part, but he’s terrible. While Ridley is in a Star Wars film, Williams acts like he’s at a Star Wars convention. Ultimately the third act problems of this film are a big problem. They end the whole shebang on a bummer note. When the film gets replayed at home in years to come, I reckon it will more often than not get stopped at a particular point, leaving the cartoonish Emperor to endlessly await his destiny, stuck in a cosmic limbo of bad make-up and itchy fingers. Weird… why is this blog counted for the RT score? Also, it doesn’t read like a 3/5 review. Anyway, to the point– I get that Ridley’s commitment to the role is praiseworthy, but in all honesty I found her overacting and overemoting appalling and off-putting from the first film, and she being the main character has definitely made the movies tougher to watch for me.

"Dec 19, 2019","As ""Star Wars""-y a movie as possible, bursting with droid, aliens, lightsabers, heroes, villains, and old friends to send the Skywalker Saga off with a...well, less of a pronounced limp than expected.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, from director J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens) and Lucasfilm, is the final conclusion to the epic Skywalker saga. The film stars Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E. Grant, Lupita Nyong’o, Keri Russell, Joonas Suotamo, Kelly Marie Tran, with Ian McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams. First things first, I want to be completely transparent. Though I’ve seen all the major Star Wars films, with the exception of the animated one, I would not call myself a massive fan by any means. I’ve enjoyed the movies, well, with the exception of the prequels, but as a whole, I would say I’m, at best, a casual fan. That said, understand that this review is coming from someone who doesn’t have extensive knowledge of the Star Wars universe. This message is mostly for the toxic fandom that is ever-so-present in this particular community and a reminder that everyone, no matter what level of fandom they are at, is allowed to have an open, honest opinion about the film. Now that we got that out of the way, STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER takes place a year after the events of The Last Jedi. To best describe the overview of the plot, I’ll turn to Wikipedia: “the remnants of the Resistance face the First Order once again – while reckoning with the past and their own inner turmoil. Meanwhile, the ancient conflict between the Jedi and the Sith reaches its climax, bringing the Skywalker saga to a definitive end.” As I begin to dive into my review of the film I do want to make note that tying together all nine of the films is not an easy feat and as a fan of Abrams, I have a massive amount of respect for taking on such a massive franchise. That said, as much as I wanted to love this film, I felt that it had the potential to truly shine but ultimately was a lost opportunity. Let’s start off by discussing the good. From the opening scene to the final battle, each fight scene was fast-paced and beautifully choreographed. One of my favorite moments finds Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) aboard the remainder of what is left of the Death Star as waves crash all around them. The moment is shrouded in a grey palette highlighted by both Rey and Kylo’s blue and red lightsabers. They both emote anger, determination, and passion as one tries to relinquish the other. It’s a beautiful and chilling moment that I believe truly encapsulates the entirety of what both Rey and Kylo have been moving towards. As with most of the battles, the visuals are stunning as well as the cinematography at the hands of Dan Mindel. The mixture of Mindel’s craft, with the visual effects used to create the final look of certain planetary creatures and elements (desert, snow, jungle, etc), really made those moments of combat feel grand in their execution. I think the strongest aspect of the film was definitely the more quiet moments of reflection. My favorite being when Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) land on the planet of Pasaana to locate a certain artifact that will help them locate Palpatine. Of course, trouble is never far behind them and after getting saved by a certain Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), they try to take off in a hurry; however, Rey realizes that Kylo has found her. As she goes to confront him (which is a scene that was featured in the first trailer), there’s a moment of silence as she centers herself and finds the force within. It’s a powerful moment that not only shows Rey’s true strength but also solidifies an important confirmation for Kylo Ren. I will say, through all three films, I’ve enjoyed seeing Rey as a beacon of hope and have enjoyed the positive effects she has had on women and young girls who have found strength and confidence through her character. At its core, these films have always been about Rey and her journey to learn who she is and what she is capable of, as well as her ties to Kylo Ren and the power that they both possess. In that regard, I feel like the film, for the most part, was able to bring their story full circle. I just wish it didn’t feel so predictable and vanilla. Now, let’s discuss the not-so-good. In THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, the Resistance must go head-to-head once again with the First Order. This is war. This has always been war. And for a movie that is wrapping up a 9-film saga with an epic battle, I expect there to be consequences. Yes, people die in war, but in THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, they seem to only be nameless characters that perish in the battle. It’s here where we arrive at our first conflict: there are no stakes in the film. Say what you will about The Last Jedi or Rogue One, but at least they took risks and didn’t solely pander to the demands of fans. In the case of THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, I was left feeling disappointed because I never felt like anyone was truly ever in danger. There were two instances where Abrams could have pushed that envelope but pulled back at the last second because god forbid you upset the fandom. This brings me to my next point: the Dark Side. The trailer gave viewers a hint that we may encounter Dark Rey. I was very excited about this premise because I wanted to see Rey struggle with her powers and the seduction of the Dark Side. Well, let me tell you, that most certainly never happened. I would have given anything to see Abrams lean into that storyline of Rey tinkering with the allurement that the Dark Side has to offer before deciding on which path to take. However, on the flip side, we have seen a huge transformation from Kylo Ren. When we first meet him in The Force Awakens, he’s prone to violent outbursts and childish behavior compared to where he is now in THE RISE OF SKYWALKER. Through him, we actually see struggles, regret, guilt, anger, a whole array of emotions as he fights himself to find out who he truly is. I’m not saying we needed to see the same range of emotions from Rey, but I do wish her character development in this film leaned more into toying with the Dark Side. Ultimately, that image you see of Dark Rey is a red herring, it doesn’t really serve any purpose at all, which is hugely disappointing. Finally, let’s talk about the fact that this film seems like a direct sequel to The Force Awakens, barely acknowledging the events that happened in The Last Jedi. Again, regardless of how you feel about the film, it’s still part of the franchise and still served a purpose. THE RISE OF SKYWALKER felt like Abrams was more focused on sticking as much fan service into the film as he could which resulted in a narrative that was all over the place. There were so many moments throughout the film that made me question the motives behind certain actions. Why did it feel like Poe had animosity towards Rey and Finn at the beginning of the movie? Why dive into Poe’s backstory when it doesn’t do anything to further the plot? Why did Finn mention to Rey he had something important to tell her and then never follows through, even after being asked numerous times?  Why introduce two new (badass) characters, Zorri Bliss (Kerri Russell) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie), and then barely give them any screen time? In the end, the film just felt like a smorgasbord of characters from all the films that were thrust into THE RISE OF SKYWALKER to make fan-boys/girls happy instead of taking the time to expand on the characters that needed it. Also, I found it slightly upsetting that Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) who was such a presence in The Last Jedi, got downgraded to essentially a background character. Honestly, that was probably the most upsetting for me because I felt like Abrams didn’t want to deal with the toxic behavior of the fandom and instead pushed Tran’s character aside. In the end, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER truly had the potential to be something great and memorable. I believed that Abrams had the ability to bring this entire story full circle in a memorable way but chose to take the easy way out. It’s disappointing to see the entire series end on this note when it has come so far. I’m sure Star Wars fans that hated The Last Jedi will enjoy this film because Abrams is spoon-feeding them content that he knows won’t challenge or upset them. All that said, if THE RISE OF SKYWALKER taught me anything, it was that The Last Jedi is a far superior film and one of the absolute best in the entire franchise. Even with all its unwarranted controversy, that film will go down as being one of the most iconic Star Wars films while THE RISE OF SKYWALKER becomes forgettable nostalgia-pushing fodder. STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER arrives in theaters on December 20, 2019. That’s not how it works. Toxic fandom is created by the problematic behavior of fans who become unhappy that their preconceived notions of how a film should be are not met. That’s not the fault of the studio, that’s the fault of the individual.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Welcome to my site! My name is Andrea Thompson, and I’m a writer, editor, and film critic who is a member of the Chicago Indie Critics and also the founder and director of the Film Girl Film Festival, which you can find more info about at filmgirlfilm.com! I have no intention of becoming any less obsessed with cinema, comics, or nerdom in general. Just when you thought it was safe to see a “Star Wars” movie...well, it gets sold to Disney like everything else. Then things really get weird, online harassment happens, people are driven off social media, and the fandom explodes when a director actually tries to do something different. So what does that mean for “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker”, the film that will (supposedly) bring the new trilogy to a conclusion? The short answer is, it's complicated. The long answer? Keep reading. While the good that's already been established won't be completely undone, there's still plenty of room to regress, and at nearly two and a half hours, “The Rise of Skywalker” has time. Anyway, they aren't the only ones looking of course. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is now the firmly established Supreme Leader of the First Order. He's still got that tormented look that's melted many a fan's heart though, only this time it's while he's surrounded by the bodies of his freshly murdered victims in his quest to end Palpatine and the threat to his power. Only it turns out Palpatine's got a cult of followers who worship him, and most importantly, a fleet of ships, each of which is capable of blowing up a planet. And since Kylo never seems to have gotten over those daddy issues, he decides to accept Palpatine's offer of help, even if he doesn't intend to obey his order to kill Rey. Yes, Reylo fans will have a lot to like. The relationship between Rey and Kylo, and their increasingly romantic tension, isn't just a major plot point in “The Rise of Skywalker”, it's pretty much the focus of it. In better times, it would be its heart, but the movie crams so much into a pace that soon becomes breakneck rather than brisk, the emotional core becomes somewhat lost. Instead, Rey and Kylo circle each other as Kylo attempts to track Rey down and bring her to the dark side. The timing for this was never going to be good, but it's worse than usual, since Rey might not just be nobody after all, and is having some very disturbing visions of her past and future. Needless to say, fans are catered to. “Rise of Skywalker” keeps the action coming, which is at times enjoyable, other times not so much. Plot point after plot point is rushed through, from Leia briefly training Rey, a group of former stormtroopers who were stolen as children, to Poe's shady background, none of it is given the time and attention it deserves, and would've been possible too, over the course of, say, a trilogy. As for the Force itself, it's pretty much reduced to a lazy screenwriting shortcut. By the time the climactic confrontation arrives, there've been so many baffling plot turns full of holes that effects take over where characters and emotional stakes should've been at their height. Most insidious of all is how much the female characters get cheated. To the movie's credit, Rey's vision of herself as a Sith isn't due to gender, which is refreshing in an era where powerful female characters seem obligated to have some sort of mental breakdown. Rather, it's because Rey must face the same temptations every Jedi has. Yet she and most of the other women are mostly shoved aside, or have a distressing habit of continuing the “Star Wars” legacy of great female characters dying on behalf of their men. This would be disappointing under the best of circumstances, but it's pretty disturbing when it's coupled with a fandom with such a history of toxicity towards women. And like all negativity that goes unaddressed, it ends up wreaking havoc on everyone. Throughout “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker”, you'll keep waiting for that moment. The one where your favorite characters are fighting evil, battling to overcome impossible odds, or just together, whether they're fresh from victory or defeat. But that lump in your throat, that ache in your heart that could only result from such beloved fictions becoming something more real, it never comes. Even if the new characters are the focus, they simply aren't given the same care as their predecessors. They were worthy successors to take over a franchise hungry for new faces, more hope in a world that seems to become more frightening by the day, but they simply never got the chance to really come into their own. Perhaps we simply have to look elsewhere for that.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Disney shelled out several hundred million bucks producing, shooting and marketing Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. All they got was a lousy mixtape of the series’ greatest hits because money, contrary to popular belief, can’t buy everything, especially ingenuity. The movie’s journey to the screen hasn’t been smooth: Fan reaction to Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi could be disgruntled and toxic, while Johnson’s successor, Colin Trevorrow, unwisely butted heads with Kathleen Kennedy and lost, which led to J.J. Abrams’ return to the director’s chair four years after The Force Awakens. The ups and downs left The Rise of Skywalker a project in need of repair. Abrams obliged, but forgot to bring the scaffolding. The Rise of Skywalker is a stew of ideas in need of an overarching recipe because apparently having an idea is insufficient compared to having all of them. Some are his own. Some are clear responses to Johnson’s take on the Star Wars mythos, as if Abrams thinks appeasing Johnson’s critics equates to making a fully formed movie. But none of his designs enjoy thorough development. They’re presented, then left hanging over the scenes and set pieces to follow. The parentage of Rey (Daisy Ridley), seemingly put to rest in The Last Jedi but hinted at anew in promotional material, supplies the driving plot. The battle for the soul of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver)—the struggle to turn him to the light or lose him forever to the dark—continues. Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewie (Joonas Suatomo) and BB-8 (puppeteer Brian Herring) bumble about and trade sitcom banter while looking for purpose in Star Wars’ grand scheme. So it goes.  The Resistance, those scrappy ragtag rebels, continue fighting the good but hopeless fight against the First Order, now characterized with 100% more Nazi energy. As they wage their respective campaigns against one another, Rey searches her spirit and looks for answers about her past, and in her search is joined by the rest of the primary cast. “I really want to see all the friends together,” Abrams recently opined. He does just that before separating them, as Star Wars movies have done since 1977. Whatever schemes he has for salvaging the wreck left in the wake of Trevorrow’s departure, he never commits to any one of them. Instead, Abrams ping pongs from the first to the last while superimposing that indecision on a blueprint of Star Wars’ past.  Maybe Abrams knows how well the original trilogy functions as a collected whole (even if The Return of the Jedi does end with teddy bears bringing down the Empire). Maybe, like so many loyalists of the franchise’s fan base, he’s nostalgic for George Lucas’ magic and enthusiastically believes he can tap that well to achieve similar results. That’s the trouble with blockbustering by numbers while juggling the many demands of franchise maintenance: Nobody has enough hands to keep every ball aloft and please everyone in the audience. (The emphasis is on “everyone” because of course The Rise of Skywalker, being the event picture of the winter movie season, will do quadrillions in ticket sales regardless of critical opinion.) That’s not to say the film is all dropped balls. When Rey and Kylo first cross lightsabers, they’re in different locations, she on his Star Destroyer, he on the planetoid she’s just fled from under his aquiline nose. As the Force lets people communicate across the stars and inhabit each other’s thoughts, so too now does it allow them to interact physically, and so they duel, each swing of their laser swords leading to cuts between spaces. One moment they’re on the ship. Moments later they’re on the ground. It’s a clever invention, the kind of nifty fantasy flourish that makes these movies worth going to in the first place. But The Rise of Skywalker suffers a dreadful shortage of beats like this, where wizardry and sharp craftsmanship cohere; for the most part it’s hyperactive cacophony, an unprincipled sugar rush through years of planning and pop culture terraforming, where emotions come and go and none stick. Rushing is what these movies do: They rush to check off the boxes of modern franchise filmmaking, each intended to satisfy both general audience and the core demographic at the same time, and they rush to claim the brand for Disney. Why else label The Rise of Skywalker as the capper to “the Skywalker saga,” a term coined in the last couple of years to unite the sequel trilogy to the actual trilogy to the prequel trilogy under the same umbrella? This is a film erected on a preexisting structure with no structure of its own. Slowly, agonizingly, over the course of two-and-a-half hours, the house collapses in a stream of Star Wars free association. At best, The Rise of Skywalker solidifies Ridley and Driver as movie stars. At worst, it ends this narrative not with a bang but with a recycled image from a better movie. If that isn’t proof that Disney considers this property more product than art, nothing is.

"Dec 18, 2019"," So begins the traditional opening title crawl for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The claim couldn’t be more correct. Despite many deaths, Star Wars has refused to stay quiet, speaking multiple times into the popular culture since the first film in 1977. Frequently—especially in the case of the homage-heavy most recent trilogy—Star Wars even nostalgically resuscitates its own corpse. Rise of Skywalker purports to be the final installment in the central, nine-film cycle, but I’ll believe it when I (don’t) see it. Nevertheless, an air of finality hangs over the picture, which gives Rise of Skywalker whatever intermittent potency it has. This isn’t The Irishman—another, far more momentous cinematic closing of the book from 2019. Heck it isn’t even Avengers: Endgame, which concluded its own science-fiction cycle earlier in the year with far more excitement, panache, and emotional power. But the film shouldn’t be snidely dismissed, despite its faults. With Rise of Skywalker, Star Wars limps to a close, but there’s still good in it. Most compelling is the continuing central conflict between Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) and dark side enthusiast Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who has consolidated power in the aftermath of The Last Jedi. Amassing a military force stronger than any that Rey’s diminished Resistance has ever seen, Kylo Ren aims not only to conquer the galaxy, but also to convince Rey to embrace her own darkness and rule by his side. The Romeo and Juliet vibes that first flickered between Rey and Kylo Ren in 2015’s The Force Awakens come to the fore here. Are they adversaries or star-crossed lovers? Might they be siblings? Cousins? Something else? Speculation has run rampant ever since The Force Awakens (I’ll save spoilers for later). Ridley and Driver—who both give operatic performances of blood, sweat, and hard stares—wring that tension for all its worth, while director J.J. Abrams (returning after The Force Awakens) emphasizes it in the filmmaking. Using their connection to the series’ fabled Force, Rey and Kylo Ren once again physically interact while in separate locations, including one out-of-time-and-space lightsaber duel that feels simultaneously like fighting and foreplay. (It also results in Ren losing the beloved mask of Darth Vader, his grandfather.) These are the better elements of the script, written by Abrams and Chris Terrio. Otherwise, Rise of Skywalker is a mess in terms of actual plot. It gets off to a clunky start, with frantically paced table-setting scenes that offer a lot of CGI and action but never really capture the imagination. The movie then proceeds to assign a series of busy tasks to its ensemble cast, who are sent across space in search of various MacGuffins, doohickies, and dongles. (At one point, they need to retrieve a dagger because it offers a clue to a “wayfinder” that will guide them to a hidden location.) After all that is accomplished, the film works its way to a convoluted, confusing climax that nonetheless restages the finale of 1983’s Return of the Jedi (more on that later). At least Rise of Skywalker keeps its core ensemble on the screen together, something Last Jedi failed to do. For much of the film, Rey is joined by rebel pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Issac) and ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), as well as Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, veteran of all nine films). Boyega and Isaac bring a crucial wit and lightness to the proceedings, including a very funny moment in which Poe (who has always been willing to be emasculated in this more woman-centric trilogy) wilts when his flashlight fails to measure up to Rey’s lightsaber. And yet it’s C-3PO, who has never been a beloved character of mine, who might actually be Rise of Skywalker’s MVP. The film’s most moving moment—the one that best incorporates honest nostalgia with immediate urgency—comes when our heroes need a crucial message that’s buried in C-3PO’s hard drive, but can only retrieve it by rebooting him and thereby wiping his memory clean. C-3PO agrees to make the sacrifice, and then pauses. When asked by Poe what he’s doing, he replies, “Taking one last look, sir, at my friends.” There’s both poignancy and wonder in watching C-3PO’s glowing eyes go dim, as we realize all the history of the saga that is fading away. Sadly, it’s the only scene in the movie that manages such a tone. As for the action scenes, there’s also only a single one that stands out (Last Jedi had far more majestic set pieces). Early on, Rey and Kylo Ren face off on a desert planet, where she’s severely outmatched. She stands alone on the sand, while he bears down on her while piloting a screaming spacecraft. Abrams comes to life as a filmmaker here, cutting back and forth between long shots of Ren’s speeding vehicle—gathering speed and closing ground—and close-ups of Rey’s face, gathering determination. When she performs a backflip over the ship’s wing and slices it off—captured in a single, elegant, slow-motion shot—it’s thrilling, as well as another example of the aesthetic scale of hope that the series has long employed: the good guys always have a chance, despite the oppressive visual odds. Unfortunately, the visuals in the film’s climax are merely oppressive. (Spoilers ahead.) After learning that she is in fact not a Skywalker but a Palpatine—the granddaughter of Senator Palpatine, who grew in Sith power over the course of the series to become Darth Sidious—Rey confronts him in his underground lair. What follows is that rehash of the climax of Return of the Jedi (which was already somewhat recycled in Last Jedi), as Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) urges Rey to give in to her darkness while her friends in the Resistance battle his forces in the skies above. A scene both familiar and confusing plays out in a shadowy, CGI cave. And while there’s a death (after much Romeo and Juliet-style dying and resurrecting between Rey and Kylo Ren), Kylo Ren’s ultimate demise feels weightless in a movie in which so many of those who have been lost—Mark Hamill’s Luke, Carrie Fisher’s Leia, even Harrison Ford’s Han Solo in a gratuitous cameo—keep returning. What’s missing from Skywalker—and what something like Avengers: Endgame emphasized—is a freshness of vision, a boldness in direction, a willingness to let some characters move on for good. The dead do a lot of speaking in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—often literally. Maybe they should have stayed silent.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Has there ever been a movie with as much weight on its cinematic shoulders as Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? The film, directed by J.J. Abrams, has to wrap up a nine-movie saga four decades in the making, reward scores of beloved characters with a satisfying ending, and bring closure to billions of fans whose identities are inextricably tied to the world's most enduring modern myth. And you know what? It succeeds. If you made a list of the stuff you want to see in the final 
  Star Wars
 movie, it's all there. Space battles. Raging lightsaber duels. A galaxy-threatening climax. Jokes. And plenty of seriously cute aliens. The problem is everyone has the same list. Which means the one thing The Rise of Skywalker doesn't have is the power to surprise. I'll lay off the spoilers, but in your heart of hearts you probably know everything that's coming. A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, a new evil threatens -- or rather, an old evil returns from beyond the grave. You'll know what that evil is if you've seen the trailers, obviously. The villainous Kylo Ren, now Supreme Leader of the First Order, goes in search of this ancient threat. In hot pursuit is our rag-tag group of heroes: Finn, Poe, Rey and Chewbacca, with their trusty droid buddies, fussy C3-P0, beepy R2-D2 and ballsy ball-shaped BB-8. Things are quickly off and running with a quest that takes our heroes to different planets, running helter-skelter speeder chases and searching dusty tombs for clues leading them to the saga-spanning showdown. There's plenty of running and gunning, quippy banter, wacky aliens and all the family-friendly adventure you could possibly hope for. And the hurtling action takes place on trademark Star Wars exotic planets, from a world wracked with raging tsunamis to a full-on Gothic horror hideaway, complete with jagged shadows and strobing lightning. But there's something off from the beginning. The new/old evil is introduced in the opening text crawl, but its arrival is just too big, too jarring, too darn weird to be thrown out there in plain text. If, instead, we'd seen this evil appear and then seen the horrified reaction of the characters, it would have had infinitely more impact. As is, the sense of revelation is dulled, like the film has fast-forwarded past the important bit.  The film stays on fast-forward throughout its 2 hour and 21 minute run time. Early on, Oscar Isaac's cocky pilot Poe demonstrates a technique called lightspeed skipping where he zaps the Millennium Falcon from place to place, never pausing for more than a few seconds. The film as a whole feels a bit like this, jumping around with hardly any time for characters or moments to breathe. There's always more. More ships. More battles. More backstory for the main characters coming out of absolutely nowhere. Stormtroopers on motorbikes, Stormtroopers with jetpacks, and everywhere you look, more characters. But so much going on at once lessens the punch. Many of the characters, new and old, simply don't have space to breathe. Even the core characters are pushed to the sidelines or shuffled off with inexplicably muted endings. For example, there's no reason to introduce Dominic Monaghan as a new member of the Resistance while Kelly Marie Tran's established character Rose Tico is right there wondering why this new guy is getting all her lines. Isaac and John Boyega's Finn get into the action, but Rise of Skywalker puts Rey and Kylo Ren front and center. The most completely satisfying -- and satisfyingly complete -- thing about the movie is Rey and Ren's tortured relationship building to a fever pitch. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver get the most room to bring their intertwined stories to a close, and that's what drives the film to its operatic climax. Amid all this, the late Carrie Fisher's appearance is sensitively handled. But there's no hiding that her performance is assembled from a limited stock of previous footage, and it definitely feels like Rey's stuck delivering awkward feed lines to set up each piece of recycled dialogue. Still, Star Wars has always been about characters who zip past in the blink of an eye leaving you to imagine their cool backstory. Which brings us to the very cool Zorri Bliss (Keri Russell), no doubt destined to have her own spin-off comic series. Also grabbing attention despite limited screen time are teeny technician Babu Frik and snarling old-school Imperial officer General Pryde, played with typical gusto by Richard E. Grant. But with little time to dwell on any of the new characters' individual stories or the core characters' relationships or the escalating visuals, it's hard to get emotionally involved. The stakes never seem high, the challenges never seem insurmountable, the odds never seem overwhelming.  On the surface, it's all there: the showdowns, the space battles, the historic characters taking a final bow. Stuff happens that's objectively spectacular and objectively kinda cool. Yet it's hollow. It's perhaps fitting that the film leads to the empty, echoing shell of the Death Star. For a movie that moves so fast, The Rise of Skywalker is frustratingly inert. The Rise of Skywalker has a job similar to Infinity War and Endgame, the Avengers movies that capped 10 years of the 
  Marvel Cinematic Universe
. 
  Marvel
 wisely trimmed the cast list to focus on the core players and their relationships. Rise of Skywalker just has too much going on to tie its endless threads together and relies instead on crowd pleasing empty spectacle. It all culminates with a finale that builds to an apocalyptic frenzy. This is as much a metaphysical struggle as a physical one, but despite the jaw-dropping scale of the obligatory space battle it feels inexplicably small. The Rise of Skywalker's climax lacks the nail-biting focus of previous climactic space battles.  After the audacious but divisive Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker will probably be a litmus test for fans. The breathless rush to tick every box on the wish list will leave some cold and others in floods of tears from the moment the opening fanfare blares. Whether it works for you or not, what's not in doubt is that this is an ending as huge as this momentous movie saga deserves.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," It’s astounding to read at the STAR WARS chapter of Easy Riders, Raging Bulls as the eleventh film in the franchise, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is hitting theaters. Conceived as a kids movie—director George Lucas once described STAR WARS as WIZARD OF OZ meets WILLY WONKA—the film became a cultural touchstone for generations to come. Of Lucas’ contemporaries, Steven Speilberg was the only one who believed that STAR WARS was going to be a hit. On May 25th, 1977,  STAR WARS almost instantly changed movie culture for better or worse, ushering in a more cheerful style of filmmaking than the cynical films of Brian De Palma and William Friedkin that had dominated cinemas throughout the ‘70s. After twenty years basically in retirement from filmmaking, Lucas got back behind the camera for his prequel trilogy that fell flat for plenty of longtime, older audiences who grew up with Luke, Han, Leia and the gang but spoke to a whole new generation…some who even fell in love with Jar Jar Binks. With THE RISE OF SKYWALKER, J.J. Abrams has the massive task of not only wrapping up the sequel trilogy that began in 2015 with THE FORCE AWAKENS followed by THE LAST JEDI in 2017, (and two spinoffs in ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY and SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY) but a nine-film saga that is arguably taken more seriously than some actual tax-exempt religions. The film has a lot on its plate and as a result, the final product is sloppy and overstuffed, but when it focuses on smaller moments between the characters, SKYWALKER, comes out on top, overall providing a thrilling if not a completely satisfying conclusion to the tale of the dysfunctional Skywalker clan. “The dead speak!” announces the opening crawl, suggesting supernatural evil from beyond the grave is afoot in the galaxy. Kylo Ren is on a quest to find the resurrected Emperor Palpatine (last seen being chucked down an exhaust shaft by Darth Vader in 1983’s RETURN OF THE JEDI) who has been pulling the strings from beyond the grave as he has done since 1999’s THE PHANTOM MENACE. Meanwhile, Poe, Finn, and Chewie are on a daring mission to recover information valuable to the Resistance from a spy seated deep within the First Order while Rey continues her Jedi training with General Leia Organa. SKYWALKER puts the gang on an Indiana Jones-style quest to find artifacts that will lead the Resistance to Papatines’s lair and finally put an end to the Empire, the Sith, and The First Order once and for all. However, Palpatine’s cult has been in hiding for over twenty years, building a fleet of Star Destroyers with the ability to destroy a planet (he has a brand) that threatens to bring his evil Empire to power once again. The opening moments of RISE OF SKYWALKER rattles off an overwhelming amount of exposition that’s tempered by seeing the heroic trio that audiences first met six years ago on screen together again after being split up for most of THE LAST JEDI. RISE OF SKYWALKER understands that apart from the impressive special effects and production design, it was the relationships between Luke, Han, and Leia that audiences responded to back in 1977 and a misstep of the previous two films was not giving the trio enough screen time together. The STAR WARS saga has always dealt with themes of friends and family and part of the problems with the cold, unfeeling prequels was that Lucas never really drove home the point that Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker were good friends the way Han and Luke became. It’s those human moments between Luke and Han, bantering back and forth (usually about the Princess) that efficiently paint these two men as friends. The three friends are on a classic adventure full of close calls and even quicksand and in that quest, essentially an extended high-speed chase similar to MAD MAX: FURY ROAD, is the heart of the movie and it’s unfortunate that it took until the third film of the sequel trilogy to put the three of them on an adventure together. The film comes alive when the ragtag gang of heroes are onscreen together, filling the frame and cracking wise. It is welcome, but unfortunately, the focus on the three heroes detracts from Kylo Ren, the most interesting character in the three-film arc. Adam Driver as Ren was the MVP of LAST JEDI, a tortured soul, aligned with the dark side but constantly being pulled to the light. He’s put on the sidelines for most of the movie, doing more traditional villain stuff. This reviewer was also disappointed that Rose Tico was sidelined, but in a film as loaded as SKYWALKER, putting the focus on the heroic trio was welcome. While Finn and Poe both get moments to shine, Rey gets to step to the forefront of SKYWALKER. At times in the previous films, Rey almost felt like she had a cameo role in her own story and the revelations regarding her family line are underwhelming (and a tad confusing) but her performance makes good on the promise of her character. As great as the new cast gets to be this time around, the best moments come from seeing favorite characters back on the big screen. Like Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill before him, Billy Dee Williams lights up the screen whenever he comes around making a terrifically on brand entrance for the charming rogue. His Lando hasn’t missed a beat, still showing up at the last minute to save the day, charming as ever, and delivering a classic line. Anthony Daniels as C-3PO gets to be involved more than he has in years, an integral part of the story, recalling some of the character’s best comic relief moments from the original films. The moments that feature STAR WARS veterans and the new class interacting provide an emotional resonance relating to the intergenerational core of the STAR WARS saga. In The Making Of The Empire Strikes Back, it’s implied that the 1980 sequel was intended to be sort of a “spooky” movie, and for a series of films that deal with space wizards and a fringe religion, creepy supernatural elements have been absent. The sequences featuring the resurrected Emperor feel like they’re from a gothic Hammer horror flick set in space with moody fog rolling in and lightning striking, the hooded Emperor creeping around his lair in a HELLRAISER-inspired contraption surrounded by hooded cultists. The return of Emperor Palpatine does seem forced, it falls in line with George Lucas’ concept that the films in STAR WARS are intended to rhyme and in the same way AWAKENS rhymes with the 1977 original (and even PHANTOM MENACE) and THE LAST JEDI rhymes with EMPIRE, THE RISE OF SKYWALKER rhymes with SITH and RETURN. To throw away that concept in service of being different for different sake would be a disservice to the saga as a whole. Looking at the STAR WARS films in order from PHANTOM MENACE to SKYWALKER, the specter of Palpatine has loomed over the saga almost as much as C-3PO and R2-D2. The return of Palpatine fully realizes how massive the threat of his Final Order is, giving an actual feeling finality to this chapter in the series. The sudden appearance of Palpatine in the sequel trilogy’s third chapter is undoubtedly a result of poor planning. It’s unfortunate that Kathleen Kennedy and her team didn’t take a little more time putting THE FORCE AWAKENS into production (and perhaps taken the usual three years between films that George Lucas did with both the original series and the prequels) to hash out a cohesive, three film arc for the characters. Of course, if you think that Lucas honestly had everything all planned out prior to STAR WARS, then I’ve got a bridge I’d like to sell you on Tatooine. As a result of poor planning (and these films are generally still being written in the editing room), SKYWALKER is sloppy, with characters coming and going, moving from planet to planet seemingly at the snap of their fingers. The film feels like it’s playing catch up for the run time, trying to wrap up as many loose ends as possible. There are moments where it’s confusing if Kylo Ren is indeed in the wreckage of Death Star II with Rey or if he is simply one of her Force visions. The action in the film comes by fast and furious, so it’s hard to get stuck on moments like this, simply enjoying the ride. Like RETURN OF THE JEDI in 1983, the film suffers from feeling rushed but there is so much goodwill that it’s easy to give the proceedings a pass and simply enjoy seeing old friends together one last time.  THE RISE OF SKYWALKER builds upon the arcs and themes touched on in THE LAST JEDI bringing deeper meaning to the previous film. A throwaway line even explains why you just can’t do the “Holdo maneuver” every time, similarly to what ROUGE ONE did, explaining why there was an exhaust shaft in the Death Star, addressing the theories of dopes who don’t know how to suspend their disbelief. In the time that has passed between LAST JEDI and SKYWALKER, Finn has grown into an impressive soldier of the Resistance and Poe is still working on himself, trying to become the leader that both Holdo and General Leia know that he can be. Meanwhile, Rey is still unsure of herself as her Jedi training continues and is almost defeated by Kylo Ren in a wonderfully sweaty and nasty lightsaber duel on the wreckage of Death Star II.  If the theme of THE LAST JEDI is that failure is a great teacher, SKYWALKER expands on that showing exactly WHAT failure can teach you. Audiences lauded THE LAST JEDI for subverting expectations, a notion I never fully agreed with. THE LAST JEDI cribs from EMPIRE and RETURN almost as much as FORCE AWAKENS does the 1977 original. But think of STAR WARS as a rock ‘n’ roll band that’s been playing for forty years. Outside of The Replacements, who wants to be intentionally adversarial with their audience? Cheap Trick has been playing out longer than STAR WARS has been part of the popular culture lexicon and their setlist is comprised of deep cuts, favorites, surprises, album tracks, but most importantly to some: the hits. THE RISE OF SKYWALKER attempts to craft a perfect setlist to cater to everyone who adores STAR WARS (even people who think the prequels are good) and for the most part, it works. Wrapping up a nine-film franchise is no easy task and while SKYWALKER doesn’t completely stick the landing, it’s not about the end, but the journey. From its first sequel, the STAR WARS franchise, despite what George Lucas might tell you, never knew where it was going to go. It’s been at times infuriating, thrilling, weird, and wild and the latest film fits in alongside as well as any film as fit into the STAR WARS saga. THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is a sloppy and exciting ending to a sloppy and exciting series and while it may not provide a satisfactory conclusion to the saga as a whole, but does nicely wraps things up, delivering some truly emotional moments for the characters that audiences have grown to love over four decades of moviegoing.

"Dec 18, 2019"," 
Back in 1983, burned-out after completing the original Star
Wars trilogy, George Lucas opined that he might be done. 22 years later,
with the release of Revenge of the Sith (and after being pilloried by “fans”
about the prequels), he said the saga was over. But, as a brand, Star Wars
was always too big not to continue, so Disney paid Lucas $4B for the
rights to his Galaxy Far, Far Away and proceeded to strip-mine it. The
so-called “sequel trilogy,” a once-mythological likely-never-to-be-made affair,
has turned into a sad swansong for a series once universally beloved and now
greeted in some fan quarters with shrugs. Taken together, The Force Awakens,
The Last Jedi, and The Rise of Skywalker are representative of what
happens when money – not a creative impulse – becomes paramount in franchise-building.
Rather than extend and expand a universe, these movies have diminished it.  To be fair to J.J. Abrams, he came to The Rise of
Skywalker with two strikes against him. Not only had no coherent umbrella storyline
been put in place for the series but one of his stars had died and the main
villain had been killed off. The resulting narrative constructed by Abrams and
co-writer Chris Terrio is a cross between a Return of the Jedi remake
and something they assembled as they went along. The movie consists of a bunch
of random events and, if you pause long enough to consider things like
plot and motivation (something you’re not supposed to do), it becomes evident
that most of the movie doesn’t make any sense. Add to that an anti-climactic
ending, scattershot editing, and too many extraneous characters and the last Star
Wars movie is the most bloated and least satisfying of all the main-line
adventures.  Palpatine has selected Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) to be his successor.
To aid in this goal, he has built a whole fleet of overpowered Star Destroyers
(each with Death Star planet-killing technology). He offers them to Ren in exchange
for a favor – that he kills the Last Jedi trainee, Rey (Daisy Ridley). Meanwhile,
Luke’s apprentice, having lost her master (Mark Hamill), is now learning the
Jedi ropes from General Leia (Carrie Fisher), who appears in a number of
awkwardly edited outtakes from the previous movies. (She speaks in non sequiturs.)
Eventually, Rey decides that she has to track down Palpatine so she leaves the
Resistance base in the company of her best buddies: Finn (John Boyega), Poe
(Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and BB-8.
Along the way, they are joined by veteran Empire-fighter Lando Calrissian
(Billy Dee Williams), who appears as a convenient deus ex machina. As if they’re
playing a video game, the characters find items that allow them to progress to one
level after another. It goes without saying that everything is pointed in the
direction of a Boss Battle with Palpatine.  The Rise of Skywalker feels like something that was slapped
together without much concern for logic, consistency, or coherence. Even more
than in The Force Awakens or The Last Jedi, the side quests have
little or no bearing on the final result. As in Return of the Jedi, the
scenes with the Emperor are the most compelling but, without the father/son
dynamic provided by Vader/Luke, the intensity is dialed back. And, while there
was an element of surprise to how the struggle ended in Return of the Jedi,
it’s straightforward and disappointingly predictable in The Rise of
Skywalker. When it’s all over, there’s a sense of soul-sucking disappointment:
That’s it??? The movie isn’t without its strengths and its defenders will
latch onto these. There are some welcome cameos, one of which is designed to
bring a tear to the eye. The visual Easter eggs, although minor, can provoke
smiles. In bringing back some old faces and places, Abrams displays the same understanding
of the power of nostalgia that he previously expressed in The Force Awakens.
The special effects are first-rate, even if their editing can be headache-inducing.
And, although this is by no means John Williams’ top work, it serves as a Best
Hits album, which is all Star Wars fans really want.  As has been the case throughout the series, Daisy Ridley
shines as Rey. This is her finest hour and best performance and it makes it
more than a little sad that the character wasn’t better served by the three screenplays
in which she appeared. Adam Driver hits his stride in this one as Ren, although
the portrayal for which the actor will be remembered this year is Marriage Story.
The expected, obligatory lightsaber fight between these two (c’mon, that’s not really
a spoiler) is among the best the series has to offer. Put it alongside the
Anakin/Obi-Wan battle toward the end of Revenge of the Sith. It’s too bad that the Star Wars saga has saved the
worst for last. Considering the overall trajectory of the series over the
years, perhaps a sense of diminishing returns was inevitable. One can lament
that the filmmakers didn’t come up with a better overall battle plan for the
prequels before starting filming or that George Lucas wasn’t involved but it’s fair
to wonder whether those things would have made any different considering the crushing
weight of expectations. Episodes VII, VIII, and IX chose not to expand Star
Wars but to provide fan service. The films’ questionable success in
fulfilling that mandate is the reason why so many long-term aficionados have
soured on the Disney trilogy.  For better or worse, The Skywalker Saga is over and I can’t
help but feel a little melancholy not only about the bluntness of that
statement but the manner in which it came to an end. At least the movie’s
epilogue is note-perfect, but that’s one of too few things that The Rise of
Skywalker gets right. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Let me suggest, if you want to get a clear read on a movie, not to see it with your dad, an 84 year old superfan. This was how I experienced Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, sitting next to the man with whom I’ve seen every Star Wars movie in the saga, from the first one we saw together in French, (La Guerre des Étoiles, or Un Nouvel Espoir) in the 70s. On the other hand, maybe that is the perfect way to see the last film in this particular part of the saga. Star Wars has always been about family, both blood born and made. It has always been about love, sacrifice, and courage. This new film, whatever you’ve heard, is no different. It is a rollercoaster of emotions, another love note to Joseph Campbell and his archetypes, and a celebration of The Force. Despite its flaws, if you go with one of your favorite people on the planet, and they love the series as much as you do, you’ll laugh, cry, and enjoy every minute of it. Isn’t that what a movie that comes out at the holidays is for?  I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention also that this particular release lands on the anniversary of the death of my little sister Jane from a car accident at age 16. It happened a long time ago, in 1998, but for the family of a lost child and sibling, the date, in this case December 17th, is forever changed and tainted. It took a lot of commitment for Dad and I to decide that we could go. We could celebrate Star Wars, and in so doing, celebrate Jane, who loved those movies as much as the rest of our family.  I’m not going to give any spoilers about the film. I’ll just say that it’s a film that makes you feel all your feelings, especially if you’ve already got a hole in your heart, and who doesn’t have a hole in their heart? For my part, I honestly really enjoyed myself, even if at one point tears were projecting themselves from my eyes in a horizontal fashion. I wager if you commit to going for enjoyment’s sake, you will, too. Is the movie trying to do too many things at once? Yes. Did I want to see way more Kelly Marie Tran and Naomi Ackie? Yes. Were there some people who would not have been satisfied no matter how this film was crafted? Definitely. Daisy Ridley proves herself to be a strong female lead we can all get behind, but hopefully so too will Tran and Ackie in future films. I’d also like to see where the writers take the characters John Boyega and Oscar Isaac have so beautifully brought to life thus far.  It feels like the only way to find Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker unredeemable is by walking in expecting it to fail, but fail at what? It entertains. It clarifies. It sweeps the floor on the way out. With Victoria Mahoney as the second unit director, it makes history as the first Star Wars film with a women at the helm. It even has a queer kiss, though if you blink, you might miss it. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," [Ed. note: This review reveals no specific plot points from Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Polygon will have more in-depth story analysis in future reviews and essays after the film’s Dec. 20 release.] It’s been more than 40 years since George Lucas launched an entire universe with 1977’s Star Wars, later styled as Star Wars: Episode IV — A New Hope. The film was an instant hit, in part because it was such an original take on familiar material. Lucas drew heavily on classic Westerns and Akira Kurosawa films to shape his galaxy far, far away, but he gave the setting a fresh and highly specific new face and tone. Aping the past while revamping it into the future has been built into Star Wars’ DNA from the very beginning. So J.J. Abrams’ finale, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, with its aggressive, relentless copycatting of the past, should fit thematically into Lucas’ vision. Back when the final Star Wars trilogy was about to launch with 2015’s The Force Awakens, fans were vocally nervous about what Abrams would do to their beloved franchise. He had previously resurrected the Star Trek film franchise in a sleeker, younger, much more foul-mouthed and smart-assed form. His alteration of the Trek canon included some major rewrites of beloved characters and a newly revved-up tone. While some audiences embraced the changes, others bridled at them, and openly wondered what Star Wars would look like if Abrams tried to give it an equally frat-boy-minded mentality. But Abrams took a different tack. The Force Awakens embraced fan nostalgia by re-creating A New Hope for a new era. Half sequel, half stealth remake, The Force Awakens introduced a reskinned Empire and a new Darth Vader, a gender-swapped Luke Skywalker and a modernized R2-D2, and a whole lot more familiar elements. Fans and critics alike were generally positive about the film, which set out to hand Star Wars over to a new generation of young heroes. At the same time, it turned those characters into fan avatars who thrilled at the chance to hang out with their heroes Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) — even as those older heroes were in the process of moving on. Rian Johnson’s sequel, The Last Jedi, leaned much harder on the “handover to the new generation” idea, with a kill-your-idols approach that subverted fan expectations and openly asked viewers to accept that the series was evolving away from the Skywalker lineage that defined Lucas’ original film trilogy. As a result, The Last Jedi has proved incredibly contentious, with detractors varying mostly in whether they blame the message, the execution, or both. Seemingly leery of that divisive response, Abrams steers The Rise of Skywalker straight back to the nostalgia-courting approach that served him so well with The Force Awakens. The most notable effect of that plan is that just as The Force Awakens mirrors A New Hope in characters, conflicts, and plot beats, Episode IX closely mirrors 1983’s Return of the Jedi, to the point where savvy fans could easily call out half the locales, enemies, and story turns well in advance. It’s a remarkably safe and timid approach, one that consciously reflects viewers’ cinematic pasts back at them, with a “You loved this last time, right? Here’s more of it!” attitude. It’s the rom-com method of storytelling, essentially cinema as comfort food: The story is pat and predictable enough to be soothing, and the surprises exist only in the details that mix up the story. In this case, those telling details largely come in the form of abruptly introduced new abilities that change the dynamics of a lot of conflicts. The new Sith abilities that drive the plot may rankle purists, but they’re part of the buy-in for the story. The new space-battle tactics are much more likely to frustrate viewers who remember past canon. And fans who raged over The Last Jedi’s introduction of heretofore unseen Force powers aren’t going to have an easier time with The Rise of Skywalker, which pushes the Force even further into the realm of “all-powerful, all-flexible magic bullet” than ever before. Those abilities come to Rey (Daisy Ridley) and, more notably, her fated adversary Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose psychic connection with Rey is used to keep the plot moving along at a breakneck speed, to force a series of confrontations that form the movie’s backbone, and to enable a number of startlingly visually playful meetings of the mind. The nonstop pace is an advantage in some ways for The Rise of Skywalker. It makes the film feel like a sped-up victory tour around the Star Wars galaxy, as the protagonists hop rapidly from one planet and conflict to the next, meeting new allies and worrying over past foes. The gasping pace doesn’t leave much time for contemplating plot holes, or noticing that the stakes feel lighter than ever, even though in theory, entire planets are on the line. It also doesn’t leave time for further character development, any form of nuance, or even a moment’s reflection on the passing of an age. The Rise of Skywalker pointedly opens with a series of action scenes featuring different characters in different environments, all charging forward with such a frantic, breathless intensity that the audience is blocked from wondering why or whether any of the action matters. And that energy rarely lets up over the course of close to two and half hours. All this charging about would feel more consequential if the characters’ goals didn’t feel so arbitrary. Early on, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio introduce one of the laziest of cinematic tropes: an all-important MacGuffin the characters must find to move forward. The protagonists spend a great deal of time and energy chasing this object, but they’re constantly interrupted by new and changing goals of the moment, which are often reached and resolved in a blind rush. It frequently feels as if no one really cares what the characters are pursuing, as long as they’re doing it loudly, quickly, and with plenty of callbacks to the original trilogy, from characters to situations to specific lines. The sense of a great deal of busywork being accomplished in an immense rush prevents The Rise of Skywalker from developing any larger themes, apart from the need to remind fans that they loved it when, say, Luke faced his evil cave doppelgänger in The Empire Strikes Back, or when Obi-Wan Kenobi posthumously whispered advice in Luke’s ear in A New Hope. It’s the first film of the final trilogy to lean on these echoes in place of any larger ideas. The Force Awakens was arguably about how history is cyclical, and the battles of the past will need to be fought again in the future by a new wave of idealists who may know little about the forces that shaped their environment. The Last Jedi was about letting go of the past entirely, and accepting that the future is more important. But The Rise of Skywalker is almost a meta-movie about how Star Wars is cool, and people’s memories of it are cool, and their ability to follow an endless string of references is cool. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) get their share of screen time, alongside classic characters Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), who’s still the endlessly belittled butt of derisive jokes, even as he briefly, hurriedly takes on his most central role in the series to date. Rose Tico, played by Kelly Marie Tran, has an insultingly minimal role this time out, but the late Carrie Fisher as Leia gets as much screen time as previously shot footage allows, and it’s a moving send-off. Yet they’re all ciphers in a fast-moving machine that zips from one planet to another, and from one space battle or lightsaber battle to the next, with little sense of impact. Some of those clashes look tremendous — one fight that takes place in the middle of a raging sea is visually stunning and weighty — but shockingly few of them really matter, especially in an environment where so many of the seemingly monumental plot developments are quickly reversed. Abrams and Terrio do attempt to bring scale and consequence to The Rise of Skywalker, but many of their biggest gambits are meant more for the fans than for the characters. At one point, Rey announces that she embodies all the past Jedi of history, while her adversary says he’s all the Sith that came before him. At another point, she returns to a beloved past locale from the film series — one she has no personal connection to, but appears to be enjoying entirely on the audience’s behalf. There’s certainly a palpable sense throughout The Rise of Skywalker that the creators are trying to revisit and pay off every satisfying battle and memorable moment from Skywalker Saga history all at once, by echoing them and turning them into a single symbolic conflict that can be repeated here one last time. That sense of repetition and nostalgic recognition dominates the film, far more than any single revelation or payoff. The message, to the degree that The Rise of Skywalker bothers with one, is that we all remember and love Star Wars, so of course we’d be glad to see it all again, remixed and revved up and delivered in an energetic gabble. But it’s bizarre to see Abrams and Terrio implying that even after 40 years of waiting for a finale, they just don’t have time to slow down, take a breath, and consider who these characters are, or what they’ve become after so many trials and traumas. It’s honestly true that George Lucas’ series kickoff A New Hope, with its tremendous creativity and its tremendous legacy, holds more cultural weight than anything the series is doing today. So repeatedly referencing and recapitulating that film and its direct sequels may feel more significant, and more fan-friendly, than striking out with an original vision. But having the people in charge of Star Wars’ legacy acknowledging their own inability to move forward is a sad way for the story to end. Even as The Rise of Skywalker’s characters claim their ultimate triumph, the film feels clumsy, hurried, and above all, like an admission of creative defeat. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," I’m a casual yet longtime Star Wars fan. I’ve seen every Star Wars movie, although it’s only the films that make up the original trilogy that I’ve watched multiple times. Those remain my favorites, in particular Star Wars IV: A New Hope as I can vividly recall standing in line outside the theater for a screening before Star Wars mania had swept the planet. And here’s a further bit of insight into my view of the Star Wars film franchise. Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens was just A New Hope with different characters and less energy and enthusiasm. Solo: A Star Wars Story was a disappointing cash grab. I enjoyed Star Wars: Episode VIII – The Last Jedi and applauded Rian Johnson for throwing in twists we didn’t see coming. And Rogue One earned a B+ because it made me believe there’s still artistic life left in this 40+ year-old franchise. Is Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker a perfect ending to the convoluted, sprawling Skywalker saga? No. Is it entertaining? Absolutely, albeit less so if you’re aware of what is Star Wars canon or if you enter the theater with a preconceived idea of who should “rise” at the film’s conclusion. J.J. Abrams, director of Star Wars: Episode VII – The Force Awakens, returned to helm this final chapter of the Skywalker story. Although I can’t recall a single lens flare, The Rise of Skywalker feels like a J.J. Abrams production. Once that iconic opening crawl is off the screen, the action is pretty much non-stop for the next 150+ minutes. (Which is about 20 minutes too long.) The Rise of Skywalker is a galaxy-wide scavenger hunt that truly only the writers fully understand the meaning behind. Who’s where when and why doesn’t make as much difference as making sure the elaborate journey to get from Point A to B to C and so on down through the alphabet is as weird and wild as possible. It’s one mad dash to some far away but easily accessible planet after another, all while Rey (Daisy Ridley) struggles to come to terms with what it means to be a Jedi and what exactly is her relationship with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). There’s an ever-shifting game of cat and mouse going on between Rey and Ren over the course of the film, with the identity of who’s the cat and who’s the mouse fluctuating and fluid. Ultimately both could be considered “cats,” I guess, but let’s not get sidetracked by going down that path. Star Wars: Episode IX takes a few swipes at Star Wars: Episode VIII, one so incredibly obvious it’s actually shocking the dialogue made the final cut. And as expected, screenwriters Abrams and Chris Terrio (Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice) attempted to fulfill as many fan fiction fantasies as possible with this chapter while keeping in mind this is a Disney property now and there are certain expectations from being a part of the Mouse House legacy. That said, Abrams did work in a first for a Star Wars film, subtly breaking down a barrier that should have been smashed in a much more obvious manner in The Rise of Skywalker. (Keeping this spoiler-free is a real struggle.) It’s wonderful, and heartbreaking at the same time, to have Carrie Fisher as General Leia Organa via unused footage incorporated into this final Skywalker tale. Leia’s a pivotal part of this finale, as she should be. Other familiar faces (and voices) pop in to help Rey on her journey and to assist Ren in his struggle to understand and perhaps change his fate. Billy Dee Williams’ first appearance on screen as Lando Calrissian earned a hearty round of applause from the press at the screening I attended, and Williams’ performance evokes memories of the good times had when Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher led us on adventures in a galaxy far, far away. Another old face from the past also checks in for Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker: Emperor Palpatine, brought to life once again by Ian McDiarmid. Kylo Ren and his redesigned red-veined Darth Vader mask have nothing on the sheer evilness and intimidation in Palpatine’s glare as portrayed by McDiarmid. Palpatine’s return isn’t as jarring story-wise as might be expected, and it makes sense that he’s the ultimate villain in a film that finishes up the Skywalker saga. Guiding us through the intergalactic treasure hunt are Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega). Isaac and Boyega have terrific bro chemistry and play so well off each other it’s tragic Abrams and Terrio didn’t manage to shove a few more scenes their way somewhere in the 155-minute running time. The few scenes we are treated to of Poe and Finn hanging out prove this twosome deserved more attention than they received over the course of the trilogy. And when you add Rey to the equation, the threesome clearly capture that difficult-to-achieve family vibe. But at the heart of Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker is the relationship between Ridley’s Rey and Driver’s Ren. Their connection – those intense, complex feelings they share – drives The Rise of Skywalker toward what’s guaranteed to be a divisive, controversial conclusion. Ridley and Driver are terrific in portraying Rey and Ren’s evolving relationship in a realistic, compelling manner. J.J. Abrams could not and will not please everyone with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. There are a few cheats in the storytelling, not everything makes sense, and some relationship choices made by Abrams and Terrio are – to put it gently – unfulfilling. Yet ultimately The Rise of Skywalker rises above the current trilogy’s biggest mistakes and corrects course enough to deliver a surprisingly hopeful and optimistic finish.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Big as a billboard in some places and as small as a mobile ad in others, the marketing imagery of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker touts the tagline “The Saga Will End.”  There’s something to be said for finality, especially with a 42-year-old franchise as venerated and cherished as this one. The virtues of remembrance, culmination, gratification, and other such lofty notions loom so much larger when an entity is billed to be the last of something important. Diving deeper beyond the basic “something that is final” meaning, the dictionary of this galaxy describes “finality” as “conclusiveness,” “decisiveness,” or “an ultimate act, utterance, or belief.” J.J. Abrams’ massive space opera follows his own The Force Awakens and Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi to aim so very badly for those traits. In many peaks of scope and emotion, his movie achieves such finality.  In others, overindulgence and disarray put question marks on the value or vindication of all this promised fulfillment. Going back to the tagline, the key word out of that poster’s sentence becomes “will.”  As grand of a finale as The Rise of Skywalker builds itself to be, the likelihood of its stewarding studio turning off this cash cow is zip, zilch, and zero.  This saga had an ending already in 1983 and another in 2005. Those had legitimate finality. Time will tell if this one, and its willy-nilly trajectories, will resonate strong enough or long enough to be of honored and revered significance. Announcing his presence to the galaxy (and to us immediately in the yellow title scroll), a resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has elevated the First Order into the Final Order with his Sith influence and the manufactured might of a colossal new fleet of Star Destroyers.  His orders to his acolyte, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are simply to “kill the girl.” That embattled female target remains Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has spent the undetermined amount of time since the Battle of Crait on the sidelines away from Resistance efforts to continue her Jedi training under the tutelage of General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher). As she continues to grow in immeasurable power and skill, Rey endures visions abound of possible future fates that hinge on an eventual rubber match with the former Ben Solo.  Matching a quintessential Star Wars motif, Rey has become the next emerging hero obligated to stare down the opposition with a will strengthened by summoned bravery.  With “never be afraid of who you are” encouragement, Rey’s fears are hefty emotional obstacles made thoroughly compelling by Daisy Ridley’s lead performance, her best in the series.  She may not be given the best scripted material (more on that later), but the actress squeezes every drop of rooting vulnerability out of this crucial plight. Long has Star Wars been about populating a heightened unity in support of influential individuals.  Call it amassing an army or the intimate recruitment of trusted friends. For Rey, her verbalized chant is the powerful wish of “be with me.” It is answered with “we have each other.”  Whomever stands behind the lead antagonist or comes to the aid of the lead protagonist does so with fervent dedication and multiplying motivation. True to this now ancient battle of dark versus light, not all assistance entering the fray comes in corporeal form. That said, no amount of razzle-dazzle filling eyes and ears can cover up the glaring examples of questionable creativity and incomplete development enacted by Abrams and lead screenwriter Chris Terrio.  Even in a third film meant to wrap up storylines, The Rise of Skywalker compels itself to introduce even more tangents and swerves.  It has characters that answer questions with more questions and moments ringing with vague parable rather than stamping cemented mythology.  The arcs for Ridley and Driver fare the best, but the periphery is scattered with superfluous glaze. The isolation elements of The Last Jedi slowed matters down to create tangible suspense.  This overpacked trilogy capper favors sprinting set pieces instead.  Moving at a rush does not automatically or always create one in return, magic be damned. To explain more crosses into spoiler territory, but there are downright mistakes here that expose the distance between forming merely a sense of finality, albeit a forcibly telegraphed one, and garnering a true, earned, and fitting consummation. Gauge all of this ambition straight toward the many synonyms of “finality.” Measure this film for “decisiveness,” “totality,” “resolution,” and even “integrity.”  You may find its force more thin than thick.  DON SHANAHAN is a Chicago-based Rotten Tomatoes-approved film critic writing here on Film Obsessive as the Editor-in-Chief and Content Supervisor for the film department.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars is a cultural cinema staple that has thrived across multiple decades and generations,  introduced multiple chapters and numerous characters not always to the satisfaction of its fan base. However, this fan was thoroughly satisfied and engrossed with its final saga The Rise of Skywalker. At the core of this franchise,  the ideology of finding one’s own path or journey with or without ‘the force’ has always been at the forefront of each chapter.   The Rise of Skywalker follows Rey (Daisy Ridley) on her journey to decide whether or not to relenting  from being a Jedi  and embracing her Palaptine birthright to sit on the Sith throne alongside Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is one she is willing to take on.  The chemistry between Ridley and Driver is palpably intense which makes their story intriguing and engaging to behold. A strong sense of nostalgia permeates with heartbreaking (yet limited) scenes of the late Carrie Fisher (Princess/General Leia), the return of Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian) and Ian McDiarmid (Emperor Palpatine), plus many surprise voices and cameos along the way that fans will lose their minds over. Director JJ Abrams had no easy feat being trusted with the final saga in a beloved franchise.  It could’ve gone terribly awry or become an unforgettable moment in Star Wars cinematic history.  Abrams’ screenplay (written alongside Chris Terrio) is a throwback to the playful humor, action sequences and emotional conflict that initially made us fall in love.  Oscar Isaac (Poe), Daisy Ridley (Rey) and John Boyega (Finn) have undeniable chemistry and comic timing just like the original trio of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. The droids (C-3P0, BB-8, R2-D2) provide even more humor, but some nostalgic, tear-jerking moments as well. Unlike the original, this chapter allows Rey to reflect the current times being the ‘best of the Jedi fighters’ despite her gender, but simply because she possesses the intuitiveness and skillset her colleagues recognize and respect.  There’s been the introduction of  Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) and Naomi Ackie (Jannah), to name a few,  as women who are smart, capable and forces to be reckoned within their own right.  In general, I would love to have seen more of them instead of stackable appetizers. At then end of the day, as a lifelong fan, I was emotionally distraught, laughed a lot and walked away feeling all entities did George Lucas’ Star Wars last and final trip right with the respect, frolicking and fighting spirit of wills we as an audience have come to know and love.  May the Force Forever Be With You on Christmas Day when Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker  and Disney spin into your orbit.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," How does one start a review about the end of something like this current Star Wars trilogy? Since the release of The Force Awakens in 2015, this new iteration of the Star Wars saga has seen its share of ups and downs, as well as fervid critiques about the nature of nostalgia versus change. In 2017, director Rian Johnson released The Last Jedi, the second installment that inspired a war between established fans and newcomers and, despite its box-office success, the hatred for it still rages heavily on social media. It is The Last Jedi that is at the heart of this final installment, The Rise of Skywalker, in that returning director J.J. Abrams (of The Force Awakens) comes in on his white horse to save the franchise from its previous brush with âwoke culture.â Acting like a hostage negotiator whose goal is to give the kidnappers (i.e., the fanboys) every demand they want, TheÂ Rise of Skywalker isnât a thrilling conclusion so much as itâs a remake of 1983âs The Return of the Jedi. You can practically hear the cries from Disneyâs corporate team, talking like Darth Vader throughout TheÂ Rise of Skywalkerâs 2 hour and 21-minute runtime: âUndo The Last Jedi.â Nearly every fan conspiracy youâve thought of comes true and thatâs not a spoiler but is telegraphed from the opening scenes wherein Rey (Daisy Ridley) receives visions involving her family and the belief that sheâs doomed to turn to the Dark Side. If this sounds like the plot of Frozen 2Â â wherein a young woman has to travel to find out about a mysterious force drawing her somewhere involving past family secrets â youâd be correct. Rey, along with friends Finn and Poe (John Boyega and Oscar Isaac, respectively) must travel to an unknown planet where the villainous Sith have gathered. At the same time, the Resistance, overseen by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher in stock footage) sees the trio as the last hope to prevent the Final Order, the fleet led by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), from destroying the galaxy. And as for Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), heâs still engaging in a love/hate relationship with Rey and, for reasons, grappling with his life choices with regards to moving beyond Supreme Leader. For a movie that was so tightly wound in the previous film, where divergences happened but the audience always knew the goal, The Rise of Skywalker aims to hit specific beats. Because the goal is to undo what came before, itâs hard not to see this as a âgreatest hitsâ movie punctuated by action scenes utilized to bridge the gaps between sequences. Rey, Finn and Poe are tied together this movie for reasons that extend purely to âbecause weâre friendsâ which does limit the amount of individual stories, but it ends up shortchanging the long-term effects of their actions. Considering how her plotline plays out, in one of the most frustrating scenes in a movie chock-full of frustration, the âfor Carrieâ thing is a baldfaced lie. Instead, sheâs replaced by living actors who, if you watched the last film, are there purely to give fanboys the warm fuzzies. Because of this heavy need for nostalgia, Finn, Poe and Rey also feel stock. A reveal involving Rey isnât special at all if youâve read any conspiracy theories since The Force Awakens and effectively situates her as another Luke (Mark Hamill). Finn, who went from coward to reluctant hero in the previous films, is bland and optimistic till the last scene where heâs teamed up with another child soldier to actually do something. Whatâs worse is, to kill off #FinnPoe hope, the movie makes Finn have a schoolgirl crush on Rey that comes out of nowhere and is brought up regularly as if to say, âAll man, baby!â Oscar Isaac is given a chance to be his magnetic, charming self, especially as he travels to the planet of Kajimi and reunites with an old friend named Zorii (Keri Russell). Sure, the relationship implies drug-dealing connections and, again, heterosexuality, but the two have far more chemistry in a movie that forces it constantly between its characters. Oh, and if youâre asking where Kelly Marie Tranâs Rose, the sweet character who anchored The Last Jedi, isâ¦.sheâs there. Sheâs there standing in the background, reacting to scenes. Really, sheâs probably only there because her contract gave her another movie. The hate for The Last Jedi is so high lines that could have gone to Tran â not big monologues, just âthis is what we could doâ-level lines â are given to a new character played by Lost alum, Dominic Monaghan. Abrams got to pay those Abrams-verse actors somehow! If you think Iâm being catty, Iâm not. This script course-corrects so heavily it sinks the ship before itâs even allowed to make a turn. Itâs as if to say nothing happened to these people since The Force Awakens, and thus their personalities are malleable when they arenât. They come off as hollow-eyed Sims creations for Abrams and crew to play with. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is made for one specific fan, and to appease them, it limits its storytelling and characterization to a sloppy degree. The cast is still able to keep things moving, but you can see the boundaries theyâre confined to. A franchise initially started for a new generation of fans ends by saying new fans never mattered, only those who were there from the beginning. Â© 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved.

"Dec 18, 2019","The film could have ended with a bigger bang, but it is still largely entertaining nonetheless. [Full Review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Acabada la proyección de la última entrega de la tercera trilogía o el primer capítulo de lo que vendrá, dos asuntos al menos quedan claros: a) Adam Driver lleva una temporada, entre divorcios, reversos oscuros de la fuerza y custodias pésimamente compartidas, realmente mala, y b) hay motivos para echar de menos, pese a todo, a Damon Lindelof o a alguien similar con la habilidad y la locura suficientes para dar la vuelta a todo. Nos acordamos de él después de presenciar la inteligente maravilla que ha hecho con el universo 'Watchmen'. Pero ése es otro asunto. El accidentado guión de 'El ascenso de Skywalker', firmado a dos manos por el propio director J.J. Abrams y Chris Terrio, es la parte más débil y azarosa de todo esto. Una ruina. Cada línea, de hecho, se antoja todo un homenaje al argumento 'ad hoc', al pastiche, al puzle arreglado a martillazos, a eso que los griegos llamaban pomposamente 'Deus ex machina' y que, básicamente, significa que las cosas ocurren porque sí, porque no queda más remedio o porque en un universo sin reglas el dueño del Scarttergories decide qué bicho se acepta o no como animal de compañía. Y si no te gusta... a 'Star Trek'. Desde el primero minuto, la película está ideada para la emoción del reconocimiento, para la clausura triunfal, para que la fanfarria quede para siempre tatuada en el tímpano. La idea no es nueva. El propio J.J. Abrams en su brillante comienzo en 'El despertar de la fuerza' se limitó a repetir la película original, la del 77, plano a plano, emoción a emoción. Era muy consciente de que de lo que se trataba no era de inventar nada, sino de reconstruir el espíritu perdido de una saga. Los nuevos personajes hacían acto de presencia y en seguida vibraban en la misma longitud de onda que los Leia, Solo, Luke y compañía de toda la vida. Lo que importaba era confeccionar y levantar desde sus cenizas un ejercicio de memoria que, aceptémoslo, también lo era de márketing. Más que a contemplar nada, a 'Star Wars' se iba a vivir dentro de cada plano. Y acertó. Esta vez el recurso es parecido. Si no simplemente igual. Ahora la idea es completar un recorrido sentimental en el que el espectador ha de hacer suyo cada gesto, cada sacrificio, cada muerte (que las hay) y cada resurrección (que también). Para ello, Abrams recurre a la pieza sobre la que descansa todo: el momento en el que Darth Vader descubría a Luke tiempo atrás su paternidad; un instante 'rosa' que se ocultó a los mismos actores en el rodaje. Todavía algunos no nos hemos recuperado del susto. Digamos que las sorpresas paterno-filiales son ahora la clave de bóveda de todo. No descubrimos nada. Al fin y al cabo, el misterio y gracia de toda esta última serie consiste en averiguar de quién es hija Rey, la mujer sin apellidos. La cinta, en consecuencia, se comparta como un melodrama de sobremesa, de revelación en revelación, que para sí quisiera 'Sálvame Deluxe'. Por un momento, de puro disparate, hay que reconocer que el asunto da la vuelta. Pero hay más. Mucho más. Y esto es lo bueno. Abrams concibe una inagotable secuencia de idas y venidas por el núcleo y el extrarradio de un universo cuyo centro, como saben, está en todas partes y cualquiera de sus puntos se localiza en su superficie. Y aquí, sin duda, el placer. 'El ascenso de Skywalker' se modula entre la oscuridad y el gozo desinhibido con una gracia perfectamente reconocible ante la que no queda otra que, como toca, llorar. O reír, que es lo mismo, pero al revés. Volvemos a estar donde siempre. Era esto. Llegado un momento, cuando uno se relaja, ya da igual qué nuevo giro o qué nuevo zombi (hay muchos) va a hacer acto de presencia. Lo que cuenta es la certeza limpia y casi pretecnológica del bien enfrentado al mal, de la amistad en velocidad de curvatura (con perdón), de la federación de libres e iguales frente al imperio de la caspa y la oscuridad. Sí, una vez más, ganan los 'progres'. Es decir, los buenos.  Y de esta guisa y de la mano de una descomunal Daisy Ridley (ella sí), el director insiste durante todo lo que dura la película en el valor de la memoria, de la memoria compartida y, más importante aún, de la memoria elegida y construida. Uno escoge a sus amigos, a los Beatles por delante de los Stones y a las galaxias lejanas antes que al espacio como última frontera. Y sobre ese argumento, Abrams se hace fuerte y levanta un laberinto de reflejos tan poco sutil como efectivo. Sin riesgos, eso sí. Otra cosa es ese feo vicio de la nostalgia convertida en mercancía, que también. Abrams no ha querido (o no ha sido capaz, según se mire) completar el giro que iniciara Rian Johnson en la anterior entrega, donde la reglas, por así decirlo, de 'Star Wars' eran tensadas hasta muy cerca del más delirante y gozoso disparate. Hasta se atrevió a crear una línea argumental que no iba a ningún lado. Y eso insuflaba una nueva energía al conjunto y ampliaba la superficie de última dispersión de las galaxias. Ahora, todo vuelve a su ser y el espíritu se mantiene incólume con el peligro que eso conlleva de acercarse a la torpe repetición de la simple fórmula y, por añadidura, de la franquicia sobrevenida. No llega a tanto, pero se echa en falta más reposo, más claridad, menos aturullamiento-porque-sí. Al fin y al cabo, el Scattergories es de todos. Una de las anécdotas más repetidas y que traíamos a colación en estas mismas páginas (o lo que sea) este mismo martes, es la de la caja vacía. Cuando la fábrica de juguetes que servía los muñecos de la primera entrega se quedó sin existencias ante la irrefrenable demanda, empezó a entregar embalajes sin muñecos como vale de compra. Pues bien, esa caja vacía es el mejor ejemplo de la ansiedad mezclada con placer que siempre ha procurado 'Star Wars'. Y nadie como Abrams para construir cajas vacías. El problema es que esta vez se la va mano. El vacío es excesivo quizá. Esta trilogía apócrifa ha sido un desproposito de principio a fin, su argumento principal no era terminar la historia, sino ser un vehiculo para el lucimiento de los ideales de la tercera ola del movimiento feminista, sin ningun respeto por las ideas de George Lucas (A quien ni siquiera invitaron a la premiere) y, cuando se sacrifica la historia y los personajes en el altar de la supremacia ideológica, tanto la historia como los personajes no pueden sino ser malos.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," At this stage, Star Wars is the movie franchise that ate itself. However, this final part of the rebooted trilogy does rediscover a sense of adventure and maybe even a sense of wonder. I have a bad feeling about this... There, in the now iconic opening scroll of the new Star Wars movie, is a mention of a ""phantom emperor""... Un-oh. Can Jar Jar Binks be far behind? That's the thing about this trilogy reboot of the second most successful film franchise ever - how many more archaeological digs can they do on the source material before it becomes one long exercise in fanboy and girl nostalgia? J.J. Abrams is back on board as director for this final chapter and there is a sense of righting the ship after The Last Jedi, a good film which nevertheless appalled the faithful by having the cheek to try something different. This is a Star Wars movie about redemption, learning to let go, identity and coming home. Fan boys and girls will love it. The naysayers should sit back and just enjoy the pure spectacle of it all. Scene set by that opening scroll, we are in a whole new galaxy of darkness. Forget all that talk about the First Order; now it’s all about the Final Order, which just might be the evil empire to end all evil empires. Millions of light years away in an uncharted corner of the galaxy, a dark figure from the past is plotting quite a comeback... Meanwhile, in the rebels’ secret base, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is losing faith as she completes her Jedi training under the watchful but bemused (well, it is Carrie Fisher) eye of General Leia Organa. In between aerobatic leaps and shinning up trees, Rey is also terrified by visions of her own possible future and this leads to some familial revelations that would be laughed out of a daytime soap script meeting. Sadly, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, turning the space opera pulp into spun gold) has lost his tantrum-throwing fury and resolved his daddy issues. He is far more assured and well, dull in his naughtiness in this movie. It certainly looks spectacular. Our brave crew of Finn, Rey, Poe, Chewie, BB-8 and C-3PO (RD-D2 has very little to do) sure get around in a race against time to locate a vital navigational tool that may foil the Final Order’s plans. They go planet-hopping, fetching up on a water world with a constantly-churning sea and a desert planet, where they crash what looks like Electric Picnic for walruses. Their sojourn here does have the film’s best executed scenes - a speeder chase through canyons, which is essentially a re-run of the speeder chase on Endor from Return of the Jedi, and a desert showdown between Rey and Ren which sees them locked in a battle of wills over a stormtrooper transport suspended in mid-air. We finally get to find out why General Hux has been so very fidgety in the first two movies and I’d like to have seen more of Richard E Grant, who turns in a fantastically lip-curling performance as the truly dastardly Allegiant General Pryde. There’s also a new droid by the name of D-0, who may be suffering from social anxiety but who doesn’t look like he’s going to swell the coffers at the merchandise stand much. You could easily make your own D-O at home using some superglue, an old rubber wheel and an anglepoise lamp. Abrams keeps up the pace in-between meaningful glances and military mumbo jumbo about weak points on Imperial star fighters, communication towers and pensive ruminations about the Dark Side. There’s not just a sense of an ending with The Rise of Skywalker but also a sense of fatigue that we have seen this all before, especially in the mad dash of the closing battle. The once awe-inspiring visual flourishes and world-building spectacle have become merely quick rushes of nostalgia. There is, after all, a fine line between the gravitas and profound Jedi-babble of Star Wars mythology and cornball sentiment and wooden dialogue. So after decades of intergalactic war and bloodletting family feuding it all comes to a end with a closing scene that may even leave you with a lump in your throat the size of the Death Star. However, be warned! Those bloody Ewoks do make a brief appearance.  © RTÉ 2024. RTÉ.ie is the website of Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Ireland's National Public Service Media.

"Dec 18, 2019"," The plight of the rebel alliance is more dire than ever. Supreme Leader Snoke may have been despatched by his disciple Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in the previous film, but he’s simply been replaced by an even more evil baddie from the past. Emperor Palpatine is back from the dead with an enormous fleet that’s about to transform the First Order of fascist bad guys into the Final Order – which surely spells Last Orders. First he wants Ren to kill rebel poster girl Rey (Daisy Ridley). Which begs the perennial question: who is she?  While the plot is driven by the rebels’ search for Palpatine’s secret planet, so they can thwart the fleet, the real business is on the human scale: the orphaned Rey’s desire to learn her true identity, the outcome of her love-hate battle with Ren, his need to deal with his patricidal misdeeds, the question of which Skywalker the title alludes to.One also can’t help wondering who’s going to hook up with whom, from a pot that includes Rey, dashing fighter pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and plucky resistance mechanic Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), along with a few, potentially romantic newcomers. It isn’t without hiccups: ropey dialogue, over-forced sentimentality, the frustrating introduction of appealing new characters (particularly Brit Naomi Ackie’s rebel warrior, pictured above) with insufficient time to get to know them. The first hour is a rush of action, some of it impressive, but making it difficult for the camaraderie of its heroic triumvirate of Rey, Poe and Finn to assert itself.  The film actually hits its stride whenever Rey and Ren share the screen, action and psychological drama dovetailing with the clash of their light sabres. Highlights include Ridley’s awesome encounter with his TIE fighter in the desert, and a thrilling duel aboard the ruined Death Star in a raging sea, with a shocking psychic intervention by Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher tastefully maintained by special effects) followed by a completely unexpected, deeply touching guest appearance.Ultimately, it’s Ridley’s film. She works wonders with the eventual revelation and consequences of Rey’s identity, while enjoying her transformation into a one-woman Jedi army. But Driver also does excellent work with Ren’s arc; rarely has seething rage dissipated in such a fittingly beautiful way. Other characters fare less well, and the bond between Rey and Finn that started so promisingly in The Force Awakens has gone nowhere since.  It’s hard not to feel a massive nostalgic lump in ones throat when hearing John Williams’ iconic score at its most rousing, or seeing a return to where it all began, the Skywalkers’ dusty abode on Tatooine, all those moons ago. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," After eight movies and 40 years, I think we can all agree that certain rules apply to the “Star Wars” universe. Death is a temporary inconvenience. Everyone in the galaxy is related. The Force can work miracles except when it can’t. No imperial stormtrooper can shoot worth a damn. Inexplicably, all characters are able to speak Wookiee. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” ticks off these tropes as if they were printed on a bingo card. The final entry in what has been promised — no, really — to be the last of the three canonical trilogies originally envisioned by George Lucas long, long ago in a Hollywood far, far away, “Skywalker” delivers it all without ever truly figuring out what “it” is. Arriving with a blockbuster sound and fury that has been dialed up to 11, the movie is a dismayingly safe act of franchise closure. In terms of pure narrative, it’s satisfying. What it very rarely is is inspired. What makes this especially disappointing is that the previous installment, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” (2017), took genuine chances. That’s why the fan-boys hated it, those diehards who saw the first “Star Wars” when they were in footie pajamas and have since demanded that the other films live up to the expectations of their childhoods. The series’ producers gambled on a writer-director-craftsman, Rian Johnson, who had the nerve to break the rules, and the result was the first “Star Wars” movie with a real visual beauty and a subversive sense of play (not to mention fair play). Rey (Daisy Ridley), the new trilogy’s savior Jedi, turned out to be related to nobody — which meant that anybody could be a hero. Acts, not destiny, were what counted here. J.J. Abrams, who directed the first in the new trilogy, “The Force Awakens” (2015), returns for the finale, and he brings this precious pop-culture property back into the barn. He’s the series’ producer as well, and, fittingly, “The Rise of Skywalker” feels as if it has been produced rather than directed. The sharp edges of the last movie have been sanded down into a busy but generic scramble. The character of Resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), so offensive to certain fans, has been sidelined. You thought Rey came out of nowhere? Not so fast. The good news is that Abrams is nothing if not professional, and “The Rise of Skywalker” handles multiple strands of characters and complications while keeping the battleship moving forward with due appointed speed. But the promises of Johnson’s movie have been reneged upon. (Some descriptions of plot ensue, so the spoiler-sensitive may choose to avert their eyes.) The first shock — delivered in the opening title crawl — is that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who appeared to be quite dead at the end of “Return of the Jedi” (1983), is very much alive and preparing a vast fleet of warships, each with its own planet-killing cannon, to wipe out the Resistance. He’s headquartered on a super-double-secret planet called Exegol — it only sounds like a dietary supplement — which can be reached if you have one of two rare directional beacons called a Sith Wayfinder, which only sounds like a sport utility vehicle. Somewhat in Palpatine’s corner is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), sporting a nifty new red-veined helmet to make up for killing his father, Han Solo, in “The Force Awakens.” Kylo is still locked in an ongoing mind-meld battle/teenage crush with Rey, who at one point sneaks into his bedroom while he’s out laying waste to civilization. To the disappointment of all, she does not find a diary entitled “My Darth Thoughts.” Rey is still an uneasy figurehead for the ragtag Resistance army under the leadership of General Leia Organa. Remember what I said about nobody dying in ”Star Wars”? That extends to the actors, since the late, lamented Carrie Fisher is present in what feel like editing leftovers from the 2015 film. Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are still splitting the hero duties and have developed a nice banter, even if Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio are too scared to do anything about the torch Finn carries for Rey. They do introduce a fierce lady warrior of color (Naomi Ackie) — like Finn, a renegade stormtrooper — and sort of pair/not pair the two up. Other new characters include Zorii Bliss, a rebel who appears to be Keri Russell under a sleek Deco headpiece, and Richard E. Grant (“Can You Ever Forgive Me?”) as a stiff-backed imperial general. Returning players include Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, standing in once more for the late Peter Mayhew), the digitized Yoda substitute Maz Kanata (voiced by Lupita Nyong’o), Domhnall Gleeson’s weaselly General Hux — honestly, he’s my favorite in the whole trilogy — and others Who Must Not Be Named. It’s useful to remember that while characters may pass away in the “Star Wars” movies, their holograms linger on. Anyway, it’s not worth spoiling the plot of “The Rise of Skywalker” because there really isn’t one, other than the heroes having to figure out how to get to Exegol while Kylo and Rey work out their issues. The former has a crew of masked fighters called the Knights of Ren — it only sounds like a lost post-punk band — but neither they nor the hissing Emperor seem able to resolve his adolescent identity crisis. Driver is acceptable in a role he seems to have outgrown; what he’s doing in the current “Marriage Story” seems much more, well, universal. By contrast, the new trilogy is lucky to have Ridley, who handles Rey’s physical action with agility while simmering with the character’s inner conflicts; the digitized Götterdämmerung of the film’s final half hour acquires what impact it has through Rey’s dramatic journey. “The Rise of Skywalker” puts her and all the other heroes through a gauntlet of interplanetary threats, including a bout of quicksand that recalls some of the Saturday-matinee perils of the very first “Star Wars.” The new movie, in its bid to do everything yet still leave the characters vulnerable, also gives Rey miraculous healing powers and the ability to swoop through the air — except when the plot calls for her to tortuously climb the side of a fallen Death Star with her bare hands. There are other “oh, come on” moments in the new film, like a knife blade that delivers a crucial clue by lining up perfectly with a distant horizon — but only if the heroes happen to be standing in just the right spot, which they are. More dispiriting is the sense that Abrams is bringing in this story for the least controversial, most audience-placating landing he and his Disney sovereigns can manage. Yet for all the caution, the only two moments in the entire 2½ hours of “The Rise of Skywalker” that genuinely moved me involve a grieving Bigfoot and a tin man’s farewell. Abrams has done what was required of him, and you feel shaken and rattled but never truly thrilled — never lifted up into the fizzy pop-movie stratosphere of the original “Star Wars.” With “The Last Jedi,” Rian Johnson took us there with daring and wit. In “The Rise of Skywalker,” the empire strikes back. Directed by J.J. Abrams. Written by Abrams and Chris Terrio, based on a story by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow.

"Dec 18, 2019"," If the central tenet of Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi was to kill the past to make way for the future, The Rise of Skywalker is all about bringing the dead back to life. After the divisive middle entry to this new Disney-helmed trilogy, The Force Awakens director J.J. Abrams was tasked with the Herculean feat of pleasing both the fans and detractors of The Last Jedi and with The Rise of Skywalker decides to just lean into resurrecting and regurgitating the past as much as possible, much like he did his first time out. The most obvious example of this comes in the form of our old pal Sheev, the Senator-turned-Supreme-Chancellor-turned-Emperor, whose appearance was teased to fans from the very first trailer, and his handling is a microcosm of the film’s issues writ large.  I bring up this example not to spoil the film (this happens in the very first moments of The Rise of Skywalker mind you) but to introduce the pretty flimsy logical framework which becomes more and more evident as the story proceeds. Here, more than ever, there seems a total disinterest in asking “how?” Star Wars has long thrived in the mystic and the mysterious, the whole idea of the Force at its best as an intangible abstraction that ebbs and flows through the fabric of the story. In fact, at critical points in the saga, the storytelling lost its luster when it sought to over-define the cogs behind the magic of the Force. The Phantom Menace’s attempt to qualify it as a measurable quality (vis-à-vis the much-maligned midichlorians) is held as a long-disdained ding against Lucas’ prequel entries. But there’s a major difference between allowing mystic qualities to embolden the series’ inherent mysticism and failing to properly address questions of logic and character development.  The Rise of Skywalker is victim to bungled character arcs and miffed logic partially because the new trilogy simply doesn’t operate as such. Cohesion is hard to come by because there is no apparent guiding narrative and subtextual principals that align beneath the Disney trilogy. Rather, this feels like three films loosely tied together battling to convey different theses. The passing of the baton from J.J. to Johnson was problematic, if not broken, and almost impossible to resolve coming into a final chapter. Just as The Last Jedi shook off its predecessor by tossing the metaphoric baton (in the form of Luke’s lightsaber) over its shoulder, The Rise of Skywalker picks up said baton and beats Johnson about the head with it. There is not harmony between these three films as a result and major story elements suffer in turn.  The ninth chapter and final entry to the Skywalker saga is an overstuffed, exposition-heavy, wild-goose chase across the galaxy that sees Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) race around the galaxy to acquire various doodads and MacGuffins sure to lead them to the ghost-faced Palpatine, who plans to rule the galaxy once more, for whatever reason. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is there to throw a wrench in their plans and somehow is both the new Supreme Leader of The First Order and yet always seems to be off on his own chasing down Rey, trying to turn her to the dark side for reasons that are as murky as a glass of Bantha milk. The combative relationship/sibling-like-rivalry between Rey and Ren has until now been the most developed of the new trilogy but The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t really deliver in further complicating their bond or earnestly untangling it. Instead, they smash lightsabers a lot until the movie realizes that it needs to tie itself up into a tidy bow and things fall into place with a bit of a relegated whimper. The conclusion for many of these characters is neat and clumsy, none more so than Driver’s character, Abrams and Terrio rushing towards a predetermined conclusion without stopping to do the character work required to make said conclusion feel earned. The broad strokes are there but the minute connective tissue is paid almost no mind at all.  In the wake of Palpatine’s return, the First Order too is relegated to a convoluted and relatively minor threat, another decision that undoes what the first two films in this trilogy were seemingly building towards. Endeared to a sense of exponential and endless escalation, the latest Star Wars suffers a now-familiar miscalculation in assuming that bigger is necessarily better and Rise of Skywalker doesn’t hide its aspirations to be the biggest of the saga’s nine chapters, even if that means dismantling the narrative scaffolding that has existed up to this point. This results in some tremendous and breathtaking visual effects – a legion of Star Destroyers lining the skies for example – underscored by a darker palette that skews towards the older members of the audience who long begged for some tangible grit in their Star Wars. Abrams’ skill as a visual storyteller is never far from mind, his prowess as a technician persistently outshining his skill as a storyteller. But even the production design and wowing special effects play into the overwhelming criticisms of J.J.’s new movies: that they are little more than reflections of the original trilogy blown up to bigger proportions, often devoid of new storylines and unique themes. Lucas famously opined that his prequel trilogy was meant to rhyme with the OT but Abrams has taken that mantra and driven it into the ground, opting to beg, borrow and steal rather than repurpose and reflect. There are flashes of originality to be had in Rise of Skywalker (and I unabashedly love the pure aesthetic look and texture of this entry) but they are too often few and far between and stuck between clunky exposition, far too much of the film devoted to plot contrivances, rescues, double-crosses, and reveals. With so much going on plot-wise, main characters/heroes Finn and Poe are again stuck in the same stalled-out gear, their “arc” (if you can even call it that) sadly resembling a flatline. Finn had one of the most intriguing introductions to the series imaginable but Rise of Skywalker doesn’t even try to grapple with the fallout of a deserter Stormtrooper and leaves the character with much unsaid. Place some blame on the fact that Skywalker has to make time for a deafening number of pitstops with nostalgia, a certifiable army of fan favorites clustering into the frame as if on a victory lap after a Super Bowl win, with pretty much any and every Star Wars character of note passing through the narrative for a fist bump or high five at one point or another.  Perhaps this is part of the main takeaway from a trilogy that has been all about taking two steps forward and one step back, one that has split fans down the middle, and left few wholly satisfied: that through the ups and downs, there remains for some an undeniable affinity for these characters and their galaxy far, far away. That the Star Wars property even at its least inspired is still Star Wars. And despite the myriad issues I claim with this new trilogy, I cannot deny its raw wide-eyed entertainment value and my inherent inexplicable draw to its telling. Nothing in the world of movies quite looks, feels, or sounds like Star Wars and even though Rise of Skywalker may ultimately be more impersonator than originator, I still found myself gawking and gasping, often in spite of the critical warning bells going off in my brain trying to checkmate the diehard fan still alive in me. And like Luke telling Vader that he still senses good in him, I find myself at a crossroads, examining my own relationship to fandom, weighing out the laundry list of critical shortcomings against the loads of activated pleasure centers that Skywalker endeavors to light up. It’s a disharmonious process and not one I’ll soon have a concrete answer to but, at the end of the day, I still sense a fan in me.  CONCLUSION: The Star Wars series as we know it comes to a close in a clunky and almost-kinda-maybe satisfying fashion, but not without its shortcomings. The force may not be strongest with Abrams attempt to wrap up the Skywalker saga, amd some of the characters certainly get the short end of the stick because of it, but fans will still probably find themselves seduced even by its dark side, so long as they don’t search their feelings too much.

"Dec 18, 2019"," It’s interesting that in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker there are multiple plot threads about spaceships rising or wondering how they would land. Do you think Lucasfilm realized this would become a metaphor for the film when scripting? Because if not, that’s some great kismet as this new Star Wars movie struggles to take off into anything resembling a good movie and just barely sticks a landing for a saga 40 years old. The tale begins with our heroes attempting to find whatever means they can to defeat the First Order. Rey is continuing her Jedi training under the tutelage of General Leia, though she doesn’t seem to be gaining the skills she wants. Finn and Poe have been moving about the galaxy andd get a message from a spy in the First Order. This brings everyone back together again and they try and find the clues to what could help them win their last stand. Meanwhile, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren has been hearing the call of a mysterious voice and after making it to Exegor finds that Emperor Palpatine is not dead and intends to raise the Sith back to world dominating prominence. The above description is but a teeny tiny segment of the plot of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and the plot becomes the detriment of the movie. There are moments that are visually stunning and Oscar Isaac’s performance alone would be reason to see this film, but the plot keeps the movie from rising to any heights. There are so many threads this movie is attempting to weave, all while trying to act like barely anything in The Last Jedi happened. JJ Abrams has in effect made a sequel to The Force Awakens and that it would be wise to have all the characters band together and do all the things he would have done in two movies into one. Also what good is having the characters banding together if they don’t have much to do? All this chatter in the media about how excited everyone was to be back and working together doesn’t amount to much for characters not named Rey, Poe, and Kylo. John Boyega might have more screen time this go round but if he just exists to be talking about Rey and shouting her name than does it really matter that you gave him more screen time? And poor Kelly Marie Tran, whose Rose Tico got sidelined like hell in this film. Imagine enduring all that she endured for just being in The Last Jedi, getting a new script, and seeing the part she had to play. She should fight everyone. Furthermore, what Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker really sidelines is the originality that would have made this a fitting conclusion in favor of servicing a particular type of fan. If you disliked The Last Jedi, are a shipper, or a “dude bro”, this movie will probably rank high based on reasons I’ll get into in a spoiler section on Sunday. If you’re like me, then Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will just feel like two hours and twenty minutes of invested time that sadly weren’t enjoyable. First let’s get into the complete and utter foolery that is Rey’s ancestry. Disney had a winner with the presumed storyline of Rey’s parents being no one. It served as an inspiring note, along with the little boy at the end of The Last Jedi that anyone has the potential to be force sensitive. In tying her lineage to Palpatine, the movie undoes any good will and seems to have kowtowed to fan pressure to have her parents be something. We have already seen one person overcome their bloodline in previous films and in this they doubled down with Kylo also turning back to the light, so ultimately Rey’s story does have the same kind of verve that it should. Speaking of Kylo, redemption arcs for white male characters who ruthlessly murder are played out and his redemption arc to me has always been unnecessary. These movies have all these political undertones and notions about good versus evil yet seem to give evil people with momentary shots of good full repentance. Having Kylo die is a good thing, having him kiss Rey only to die is fan service to the nth degree and utter horseshit. Poe’s storyline to me was the best in the film and I want a saga on Keri Russell’s character, but having their relationship be what it was felt like an overcourse correction on any reading that Poe might be queer. Like it’s perfectly fine and even really funny, but probably unnecessary. This movie is so aggresively heterosexual that even the two random lesbians kissing at the end felt more like Disney wanting to pat themselves on the back for deigning to acknowledge LGBTQ characters at all than any kind of interesting moment.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Whether you were  around in 1977 when creator George Lucas first unleashed his cultural behemoth in theaters, or you just started binge-watching the whole thing yesterday on your phone, Star Wars is undeniable — just as skipping the ninth (and, so they claim, the last) is unthinkable. All that’s left is the rush to judgment on whether director and co-writer J.J. Abrams made sure Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is everything you want and need it to be. Short answer: Of course it isn’t. The impossible job of being all things to all Star-gazers leaves Abrams, who kicked off the third trilogy with The Force Awakens in 2015, straining to cram in everything. The result is often chaos, but it’s also a euphoric blast of pulse-quickening adventure, laced with humor and heart. Sure, you’ll nitpick the thing to death with your friends. But that’s the point. When it comes to Stars Wars fandom, the infighting is as crucial as the love. Of course you have questions about the plot: Who lives, who dies, who tells their story? Will Rey (Daisy Ridley) join Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) on the Dark Side? Is Reylo a thing? Will there be an epic kiss? Who are Rey’s parents? How does Carrie Fisher, who died in 2016, manage to turn up one last time as Princess Leia? Will the ghosts of Han (Harrison Ford) and Luke (Mark Hamill) — now one with the Force — make appearances? And will Episode IX really be the end? The answers: It doesn’t feel like the end to me. And if I say anything more, the spoiler police will pounce. Know this: There is no Baby Yoda (we have The Mandalorian for that). Rise of Skywalker comes in hot on a battle between Rey and Kylo. They use lightsabers (now and forever the coolest). Kylo, still fetishizing the headgear of his granddaddy Darth Vader, is pissed that Rey sides with the Resistance, and won’t take his hand (he uses that ardent phrase) and join him as Supreme Leader of the villainous First Order. “I killed Snoke,” snarls Kylo, “and I’ll kill you.” He doesn’t mean it. Or does he? He’s still taking orders from the hooded, ghastly-pale Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who is determined to get Rey in his clutches before she can complete her Jedi training and Kylo can get too close to her. Driver is terrific at bringing danger and depth to the conflicted Kylo, born Ben Solo to his parents Han and Leia. His haunted presence makes the movie. Bloodlines are a huge deal in the Star Wars canon. Rey still doesn’t know her parents (she’ll soon find out), but she’s loyal to Leia, now a general. Thanks to unused footage from 2017’s The Last Jedi‚ director Rian Johnson’s much-debated middle chapter in this final trilogy, Fisher is back in action, and the warmth of her presence raises the bar (and not a few tears). It’s deeply moving to watch Leia pass the mantle of power to Rey, whose rise the film documents. And Ridley comes into her own here as a soul-searching Jedi fighter who learns that nothing in the Jedi handbook can beat following her own gut. The plot that Abrams cooks up with co-screenwriter Chris Terrio hinges on the fact that Rey and her Resistance team need to get their hands on a crystal that will show them the way to Exogol, the hidden land of the Siths, where Palpatine intends to establish himself as the leader of the Final Order. Got that? Doesn’t matter. It’s just an excuse to get the old gang together: Chewie, R2-D2, C-3PO, and BB-8. John Boyega doesn’t have much to do as Finn, the ex-stormtrooper who turned against the Dark Side. Oscar Isaac zips and quips dashingly as the pilot Poe Dameron, but his character is too closely modeled on Han Solo, and Poe’s flirtation with the armored and masked Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) seems extraneous. Things pick up when Billy Dee Williams, now 83, returns as Lando Calrissian, the smack-talking general we haven’t seen since 1983’s Return of the Jedi. Comparisons to the past history of Star Wars (let’s not dwell on the excruciatingly dull prequel trilogy that Lucas foisted on us starting in 1999) don’t really serve its final chapter. But there is a provocative theme at play: the attempt of the Emperor to make the Jedi feel alone in the galaxy and incapable of resistance (even a Wookie would get that Trump reference). There is also no disputing the fanboy reverence Abrams feels for what came before — the X-wing dogfights, the lightsaber duels, the camaraderie. Lucas recently expressed his disappointment that The Force Awakens was basically a remake of 1977’s Star Wars: A New Hope. And others will never forgive Johnson for turning Luke into a mad nihilist out of Apocalypse Now in The Last Jedi. But there we go squabbling again. Flaws and all, The Rise of Skywalker is part of our film history and, when Rey and Kylo seize the screen, an indelible part of our hearts.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," If nothing else, fans who loudly decried Rian Johnson's ""The Last Jedi"" (2017) — mostly for the crime of daring to be different — are likely to fall in love with J.J. Abrams' ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker."" With its retconning, return of familiar faces and marginalizing of others, plus recycled story beats, it's the best ""told you so"" argument a certain subset of fans could have hoped for. Yes, ""Skywalker"" is pure fan service, which probably is what the franchise needs after the divisive ""Last Jedi"" and the collective shrug that greeted ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" (2018). And despite plotting that's overstuffed and predictable, and the disappointment of seeing such defensive backtracking in the story, it's also an entertaining conclusion to the nine-film saga George Lucas began 42 years ago. Though I could spend the rest of this review simply listing the many, many characters, this sequel trilogy really is about two — Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), née Ben Solo, now the supreme leader of the sinister First Order. Like Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader before them, they represent light and dark — the opposing forces within each of us — and must choose which side to embrace. Each tempts the other, and the connection between them is curiously strong. After killing his father, Han Solo, in ""The Force Awakens,"" and his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, in ""The Last Jedi,"" Kylo Ren aims to be his own man. But there's another he must answer to. Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), last seen inside the exploding Death Star in ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), is alive and well enough to direct the secret construction of a colossal fleet of planet-annihilating Star Destroyers in the far reaches of the galaxy. ""Kill the girl,"" he orders Ren. Driver's portrayal of a man perpetually trying to convince himself he is a villain has been the strongest performance across the trilogy, and he's at his best here, adding more nuance and layers than the script provides. Ridley is nearly his equal, and we practically can feel the heat of the emotions burning between Rey and Ren. Rey and her friends — including Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) — race through space searching for a doohickey that will lead them to the Sith world where Palpatine is hiding. (Their hunt takes them to another desert, because of course it does. If we've learned anything from these three trilogies, it's that there always must be a desert in ""Star Wars."") Kylo and the mysterious Knights of Ren — and the always ineffective stormtroopers; you'd think at some point, between the Empire and the First Order, someone would have done some kind of performance review of these clowns — are never far behind. This is merely the set-up. Abrams, returning from ""The Force Awakens,"" and co-writer Chris Terrio breathlessly jump from spaceship to spaceship and planet to planet as they try to service the heroes and villains of the new movies and holdovers from the past, including Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). Fisher, who died in 2016, appears here via unused, repurposed footage from ""The Force Awakens,"" resulting in an awkward, stiff performance for an actress who was such a spark plug in life. It's no one's fault — the filmmakers could work only with what they had — but the nature of it draws attention just as much as if they had created a new, digital performance. For all its faults, though, ""Skywalker"" is very much in the spirit of classic ""Star Wars,"" emphasizing hope and standing up to forces of oppression. I can pick it apart now and point out things that don't add up — surely, someone would have noticed the massive amount of materials it would have taken to build Palpatine's new fleet as they were transported across the galaxy to his hideout — yet at times it stirred within me some of the joy and excitement I felt watching — and watching and watching — the original movies as a child. Regardless of your like or dislike for them, these new movies have shown it's time for ""Star Wars"" to move on and tell new stories.

"Dec 18, 2019","  The end of a nine-film, three-arc saga that’s been around for more than 40 years, for some people, Star Wars – and specifically the Skywalker story – has been with them their whole lives. So it’s perhaps not surprising there’s a lot of emotion riding on JJ Abrams’ The Rise Of Skywalker. Even more so, perhaps, after some of the discourse surrounding The Last Jedi. “This is not going to go the way you think,” Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) infamously growled in The Last Jedi, a thinly veiled mission statement of sorts for Johnson’s riskier approach, which sent the series in a bold new direction. By contrast, The Rise Of Skywalker plays out more or less exactly how you’d think, give or take a few surprises. If The Force Awakens was Abrams’ take on original trilogy opener A New Hope, this new trilogy capper is his Return Of The Jedi reprise – and not just because it features a returning big bad. To try and sum up the plot is to wade too far into spoiler territory, given the fact that the ins and outs of the story have been kept tightly under wraps – and rightly so, packed as it is with fan-pleasing moments. The set-up, though, is laid out in a three-pronged opening that quickly reintroduces our heroes and villains: Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her Jedi training under Leia’s (Carrie Fisher) tutelage; Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are on a dangerous mission to steal secrets about the First Order’s next moves; and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is seeking out a new (old) phantom menace that could snuff out the Resistance for good. It’s that opening act that proves to be the film’s biggest weakness, with Abrams and his writing partner Chris Terrio (Argo, Batman V Superman) chucking so many new ideas and developments at you in such a short space of time that it essentially serves as a sort-of exposition-laden asteroid field. The frenetic editing between the three story strands and the swirling camerawork don’t help, either – it’s a pacey start, sure, but it doesn’t leave much time to take it all in. Luckily, the film settles into its groove once our heroes are reunited and sent off on a quest to find an ancient artefact that will set them on another collision course with Ren and the First Order. Even if many of the film’s new characters (including Naomi Ackie’s Jannah, Keri Russell’s Zorri Bliss and new mini-droid D-0) fail to make much of a mark, it’s great to spend more time with Rey, Finn and Poe as a trio, while Ridley and Driver truly spark whenever they’re on screen together. Most notably, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) has a greatly expanded role here, providing much of the film’s humour and, ironically for a robotic sidekick, some of its more tender moments. Elsewhere, original trilogy hero Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) gets a pleasingly triumphant homecoming, while Leia’s story – made up of existing footage and stand-ins after Fisher’s tragic passing in 2016 – is handled sensitively. As with the previous two films, The Rise Of Skywalker looks absolutely stunning, seamlessly merging cutting-edge CG with grounded, practical visual effects (keep an eye out for a veritable menagerie of scene-stealing puppeteered alien critters). And Abrams once again proves himself skilled in the art of set-pieces, too – from a storm-lashed lightsaber duel atop the wreckage of the second Death Star, to a thrilling “ground assault” on the wing of a Star Destroyer, the film is stuffed full of exhilarating action and even a couple of punch-the-air moments, too. Trying to neatly tie up 40 years worth of storytelling while aiming to please everyone is an impossible task, it seems – and one that Abrams tackles admirably, if not wholly successfully. If you’re a Last Jedi fan, you might feel short-changed at how some of that film’s risk-taking has been scaled back, especially in the overly familiar third act. If you’re not, you might appreciate some of the more traditional elements but, even so, there are still several developments that will likely provoke just as much fierce debate (make no mistake, there’s a lot to unpick here if you want to). As a huge, sci-fi blockbuster, then, The Rise Of Skywalker is a mostly satisfying spectacle – it’s fun, entertaining, visually dazzling and, yes, emotional in parts, too. But as the grand finale of the Skywalker Saga, it falls somewhat short of the mark.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 18, 2019"," There are a few hopeful echoes of the jaunty tone of the original Star Wars movies in this, the ninth and final film in the Luke Skywalker saga. The director, J.J.Abrams, has some old-fashioned fun with the galaxy's many tribes and with those durable favourites, Chewbacca and the droids. During breaks in the fighting, we're treated to a wide-ranging tour of some suitably exotic planets. And Oscar Isaac, too, does well as the fighter pilot Poe Dameron, who's taken over the Han Solo brand of swashbuckling brashness. But Abrams doesn't leave a lot of time for jokes and he's even less interested in romance. Despite a lot of leaden dialogue, labouring under the information it has to carry, the action rockets along, powered both by its need to be more spectacular than ever before and the script's obligation to tie up the saga's many loose ends. It's a film driven by a weighty sense of its own history. It's also full of ghosts. That of Carrie Fisher is only the most poignant. Abrams has claimed that he didn't have to resort to digital sleight of hand to resolve Princess Leia's part in the storyline. There was enough unused footage from the seventh film in the series, The Force Awakens, to fill out her role and supply the emotional charge he needed. And he's right about the sentiment, largely because the eerie sense of reality in Fisher's posthumous appearance is enhanced by all that nostalgia. Understandably, it's a one-note performance, limited to supplying soothing words of encouragement to the film's young stars but it's inseparable from memories of Leia in her youth with her snail bun hairstyle, her throaty, deadpan delivery and her gift for the quick comeback. The script works diligently at connecting the young and their adventures with seminal events from the past in its efforts to bring the story full circle. Ghostly visions abound, as do disembodied voices offering up advice, portents, warnings and exhortations. Daisy Ridley's Rey, the inheritor of the Jedi warrior tradition, spends a lot of time staring at nothing while waiting for the spiritual equivalent of a wi-fi link to her illustrious predecessors. A much jollier visitor from the old days is Billy Dee Williams' rakish adventurer Lando Calrissian, still incorrigible after all these years. He arrives with a heavy chunk of exposition to get off his chest but once that's done, he enthusiastically sets about joining Chewbacca and the rest in providing a little comic relief. The conflicted relationship between Rey and her nemesis, Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, Leia's sinister son, is one of the most sophisticated twists in the saga's convoluted genealogy and it takes some satisfyingly ingenious turns. Its resolution, however, did leave me wondering. Driver is a great choice for the role. His towering figure and long, melancholy face give him an air of implacable determination. He looks as if he's been harbouring a full catalogue of grudges against the world – or rather, the galaxy – for as long as he can remember. And the wreck of the Death Star II, where his climactic showdown with Rey takes place, is authentically spooky – although the pounding CGI sea which surrounds it is not. I could also argue that a franchise which has outlived one of its stars should have said goodbye long ago but the saga's box-office figures say otherwise. They have already shown that fans have bonded with the new generation of characters and that they're depending on this, the finale, to solve all the remaining mysteries. As to whether it does, the most pedantic devotees are sure to find grounds for complaint. The rest of us will overlook the plot holes because we never set much store in the laws of so-called logic governing the Star Wars universe in the first place. I was just grateful for the fact that this chapter in the saga lets in a little light to take out some of the solemnity that characterised the last two films. All up, it's a rousing, if frenetic and occasionally confused, finish to a series that has kept two generations of moviegoers company throughout their childhood and adolescence.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," “Will this agony ever end,” C-3PO says at one point. Anyone who believes Disney’s marketing ploy that, “this is the final “Star Wars” film,” hasn’t been paying attention. Nothing and no one is ever final in this franchise, which is the largest turn-off for non-fans. As you watch the 11th film in the franchise, it becomes more obvious than ever Oscar Isaac is the new Hans Solo, Daisy Ridley is a less obvious Luke Skywalker, and John Boyega is the new Lando Calrissian.

"Dec 18, 2019"," I’m not sure bringing 40 years of fandom to a final conclusion in one motion picture is possible, so it’s not a surprise that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker buckles a little under the pressure of attempting to do just that. What is a shock is how absurdly plotted, risibly ill-advised and lazily trivial far too much of returning director J.J. Abrams’ and Chris Terrio’s (Argo) obnoxious screenplay ends up being. What they have delivered is fan service of the worst kind, pandering to its audience instead of challenging them, delivering a video-game-like spectacle that’s as emotionally empty as it is dispiritingly lifeless. You have no idea how difficult that was to write. Like many of my generation, the original Star Wars opened my eyes to an expansive cinematic world overflowing with possibility. George Lucas’ 1977 classic led me to films like Rio Bravo, The Hidden Fortress and The Great Escape. It helped me discover authors like Arthur C. Clarke, Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Philip K. Dick. Star Wars made me feel like it was okay that, deep down, I knew I was different than many of my friends, that who I wanted to be and what I wanted out of life might be outside of the expected societal norms. It is likely the most important motion picture I have ever seen as far as my personal life is concerned, and as such it, along with the all of the original trilogy (1980’s The Empire Strikes Back, 1983’s Return of the Jedi), holds a special place in my heart that will never be replaced. Nothing has changed much
over the decades. While I find the prequels (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,
Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith)
to be varying degrees of problematic I still think there is plenty to like
about all three of them. They dared to test the audience and do the unexpected,
and even if not all of Lucas’ ideas had merit each film is still filled with
astonishing moments that made me smile in childlike glee when I first sat down
to watch them.  As for Abrams’ Star Wars: The Force Awakens and writer/director Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, both interstellar adventures took the story of Jedis and The Force into uncharted territory while also introducing new characters worthy of my emotional attachment. They had energy, heart and chutzpah, and even if they sometimes engendered reactions of the worst possible type from angry little (mostly male, mostly Caucasian) nobodies who didn’t feel their (mostly male, mostly Caucasian) needs were being catered to, I was still excited to discover what was going to happen in this supposedly final chapter of the Skywalker saga all the same. For all the scenes that sent my heart soaring, for the few rousing sequences I wanted to stand up and cheer, The Rise of Skywalker squanders all four decades of my affection for the material and does it almost right out of the gate. Picking up some time after the events of The Last Jedi, Abrams and Terrio engage in frenetic plotting that feels more suitable for a Star Wars video game than it does for the ninth chapter in one of the most popular ongoing stories of the past half-century. The first hour is a monstrous mishmash of expository nonsense that demolishes most of what transpired in the previous motion picture and makes many of the more intriguing ideas initially explored in The Force Awakens equally inconsequential. It’s all chaos and fan service and precious little else, the level of nostalgia-pandering Abrams engages in borderline inexcusable. The basic plot concerns the rise of a new evil in a hidden corner of the universe, the long-dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) seemingly restored to life via the collective power of his loyal Sith followers. After taking leadership of the First Order, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) goes in search of the defeated Empire leader, uncertain whether he wants to destroy Palpatine for good or allow the Sith Lord to assist him in his quest to rule the universe. Meanwhile, Resistance fighters Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) have learned both of a spy hidden amongst the highest ranks of the First Order as well as of Palpatine’s resurrection. Even though General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) worries she’s rushing too quickly into danger, current Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) believes they must find the former Emperor and stop whatever plans he might be plotting before they have time to blossom into reality. Rey is also beginning to wonder if her connection to Kylo Ren might be too much for her to overcome, hoping that her connection to The Force might allow some insight as to what the correct course of action is so the Resistance can survive and the First Order defeated once and for all. There’s a lot more, but going into any of it in detail could be construed as a spoiler so I’m going to avoid saying anything more. Not that it matters. Abrams and Terrio don’t seem to care about their story. They seem more excited about hitting Really! Big! Moments! that they’re fairly certain the audience is going to cheer for than they are doing anything substantive or character-driven. All of the new cast members are introduced with zero fanfare and given precious little to stand out from the crowd other than to look interesting and/or do something cool. Returnees like General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) or Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) are blank-faced bystanders and I imagine the only reason they’re still part of the story is because they were left alive at the end of The Last Jedi. But the biggest misstep is that Abrams appears content to play it safe and refuses to challenge the audience in any way whatsoever. His film panders, refuting or trivializing what happened in the past two stories at practically every opportunity. He seems to feel content to bring back the likes of Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian or make a pointlessly big deal out of Rey’s parentage in lieu of trying to bring things to a culmination in a manner that might have been more expressively long-lasting or noteworthy. It’s frankly depressing, and I’m not sure there’s anything more I need to add. As harsh as all this
sounds I will say that Kylo Ren’s story arc is handled reasonably well, Driver’s
astutely multifaceted performance one of the film’s strongest and most mesmeric
attributes. Fisher, who tragically past long before filming started, is brought
back utilizing a collection of deleted scenes from The Force Awakens and
The Last Jedi, the care, respect and love paid to her and her timeless
character uncontestably divine. There are all handful of additional little
moments that die-hard fans of the series won’t be able to stop themselves from
tearing up over (if even only a little bit), and it must be said that while I find
Palpatine’s resurrection obnoxiously silly gosh darn it all if McDiarmid’s
portrayal of this malignantly venomous villain is as magnificent as ever. The actor
knows how to send chills up my spine like virtually no one else, and even if I
wish the character wasn’t here his appearances still manage to be insidiously
effective all the same. Maybe I’ll not feel so sad after I give The Rise of Skywalker a second look. Maybe its more obvious qualities (including what is reported the great John Williams’ final score, which is every bit as marvelous as I ever could have hoped it was going to be) will break me out of my funk and make me see this newest Star Wars in a different light. Until then, the unhappiness I feel right now, in this moment, isn’t going to dissipate anytime soon, and for a series filled with the highest highs (and a small handful of the lowest lows) this is the first time I feel like The Force is no longer with the franchise and the Darkside of corporate cookie-cutter greed has proven to be victorious.

"Dec 18, 2019","If anything, the story is like a two-hour-plus highlight reel, loaded with action-packed space battles, laser sword duels, and the return of the ultimate Star Wars villain, Emperor Palpatine.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," However you felt about The Last Jedi, at least it had something to say. With the much-maligned Star Wars: Episode VIII, director Rian Johnson attempted to make a statement about the insipid allure of nostalgia and an over-reliance on the past. Many fans agree it didn't stick the landing, but the parts that arguably worked--like Kylo and Rey's intimate rivalry, or Luke's shocking cynicism and triumphant redemption--successfully remixed familiar Star Wars tropes into something that felt new-ish. Unfortunately, The Rise of Skywalker director J.J. Abrams doesn't seem to have fully grasped Johnson's message in The Last Jedi--that we have to ""let the past die"" to move forward. Johnson sought to establish a fresh direction for the Star Wars saga, but in Rise, Abrams is interested in killing only the parts of the past that he disagrees with. Instead of continuing down the path that Johnson set, Abrams swerves the franchise into yet another hard u-turn, cramming enough story for two movies into one, and largely acting like the previous film never happened--or actively retconning it. The result is a movie that feels less like the conclusion to a Star Wars trilogy, and more like the casualty of a behind-the-scenes battle between the visions of two diametrically opposed directors. Rise of Skywalker bends over backward to undo what The Last Jedi did, just as that movie subverted all the mysteries set up in The Force Awakens. But much more than its predecessor, Rise of Skywalker exudes petulance--like Abrams is mad someone played with his toys wrong, and his only remaining recourse is to scoop them all up and go home. Rise establishes in its opening crawl that the galaxy has received a mysterious transmission from Emperor Palpatine (something that would have been exciting to actually see onscreen). Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues her training under General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), while Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo) rendezvous with an alleged First Order mole who wants to feed them information. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), meanwhile, searches for the former Emperor, who he considers a threat to his power. From there, the story leaps at lightspeed between set pieces, from an alien version of Coachella to encounters with fantastic creatures that rarely last more than a few moments. As the movie progresses, it makes less and less sense. Rise takes great pains to hastily establish answers and payoffs for mysteries established in The Force Awakens, waving away plot points from The Last Jedi with repeated dumps of confusing dialogue. Events that should be monumental are immediately undercut or undone, without breathing room for the audience to absorb what's taking place. Characters you thought must certainly be dead pop up later inexplicably unharmed, while others simply keel over with little explanation. Uncanny CG puppets of familiar actors' younger selves haunt flashbacks to better times. What should be the movie's most emotional moments are undermined by the weight of exasperating absurdity. Unsurprisingly, Rise of Skywalker is--like both movies that came before it--gorgeous to look at, beautifully scored, and extremely impressive in a technical sense. But to watch this movie for the first time while still harboring any small hope that it might pull the whole conceited mess together in the end is to subject yourself to frustration, disillusionment, and emotional whiplash. There's a reason that hope existed at all: Flawed as it may be, The Force Awakens did a lot right in the world-building and character department. Beneath Episode IX's disregard for coherent storytelling are the bones--like the Death Star's sunken wreckage--of a compelling conclusion to this saga. Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo are great characters; what they lack are actual character arcs. Rey's life as a scavenger lends her some unique skills, for example, but she spends an inordinate amount of time in this movie simply wandering off, face vacant, while her friends are in danger. Or take Finn--these movies have never actually bothered to dig into his past as an indoctrinated Stormtrooper, and, in fact, Rise actively trivializes this backstory at a pivotal moment when it could have explored it further. The group's dynamic is strong when they're together, but fun banter isn't enough to cover for the fact that these characters have rarely spent actual time with one another onscreen or been fleshed out beyond the surface level. Leia's presence is unsettling. Granted, it's no one's fault that the great Carrie Fisher was unable to complete this journey with us. But her scenes in this movie are filled with nonsequiturs, dialogue that was clearly ripped from previous films' unused footage and then re-contextualized with new conversations written around them. Other legacy characters, like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and Chewie, are treated with varying degrees of respect, and their inclusions are often irrelevant and occasionally nonsensical (you'll struggle to figure out why Lando pops up where and when he does, for example). And don't forget about Palpatine himself (once again played by Ian McDiarmid), who has indeed returned, and--well, let's just say you're going to have a lot of questions when it's over. And forget about any of the less central characters; Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who was introduced in TLJ, is present, but has about as many lines as the background character played by an actor from Lost making a cameo. New faces like Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, whose face is never actually seen) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) get a few lines of dialogue each before being casually tossed into the blender and mixed into the background of the rest of the film. New creatures like the infantile puppet Babu Frik and the droid D-O (who turns out to be almost literally a kicked puppy) are charming, but lack depth. Like so much of what gets established in this movie, they're utterly pointless. That adds to the sense that Abrams is trying to cram the plot of two movies into the space of one. In a hypothetical alternate timeline where J.J. kept control of the whole trilogy, he could have left room between this film's abundant reveals and introductions for the characters to interact naturally and for the weight of emotional twists and turns to settle in before yanking the rug out from under audiences yet again. Instead, Rise rushes at breakneck speed to end each scene and get to the next, never stopping to savor any victory or process any loss or defeat. It adds up to a pale cover of Star Wars' greatest hits--dramatic lightsaber duel, ancient artifact scavenger hunt, epic space battle--chewed up and spit out as a series of loosely related vignettes connected by clumsy dialogue and nonsensical plotting. The icing on top is a layer of cloying, saccharine sentimentality that Abrams uses to messily spackle in the story's cracks. At one point the characters choose to rely on a plan that already failed them in The Last Jedi, and not only does no one acknowledge that--but it inexplicably works this time, because this movie's condescendingly optimistic tone demands that it must, continuity and logic be damned. At the same time, Rise gleefully plays fast and loose with rules and laws that earlier movies established decades ago, like Jedi and Sith powers, or the capabilities of ""force ghosts."" Rise even has its own version of the notorious Midi-chlorian--in other words, another new plot device that didn't need to be articulated in the first place getting over-explained to the point of self-parody. In the end, it all feels simply empty. It should never be so clear to audiences that something in the filmmaking process has gone so terribly wrong--that the people who made the first film in a trilogy apparently didn't bother to sketch out a plan for the second and third, and that the movies' directors had visions for the series' future that were so fundamentally at odds. Star Wars deserved better.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 18, 2019"," Klugey doesn’t begin to describe Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, an occasionally charming, relentlessly entertaining and undeniably overstuffed conclusion to George Lucas’ elephantine space opera. Technically, it’s the finale. Fingers crossed.  STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER  ★★★ (3/5 stars)
Directed by: J.J. Abrams
Written by: J.J. Abrams, Chris Terrio
Starring: Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Naomi Ackie
Running time: 142 min. There was a lot of pressure for the ninth and final installment of Star Wars to stick the landing, especially when George Lucas never meant it to happen in the first place. Do you really expect to be satisfied?  Regardless, the Rise of Skywalker is chock-full of thrilling chases and majestic visuals, with the high-end polish of a billion-dollar franchise and all the breezy flair of a B-movie Saturday-matinee serial. “The dead speak!” begins this chapter’s opening text crawl, usually a deadpan recap that here sports an exclamation point with all the awkward flare of a Trumpian tweet. It goes on to say that there’s a mysterious broadcast coming from a phantom emperor. Wait, are they bringing back Emperor Palpatine? You betcha. But how? Maybe one of the main characters will explain. “Somehow Palpatine returned,” says Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Oh, that’s how. Palpatine is hiding on a secret Sith planet that seems to be called Exogol, which sounds a lot like Testicle. And he’s also created an armada of star destroyers that now float above the planet’s surface like it’s an intergalactic parking lot. So now everyone is hot to find Planet Testicle. And the only way to find it is with a pyramidal device called the Wayfinder. Seriously. Meanwhile, bad boy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is on the hunt for former desert urchin Rey (Daisy Ridley). “My knights and I are going hunting for the scavenger,” says Ren with casual intensity. She’s busy levitating with floating rocks and running obstacle courses in a one-student Jedi home school overseen by General Leia (Carrie Fisher). When duty calls, though, she hops on the Millennium Falcon with Poe, Finn (John Boyega), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and 250-year-old Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). “We go together,” says Finn, sounding like a chorine from Grease. But Rey still has her connection to Ren. They’re a diad in the Force, apparently, a sort of spiritual BOGO that’s never really explained well. But it allows them to communicate across space. “I see through the cracks in your mask,” says Rey. Because Ren literally has cracks in his mask. They’re thin and red and don’t blend well with the black matte metal. Monkeys with bat ears sautered Ren’s helmet back together and did a sloppy job. Stupid monkeys. Artificially extending the saga of the Skywalker clan is a tall order even for a slick craftsman like J.J. Abrams, a clever magpie stylist who seems to think that storytelling is just a nesting doll of mystery-box misdirections. Is Chewbacca going to die? Is C-3PO going to get his memory wiped? Sure. Maybe? You’ll see. And then you won’t care. “Give Leia my love,” says Lando Calrissian. What’s he doing here? Not much. Emotional resonance isn’t really Abrams’s strong suit. But he does craft some fun movie moments. And, lacking the chops for actual human connection, he opts for lots of hugs. Seriously, people are constantly hugging each other. And keep hugging. The hugging in this movie could prompt a drinking contest. Palpatine has been pulling the strings from the beginning, Rey realizes, which makes sense because Rey heard his voice in J.J. Abrams’s The Force Awakens. If anything, The Rise of Skywalker seems to be a course-correction after Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi and feels more like a direct sequel to the 2015 film than to the 2017 one. It ties up a lot of the loose ends that The Force Awakens introduced, and makes this latest trilogy actually feel more cohesive. Sorry, Rian. Abrams knows not to bite the hand that feeds. And Disney wants to feed people Star Wars moments. So Ren chokes an imperial officer in a conference room. One of the bad guys talks to Palpatine via hologram. Rey has a lightsaber duel with Ren in the throne room of the second Death Star. Rey also uses the Jedi mind trick on a couple of dummy stormtroopers. And our new heroes sneak onto an enemy starship to rescue a prisoner, then make a breathtaking getaway on the Millennium Falcon. One of them even makes a surprise visit to Luke’s old farmstead on Tatooine, basking in its twin sunset. Because of course. Why not. The original Star Wars was a giddy, goofy, wonderful fluke. And its successor, The Empire Strikes Back, came out in a time when sequels could aspire to The Godfather Part II instead of just Jaws 2. Now every Star Wars film must be recycled thrills with new tweaks. Lightspeed skipping! A lady lightsaber! Planet-destroying Death-Star laser cannons! At least there are no Ewoks. Oh, wait. Ewoks.

Rey (Daisy Ridley) is experiencing visions of her parents while being telepathically challenged by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), determined to have her join him on the dark side while he himself is haunted by the voices of the dark forces which preceded him in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” Cowriter (with ""Argo's"" Chris Terrio)/director J.J. Abrams (""Super 8,"" ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"") injected new life into the saga four years ago by introducing a new set of characters in an organic production that was, essentially, a remake of Episode IV. Rian Johnson upped the ante in “The Last Jedi” by expanding the franchise lore in unexpected ways. So it is a great disappointment that Abrams returns to wrap things up with a slapdash rehash that plows a well worn path, only one setting offering anything new to really marvel at. One wishes Johnson had kept his “Knives Out” on ice and given us a finale with more to sink our teeth into.
Once again, the rebels led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher in poorly integrated archival footage) must defeat forces of evil now seemingly led by a rejuvenated Palpatine using Ren as his proxy. I’m not even going to bother getting into myriad plot details, all of which circle around to the same old anyway, right down to Ewoks. Suffice to say unnecessary exposition delivered with the pummeling speed of a tennis ball machine, colliding logic, lack of consequence for momentous setbacks and a sense of inevitability, of having seen this all done before and better, make J.J. Abrams' capper to the original saga a disappointment. I haven't checked my watch this much throughout this holiday movie season.
There is some amount of intrigue in finally learning Rey’s ancestry and Driver adds real emotion to their back-and-forth romance cum rivalry (his introduction, the lone survivor on a snowy, forest battlefield, recalls Coppola’s “Dracula”). The film’s highlight takes place on the wreck of the Death Star amidst churning seas, veteran “Star Wars” composer John Williams setting the stage with an eerie recall to Vader’s theme as Rey finds what she’s looking for only to engage in a lightsaber duel with Ren. Keri Russell’s new character Zorii Bliss, an ex of Poe Dameron’s (Oscar Isaac), is a cheeky and welcome new addition, but Jannah (Naomi Ackie, 2016's ""Lady Macbeth""), like Finn (John Boyega) a former Stormtrooper, isn’t given enough to do after delivering an intriguing back story. Leia’s resurrection via old footage manipulated into new is as artificial as a franchise hologram, sightlines and perspectives often off, her expression never changing, but fear not as other members of the old gang all make appearances, most notably Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian. Old droids (Anthony Daniels’ C3PO and Jimmy Vee’s R2-D2) and new (Brian Herring’s BB-8) are joined by D-O, dubbed ‘Conehead’ by Dameron.
The film’s climactic battle and its aftermath are nothing new, a quick same sex kiss little more than PC talking point, but a return to an iconic landscape is, admittedly, touching. Still, with “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” Abrams always errs by reassuring far too quickly that everything will be OK. Cowriter (with ""Argo's"" Chris Terrio)/director J.J. Abrams (""Super 8,"" ""Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens"") injected new life into the saga four years ago by introducing a new set of characters in an organic production that was, essentially, a remake of Episode IV. Rian Johnson upped the ante in “The Last Jedi” by expanding the franchise lore in unexpected ways. So it is a great disappointment that Abrams returns to wrap things up with a slapdash rehash that plows a well worn path, only one setting offering anything new to really marvel at. One wishes Johnson had kept his “Knives Out” on ice and given us a finale with more to sink our teeth into. Once again, the rebels led by General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher in poorly integrated archival footage) must defeat forces of evil now seemingly led by a rejuvenated Palpatine using Ren as his proxy. I’m not even going to bother getting into myriad plot details, all of which circle around to the same old anyway, right down to Ewoks. Suffice to say unnecessary exposition delivered with the pummeling speed of a tennis ball machine, colliding logic, lack of consequence for momentous setbacks and a sense of inevitability, of having seen this all done before and better, make J.J. Abrams' capper to the original saga a disappointment. I haven't checked my watch this much throughout this holiday movie season. There is some amount of intrigue in finally learning Rey’s ancestry and Driver adds real emotion to their back-and-forth romance cum rivalry (his introduction, the lone survivor on a snowy, forest battlefield, recalls Coppola’s “Dracula”). The film’s highlight takes place on the wreck of the Death Star amidst churning seas, veteran “Star Wars” composer John Williams setting the stage with an eerie recall to Vader’s theme as Rey finds what she’s looking for only to engage in a lightsaber duel with Ren. Keri Russell’s new character Zorii Bliss, an ex of Poe Dameron’s (Oscar Isaac), is a cheeky and welcome new addition, but Jannah (Naomi Ackie, 2016's ""Lady Macbeth""), like Finn (John Boyega) a former Stormtrooper, isn’t given enough to do after delivering an intriguing back story. Leia’s resurrection via old footage manipulated into new is as artificial as a franchise hologram, sightlines and perspectives often off, her expression never changing, but fear not as other members of the old gang all make appearances, most notably Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian. Old droids (Anthony Daniels’ C3PO and Jimmy Vee’s R2-D2) and new (Brian Herring’s BB-8) are joined by D-O, dubbed ‘Conehead’ by Dameron.

"Dec 18, 2019"," There’s no way to end the Skywalker Saga and make all the fans happy – and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker certainly isn’t going to make all the fans happy. Those who loved The Last Jedi will surely be peeved by the jettisoning of what that divisive eighth installment introduced, while those irked by The Force Awakens’ nostalgia-bait will likely be irritated by Episode IX’s recycling of familiar beats and plentiful fan service. The Rise of Skywalker labors incredibly hard to check all the boxes and fulfill its narrative obligations to the preceding entries, so much so that you can practically hear the gears of the creative machinery groaning under the strain like the Millennium Falcon trying to make the jump to hyperspace. It ultimately makes the film a clunky and convoluted conclusion to this beloved saga, entertaining and endearing as it may be. The movie has lots of heart and energy and some very beautiful imagery of vivid new worlds throughout, particularly that watery lightsaber duel between Rey and Kylo Ren glimpsed in trailers. But The Rise of Skywalker’s overall execution is as erratic as it is enthusiastic, with a story full of plot holes large enough to fly a Star Destroyer through. It lacks nerve, relying instead on nostalgic fan service to try to make the ride as comfortable as possible for the masses, falling back on the most blatant but successful tool of all -- Big Emotions -- to score its most crowd-pleasing points. There are emotional payoffs to this trilogy’s most debated subplots, some more effective than others. Big questions are answered and other matters are definitively settled. There are bittersweet callbacks to the prior films designed to bring a tear to many a fan’s eye, rousing battles on land and in the sky that get the adrenaline pumping, and enough humor to generate more than a few guffaws. Yet the movie also uses its epic scale and breathless speed in the hopes that you’ll just move along, move along, without dwelling on the details of its convoluted storytelling and awkward ret-conning. The first half is exposition-heavy and laden with multiple MacGuffins – a prolonged clue hunt before the film finds surer footing. The story only gains traction once it settles into the main physical and spiritual battle between Rey (Daisy Ridley in her most confident appearance in the trilogy) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, giving a very effective less-is-more performance). They are the only characters who truly matter here outside of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher in her final screen appearance, but more on that later) and the returning Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, still chewing scenery after all these years). Several new characters are cool-looking but ultimately don’t really have much impact on the events of the film, but that leaves room for legacy players C-3P0 (a poignant Anthony Daniels), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and Lando Calrissian (a slower but still smooth Billy Dee Williams) to ably serve their plot functions with heart and humor. While John Boyega’s Finn and Oscar Isaac’s Poe act as the film’s heroic men of action (Poe, in particular, gets his most screen time and Isaac his best moments to shine yet in the trilogy), the pair basically replay the same ideas in every scene, just in different locations. That’s not the fault of the actors, but the story, which strains to establish Rey, Finn, and Poe as a close-knit trio on par with Luke, Han, and Leia when the reality is the characters have spent more time apart before this than together. Thus, much of the development of their relationship has happened off-screen between the end of The Last Jedi and the beginning of this film, so the stakes between them here aren’t especially well-earned. For all its many flaws, and somewhat by necessity, at least George Lucas’ prequel trilogy had a clear idea of what it wanted to be and where it was going (and I’m conceding that as someone who didn’t much like them). This new trilogy just seemed to make things up as it went along – and while that was certainly true of the original trilogy to some extent, there’s a reason it’s generally considered wise to have an endgame in mind. To that end, The Rise of Skywalker chooses to marginalize and sideline characters and themes The Last Jedi established in order to pivot to its new destination, choices that will surely be viewed as a vital course correction by some and fearful pandering by others. The Rise of Skywalker runs the gamut, with sequences ranging from scary to saccharine, from very cool to very corny. It’s just a whole lot of movie packed into a two-hour and 22-minute runtime (10 minutes shorter than The Last Jedi) but more doesn’t always mean better. The final act comes perilously close to playing like the finale of a lesser superhero movie or YA fantasy adaptation due to its reliance on overwhelming visual effects that do their best to drown out the more ham-fisted moments. The creative choices made in Act Three – the most clumsily executed section of the film – will undoubtedly prove divisive and the subject of hot debate for years to come. Nostalgia and poignancy ultimately help the film cross the finish line but not without a lot of rough spots along the way. Finally, while there had been much speculation about how The Rise of Skywalker would handle the inclusion of Leia given Fisher’s death in 2016, the movie manages to make the best of a bad situation. Keen observers will likely deduce where Fisher’s rejiggered takes originated from but – as with Brandon Lee in The Crow and Oliver Reed in Gladiator, two actors who died during filming those respective movies – Fisher’s scenes work as well as was likely possible under the tragic circumstances. Leia’s arc requires a suspension of disbelief since it's well known to fans that Fisher didn't film any new footage for this final film, but for general audiences unaware of the solution Abrams came up with here, Leia's subplot should prove more effective than distracting. There is a lot to process walking out of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, a film engineered to hit the viewer on multiple levels while struggling to settle 42 years’ worth of story elements – probably too much for any one film to handle. For as much love, passion, and nostalgia is evident in this movie, it’s also a film very palpably made from a place driven by fear of disappointing the audience, and that anxiety fuels a lot of the story’s curious creative choices and unwieldy execution. The film’s heartstring-tugging moments, technical impressiveness, and relentless action will likely be enough for those fans who just want to keep the visor down on their blast shield helmets and let the Force flow through them. But for those who need some consistency and logic to the story in this elaborately detailed fictional galaxy, there will likely be the bittersweet pang of accepting that this long-running saga couldn’t quite stick the landing. But even at its most divisive and imperfect, the Star Wars franchise has offered much to embrace and celebrate. This finale to the Skywalker Saga is, if nothing else, a tribute to that legacy.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," The big question upon leaving the cinema after watching Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is what, exactly, did you just watch? Was it a stirring end to one of the big-screen’s greatest cinematic adventures? Sure, I guess, if you squint. Or was it, looking back, a YouTube fan film, only one where the fan is JJ Abrams and the budget is provided by Disney? Also: yes, a bit. To be clear up front: Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker is not a bad film. It’s fun! Sort of. It’s satisfying! Kind of. It’s... a bit all over the place. And once again we see that Abrams is a great imitator but an average innovator. A key question has always hung over this trilogy ever since Disney acquired Lucasfilm for $4 billion in 2012: can they reconjure the particular magic of the original while avoiding the airless CGI cartoony of the prequels? And they have, to an extent. But what’s clear from this film is how much the original cast – Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, the de facto stars of the first two films – have been papering over the cracks. Carrie Fisher’s Leia was due to star here, but her role is naturally reduced to a bit part using old footage after her untimely passing. And so, we finally get a Star Wars film entirely propped up by our new youthful leads. The results are... not great. Daisy Ridley’s Rey is once again, of course, star of the show, and Adam Driver is fine, as far as emo-teen Sith goes, but truly, what is the point of Finn and Poe? No slight on either John Boyega or Oscar Isaac – hell, the latter is one of the best actors of his generation – but neither's character were ever given anything approaching a personality (I can just imagine Isaac asking about the motivation of his ace pilot and simply being told: “He’s an ace pilot. That’s his personality”). Both are nice, loyal, pure of heart... and about as exciting as being digested by a sarlacc over a thousand years. Genuine gags – the kind that actually make you laugh – are almost nonexistent. When, in some form, an old favourite does pop up, the screening I was in collectively whooped. As Yoda might put it: personality, the film finally contains. Which brings us to the trailer. There’s an argument to be made that the trailer for the first film in this trilogy and the now immortal Harrison Ford line – “Chewie... we’re home” – was so stirring and exciting and hair-on-your-neck-raising that none of the actual films have been able to match it. That’s also true here but for a different reason. Where Disney were Scrooge-like with their Avengers: Endgame trailers – giving away hardly any of the film itself beyond the first 15 minutes – it’s truly hard to give away much of a spoiler here as every single location is one you’ve already seen. Don’t get me wrong, they’re beautiful – dark storm planets with a new fleet awaiting, ice islands where the water mirrors the sky – but nothing is discovered afresh. The same goes for the set pieces. All the memorable ones – Rey backflipping over an on-rushing Tie fighter, Rey and Kylo Ren having a dramatic lightsaber fight on the high seas, even the flipping horses galloping across a spaceship – are already in your memory. Guys, you could have at least left the horses on a spaceship for the film itself! But then the film does feel like an extended version of the trailer, and not entirely in a good way. It’s fun but it’s relentless: manically daisy-chaining lightsaber fight with chase sequence with another lightsaber fight with another chase sequence... there’s no room to breathe. Gone is the textured world building that first let us understand what life is like on the ice world of Hoth before the bad guys show up and start shooting. Here it’s more like a computer game: the bad guys show up instantly as soon as a new level loads. There are also so many aspects of the second film that this finale either entirely upends or boldly ignores: it’s as if Rian Johnson, director of the middle film The Last Jedi, and Abrams have been playing a multibillion dollar franchise game of Consequences, the childhood game where a story is written one sentence at a time, with each person not knowing the line that came before. It’s only three films – how hard could working out one story from the get-go have been? (On the subject of which, I’m now so confused about what the Force actually is and what it does. It started off, as Obi-Wan Kenobi once told us, as “an energy field created by all living things” that “surrounds us and penetrates us” and “binds the galaxy together”. You could move things, tell brilliant lies, see dead people, know when planets have exploded and tell when guests had arrived without them ringing the bell. And while the prequel trilogy turned the Force from an ancient religion into something you got tested for – “I’m sorry to have to inform you, sir, the results came back... negative Yoda” – this follow-up trilogy has weirdly turned it into a communications device: part chatline for the Dark Side-curious, part FaceTime for those who want to play tricks on their former apprentices. The Rise Of Skywalker adds another huge upgrade, which must come as a shock to the thousand generations of Jedi that came before and had been stuck on Force 1.0 all that time). And so, finally, where does it leave us? The ending – don’t worry, no spoilers – is thrilling but feels curiously unearned, not least as it manages to feel like the ending of this film alone rather than the last part of a coherent trilogy. I suspect the fan boys who hated The Last Jedi will be elated – hell, the film sometimes feels like it’s written based on a check-list of Reddit forum grievances – but to the rest I suspect it'll feel more like an actual rollercoaster than an emotional one: you’ll end it feeling a bit giddy, a bit dazed and wondering what the hell just happened.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","Overall, I enjoyed the film and I do plan to go back and watch it again, but I don't feel as strongly about going back and watching it as I have in the past with other Star Wars movies.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," After the fanboy backlash associated with director Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi,” J. J. Abrams stepped in to helm the final installment in the new trilogy. Also known as “Episode IX,” “The Rise of Skywalker” picks up right after the epic defeat of the First Order. The Resistance, led by General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher, using unreleased footage from “The Force Awakens”), is continuing their fight. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Supreme Leader of the First Order, is searching for a magical way-finder device to lead him to the mysterious Sith headquarters. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last Jedi, trains under the tutelage of Leia. Rey and Ren continue to engage in their mind-link love affair, as Ren’s murderous rampage leaves stacks of bodies in its wake. Naturally, Rey decides to search for the way-finder, as well, and with her is crack pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), and series regular Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). The race to locate the way-finder is on. In addition to combating the Empire, the goal of the Resistance is to prevent the rise of a Sith new wave, suitably dubbed “The Final Order.” And the Sith leader, a resurgent Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), has secret plans for Rey and Ren. An unapologetic space opera, “The Rise of Skywalker” introduces an extensive collection of characters and plot elements, many of which are just plain silly. One thread concerns Finn, and a relationship with another orphan turned former stormtrooper, marooned on a planet covered mostly with water. This “Lord of the Flies” grouping has the inhabitants riding alien horses that ridiculously factor in later. Instead of chronicling a couple of characters, the script, from Abrams and Chris Terrio, working from a story by them and co-creators Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, tries valiantly to wrap up everyone and everything in the “Star Wars” universe. Don’t expect any end tags or cliffhangers, “The Rise of Skywalker” is a movie that ends a franchise. It might also kill that franchise, as well. Finding plot holes isn’t hard here. And without spoiling the narrative, I can’t focus on them with any specificity. But, as we all know, stormtroopers are as clumsy and dim-witted as ever. They are, as we learned from this new trilogy, orphans that are working against their will for the Empire. But without any reservation, Finn and our other heroes indiscriminately gun them down. And this time, we see how useless the cumbersome white armor is. At one point, an arrow kills a stormtrooper. And later, another arrow proves to be far more accurate and effective than a laser blaster. More than any film since the prequels, “The Rise of Skywalker” lays bare the foolishness of the series. It’s infuriating and pointless. Giving the fans their wish means that plenty of franchise veterans make appearances, regardless of their former fates. Fisher, brought to us with intelligent use of previously unreleased footage, delivers the film’s best performance. And because we know that Fisher, sadly, passed away in 2016, her appearance is certainly bittersweet. But instead of giving her a proper sendoff, “Rise” is jokey and nonsensical. Nothing in this movie has much tangible or emotional weight. Emotions are as alien as the fantastic characters that litter the film’s outer space landscapes. And the effects, while top-notch, are often shrouded in shadow, making you squint to capture details. Having now spent my entire life with the “Star Wars” series, if nothing else, ""Rise"" allows me and many others to close that chapter. But the effect of box office concerns and the social media outcry has ensured that only franchise purists will be entirely happy with this saccharine conclusion. For those devoted to the material, the excellent Disney+ series “The Mandalorian” is a good example of what can be done moving forward. When this final trilogy entry draws to a close, it drips wet with nostalgia. Perhaps in desperation, Abrams recycles, for no logical narrative purpose, an iconic shot from the movie that started it all back in 1977. This shot is like a bandaid slapped on a gushing wound. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” is the mortal injury that obnoxious fans and Disney deserve.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars:El ascenso de Skywalker, el capítulo final a la saga galáctica, el adiós a la dinastía Skywalker tras 42 años, tiene acción, claro, humor, revelaciones y respuestas. ¿Es divertida? Es divertida. ¿Es entretenida? Lo es. ¿Tiene todo lo que quieren los fans? Tal vez, no todo. O no todo tan así. Pero la satisfacción está garantizada. Tiene una primera mitad, o una primera hora, para ser exactos, hasta “la revelación”, en la que la película ofrece como nuevas subtramas y es, a la vez, la más simple y aniñada de las tres de esta última trilogía. Star Wars: ​El ascenso de Skywalker es, hasta allí, lo que Star Wars:​ El regreso del Jedi fue a la trilogía original. Lo que sigue no es spoiler, porque sucede al comienzo: Palpatine vuelve de la muerte (¡!) y le promete todo a Kylo Ren, el nuevo Líder Supremo, para rearmar un gran Imperio contra la Resistencia, que ya era mínima al final de Star Wars:​ Los últimos Jedi. “La llama Sith emergerá”, se dirá más adelante. La Orden Final está por armarse. La Primera Orden fue sólo el comienzo. Palpatine está obsesionado, parece, con que Rey muera. ¿Quién es esa chica? Desde Star Wars:​ El despertar de la Fuerza nos preguntamos por sus padres. Kylo la quiere pasar al Lado Oscuro. Lo que muchos sienten es que el problema de la nueva trilogía es que los nuevos personajes (Poe Damron, Finn, Rey), a excepción de Ben/Kylo, no tienen el mismo carisma que tenían Luke, Han y Leia hace 42 años. Por más que Leia le dé el sable de su hermano Luke a Rey, y que le diga “Nunca tengas miedo de ser quién eres”. Entre presentimientos y visiones, los mundos virtuales que se cruzan (algo muy del director J.J. Abrams, de Lost a esta parte), tal vez haya demasiados encuentros entre la rebelde Rey y el oscuro Kylo Ren. Como en todas las películas de la saga creada por George Lucas, El ascenso de Skywalker está trabajada, cosida de acuerdo a misiones por realizar. Aquí, entre otras, hay que ir a Exegol para derrotar a Palpatine, pero para ello hay primero que encontrar un orientador Sith, el mismo que Luke había ido a buscar, para poder llegar a Palpatine. Hay un momento western, hay un espía entre los malvados. Hay una reaparición (además de la de Palpatine, y la del querido Lando Calrissian), una revelación que lo cambia todo, o casi, y otra muerte. Hasta que llegue, como todos sabemos y esperamos, el combate final. ¿Entre quiénes? Será por la galaxia. Y por Leia. Así como los stormtroopers ahora pueden realizar otra cosa con sus cuerpos, no todos sabíamos, aunque lo intuíamos, que la energía de la Fuerza puede sanar cuerpos y tal vez alma o espíritus. Es que El ascenso de Skywalker debe dar muchas respuestas, cuando El despertar de la Fuerza nos llenaba de nuevas preguntas en el relanzamiento de la saga. En esta película se hace más evidente que en otras cómo John Williams editorializa con los acordes musicales. Y la pelea, una de las tantas, entre Rey y Kylo, en las ruinas de lo que fue la Estrella de la muerte, con olas altísimas azotando el lugar, es uno de los momentos cumbres de la película. El ascenso de Skywalker da el cierre. J.J. Abrams, desde el guión, sorprende, claro con la revelación, y luego ofrece lo que los fans desean. Esa adrenalina mezclada con tristeza, esa emoción porque se acerca el final. Es un digno cierre, más a tono de la primera saga que lo que fue la trilogía precuela a los Episodios IV, V y VI. Acción.

"Dec 18, 2019"," This is a special effects film that far exceeds expectations in that category.  If only it could have been equivalent in the story telling category as well!  This lackluster continuation of a saga that has been a part of generations pulls at our nostalgic heartstrings, but even this isn’t enough to keep us focused on the shell of a story and its “new” characters.   When you connect more with Chewbacca and the emotional trauma he or any of the droids go through than with the humans, it’s not a good sign.  While Daisy Ridley portrays Rey,  a strong woman attempting to be the next Jedi, her co-horts comprised of Poe (Oscar Isaac) who is completely miscast, and Finn (John Boyega) who finds one note throughout the film and plays it, unfortunately she can’t carry the film.  General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) have some of the best scenes, but  there aren’t enough of them.  With a couple nostalgic twists and turns, this newest and very long final (?) installment will be as memorable as “The Phantom Menace.”",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," The supposed final chapter of the original Star Wars saga has arrived, and while reviews and fan reactions are destined to be mixed, there’s no doubt the Christmas season release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will dominate the box office and give Disney their final $1+ billion earner of 2019, boosting the studio’s total annual box office to $11 billion. The only question is, can Rise of Skywalker bring the iconic 42-year series to a satisfying conclusion for audiences? How we each answer that question depends greatly on our own point of view, but one thing seems inevitable — this will be the most controversial chapter of the saga. First, let’s get financials out the way, since that’s the easy part. This is the final chapter of Star Wars, at least in terms of the original cast and storylines, and at least for three or so years. Even accounting for the mixed reactions to 2017’s The Last Jedi (which “only” made $1.3 billion as the second-highest grossing film of the franchise) and the failure of Solo: A Star Wars Story (which took a low $393 million last year, after moving the franchise from Christmas to summer and replacing Harrison Ford in a beloved role amid months of negative buzz about a troubled production), Rise of Skywalker is still a returning cast from two billion-plus performers in one of the most successful and popular movie franchises of all time. There’s little competition at the box office, and plenty of breathless anticipation from tens of millions of fans and mainstream viewers worldwide who liked both of the previous movies — or at least, loved one of them and are willing to shell out the price of a ticket to see how it all ends. There is almost no realistic scenario — aside from ones involving a large meteor strike — in which Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker grosses less than $1 billion in global receipts. Tracking points to a worldwide debut weekend that could reach $500 million, so a terrible final multiplier of just 2x would put the latest Star Wars chapter into $1 billion territory. For comparison and what to expect, The Last Jedi opened to $450 million and finished at $1.33 billion, for a final multiplier of 2.9x. So yes, The Rise of Skywalker will break the billion dollar barrier. Lower end of my expectations comes it at $460 million opening, final multiplier of 2.8x, and a roughly $1.28 billion final cume. Now, the high end is where it’s more fun to speculate, because if The Rise of Skywalker took $500 million this weekend, and if it has a 3.4x final multiplier (right in the middle of The Force Awakens’ and The Last Jedi’s final multipliers), then that would be good enough to send the new film toward $1.7 billion and making it the sixth-highest grossing movie in cinema history. But I don’t expect a best-case or worst-case scenario for The Rise of Skywalker. My guess is an opening in the $480+/- million range, a final multiplier of about 3x, for a grand total of approximately $1.4 billion, give or take. Which is more than enough for Disney-Lucasfilm to shout “victory!” and have a Merry Christmas. Some quick thoughts about the future beyond The Rise of Skywalker: First and foremost, no I don’t think this is the last Star Wars movie, nor do I believe it will really be the last movie with the Skywalkers in it. I believe there will be a lot more Disney+ streaming series based on Star Wars, akin to the footprint Marvel’s cinematic universe will have on the platform. I believe there’s a strong chance Kevin Feige’s first Star Wars movie is going to be an audition for taking the reins at Lucasfilm after Kathleen Kennedy moves on. And most importantly, I think despite the current controversies and debates among fans and the press over the future of Star Wars, the franchise will be fine and continue releasing successful movies and streaming shows while selling billions of dollars worth of merchandise. No movie ever has or ever will “ruin Star Wars,” except for that small number of folks whose ability to love and enjoy things is so shallow and fragile as to crumble if challenged or if suffering a few stumbles. Nobody will come to your house and smash your Blu-rays and toys if you don’t like the new movie, and nobody is attacking you personally by liking or disliking a film you feel differently about. It’s an imaginary story about magic samurai with laser swords in space, people. Calm down. I saw The Rise of Skywalker at the Los Angeles premiere, hosted at the Dolby Theatre along the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I’ve been lucky enough to attend most of the Star Wars premieres, which is an especially good thing because (as you know if you read my work regularly) I am obsessed about where I see my movies and how I experience them — once I’ve found what I feel to be the best experience, that’s how I prefer to see my films from that point forward. When I find such a thing, then I bang that drum for other fans to let them know and to convince them to give it a try, because I happen to care about how you and everyone else experience movies, too. In this case, the Dolby Theatre experience is my favorite by a wide margin. I’m color blind, and Dolby Vision produces colors I can’t usually see, because the contrast ratio is so exceptional (the ratio in Dolby Vision is 1:1,000,000 while the ratio in most other high-end theaters is at best 1:8,000). Likewise, Dolby Atmos is unparalleled in audio, moving sound through the 3D space in the theater around me. All of this matters. A lot. If you haven’t experienced it yet, you don’t know what you’re missing. Here’s a trick: the next time you’re watching a show or film at a theater or on your TV, during a scene with supposed “shadows” and blackness, compare the darkness on the screen to something that’s really black in the room. What you’ll discover is, the “black” on the screen isn’t really black at all, it’s a murky dark gray. Similarly, the whitest white you’re likely to experience on other movie screens and TVs is not bright enough to make you squint. Dolby Vision has absolute black and absolute white, and everything in between, including colors that have never been produced before. It completely changes the quality and experience of anything you watch in the format. That’s why this matters so much to me, and why it should matter to you, too. Anyway, the premiere was a blast, and how could it not be? The stars were there, the filmmakers were there, the entire strip of Hollywood Boulevard was converted into a giant covered party space with props, ships, a Star Wars themed design, Dolby’s Star Wars Infinity Room, and a crowd of Hollywood who’s who talking and drinking and sharing the excitement of the a new Star Wars movie. When we walked into that giant theater space — it’s the same one you see every year for the Oscars, except there’s a giant movie screen put in for the screening — the balconies and red curtains and history of the place all combine to take your breath away. I sat in the orchestra section, eight rows from the screen, and let me tell you it’s one of the best viewing experiences I’ve had at a premiere, which is fitting since this was (supposedly) our final visit with the Skywalker clan to a galaxy far, far away. I’ve been on this journey since childhood, when as a small boy I saw the very first Star Wars movie on its original theatrical run, so regardless of what I thought about the movie itself, when I finally walked in and sat down in my seat, I took a moment to let the full weight of it all to settle over me. And then it was time... Now let’s get to it — how good is The Rise of Skywalker? The short answer is, it’s good enough that most audiences will like it, most fans will like it, and most critics will like it (“most”). It’s in the unenvious position of having to bridge two disparate visions and two films’ divergent plot threads, while bringing the overarching narrative of eight movies to an end without causing fandom to riot, and despite some of the more hyperbolic things you may have heard so far about it, The Rise of Skywalker mostly manages to accomplish its goals. It is probably the best we were going to get out of this situation, regardless of how you feel about both/either of the previous two movies. And for the record, I happen to have liked both The Force Awakens and The Rise of Skywalker, while having complaints about both of them — just as I have complaints about things in all of the previous Star Wars movies, even though I love this series and like or love all of the films (yes, even the prequels). All of that said, there will also be plenty of debate and controversy about The Rise of Skywalker among people who only liked one of the previous revival films (The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi). Some people who loved one or both previous films will wind up disappointed that this film ignored most of the second one while offering a distilled version of what its own story was meant to be (for reasons I’ll explain in a moment). It’s a good film, but not a film that will make everyone happy. Now, here’s my longer analysis: The Rise of Skywalker makes it clear just how incongruous the storytelling has been overall in the main Star Wars series of films since 2015. When he made The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams clearly intended for specific story arcs to be addressed in a second and third film, setting up plenty of mysteries and threads that seemed to have solid implications for the future of the series. But most of those plans and ideas were jettisoned by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi. Which, to be very clear here, was entirely his right as a storyteller, and Lucasfilm agreed to let him do it. The resulting story, while a surprise and not the direction set up by The Force Awakens, was good and entertaining (audiences agree with me, grading it an “A”), and a big hit at the box office (again, no matter how you feel about the movie, it grossed $1.33 billion and it would be absurd to call that anything other than a success). It’s odd to have a trilogy bookended by two films telling one story, and a middle one largely unrelated to the main story of the bookending films, but that's what this wound up being. There were obviously certain plans for a few specific storylines set up in The Force Awakens, including Rey’s search for her family, Kylo’s struggle between his good and evil natures, the mythology and lore of the Jedi and Sith, Luke mentoring and possibly training (with Leia’s help, I bet) Rey, and a few other clear threads intended to play out in the subsequent films. It seems Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio (one of my personal favorite writers working in film today) wound up crunching Abrams’ two planned sequel stories together into a single film (perhaps “imagined” is a better term than “planned,” since I don’t think it was all necessarily literally written out as a detailed plan). This required the first 15 minutes or so of Rise of Skywalker to do rapid-fire major information-dumping to summarize what would’ve otherwise been set up in the second movie, and then the rest of the film is a combination of those things playing out within a whole planned third story that had to be condensed during the back half of this movie. Despite some bumps in the road and the obviousness of the fact Rise of Skywalker is doing a lot of retconning and reworking of original intentions, it still manages to pull it off pretty well. It’s not the ideal situation nor the ideal way for things to have played out, but it’s probably the best it was going to be after the first two movies went in different directions as they did. And there are many great action sequences, truly moving emotional payoffs, and what winds up being a nice blend of tone from the previous two films in a story that reworks Abrams’ original ideas within the changed landscape established by Johnson’s ideas. It’s a combination of sorts of the two, although it obviously favors Abrams’ vision since he is the director again — and let me just say, if you argued strenuously (and correctly) that Johnson had every right to pursue his own artistic vision even if it meant scrapping Abrams’ plans, then surely you’ll feel the same way about Abrams choosing his own approach and vision when he took over for this final film. Right? Imagine the darker tone of The Last Jedi, some thematic and plotting influence from The Return of the Jedi, the overall stylistic approach and characters who were the focus of The Force Awakens, and that’s a good idea of what to expect from The Rise of Skywalker. It even manages a few surprises along the way (one in particular brought the house down at the premiere). Most people who liked the previous two movies will probably like this one overall, even if they don’t love it. The more someone liked The Force Awakens, the more likely they are to like The Rise of Skywalker. But the more they like The Last Jedi, the less likely they are to like The Rise of Skywalker. There will be a subset of people who liked or loved The Force Awakens, who loves this one even more. But there will also be a subset of people who loved The Force Awakens, but who dislike this one worse than The Last Jedi because it represents the impact of that latter film on the original plans established in the prior film. Overall, most people who watch it will like it, but most of that majority will like this movie less than they liked one of the other two films. Meaning The Rise of Skywalker will wind up as most people’s second-favorite film of the new trilogy, while separate groups will either love it most of all or hate it most of all. In particular, younger fans who were introduced to Star Wars via these new films will probably like this film the most, while older fans will find plenty to enjoy as well. As I said before, I liked it even though I had mixed reactions to some elements. I could see the seams showing, so to speak, and that was frustrating since it kept bringing to mind how much better this or that thing would’ve worked if it had been set up in the second film. I like The Force Awakens the most of this new trilogy, and I like The Rise of Skywalker second-most. However, even though The Last Jedi is in third place in my assessment and I have issues with some parts of it (not for the reasons a lot of reactionary fans complain, though), I still also like it and have watched it several times, and I don’t resent it at all. The Rise of Skywalker isn’t a perfect Star Wars film by a long shot, but it’s also far from the worst of the series. It’s a good but flawed movie, and in the final estimation it definitely overcomes those flaws to provide an acceptable and entertaining conclusion to the Skywalker saga.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," En 1982, mientras remataba la primera trilogía de Star Wars, George Lucas debió sentirse a veces como si Juan Pardo, José Vélez y una legión de tuertos le hubieran mirando fijamente mientras hacían con los dedos el signo del mal de ojo. Nacida de un parto monstruosamente difícil, El retorno del Jedi acabó siendo una película irregular, infantil en el peor sentido, culpable de reciclar ideas del primer capítulo de la saga… y que sin embargo uno podía defender apelando a su encanto innegable, a su conmovedora redención final y, si estaba de buenas, a sus ewoks. Escudos todos ellos de los que carece El ascenso de Skywalker.  La película con la que J. J. Abrams pretende marcar un antes y un después en el serial encara esta tarea, ya de por si ingrata, como un leviatán contrahecho (un bantha de Tatooine, si se prefiere) que intentara correr como un guepardo, desplomándose en el proceso bajo la masa de su grandilocuencia, sus ocurrencias de última hora y, en fin, de un pasado del que no sabe ni quiere escapar. Solo que, a diferencia de Lucas, Abrams solo puede excusarse con imponderables como el despido de Colin Trevorrow. Los problemas de la cinta están ahí porque él, o Disney, o ambos, lo han querido. El aspecto más irritante de El ascenso…, y el responsable de muchos de sus defectos, es que parece una operación de control de daños destinada a borrar del mapa a su predecesora, Los últimos Jedi. Sea porque Disney se ha tomado a pecho los espasmos del fandom más cerril o porque a Abrams le dolieron las libertades de Rian Johnson más de lo que pensamos, esta película dedica sus primeros 30 minutos, tirando por lo bajo, a barrer del mapa todas las conclusiones a las que llegaba la anterior película, para a continuación llenar su metraje con escenas que se quieren el no va más de lo épico. Debido a ello, el espectador se enfrenta a un montaje agotador, hiperveloz, sin esos momentos de respiro que permitían a las entregas anteriores de Star Wars (entre ellas, El despertar de la Fuerza, firmada por el propio Abrams) dejar que leudase su sentido de la maravilla. Aquellos que acusaron a Johnson de no respetar el canon de la saga lo pasarán ahora de lo lindo tratando de justificar esas salidas de tiesto (algunas directamente bochornosas, como las referidas a la princesa Leia) merced a las cuales el argumento se llena de giros que las dos películas anteriores no habían preparado y ante los que sus protagonistas reaccionan de formas que nunca llegan a importarnos del todo porque no sirven a su desarrollo como personajes, sino a la preparación del clímax final. Como sabemos, las películas de samuráis fueron una inspiración decisiva para Star Wars. Y, viendo El ascenso de Skywalker, uno piensa que Abrams debería haber tenido en cuenta aquella máxima del Hagakure según la cual los asuntos leves han de tomarse con seriedad, reservando la levedad para las cuestiones de vida o muerte. Tal vez así esta película le habría hecho justicia a una saga cuyos méritos han estado muchas veces por encima de los de sus responsables. Tal vez así la Star Wars que muchos conocimos de niños habría tenido un final a su altura. La nueva trilogía llega a su fin con el Episodio IX de 'Star Wars'. La historia continua los hechos ocurridos en 'Los últimos Jedi'. Rey, Finn, Poe y el resto de rebeldes deberán de enfrentarse a la amenaza de la Primera Orden y el Lado Oscuro en una trama que promete ser el cierre sobre la familia Skywalker. ¿Acompañará la Fuerza a J.J.

"Dec 18, 2019","  More ambitious than perhaps anyone suspected, director J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Rise of the Skywalker not only concludes the Skywalker Saga but also takes a loving, and definitive, look at the core concepts of the 42-year-old franchise. It's occasionally sloppy in its storytelling, but the film's cast, visuals, action and through-line come together to make a thrilling and fitting finale.   The film never slows down, with the opening crawl casually revealing that Emperor Palpatine is alive and has broadcast that to the galaxy. He's even shown to have a massive army that he's amassed in the decades since the fall of the Empire. The Resistance is forced into an almost no-win scenario, and so Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8 and C-3PO must make their way across the galaxy to find a Sith Wayfinder -- a map that can lead them to Palpatine.   Complicating matters is Kylo Ren, who's working gain access to Palpatine's army. Alongside the Knights of Ren, all Palpatine requests of Kylo is to kill Rey. But Kylo's connection with Rey makes that more difficult, and opens up the possibility of one of them giving in to the other's side of the Force.   The script, by Abrams and Chris Terrio, moves at a fast clip, which instills the movie with an unrelenting sense of urgency. But that also means some sequences and revelations unfold quickly, leaving the audience little time to adjust to the new information before blasting off to a new location. That's probably the roughest aspect of The Rise of Skywalker, leaving viewers with more questions than answers.   However, it also imbues the film with a frenetic energy that such an ambitious finale requires to accomplish what it has set out to do. The film doesn't only resolve plot threads left dangling in the new trilogy, it's willing to explore some of the biggest thematic elements of the series. It's an ambitious decision that brings with it an appropriate weight. If the sacrifice for the sheer scale of The Rise of Skywalker is to move at lightspeed, then it's well worth the rapid-fire revelations and rewrites that bring the story to an satisfying, and emotional, conclusion.   The characters feel fully fleshed out in a way they hadn't even in the previous films, allowing the natural chemistry among Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac to carry the movie when plot contrivances threaten to upend it. Adam Driver brings a surprising complexity to Kylo, especially as his relationship with Rey becomes more fraught. Familiar faces from the earlier movies also appear, with actors like Ian McDiarmid and Billy Dee Williams easily readjusting to their decades-old roles. Even new faces, like Keri Russel as the mysterious Zorii and Naomi Ackie as the heroic Jannah, feel fully integrated into this universe, rather than mere scene-fillers.   Abrams proves to be the perfect director for the film, keeping the focus largely on the characters. When it goes big -- and it frequently does -- Abrams shows off his keen eye for action. The Rise of Skywalker never becomes lost in its epic visuals, but instead maintains a focus on the characters and their goals. Indeed, the visuals are also among the most impressive in the entire series, with cinematographer Dan Mindel bringing a great deal of style.   At times, the film feels like a response to the ideas presented by Rian Johnson in The Last Jedi, but it never outright undoes those elements. Instead, it tries to blend together each part of the Star Wars saga to weave a story about the Force and choosing to embrace it (and yourself) instead of allowing the universe to decide for you.   Some might have thought it impossible, but Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is able to clear the massive expectations to close out the Skywalker Saga on a high note.   Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams, and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film opens Friday nationwide.  Tom Hanks has had many famous roles in dozens of iconic movies. But from Big to Toy Story, what are some of the best movies he's been in?",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," When J.J. Abrams' The Force Awakens hit theaters in 2015, the new Star Wars trilogy carried an electric energy along with it. The movie, with an exciting cast of rising stars playing characters that immediately clicked and franchise legends Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, and Mark Hamill reprising their famous roles, felt like an event, one that portended a wise path for a George Lucas-less incarnation of the tale. Four years later, this latest trilogy's final installment, The Rise of Skywalker, has arrived and the fanfare has dimmed considerably. There is little triumph in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Instead, the movie plays out like a confusing sequel to a film that doesn't exist. The bones of what made the new era of the saga exciting -- the talented, appealing actors, the charming practical effects and creatures -- are still there, but it's all mired in a plot that's as sludgy as planet Dagobah. Of course, discussing The Rise of Skywalker requires relitigating its predecessor, Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi. The film, critically successful and a massive box-office success, was the subject of intense backlash, for reasons ranging from purported plot holes, and Johnson's reimagining of beloved characters to despicable racism and misogyny. Back at the helm of the franchise, Abrams appears to have been intent on course-correcting from where Johnson took the trilogy, throwing out or retconning many ideas introduced in The Last Jedi to match a heretofore nonexistent narrative. This is to say if you liked, as I did, the existential and playful direction Johnson took with the franchise -- in which both characters and audiences were made to interrogate their pre-established opinions on Star Wars lore --  you're bound to be disappointed. If you didn't, well, you might still be at least underwhelmed with the haphazard way in which Abrams chose to bring this all to a close.  If you want to go into The Rise of Skywalker without knowing literally anything about the plot, it'd be best to stop reading here, but these don't really count as spoilers, per se. As indicated by the trailers, Abrams' biggest and boldest move is bringing back Ian McDiarmid's Emperor Palpatine as the principal villain -- in other words, an ex machina villain who had never been mentioned as a relevant player in this timeline. The opening crawl explains that the galaxy has been besieged by mysterious broadcasts coming from the thought-to-be-dead Sith Lord. Palpatine's always been a frustrating puppet-master type whose maniacal brand of evil isn't as compelling as his more fallible counterparts, and it turns out he's serving the same function here. After Adam Driver's brooding Kylo Ren locates the source of these messages in the opening sequence, the rest of the film finds our good guys trying to get to the same location to save the day. In the case of Daisy Ridley's Jedi-in-training Rey, this particular journey will also mean coming to terms with her own history. (Yes, we find out more about who Rey is, and yes, there will be thousands of takes on this matter.) From the outset, the whole mission immediately registers as inorganic thanks to dialogue that labors to dump all the info necessary to understanding just what the hell is going on. The natural chemistry between Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac -- as Rey, Finn, and Poe -- do wonders to keep matters entertaining, for the most part, even when the mechanics around what their characters are doing border on nonsensical. This trio -- along with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and BB-8 -- are given the bulk of the screen time, at least when it comes to the Resistance. Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico, a standout in The Last Jedi, is sidelined here almost entirely, her diminished screen time an unfortunate casualty of Abrams' rebuke of what came before. New characters, like Naomi Ackie's Jannah and Keri Russell's Zorii Bliss, are given little in the way of character development before it's time to move onto the next planet. Even the posthumous appearance of Carrie Fisher as General Leia using footage salvaged from The Force Awakens feels hurried, though at least it results in a touching send off for the character and her portrayer. For all the complaints I've registered above, The Rise of Skywalker isn't completely devoid of pleasures. There are fun new aliens like Babu Frik, a little tinkerer who sounds vaguely like a Brooklyn wiseguy, and battles staged in gorgeously rendered landscapes, including a waterlogged fight between Kylo Ren and Rey on the remnants of the second Death Star. That fight also serves an emotional centerpiece, and highlights the power of Adam Driver's work in which malice and sweat coalesce into heartbreaking agony. It's a credit to Driver, finishing a banner year, that Kylo's arc ends up being the most moving on screen. The Rise of Skywalker aims to wrap up in a way that quote-unquote satisfies viewers, offering answers for just about everything. But to tie up all those loose ends and give the people what he thinks they want, Abrams sacrifices some of his movie's soul. By the end, all these big adventures in a galaxy far, far away end up seeming rather small.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," For the last two years, director Rian Johnson and “The Last Jedi” have been on the receiving end of a backlash from a large contingent of “Star Wars” fans. Johnson’s creative decisions pleased film critics, but hardcore Star Wars loyalists despised the fresh new direction Johnson took with the “Last Jedi.” There was no catering to fans, and risks were taken in the narrative (more sacrilege), however, Johnson’s deconstruction of Star Wars lore, including doing a 180 of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker by having him do things which, shall we say, went against the “spirit” of the beloved four-decade-old character.  Is it then any surprise that, despite the critical acclaim, Johnson did not return to direct “The Rise of Skywalker”? Instead, we get JJ Abrams, returning after directing the safe but entertaining first chapter, 2015’s “The Force Awakens.”  I can tell you that the film fails because Abrams does exactly the opposite of what Johnson did — he appeases to the loyalists. Abrams has listened to the fans and has course-corrected the trajectory of Johnson’s “Last Jedi.” Whether that will work on the viewer will entirely depend on the individual, but I can tell you that where Johnson joyously succeeded, Abrams fails.  You can tell by watching ’The Rise of Skywalker’  that George Lucas had a major say in its creative development — after all, Lucasfilm head Kathleen Kennedy and Abrams have admitted to meeting Lucas and “taking down a lot of notes” for this final chapter. This is a film jammed, a little too strenuously, with Star Wars lore. Disney wanted a “course correction” and they’ve delivered it here. Whether that’s good or bad will, of course, depend on the viewer. I wasn’t impressed. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” goes back to the spirit of Saturday matinees which was all over the prequel trilogy. This “final” chapter in the Skywalker Saga is a long, meandering and messy chase movie that sends characters scrambling from mission to mission but never truly finding a groove of its own. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is still distraught about the mystery of her family tree; Kylo Ren, the villain of the trilogy (Adam Driver), has a major vendetta against her and the resistance. But, really, for Abrams, this was a reason to finally unite Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). It’s a chase movie, filled with silly jokes, action and tons of nostalgia. If Johnson looked ahead, Abrams looks backward, and that’ll suffice for many who were turned off by Rian Johnson’s vision. Billy Dee Williams, reprising Lando Calrissian, is a much-welcomed returning face. But the most interesting and well-rendered part of this final chapter is the way Carrie Fisher’s Leia is used. I was stunned by how much useable footage of Carrie Fisher’s performance Disney had in their vaults. The film turns into this sweet little love letter to Leia/Carrie. It’s all crafted effortlessly and in very good taste. Carrie would have approved.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker may be a tale of identity and faith but it is a film that lacks both. The film is so concerned with quelling the unjust online vitriol that The Last Jedi received that it loses sight of its own distinct vision.  Much like Rey’s quest to understand who she is, the film struggles to find the right balance between the nostalgia that J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens cruised on and the brilliant new roads Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi boldly paved. Abrams clearly wants The Rise of Skywalker to be yet another trip down memory lane.  It does not trust that audiences can handle the franchise moving towards the future, so it cements itself in the past. The film feels like a greatest hits album of lightsaber fights, space dogfights, and planet destroying weapons, but performed by a younger band. The fascinating thing about the film though is that its best moments arrive when it builds on the work that The Last Jedi put in.  Johnson’s film not only allows Abrams to investigate the real powers of the Jedi, but also explore the dark side of the force as well. One of the annoying things about the Star Wars prequels was that they introduced audiences to several powerful Jedis who spent most of their time sitting around in a conference room.  They talked a big game about the power of the force, which flows through all who open their minds to it; but could not detect the uber villain in their midst.  It was just accepted that the dark side is so blindingly seductive and powerful that even Jedi Masters do not understand it. Those enabling the dark side of the force are who Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), set out to find when a mysterious radio transmission with the voice of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), believed to be dead, is heard across the galaxy. Determined to uncover who is behind the message, the trio along with Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO and BB-8 race to locate a rare Sith tracking device that will lead them to the source of the transmission.  However, they are not the only ones searching for the Emperor.  Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is on his own fact-finding mission as he wants to ensure nothing threatens his placement atop the evil ladder. Along the way Rey, who is continuing to train as a Jedi, must confront the full extent of her abilities; as well as the complexities that comes from the evolving force-based link she has with Kylo Ren. Considering the extensive nature of the evil plot that is bubbling under the surface, it is baffling that so many characters would be unaware of what is really occurring. The sequences involving Emperor Palpatine, while the closest the film gets to the stunning visual flare of The Last Jedi, further emphasize this. Just as the Harry Potter franchise kept the focus on the principal three (Harry, Hermione and Ron) as they searched for horcruxes.  Abrams really tries to force-feed the bond between Rey, Poe and Finn.  He desperately wants them to be the new Luke, Han and Lelia, rather than their own unique entity.  Unfortunately, the film struggles to keep them together long enough to make this happen. Every mission involves them splitting up or Rey leaving them after sensing something in the distance. Furthermore, Rey and Poe only officially met at the end of The Last Jedi, so their interactions never develop naturally. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a complicated blend of contradictions. It lacks the balance it desperately seeks as it entertains and disappoints with equal measure.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The Star Wars saga, which began in 1977, had already cauterized its loose ends a couple of times — first with 1983’s “Return of the Jedi” and again with 2005’s “Revenge of the Sith.” Disney’s reboot brought us 2015’s “The Force Awakens” and 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” which each justified their existence in different and gratifying ways. Now we have “Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker,” the finale of this recent trilogy (the third of three, of course) and the ostensible payoff to what Lucasfilm owner Disney has dubbed The Skywalker Saga. As this strobe-lit behemoth swells in the deep, you can practically feel director J.J. Abrams and co-screenwriter Chris Terrio eyeing it warily in pre-release interviews. They’re right to be scared, since “The Rise of Skywalker” was predestined to go where both no one and everyone has gone before (apologies to the USS Enterprise). The movie picks up some time after “The Last Jedi” ended, our heroic Resistance having been cut down to a handful of survivors who escaped in the Millennium Falcon. There’s little to spoil in saying “The Rise of Skywalker” reintroduces Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who first appeared in “Return of the Jedi,” given that his spooky vocal-fry emanated from trailers earlier this year. “The dead speak!” the opening crawl informs. Palpatine has sent a mysterious message across the galaxy, and the good guys are desperate to understand it. In short succession, major moments from the trailers and TV ads fly across the screen, hinting that there’s much more to this film than what’s already been revealed. Well, there is and there isn’t. It’s at least refreshing to see so much visual ingenuity in an age when pop-culture thrills feel calculated to the penny. “The Rise of Skywalker” earns much of its affection with cameos, callbacks and other candy that will be best savored upon repeat viewings. General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), Stormtrooper-turned-rebel Finn (John Boyega) and smoldering commander Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) have re-formed a modest Resistance on a jungle planet, where would-be Jedi and former scavenger Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues training under the guidance of her new master, Leia. The unused footage from “The Force Awakens” that forms Leia’s character arc is thin but appreciated, and Abrams’ previous disavowal of using CGI to revive her isn’t exactly true. New Force powers (as in, really new) and terminology (lightspeed skipping?) quickly spirit us from Point A to Point Z and back again. Our heroes’ agitated momentum offers little emotional breathing room, particularly as characters new and old fill up the screen. Metaphors become literal as the film hangs some of its strongest plot mechanics on principals of physics, like the conservation of matter and energy, although many other developments stretch credulity (to put it lightly). Long-timers Chewbacca and C-3PO gain extra screen time and agency, and seeing Rey, Poe and Finn work as a team offers some fleeting pleasures. Like his foil Rey, Supreme Leader of the First Order Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is haunted by visions and phantoms, and Abrams constantly teases us with feints about his loyalty. Through spectacle and sheer force of will, it hangs together. But it’s the weakest film in this new trilogy, getting by on nostalgia where it could be bold and surprising. It invokes themes of birthright and inheritance raised in all Star Wars episodes thus far — of discovering and harnessing power that’s barely understood, and finding strength within and without. But “The Rise of Skywalker” retreats from anything truly revolutionary, even as modest progress is made in showing a kiss between two same-sex Resistance fighters, or hearing the voices of numerous female Stormtroopers. The question for fans isn’t what’s in this movie. You can practically see the checklist of speeder-bike chases, disguises, prison breaks, shifty friends, epic space battles and last-minute rescues being ticked off with efficiency. The question is what’s between it all, which themes are being honored or discarded, and why we should care. “The Rise of Skywalker” feels too jumbled and overcaffeinated to explore that. The story has neither the exacting pace of “The Force Awakens” nor the philosophical depth of “The Last Jedi,” bouncing as it does from planet to planet, battle to battle, in an effort to restore balance with nebulous stakes and meaning. It’s still a more competent, enthralling work than any of creator George Lucas’ dismal prequels. Casual fans will find it as accessible as anything in the canon. But it’s a step back from the boldness of “The Last Jedi,” maybe two. Notably, it doesn’t so much invalidate “Jedi” director Rian Johnson’s assertions (for example: that the incredibly powerful, Force-sensitive Rey came from nothing) as it does conveniently introduce knowledge that tempers them. If you carefully re-watch “The Force Awakens,” you’ll see that the biggest twists in “Skywalker” were telegraphed all along. “The Rise of Skywalker” is a solid movie by most standards, but it feels more like a market-driven product than its immediate predecessors. Few things could ever be as brilliant as Lucas’ original trilogy, but “Skywalker” at least gives us multifaceted new toys to hold up to the light, however plastic.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Writer-director J.J. Abrams returns with a mission to round off and gather in 42 years of intense – and occasionally toxic – fandom for a safe landing where everyone is satisfied. He also had to answer some of the big questions he set up in 2015’s The Force Awakens, a demanding feat given the amount of manoeuvring needed. Put it this way. If Abrams had kicked off the sequels with this much pace, energy and content, there would be far fewer nerves about this finale. They may well come at it from different angles – haters will say it’s correcting mistakes. Other will realise events in The Rise Of Skywalker would have little impact without the previous film. Emperor Palpatine appears to be back in some form after involuntarily base jumping down an exhaust shaft 36 years ago. He’s used his time well and poses an arguably greater threat to the galaxy than he did before.  Evil is champing at the bit, so it’s just as well that the main gang of Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are together for much of it – especially thanks to the bristling banter between Isaac and Boyega. The focus of the film though is centred on Rey, stuggling with the weight of needing to be a Jedi with being needed by the Resistance in the here and now. She’s also still haunted by her connection to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).  Kylo is never the most verbose of villains, but Driver shows there’s a lot going on under the surface – bubbling resentment, difficult urges and simmering rage mixed in with occasional vulnerability. There are thankfully only a few new faces, though Richard E. Grant, as a high-ranking general in the First Order, manages to stand out by relishing his moments of sheer malevolence. The Emperor scenes are the closest Star Wars gets to looking like a horror movie. If the kids don’t scream to leave in the cinema, there may well be some nightmares later. With Star Wars, one of the many arguments has always been about the amount of fan service. Well, of course seeing our heroes run from stormtroopers down a shiny Imperial corridor is going to evoke some memories. That can’t be helped that Star Wars contains elements of Star Wars. 
What must be applauded is how well the film handles the fact that Carrie Fisher died before production. Her presence as General Leia is seamless and suitably reverential to the role the beloved actress played in Star Wars' continued success. As someone for whom Star Wars had a direct influence since the age of four, it was daunting that with The Rise Of Skywalker – be it good or bad – this is the end point.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," In the weeks leading up to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the message was clear, “We’re going to answer your questions.” It’s true. They did. A lot of them. All at once. When the latest Star Wars trilogy started, fans all over the world wondered what direction it would take. Could it live up to the expectations of fans who’d waited decades to find out what happened to Luke, Leia, Han and so many others in that beloved galaxy far, far away? The Force Awakens delivered that information. Han and Leia got married and had a child. Leia was a General and the leader of the nascent Resistance, and Han Solo was… off being Han Solo.  Luke Skywalker had become a Jedi Master and a teacher, but then left it all behind, choosing self-imposed exile after a terrible tragedy in which his nephew chose the dark side and killed fellow students, while recruiting others to become his own Knights of Ren. Questions answered. Done and dusted. The Force Awakens also introduced three new characters in the form of Rey (a Force-sensitive scavenger who’s been left behind with no last name), Finn (a stormtrooper, so no name at all to begin with, just a number), and Poe Dameron (a Resistance pilot with a last name and a cocky Han Solo-esque attitude). And this is where the new questions started. Who are Rey’s parents? Why can she use the Force? Why is she so good at, well, everything? Why is Kylo Ren so immediately drawn to Rey? Okay, but really, who the hell is Rey and why is she such a big deal? More questions, this time about Kylo Ren. Leia Organa and Han Solo gave birth to a son named Ben Solo. Ben Solo became Kylo Ren. Why? This epic bad guy named Supreme Leader Snoke. Who’s Snoke? Why is Ben looking for Luke Skywalker? Why does he hate his uncle? Why does he feel a connection to Rey? So many questions. Oh, and a cliffhanger. Because, hey, why not? J.J. Abrams was only hired to do the first of the three movies in the trilogy, so his job was to create a movie that answered some questions, set up new questions, laid out a plot, and get everyone in position for the next guy in the relay to pick up the baton. Then The Last Jedi happened, which The Rise of Skywalker mostly ignores, save for a few plot points (Luke’s and Snoke’s deaths, Kylo’s new status, Rose, and the Force connection between Rey and Kylo). In fact, Rise of Skywalker ignores Last Jedi so much that we get a whole new lightsaber handoff. In essence, J.J. Abrams takes the baton from himself and then proceeds to answer all the questions he, himself, set up in The Force Awakens. All of them. And some of them repeatedly, just to make sure you didn’t miss it the first time. Or the second. Or even the third. When I walked out of The Rise of Skywalker, one of the people I spoke to said he really enjoyed the movie because it answered so many questions for him.  And maybe that’s exactly what the film is meant to do. We’ve heard fandom complaints about unanswered questions and plot holes for years now. If you don’t feel those issues have been handled after seeing this film, I honestly don’t know what to tell you. One of the other big talking points in the lead up to The Rise of Skywalker was the amount of time the new trio spends together — It’s apparent in trailers, and the film definitely delivers.  The new trio have more time together than they do in any of the previous films, including what we saw amongst the old trio in the original trilogy. Poe and Finn, Finn and Rey, Poe and Rey, Rey, Finn, and Poe, they’re all together and there’s lots of dialogue between them. Lots of banter. Lots. Personally, I could have done with a little less of it, but I’m one of those people who likes my banter old school. In doses and short bursts. YMMV. It’s not bad. It’s even fun. But there were times it felt… pushed. The film is beautiful to look at. The cinematography, especially in the sweeping outdoor desert world our characters travel to, is gorgeous. The special effects in this film are an achievement worthy of both praise and awards. The lightsaber fights are amazing. Both Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are at the top of their game, and the fight choreographers and stunt team really deserve so much praise for the skill and complexity of each fight. The performances are all top-notch. Ridley and Driver are challenged harder than ever and deliver beautifully. Oscar Issac is clearly having a blast. John Boyega is as passionate as ever. Richard E. Grant is evil personified, and Anthony Daniels gives what I think is his best performance of all nine films. In the end, The Rise of Skywalker delivers on what it’s supposed to be –– a Star Wars film. The end of a nine-film saga that’s touched the hearts of generations for decades and will inspire others for decades to come.  It’s the culmination of a story that began as an idea in a young director’s mind and has grown into a cultural phenomenon that’s inspired so many creative people to create their own movies, their own stories, their own dreams. Whether it’ll be your favorite, or if it will fall lower down your list, will all depend on what Star Wars means to you and what it is you want from this series. That’s the beauty of Star Wars. It’s not one thing for everyone. For some, it’s a lifelong passion. For others, it’s a passing enjoyment. Each trilogy has its own passionate advocates and critics, as does every book, film and TV show. Over time, you’ll decide for yourself where this film falls in the overall picture and you’ll find the Star Wars that YOU love. The Skywalker saga may be at an end, but Star Wars will continue, and I’m still just as interested in what’s next as I’ve always been. By the way: There is one question I still don’t have answered and, honestly, I want to know the answer to it. At one point, Finn tries to tell Rey something. He doesn’t get to. It gets brought up again a few times but, y’know, in the end, I don’t think we ever heard what it was. If you’re looking for a new Percy Jackson podcast, look no further than Prophecy Radio, which will discuss all of Rick Riordan’s projects, new and old.

"Dec 18, 2019","Although the current run of films has struggled to live up to the mythic power of the original trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker comes pretty darn close, and effectively carries the collective weight of the entries that precede it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," J.J. Abrams seems to have a heart bigger than his film budgets. From his earliest creations in television, with Keri Russell-led Felicity and groundbreaking phenomenon Lost, Abrams seems to understand the importance of human connection. But if you thought Felicity was about Team Ben or Team Noel or if Lost was about a polar bear, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is not for you. Rather, Episode IX of the mega-franchise is for the ones who understand deeper meanings of storytelling, an epic adventure that concludes a three-part saga, 42 years in the making.  While his name will most likely be read aloud for Best Actor at the 92nd Academy Awards in February 2020 for his work in Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, Adam Driver wins December with his portrayal of Kylo Ren, an embodiment of a tortured villain whose mission it is to find and destroy nemesis Rey (Daisy Ridley). Together, the equally-compelling Driver and Ridley lead the cast of familiar faces aboard the Millennium Falcon: a comically-gifted Oscar Isaac as Poe and John Boyega as Finn, alongside the legacy cast Billy Dee Williams as Lando and Anthony Daniels as C-3PO (Joonas Suotamo takes over the role of Chewbacca from the late Peter Mayhew). But most importantly, through the magic of technology and unused footage from previous films, Abrams pays an emotional tribute to Princess Leia and the late Carrie Fisher (with daughter Billie Lourd in close proximity). Although Fisher passed away two years ago, her presence and actual “legacy” are felt throughout, buoyed by Ridley’s poignant portrayal of the last Jedi. At a refreshing two hours and 22 minutes, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (along with the long IMDb list of editors) keep viewers at constant attention with a triple axel of character development, visual effects and an occasional breather for a laugh; purposefully similar to George Lucas’ vision four decades ago.  While Walt Disney Studios has kept the film and its many components highly guarded out of fear of spoilers, the themes in The Rise of Skywalker are nothing new. To the contrary, they are some of the oldest themes you can find in written word: friendship, hope, resilience, redemption. This years-in-the-making conclusion would have made millions at the box office with or without a thoughtful story, but the fact that it goes the extra effort to mean more than its “spoilers” makes it all the more special. Also worth noting that the film’s second unit director, Victoria Mahoney, is the first woman to helm a Star Wars film.  Marketed perfectly for a holiday season opening, theaters will be filled with friends, family or friends who feel like family – a mirror of what this story celebrates. Before people weigh in with 280 characters on Twitter about the plot holes or how dissatisfied they are with this ending (and they shouldn’t be) I would suggest looking around at the faces in the theater when the opening titles appear on the screen, when the Star Wars theme blares from surround sound speakers, when the simple, blue font welcomes us back to a galaxy far, far away. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," This is it. The end of the Skywalker Saga. Not the end of Star Wars – there’s plenty more of that to come. But this is it for the story that began with a princess sending a plea for help across the stars. This is the final outing for new trilogy leads Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), as the three of them band together in one last bid to stop both the First Order, led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), and the resurgent Sith, rallying around returning franchise villain Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Where The Last Jedi saw the core three separated across different adventures, The Rise Of Skywalker is firmly – overtly – about teamwork. Those three, plus Chewie, C-3PO, BB-8 and the whole crew, all have their part to play in this film’s galaxy-hopping quest. The various team-ups, with old friends as well as new faces bring some bounce and humour to proceedings, with Isaac in particular proving himself once again to be one of the most charismatic and under-used action heroes in Hollywood. His chemistry with Boyega is a highlight of the film. Ridley’s Rey fits in nicely with the team, and there’s an energy between them all that’s been missing since the original trilogy. This is Ridley’s strongest film to date. Rey might not be 100% sure of who she is yet, but Ridley has her sussed, and turns in a compassionate, emotional, and physically impressive performance, holding her own against Driver both in dramatic scenes and their painful knock-down fights. The rest of the cast all turn in good – if small – performances. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose has been unfairly demoted to little more than a background Rebel, while Keri Russell does sassy work from behind a very cool mask, and Naomi Ackie’s Jannah is little more than a foil for Finn. Richard E Grant has fun as a paint-by-numbers baddie, and Billy Dee Williams’ returning Lando has minimal impact on the plot. Carrie Fisher’s scenes are touchingly clumsy, but Abrams and co find a way to do her justice. As the previous paragraph indicates, this is a crowded film, eager to give us all the new planets fans love while also throwing dozens of characters at the screen. Many are left underserved, including Finn, who has no motivation beyond being worried about Rey. The only thing the film spends any real time on is continuing to develop the light vs dark struggle between Rey and Kylo, with both of their souls hanging in the balance. The Last Jedi made some bold choices, and divided fans as a result. This instalment clearly aims to wrap the trilogy up on a crowd-pleasing note, and certainly delivers some cheers and gasps. However, in aiming to please everyone it ends up surprising no-one. Twists are heavily signposted, and some panicked course-correction makes it feel at times as though it’s going backwards rather than forwards. It also feels a bit disjointed, with some story strands getting lost along the way, and others being rushed through. The action sequences are thrilling, but there’s nothing to match the visual spectacle of The Last Jedi’s red-splashed battle on Crait. That said, The Rise Of Skywalker does some truly delightful work with puppets and prosthetics in bringing its aliens to life, rather than relying too much on CGI. This world feels touchable, and is all the better for it.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Todo comienza, por supuesto, con los inconfundibles acordes del gran John Williams, la frase ""Hace mucho tiempo en una galaxia muy, muy lejana"" y el rodante con enormes letras amarillas que nos explica el contexto de la historia. Un ritual que se inició hace 42 años y que con esta novena entrega llega a su fin. Imposible entonces no ponerse algo solemne y bastante nostálgico con una saga que marcó a varias generaciones de cinéfilos y generó un negocio multimillonario que incluye infinidad de spin-offs, producciones animadas, nuevas series como The Mandalorian y merchandising de todo tipo. Con J.J. Abrams nuevamente en el guion y la dirección (ya había rodado el Episodio VII, titulado El despertar de la fuerza), y luego de un octavo film (Los últimos Jedi) que, con Rian Johnson al frente, decepcionó a buena parte de los fans, El ascenso de Skywalker resulta un cierre acorde con los deseos de todos: convincente, impecable, cristalino, contundente, eficaz. Pero, al mismo tiempo, parece tan diseñado, tan subrayado, tan calculado, incluso por momentos tan demagógico, que se extraña una dosis mayor de audacia. Una película que ya es parte de la historia grande del cine por darle cierre a una de las sagas más populares del planeta, pero que está lejos de hacer historia por sus atributos estrictamente artísticos. Dicho de otro modo, es casi imposible no conmoverse con ciertas escenas, ante determinadas revelaciones, con los diversos desenlaces que se producen en los últimos minutos, pero en muchos casos esa emoción surge a partir de cuestiones más simbólicas o afectivas que cinematográficas. Sin entrar en detalles (spoilers) que puedan enturbiar la experiencia más gozosa, puede decirse que Rey (Daisy Riley) es ahora sí la auténtica protagonista de esta entrega final. Más allá de la permanente tensión entre ella y el Kylo Ren de Adam Driver (que incluye conexiones a distancia, duelos con sables de luz, una contradictoria relación de amor-odio y la tentación que comparten a la hora de acercarse al lado oscuro de la fuerza), es Rey quien carga con el peso dramático del relato para convertirse en una heroína moderna. Sí, hasta la clásica Star Wars se adaptó a las exigencias de estos tiempos. Como quedó dicho, El ascenso de Skywalker tiene un poco de todo: algunos momentos de heroísmo y humor con los personajes de Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) y Lando Calrissian (el veterano Billy Dee Williams), la presencia de los queribles robots (R2-D2, C-3PO, BB-8 y hasta alguna flamante incorporación), los aportes menores pero decisivos de dos mitos como Leia Organa (se reciclaron y adaptaron viejas tomas hechas con Carrie Fisher) y Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), alguna que otra sorpresa como muertos que reaparecen en escena a partir de visiones trascendentales, ciencias oscuras o clonaciones, y las vueltas de tuerca finales que permiten cerrar todos los círculos y que los distintos viajes internos y externos se resuelvan de manera satisfactoria. Así, sin demasiado riesgo ni sofisticación, pero con indudable solvencia y profesionalismo, puede decirse que J.J. Abrams llega a la meta sorteando todos los obstáculos y las presiones en tiempo y forma. Misión cumplida. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Perhaps the best in-movie self-criticism is in the fact that Kylo Ren rebuilds his destroyed mask. Some fans of the series believe that “The Last Jedi” destroyed their favorite franchise, and here’s J.J. Abrams literally picking up the broken pieces and putting them back together. And yet, as he's told, you can still see the cracks, meant as a criticism of Kylo's uncertainty but reflective of the movie too. Sometimes you can’t just put things back together, and revisit history in a way that doesn’t feel craven and desperate.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker ends more than a franchise. It ends an era. Yes, we have The Mandalorian, and I love Baby Yoda (okay, The Child) with my entire heart, but this is bigger. A New Hope is my first conscious movie memory. Star Wars has literally changed my entire life and charted the course of my career.  I say this because, in the time it took for me to tweet my initial reaction to the film to get down the stairs of the theater, I had a ton of angry reactions. Star Wars is a divisive fandom these days, very much split between love and hate. There are a ton of reasons for this, some from the Light side of the Force, some from the Dark, but there it is. I loved the film, so if you’re ready to argue with me before you see it, at least know that going in. What I’m about to tell you is as spoiler-free as I can make it, and I recommend that you see this fast and stay off social media until you do. The entire movie is a spoiler, and I want you to gasp and cheer and cry like I did. Or yell at the screen if that’s how you feel. Here’s what I can say as a setup. We find our Resistance friends shortly after we last saw them in The Last Jedi. They’ve reorganized and are still fighting the good fight. Rey is dealing (as we see in the trailer) with her Jedi training, and things are about to go south. We’re meeting new characters and revisiting old ones. However, there are a number of things from The Last Jedi that don’t get wrapped up, like the child at the end of the film.  Make of that what you will. I enjoyed The Last Jedi, though I had some problems with it. I fall on the positive reaction side if that helps you sort this all out. I don’t think you’ll find that The Rise of Skywalker is disrespectful to that film in any way (more on that later), but it is absolutely its own thing. In case you’re wondering about the humor (something that was very divisive in the last film), it’s there in small bursts, but the tone here is different. The Resistance is desperate. The stakes are higher than they’ve ever been. You know, when you blow up Death Stars as a matter of course, it’s hard to raise the bar. How do you make the threat bigger? Well, J.J. Abrams managed it. This feels far more dangerous than it has in the last two films. Every living thing in the universe is in peril, and it doesn’t feel like, ooh, bring on the CGI.  The most frightening thing in the film takes place on both a large scale and a personal one. Do you remember the moment in A New Hope when they make a run on the Death Star, and everyone is dying around Luke? That’s the feeling I got here when the final moments of the battle raged. (And oh my gosh, that scene! Do you want to praise some CGI? You will here.) That desperation. That edge of your seat, gripping the armrests, is sort of desperation. I mean, the Light side has to win, doesn’t it? Will it? Who will we lose? As a lifelong Star Wars fan, I thought I knew, in a vague way, what was coming in this film, but no matter what you know, there are a large number of gasp-worthy moments in this film. That’s why I’m telling you to stay off of social media. There are big ones here, though one of them happens very quickly and could have taken a bit more time to breathe. You’ll know which one when you see it. There are also heart-wrenching moments, cameos, and one moment so joyful that you will find yourself holding your breath so you don’t cry. One small thing, and though this isn’t really a spoiler, it does address a recent comment from J.J. Abrams, so skip the next paragraph if you don’t want to know. We all mourned the passing of Carrie Fisher back in 2016. We all know that footage of Carrie from previous films would be used to make sure General Leia Organa was in the story. It was well done. Yes, you can tell at moments from what she’s saying that she wasn’t there, but I think in this instance, it’s okay. This isn’t a normal film, where we don’t know about the actors’ lives. This is a part of the culture. We know Carrie is gone and that they’re using scraps.  We can accept what they’ve done and how they made this work. Though I’d give anything to have seen what they would have done if she was still here, we get a satisfying and beautiful ending to the story of one of our favorite characters. It hurts to think about what could have been, but Abrams did his best with what he had, and it works. Rey’s journey comes absolutely full circle in The Rise of Skywalker. So does the story of Kylo Ren. Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver absolutely kill it here. It’s a powerful arc for both of them, with twists I did not expect. We get answers about Rey, and they’re not vague. For some, this might be a bit neat and forced. For me, it made total sense. Poe’s (Oscar Isaac) and Finn’s (John Boyega) stories are wonderful as well, though not as wrapped up.  Sadly, Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) does get less screen time than I’d hoped for. I’d say that’s my biggest issue with the film. We’re introducing a lot of new characters here, and though I love them, it does take away from one many of us have come to love. That is the place where I can agree with some criticisms of the movement from The Last Jedi to The Rise of Skywalker. We set Rose up as a main character, and her story doesn’t have much weight. It happens with some of the new characters as well, though their arcs are more satisfying. Zori Bliss (Kerri Russell) isn’t on screen for that long, but you really get a sense of who she is and what she stands for. I would be shocked if we don’t see her pop up somewhere in the future of the Star Wars universe. Jannah (Naomi Ackie) is another wonderful addition, but I want to know so much more about her. Believe me, you’ll understand why when the film comes out. In a more complete arc, Lando Calrissian’s (Billy Dee Williams) appearance will have even the most cynical Star Wars fans cheering. I can’t miss mentioning two new characters that had me grinning. I do sometimes get a little annoyed when things get too cutesy, but I had absolutely the opposite reaction to the new droid Dio and the little droid smith Babu Frick. While they’re not quite at Baby Yoda’s level, they’re going to be fan favorites. As far as what gets wrapped up, well, that’s interesting. We know that this is the end of the Skywalker saga, and it feels like it. That said, there are a number of side stories, and even the future of the main one, that feel like they could be expanded. I fully expect novelizations about certain new characters and the future of our heroes to appear fairly quickly. Frankly, I’d love to read them. There is only so much you can take on in a single film, and introducing this many stories is bound to make you curious about where things could go. Overall, this film is satisfying. It was the first word I thought of when I left the theater. As someone who has spent most of my life loving this franchise, with a career that has often been based around it, I left happy. I can quibble with small things, and I do think cutting some stories short was a misstep, I felt like… well, I felt like I had my old Star Wars back. Not that I don’t love the other two new films. (I did not like the prequels, though I’m not judging you if you did.) It’s all part of a larger universe that has been a part of me. Still, there was something so — again — satisfying about the first trilogy.  It ended, and I felt good about it. (I was the right age for Ewoks. Fight me.) I feel good here as well. I left the theater smiling, mulling over how my heroes had ended up, how they had fought for the Light, and how they had become family. Look, many of you are going to decide to hate or love this film before you see it. That’s been very clear on Twitter. For me, I’m happy to report that I loved it, that my beloved Leia got an end to her story, and that I left feeling at peace with the ending. P.S.

"Dec 18, 2019"," (Image courtesy Lucasfilm Ltd. / Disney) Rey (Daisy Ridley) runs from an approaching TIE fighter in a scene from ""Star Wars, Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker,"" which will be released in theaters Dec. 20, 2019. Where a “Star Wars” fan lands regarding “The Rise of Skywalker” — the ninth and (supposedly) final chapter of the story that began back in 1977 — will depend largely on where the fan started the journey. Younger viewers, the ones whose memories of young Luke Skywalker battling Darth Vader and destroying the Death Star played out on the small screen, likely will be satisfied with where director J.J. Abrams brings back the narrative that he started with “The Force Awakens” in 2015. The old guard like me, who thrilled to Luke and Leia and Han decades ago in the movie theaters, may be struck with a sense of “been there, blasted that.” All generations of fans will find a lot to love — it is a “Star Wars” movie, after all — with plenty of action, moving moments for our main heroes, some callbacks that don’t feel like pandering, and a finale that ties up 42 years of Skywalker lore with only a few loose ends. (Gotta leave something for a sequel.) For a lively franchise that puts young heroes front and center, this installment begins with a concentration on the dead coming back to speak. A transmission from Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who we thought was killed in “Return of the Jedi,” sails across the cosmos, warning of a resurrection of the Sith and the end of the Resistance. That Resistance is still led by General Leia Organa — played by Carrie Fisher, gone three years this month, through unused footage from the last two films — who is training Rey (Daisy Ridley), formerly her brother Luke’s protege, in the ways of the Force. Elsewhere, our heroes Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) are bouncing among planets in the Millennium Falcon, collecting intel from a spy Leia has cultivated within the First Order. Hot on the Falcon’s trail is Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who worries Palpatine’s resurfacing will threaten his hold on power after the death of Supreme Commander Snoke in the previous film, “The Last Jedi.” OK, that’s as far into spoiler territory I’m interested in going — in fact, there’s little in the above synopsis that isn’t mentioned in the trademark yellow-type crawl that accompanies John Williams’ famous fanfare. (Yes, he came out of retirement to write the score to this one, and shows up in an onscreen cameo — one of many familiar faces Abrams gets before the cameras.) Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio jam so much action into the first hour there’s scarcely time for the audience to breathe, or for the late-to-the-game new characters to make an impact. Such a frenzied pace is a problem in a movie that ultimately hangs on the quiet philosophical questions that “Star Wars” has asked since George Lucas started the franchise: Are we all good? Or all evil? And is it fate or will that determines which way we go? Abrams steers away from the fascinating path writer-director Rian Johnson took in “The Last Jedi,” which suggested there’s a little bit of the Force in everybody. Here, Abrams returns to the safer route, with concerns of lineage and legacy, whether one’s family name is Skywalker or Palpatine. If the Force is all in the blood, maybe it is all up to the number of midichlorians a person has in their veins, like Lucas said in “The Phantom Menace” — and that’s not, as Old Ben Kenobi once said, taking a step into a larger universe. Those may be minor quibbles — but minor quibbles, fought one Twitter rant at a time, are what keep “Star Wars” fans energized. Those fans will find more to like about “The Rise of Skywalker” than dislike, and even in its faults there lies the joy of flying through a familiar universe one last time. Our heroes in a galaxy far, far away fight for good over evil one more time, in a concluding chapter that’s satisfying if a bit safe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," While the nature of making a final entry in a trilogy means approaching a somewhat predictable resolution to a story, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker was in an excellent position to deliver something unique. The Last Jedi set out to evolve the franchise, doing what it could to break the mold and push the series into territory outside of what was expected for a Star Wars film. Ideally, returning director J.J. Abrams would run with what writer/director Rian Johnson had handed off. He could further push the limits of what audiences could see in a Star Wars movie, while still nailing the genuine entertainment and wonder this saga has managed to offer up for over 40 years. Alas, it was not to be. While elements certainly shine, surprisingly poor storytelling really hurts what could have been a grand finale. Set a year after the events of The Last Jedi, this entry finds Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) working together on a series of team-based missions, in hopes of completing a quest, defeating the main boss, and saving the galaxy. That’s really what it comes down to, along with a few side-missions to introduce new planets and characters, lots of exposition to fill in some newly introduced concepts, and a whole slew of references to presumably satisfy or pacify anyone who’s ever watched a Star Wars movie (though prequel fans are still going to have little to grasp onto). It’s not as though other films from this series haven’t trafficked in the same ideas before. I come to Star Wars to see likable characters engage in blaster shootouts and lightsaber battles when they’re not exploring new planets and letting the world-building show off a wide variety of imaginative designs. The problem comes from the script by Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio. While the story makes a level of sense, in delivering on it, the frantically-paced film relies heavily on rapid-fire dialogue to go over various MacGuffins and simplified plotting, leading to everyone skipping around to different set pieces. The results somehow build to a needlessly convoluted film. Understandably, there’s a sense of urgency that’s essential to the plot. And yet, even with the entire galaxy being threatened with the latest version of a world killer, the stakes never felt as extreme as they should. Without digging too far into how and why, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) factors into this final entry of the Skywalker saga, and given what’s being intended by him and the evil First Order, the conflict presented should mean as much to me as it does the characters. Unfortunately, while their best efforts may or may not have inevitable results, I can’t say there was much of an overwhelming reaction with how it plays out. Perhaps it’s wiser to look at things from a more personal level. While there was fun to be had in watching the return of Han, Luke, and Leia at various stages of this sequel trilogy, The Force Awakens did accomplish a lot in establishing its new younger set of characters. They, fortunately, turn out to be some of the biggest highlights in The Rise of Skywalker. The strong friendship between these three pays off well as far as having fun early on, as they bounce around on their various missions. One sequence, in particular, allows for a neat excursion to an alien-filled music festival, that’s followed by an inventive speeder chase. Getting back to the characters, though, Finn and Poe have essentially completed their character arcs at this point, yet there’s some time allowing them to further expand on what made them break out for fans. However, Abrams wisely puts the most focus on Rey’s journey, which comes as a balance to the dastardly Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Despite misgivings I have with certain developments that feel designed to either answer questions we didn’t need answers to or provide greater emphasis on ideas best left as observable details, Ridley puts her all into the lead performance. With so much speculation in regards to the mystery of her character, this is a film with answers. More importantly, it speaks to what Rey has learned in the time since audiences were first introduced to her, to her training with Luke, to the ultimate realizations she has this time around. Similarly, Kylo Ren must also contend with what it means to have so much power and use it for the sake of feeding his dark side. The benefit is getting to see an escalation in the tension between him and Rey. It allows for further exploration of the force, in addition to neat excuses for watching elaborate action sequences play out. I only wish they left an impact as strong as some previous lightsaber battles, let alone show emotional confidence in how these fights impact the story. There is something to be said for the level of investment that speaks to how one takes in this series. I suppose a lot of fans will be satisfied with the callbacks, payoffs to certain journeys, and the sense of finality delivered for many of the characters, including Leia (who appears thanks to unreleased Force Awakens footage and the magic of special effects). My problem comes from what seems to be evident with Abrams as a director – there’s a hollowness to his films. While sometimes able to mask it with enough flash on-screen and enough chemistry between the actors, his handling on this film seems to highlight a lack of much regard for making a movie relying on nothing but Star Wars as a guide. A major positive for The Last Jedi was how Johnson put the Kurosawa back in Star Wars, by which I mean his film seemed to be guided by not only what works for the series, but how George Lucas had initially looked at these films as a platform to incorporate all he loved about the movies he grew up watching. With The Rise of Skywalker, I don’t see much reverence or interest for anything other than settling the audience down with what’s come before in these films. It means the movie is ultimately about very little, even if some characters end up having a stronger purpose than others. Still, this is Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker, meaning a massive film like this knows how to get a lot of things right. In addition to the genuinely winning cast, which adds on Keri Russell, Dominic Monaghan, Naomi Ackie, and Richard E. Grant for good measure, and also brings back Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the movie is packed with spectacular visuals and conceptually exciting developments. The Force-based astral projection from The Last Jedi returns, allowing for multiple ways to build into new action scenes. Practical alien and droid designs are taken to new extremes. And I am always into seeing what kinds of new worlds these films choose to deliver. With such a minimal amount of actual plot (even though characters are continually explaining things), there’s a looseness to the film that at least helps The Rise of Skywalker hold onto a sense of fun. After moving in a comparatively darker direction last time around, I suppose the latest move towards team-focused space adventure-ing is a fitting way to balance everything. That said, the depiction of Palpatine ends up feeling like an old school movie monster, the closest Abrams gets to venturing towards referencing other films, thanks to horror movie makeup, and other concepts seemingly lifted from Fritz Lang’s Metropolis. In saying all of this (and I still feel like I’m merely scratching the surface), there’s no doubt a sense of tremendous responsibility when being handed the opportunity to put together a saga-ending chapter for the most significant blockbuster movie franchise ever. The fact that it’s underwhelming is not the best result. It’s why it’s a challenge to grapple with all the ways this film works, even though it often feels like an ill-advised rebuke to what made the previous entry so much more fascinating. Even when factoring in the eagerness to see the film and put together this critique, I still wonder if any issues and misgivings I have will fade over time. That in mind, even when things felt unbalanced, I saw the light and goodness coming out of the more experimental films in this series. As it stands, The Rise of Skywalker feels more like giving in to desires that push it closer to the dark side than many would ultimately want. If this is the end (for now), I appreciate the attempt but would have liked Star Wars to truly become one with the force.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," If the last twenty years and five films have taught us anything about Star Wars fans, it’s one blindingly obvious fact; you cannot please them all. Serve up too many elements of the films that came before and you’re derided for lazily recycling the past. Stray too far away from the tried and true formula and you’re vilified for destroying the franchise. There really is no way to win everyone over, particularly with how sacred many rightly hold the original trilogy. In 2015, co-writer/director J.J Abrams was criticised by some for The Force Awakens feeling too familiar to the plot and structure of the original Star Wars. In 2017, the pitchforks came out for writer/director Rian Johnson after a collection of very vocal fans (just because a group is loud doesn’t make it the majority) found his edgy, daring, and divisive The Last Jedi meddled too heavily with their treasured saga. See. You just can’t win. Now we arrive at The Rise of Skywalker, the concluding chapter of Disney’s colossal sequel trilogy and (apparently) the finale of the entire Skywalker saga. After juggling through a few writers and directors (sorry, Colin Trevorrow), Abrams returns to the director’s chair to bring this incarnation of the franchise to a close with a messy, yet somewhat satisfying conclusion that’s sure to spark plenty of furious debate. And may God help us all. It’s difficult to summarise the plot details of this third chapter without someone instantly crying spoilers. Even revealing the colour of a character’s shoes will likely devastate someone, so let’s try to keep this brief and as spoiler-free as possible. If you’d prefer to know literally nothing of this film than what has been unveiled in the trailers, maybe skip the next few paragraphs. You have been warned. Somewhere out in space, the voice of long-thought dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has returned (this shouldn’t come as a surprise, given he’s in the trailer and on the poster), transmitting a message that attracts the attention of Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who sets out to find and destroy the former leader of the Galactic Empire. This guy does not easily suffer challengers to his throne as the head villain of this trilogy. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her Jedi training, now under the tutelage of General Leia Organa (the late, great Carrie Fisher). After an unknown First Order spy informs Leia of the Emperor’s secretive plan to return from the grave with an arsenal of starships, Rey, Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and Chewbacca set off in the Millennium Falcon on a voyage to save the galaxy for one last time. That’s really all one can say without venturing too deeply into spoiler territory. But, with a two-and-a-half-hour running time, you can imagine there’s plenty more going down in this bombastic space opera, including the introduction of a few new characters who mostly register little impact. Or, more accurately, aren’t given a whole lot to do by Abrams and Chris Terrio‘s screenplay, which labours most of the new cast with the thankless task of spouting nothing but constant exposition. It’s that very screenplay that proves to be one of the biggest flaws of The Rise of Skywalker, as it foolishly attempts to cram a potentially three-and-a-half-hour-long epic into just 141 minutes. After the ridiculous success of Avengers: Endgame, it’s rather baffling anyone thought Star Wars fans couldn’t handle/didn’t deserve an equally-long concluding chapter. This is the final film of a nine-part series that spans over four decades. Why exactly are we rushing through this? This is particularly troublesome in the film’s first hour where our band of heroes zoom off on a neverending McGuffin hunt, as they attempt to track down one mystical doodad after another on some previously unseen planet in their hopes of eventually locating Palpatine. A pyramid-shaped trinket. A Sith dagger. Poe’s ex-girlfriend. Two turtle doves. And a partridge in a pear tree. Abrams barrels through this scavenger hunt with such ridiculous speed, it’s hard to keep up with what thing they’re trying to find to get to the next place to locate the other thing that’s the key to unlocking the previous thing. It’s not that this first act is particularly dull or lifeless. It’s always fun to journey to new lands within the Star Wars galaxy. And, ultimately, these discoveries each offers something to the overall narrative, with a few of those doodads coming into play again later in the film. It’s just the pacing is so unnervingly fast and each mystery is solved remarkably easily, making the entire pointless trek seem like nothing more than an attempt to draw out the inevitable showdown. After setting up this franchise five years ago, Abrams has the unenviable task of returning to follow up a film he had no hand in. While several key elements established by Johnson in The Last Jedi remain, namely Kylo and Rey’s psychic connection, he tosses a hefty chunk of Johnson’s work right out the window. Kylo rebuilds the helmet he destroyed in the previous film with spiffy new fluorescent red lines. A key player in the predecessor, Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) is relegated to little more than a background character. And as for the ever-burning question regarding Rey’s lineage, well, you’ll just have to see the abrupt direction Abrams takes on that one. One can’t help but wonder if these three films were keenly mapped out before production even began or if they’ve just been making it all up as they go along. Two directors working on three connecting films probably wasn’t the wisest idea, and it’s hard to say this trilogy flows organically from one to the next. It will be curious to learn if future generations find the experience of watching these three films somewhat jarring. It’s inescapable the vision Abrams had for this trilogy that Johnson somewhat ignored. It’s still rather wild Disney even allowed it to occur. In some ways, The Rise of Skywalker feels almost like a soft reboot. Some will deem that entirely necessary. Some will find the idea wildly offensive. That being said, if you loved Abrams’ nostalgia vibes in The Force Awakens, this final film will absolutely be your cup of tea. Echoing the rousing finale of the Avengers series, The Rise of Skywalker is supreme fan service, overloaded with franchise references and returning characters (it’s a joy to have Billy Dee Williams back as Lando Calrissian) to put a huge smile on the face of Star Wars fans. Is it all a little too much? Does it fall back on nostalgia too heavily? Perhaps, but if you’ve been with this franchise for 40 years, this film is speaking to you. There are certain boxes a Star Wars film must tick, and this one ticks them all. Much has been made of the inclusion of Fisher, given her untimely death pre-dated production of this film. Working with cut elements from previously filmed scenes, Abrams tries his best to seamlessly insert Leia in an important yet minimal way. It doesn’t always work and it’s hard not to notice how her “performance” has been stitched together in post-production. Regardless, it’s glorious to have Fisher play some part in the finale of the saga that made her a star. The problem with Abrams’ safe style is his frustrating inability to take true risks. There are numerous times in The Rise of Skywalker where the director dabbles with something genuinely bold, particularly some wildly unexpected narrative moments, but doesn’t have the nerve to see it through. It’s a cavalcade of shocks that seemingly spin the story on its head, only to shyly back away from truly going for it. Again, it’s hard to discuss these events without spoilers, but one genuinely moving moment towards the film’s conclusion is completely undone by the director bluntly refusing to try something unexpected. As expected, The Rise of Skywalker is a spectacular looking film from a production standpoint. We know this franchise can deliver the spectacle, and Abrams offers plenty of dazzling set-pieces to keep an audience endlessly entertained. Supreme visual effects work by the team at Industrial Light & Magic and stunning production design from Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins are complemented by Dan Mindel‘s absorbing cinematography, creating some genuinely stunning imagery. And, in a bittersweet adieu, John Williams provides a stirring, turbulent, and resonant score for the final time, inserting several of his beloved Star Wars pieces into a wholly new work that will surely see the composer receive his 52nd (!) Oscar nomination. It’s undeniable Abrams loves the Star Wars franchise and has crafted a conclusion aimed squarely at his fellow fans. He knows precisely how to tug at your heartstrings and there are numerous moments here that will have you reaching for the tissues. It’s the finale we possibly needed but perhaps not the one we hoped for. It fails to take the risks it could have, but it still offers a gratifying and sentimental farewell. This may not be the supreme conclusion some were anticipating but nowhere near the disaster it might have been. As a devoted fan of this franchise since the age of 5, The Rise of Skywalker still provided this film critic with endless joy, even if the final product felt a little too safe and familiar. I laughed. I cried. I cheered. I gasped. I thanked my lucky stars I’ve been alive to witness one of cinema’s greatest ever sagas. Thanks for the memories, Star Wars. And may the force be with you. Always.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," “The Dead speak!” declares the first sentence of the receding letters on the opening scroll of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Some spoilers: Some major characters from the ‘70s/’80s first trilogy – Episodes IV, V and VI - are indeed resurrected in various ways in the new movie.  That group includes the late Carrie Fisher who appears (thanks to left-over footage and movie magic) as General Leia Organa, the trainer of protagonist Rey (Daisy Ridley), heroine of the current sequel trilogy. Her role requires her to be the bearer of sententious Jedi-esque commands like: “Don’t tell me what things look like. Tell me what they are.” A couple and a half hours later, after a much-needed bathroom break, I thought: “They sure got their money’s worth from the multiple plays of John Williams’ theme music.” Like most reviewers of a certain age, I have a fond 42-year-old memory of seeing the original Star Wars. But the truth is, I thought it was kitsch for kids. My fondest Star Wars-linked memory is Bill Murray, on Saturday Night Live, as ski-lodge lounge-singer Nick Winters, crooning:  “Star Wars … nothing but Star Wars, Give me those Star Wars … don’t let them end.” Director J.J. Abrams  revived Star Wars with 2015’s The Force Awakens before handing the reins to Rian Johnson for The Last Jedi, the latter of which was a critical and box office success (in spite some nasty fan blowback against its racial and gender advances). Abrams is always impressively competent in plot traffic control, sifting exposition and action with bearable amounts of Spielbergian sentimentality and visual excellence (cinematography is by Dan Mindel, production design by Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins).  Yet, with another billion dollar box office movie on the line, it feels as though Abrams plays things safe, finding ways to wind up loose ends, mollifying the fan base and  going for the tie rather than the win.  Often, it’s easy to get lost as to which spectacular planet we’re supposed to be on (desert, verdant, glacial?) and why. Characters fight against specular backdrops – the stormy sea one is most impressive. They occasionally stop to catch their breaths while delivering swaths of exposition, with the occasional interlude with a cute baby animal or weird franken-beast (horses with big tusks!) Daisy Ridley mostly looks determined, while Oscar Isaac, as the roguish pilot Poe Dameron, offers a pale echo of Harrison Ford’s Hans Solo sassiness. Otherwise, Adam Driver, as the brooding, fretful Kylo Ren, embodies the philosophical theme of divided dark-and-light nature, in a way that seems a bit too explicit. The Star Wars saga can hold profound meaning in real lives. Not long ago, I attended a funeral for a friend, where George Lucas’ Jedi maxims were invoked. But the Jedi code against fear doesn’t feel compatible with the final episode’s caution. Instead, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker dodges complications like a Jedi star-fighter threading through an asteroid belt, delivering a one-size-fits-all “believe in yourself” message, and a generic celebration of political defiance/invasion resistance and melodramatic sacrifice.  Like the Marvel Universe, Star Wars is about conflicts and characters shielded in the armour of franchise logic, where defeat and even death are somehow temporary. To quote Bill Murray’s song again, “Star Wars/ those near and far wars” checks the boxes of a lot of the audience’s base, while seeming unburdened by real gravity.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," As Star Wars concludes Luke Skywalker’s historic Lucasfilm storyline (for now), Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker confirms an odd trilogy takeaway: these three chapters do not play well together. J.J. Abrams once again embraces his safety netted desire to retrofit “new” explorations of galaxies far, far away around rehashed nostalgia frameworks. Where Rian Johnson challenged audiences in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Abrams retcons and cameos his way into a fan-servicing whirlwind that mistakes copious callbacks with having an identity. It’s still an expansive sci-fi blockbuster with intergalactic dogfights, space cowboy resilience, and fights against oppression, but I’m left feeling the same kind of brand-recognition entertainment much like Star Wars: The Force Awakens. This is going to be a challenging spoiler-free review given how ninety-nine percent of The Rise Of Skywalker is spoilers, so plot recapping will remain scant. The Resistance is scrambling under Leia Organa’s (Carrie Fisher) command, Rey (Daisy Ridley) must protect the Jedi Order from extinction, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) only has eyes for universal domination. Everyone’s back, too, from Finn (John Boyega) to Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o), Poe (Oscar Isaac) to Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Are reports of Emperor Palpatine’s survival true? Has the Resistance lost all its allies due to fear of the First Order’s power? HOW MANY DEATH STARS HAVE BEEN BUILT THIS TIME?! Most frustratingly, The Rise Of Skywalker relies on familiarity over risks. Character arcs devolve with furious whiplash thanks to bland-as-Banthas-droppings finishes. Abrams understands how legacy Star Wars characters mean everything to the fanbase and his manipulation of iconic faces and quotes recalls the words “cheap” or “cheating.” One character in particular, of the First Order, is mishandled with such glorious injustice that I’m ready to start my own “#JusticeForHan” (Fast & Furious) equivalent hashtag. Between Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio, so much time is spent scrambling to disassemble The Last Jedi that you can’t possibly squeeze an entire space opera into whatever’s left over. Even still, the dizzying amount of placation that sneakily strives to erase The Last Jedi is an issue no matter how unambitious. The Rise Of Skywalker was always going to be a team-up film uniting major players – Rey, Poe, Finn, Chewy – while others become background props. Kelly Marie Tran, for example, seems to have fewer lines as Rose Tico than sidekick pilot Snap Wexely (Greg Grunberg) or a new unnamed monitor reader played by Dominic Monaghan. That said, there’s still plenty of time to introduce a new droid with social anxiety (D-O), a romantic rival for Poe (Zorii Bliss played by Keri Russell), and Richard E. Grant as “Allegiant General Pryde” who embodies vile First Order sophistication. Abrams tries to “fix” Star Wars by tossing more and more ingredients into an already overspilling pot, hoping to punch up the flavor to levels that mask the incomprehensible madness still not mixing together. Yet, we’re talking about a Star Wars film backed by Disney-sized budgets. For every throwaway moment that fails to resonate with conveyed cinematic emotion, there’s a destroyed TIE Fighter or transformative Star Destroyer production design. I’ll admit, The Rise Of Skywalker learns from Johnson’s more “artistic” approach to Star Wars in how cinematographer Dan Mindel captures cosmic warfare. A particular battle that involves an endless fleet of First Order destroyers and energy beams zipping through the sky is a breathtaking sight, as well as some darkened horror elements. Wild beasts being ridden by Finn’s platoon, bounding across a Star Destroyer’s steel exoskeleton (don’t ask). Narratives may remain beyond clunky, but one can’t help but marvel at some of the interplanetary photography. Getting into action mindsets, nothing ever reaches the heights of Johnson’s “Red Room Battle” from The Last Jedi – but this is coming from someone who admittedly adored The Last Jedi. Take that comment how you will. You’ll get Poe’s flyboy blasting and plenty of lightspeed chases, but again, that creeping sense of “we’ve seen this before” can’t be shaken. Abrams delivers serviceable amounts of lightsaber duels that blend colors and go energy swords akimbo, and it’s never outright boring. I’m just left trying to connect all the conflicting subplots in my head like an old-timey switchboard operator while truly standout fight sequences escape recollection. Lasting impressions? Not here. The Rise Of Skywalker only delivers what Abrams believes Star Wars audiences want to see, nary original conceptualization. In the end, our generation’s Star Wars triumvirate (spinoffs not included) completes with a sloppy, overwhelming, maybe capable enough saga that’s more a continuation of Star Wars: The Force Awakens than anything. Even so, J.J. Abrams still tries to ape the most widely fan-appreciated aspects of The Last Jedi (a master robotics hacker creature is Abrams’ Porg, humor lands flat where Rian Johnson dished wit), yet jettisons so much else into a Sarlacc pit. Is it the ending audiences deserve? Not in my opinion. Is it one that’s palatable and easily digested? Without investing in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker past glancing blows of something meaningful, sure enough. Just don’t try and unravel that tangled ball of yarn that Abrams calls storytelling, because there’ll be no cleaning up such a futile Cat’s Cradle mess.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Like Revenge of the Sith almost a decade and a half ago, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker comes into theaters with a whole lot of plot seemingly left to go before the trilogy can end. The Force Awakens offered many questions; The Last Jedi cast aside many of them. And going into the alleged “final” chapter we still don’t even know basic stuff like where the First Order came from, or what Snoke’s deal was. While trying to spoil almost nothing for our readers, I can say this: questions are answered. Some of those answers even come in the first five minutes of the movie. Is everything answered? Well, let’s just say anyone wondering where Jar Jar Binks or Boba Fett are can keep wondering. So not everything. At least for most things that matter, we get strong implications if not outright explanation. How viewers react to The Rise of Skywalker can probably be predicted by which of the sequel trilogy movies so far they like most. Team Force Awakens should thoroughly enjoy, while Team Last Jedi may not. But don’t read too much into that — J.J. Abrams has not by any means tossed out or retconned everything Rian Johnson came up with. Indeed, certain moments here depend upon setups in The Last Jedi. The distinction is more one of directorial voice. Abrams directs like Star Wars is more important than he is, while Johnson writes and directs as though his ideas take precedence over serving the larger franchise. That has not changed. Beyond that, The Rise of Skywalker is most comparable to the other “part 3’s” in the saga: Revenge of the Sith and Return of the Jedi. There are elements of greatest hits and victory laps, and of course all three are enhanced by Ian McDiarmid’s effortless menace as Emperor Palpatine. It is presumably common knowledge by now that Carrie Fisher appears in the new movie courtesy of deleted footage from the prior installments. Quite naturally, nobody involved wanted to suddenly kill Leia off just because Carrie Fisher died abruptly. Unfortunately, the newly created scenes play awkwardly, with the digital compositing not quite at a level it needs to be, and conspicuous cuts away from her face when an obviously new line of dialogue is used. As a technical exercise, it’s more successful than most of George Lucas’ Special Edition changes. Still, it’s hard not to wish Abrams had found a different way around the issue. A finale needs to be epic, and Episode IX brings about a long overdue increase of scope. So far, the sequel trilogy largely stuck to sparsely inhabited worlds and deep space. Here, it returns to a populated galaxy of the kind we saw in the prequels and Rogue One. Granted, the planets aren’t very original this time — Another desert? Another winter world? — but their inhabitants are interesting. Daisy Ridley does her best work yet in the series, partly because Rey is given more complex issues to work with. There’s more going on this time than simply being the last hero with a lightsaber. Plus there’s the whole dynamic with Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren that needs resolving, and what Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio came up with feels just right. (It could have easily gone very wrong.) Ridley, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega have a nice easy chemistry with very understated hints at romantic tension. Lando Calrissian doesn’t have a lot of screen time, but it’s sufficient to give him the closure he deserves. Of the new cast additions, Richard E. Grant unsurprisingly does the best. The man seems born to play an Imperial officer. Naomie Ackie and Keri Russell manage to do a lot with a little screen time, while a small puppet critter named Babu Frik (voice of Shirley Henderson) feels sure to be a hit with kids. Larger themes at play might involve spoilers, and are best left for another day. There are, however, fewer here than in the last installment. Abrams is more interested in getting back to an adventure serial than dealing with the intersection of capitalism and war, or whether the past should die. Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) doesn’t even lecture anyone anymore. Some key moments feel a tad too similar to things we’ve seen in recent superhero movies. But given the timing, that could be coincidence. No conclusion to the saga can possibly please everyone, but the balance between spectacle and character on display here fits the bill. There might be small things that needed tweaking, but nothing as major as those Disney-cute street kids from Canto Bight. Yes, some secondary threads could easily inspire continuations in the future. But if it ends here, the Skywalker saga can rest easy in the Jedi afterlife, knowing a good ending was had. Luke Y.

"Dec 18, 2019"," It goes without saying that for fear of even the most mild of spoilers, I ask that you please do not read any further until after seeing the film. If you’re anything like me, go into the film knowing as little as possible. The saga ends as it begins on the desert planet of Tatooine as one character looks out at the twin sunset.  How did we arrive here?  Well, it started over 42 years ago when Star Wars was first released in theaters.  You couldn’t have asked for a more fitting ending to the saga.  It’s a perfect ending in that regard. The sequel trilogy will go down in history as being equal to or better than the original trilogy.  There’s always a lot going on and many characters to keep up with.  This part didn’t bother me in the slightest.  If there is any complaint, it’s that screenwriters Chris Terrio & J.J. Abrams decided to write a sequel to Star Wars: The Force Awakens rather than Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  In some ways, you can’t fault them for doing so.  Abrams is only seeing to his vision of the story created when the franchise resumed.  No matter what one thinks, this certainly doesn’t change the fact that The Last Jedi took place.  It goes without saying that toxic fandom can’t and should never win. Appropriately, the film sticks to just a few key planets.  Much of the film’s plot evolves around Sith planet Exegol.  You guessed it!  This is exactly where we find Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid).  Not surprisingly, he died and came back to life in preparation for The Final Order.  I’ll refrain from spoilers but let’s just say that Darth Sidious has always been lurking in the shadows since Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.  That he had any involvement with the sequel trilogy’s narrative should surprise no one.  Unlike animated series such as Star Wars Rebels, the films haven’t really explored Sith history or their temples.  We’ve seen the Sith Wayfinders before–most recently in a recent episode of Star Wars Resistance.  Statues of the Four Sages of Dwartii make a return appearance albeit much larger than they were in then-Chancellor Palpatine’s offices in the prequels. Sadly, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker marks the last film for Carrie Fisher.  Abrams utilizes unused footage from Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  Our favorite princess certainly gets a fitting farewell.  I couldn’t imagine any other way for her to pass away.  Is it the way we imagined?  No, it isn’t.  Thankfully, Princess Leia was not among the Rebellion’s old guard that perished in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.  It would have been a tragedy in its own right.

"Dec 18, 2019"," The Rise of Skywalker is a bad movie and a miserable finale that serves no purpose other than to reassure adult fans of the original Star Wars that they are still the “chosen ones” of the pop culture galaxy. Spoiler warning: I do mention specific details about the first few scenes, but otherwise there are no spoilers save for “read between the lines” notes about the film’s overall construction. Reader discretion is advised. Given the loud and SEO-friendly backlash to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I half-expected The Rise of Skywalker to be something of a walk-back in terms of tone, plot and exposition. After all, The Empire Strikes Back was itself a dramatic departure from Star Wars, and it was followed by a threequel (Return of the Jedi) that was closer in spirit to the first movie. What I was expecting, at worst, was a well-made and character-driven action fantasy that perhaps contained plot threads or story beats for which I didn’t care. You can enjoy both Batman Returns and Batman Forever.  Alas, J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio’s Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a genuinely bad movie, one that repeats the fatal mistakes of the likes of Spectre, Spider-Man 3 and The Crimes of Grindelwald to end the Skywalker Saga on an all-time low. The problem with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker isn’t just that it absolutely walks back a number of potent reveals and plot threads from the last movie, but rather that the 142-minute movie spends almost its entire running time retconning its predecessor and adding painfully conventional “plot twists” and patronizing reversals in the name of mollifying the fans who merely want to be reminded of the first three movies. It inflicts additional damage to the legacy of the first six Star Wars movies. It undermines the previous two “episodes” in the name of giving (some but not all) original-trilogy Star Wars fans a reassuring pat on the head. It even shies away from The Force Awakens’ darker real-world implications. It is so concerned with character reveals and “chase the MacGuffin” plotting that it finds no time for any real character work. Things start promisingly enough, with a grim and visually dazzling sequence (for the record, the whole movie looks great) in which Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, doing what he can to sell some awful dialogue and plotting) kills his way to the location of a still-living Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). The former Emperor promises command of countless newly created warships as long as Ren ends the Jedi order by killing Rey (Daisy Ridley). Okay, fine, the Emperor’s back, but at least that reveal is done right off the bat. The next sequence, involving multiple jumps to light speed, plays out like the Star Tours ride. But once we find ourselves back in the new home of the fractured Resistance, well, you have huge chunks of plot that are written and edited around deleted scenes of the late Carrie Fisher. That’s when things start to implode. With all due respect, Carrie Fisher’s performance in The Force Awakens was not her best work, and now we’re dealing with deleted scenes from that previous Star Wars movie being awkwardly inserted, not unlike Raymond Burr’s Godzilla footage, into this new movie. Everyone else is required to act around her, with the story dictated by what footage they had on hand, resulting in some genuinely goofy filmmaking (see: Leia and Rey pass a lightsaber back and forth because it’s probably two takes of the same deleted sequence!). The Resistance immediately gets word that Palpatine is alive and has raised a world-killing army of super-ships, news that everyone takes pretty well. I guess it’s only slightly disconcerting that (metaphorically speaking) Hitler is still alive 35 years after World War II and is planning on teaming up with the USSR to try to enslave the world again. We then jump into a “go to the place and find the thing” adventure, and the filmmakers seem to think that the mere idea of Rey, Finn, Poe and Chewbacca on a journey together is in itself incredibly compelling. Alas, absent memorable dialogue and much in the way of honest interaction, plus two extraneous new characters seemingly meant to “no homo” Finn and Poe, the journey becomes about the destination. That destination is merely more arbitrary plot reveals. Did you love how the last Fantastic Beasts movie spent most of the movie hinting at and eventually revealing irrelevant connections between characters? Did you love how Spectre tried to retroactively make Blofeld “the author of all your pain” in the three previous Daniel Craig 007 movies? Or how about how Spider-Man 3 revealed that the Sandman actually kinda-sorta killed Uncle Ben? You’re in for a treat. It’s not just that Rise of Skywalker undoes Last Jedi’s “it’s not your franchise anymore” metaphors—aimed at a generation that grew up loving Star Wars and then allowed two Palpatine-ish leaders (George W. Bush and Trump) to come into power—for generic “don’t worry, Star Wars is still the best!” fan bait. It’s that this is the only real reason this movie exists. It is focused on plot over character and is written with the “we got to stop that laser!” intelligence of a bad Saturday morning cartoon. When there already exists some very good kid-targeted Star Wars toons (Rebels, Clone War, etc.), one cannot escape the fact that Rise of Skywalker has turned this entire new Star Wars trilogy from a kids’ franchise into one aimed at nostalgic adults yearning for a time when they believed they were the most important generation. Adam Driver does his best trying to sell this nonsense, and there’s a momentary glance when he unexpectedly finds himself with a weapon that has more charm and character than any number of “applause now” introductions or fan-friendly callbacks. The film continually teases status-quo altering events and then immediately walks them back, offers generic action where even the seemingly emotional showdowns are interrupted by digressions and past-tense exposition, and gives Daisy Ridley essentially no real arc of her own. The screenplay never forces her to make any hard choices or live with the consequences of her mistakes. The plot is shockingly similar to Frozen II, but even that film, as random as its narrative seemed, prioritized character and emotional honesty over plot, which is why it resonated despite the story issues. Finn, Poe and Rey are mostly action figures moved into place as the plot demands. The Rise of Skywalker is possibly worse than any prior Star Wars “episode.” It ends a legendary franchise with a thud while denying this new trilogy its artistic reason for existence. It represents the cultural theft of Star Wars from today’s kids by today’s arrested-development-stricken adults. Star Wars was a franchise first and foremost for children, and the kids who grew up with Harry Potter, The Hunger Games and the MCU have embraced harsh truths and challenging narratives. Lucasfilm and Disney’s The Rise of Skywalker feels explicitly crafted for the “Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars!” and “George Lucas ruined my childhood!” demographics, right down to its near erasure of Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico. It’s bad enough that adults no longer see grown-up movies in theaters, but now yesterday’s geeks who have taken over pop culture feel entitled to have the kid-friendly franchises aimed at them as well.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Yes, that fan service line reappears in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” The ninth and final film in the space saga teems with Easter eggs, shout outs and other franchise-friendly nods. Is this any way to cap the biggest pop culture franchise of the modern era? Where do we send the apology cards to “The Last Jedi?” The opening text crawl warns of an old foe’s return. Yes, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) may have plummeted down an endless void in “Return of the Jedi,” but he never really went away. That means Daisy Ridley’s Rey puts her Jedi training on hold to rejoin the fight. The same goes for Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), together again after “The Last Jedi” kept them apart for so very long. Toward that end, it’s good to see the new “Star Wars” trio front and center. Too bad the new cast additions offer so little to challenge or engage them. Keri Russell plays a mystery woman from Poe’s past, but her face is mostly hidden and she’s gone before their chemistry can make a cameo. The late Carrie Fisher appears as General Leia Organa one last time. Her arc is understandably abrupt, given her death predated “The Last Jedi’s” release. That doesn’t explain why Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico gets so little attention. Perhaps Team Star Wars heard from fans (or Russian trolls, tee hee!) who felt she added little to the previous installment. Another clue the powers that be learned from franchise naysayers? “Rise of Skywalker” lacks the woke posturing of its predecessor. While “The Last Jedi” trafficked in faux girl power shtick and an income inequality detour, “Skywalker” keeps the focus on entertainment. Deeply flawed and occasionally silly entertainment, but let’s give credit where it’s due. On that front, Billy Dee Williams delivers some old school charm as Lando Calrissian. Those expecting him to play a major role in the story haven’t watched the most recent films in the canon. The film depends entirely on Rey’s heroism, her inner strength. The petite actress stands tall, time after time, even if Abrams can’t give her one dazzling action sequence to call her own. There’s plenty to complain about the new, Lucas-free trilogy, but casting Ridley, Boyega and Isaac proved undeniably shrewd. And let’s talk about the film’s plot twists and story devices. Remember, this isn’t a dashed off episode of a streaming series. This is Disney … and “Star Wars” … and a property designed to make north of $1 billion at the box office. One plot device in particular is absurd at first, and grows sillier as the story progresses. A serious twist, one that gives the Resistance a rare advantage, is beyond loopy. The character in question defends the reveal with a single line, another sign the script (by multiple scribes) wasn’t give a thorough scrubbing. The film briefly comes to life when our heroes assemble underground in the first hour. Their bickering is suddenly sharp, suggesting the exposition heavy start will give away to something more organic and raw. It’s worth comparing “Return of the Jedi,” which capped the original trilogy, with “The Rise of Skywalker.” The former spent less time developing characters because the first two films did the job so efficiently. Here, we see variations of Rey, Finn and Poe hugging, or bonding, or otherwise tapping a sense of nostalgia that never materialized in the first place. Otherwise, we’re rushing from one glossy set piece to the next, the connective tissue as thin as Rey’s linen garb. Through it all one chronic complaint endures. Why doesn’t Rey use the Force more often when she and her friends are in harm’s way? Adam Driver remains a rising star with plenty of presence. His lanky frame and shaggy ‘do don’t hurt either element here. Still, his dastardly Kylo Ren never coalesces in the new trilogy. He was the petulant powerhouse in “The Force Awakens,” a twist on Darth Vader’s composed threat. He morphed during “The Last Jedi,” sharing a curious bond with Rey (arguably “The Last Jedi’s” most intriguing development). Abrams successfully brought the franchise back from a deep sleep with 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” in no small part thanks to Harrison Ford’s triumphant return. Yes, Abrams had plenty of franchise boxes to check off in “Awakens,” but it felt like he saw it as a privilege to do so. Perhaps Rian Johnson’s “Last Jedi” painted Abrams into an impossible corner. No matter. A franchise with as many glorious highs as “Star Wars” deserves a far better finale than this. HiT or Miss: We regret to inform you that the mighty “Star Wars” saga ends with an embarrassing whimper courtesy of “The Rise of Skywalker.”",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," Concluding the saga that George Lucas so boldly forged some 40-years ago and serving as a continuation to the franchise’s most daring (and divisive) entry, The Last Jedi, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker arrives with a certain amount of pressure.  Rian Johnson (The Last Jedi‘s helmer) argued that bolder, more inventive ideas should be adhered to in telling stories, making the sane note that telling the same story over and over again creatively stifles whatever potential the series has. Given that more of the same has returned platinum results for the Disney canon (for the most part), Johnson’s defiant stance went against everything the House of Mouse were known for, so it made sense (however disappointingly) that he would be looked over in favour of J.J. Abrams, a reliable genre filmmaker who forged The Force Awakens towards a $2 billion haul.  And whilst Abrams has proven himself within the Star Wars universe, here he panders so much to the fans that anything that should feel remotely heartfelt comes off as inauthentic service. A convoluted first half immediately sets off warning bells that The Rise of Skywalker won’t be the Star Wars its fans deserve, with the Abrams/Chris Terrio-penned script essentially ignoring much of what Johnson and The Last Jedi put forward; almost as if the franchise has given in to the detractors that came so savagely for that film and apologised in the process, the on-screen time dedicated to resistance mechanic Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran, undoubtedly The Last Jedi‘s most controversial and attacked component) has been seriously reduced, despite Johnson’s previous efforts to suggest a continued relationship between her and stormtrooper-turned-resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega). Speaking of Finn, his character hardly feels of much use throughout either, and as much as his chemistry with Oscar Isaac’s fighter-pilot Poe Cameron burns brighter than any other supposed bond the two share with their fellow players, the hope that Star Wars would give us a same-sex love story is shot down as quickly as one of the many spacecrafts that lose their flight pattern in the film’s standard action set-pieces; and of the subject of pandering, the briefest shot of a female resistance member locking lips with her (presumed) wife doesn’t count towards this series marking a moment of progression. But what of the actual story? Well, dark Sith lord Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, once again chewing the scenery like he hasn’t been fed in years) has returned, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) wants to take him down whilst simultaneously hoping to track down Rey (Daisy Ridley) to convert her to the dark side, all the while she’s harnessing her Jedi powers to defeat the First Order.  It’s an expected storyline with only the most minor of surprising revelations, and though the push-pull temperament between Kylo and Rey results in a logical conclusion, Driver and Ridley at least elevate their material beyond its surprising simplicity.  Also working far more than it should is the largely-CGI rendering of Carrie Fisher as Leia, the late actress ironically delivering the film’s most heartfelt performance. Though The Force Awakens paid fan service, the seeming gimmick of overt focus on re-emerging characters – Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian being a prime example – is one Abrams adheres to almost too often here, as if he’s afraid that audiences will tap out if the camera decides to take a breather.  There’s such frenzied, kinetic energy on board here that it’s almost insulting that it’s adopted to mask the fact that much of The Rise of Skywalker‘s first half is devoted to planet-hopping adventures that barely add anything of narrative weight to the proceedings. As to be expected though, when the film aims for aesthetically-pleasing visuals it delivers accordingly, with a stormtrooper battle across the desert momentarily exciting, as well as arguably the piece de resistance of the film – a gorgeously rendered lightsaber battle between Kylo and Rey among tsunami-sized waves crashing violently around them.  As epic they are in proportion, emotionally they’re shallow, which could almost serves as the film’s mantra. As a film on its own merits, The Rise of Skywalker is a passable action affair that never presents material that truly feels like its putting any of its players in legitimate peril.  It’s safe, and there’s nothing particularly wrong with that when being viewed as a standalone feature (however underwhelming it may be), but something like this can’t help but be compared to both the recent films that directly preceded it as well as serving as the ultimate culmination of a film series that started out so strong, temporarily retreated, before righting itself again with a duo of entrants that respectively tipped their hat to its fans with a coherent sense of fun and maintained a bold sense of self in its vision of storytelling, something this sadly has neither of.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," How do you review a movie like Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? A movie the whole world wants to know about but doesn’t want to know about? By giving people choices. So here, reader, is a choose your own adventure review of The Rise of Skywalker. You may recognize the format from our review of JJ Abrams’s first mystery box of a Star Wars movie, The Force Awakens. Navigate below for as little or as much feedback as you’d like. Please note: no portion of this review discusses anything that would qualify as an actual spoiler for the film, such as major reveals, nor does any portion of the review detail anything more than you’d see in a typical movie review. If you want actual spoilers, go check out Reddit or something.  This was a lot of movie shoved into one movie, and there were parts I liked. It’s not in my best or worst movies of the year. As its own entity it functions much better than it does as a part of something larger. I don’t, however, think it was successful overall as a third act in this trilogy. For some background on my Star Wars tastes – I loved The Force Awakens for its amazing ability to craft characters and build a new world for this series. I liked, but didn’t love, The Last Jedi, which I think achieves higher highs than TFA (Rey and Kylo got the best scenes, and the battles of all kinds look incredible) and lower lows (the casino fetch quest, Poe, etc.). The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson had some great ideas and an eye for stunning visuals, and Abrams is a master at character generation and puzzle building. I think they complement each other well and could have, working in unison, created an amazing trilogy from start to finish. What we got, instead, was an Abrams movie, followed by a Johnson movie, followed by an Abrams movie, with ongoing diminishing returns as each pivoted from the other instead of organically growing. Clearly distinct movies operating in separate domains with separate ideas and goals. The result is a disjointed experience and a disorienting final chapter that spends too much time retreading old ideas and not enough time creating new ones. None of this was a huge surprise to me, though, and The Last Jedi arguably suffered from this too. What did catch me off guard is the way The Rise of Skywalker looks. I thought one of the most unifying aspects of the first two films in this trilogy is that they were both visually breathtaking. TFA used lots of negative space and sprawling desert to paint a beautiful picture, and TLJ used evocative colors and bold contrast to create a vivid palette for its story. It seemed fair to assume this third movie would look great, if nothing else. But The Rise of Skywalker looked muddy, busy, and messy. It mostly trades stunning, sprawling canvases for cramped interiors and feels like a movie shot almost wholly in a studio and on fake sets. Everything happening on screen feels like it’s out of utility rather than composition. There were parts I liked, though, and they mostly come back to character work. As has been the case all along, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) continues to be a compelling and masterful villain. His character arc is close to being exactly what I wanted. I also felt like Poe (Oscar Isaac) was largely underserved by TLJ, and I think this film does a good deal to correct that, putting him squarely in the film’s foreground by giving us a small bit of insight into his backstory. In small ways, too, it feels like a film that knows its characters and their sense of humor. And even though the film is the trilogy’s final chapter, The Rise of Skywalker also manages to introduce several new characters, both humanoid and alien. I liked almost every new addition without feeling like they were taking away from the overall narrative, which isn’t an easy feat. Lastly, it didn’t feel like there were any unimportant “B” plots in The Rise of Skywalker. There’s plenty of McGuffin chasing and fetch questing, but the core group of characters does this together, all propelling to the same plot point. The Rise of Skywalker takes place an undetermined amount of time after The Last Jedi and focuses on the return of Emperor Palpatine. Both the good guys and the bad guys want to know where he is and what his plans are, and they spend most of the film hunting down devices that could lead them to his coordinates. Kylo Ren wants to find him because he views Palpatine as a threat to his own power, while The Resistance needs to find him to protect themselves and their cause. Rey, meanwhile, struggles to fulfill her Jedi training and understand her place in this narrative, particularly given the confusing connection she felt with Kylo Ren. The politics of this trilogy have never been very clear, so for this non-expert viewer, I assumed Palpatine was simply an addition to The Bad Guys. But Kylo Ren being egotistical enough to view Palpatine as a threat instead of an ally is an interesting pivot from what I expected, and one which pits The First Order and The Resistance against each other when vying for the Emperor’s coordinates but also in search of a mutual goal: Palpatine’s destruction. This all works for me in its broad strokes. When I say The Rise of Skywalker retreads old territory, though, I don’t just mean the original trilogy. It certainly has callbacks and nostalgia for the older movies in spades, of course. But it’s clear Abrams felt he had to rectify the trajectory for this movie that was set in the second film, rendering so much of that movie null and void. The Rise of Skywalker relitigates ideas that seemed settled and even moves some of its characters backwards in order to push them forwards again. On a whole it feels too much like a course correction to instead of a natural extension of TLJ. Because of that course correction, we get too much plot shoved into the confines of the 2 hour and 20-minute film – in some ways this movie feels like a miniature episode 2 and 3 stuck together. My biggest problem with The Rise of Skywalker, though, is how it lands its most important moments. These are moments where I appreciated the idea but the execution of it was just underwhelming. They arrive with mostly a dull thud instead of a rush of excitement and emotion. Some of that is just due to them being awkwardly shot or staged, but there were at least two moments where I felt like I should be taking in the scene with a lot more emotion than I did. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker had a monumental task to undertake. It’s been a year of controversial endings (Avengers: Endgame, Game of Thrones), proving how difficult it is to close sprawling narratives without some people feeling left out in the cold. RoS wasn’t a total bust, for me, and I enjoyed large parts of the ride. If you hated The Last Jedi, you might even love it. But it’s hard for me to see it as a successful third installment because it spends too much time dwelling on its past and not enough on its future. Kylo Ren said it best: You’re still holding on! Let go! The main criticism I’ve heard of Rise of Skywalker is “too much fan service.” Of course, if you’re a hardcore enough fan, there’s no such thing. I’ll see it next week. @mel M; In what universe should the Yuzzan Vong invasion, that starts with Chewie getting a friggin’ moon thrown on him, be the real timeline? The EU had some good moments, but after Visions of the Future, it just plain sucked! I was surprised that they stole so much from Dark Empire, though. Including spending 90% of the the setting things up, only to be underwhelming in its conclusion.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is red meat for the ravenous masses. It is a filet mignon of fan service, a film that checks every box. And ties all threads together for an epic saga; a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. It is anti The Last Jedi, for those who despised episode eight; a heavy infusion of nostalgia from the original trilogy, a slight nod to the maligned prequels, and a rousing finale to the Jedi versus Sith conflict. The Rise of Skywalker wants satisfaction for all. It comes close enough to be successful. A few cheers will erupt. A tear or two may be shed. You will certainly be glued to the screen for every second.   As Rey (Daisy Ridley) trains under Leia's (Carrie Fisher) tutelage, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) faces an unexpected challenge. A voice, long thought destroyed, sends terror across the galaxy. Could Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) still be alive after all of these years? If so, how was he able to mask his presence? Why is he surfacing now? Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) follow a mysterious clue left by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). But Rey cannot hide, or ignore her connection with Kylo Ren. He's uncovered more information about her past. She is becoming immensely powerful. Their conflict setting the stage for the final battle between the light and dark side of the force.   The Rise of Skywalker is densely plotted with shotgun pacing. The screenplay by director J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio has an avalanche of exposition. The characters jump from planet to planet on their quest. New subplots are uncovered while existing storylines go much deeper. Taking a bathroom break for two minutes could leave you completely lost. The film is constantly revealing important information. Some of it is mind-blowing, others way too convenient. One of the flaws in The Rise of Skywalker is the reliance on an assortment of strange objects. They pop up throughout the film to propel the action. The use of devices is common in the Star Wars books and animated series. The search for Luke's lightsaber was the goal of The Force Awakens, but the gadgetry goes overboard here.   The relationship between Rey and Kylo Ren is the foundation for the current trilogy. Their journey is thoughtfully concluded in The Rise of Skywalker. I don't think Adam Driver gets enough credit for Kylo Ren and Ben Solo's complexity. His turmoil leads to a gripping resolve. The scenes between Adam Driver and Daisy Ridley are amazing to see. From insane lightsaber duels to moments of raw humanity, the primary leads enthrall. Fans will be dissecting their character arcs ad infinitum.   J.J. Abrams uses the existing Carrie Fisher footage brilliantly in the plot's context. Leia doesn't have a lot of screen time, but is absolutely pivotal to the outcome. Her presence adds the emotional gut punch to the film. It's great to see Billy Dee Williams again as Lando Calrissian. His part is also limited, but a fun treat. I suppose it's another example of fan service, but that's okay. Lando is a critical character in multiple Star Wars properties. He certainly deserves a place in the Skywalker saga finale.   The Rise of Skywalker has some head scratching, gloss over moments. Plot points and characters that were critical in the previous two films are brushed under the rug. A resolve to a key outcome from The Last Jedi makes sense, but is handled way too quickly. Supporting characters from that film are marginalized. Kelly Tran's character of Rose Tico barely registers on screen. It's obvious that the honchos at Lucasfilm are responding to the backlash. For the record, I thought The Last Jedi was great. It's understandable to smooth out the perceived negatives. J.J. Abram's uses an out of sight, out of mind approach. It needed to be handled in a more creative way.   Imagine a Star Wars focus group submitting a list of everything they wanted in episode IX. The Rise of Skywalker crams it all in with fervor. It's not a perfect ending, but fitting and definitely heartfelt. Most fans will be satisfied. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is produced by Lucasfilm and Bad Robot with distribution by Disney.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. It seems that for Netflix strong reviews and an Oscar winner in the cast is not enough to ensure a series making it beyond one season.  Megamind vs. The Doom Syndicate was already being torn apart on social media, and things have only become worse as the scathing reviews piled in. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Well, here we are at the end of all things. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the movie billed as the conclusion to the saga/mythology/lifestyle choice that George Lucas launched some 42 years ago with an unassuming little $9 million space opera called Star Wars. That of course was back in those innocent days when not every film carried a subtitle, and not every story choice was fraught with meaning for films yet to even be conceived. Following the divisive, and at times toxic, debate over the previous installment, 2017’s The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker has been tasked with the unenviable challenge of not just providing a satisfying finale to the current trilogy, but also to the entire nine-film storyline that encompasses the Skywalker family melodrama and a galactic battle between good and evil. It also needs to please a plethora of fans with many different ideas of what this thing is supposed to be. Does The Rise of Skywalker succeed? Did director/co-writer J.J. Abrams (encoring after setting the whole thing in motion with 2015’s The Force Awakens) make something that managed to answer all the questions and deliver an exciting story while simultaneously honoring and burying the past? Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a master class in ticking off boxes, a movie that lumbers to a shaky start but eventually delivers a certain level of surface excitement and rapid-fire pacing that obscures just how flimsily constructed its narrative is. The movie is less a story than a compendium of things that need to happen just to create the superficial sensations certain Star Wars fans want to experience–and those things often work well as they happen, only for the viewer to chuckle afterward over how he or she has been played again. In other words, this is very much a J.J. Abrams movie: expertly made and well-acted (perhaps the best-acted of the entire new trilogy), but with no distinct point-of-view. It’s lots of callbacks and “surprise” cameos, and a narrative that’s very loosely remixed from a previous installment in the franchise. It throws a couple of bones to people who liked The Last Jedi’s deliberate subversion and deconstruction of Star Wars tropes, but make no mistake, it also explicitly and aggressively rejects that film’s concerns, applying a certain amount of retconning to the saga that may try even the hardiest series originalist. The first half hour of the movie almost derails it entirely, as it bounces from one environment to another setting up both the new plot and reconnecting us with the characters in a clunky, almost random fashion. It is absolutely no spoiler to say that Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is reintroduced within the opening moments of the film, but we will leave it for another time (and probably another writer, to be honest) to discuss the whys and hows of his presence here after 30 years. A whole lot of exposition and action follows haphazardly until we finally settle into the bulk of the main narrative. That narrative follows our core returning heroes–Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), plus C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo)–as they embark on a quest to find the kind of MacGuffin that usually ends up being the result of lazy screenwriting more than any Hitchcockian misdirection. While the search itself is needlessly elongated and convoluted, it does contain some of the movie’s best moments–at last we get to see our heroes mostly together, bickering affectionately and working toward a shared goal. Meanwhile, back at whatever planet the rebel/Resistance base is now located on, General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and her tattered, dwindling troops are trying to put on a brave front in light of the news of Palpatine’s re-emergence on the scene. And of course there’s her son, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who still grapples with his loyalties in the First Order’s new role. Getting any further into the plot would be spoilery, but suffice to say that there are revelations afoot which will do nothing to alleviate the divisions among Star Wars fans–divisions that have sadly been fueled in many ways by pre-existing prejudices that have nothing to do with the story at hand. Some old friends, such as Lando Calrissian (a delighted-to-be-there Billy Dee Williams), are trotted out along with a handful of new characters, but one gets the sense that they don’t contribute much to the narrative overall and are merely there as glorified walk-ons. As for our main heroes, all of them do their best work in the series to date. Driver’s Kylo Ren is still this trilogy’s most interesting creation, a truly conflicted character whose leanings and motivations are always in question. His final arc, while not entirely unforeseen, is still the most unpredictable of the bunch and Driver can do a lot with steely glares and silent gestures.  As for our central trio of Rey, Finn and Poe, they’ve always felt like a three-way redistribution of Luke, Leia and Han’s characteristics more than three-dimensional beings, but they get to add a bit more nuance here that makes them seem more alive than they have in the two previous adventures. Rey and Kylo also get to share some of their most intense exchanges of all three films, their relationship given a new resonance here, and also engage in one hell of a lightsaber duel atop the ruins of the old Death Star that is as much of a showstopper as the brief clips we’ve seen beforehand suggest.  Carrie Fisher’s much-documented appearance in the movie is, with perhaps one exception toward the end, handled about as seamlessly as it probably could be. Created from eight minutes of existing but excised The Force Awakens footage (and a different plotline entirely), it’s integrated well enough into this story to allow Leia a proper, if diminished, role in these concluding proceedings without simply having to write her out of the movie entirely. That’s one of those boxes that the movie at least checks off somewhat successfully. A lot of other moments in The Rise of Skywalker play out as curtain calls or “greatest hits” without doing much to serve the larger story. That story itself leads to a very familiar third act: one which doesn’t have the same stakes or emotional pull because we’ve seen so much of it before. A parade of beloved characters walking through and waving as well-remembered scenes are re-enacted around them is not a story, but a pantomime. And that, in the end, is the biggest problem with The Rise of Skywalker and this entire new trio of Star Wars entries: we’ve seen so much of it before, in slightly different form. That issue itself stems from the very origins of this chapter: a desire on the part of a corporate parent (Disney) to put more Star Wars movies on the screen but a lack of a strong central vision of what story to tell going forward. The result has been a franchise at war with itself, even as its fans go to war against each other: a literal, real-life embodiment of the entire brand’s title–with no clear victor in sight.",NEUTRAL

"Dec 18, 2019"," “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” the closing chapter in the third trilogy of the “Star Wars” saga, sputters to the finish line with its story of good and evil, Jedi and Sith, old and new. It’s all the tropes “Star Wars” fans are used to, but what it lacks in dramatic energy and forward momentum it attempts to make up for in the warm embrace of nostalgia. Its light saber is in dire need of a charge. Co-writer and director J.J. Abrams, flying his second “Star Wars” mission after 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” attempts to right the ship after 2017’s “The Last Jedi,” which left a bad taste in the mouths of superfans. “The Last Jedi” took risks and attempted to rewrite mythologies the “Star Wars” fanbase holds dear, and “Rise of Skywalker” is here to return things to the familiar. What it ends up exposing is the weakness of the world of the current series, and the lack of emotional investment in its cast of characters. This is not the “Star Wars” of yesteryear, and it shows. Not that it returns the series to the lethargic pacing of George Lucas’ middle trilogy of “Star Wars” prequels, which were as exciting as watching Chewbacca’s hair grow. “Rise of Skywalker” at least has a pulse. But it’s not as fun as “The Force Awakens” or as adventurous as “The Last Jedi,” and it’s more tethered to the past — and to its fanbase, and to corporate shareholders at Disney — than any previous entry in the series. “Rise of Skywalker” wisely focuses on the two strongest characters in the current “Star Wars” universe, Daisy Ridley’s Rey and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, who very plainly represent good and evil, respectively. Simply put, Kylo is out to kill Rey and end the Jedi, thereby becoming all powerful and finishing what his grandfather, Darth Vader, started. The burden of family and legacy weighs heavily in this universe. The chase between Rey and Kylo is where “Rise of Skywalker” comes alive, and Ridley and Driver create electricity in their scenes together. It’s everywhere else that “Rise of Skywalker” struggles to find its drive. Along the way, some familiar faces return, there are key goodbyes (some more permanent than others), and an adherence to the past that handcuffs Abrams and doesn’t allow him to make any bold choices or take the story anywhere new. He was hired to deliver a product, one that would please as broad a swath of people as possible, and thus “Rise of Skywalker” is rendered safe, bland and perfunctory. It’s there because it has to be there. Think about it: the original  “Star Wars” was so rich that it created a world that fans still want to live inside today, 42 years later. Will people feel the same about the characters of this trilogy come 2057? You don’t need the Force to tell you the answer to that one.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," For someone who loves just even being inside the world of ‘Star Wars’, this reviewer was predisposed from the beginning to enjoying JJ Abrams’ ‘Rise of Skywalker’. And while there are many things to be enjoyed about the final film of the allegedly final trilogy in the Skywalker saga, it’s impossible to shake the feeling that something isn’t sitting right. And it’s most probably because it’s trying so hard to “fix” the perceived missteps of Rian Johnson’s divisive ‘The Last Jedi’, a movie that was narratively a lot more braver and original than what we watched this week. Plot points, characters and themes introduced and carefully explored in ‘The Last Jedi’ have been hastily ditched to follow unnecessary new threads that further convolute the story. One of the most popular and biggest criticisms of ‘The Last Jedi’ was that the film took unnecessary detours, like the infamous Canto Bight scene including Finn (John Boyega) and Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran). Well, take that and crank it up to 11 and throw some steroids in there just for fun, and you get ‘Rise of Skywalker’. The final episode of the space opera begins right in the middle of some hair-raising action as Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) butchers through what looks like an entire village to get his hands on a special tracker that will lead him right to the Star Wars world’s You Know Who, Palpatine, who is in fact alive and well, to put it politely. In the rebel camp, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is going hard at her Jedi training, so she can be ready to take on Kylo and the First Order. One of the more touching and fitting moments in the early scenes of the movie is watching the dynamic between Rey and General Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher); there’s a mother-daughter bond safely tucked behind a tutor-mentor role that feels authentic here. Despite Snoke being cut into two pieces, Kylo has managed to keep his force communication channel open with Rey, and like in ‘The Last Jedi’, the chemistry between these two actors is still crackling. The frenemies are chasing each other across planets and systems, and while the jaw-dropping visuals are, well, jaw-dropping, you wish Abrams would have let you stop and smell the roses. There is so much action packed into the roughly two-and-a-half-hour movie, you feel exhausted only half way in. Another pair that is fun to follow is Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn. It looks like the makers listened to the internet and dug deeper into the bubbling bromance. There’s also a newfound confidence and swagger in the Poe-Rey-Finn dynamic ever since their narrow win at the Battle of Crait in the last movie, and watching the trio’s friendship blossom and deepen is rewarding. But guess who wasn’t invited to the party? Rose Tico, the mechanic-turned-resistance-fighter who took up considerable screen time in the last movie and also kicked butt while at it, was completely and quite rudely left out of any scene that moved the plot forward. Her role in this movie could have been played by an anonymous extra and no one would have blinked. Rose deserved better, and, sadly, so do ‘Star Wars’ fans. But, and this one’s a big but, ‘Rise of Skywalker’ is also decidedly one of the scariest things to be made in the Star Wars universe. It’s gloriously eerie and Abrams was definitely not afraid to lean into it; so much so that I often found myself covering my eyes, completely forgetting I’m watching a Disney movie. Does the film answer some of the burning questions you’ve had since ‘The Force Awakens’ came out in 2015? Yes. Will you like said answers? Most likely, no. Any scene that does not involve Rey, Kylo, Poe and Finn can be chalked down to fan service and hasty/lazy rewrites. As good as some of the callbacks and cameos are going to feel, you’re going to forget that good feeling the minute you leave the theatre because these moments have no grounding in terms of a serviceable script. This may be too early to say but I’d like to tenuously predict that the finale will probably be as widely panned as the ‘Game of Thrones’ finale, and it hurts to say this but the only thing that could have saved this movie would have been a cameo by Baby Yoda himself.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," With a nine-film epic franchise to conclude, it was never going to be easy for J. J. Abrams to bring Star Wars' Skywalker saga to a satisfying end.  Determined to tie up every loose-end left in the galaxy, from the originals all the way to Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker packs so much in to its two-hour-plus run-time that its hard to take it all in. While the plot has to mostly be kept under wraps, it can be said that the film sees Emperor Palpatine return, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and The Resistance trying to find him, while Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is also on the trail. Heavy with exposition in its first half, the film struggles to keep up with its lead cast as they quickly jump from one planet to the next, meeting a slew of new characters along the way who are barely given a chance to make a mark. Keri Russell's Zorri Bliss is severely underappreciated, for example, as she is mostly used as a way to develop Poe's story, while Naomie Ackie's Jannah is put through a similar fate, rather than the pair becoming strong characters in their own right. Resistance mainstays Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) do provide plenty of laughs with their entertaining double act, though, and it's nice to see the latter come into his own amongst the rebel forces in the course of his character's arc. But it is Rey and Kylo Ren who are given the most satisfying storyline, with the two battling it out throughout the galaxy while also coming to terms with the mental strains of their seemingly pre-destined paths.  Driver is a force to be reckoned with as the tormented Kylo, as his incredible, and surprisingly moving, performance easily makes his character one of the best to ever be seen in the franchise. Ridley's Rey is given the most unexpected storyline, though, and, while the details of this cannot be divulged, the star takes to the arc with finesse, and gives a subtle, emotional performance in the lead role. Meanwhile, Carrie Fisher's posthumous appearance through unused footage from The Force Awakens works remarkably well, as J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio's script builds scenes around her final scenes with such skill that it really feels like she was on set.  Regardless of what fans thought of The Last Jedi, the film did bring a lot of new ideas to the table, creating a space for exciting new opportunities and paths for the story to take, in contrast to The Force Awakens' nostalgia-filled plot.  However, rather than take this idea and run with it, The Rise Of Skywalker opts to backtrack into familiar territory, even going so far as to reference to -and undermine- what took place in its controversial predecessor. With Abrams at the helm this shouldn't come as a surprise, he is the safe pair of hands who was brought in to make the film following director Colin Trevorrow's firing in 2017, after all. That being said, there is enough to be enjoyed in The Rise Of Skywalker, at least when fans are given enough time to process what is happening on screen.  There's plenty of fan-service to be had that is sure to delight and amaze, while the stunning visuals and action-packed fights, both with lightsabers and in the sky, are incredible to behold.  The Rise of Skywalker may rush to its end, but Driver and Ridley's performances are sensational and make this film an interesting, if somewhat unsatisfying, end to George Lucas' beloved space opera.",NEUTRAL

If 2015’s “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” was the biggest fan film ever made, an elaborate rehashing of the Saturday matinee space opera that made the 1977 original such a singular cultural event, “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” slips into meta territory. Returning to direct the third installment of the blockbuster trilogy, J.J. Abrams has delivered a costly tribute to the tribute, with reverse-engineered payoff for anyone invested in these movies but wary whenever they take serious risks. It’s spectacular and uninspired at once, playing into expectations with a gratuitous fixation on the bottom line. After Rian Johnson’s shrewd attempt to deepen the “Star Wars” arc with provocative implications about individuality and psychological conflict, “Rise of the Skywalker” brings the third cycle of galactic warfare to a close by reverting to nostalgia and regurgitating the same old bag of tricks. That hardly makes it a total loss: With emerging rebel leader Rey (Daisy Ridley) providing a sturdy emotional foundation, and billions of Disney dollars fueling an obviously stunning array of special effects, “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t squander every opportunity to dial up the thrilling nature of the epic at hand, but all that razzle-dazzle can’t obscure a hollow core. In fact, produced in the age of internet-based fandom that reduces every cultural achievement to memes and conspiracy theories, “Rise of Skywalker” isn’t even a movie in the traditional sense so much as the blockbuster version of a Jedi mind trick — a hodgepodge of cameos and callbacks, snazzy lightsaber brawls and shrieking TIE fighters — all glued together by John Williams’ exuberant score and calibrated to create the perception of the ultimate gratifying finale. But it’s more the idea of that thing than the thing itself, zipping along with enjoyable bits and pieces but reducing the big picture to an amalgam of half-hearted ideas. Those who did appreciate “The Last Jedi” — which dared to make Rey a self-made woman, allowed Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to lose the faith, and complicated the moral compass of mopey villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) — already had a bad feeling about this. From “Star Trek” to “Star Wars,” Abrams excels at transforming established popular culture into a greatest-hits showcase, and his return to the director’s chair signaled that Disney wanted more of the same. Even by those standards, “The Force Awakens” managed to juggle some refreshing new characters who fit right into George Lucas’ established universe, and inject some iconic surprises that fit the story at hand. “Rise of the Skywalker” benefits from the sturdiness of that approach whenever it fixates on its core team: Rey, cocky Millennium Falcon pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac), and bumbling ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) radiate a charisma that hovers above the ham-fisted plot, in tandem with a sincere and heartfelt finale for Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia with some clever use of old material. The quest they endure for much of the movie finds the team of rebels racing against time to track down the evil lair where Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has seemingly emerged from his death at the hands of Darth Vader in “Return of the Jedi” to pull some dark strings. Literally: “He’s been pulling the strings the whole time!” someone actually says, as if they missed the dead giveaway in countless trailers. But…how? And is the menacing baritone emanating from a shadowy lair really the same wrinkled monstrosity who Anakin Skywalker sent careening to his doom 36 years ago? And if so, WTF? We won’t spoil those answers here, but it doesn’t take long for the movie to address them. “Rise of Skywalker” relegates its biggest revelations to a cramped sidebar some fans may have fun picking apart, but most will consider more than a little lazy. Having revitalized “Star Wars” with so many fresh faces, then losing the snake-like Supreme Leader Snoke in “The Last Jedi,” the series reverts to the exact same set of circumstances that wrapped the first trilogy. And yet those circumstances provide just enough material for the underlying “Star Wars” mojo to slip through in fits and starts. It’s hard to deny the collage of amusements that creep into this particular journey, from involving twists surrounding the fates of the franchise’s most charming inventions (Chewbacca and R2-D2, of course) to phenomenal action sequences that utilize the full scope of technological wizardry in play. One chase scene involving “light-skipping” ranks among the very best the “Star Wars” movies have to offer, and makes the case that the brightest future for this corporate-mandated series lies in pure spectacle-based experiences above all else. Alongside the rapid-fire pace, the new “Star Wars” movies retain a gorgeous, almost painterly aesthetic, and the current installment delivers on that front in every frame. From the neon-blue hues of lightsaber brawls to the sprawling outer space showdowns, “Rise of Skywalker” is always a visual marvel. When Rey and Kylo Ren face off with lightsabers atop a watery wreckage as waves crash all around them, the movie assembles the kind of sci-fi/fantasy marvel that only cinema of this scale can pull off. The script, co-written by Abrams and Chris Terrio, stands on sturdiest ground when playing up the conflict between these two wayward characters: One descended from the series most iconic characters, the other uncertain of her origins (at least until a questionable reveal here), Rey and new First Order Supreme Leader Kylo Ren engage in a constant sense of uncertainty about each other’s allegiances that remains engaging until their final scene. The writers utilize a brilliant device engineered in Johnson’s film in which they often speak telepathically from separate locations but manage to interact physically through a series of well-timed edits; it’s this sort of ingenuity that the movie lacks throughout the rest of its bloated running time. But, hey: If you pay for more “Star Wars,” the studio will get you some “Star Wars,” and even the slightest investment in the power of these movies can lead to certain euphoric highs. Who can argue with one last opportunity to ride with the Falcon through another daring jump, or watch Princess Leia guide her troops through uncertain warfare? Knowing as much, Abrams and co. push the innate power of the material to its breaking point, with a ludicrous closing battle in which virtually every facet of the series careens into the frame, with ginormous space fleets and intergalactic horses and a whole lot of shouting from every direction. It’s sound and fury signifying a desperate bid to ensure that something, anything, hell, everything sinks in for viewers keen on getting their maximalist fix. Lucas’ original “Star Wars” did plenty of imitating on its own: The spirit of a classic swashbucklers and samurai epics folded into a Flash Gordon formula made all of those ingredients feel new. Over 40 years later, “Rise of Skywalker” operates as if the only cinematic tradition at its disposal hails from a galaxy far, far away. At one point, a major character suffers from amnesia; by the end, the movie aims to make audiences feel the same way so it can go through the motions. The opening crawl warns that “the dead speak!” Indeed, the ensuing 142 minutes encapsulate a franchise eager to resurrect ideas that should have died long ago.

"Dec 18, 2019"," This image released by Disney/Lucasfilm shows Kelly Marie Tran as Rose, left, and Daisy Ridley as Rey in a scene from “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” (Disney/Lucasfilm Ltd.) Not much has caused a disturbance in the “Star Wars” galaxy quite like Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi,” an erratic but electric movie that, regardless of how you felt about it, was something worth arguing about. The same can’t be said for J. J. Abrams’ “Rise of Skywalker,” a scattershot, impatiently paced, fan-servicing finale that repurposes so much of what came before that it feels as though someone searching for the hyperspace button accidentally pressed the spin cycle instead. A laundry list of plot points cluster like an asteroid field in “Rise of Skywalker.” It’s a spirited, hectic and ultimately forgettable conclusion of the Skywalker saga begun 42 years ago by George Lucas.  It was also surely a lot to ask for. Abrams, having already ably and nimbly resuscitated Lucas’ space opera with the far less cluttered “The Force Awakens,” was brought back (like seemingly everyone is in “Star Wars,” dead or alive) with the task of not only wrapping up a trilogy but repairing the divides stirred up by “The Last Jedi” and stabilizing the franchise’s revolving door of directors. Abrams here took over for the jettisoned Colin Trevorrow, who retains a “story by” credit. More significantly, “The Last Jedi” had to solve the underlying existential crisis in “Star Wars,” a franchise in search of a reason beyond nostalgia (and, cough, billions of dollars) for continuing. The film, for sure, tries its damnedest to come up with something. It is one busy, hardworking movie. But if anything has been proven by the many attempts to rekindle the magic of the original trilogy, it’s that Lucas’ cosmic amalgamation of Flash Gordon and Akira Kurosawa isn’t so easily refabricated.  As the trilogy’s third act, “Rise of Skywalker” takes the general shape of “Return of the Jedi,” even resuscitating its villain: Emperor Palpatine (the very spooky Ian McDiarmid, now mostly a shadowy heap of CGI). He was last seen exploding in a Death Star air shaft, thrown to his apparent death by Darth Vader. Yet as “Star Wars,” the most forever war there is, marches into its fifth decade, the undying demands of a pop culture phenomenon and corporate revenue generator has led to some unsettling resurrections. This third “Star Wars” trilogy began with a plan: the first movie would belong to Han (Harrison Ford), the second to Luke (Mark Hamill) and the third to Leia (Carrie Fisher). Life interfered. Fisher, who along with Ford did more to enliven the original trilogy than any special effect, died of a heart attack in 2016. But she, too, has been brought back for “Rise of the Jedi,” via bits and pieces of old footage. For an actress of such live-wire verve, the composite result — a handful of brief lines and gazes — is a hollow non-performance. Palpatine, residing in a dark Sith lair, essentially sets the table. He summons Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) with an order to “kill the girl” (Daisy Ridley’s Rey) and thereby inherit the throne. With the wave of his hand, Palpatine unearths an entire fleet of Star Destroyers. They rise from the depths, a new armada of doom for the First Order. But this is only a piece of the movie’s manic start. Abrams, who penned the screenplay with Chris Terrio (“Argo,” “Justice League”), races to catch up with the many characters of the Resistance, among them Leia, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). From the start, there’s a rush to speed through a complex plot that sends a crowded Millennium Falcon in search of the hidden Sith base, a quest that includes a series of MacGuffins including — like a relic from a more earthbound adventure — a secret-wielding dagger. “Star Wars” has never lacked for velocity but the pace here is schizophrenic. The movie can’t sit still. Everyone’s yelling and most of the bits of humor along the way are too blandly inserted. (C-3PO, at least, is in fine form.) Part of the rush, it seems, is to dismantle some of Johnson’s groundwork and refocus the spine of the story on Rey’s destiny and her complicated relationship with Ren. Whether that’s a gesture to the toxic fandom unleashed by “Last Jedi” or not, some characters suffer for it, most notably Rose. She was the highlight of “The Last Jedi,” which stirringly realigned the traditional power dynamics of “Star Wars.” But she’s regrettably sidelined for much of the action this time.  Some of the tropes that Johnson deconstructed have been reassembled. Poe, the Han Solo heir apparent, is again central. New worlds bring new friends — a Stormtrooper-turned-rebel played by Naomi Ackie; an old rival of Poe’s named Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell); a cute Muppet-like creature named Babu Frik — and old (Billy Dee Williams’ Lando). Many of them make a good impression but the encounters proceed predictably.  To go too much into the narrative of “Rise of Skywalker” isn’t necessary and, besides, I’m not totally sure I could explain it all, anyway. That, in itself, is one of the movie’s most disappointing aspects: It’s trying too hard. What the streaming spinoff “The Mandalorian” has proven (besides that people will go absolutely gaga over infant Jedi Masters) is that simplicity of story line pays in “Star Wars,” just as it does in westerns. “Rise of Skywalker” aims for the brilliant parallel action of “Return of the Jedi” but ends up with mounted horse-like creatures charging on the wing of a Star Destroyer. Somewhere, Jar Jar Binks is celebrating. He might not be the most misplaced thing in the galaxy far, far away, after all. But even if “Rise of Skywalker” has its fair share of missteps, it gets some things right. The grief of a Wookie, for one. Kylo’s new black helmet, laced with blood-red cracks, for another. A lightsaber fight amid the sea-strewn rubble of a Death Star swells with watery grandeur. And most of all, the anguished Rey-Ren duel finally takes on the mythical dimensions of earlier “Star Wars” tugs between good and evil. Yet for a movie predicated on satisfying fans, “The Rise of Skywalker” is a distinctly unsatisfying conclusion to what had been an imperfect but mostly good few films. But hope springs eternal among “Star Wars” fans. Some will likely emerge from this latest installment paraphrasing Leia: “Help us, Baby Yoda. You’re our only hope.” “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” a Walt Disney Co. release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for sci-fi violence and action. Running time: 142 minutes. Two stars out of four.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker gets bogged down in exposition and course-correcting The Last Jedi, but does have some fun moments and fan service.  When Disney acquired Lucasfilm in 2012, the deal came with the promise of more movies, including a new trilogy in the Skywalker saga. That sequel trilogy launched in 2015 with J.J. Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens and continued in 2017 with Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Now it ends with Abrams' Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, with him returning as director, working from a script he co-wrote with Chris Terrio (Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice). The movie is also tasked with concluding the entire Skywalker saga, which kicked off more than 40 years ago with George Lucas' 1977 film. All that's to say Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has no small task ahead of it - not to mention the burden of expectations that come with one of the most popular movie franchises in history - and the film doesn't totally stick the landing. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker gets bogged down in exposition and course-correcting The Last Jedi, but does have some fun moments and fan service.   Much of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker's first act is focused on exposition and establishing Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) - in addition to Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) - as the main threat to Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), General Leia (Carrie Fisher) and the rest of the Resistance. It's a lot of story packed into the first part of the movie, enough that it could have been a film all its own - and, unfortunately, it comes off as the overly rushed middle chapter of Abrams' sequel trilogy rather than a sequel to Johnson's The Last Jedi. It also does a great deal of heavy lifting in terms of retroactively setting up Palpatine's return in an attempt to make the Emperor's reappearance in the story less sudden. However, it's not effective and instead just slows down the pace of The Rise of Skywalker's first act, stumbling until the movie finally gets going.   Once Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker gets past that early exposition, there's some fun to be had. Abrams and Terrio's script sends the sequel trilogy's trio on a mission that takes them around the galaxy, running across friends both old (Keri Russell's Zorri Bliss) and new (Naomi Ackie's Jannah). Ridley, Boyega and Isaac finally get to showcase their dynamic and they're electrifying to watch. They deliver a wonderful found-family relationship that's clearly filled with love - which extends to droids like BB-8 and new addition D-O, who's is a scene-stealer. But their trio is too quickly overshadowed by Rey's conflict with Kylo Ren in the latter half of The Rise of Skywalker, while Finn and Poe deal with their own struggles. Still, Ridley and Driver prove yet again to be a compelling duo on screen. Their conflict is complicated by Palpatine's rise in a way that won't work for all viewers because it walks back certain choices made in The Last Jedi, while continuing threads established in The Force Awakens. Altogether, there are sure to be favorite moments for every kind of Star Wars fan, but therein lies the problem of The Rise of Skywalker.   Over the last 40 years, Star Wars has become such a massively popular franchise that The Rise of Skywalker faces the impossible task of trying to please everyone. Abrams, Terrio and all those involved in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker make a valiant effort to do just that and give everyone what they want, but the result isn't so much a cohesive movie as it is methodical wish fulfillment loosely strung together by an overwrought plot. There are answers to all the questions Abrams posed in The Force Awakens while there is undeniable retconning of certain answers Johnson delivered in The Last Jedi. There's the inclusion of Fisher's Leia through unused footage, which isn't seamless but works well enough. There are gorgeously choreographed lightsaber battles, heavily CGI-ed (but still cool-looking) space battles, and the Knights of Ren are there sometimes. There are even some porgs. To be sure, there's something for everyone to like - if not love - in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, but the reverse is also true: There's something for everyone to dislike, if not hate, too.   Ultimately, Abrams spends so much of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker trying to give audiences what they want out of a Star Wars movie that it seems he forgot to deliver a good movie. There may be aspects of The Rise of Skywalker that surprise audiences, whether in Abrams and Terrio's story or Abrams' directing decisions, but nothing that has teeth, nothing that challenges viewers or subverts expectations. And, to be sure, that will please some fans just as it will irritate others. It's a relatively safe movie, attempting to return the sequel trilogy to the heights of The Force Awakens and move away from the divisiveness of The Last Jedi, but it's bound to be just as divisive for playing it safe as The Last Jedi was for the risks it took.   For all that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker stumbles its way to the finish line of the Skywalker saga by stuffing the film too full and ignoring or outright retconning elements of The Last Jedi, it's a fine enough addition to the franchise. Again, many (if not all) Star Wars fans will find something to enjoy in The Rise of Skywalker. Once the film moves beyond the issues of the first act, it sets a good pace that'll keep viewers entertained through the entire two-hour-and-20-minute runtime. As such, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is worth checking out in theaters if only to see how the sequel trilogy ends, or if viewers are seeking some big sci-fi spectacle, which Abrams delivers in spades. Given how much is stuffed into the movie, it may be worth repeat viewings, but only for dedicated fans who found enough to like to warrant a return trip. The Rise of Skywalker may not have stuck the landing of ending the Skywalker saga on a high note, but it's a reminder that perhaps forging a new path is the only way to a brighter Star Wars future.   Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is now playing in U.S. theaters. It is 141 minutes long and rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action.  The sequel to the 1986 classic Labyrinth is facing some major challenges, but it's already guaranteed to beat the original movie in a big way.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," As someone who was there at the beginning of that fateful summer of 1977, I’ve ridden the highs and the lows of the Star Wars saga over the years. During that time, there have been, shall we say, some truths I’ve clung to that depended greatly on my own point of view. I’ve reevaluated these films so many times over the years that, in the end, you just have to make peace with what you love and what you don’t when it comes to Star Wars.  It’s such a wide menu of choices, and everyone can take what they adore about these films and cherish them while punting the less savory aspects to the side. Ask any Star Wars fan, and they’ll tell you – they just ignore the things that they don’t enjoy and focus on the things they do. There was little in Episode IX that I could focus on and too much that I could not ignore, no matter how many emotional and mental exercises I tried to do to justify what I saw. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a bad movie, and I wish fervently that it was not so.  It breaks too many rules carefully established over the last 42 years, it is spiritually vacant that goes directly against the intentions of George Lucas in the first place, and it spends so much time fighting against the other films in the saga, especially the prequels and The Last Jedi, that it almost feels like a film made out of spite.  There are wide swaths of fans who may not enjoy the prequels, but let us be fair – Lucas may not be a very funny or a very romantic man, but there was a subtext to the prequels that absolutely works in the larger scale, a worldbuilding that is deeply rooted and makes solid sense. Same for the original trilogy, although a lot of that was done on the fly.  That’s because characterization was key, not some need to provide thrills every few minutes. The Rise of Skywalker cynically refuses to be quiet because it confuses silence with emptiness. It is busy, frantic, and scattered and ignores years of established story and characterization for cheap nostalgic thrills. The Force Awakens had a particular job to do, and while it may not have been elegant about it, it does succeed in bringing Star Wars back to a place of relative familiarity after the prequels took the saga away from its pulpy underpinnings to something wider in scope.  Rian Johnson took the ball that The Force Awakens handed to him and brought needed spirituality and a deeper context in The Last Jedi, reminding many of us why we fell in love with the saga in the first place – the themes and concepts may be boilerplate fortune cookie platitudes, but they still meant something.  There was a deeper connection in The Last Jedi that felt, and still feels, relevant: that it’s okay to be at your lowest point, and it’s okay to fail, as long as you use those failures and struggles as a foundation to build upon.  Many fans may not have liked certain aspects of The Last Jedi, but the film provided meaning and conviction and not simply nostalgia, which The Force Awakens has in abundance. The Last Jedi is about something. The Rise of Skywalker isn’t about anything. Now, it’s clear that J.J. Abrams loves Star Wars. He’s a part of that generation of filmmakers that was directly inspired by those films and probably used them as fuel to become an artist in his own right. Star Wars has that effect on people. But Abrams either ignores or doesn’t understand the underpinnings of why Star Wars resonates as strongly as it does with so many of us. Star Wars never existed in a vacuum.  Even from a cinematic standpoint, Star Wars has always been the culmination of many decades of influences – Westerns, Japanese cinema, Saturday matinee serials, and heroic movies since the medium’s invention. Star Wars was also a response to the cynical films of the 1970s and the malaise of a generation coming out of the Vietnam War and the tumultuous times surrounding it. Lucas also infused Star Wars with the examination of myth and why certain stories seem to resonate through the years.  All of Joseph Campbell’s deconstruction and study of those stories roots themselves in Star Wars. Then we have a sense of spirituality that, while perhaps basic and superficial at times, still infuses the films with a depth that took root in a generation of fans. None of that has seemingly registered with J.J. Abrams at all. None of that is in The Rise of Skywalker, except at a level that only works as a function of the plot. Abrams may sure enjoy driving the Star Wars car around the lot, but he has no idea how the engine works. Then there is the rulebreaking that The Rise of Skywalker freely engages in, and that is what got me truly angry at the film. There may be rules established that we do not care for, but those rules were at least thought out and placed within for a reason. We may not like midichlorians too much, but George Lucas had his reasons for putting them into the saga, and the least The Rise of Skywalker could have done was acknowledge them. But it is quickly forgotten or ignored.  Same with the concept of the Sith, or hyperspace, or even the nature of the Dark Side of the Force and the balance of the Force. The film has too much plot to stop and examine these things, and so they are freely tossed aside. The first hour of The Rise of Skywalker plays almost exactly like a video game – retrieve this item to find this item to find this person who knows where this person is being kept, and so on. The first hour of The Rise of Skywalker is terrible; the filmmaking is terrible, disorientating, and erratic. So, what works about The Rise of Skywalker? The acting of both Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver. They manage to find an emotional center to the story and hold on to that center for dear life. The same goes for the camaraderie between Oscar Isaac and John Boyega, and, surprisingly, the work of Anthony Daniels’ C-3PO, who may have the most satisfying arc of the whole movie. Threepio has always been a lovable annoyance throughout the saga, but here he is given real agency and a purpose, and I loved seeing Daniels rise to the occasion.  While the sequences with Carrie Fisher do not mesh as well as the filmmakers hoped they would, they are still effective and provide a lot of narrative drive. There is a lot of action in The Rise of Skywalker, to varying degrees of success. Abrams certainly knows how to film an action setpiece. Certainly, there are a lot of thrills to be had in The Rise of Skywalker, but for the most part, they are empty thrills.  There are certainly moments of weaponized nostalgia in The Rise of Skywalker that will elicit an emotional response to all but the most hardened fan – this saga is a part of so many of us, and it’s difficult to extricate Star Wars from much of our lives, and so you may be crying through moments that make no logical sense because it’s Star Wars and you just can’t help it. But the film falls apart like a Tatooine sand castle with the slightest push. I am angry that The Rise of Skywalker ends this saga with a resounding thud. The Last Jedi set everything up to at least give the saga a deeper, more satisfying finale, even if you didn’t like how that film went about it. But so much of The Rise of Skywalker‘s fan service seems false and… well, let’s just say it, corporate. The Force Awakens was the product of that Disney/Lucasfilm sale, but it only felt like that in a few moments. The Last Jedi never did. At the end of The Rise of Skywalker, I felt elated that the saga was over, and not in a good way. At least I can put this obsession to bed for a while. I’m sure I’ll come back to the Star Wars saga and remember it in fondness, enjoying the aspects I love while conveniently skipping over the things I don’t. But there’s too much you have to skip to make The Rise of Skywalker work in my mind. I guess I should be somewhat thankful that I can move on from Star Wars to some degree. But for now, I am angry, unsatisfied, and disappointed. This is no way to end a generations-long story and no way to make that story resonate for generations to come.

"Dec 18, 2019"," It all started in 1977 with a chase in space. However, laser swords, epic spaceship battles and a raspy villain were only a small taste of what Star Wars would ultimately become. 42 years later, the film franchise is finally reaching its end…but does it deliver? Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker comes a year after the events in The Last Jedi, where Rey (Daisy Ridley) continues training under the watchful eye of Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). But as the Alliance prepares to battle the First Order for the last time, the conflict between the Jedi and Sith finally comes to a head with the return of an old villain. It is easy to be swept up in the emotional investment from this 42-year-long saga. After multiple films, TV shows and even standalone films, Star Wars has always been a fan-driven franchise, so it needs a fitting ending.  After Colin Trevorrow left as director in 2017, it was up to The Force Awakens‘ J.J. Abrams to finish what he started. But his return comes the crux of the problem with The Rise of Skywalker as he is trying to recoup the fun factor after Rian Johnson’s dark intervention. The Last Jedi tried to develop Rey’s backstory and further involve Luke and Leia in the saga, but it only raised more questions. So now, the final instalment not only has to tie up loose ends but offer the climactic battle for the galaxy – and with these conflicting goals at stake, the intrigue and heart of the characters’ journey go out the window.  Rey’s ongoing discovery about her roots bounces between denial and exasperation while the guys’ sole focus is stopping the First Order, so the banter between all three has become stifled. This is partly due to Abrams and Terrio’s lacklustre screenplay and the middling plot while an unbalanced tone brings down subtle nostalgic touches amid the inconsistent direction. In addition, there is a sombreness that reinforces the finality of the saga and stifles the film’s entertainment factor.  Thankfully, The Rise of Skywalker delivers on its visuals as the spectacular effects complement the vast set pieces and thrilling action scenes. With regards to the cast, the late Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill have little to do so the franchise’s younger generation dominates the film. Ridley and Driver deliver emotionally fraught performances that balance Boyega and Isaac’s bromance, taking the weight of the veterans’ shoulders to carry the story to its end.  As a Star Wars film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has its moments but as the finale of a super-successful franchise, it fundamentally buckles under fan anticipation. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019","  By his own admission, director J.J. Abrams is bad at endings. “I’ve never been great at endings,” Abrams told The New York Times. “I don’t actually think I’m good at anything, but I know how to begin a story. Ending a story is tough.” So perhaps it should come as no surprise that Abrams’ grand conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, is a failure. The nature of the failure is also not entirely unexpected if you look at Abrams’ filmography. A skilled mimic, Abrams has trouble drilling down on the finer aspects of stories, relying more on nostalgia and recognition rather than surprising story turns. He’s able to paper over this weakness with endearing characters and breakneck pacing. He got away with it before with the charming-yet-safe The Force Awakens, but with The Rise of Skywalker, his weaknesses get the better of him resulting in a film with poor plotting, shallow character development, and underwhelming revelations.   Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) lives. Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) has sought out the Emperor because he represents a challenge to Kylo’s power, but Palpatine offers Kylo Ren the power of the Final Order, a fleet of Star Destroyers that will allow Kylo Ren to dominate the galaxy. In exchange, Kylo Ren must kill Rey (Daisy Ridley). Meanwhile, Rey, Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are tasked with finding a special artifact that will lead them to the Emperor so they can stop him and the threat he presents to the galaxy. However, along the way, as Rey repeatedly confronts Kylo Ren, she begins to learn the truth about her parentage (again).   Even from this brief synopsis, you can probably spot the myriad of problems that Rise of Skywalker presents. Since Palpatine isn’t dead, it means Darth Vader’s sacrifice in Return of the Jedi was pointless. Additionally, if Palpatine isn’t dead, it means he’s just been sitting around for a generation with a fleet of powerful ships waiting for someone to do him a solid (why he’s waited so long to send out his message is never explained). Furthermore, The Last Jedi ends with the First Order in a fairly dominant position, so why we need the Final Order more than the First Order doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.   But the larger problem with the movie is that Abrams is terrified of originality or doing anything bold that might be interpreted as unpopular. Again, he was able to get away with that in The Force Awakens, but here his reliance on nostalgia proves his undoing. You have a movie where the bad guy is Palpatine again. The characters have to go to the ruins of the Death Star. There are other things that I won’t spoil here, but at one point I threw up my hands in frustration and wished Abrams would stop digging through the past and try something new and daring. I don’t know if this movie was made in response to appease everyone who hated the fact that The Last Jedi made bold choices, but those folks can rest easy with a safe movie that makes no sense and has no character arcs. If all you desire is “I recognize the thing!” then Rise of Skywalker is the movie for you.   For all of its world-building, the Star Wars movies live and die by their characters, and despite casting winning actors, Abrams doesn’t seem to know what to do with them beyond Rey, who’s still wrestling with her parentage as well as the potential darkness inside her (a darkness that has never really appeared until this movie, although I’m sure apologists will now attempt to recast her prior actions in a new light). I really couldn’t tell you what Finn or Poe are dealing with in this movie and how they’re being challenged. Poe meets an old flame at one point and Finn makes a new friend, but there’s no attempt to build on these relationships or add another dimension to the characters.   Instead, a large portion of The Rise of Skywalker, which has some real ramshackle plotting and stumbles around uncertain of where to go next, feels reminiscent of the weakest moments from Return of the Jedi. In the weakest parts of that movie, beloved characters are tossed together and they’re going on an adventure, but the action doesn’t add any depth or challenge our protagonists in any meaningful way. The rampant timidity of The Rise of Skywalker leads to our characters going somewhere, the story advances for Rey, and everyone else is just along for the ride, which leads to a disappointing lack of payoff at the film’s climax.   I wish I could say The Rise of Skywalker was even moderately exciting in these set pieces, but even here, the action feels limp and stale. To compare Abrams to Abrams, there’s nothing here even half as exhilarating as the Millennium Falcon chase from The Force Awakens. It feels like we’re going through the motions of a Star Wars movie, but with a complete unwillingness to take any chances there’s nothing surprising or exciting. The only spark of life is when the movie stumbles into yet another idiotic reveal.   I’ll save commentary on those reveals for another article that contains major spoilers. However, I will say that when you have no vision for your movie other than to give the people what they want, then there’s really not going to be much in the way of thematic impact. Rise of Skywalker isn’t really about anything because it just wants to feed you back the things you already liked. You’ve already accepted Palpatine as a villain, so accept him again. You’ve already accepted nonstop iconography, so let’s have a set piece in the ruins of the Death Star. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker offers the warm embrace of a dancing corpse.   I don’t hate The Rise of Skywalker as much as I’m consistently disappointed by it. There are the occasional bright spots like what the film does with the character of Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) as well as a couple other nice surprises, but even here, it feels like Abrams doesn’t want to challenge his audiences as much as provide a constant stream of fan service. That bodes ill for the future of Star Wars as it takes the story away from grand mythology and reduces it to an easily packaged product that can be constantly resold to people who have already purchased a lifetime membership.   Fandom being what it is, there will be inevitable comparison between Rise of Skywalker and The Last Jedi, and I presently have no interest in such a comparison. Each film had to do different things and handles a different part of the story. I understand that for Abrams, there’s an incredible burden in concluding a story that’s been running since 1977 and is one of the most popular franchises of all time. And yet it appears that he chose to shirk that responsibility frequently with narrative dead-ends and cheap reveals. Star Wars isn’t just iconography or junk you liked from your childhood. It can be so much more than that, and it means so much more to countless people. The Rise of Skywalker renders the Skywalker Saga into something cheap, frail, and easily disposable.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Incestuous family.  Those are the words that come to mind here for a variety of reasons.  What started as a running joke about the lack of continuity turned into a kind of Huxleyan nightmare.  This metaphor works on all kinds of levels.  Luke/Leia, Rey/Ren, Fox/Disney… As one young rebel once said, “I can do this all day.” Well, he did, until he put on grandpa pants and teleported back to the pre-Civil Rights era to forget everything he spent his life fighting.  STAR WARS is a bit like that.  Invested in the point of no return, Disney and its army of throwaway writers, directors, plots, march off the cliff of sound judgment into the abyss. THE DEAD SPEAK! THE GALAXY HAS HEARD A THREAT OF REVENGE… shouts the opening crawl.  Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the menace son of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess/General Leia (Carrie Fisher),  rage-kills a bunch of creatures on an unnamed planet, looking for a kind of compass to point him to another planet called–  I should know what the name is.  They said it at least a hundred times more than they needed to.  It’s fiery, and red, and black, and its name sounds like a portmanteau of Exxon and Texaco. The device that guides Ren to this planet is, would you believe it, called a “wayfinder”.  That’s clever.  Light-saber.  Way-finder.  Mind-number.  We’ve no idea why or how Ren comes to discover the existence of this marker.  But I suspect if they felt it was necessary they’d tack on a third hour just to explain it.   But, never mind.  No, really.  Please. STAR WARS: THE RISE OF SKYWALKER is two hours and twenty-one minutes of exposition—dialogues explain, in excruciating detail, everything someone or some group does just before they do it—with lots and lots of close ups of individual actors reacting to, presumably, phosphor dots on a green screen stage.  Somewhere in the third act, the last vestiges of the rebellion work themselves up with one of those rousing speeches that should’ve the import of Patton but instead comes across with the jingoistic banality of Pullman (Bill), in Roland Emmerich’s INDEPENDENCE DAY.  Here a wide shot would stress the importance of family, but in director J.J. Abrams’ idea of STAR WARS, every man, woman, and child, is an island—or two if you count an odd jump cut marrying two different close-ups of Oscar Isaac.  It’s as if the filmmakers worried they might bore the audience if any one shot held their gaze for more than two seconds.  How do you make a movie that feels more like a video game than the one-take war film everyone’s talking about? Writers Abrams and Chris Terrio’s distrust in their own story suggests a twofold paranoia:  1. That prompting audience reactions is necessary only because you’ve given them nothing to which they can react.  2. That there are no real risks taken.  See #1. In the previous film, a bold maneuver—flying a ship through a blockade at light speed, ripping apart every vessel in range—makes us wonder why the Rebellion doesn’t use it more often, and on autopilot.  The response here, aside from rationalizing that moment in dialogue, is comical:  A fleet of Star Destroyers (the baddies’ ships, for the three people whose retinas remain unharmed by Disney’s marketing) so dense in formation, Poe remarks if they take them head on the ships will end up shooting each other.  And the guy who raised this fleet?  He displays such immense power, you wonder why the sequence exists in the first place, except to lengthen the running time of the end credits. The wit, wisdom, charm, and imagination of Star Wars is gone.  Take, for instance, Rey’s training.  It’s as if J.J. Abrams watched a wizened Yoda guiding Luke with lessons about transcending mind and body, yet thought the obstacle course was the point.  You almost want Beat Takeshi to show up with running commentary to liven up the whole affair.  Even an implied Han and Leia dynamic, attempted between the ex-smuggler Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell)—a female bounty hunter costumed in such an Art Deco throwback we might as well call her Daft Punkette, the Racketeer, or C3P2—gets thrown into the narrative cacophony, just to “no homo” the Poe/Finn relationship resonating within the fandom’s diversity.  Like Disney blithely dispatching 42 years of canon, even C3PO doesn’t hesitate to erase these horrid episodes from his own memory.  After all, how much do you want to bet there’s a backup drive? Then there’s the unused footage of Carrie Fisher that seems patched in, like it was shot for a completely different exchange but repurposed here.  There’s something  gauche about robbing an actor of her agency, the clarity and purpose of her performance.  Here, they re-animate Fisher, only to have to justify her death in service to a male character’s arc in a way that, the explanation itself feels like it’s capitalizing on something to which we shouldn’t be a party.   It feels cheap, like the moment in BOWFINGER where the director, Bobby (Steve Martin), tells his ingenue, Daisy (Heather Graham), he’ll never abuse her trust, while pilfering her credit card from her purse. What was once a thoughtful, evocative series, taking us to distinct worlds of sand, ice, lush vegetation, is now a galaxy surfeit with desert planets and earth tone linens, infantilized cultures—a sort of National Geographic survey of “savages” from exoplanets that just happen to all dress the same. After leaving the press screening I asked myself why I felt nothing for the characters of Ren, Rey, Poe Dameron (Isaac), and Finn (John Boyega).  There’s a habit in modern cinema to escalate the stakes to absurdity, then simply write an escape precisely where there needs to be one.  The idea of the immortal soul became a clever mechanism by which to extend some magnificent performances from Sir Alec Guinness, but at the same time it forewarned of its own abuse as a plot device.  At no time do we sense anyone is in any kind of mortal danger, because the afterlife doesn’t just exist, it glows and talks to you, often hunched over on a log in a bog. So we sit, and we listen, to this cockamamie story for over two hours and then what?  On Planet Texaco, the girl kisses the guy who tortured her friends.  Too on the nose?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," In one of the very few moments in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker where the action slows down for a second, the beloved droid C-3PO pauses to appreciate the heroic ensemble. “I’m just taking one last look at my friends,” he says. That kind of naked nostalgia is on display for every frantic minute of J. J. Abrams’s new film, the ninth and supposedly conclusive entry in the newly dubbed “Skywalker Saga” that George Lucas began with the first Star Wars in 1977. The gang’s all here—every new and old favorite character one could imagine—for an experience so convoluted and overstuffed that I wondered whether the whole cast would board a flying kitchen sink for the final battle. Abrams has long been a connoisseur of nostalgia, a director who blends viewers’ childhood pop-culture obsessions with just enough contemporary flavor to appeal to multigenerational audiences. His first Star Wars film, 2015’s The Force Awakens, was a splendid piece of mythmaking, a rewriting of the original film that washed away the sour taste left by Lucas’s bizarre (if memorable) prequel trilogy. Abrams has always excelled at origin stories, so while he was an ideal choice to launch the narratives of the new heroes Rey (played by Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac), and the antagonist Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), he does a much sloppier job of finishing their arcs. The Rise of Skywalker is, for want of a better word, completely manic: It leaps from plot point to plot point, from location to location, with little regard for logic or mood. The script, credited to Abrams and Chris Terrio, tries to tie up every dangling thread from The Force Awakens, delving into the origins of the villainous First Order, Rey’s mysterious background as an orphan on the planet Jakku, and even Poe’s occupation before signing up for the noble Resistance. The answer to a lot of these questions involves the ultra-villainous Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), the cackling, robed wizard-fascist behind the nefariousness of the first six films. I wish I could tell you every answer is satisfying, and that Abrams weaves the competing story interests of nine very different movies into one grand narrative, but he doesn’t even come close. As The Rise of Skywalker strives to explain just how the emperor, who died with explosive finality in 1983’s Return of the Jedi, is involved in this new saga, it neglects to do any work to ground its story in a more compelling and modern context. By contrast, The Force Awakens had the storytelling bones of the original Star Wars, but a cast of heroes who felt entirely unlike those who had come before; its follow-up, 2017’s The Last Jedi, did extraordinary work finding new angles on the themes of rebellion, oppression, and spiritual evolution in Lucas’s text. The Last Jedi, which was written and directed by Rian Johnson, surprised viewers partly because of how boldly it upended the narrative preconditions of Star Wars’ heroes and villains. It turned Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) into a grouchy wretch, had the brave Resistance fail every mission rather than stumble into a lifesaving deus ex machina, and yet it somehow managed to convey a tone of optimism for future generations of rebels. The Rise of Skywalker, conversely, is overly obsessed with the past, with Abrams perhaps thinking that tying the arcs of its heroes to decades-old films will somehow increase their significance. Instead, it heightens the incoherence. One prior film that The Rise of Skywalker seems keen to ignore is The Last Jedi, which is perhaps inevitable because Abrams is more invested in continuing the story he started with The Force Awakens. Charming characters from the last installment, such as Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), are sadly sidelined, and Johnson’s core argument about the irrelevance of the past has been swiftly forgotten. Instead, the new film features many monologues from the zombified emperor and an agreeable drop-in from one of the remaining unseen heroes of the original trilogy, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Abrams’s focus on those hallowed veterans extends to Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who is a significant presence in the film thanks to deleted scenes and movie trickery (Fisher, who is first-billed in the movie, died in 2016). As a longtime Star Wars devotee, I must admit that some of The Rise of Skywalker’s parade of reminiscence works its magic despite the mostly unintelligible plot. There are dancing light sabers and X-wings aplenty, with more sword battles and space dogfights than the last two films combined. That comes at the cost of the kinds of quieter character moments that remain lodged in my memory, such as Rey cheerfully donning a pilot’s helmet after she eats a lonely dinner in The Force Awakens, or Rose silently stroking her dead sister’s pendant in The Last Jedi. There simply isn’t time for much rumination in The Rise of Skywalker, even though the main plot amounts to little more than a video-gamey fetch quest that hops from planet to planet in search of magic doohickeys that will plot a course to the next set piece. New characters such as Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) get lost in the shuffle, although Richard E. Grant has as much fun as he can playing the First Order’s latest sneering general. Barring an apocalyptic event, The Rise of Skywalker won’t be the last Star Wars movie to grace the big screen. But it has the chance to be the last that’s really burdened by the legacy of George Lucas’s family-friendly adventure that took the world by surprise, a Flash Gordon revival that essentially invented a new kind of pop-culture blockbuster. The legacy and myth of the Skywalkers, the Vaders, and the Palpatines are in desperate need of retirement, and directors like Johnson have found a new way forward for this messy but lovable galaxy far, far away. The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting epitaph for the thrills and limits of repetition; may it be the last episode of a saga that should’ve ended long ago.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The Rise of Skywalker, the third proper entry in the Disney iteration of the hallowed Star Wars franchise, or its ninth “episode” depending on how much you care about this kind of thing, is a bit of an odd duck. Creatively a bit compromised from the outset, The Rise of Skywalker faced numerous challenges before making it to the big screen, both tragic (star Carrie Fisher’s death), necessitated (the firing of initial director Colin Trevorrow), and reactionary (fan furor over the Rian Johnson’s preceding The Last Jedi). With LucasFilm head Kathleen Kennedy navigating so many choppy waters, and the outright failures of the “Star Wars Story” spinoffs, it’s no wonder she returned to the steady hand of JJ Abrams, he who brought the franchise roaring back to life in the first place with the triumphant The Force Awakens. His return was seen as an opportunity to get things back to the median, and to close out the saga of Rey, Kylo Ren and others in a grand fashion, just as it started. The biggest risk, of course, in this kind of scenario is the potential for overcorrection; the idea that the preceding entry was far too radical that its revelations would need to be walked back zealously and reductively in an approach that veers towards the sort of “made by committee” filmmaking of the consistent but bland Marvel Studios. In truth, The Last Jedi was both revelatory and prosaic in equal measure. Severely overpraised by its adherents, and drug through the mud by those who felt as though it ruined the franchise (an ongoing complaint among the Star Wars faithful when their favorite toys are dented even remotely), The Last Jedi was a perfectly serviceable film that attempted to toss in a few new ideas into a fairly dusty franchise, at its best. But there’s something about the image of a zombified Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDirmond), resurrected from the dead and ordering Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) around, that acts as a better metaphor than one possibly could have imagined. Rather than letting old things die, they’re being resurrected and utilized to stuff a few other genies back in the bottle too…for better or worse. You see, the Emperor, attached to a pretty neat looking Giger-esque device that’s keeping him going, and stationed on what is basically the home planet of the Sith, has been the guy calling the shots all along. That guy in Kylo’s head? The Emperor. Snoke? The Emperor’s doing. And now he offers the former Ben Solo the opportunity to build his own Empire, utilizing an incredible fleet that the Emperor has been amassing since his fall. All he has to do? Kill Rey (Daisy Ridley), and the “Final Order” will commence. At the same time, Rey is training under General Leia (Fisher) to “truly earn” Luke’s (Mark Hamill) lightsaber, opening with a bit of a tossaway sequence constructed to make best use of the footage of Fisher they have on hand. While Rey is dealing with more esoteric concerns, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) continue the dirty work of fighting the First Order, and they learn that there is a spy within their enemy’s ranks. But their small victory is short-lived, as through that intel, they discover that the Emperor has returned. At that point, it becomes a race to get doodads here and other doodads there, so they can find the planet, in order to set up the inevitable confrontation of Jedi vs. Sith – what it always boils down to. It’s funny, for all the compliments the preceding film gets for its daring sense of ideas (did you know there isn’t just white and black? There’s also grey???), it’s actually Rise of Skywalker that I think produces the most interesting thematic throughline; the idea that your enemies thrive by making you think you’re alone in your ideals, but in reality, you outnumber them. That can be read a few different ways, and surely will be, but it smartly turns the ho-hum final note of The Last Jedi on its head and eventually into a rallying cry. Screenwriter Chris Terrio, who you might remember as the writer of the somewhat daring, somewhat idiotic Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, doesn’t quite address any of the hazy realpolitik of the universe, but he does at least give it just enough lip service that viewers can at least come to understand how those not representing one these two warring sides are affected in a larger sense. And from there, provides Poe with more character development and a greater three-dimensional nature than he’s had this entire series. He has a back story! And a kinda-sorta love interest! Played by Keri Russell no less! Finn, sadly, does not fare as well. On the bright side, he’s no longer saddled with a go-nowhere romance with Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran, who takes a deep backseat in this film), but on the other hand, he just returns to his puppy dog affection for Rey and gets very little else to do. It’s a shame, of all the new characters, Finn as a reformed Stormtrooper had the most promising potential arc. But as it turns out, he was cool idea that they didn’t know what else to do with. And then there’s Rey and Kylo, easily the most successful characters of the entire trilogy. They are once again intrinsically linked and in regular communicado, though with a good deal less understanding of one another. As you may have ascertained, Rey’s past once again plays a major role here, and there is some level of decision making that will deeply anger some fans, particularly as it quickly becomes the backbone of the film. While the revelations on hand are less severe than expected, it does speak to a sense of pacifying those fans who felt out of step with previous decision-making, and it’s difficult to not grimace a bit at the wrenching effort to get there. But Kylo? Easily the most gracefully handled character throughout, and the final turns of his arc are artfully handled, anchored by another sterling performance from Driver. But, this is a film, as with all entries of this series, one of set pieces. And to be frank, The Rise of Skywalker is littered with them just by virtue of the non-stop “fetch questing” that our heroes must go on. The script is so overstuffed with mythos, mystical items, and other side tangents, that it becomes one of the most bewildering experiences I’ve had within this universe. I knew once a mystical dagger was involved, trouble was brewing, and even as someone who has a Masters in Gobbledegook, I was getting completely lost in the weeds. On top of that, and this is where my disappointment in the film is perhaps clearest, the action is rather boring. While The Force Awakens was often tagged for its strict adherence to the structure of A New Hope, it still applied a beautiful new sheen with wide open vistas that made a viewer feel like they were sucked deeply into its various crevices and outerspace dog fights. But here? Everything just looks like a mess with no real definition of surroundings, and at points, my brain just turned off until the talking resumed. That’s not to say the film lacks for beauty, as the widest of wide-screen Abrams we know and love does creep out in scenes on the Sith homeworld and in a really lovely coastal planet visit towards the film’s middle. But everything else is drawn toward interior spaces, cramped hallways, and a small gathering space in the jungle. While it leaves you wondering if Abrams was attempting something different from his last effort, it just gives off a more claustrophobic vibe than something with the Star Wars label on the tin. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a messy, troubled film that offers just as much good as bad. It has far too much on its mind and is deeply concerned with the need for perceived course-correction for the franchise. While its flaws are evident, it never quite derails, and its high points pull it back from the brink that it’s continually threatening to careen off of, with each misguided idea quickly being replaced by something a bit more thrilling. It’s not the exceptional closer to the sequel trilogy that we all hoped for, but it gets the job done.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The story isn’t perfect, the reanimated Leia is weird and the Emperor is a pantomime villain – but who cares when you’re skipping along at lightspeed? About 40 minutes into Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker there’s a little switcheroo where you think that Chewbacca has died. And I believed it. I mean, it’s the last of the sequel-trilogy, the last of this particular nine-film story arc, and important characters have died already. But Chewie? Could they really kill Chewie? No, thank the Maker, they (by “they” we mean JJ Abrams, co-screenwriter Chris Terrio and Luscasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy) did not. In fact, it’s only one more scene (maybe two, keep in mind I was seeing white hot when I thought my Wookiee pal had bought it) until you see Chewbacca alive, and growling with such ferocity it blows the hair back on Domhnall Gleeson’s General Hux. And that, I think, is the overall message of “Episode IX”. All the toys go back where they are supposed to go at the end. The movie snaps together like a jigsaw puzzle, a series of concluding beats that seem inevitable and perfect, and designed to please all parties, so long as you don’t dwell on the logic too much. Moreover, Chewbacca finally gets that medal denied him by Princess Leia in the throne room of the Great Temple of Yavin a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away (1977, when Star Wars was a risky film venture from hot shot director George Lucas after American Graffiti, not a project dripping with toy and merchandise opportunities). In 2015, I had the good fortune to see Lucas chat with Stephen Colbert at the Tribeca film festival. Lucas is an unusual person, to say the least. Among other things, he still claims that he spends his days tinkering on “experimental films” to show his friends so they can laugh at him. But something stayed with me from that afternoon. His primary artistic vision, the words he kept using to express the engine that drives him, is “going fast”. Speed, more than narrative coherence, may just be his greatest legacy of all. To that end, JJ Abrams is truly his Padawan. The same, I saw Colbert chat with Abrams at the Montclair film festival in New Jersey. During that talk Abrams confessed he knew that the orange foam that dissolved the metal van in Mission: Impossible III was bunk science, but only cared that it looked amazing, and it would zoom by so quickly no one would care. The two touched back on this point a few times, turning it into a punchline. Never in Abrams’s career has he relied on this methodology more than in The Rise of Skywalker, which doesn’t just open with lightspeed but “lightspeed-skipping”. The Millennium Falcon zaps across the galaxy, baddies in tow, zipping through multiple blue tunnels of subspace, with Poe, Finn and Chewie cracking wise, TIE-fighters on their tail. A plane of sharp asteroids! A sky full of tall, narrow towers! An enormous space slug ready to gobble them up! John Williams’s score crashes along with them and, yes, this is what they mean when they say “this movie made me feel like a kid again”. Each newly glimpsed setting is gorgeous and the thrill is tangible. Later Rey chastises them. The Falcon, apparently, can’t lightspeed-skip. But it just did, because our team is the best team! Why bother complaining? Abrams’s attempt, with this film, to tie all of Star Wars lore in a bow isn’t perfect. A visitation from a dead spirit is classic to the series, but The Rise of Skywalker has two nearly back-to-back moments that deaden the emotional impact of one another. I wish that there was a little more air in between these scenes. Also, Carrie Fisher is in the movie more than I thought she would be, and I have to say it is weird. Maybe it’s just because I know her appearances are reanimated from the discarded takes of previous films with computer tech that could land a person on Mars, but I wish it was one scene, not many. To the writers’ credit, the script, surely reverse-engineered to match whatever footage they had, basically makes sense. It’s a one-time miracle, but I hope nothing like this ever happens again. There are plenty of winks to the original series, but we’re swimming in that at the moment thanks to the current (and terrific) TV series The Mandalorian. What The Rise of Skywalker does, which some may dislike, is whip the Emperor (AKA Senator Sheev Palpatine AKA Darth Sidious) out of nowhere and use him as a crutch to answer the question of Rey’s heritage. To this I say: sure, whatever. What worked really well, though, is how Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel shoot Ian McDiarmid like a Hammer horror villain, interior lighting casting shadows on his face. He’s hanging from a jib for some reason, in a pit you can only access by going under an enormous cube on a planet hidden by a cosmic storm. Star Wars! While Palpatine’s lair looks incredible, it makes absolutely no sense that if Rey strikes the Emperor down on his command she will go to the Dark Side, but if she does so 10 minutes later she will be the hero of the galaxy. But this is what happens, and it works because the momentum of the movie makes it so. It’s all too fast and too neat looking to give you a chance to question it. So I cheered. I can’t explain it, but I cheered. Being a Star Wars fan has, of late, become weirdly factional. A small but extremely vocal subgroup have harassed Rian Johnson, writer-director of The Last Jedi, and some of the new actors his chapter brought in, namely Kelly Marie Tran. Their actions are upsetting and ridiculous, and it has understandably inspired others to protest in favour of the middle film. But even the defensiveness has become extreme. I am glad, in a way, that this is all over now, and hope that, in time, that chatter will seem distant, and we can enjoy these extremely entertaining and marvellously designed films for what they are: rich, nerdy fun with very basic plots a child can follow. Also, Chewbacca is my favourite.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," There was so much promise in the new Star Wars trilogy. A young, fresh, likable cast of characters was brought in to interact with classic characters. The legacy lived on. The excitement was palpable, and even when missteps were made, there was a real sense that we were experiencing blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. And that makes Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker all the more heartbreaking. What started so promisingly with The Force Awakens and reached exciting heights with The Last Jedi ends in almost unthinkable disappointment. What should have been the big, triumphant conclusion to the Skywalker Saga has instead ended with plenty of sound and fury signifying nothing. When J.J. Abrams returned to helm The Rise of Skywalker, there was some question as to how he would treat the events of the trilogy entry he didn't direct, The Last Jedi. Rian Johnson's Force Awakens follow-up famously refused to explore many of the dangling storylines Abrams set-up, instead trying to take the saga into uncharted waters. Leading up to the release of Skywalker, Abrams was asked again and again by interviewers: would he ignore The Last Jedi? Abrams swore he would not, and as it turns out, he was telling the truth. The Rise of Skywalker does take into account the events of Jedi. But here's the curious thing: at the same time, the movie feels weirdly disconnected from not just The Last Jedi but from Abrams' own Force Awakens as well. The Rise of Skywalker is like its own little satellite, hurtling off through space on a chaotic orbit. Even though we spend the entirety of the film with characters we've grown to know and love, they all feel adrift, and worse, underserved. When Avengers: Endgame, another huge blockbuster conclusion, arrived earlier this year, there was a true sense that the journey with these particular characters had come to an end. Sure, there will still be Marvel movies, just like there will still be Star Wars movies. But for all its flaws, Endgame felt like a well-earned final act – the big, celebratory curtain call that the saga deserved. There's nothing even approaching that in The Rise of Skywalker, which aims to be not just a conclusion to this new trilogy, but to the so-called Skywalker Saga as a whole. This movie should leave you feeling as if you've completed a spectacular journey. Instead, The Rise of Skywalker simply irises out to show Abrams' directorial credit, and you wonder, ""Is that it?"" As Rise of Skywalker kicks-off, the Resistance is still struggling to stay afloat while the First Order continues to grow stronger. But there might be hope! There's a spy inside the First Order funneling info to the Resistance, which is good news. But there's bad news, too: the Emperor is back. The Rise of Skywalker announces the villain's unlikely return in the opening crawl with appropriately pulpy text, all in caps, crying out: ""THE DEAD SPEAK!"" It's exactly the type of silly-but-fun set-up the hard-to-swallow return of a clearly deceased character deserves. Unfortunately, Skywalker tanks that goodwill rather quickly, rushing through a convoluted storyline that's painfully clunky, chock-full of eye-rolling exposition that's bound to give you a headache. There's an organic way to lay out all the details on display here, but screenwriters Abrams and Chris Terrio haven't cracked it. Instead, they have the characters shuttle off from one planet to the next where they promptly meet one new character after another who proceeds to give them a speech about just what the hell is going on. Naomi Ackie and Keri Russell make the most of two of these parts, but their characters are so woefully underwritten that they may as well not be in the movie at all. What keeps The Rise of Skywalker from tanking completely is the cast. For the first time since this trilogy began, our main heroes spend most of the bulk of the story together. Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) is more powerful than ever, but her self-doubt is immense. Meanwhile, pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance Fighter Finn (John Boyega) are ready to hop in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and fight. General Leia – the late Carrie Fisher, appearing here via archival footage that sadly always seems unnatural and shoehorned in – sends the gang on a mission to find what amounts to a glowing GPS that might as well be called The Macguffin Crystal. Elsewhere in the galaxy, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is now the Supreme Leader, and he's hellbent on tracking down Rey. But like Rey, Kylo is conflicted. He may be fully engulfed in the Dark Side, but his connection to Rey has him flummoxed. These two crazy kids are drawn to each other, whether they like it or not. And how does the Emperor fit into all of this? You'll have to wait and see, but know this: it's not at all satisfying – or even that interesting. What is satisfying: the performances. Ridley continues to be the MVP of this saga, bringing raw humanity to her part that makes Rey so likable. Abrams knows just how to frame Ridley's face, too, so that her very large eyes do most of the talking without the actress having to speechify. Boyega and Isaac make a wonderful pair, and the duo gets to trade barbs back and forth like they're in a screwball comedy. And Driver's Kylo Ren continues to be the most fascinating villain in the history of the franchise – he's like an exposed wire spitting sparks while his frame is somehow both lanky and hulking, his face a mask of conflicted anger. Will Rise of Skywalker entertain the crowds? Probably! Its action is fairly non-stop, approaching Michael Bay levels at times, and that keeps the film from being boring. Plus there are several big setpieces that manage to thrill, especially a lightsaber battle on top of some space wreckage located in the midst of monstrous, crashing waves. But there's so much wasted potential here. As the story draws to its big, loud climax, and one fan-service moment after another arises, you begin to get the sense that Abrams is just checking off boxes and fulfilling a quota. There's no spark; no joy; no life. If this truly is the end of the Skywalker Saga, what an ignoble end it is.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Has The Rise of Skywalker been five years in the making, or 35? At this point, Star Wars is baked into our cultural fabric, a fundamental tenet of people’s childhoods, with strong opinions all around. It’s hard to even evaluate them as stories; they’re myths, legends, inextricably tied to the egos and identities of many a purveyor of nerd culture (which, of course, is now mainstream culture in all the good and bad ways that entails).  With the end movie of a trilogy of trilogies that have proven so important to, let’s face it, most people around the world, how do you even go out? For people who live and breathe Star Wars trivia, who eat up Extended Universe novels like nobody’s business and know who Dash Rendar is, The Rise of Skywalker might serve as a warm, fuzzy blanket filled with continuity porn and all the callbacks you could possibly ask for. But its desperate, almost pathological desire to cater to the broadest common denominator of Star Wars fans is also its biggest downfall. The furor over 2017’s The Last Jedi has been raging on longer than this website has been alive, so I’ll spare the details. But suffice to say, everyone who held hatred for Rian Johnson’s more deconstructionist take on the universe (rational or no) will likely be pleased with J.J. Abrams‘ return to the pilot’s chair. Virtually everything Jedi dared to do different is ignored or outright apologized for — Rey’s potential parentage is more important than ever, Kylo’s helmet is back, and characters who learned from failure walked back from those perspectives.  Hate Rose (Kelly Marie Tran)? Don’t worry, we’ll Jar Jar her this time around, relegating her to background exposition as a Resistance flunky. Crave a deeper dive into the emotional underpinnings of its characters, or the sociopolitics of one of the most vibrant science fiction universes in fiction? Too bad; settle for two and a half hours of dreadfully straightforward exposition and paint-by-numbers plotting.  So much of the story feels like a deliberate response to the divisive reaction of The Last Jedi, a good deal of which (though not all) was due to the more toxic elements of the fandom. As such, a lot of the verve and personality of the new trilogy feels lost: Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) feel less like new characters forging their own destiny than action figures being bounced through decades-old playsets. That sense of grave-digging through the past extends to the story too, a multi-part chase along multiple planets to track down a series of MacGuffins that might lead to a secret Imperial fleet, and the key to winning the war against intergalactic sadboi Kylo Ren  (Adam Driver) and the First Order.  To say more would spoil things, but suffice to say the only major things I could be spoiling are things you’ve seen, in some form or another, in the original trilogy. Old planets, obscure characters, and specific moments from the OT are cribbed wholesale, and not even in that Force Awakens-style homage kind of way: the film practically winks at you, jabs you in the ribs, and says “hey… remember this? We promise we won’t take risks again. We know how much you hate that.” If it sounds like I’m being hard on the movie, it’s because I am. Like Force Awakens, a good deal of Rise of Skywalker works in that slapdash, energy-of-the-moment J.J. Abrams way. Characters shout, quip, talk over each other and run from setpiece to setpiece with reckless abandon (in the first act, especially, the pacing might even be too quick), and the action is occasionally handsomely presented. It lacks the visual punch of The Last Jedi (Abrams’ compositions veer perilously close to TV-show territory), but it gets the job done. And John Williams‘ score is as iconic as ever, even if it gets too self-consciously callback-y in that bloated final act.  But the key to it all, like it was in Force Awakens, is the essential chemistry of its young cast, Rise of Skywalker working best when it zeroes in on the central Finn-Poe-Rey dynamic the previous two films lacked. While the last two films got their fair share of character mileage out of their separate journeys, it’s a delight to see them as a fully-formed team, bouncing off each other with winsome energy. Isaac remains a capable lead, and Boyega finally gets to shine as well now that Finn’s character is a bit more established.  But it’s Ridley who feels most fully formed here, even as revised plot revelations turn her into more of a tool for franchise-building than a three-dimensional character of her own. As for Driver, he feels a bit more reined in here (mostly due to their decision to keep him in the mask), but his concluding moments as a character offer the closest thing this film gets to true risktaking.  There’s a lot more I could include in this review, like how the film doesn’t truly have time for its bevy of new supporting characters, like Keri Russell and Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant, or even the old ones like Billy Dee Williams and the late Carrie Fisher (her role cobbled together from unused Force Awakens clips, and boy does it show).  Sure, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) comes closest to a kind of character arc, but don’t expect many seemingly-permanent sacrifices to truly stick for long.  I could also go on about the film’s transparent, cynical pandering to a fanbase that cares more about cataloging Wookieepedia minutiae than trying something new with their toys. And who knows? Maybe my opinion on it will even soften after a second viewing.  But as it currently stands, The Rise of Skywalker feels like a coward’s move — a refusal to double down on more audacious storytelling ideas in exchange for dipping into the warm, empty embrace of familiarity. It ties up the franchise in a neat, tidy bow, to be sure. But it does so at the cost of its personality.  Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Not that long ago in a galaxy near and dear to us, J.J. Abrams brilliantly re-packaged our Star Wars memories as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi took an opposite approach two years later, bringing a challenging and welcome nerve that sent a clear signal it would soon be time to move on. Abrams is back as director and co-writer to close the saga with The Rise of Skywalker, which ends up feeling less like a course correction (which wasn’t needed) and more like a sly meeting of both minds. The fan service is strong with this one, indeed, though it never quite smacks of panicked fanboy appeasement. In fact, the echoes of Johnson’s vision only make Abrams’s franchise love letter more emotionally resonant. We were told this goodbye was coming, and now here it is, so grab hold of something. And that doesn’t mean just tissues (though you may need them), as Abrams delivers action that comes early and more than often. From deep space shootouts to light saber duals amid monstrous ocean waves, the heart-racing set pieces are damn near non stop and seldom less than spectacular. We knew their fates would collide, we wanted that collision, and here we get it, propelled by two actors in Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver who are able to fully embrace the weight of their respective arcs. As all our questions are eventually answered, Driver and Ridley never let us forget what drives their characters: the closure of identity. And from a new hope to the last hope, it is precisely those bloodlines and destinies that have always driven this entire franchise. Abrams makes sure he honors that legacy with a satisfying sendoff bursting with fandom in nearly every frame.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The dead don’t die. Everything old is new again. Characters in the galaxy imagined by George Lucas in 1977’s “Star Wars” may believe that balance is achievable, but in real life such a thing seems all but impossible. Lucas and his teams managed amazing feats of plate-spinning with “Star Wars” and, against all odds, “The Empire Strikes Back.” Beginning with the kid- and merchandise-friendly “Return of the Jedi” in 1983, however, and continuing through two new primary trilogies, the “Star Wars” movies have struggled to find the same equilibrium. Decades later, the true nature of these movies descended from early adventure serials is still debatable. Is “Star Wars: a new cultural mythology, a framework to interrogate our own reliance on familiar entertainment, or a series of movies primarily aimed at kids, with enough flash and spectacle to appeal to adults? “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” ditches any semblance of balance. This movie accepts, even embraces, that “Star Wars” is fundamentally a series of movies for kids — and, in this case, not necessarily an artfully crafted one. This “final” chapter in the Skywalker Saga is a long, propulsive and messy chase movie that sends characters scrambling after one McGuffin or another and the dramatic results vary at best. Maybe Rey (Daisy Ridley) will learn something new about her family; perhaps Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) will strive to reconcile his own family history with the buzzing school-shooter anger that fuels his vendettas. Mostly, Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flit from one planet to another, bickering and cracking jokes while blasting Stormtroopers and evading the dogged and evil First Order. After a bold opening crawl which establishes that (as suggested by trailers) the Emperor has already returned, the movie settles into a familiar, not-all-that challenging rhythm. Director J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio focus on the same sort of nostalgia-inducing images and character combinations that inflated “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” in 2015. (Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow, who developed an earlier version of the movie, get story credit alongside Abrams and Terrio.) There’s a First Order officer, played with pitch-perfect venom by Richard E. Grant, who could have been in any of the original trilogy films (a pity he wasn’t in this series from the jump). There’s a Force Ghost and a couple of familiar ships and more than a few returning faces — some expected, like Billy Dee Williams, reprising Lando Calrissian, and some not. In its best moments — of which there aren’t that many — the nostalgia tricks work almost as well as in “Star Wars” and “The Empire Strikes Back.” ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ doesn’t raise any new themes or ideas; it isn’t about anything that wasn’t already set in motion by previous films. However, as dicey as it all is narratively, Abrams & co. milk earnest thrills out of acts of unity writ large, and find a corny emotional buoyancy in heartfelt reunions. And yet there’s the puzzling decision to use outtakes of the late Carrie Fisher to keep General Leia Organa in the story for as long as possible. While cleverly reverse-engineer integrated into the story, these moments ultimately never seem like anything other than scrap riffs awkwardly remixed into a would-be hit single. Fisher’s first appearance in the film is as a head floating awkwardly on a digital body, and Leia’s dialogue is uniformly vague and disconnected. The overall effect would be wholly ghoulish were it not for Fisher’s unique charm. To many, this movie will feel like a jarring experience coming on the heels of Rian Johnson‘s ‘The Last Jedi,’ which attempted to unpack and deconstruct all the bits and pieces of ‘Star Wars’ mythology in order to push the story into new territory. Johnson tried to look forward as steadfastly as Abrams looks back, but here Abrams has the last word. All the big narrative and thematic swings of ‘The Last Jedi’ are undermined or undone by this story to an almost heartbreakingly disappointing level. Killing ‘Star Wars’ so that it could live was neat, but ultimately, nostalgia won; looking back is the path forward. This is a world of black and white; gone are the grey and Earth-colored robes of Luke Skywalker in ‘The Last Jedi.’ There is little nuance, or reflection, only a desire to lean on the joke and the setpieces that worked before. Nothing George Lucas did was new. It was all cribbed from Kurosawa and Ford and Joseph Campbell and “Flash Gordon,” but he put bits together in a way that at least looked fresh. His influences weren’t “Star Wars.” While “The Rise of Skywalker” draws from a few different sources — George Miller‘s “Mad Max” movies, Alejandro Jodorowsky‘s “El Topo,” and even (seriously) “Hellraiser II,” in one appealingly nightmarish look at the resurrected Emperor Palpatine — most of this movie’s influences are other “Star Wars” movies. The serpent is choking on its own tail. This is fan fiction on the largest possible scale. Abrams’ decision to undo Johnson’s attempts to boldly tear down and reinvent “Star Wars” plus his refusal to truly push the story in any new direction limits its scope and makes it all feel like he’s playing in someone else’s sandbox. Perhaps this is the entertainment landscape we’ve made for ourselves by accepting or applauding franchises like “Halloween” and “The Terminator” as they willfully disregard storytelling efforts that are deemed less than ideal. In those two examples, many of the erased storylines are years and even decades old. This Star Wars movie races to dismantle ‘The Last Jedi’s ideas as quickly as possible.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," Legacy is at the heart of the Star Wars saga, and JJ Abrams, who returns to directing duties for the final instalment, knows it. As with The Force Awakens, The Rise of Skywalker pays homage to what came before, offering a safe but satisfying conclusion to the space opera that began back in 1977. Given the ire directed by more militant fans at Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, Abrams’ approach appears to be to steer the ship in a direction that will not result in Reddit forums calling for his film to be struck from the canon. To repair the perceived problems of the previous instalment, there’s an exposition-heavy opening. In a blur of short scenes, Abrams bombards us with numerous narrative threads, setting up a new adventure that has little in common with the previous episode. We soon learn that in the galaxy far, far away, breaking with tradition is not for this director. From the opening scroll, we learn that Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) and the Rebellion are continuing the fight against the First Order. Rey (Daisy Ridley), meanwhile, is honing her Jedi skills until Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) tempts her to the dark side with knowledge of her heritage, after a message is transmitted across the galaxy purporting to be from a shadowy figure from the past. As with The Force Awakens, the chief weapon in Abrams’ arsenal is nostalgia. Whether it’s familiar faces or trips back to iconic locations, Abrams uses every possible opportunity to hark back to George Lucas's original trilogy. Some of Abrams’ tricks are wielded as elegantly as a lightsabre; others are more like sporadic blaster fire, hoping to hit you in your heart. The Rise of Skywalker is best when it’s at its most eulogistic. As a fond farewell to a story that began over forty years ago, Abrams succeeds in his mission. This is particularly true of the quieter moments that are less focused on the overly-packed plot, although at times the film does get bogged down in providing unnecessary answers or following the arcs of the previous films. Nonetheless, Abrams gives it one last epic push, delivering grand setpieces, derring-do duels, and a classic tale of good versus evil that ups the ante on every previous instalment. Is there too much fan service? Perhaps. Abrams is eager to give fanboys what they want, but it’s always on his terms. His treatment of old favourites, like Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) provide some of the most heartwarming moments. But it is the late Carrie Fisher as Leia who is best served. While initial scenes made up of filmed material from previous instalments are uneven, Abrams honours the legacy of her most famous character, showing that she is as worthy of the Skywalker name as Luke ever was, and perhaps even more so.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," 42 years after it began, in 1977, the Star Wars saga comes to an end. Or rather, the original series, as envisioned by progenitor George Lucas, does so. Who knows, after all, what further adventures set “a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away” the folks at Disney – who now own Star Wars– have in mind? Whatever comes, that doesn’t change the fact that Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker concludes the story of siblings Luke and Leia, and their many friends. Good or bad, the film is a landmark. Since it is more good than bad, though hardly exceptional, let’s call it an acceptable final chapter. Given the horror show of the prequels – or episodes I, II and III, as they are called – it could have been worse, even if it could also have been better. All the new characters, present in one or both of the last two movies (Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Star Wars: The Last Jedi), along with older stalwarts like Luke Skywalker (who died last time, but the Force is strong in that one), Leia Organa, Chewbacca and droids C-3PO and R2-D2, among others. To briefly recap, when last we left our protagonists, villain Kylo Ren had succeeded in consolidating his hold over the First Order, even if he was frustrated in his further ambitions to recruit young Jedi apprentice Rey over to the dark side. The rebels took a hit but lived to fight another day. Now there is an even greater threat to the universe, as the opening crawl announces that Emperor Palpatine, the sinister Sith Lord behind the chaos of Episodes I-VI, is back, somehow not quite dead, if also not quite alive. His gathering armies need only a vibrant leader to wipe out all resistance, and Kylo Ren is just the man for the job. Kylo is game, but would prefer to do it together with Rey, with whom he has a strange, mystical bond that both attracts and repels. Will she fight off the temptation to join him in evil, especially once he reveals the truth of her origins? That’s the question. Though extremely powerful, Rey can’t do battle entirely on her own, and so her trusty, able-bodied friends (and one would-be lover) Poe, Finn, Chewbacca, C-3PO and fellow droid BB-8 all tag along to help her find and stop Palpatine before he launches a deadly offensive against the rebels. They’re a wily bunch, but so are Kylo Ren and his henchmen. Who will get to the undead emperor first, and what will happen once they do? Hopefully, the fun is in the finding out. The film, helmed by J.J. Abrams, who also directed The Force Awakens, is eminently watchable, and without the unfortunate bloat of the The Last Jedi, yet somehow never quite rises to a level that would elevate this final trilogy to greatness. There’s promise in the strong performances from Adam Driver (Marriage Story) as Kylo Ren and Daisy Ridley (Ophelia) as Rey, and some marvelous special effects in certain sequences (my favorite is a lightsaber battle on the ruined Death Star, ocean waves crashing on the ramparts), yet too much illogical silliness on the sidelines that takes away from the raw power of the best scenes. I’m not talking about the humor (always welcome), but the dramatic laziness that infects much of the screenplay, whether it’s rebels fighting on the exterior hull of an imperial star cruiser (uh, air, anyone?), improbably lax First Order security that allows Poe and Finn to land in the bay of said star cruiser, or any number of odd behaviors on the part of ostensibly smart villains that allow our heroes an easy win. That, and the addition of awesome new Force-based powers that we’ve never seen before (conveniently appearing when most needed), merely serve to remind us that consistency and coherence are no one’s priority. Worse, the once essential Finn (John Boyega) is reduced to a lot of mooning after Rey, the woman it looks like he will never have, while she has eyes only for Kylo Ren, the man she shouldn’t have. Poe (Oscar Isaac) gets a more sizeable part, but at the end is still just a sidekick. Both tower, however, over poor Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), so vital in The Last Jedi and here all but forgotten. Yes, there are many wasted opportunities.  For the rest, though Carrie Fisher died before the release of the previous movie, she is back as Leia, presumably having filmed all her scenes before her demise (and she’s fine), and Mark Hamill (also good) returns as Luke. Even better, Billy Dee Williams shows up to reprise his role as Lando Calrissian. Harrison Ford, whose Han Solo died in The Force Awakens, pops up, as well. The gang is all here, in other words, to say farewell, in what amounts to a rousing, if sloppy, finish. It’s moving, at times, but also somewhat forgettable. The nostalgia is strong, even if the narrative force is weak. Christopher Llewellyn Reed is a film critic, filmmaker, and educator, as well as Film Festival Today's Editor.

"Dec 18, 2019"," This, the third episode of
the third “Star Wars” trilogy, brings the saga that began more than four
decades ago to a close, resolving the plotlines of its two immediate
predecessors—and the nine-movie series as a whole—while creating a springboard
for inevitable continuations and spinoffs. 
What else would you expect from a picture that Disney is banking on to
ensure a long future for one of its most important franchises? As you might remember,
“The Last Jedi,” which split Star Wars fandom rather badly, ended with the
surviving members of the Resistance, led by heroic Rey (Daisy Ridley) and
Princess (or General) Leia (Carrie Fisher), on the run from the evil First
Order, the leadership of which had been seized by Han Solo and Princess Leia’s
wayward son Ben, aka Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who patterned himself after Darth
Vader. But there’s a wild card in
the deck: as the usual opening crawl informs us, mysterious broadcasts have
announced the return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who was supposedly
killed by Darth Vader in “The Return of the Jedi” back when Luke Skywalker
(Mark Hamill) was just a youngster; he’s rebuilding Sith power and plans to
restore his dark rule. The reports turn out to be true, and Palpatine, with his
lightning-launching fingers and maniacal cackling, turns out to be a major
figure here—so much so that a more appropriate subtitle for the movie might be
“The Emperor Strikes Back.” There’s also a
genealogical revelation intended to be as much of a shock as the famous one at
the close of “The Empire Strikes Back,” as well as more than the usual quota of
reversals, double-crosses, hair’s-breadth escapes and dramatic
self-sacrifices.  Expect also the
obligatory moment when Rey decides to abandon her destiny; the character who
recalls her to her sense of duty trumpets a line that seems to be something of
a rebuke by Abrams to narrative choices made by Rain Johnson in
“Jedi”—decisions to which many fans vociferously objected. The culmination of all the
hullabaloo, of course, is twofold.  One
part is a confrontation with Palpatine in his gloomy, cavernous throne room, an
amphitheatre where he’s apparently surrounded perpetually by an army of
cheering acolytes (the crowd looks enormous in distant CGI shots, less so in
the rather puny close-ups).  Whom he’s
facing will not be revealed here, but McDiarmid certainly takes the opportunity
to have the once (and perhaps future) emperor chew the scenery with unmitigated
glee—though perhaps the phrase is misplaced, since the poor old fellow doesn’t
seem to have any teeth, just that oily black fluid sloshing around in his mouth. Then there’s the
complementary battle in the sky between Palpatine’s vast armada and the ragtag
group of fighters on the Resistance side. 
Will our heroes be able to overcome the might of the planet-destroying
starships?  Will reinforcements arrive in
time, or at all?  What do you think?  You can’t say that Abrams
and co-writer Chris Terrio haven’t aimed to hit all the bases in their
summing-up project.  In the process
they’ve scrimped somewhat on the humor: the bickering among the principals,
especially Poe and Finn, has a rather pro forma feel, and even C3-PO’s
complaints are sometimes forced.  There’s
also a tendency to lay on the sentiment rather thick.  Worse, they tend to ignore the responsibility
to explain basic questions—how did this character escape, why didn’t that one do
this, how is this guy still alive?—while allowing other elements (like
Palpatine’s protracted revelations about his plans) to drag on needlessly.  By the close you will probably be adding up
plot holes in your mind even as the credits roll. Abrams also gets committed
performances from his cast, especially Ridley, who has to do most of the heavy
dramatic lifting, and Driver, who tries to bring some real anguish to the
conflicted Kylo Ren.  Except for
McDiarmid, whose outlandish villainy would make Ming the Merciless envious, the
others give mostly utilitarian performances, though it’s amusing to see Grant
doing what amounts to a snooty homage to Peter Cushing, who isn’t digitally
resurrected this time around. Despite all the efforts of
cast and crew, “The Rise of Skywalker” doesn’t recapture the almost magical
vibe that “A New Hope” (as it was retitled) and “The Empire Strikes Back” did
in their time.  But it’s really
unrealistic to expect it to.  With those
films George Lucas initiated a retro type of Hollywood storytelling, refreshed
with up-to-date technical wizardry, that’s now become the norm: every tentpole
movie the studios turn out unrelentingly today is a descendent of “Star
Wars.”   One can’t blame Abrams for not
being able to duplicate the spirit of juvenile rediscovery that seemed fresh in
1977.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The Rise of Skywalker is a lot, emotionally. It’s a lot. Episode IX is the end of the Skywalker saga, so whenever there is an end, there is emotion. Is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker kid friendly? Parents need to be most concerned about the violence and the evil scary components. This non-spoiler The Rise of Skywalker movie review is going to be short, because you can’t say much without spoiling anything. However, just because your kids saw the other Star Wars movies, doesn’t mean they need to see this one in theaters.  In Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the surviving Resistance faces the First Order once more as Rey, Finn and Poe’s journey continues. With the power and knowledge of generations behind them, the final battle commences. Will you get answers in The Rise of Skywalker? Yes, you will, but that doesn’t mean you’ll like them.  That also doesn’t mean your child will like them. Is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker safe for kids? I would not recommend it for kids under 8. However, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is generally ok for kids who have seen every single Star Wars movie. I don’t think there’s anyway to stop them from seeing it, but once again, be mindful of the emotional heaviness and darkness. There are a few bad words like a**, damn, and hell. I think I counted a total of six, so profanity is light for a PG-13 movie. This is where Star Wars movies get their PG-13 rating from…violence and action, albeit sci-fi violence. Yes, there is a ton of violence in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker from the opening sequence to the end of the movie which may effect little kids who are sensitive to seeing their friends get hurt. The action never stops and some of that includes death. There are also some close-up shots of the violence which makes it feel more real. Sometimes blasters and lightsabers soften the blow, which aren’t weapons you see on the street besides Disney World and Comic Cons. Be aware of some scary creatures and tense moments. Episode IX is heavy. People were crying in the theater, myself included. There are plenty of emotional moments; don’t try to guess them. Emotionally, I would say it ranges between Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Rogue One.  This is always a hard question for me to answer, because only you know your child and how they handle different situations. With a running time of 2 hours and 22 minutes, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will be long for kids 8 and under. It’s mostly action-packed, but there are some lulls where scenes could have been shorter.  I recommend Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker for kids 10 and up, and it’s safe for kids younger than that if they are huge Star Wars fans and are used to Star Wars content. I would increase the age recommendation to ages 12 and older if they don’t like the Harry Potter movies. Strange comment, yes, but if they don’t like that creepy, Sith-type feel, then maybe watch this one at home. There’s some Voldemort-like parts.  I don’t know. It’s violent, it’s creepy, but it’s also funny and was made for the fans! There’s a lot of fan service – meaning, yes you’ll get some nods to old Star Wars quotes like “Never underestimate a droid.” J.J. Abrams was never going to please everybody; Star Wars fans are too volatile, but you have to judge for yourself.  The new Star Wars characters like Jannah, Zorri Bliss, D-O, and Babu Frik are scene stealers and fun additions to the Star Wars family! If you don’t love Babu Frik as much as you love Baby Yoda, then I’m not sure about humanity anymore. Honestly, I’m happy to see more female Star Wars characters making appearances.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will not satisfy everyone. It’s not without fault and a bit all over the place trying to answer questions from a trilogy that never seems to know where its going. The Mandalorian will probably satisfy more Star Wars purists. However, J.J. Abrams does a beautiful job of restoring hope to a fan base and world that need it, unless you’re cynical, then not even Obi-Wan can help you.  Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is family friendly and will be a great addition for older kids and parents to add to the holiday line-up. Restoring hope? I didn't eat for three days because the movie was so senseless and tragic. The prodigal son dies and the heroine has to live the rest of her life without her soulmate. I don't know how a movie could be more hopeless, cynical, and devoid of joy and light.  I don't know that Kylo Ren was Rey's soulmate, but I do agree that it's a mature movie. As far as hope, it still gave me hope that the Resistance carries on for good even amongst the tragedy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," This one, of course, also brings back The Force Awakens director JJ Abrams. He’s now the closest thing the saga has to a safe pair of hands, someone who might be able to stick the landing, especially after Rian Johnson’s efforts to shake things up with The Last Jedi enraged all the fanboys. Abrams doesn’t waste any time either, adopting George Lucas’s infamous “faster, more intense” directorial style as a kind of creative mantra and finding ways to playfully admonish Johnson for disrespecting the saga’s iconography after he went to all the trouble of setting things up for him with the first of these sequels. Following the traditional opening scroll, The Rise of Skywalker sees him racing through scenes like an Ewok on a speeder bike, catching us up on the intertwined fates of Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Sith-Lord-in-waiting Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and cross-cutting their storylines with Resistance heroes Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) as they embark on a dangerous mission with Chewbacca to make contact with a First Order spy believed to have crucial intel about the resurgence of Ian McDiarmid’s thought-to-be-dead Emperor Palpatine.  That’s about as much plot info as can be divulged in a review, but suffice to say that by the movie’s end, all the big questions — especially about Rey’s parentage and her special bond with Kylo Ren — will be answered, with the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia also playing a crucial part in proceedings thanks to clever use of outtakes from the previous instalment. It’s certainly nice to see the real Fisher here rather than some ghoulish CG approximation. That said, the sheer number of callbacks to earlier films in the series — some of them admittedly delightful (and one a pure grin-inducing joy) — does reveal something telling about Abrams’ inability to craft iconic moments of his own. The pleasingly weird inter-dimensional confrontations between Rey and Ren aside, there’s a frustrating absence of dramatic tension through out and that lack of genuine engagement in the story can’t simply be offset with the heavily hyped reintroduction of legacy characters such as Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019","Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a fitting last movie. It's long; maddening; fun in bits; fantastic in parts; and so desperate to stir itself into legend that we urge it on, like parents screaming at their tots in an egg-and-spoon race.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," There’s a moment at the end of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope that helps us understand where the series is at today, and how it got here. Fresh off the Rebel Alliance’s impossible victory, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) bestows gold medals to Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). By blowing up the Death Star, Luke and Han stopped The Empire dead in its tracks. Cool right? The problem is that Han’s co-pilot and best friend, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), also risked his shaggy ass fighting The Empire. And guess what? Chewie is standing right there with the guys, but nobody gives him a medal. It’s not like a 7”3 Wookiee wearing a bandolier around his chest is easy to miss. Seen through 2019’s super-woke lens, the optics of this scenario are unacceptable. Society valorizes the white guys who rescued the princess while Chewie, “the other,” gets left out in the cold. Today, no filmmaker that wasn’t actively trolling moviegoers would let this scene make it into the final cut. But Hollywood was a different place when Star Wars arrived in 1977. I point this out because there is a strange tension at play within this new trilogy. Much like its perpetually tortured villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), this series can’t decide what it truly is. At times Star Wars pushes boundaries through inclusive casting and presenting fresh types of stories. These new movies almost try too hard to account for the original trilogy’s blind spots. But most often, director J.J. Abrams is unwilling to step away from what worked in the past, and the result is another Star Wars retread that serves its audience cinematic comfort food. One of the taglines for the movie is, “No one’s ever really gone.” So, let me tell you, ain’t that the truth. The film begins focused on its villain, Kylo Ren, who is now the Supreme Leader of The First Order. The late Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is somehow transmitting messages from beyond the grave. Threatened by the Sith Lord’s return, Kylo sets out to destroy Palpatine before he becomes too powerful to stop. At the same time, a dark force keeps calling out to Rey (Daisy Ridley), who, under Leia, has levelled up her Jedi skills. One thing is clear: whatever is reaching out to Rey and Kylo has sinister plans for them. It turns out that the Palpatine’s disciples have kept busy since Luke and Vader vanquished their dark lord. They’ve secretly assembled an immense fleet of starships that will shift the galaxy’s balance of power. And now, all they need is an all-powerful Sith Lord or Jedi Master to lead them to victory. Out of all the movies released since the original trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker comes the closest to capturing what made me fall in love with Star Wars. This picture is two-and-a-half-hours of swashbuckling adventure, and there isn’t a dull moment from the opening crawl until the final credits. These movies stand out for the ground-breaking special effects and fantastic creature designs (and samurai space wizards), but what keeps us coming back are the characters. And this is where The Rise of Skywalker shines brightest. Back in 2015, moviegoers fell in love with Rey, Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), and BB-8. But the last two films saw them spread out across the galaxy on separate missions. These characters have been such a huge part of pop culture that it’s easy to forget they haven’t spent much time onscreen together. The Rise of Skywalker is the first time the gang has been in one place working as a team, and it’s everything fans could hope for. Watching these beloved characters joke, squabble, and risk their lives together is as close as this film gets to reaching the original trilogy’s highs. For over 40-years now, Star Wars has lived on in cartoons, video games, comic books and streaming series. At this point it would take an exceptional filmmaker to fill the the movie with creatures and planets that don’t feel derivative. Time and time again, we’ve seen similar desert planets, arctic wastelands, and scummy bars. Abrams and his creative team do an excellent job populating the screen with aliens, settings, and technology that feel of the universe but still look fresh. Early on in the picture, there’s a dance sequence on a desert planet that I wanted the camera to stop and live in for a few extra minutes. We look on as colourfully clad alien creatures get there groove on as Rey and the gang make their way through the crowd. The sequence really highlights the strange and magical appeal Star Wars movies have when they’re firing on all cylinders. And then, only a few moments later, the camera lingers on some adorable alien children that could give “Baby Yoda” a run for cutey of the year. I can’t wait until I have the movie on Blu-ray so I can pour over all the fine details in each scene. As much as I enjoyed this movie it’s far from perfect. The scope of the film feels massive but not epic. Abrams sticks to his brand and jam-packs the movie with spectacle. There is no shortage of shootouts, chases, and lightsaber battles, but there isn’t one great moment that seared itself into my brain. No scene recaptures the visual highs of The Last Jedi’s throne room battle or rips your heart out like Paige Tico’s self-sacrifice. Abrams gives the audience more to enjoy than The Last Jedi, but nothing that is more enjoyable. I don’t want to sound like a killjoy, because The Rise of Skywalker is all kinds of fun. But its biggest drawback is Abrams’ obsequious desire to give fans what they want. The best films stick with you because they make you think about what you’ve seen and leave you asking questions. They aren’t afraid to make viewers uncomfortable. Would The Empire Strikes Back hit the same dramatic highs if it ended on a positive note? In 2017, The Last Jedi’s director Rian Johnson pissed off legions of Star Wars die-hards with his progressive take on the source material. “We are what they grow beyond,” Yoda says in the film at one point, which is like a middle-finger to Star Wars’ life-long fans. Abrams’ desire to please those fans limits the number of compelling places where the story may go. Unlike Johnson’s film, The Rise of Skywalker plays it too safe to make you feel like there is any real threat. Johnson operates like a Corellian smuggler, sneaking challenging themes into our blockbuster entertainment. Abrams is more like the Mos Eisley Cantina Band, content with belting out the hits. This last Star Wars trilogy passed back and forth between Abrams and Johnson like a hot potato, and the three parts don’t come together as a cohesive whole – Kelly Marie Tran fans will know what I’m talking about. But overall, there is one beautiful theme at play in each film. And that’s the notion that no matter where we come from and what we’ve done, we have the power to define who we are and what we stand for. It’s a message that keeps Abrams’ cinematic brand of comfort food tasting so delicious. If lowly smugglers, outcasts, and droids can be heroes, and orphans from dusty planets can become legends, then surely you and I have it in us, to follow our dreams.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) take on the enemy one last time in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. We sit there in the audience, watching those various dishes spin atop their dowels. While it's aesthetically pleasing, in the abstract, to see so many pieces of Wedgwood china twirling away contentedly, what matters — the compelling drama of the whole affair — comes not from watching them, but from watching the poor schmuck running back-and-forth behind them. If we happen to notice one plate starting to wobble, after all, the first thing we do is look away from it, to see if the plate-spinner sees it, too. We want them to succeed. The whole cheesy novelty act is predicated on this. The sheer skill it takes to keep the plates from falling — the eye, the timing, the light touch — that's what we're drawn to, really. The work of the thing. He nails that 42-year-old recipe dutifully — effortfully, it must be said — but the flavoring's off. The story doesn't require him to toss in as many ingredients from earlier films in the saga as he does here, but he dumps them all (callbacks, references, echoes, events, characters) into the mix anyway. The result leaves you feeling not so much bloated — the film moves too quickly and is too much fun for that — but certainly overstuffed. The Rise of Skywalker is ostensibly positioned as a culmination, but it seems less momentous, less inevitable than the term would suggest. Instead, it's an accretion — a buildup of plotlines and characters that rolls toward its conclusion by dint of momentum lent to it by all that's come before. That lack of clear focus is largely a result of this most recent trilogy's peculiar provenance. In The Force Awakens, Abrams created its main characters and teased some intriguing mysteries for future films to explore before handing the reins to Rian Johnson, whose The Last Jedi in 2017 proceeded to explore some and (justifiably, in my opinion) abandon others, in an effort to shake things up. Now that Abrams is back at the helm, several plot threads that Johnson had summarily sealed away in boxes — including the parentage of Rey (Daisy Ridley) — get hauled back down from narrative deep storage and unpacked for fresh inspection. It's the directorial equivalent of a particularly petty game of Exquisite Corpse, wherein one partygoer writes the first sentence of a story, then hands it to a second partygoer who writes a sentence undercutting the first sentence, then the first partygoer takes the paper back and doubles down on what they had written in the first place. But then, that first sentence — The Force Awakens, in this case — was powered by the easy chemistry among its leads: Rey's steely resolve, Finn's (John Boyega's) comic timing and Poe's (Oscar Isaac's) preternatural charm. Johnson's The Last Jedi, for understandable story reasons, split them up — and for all the good and worthy risks that film took, the sundering of our trio was the one that didn't pay off. In Skywalker, Abrams reunites our heroes and pointedly keeps them that way, allowing their interpersonal energy and humor to ground us through an extended series of planet-hopping fetch quests that can't help but blur together. The mysterious connection between Rey and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is allowed to become less so, as is only fitting in the final chapter of their story. Abrams shows an admirable willingness to maintain the shades of gray that Johnson introduced into Star Wars' black-and-white cookie of a moral universe. Here again, characters make choices that do not always strictly accord with their wardrobe's color scheme. Less successful are the return appearances of various characters from previous trilogies, most of whom have been forcefully (heh) inserted into events. (Abrams wields a shoehorn with the same determination that Rey wields her lightsaber.) Some viewers will cry ""fan service!"" Many more will consider themselves fans and be grateful for being so rigorously and exhaustively serviced. The blockbuster conclusion to an era-defining film franchise is a spectacular feat of plate-spinning — with one vital difference. With The Rise of Skywalker, the spinner — Abrams — wants us to focus on the plates alone. And there are certainly moments when we do: tender scenes featuring previously unused footage of the late Carrie Fisher (and her back-of-the-head stand-in), a chase through the desert, a lightsaber battle on some familiar wreckage amid a roiling ocean. But there are many more moments — especially toward the film's conclusion, when a sequence showing just how hopelessly dire things get for our heroes just goes on and on and on -- when the spinning plates disappear, and all we can see is poor J.J. Abrams darting back and forth and back again, frantically struggling to keep them going.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," Gazillions of people are obsessed with the small matter of heroine Rey’s surname. Is she a nobody or some kind of princess? And will she get together with charismatic ex-stormtrooper, Finn?  Will Poe hook up with his insanely cute droid, DD8 (I’m joking! Or am I?) And will footage of Carrie Fisher, shot before she died, make it feel as if Leia is still among us? Rumours concerning Mark Hamill have also had the internet in a tizzy. Still, here’s what the average person really wants to know: will The Rise Of Skywalker make them sob out loud and laugh til they cry? No one wants a franchise finale to be merely OK. A masterpiece or almighty mess is what makes headlines. But, hey, don’t shoot the messenger. Director JJ Abrams, wrapping up the nine-part saga, seems frantically bored for the first half of the movie, then partially redeems himself as anti-hero, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver; effortlessly the star of this show), becomes entwined with a host of vivid ghosts.  Resourceful Jedi knight, Rey (Daisy Ridley), knows that in order to defeat the First Order baddies, she has to discover Who She Is. The trailers hinted that villainous Sith leader, Sheev Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), might offer answers and so it proves. The Machiavellian manipulator, despite that nasty fall in Return Of The Jedi, is back and more rancid than ever. We’re supposed to find him extra spooky now that he’s blind (he looks uncannily like the Hilary Mason character in Don’t Look Now).  Anyhoo, Rey and her friends start planet/moon hopping and wherever Rey goes, Ren is close behind. Turns out Ren’s exquisitely asymmetrical face is the landscape Abrams most enjoys exploring. Like Joker’s tragic Arthur Fleck, Ren boasts a Richard III-meets-Frankenstein’s-monster vibe. This character (thanks to the script, as well as Driver’s performance) creates the loveliest of shockwaves. Ridley’s Rey is caught up in the emotional tumult, without exactly adding to it. It’s awesome that Disney’s trilogy is dominated by a young female. It’s just a shame it had to be THIS female. Ridley’s still no actress and Rey is dull on an intergalactic scale. Hardcore fans, enraged by Rian Johnson’s ground-breaking The Last Jedi, may take issue with a lesbian kiss here. They’ll surely be mollified, though, by Abrams’s general tone, best described as inoffensive (his first contribution to the series, The Force Awakens, was altogether bolder).  What we’re left with is something that, just in the nick of time, makes us FEEL. Seeing the late Carrie Fisher and other iconic figures will be especially touching for adults. Star Wars IX may be imperfect, but it offers nostalgia hounds the space odyssey of their dreams.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Disney was preoccupied with two things in 2019. The first was growing even bigger as a company, a task it accomplished by acquiring 21st Century Fox’s TV and film assets. The second was embracing the notion that its future lies not in the innovation it was once known for, but in taking very safe bets that guarantee its coffers will continue to swell, both now and long into the future. So that makes Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker a pretty perfect cap to Disney’s big year: It’s both glutted with plot points and embarrassingly cautious, precisely calculated to not to poke the hornet’s nest of detractors who popped up to voice their displeasure with The Last Jedi, with some complaining about how hallowed characters developed while others voiced more overtly racist and sexist concerns. I can’t read minds, but I think this movie is likely to please those fans.  For everyone else, though, The Rise of Skywalker falls somewhere between an overstuffed fan-service finale and a yawnfest. If The Force Awakens kicked off a new cycle in the franchise and The Last Jedi set it up to push beyond its familiar patterns, The Rise of Skywalker for the most part runs screaming in the other direction.  Odd, it is. The Jedi masters are always saying — including in this film — that a Jedi must be free of fear, that fear is the only enemy, that we must vanquish our fear in order to fulfill our destiny. The Rise of Skywalker emphasizes, specifically, that a Jedi cannot be afraid of her identity — which is to say, of her past or her future. But the fear is palpable in this one. It’s best not to know too much going into a Star Wars movie, no matter what you think your opinion is going to be. So all I will say is that this one picks up not terribly long after the end of The Last Jedi. A broadcast from, well, a menacingly familiar voice has been picked up by whatever devices people in this universe use to pick up broadcasts. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, this year’s hardest working man in Hollywood), having offed Snoke in the last movie, is now the Supreme Leader of the First Order and is running about the galaxy, looking for the voice’s source. Meanwhile, Rey (Daisy Ridley), with whom Kylo Ren shares some strong psychic connection, is training as a Jedi with Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, resurrected via repurposed footage and digital wizardry). Resurrection is a weird little motif in The Rise of Skywalker, and maybe I should have expected that given the title. (And the fact that the first words on the iconic opening crawl are THE DEAD SPEAK!) All kinds of people are being resurrected through all kinds of means throughout the film, as memories and holograms and sort of reanimated zombie-like creatures. It turns out that nobody ever really dies anymore in this universe, a physical and metaphysical marvel driven by the need for fan service.  And while lots of things occur, very little actually happens. The movie is easier to talk about in terms of what doesn’t happen. The tease from the thrilling last scene of The Last Jedi, that the Force might be something more than just a handful of people in a couple of families can harness, is basically ignored. Nobody needs to learn anything anymore; scenes of learning through failure are kept to a minimum.  The least possible amount of character development happens (except in one oddly shallow case), mostly because the movie — which clocks in at about 2 hours and 20 minutes — is designed as a chain of successfully completed quests. The question of Rey’s parentage is resolved in an extremely boring way, making most of what happened around that question in the previous two movies totally pointless.  Perhaps most tellingly, Rose Tico, played by Kelly Marie Tran, who was trolled viciously by a toxic cohort of so-called Star Wars fans after The Last Jedi, is pushed to the margins of the main plot. Though she was a fairly central figure in The Last Jedi, she’s pointedly excluded in The Rise of Skywalker, especially relative to newly introduced characters. She was a welcome, spunky screen presence in the last film; in this one, the role could have been filled by anyone. It’s noticeable, and it’s hard not to think that choice is designed to avoid further angering those fans who harbor a racist vendetta against a movie that dares to cast an Asian woman in a co-starring role. These choices and others I won’t reveal make it feel as if the film was written by committee — and, let’s be real, it probably was. (There are four credited screenwriters, including director J.J. Abrams and Jurassic World’s Colin Trevorrow, who was slated to direct this installment and then fired.) It has a lot of lightsaber battles, but it lacks humor, the thrilling reveals of The Force Awakens, and the visual imagination of The Last Jedi. Moments are emphatically teased (particularly one between Finn and Rey) and then never resolved, presumably so that they can be mined for fan service in some future comic book or TV show.  If I sound exhausted, it’s honestly because I am. Is this what audiences demand from franchise movies? Films that cater to what’s comfortable and capitulates to the most unimaginative fans? That feel as if they’re just ticking boxes on a checklist? You could say I’m taking this too seriously, but I think a series as important to movies — and to millions of people — as Star Wars deserves to be taken seriously. I could say some other stuff about The Rise of Skywalker. About its insistence on a morally simple universe where you’re either dark or light, but you only get to be on one side. About its continued mixing of gnostic and biblical imagery, but without a lot to say about either. About how it could have said something intriguing about our contemporary culture, power, or empires, but just doggedly insists on broadcasting the same two messages that Disney movies fall back on time and time again: first, that you have to believe in yourself, and second, that the real Force was the friends we made along the way. But The Rise of Skywalker isn’t good enough to earn that kind of discourse. Some day Disney may return to its roots and start innovating again. But it seems clear, at the end of a long 2019, that it has no interest in doing so anytime soon — least of all in arguably the most innovative of the properties it owns, the Star Wars series, which blew a hole in Hollywood when it premiered four decades ago.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Is The Rise of Skywalker ok for children to watch? Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, an honest parent guide to the last Star Wars film sequel of the series. No spoilers. #TheRiseofSkywalker May contain commissioned links. Before my husband, there was Star Wars. Star Wars and I have a relationship that goes way back, (not surprisingly, to a galaxy far, far away). From growing up with two brothers who could recite Episodes 4, 5, and 6 by heart, to raising nerdy kids who love Star Wars jokes and memes, and more recently my obsession with everything The Mandalorian (Baby Yoda is my spirit animal), my love affair goes deep. But I was hurt. The Last Jedi did NOT meet my expectations as I had hoped (see explanation below). So this time, I stayed away from all trailer talk, spoilers and conspiracy theories related to Star Wars Episode IX. One part ignorant bliss, one part wounded animal, I was determined to go in with an open mind and a better spirit for this, the last Star Wars movie of the saga. In this Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Movie Review | Safe for Kids?, we are breaking down the visuals, the story (no spoilers!), and every aspect of that PG-13 rating for parents while keeping our children in mind. In this no spoiler parent review, should we be rushing our kids into the theaters? Or is the force too powerful for these younglings? If you have the opportunity to view this film in one of those fancy IMAX/Dolby surround sound/vibrating chair/3D theaters, do it. Between the CGI effects, the music, the crisp details, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the eye candy you’ve been wishing for. Lightsaber fights, full sci-fi space battle explosions, epic planet terrains and creatures of fantasy, the visual feast alone is enough to satisfy Star Wars fan appetites. Star Wars broke my heart when The Last Jedi was released. Everyone raised my expectations with the addition of Kelly Marie Tran to the cast. The first Asian lead character in Star Wars film history, I kept hearing over and over that “she’s NOT the Asian sidekick.” Y’all lied to me. There’s so much to say about the story, and yet no words can accurately portray how this story made me feel. Overwhelming. Emotional. Gut wrenching. Empowering. Mind blowing. Head scratching. And yes, even disappointing. In less than 3 hours, Star Wars has the ability to take your soul from stillness to lightspeed. And this story pushes everything we thought that we knew about our beloved characters, the force, and Star Wars franchise as a whole. 
Can I get a hallelujah that Director J.J. Abrams is back? Sorely missed after the “Luke” warm Episode VIII with Rian Johnson at the helm, I was anxious to see if this lens flare loving, time travel obsessed director was going to close his Star Wars legacy with a bang. New characters, new toys, new plot twist, new camera angles – there was so much “new” thrown at us, it felt chaotic at times to try and keep up. Sensory overload times a billion. But then you have to balance 8 other movies, EPIC cameos, quotes that will be repeated until the end of time, raw emotion, a huge fan base, political agendas, diversity and inclusion, tying up loose ends, answering burning questions, constantly keeping the “big picture” in focus, and oh yeah – the fact that this is the last Star Wars movie of the epic saga. Like ever. I can’t even wrap my head around what impossible task J. J. Abrams had. The story was not perfect, by any means. There were flawed moments that certainly didn’t add to the 2 hour and 21 minute run time. For instance, there were plenty of scenes thrown in purely for selling future product. There were muddled moments that probably needed an extra 5 films to cover correctly, without it feeling rushed and crammed in. There were awkward moments that made me cringe. A lot. And the posthumous Carrie Fisher scenes affected me more than I was prepared for. To sum up The Rise of Skywalker, this film is NOTHING like The Last Jedi. As comforting as the original trilogy mixed with the excitement of watching The Force Awakens for the first time, this movie’s closure felt painful, but satisfying. Like the prodigal son finally coming home. Though I could have used a few more one liners. Is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker kid friendly? I’ll admit, I’m a little rusty in the world of PG-13 rated films. My Avengers: Endgame review is my most recent movie for 2019. And honestly, being the first ever Star Wars film that I have been able to pre-screen before the release, despite doing press junkets for both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, I was really nervous for my fellow Star Wars fans. That being said, I take our firmly planted Star Wars roots and parent fears into consideration, especially since Episode 9 is also rated PG-13. Are we talking “Star Wars PG-13 rating” or much worse in this Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Movie Review | Safe for Kids to see? Why is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker rated PG-13? Rated PG-13 for “sci-fi violence and action,” this is probably one of the most shocking PG-13 ratings I’ve ever had to criticize. What age rating would I recommend for parents wanting to bring their kids for this epic saga finale? To quote Luke Skywalker: “This is NOT going to go the way you think.” Violence/Suspense. Think Star Wars level – then take it to the next level. Much darker than previous films with a hint of suspense, this sci-fi violence/action rating is actually pretty accurate. Too scary for my 6-year old but perfect for my 11-year old, it’s a little bit more intense than the usual Star Wars violence and very realistic. Much worse than Episode III. Adult Themes. I haven’t been this hot and bothered since Return of the Jedi. Adult themes are definitely present in this movie, stirring up some feelings you probably didn’t realize were missing with this new trio of films. The intro of opposite sex and same sex kisses occur. Nothing dramatic, but something to be aware of.  While G/PG rated in the romance department, I will say that some of the death and borderline “horror” scenes are much more traumatic than your normal “pew pew a Stormtrooper” kind. Potential nightmare scenarios for young kids, this movie has the potential of scarring some who are squeamish around blood, wounds, death and creepy characters. Language. This section surprised me the most. Because according to the MPAA rating, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is supposed to have ZERO swear words. NONE. And yet there I was, shocked each time a word was used on screen. 4 curse words, to be specific. All of them spoken by the “good guys,” I couldn’t believe what my ears were hearing: *ss, H-E-double-hockey-sticks, d*mn, and d*mmit. From a mom who grew up with the original series (with a total of 5 language instances of H-E-double-hockey sticks and d*mn in the whole trilogy. All disclosed as “mild brief language” in the original PG ratings, with Return of the Jedi having ZERO swear words), I was sorely disappointed with the script additions of four in one movie. And I’m even more upset that language wasn’t even mentioned in the MPAA rating. Have we watered down our bad language standards so much so that curse words are just part of everyday conversation? Not in this household. Is Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker safe for kids? As mom and a Star Wars lover, I was also disappointed. The “family films” I grew up with do not accurately reflect what my kids are exposed to today. Those who normally would take young kids to see Star Wars movies together in the theater, I highly encourage you to pre-screen for your young kids. What age rating is recommended to watch Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker? I honestly would not recommend Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker to kids younger than age 7-8 years old. That PG-13 rating is more accurate depiction than The Force Awakens rating or even The Last Jedi. This film may not be appropriate for toddlers, preschoolers and even kindergarten/first grade age between the violence/suspense and use of swearing. “Please don’t let this movie ruin Star Wars for me.” I think we can agree that all Star Wars fans are begging this statement to be true. And overall, I would agree. Episode 9 did NOT ruin the other 8 movies for me. In fact, the painful closure of the story is also strangely satisfying. (*wipes tears from eyes.*) J. J. Abrams was given the impossible task to wrap up 40+ years of fandom. Let’s be honest, no sequel could ever complete that circle for us. But hey, it makes up for The Last Jedi. Star Wars as a whole is far from perfect. But Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the exhale for the breath we’ve been holding in for so long. Closure is never easy. It’s A LOT to process. And with only hours into my post screening phase, I’m still processing, analyzing and replaying moments in my head. Also, with over 2+ hours, make sure everyone goes potty before the film starts. And no, there’s NO end credit scene to stay for (RUN to the bathroom!). It may be the end of a 40+ year era, but it’s far from the end of the hype. The discussions, controversies, opinions and theories will be enough to fuel a new generation of Star Wars lovers. But for this period mark on another era of Star Wars films, Episode IX brings balance to the force within all of us. And I think that’s all we can truly ask for.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an action-packed, emotionally charged finale led by J.J. Abrams’s impressive directing and a strong script by Chris Terrio.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the final film of the Skywalker saga and the capstone to 40 years of Star Wars storytelling. The film is directed by J.J. Abrams, written by both Abrams and Chris Terrio and stars Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, John Boyega, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, and Ian McDiarmid. The film also welcomes back Star Wars legend, Billy Dee Williams, and a host of others. The film rounds out the Sequel trilogy and provides a final lynchpin to the story that George Lucas started in 1977. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an excellent addition and finale to the Star Wars saga. Coming in with the pressure and expectations to please each fan of multiple generations is an impossible task. While not hitting on each and every note, Abrams managed to land the franchise as safely as possible. The Rise of Skywalker ﻿had multiple goals it needed to achieve. It foremostly needed to conclude the story of the Age of Resistance. Giving definitive answers to the background of Rey, providing Finn and Poe with meaningful things to do and make sure legacy characters got the respect they deserved. The film managed to do all of this quite well. Additionally, it needed to be an ending that would satisfy all three trilogies. This is one area where it could have done just slightly more. While fan service should not be have been expected to be delivered as hamfistedly as Avengers: Endgame, fans might be left wanting a bit more from their iconic characters.  At times, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker feels like a Star Wars experience more than a Star Wars film. The pacing moves lightning-fast, jumping from scene to scene, planet to planet as the main characters push towards their goal. The action comes quickly and effectively, with huge set-pieces and strong cinematography leading the way. The film truly plays like it knows the pressure that is heaped on it from audiences, using humor to cut the tension at certain points and allow fans to breathe before it hits them with another emotional moment. Chris Terrio’s scripting and dialogue truly elevate the sequel trilogy to its highest heights. J.J. Abrams works best with an A+ writer working alongside him and Terrio fit the bill in many ways. The oscar-winning writer’s work truly shined when the dialogue was Force related. Discussions about the Jedi, the Sith, the nature of Emporer Palpatine and the truth of Rey took on new heights due to Terrio’s keen sense of mythological storytelling. The score of the film was also top-notch, with John Willaims going back to virtually every Star Wars film in his resume to develop a score that felt rich and familiar.  In terms of performance, each actor brought their A-game to the final film of the franchise. Daisy Ridley, in particular, was a standout. Her on-screen presense, especially with J.J. Abrams leading her, is especially great. She feels very comfortable in the role of Rey and her character is as charismatic, charming and fearless as ever. With The Rise of Skywalker, Ridley truly had a chance to flex her acting muscles through some steller sequences and emotional cues. Her counterpart, Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, was equally as great. Driver’s acting ability speaks for itself as he has been the true gem of the Star Wars Sequel trilogy with great performance after great performance. Much like Ridley, Driver seems more comfortable in his role and under Abrams as he closes his character arc in true Skywalker fashion. Outside of the two protagonists, Oscar Isaac and John Boyega both pull off their best work as Poe and Finn respectively. A true highlight in the film was having the trinity stay together for the majority of the movie. With all three separated for most of The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, it is incredibly refreshing to see the entire cast together on screen, letting their chemistry shine.  Legacy characters also make their return in a big way in The Rise of Skywalker. Carrie Fisher’s General Leia is a true marvel on screen. One can’t help but get emotional knowing how much larger her role could have been in this film, but the way J.J. Abrams and Lucasfilm managed to use cut sequences of her from previous films truly helped to keep her in the spotlight. In many ways, the film felt like a tribute to Leia’s character and brings her importance to the story into full focus. Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker also makes appearances in the film. Much had been made about the characterization of Luke in The Last Jedi, a lot of it from Hammil himself. While it does seem there was course correction done to make amends to the fans, actor, and character, seeing Luke Skywalker again in any capacity was truly special. Outside of the Skywalkers, there were notable cameos, one that truly stole the show was Billy Dee Williams returning as Lando Calrissian.  Overall, it is impossible to truly create the single final Star Wars film that touches on every note and each moment fans wanted. Otherwise, it would have to another few hours long. In order to make a film that primarily focuses on completing the Sequel Trilogy and wrapping up nine films, some sacrifices were made. Depending on what your favorite Star Wars film is, you will either be fine with it or it will linger with you. While there were certain characters and moments that I personally felt deserved more of a final goodbye, I was left very satisfied with the final product that is The Rise of Skywalker.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker  provides a beautiful ending to the story that began a long time ago, in a galaxy far far away. Action-packed, emotional, thrilling, humorous and full of heart, the film is a love letter to Star Wars. ",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019","  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a jam-packed tribute to George Lucas’ legacy and the millions of dedicated fans who’ve kept the franchise alive and well for decades. And while it lacks the more cohesive, streamlined storylines of its predecessors The Force Awakens (2015) and The Last Jedi (2017), Skywalker is buoyed by always-dazzling visuals, satisfying emotional beats and solid performances.
  The Rise of Skywalker, aka Episode IX, takes place not long after the action in The Last Jedi. When audiences last saw General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Droid friends BB-8, R2-D2 and C-3PO, the rebel forces fighting for good (the Resistance) were decimated by the evil First Order. Rey was trying to master her power, while also managing a powerful Force bond with presumed rival Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).
  Episode IX opens with a look at the opposite forces that fuel the universe — the light and the dark. New First Order Supreme Leader Kylo Ren is furiously trying to find the mysterious Emperor and squash the remaining members of the Resistance, while Rey is continuing her Jedi training under close watch by General Organa. When both sides receive separate intel about how to potentially destroy the other, this sets off a complicated series of action, space travel, and treasure hunting, ahead of the eventual epic end-all battle of the light vs. the dark, good vs. evil.
  Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), BB-8 and C-3P0 set out to find and destroy the source of the First Order’s power. Meanwhile Kylo Ren, who happens upon damaging information about Rey’s past, is hot on their trail and seeking to convince Rey to embrace the dark side before he’s forced to destroy her altogether.
  Directed by J.J. Abrams (The Force Awakens), Skywalker is a love letter to Star Wars itself, though a crowded one. In addition to a lot of story told over the course of the film’s nearly two and a half-hour run time, there are Easter eggs upon Easter eggs, and major set pieces that have become touchstones of the franchise. While thrilling to see, there’s a blink-and-you-miss-it feel to all the action, because of all the ground the film covers.
  One major highlight is the touching sendoff to Carrie Fisher’s Princess Leia. Using extra footage from the beloved actress’ final performance before her death in 2016, Skywalker gives the star and her character several key shining moments — including one with her daughter, actress Billie Lourd. The return of Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian also makes for a fun addition, along with several other cameos to look out for.
  Newcomers to the Star Wars universe include Jannah, (Naomi Ackie), Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), a figure from Poe’s past and Allegiant General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), a First Order officer, each of whom have memorable character moments that make a difference in the story. However, it’s Ridley’s Rey and Driver’s Kylo Ren that anchor it all and deliver the most emotionally-charged performances.
  Episode IX provides definitive conclusions to several plot points laid out in both Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, but also raises several surprising questions as it does so. And although the franchise is built upon crowd-pleasing action sequences and space travel and the legacy of The Force, etc., this film is strongest in the smaller moments and emotional connections between beloved characters, which can always use further exploration and attention.

"Dec 18, 2019"," J.J. Abrams helmed the return of the ""Star Wars"" saga with ""The Force Awakens"" in 2015 and mixed a new chapter with the nostalgia to deliver a movie that was loved by the fan base. Abrams returns to close out things with ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" (in theaters Friday) and clearly tries to pull off the magic trick twice. But this time it feels forced, unnecessary, and in some instances boring. The first half of the movie, which brings Rey (Daisy Ridley), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) together to track down the planet that Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) has been hiding out in (since ""Return of the Jedi"") and finally end the Sith, just isn't interesting. It feels like filler to get to the second half of the movie. It seems there was a strong idea of how to end the Skywalker saga, but they needed to fill in an hour before getting there. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) discovers the existence of Palpatine before the Resistance does, and he is given an important piece of information: the identity of Rey's parents (it turns out he knew only one part of the answer in ""The Last Jedi""). So, while Rey and the gang are trying to figure out where Palpatine is, Ren gets his mask put back together and goes out to find Rey with Palpatine's army. 
                          
                        But Abrams does get things back on track for the ending. And if you haven't zoned out by then, you may enjoy it. All questions are answered, all the people who need to show up do. It's full-on fan service, but at this point, nine chapters in, we just need to embrace it and move on with our lives. It's clear with just the pacing of the movie that Lucasfilm/Disney did not want another ""The Last Jedi,"" where Rian Johnson slowed things down and let it all breathe. ""The Rise of Skywalker"" is as quick as the Millennium Falcon. There is no time for you to catch your breath or for the actors to give anything in the scenes. It's basically, how many things can we do in how many locations? And the movie goes overboard with nostalgic hat tips. Some feel necessary, but for the most part it's a shock to the senses. It will make even the most dedicated ""Star Wars"" fan say, ""Enough!"" Because so much is packed in, there is little for the new characters — and some of the existing ones — to do. Thankfully, Leia (Carrie Fisher) gets a nice send-off, but there is one highly CGI'd scene with her that will have some folks up in arms. If there's one thing that will stay with me, it's Driver's performance as Ren. He's always the standout, but in this film he shows why he's an incredible talent. Honestly, the movie would be a disaster if it weren't for him. Despite all of that, the movie is going to be a monster at the box office — at least for the opening. The question becomes what kind of legs it has. It most likely won't have the staying power of ""The Force Awakens,"" but will it earn as much as ""The Last Jedi""? We'll be watching.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Whether together or far apart, Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) are often fighting for the upper hand in “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” Answer: I’m not telling, other than to say some of those lines DO appear in the eagerly anticipated, already hotly debated, sure to be polarizing, guaranteed to gross hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars Episode IX of the space opera saga. Directed and co-written by J.J. Abrams and featuring a twist and turn and surprise around nearly every corner, “The Rise of Skywalker” is an action-filled, plot-packed, unabashedly sentimental, cameo-heavy, rousing adventure. The special effects are as fantastic as you’d expect them to be. The performances are earnest and, in some cases, emotionally impactful. (Alas, certain characters don’t get to do much other than roar with great joy and/or terrible disappointment when they witness something major happening just over … THERE.) “The Rise of Skywalker” has some callbacks to previous chapters in the “Star Wars” canon, sometimes to cool effect. Just as often it feels as if Abrams and Co. are trying to right the ship, so to speak, for some of the perceived injustices and inconsistencies in the still controversial “The Last Jedi” from two years ago. And in this corner, representing the Dark Side, weighing in with enough family-related inner conflict to give Shakespeare a headache, we have Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren (formerly Ben Solo) — slayer of his father, Han Solo, and sworn enemy to his mother Leia and his late Uncle Luke. If you’ve seen the trailer or read any of the online buzz, it’s no secret “The Rise of Skywalker” marks the return of heroic characters such as Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian (still smooth and uber-cool and reliable under pressure) and, most shockingly, the franchise villain of all villains, Ian McDiarmid’s Emperor Palpatine, long thought dead but maybe not so dead after all. Now, in the “Star Wars” galaxy, there are all sorts of ways in which a characters whose arc has seemingly ended can resurface. One can be a clone, or a vivid memory, or something else. I’ll leave it to you, fine viewer, to discover how and why Palpatine resurfaces. Much of “The Rise of Skywalker” consists of metaphysical dances of strength and will and character between Rey and Kylo Ren, who don’t have to be in the same room or even on the same planet to face off with one another. (This requires Ridley and Driver to do a lot of acting in which they hold their arms out and flex like gods of thunder and lightning, while grimacing to let us know they’re using all their might to ward off that attack or lift those rocks or shoot down that fighter plane.) Rey believes Ben Solo still lives inside the deeply conflicted Kylo Ren, who talks a mean game and enjoys choking out mere human generals who dare question his motives, but still has a rather endearing pigeon-toed gait, fashionable hair and the sensitive, wet eyes of a Beat poet. (Not that Beat poets exist in this long-ago galaxy far, far away. Or maybe they do; we can’t understand all the languages all the creatures in these movies are employing.) Kylo Ren tells Rey her lineage is more complicated than she thinks it is, and her rightful place is alongside him. Together, they can rid the galaxy of the Jedi warriors once and for all and take their rightful place as rulers of the New and Even Bigger and Badder First Order. Driver is one of the best young actors in the world, but he’s more convincing playing conflicted than pure, bone-chilling evil. Ridley has an uncanny ability to hold the screen, even when the screen-filling, explosion-filled, CGI battles give way to close-ups of Rey, the weight of the galaxy reflected in her expressions. It’s always great to see old friends R2-D2 (Jimmy Vee) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). Even BB-8 (Dave Chapman) has grown on me. These ARE the droids we’re looking for. At times we see Leia Organa only from behind and hear the great Carrie Fisher’s voice as Leia talks to Rey, hugs Rey, advises Rey. The use of archival footage (and whatever CGI trickery that was required) is sparing and effective, and results in a lovely bit of closure for a beloved character. There are a few moments when it feels as if this movie is trying to satisfy every “Star Wars” fanatic in the world — but that would be beyond the scope of even the most impressive Jedi mind trick. “The Rise of Skywalker” rarely comes close to touching greatness, but it’s a solid, visually dazzling and warmhearted victory for the Force of quality filmmaking.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019",It's time to freeze this franchise in carbonite for a while.,NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," THIS is it - this is the end. After 42 years and 9 films, it’s the final chapter of the most life changing film franchise in history. The Rise of Skywalker has a hell of a job to do - tying up a million threads while satisfying a legion of extremely picky fans and it’s pretty much mission accomplished. So keen is director JJ Abrams to make us feel safe under his watch, it feels a little like Star Wars by numbers - a greatest hits to temper the rebellion of its predecessor - which is kind of ironic. The first half of the film is dizzying; Leia and the rebellion are planning their coup, Finn, Poe and Chewie are bombing around in the Falcon helping her by tracking a spy from within the First Order and Rey is under the watch of Leia - exercising her Jedi muscles and desperately trying to figure out what her complex relationship with Kylo Ren is all about. There are a lot of beacons and trackers and hidden artefacts going on and with each set piece lasting no longer than a couple of minutes before the trademark Lucas wipe, it feels like a montage of moments rather than a flowing story. Before we get to the end level battles (Palapatine is back obviously) we cram in a lightning speed tour of the galaxy, taking in some incredible planets - my favourite being the Interstellar-style tidal waves battering the fallen Death Star II just off Endor. Stunning. The Last Jedi made a LOT of people very cross, but I stand by Rian Johnson’s decisions and wonder what this film could have been, had TLJ not pretty much been written out of canon (where are those kids, dreaming of being a Jedi and flexing their skills we got a glimpse of? What of the issues within the rebellion that took up so much time?) Ideas Johnson had decided were cliched are reinvigorated. The Knights of Ren are back from their sabbatical and Rey’s parentage, dismissed as nothing in TLJ now plays a central role once more. Yes - we find out what all the fuss has been about. Having said all that - it’s impossible not to get sucked in to the spectacle. For all its complications and sixpence-turning, it has some simply incredible moments. Rey and Kylo Ren’s relationship is the best in the whole saga (don’t @ me), Lando is the don once more, Carrie Fisher’s death is tackled with dignity and tenderness, C3P0 as a Spanish Buzz Lightyear is hilarious and there are at least three moments in the film that are genuine gasp-out-loud surprises. We finally get an LGBT moment in space too...",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," By  Adi Robertson, a senior tech and policy editor focused on VR, online platforms, and free expression. Adi has covered video games, biohacking, and more for The Verge since 2011.  I thought a lot about Rey’s bread while I was watching Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The weird green food is a completely extraneous detail from Rey’s life as a desperate scavenger on the desert planet Jakku, where she began her journey in The Force Awakens, director J.J. Abrams’ first entry in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. But it’s the kind of memorable quirk that makes Star Wars feel like a fantastical world still inhabited by real human beings. The characters in Rise of Skywalker don’t have time to bake bread, which is understandable for a third-act finale involving a galaxy-spanning war. Unfortunately, they don’t really have time to be human either. Abrams has assembled a sweeping conclusion to Star Wars, pulling together stories that span both real and fictional decades. He’s guiding a deeply nostalgic series past an entry that decried nostalgia: Rian Johnson’s ambitious and polarizing The Last Jedi. It’s a vision that’s far too big for one movie, though — and the resulting film is permanently on fast-forward, too busy ticking off boxes to let audiences revel in its world-shifting twists. The Last Jedi often felt more like a conclusion to the Star Wars sequel trilogy than a midpoint, either resolving or short-circuiting The Force Awakens’ biggest mysteries. It took a harsh look at the Jedi, the Resistance freedom fighters, and the monstrous Sith, suggesting that these institutions might be fundamentally broken and potentially clearing the way for something new. But Abrams has criticized Last Jedi’s deconstruction-focused approach, and he spends a lot of Rise of Skywalker’s 141 minutes walking those choices back. This doesn’t mean that Rise of Skywalker simply rehashes earlier Star Wars installments. The film complicates the series’s long-standing alliances between noble Jedi and scrappy rebels on one side and evil empires and monstrous Sith lords on the other. It reveals plot twists that recast major figures’ origins in unexpected ways. It uses a new (to the films, at least) Force power from The Last Jedi to great aesthetic and narrative effect. It’s just determined to deliver as many answers and as much plot momentum as possible, even when slowing down or holding back would give its revelations far more weight. The Rise of Skywalker retcons a few particularly controversial points from The Last Jedi, and it starts with just enough distance to let that film’s brutal conflict fade into the background. Instead of being split across several interlocking plots, the three protagonists — Resistance leader Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), former stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), and scavenger-turned-Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley) — are facing down a familiar threat that’s linked to villain Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and his quasi-fascist First Order. This fight leads them on a long, planet-hopping adventure that doubles as a cat-and-mouse game between Kylo Ren and Rey, who share a mysterious connection with each other. A lot of the film amounts to an interplanetary scavenger hunt, and a lot of its stopovers evoke familiar Star Wars settings. But the best vignettes also capture the feeling that this world is bigger than any single story, no matter how high its stakes. That single story, unfortunately, sweeps the characters along in ways that range from clumsy to downright unsettling. The moment-to-moment banter between Rey, Finn, and Poe (as well as supporting players like C-3PO) can easily carry a scene. But beyond that, most of the conversations are bluntly expository, designed to arrange everyone in the right place at the right time with the right justification. The film introduces new supporting figures like the criminal Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) who has a snazzy crimson jumpsuit and a long-buried connection to Poe, and the freedom fighter Jannah (Naomi Ackie) who shares some important background with Finn. But Zorii, in particular, is more of a narrative device than a person because, in general, characters’ convictions and motivations matter far less than their utility to the plot. At multiple points, they exclaim that they have no idea why they’re making some horribly risky decision, which feels almost like a metatextual cry for help. And Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who could be the heart of the film, is ill-served by the snippets of footage that could be shot before Fisher’s death — consisting almost entirely of vague, contextless platitudes. The Rise of Skywalker plays with the expectations set by series like The Avengers where a final installment is a sign that all bets are off and anyone can die. The film feints at darkness more than it actually plumbs it, but it builds on The Last Jedi’s exploration of guilt and sacrifice. Its protagonists are determined to defeat the First Order, but after their earlier bitter defeats, they’re aware that heroes don’t always triumph. Or at least… they should be. The story delivers a few moments that should be heart-wrenching for its protagonists, putting beloved characters at risk. They’re passed over so quickly, though, that there’s no time for anyone to react. Star Wars has long struggled to categorize exactly which lives matter; the sequel trilogy asks us to care for individual stormtroopers like Finn but still cheer their deaths as brainwashed mooks, for example, and it depicts droids as fully sentient entities while still casually accepting them as property. But The Rise of Skywalker pushes this to the breaking point, depicting what could be one of the most painful personal sacrifices in the entire nonology — and then bizarrely playing it for laughs before taking the whole thing back. The exception to all of these problems is Rey’s ambivalent antagonism with Kylo Ren, which provides some of the film’s most fleshed-out and engaging scenes — as well as a series of complex lightsaber battles that rival anything in the earlier sequel films. The Star Wars sequels have always centered on the idea that both characters are struggling with their own personal light and dark sides, even as they’re attempting to turn the other toward good or evil. In earlier films, this conflict has been filtered through larger battles between the First Order and the Resistance, as well as secondary villains like Supreme Leader Snoke and Kylo Ren’s partner General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). In The Rise of Skywalker, the pair finally get a chance to confront each other as individuals. But The Rise of Skywalker too rarely connects its big plot reveals to their human consequences. Abrams delivers answers to some of The Force Awakens’ biggest questions. Critics of The Last Jedi were upset with Rian Johnson for evading these same questions, but the answers are almost more confounding than silence. They raise possibilities that could keep Star Wars fans busy for years because they cut so close to so many of the entire series’s big relationship dynamics. It’s frustrating that the film doesn’t acknowledge this better. Instead, once the puzzle box has been opened, its contents are no longer treated as interesting. There’s plenty of spectacle and space-fighting to keep The Rise of Skywalker entertaining. Minute to minute, it’s an enjoyable movie. And at its brightest points, it captures Star Wars at its best. But Abrams just hasn’t pared down the bombast enough to keep his story grounded — and with the trilogy at its end, it’s strange to be left with as many new questions as resolutions.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," After the divided reaction to The Last Jedi, the box office troubles of Solo and the surprise departure of director Colin Trevorrow, JJ Abrams had a nearly impossible task when taking over the reins of Star Wars Episode IX. Somehow he had to cap off the entire “Skywalker saga” of Star Wars movies, resolve the new trilogy, address the big revelations of The Last Jedi and – probably crucially to LucasFilm – somehow come up with a response to the vociferous hatred a minority of fans had towards Rian Johnson’s Episode VIII. Yes, The Rise of Skywalker has its moments. As a coda to Star Wars it includes some sweet nods to the franchise's past, some genuinely great cameos and plenty of eye-catching elements. It pays off the storyline of Daisy Ridley’s young Jedi Rey, Adam Driver’s troubled Kylo Ren and even manages to include the late Carrie Fisher in a significant (if slightly awkward) role. But it’s also a messy smorgasbord of a film that barely pauses to flesh out its plot, characters or mythos, carelessly introducing new elements seemingly at a whim. And following on from the challenging themes of Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, Rise of Skywalker sometimes seems to backtrack on, rewrite or quietly sideline crucial elements from that film in what could be seen as a misguided attempt to regain the trust of hypothetical “fans” who may not exist anyway. Certainly, there’s a lot to digest here. From the off, Episode IX bombards the audience with information, new missions, locations and characters, then almost as quickly discards them to move onto the next thing like a child tearing through their toy box. Our heroes have to locate a spy, then find a dagger, then solve a code, then find the dagger again, then find a certain character, then follow that character… the list goes on, and with little time to breathe the whole story ends up feeling cramped and rushed, doggedly dragging itself across the finish line. It’s so keen to speed ahead that some key plot points – the return of The Emperor! – are actually introduced in the film’s opening crawl as having already happened, making what should be a terrifying and momentous comeback feel everyday, unimportant and a bit underwhelming. Oh, the Emperor’s back? Cool, makes sense, let’s get on with it. New characters like Keri Russell’s Zorri Bliss, Naomi Ackie’s Jannah and Richard E Grant’s Allegiant General Pryde are fun but barely have a chance to be introduced in the ongoing blitz of fetch quests and exposition, while old favourites like Billy Dee Williams’s Lando feel tacked on, never quite making an impact. The late Carrie Fisher also has a much-publicised return, of course, constructed from old scenes shot from The Force Awakens following her tragic death in late 2016 to give Leia a storyline in this final film. It’s fair to say that the effect of her return (while technically impressive) doesn’t always work perfectly, with her lines and performance not quite gelling with those around her, but it feels appropriate to have Fisher playing such a crucial (if small) role in the film. Less appropriate? The sidelining and exclusion of Kelly Marie Tran’s Resistance fighter Rose Tico, who is summarily demoted from her crucial role in The Last Jedi to become little more than a glorified cameo, getting about as much screen time and plot relevance as Heroes star Greg Grunberg (who plays X-Wing pilot “Snap” Wexley) and Lost’s Dominic Monaghan, who doesn’t even get named onscreen. One would hope this writing choice wasn’t triggered by a largely sexist and racist troll backlash to Rose that forced Tran off social media in 2018, but for whatever reason it seems bizarre, like introducing Lando in Empire Strikes Back only to have him just wave from the sidelines and shout ‘Good luck guys!’ to Luke and Leia during Return of the Jedi. Is this what the fans actually wanted? Who knows? And once you start looking for it, a tendency towards attempted fan service runs deep within this movie. As with Abrams’ The Force Awakens (but unlike The Last Jedi with it’s “let the past die” refrain) Episode IX is a paean to nostalgia, stuffed with the kind of musical Easter Eggs, surprise cameos and visual callbacks that we’ve come to expect and enjoy from these movies. Just as Episode VII aped A New Hope, IX riffs on Return of the Jedi, down to a final crucial clash with the Emperor and a brief sightseeing visit to the second Death Star. But it’s far bulkier and more unwieldy than Jedi, and compared to the 1983 film’s upbeat ending the conclusion here feels a little bland, more of a shrug than an air-punch and not nearly as inspiring as you might have anticipated. And then there’s those Last Jedi revisions. While I won’t give anything away here for fear of spoilers, it’s fair to warn you that some of the ideas introduced by Johnson’s movie are fairly firmly walked back to where Abrams left them at the end of The Force Awakens, which may satisfy that film’s critics. For my money, though, whether you agree or don’t agree with what happened in Episode IX, Lucasfilm should have stuck to its convictions. Imagine if in Episode VI, Vader had revealed he was just lying about being Luke’s father, and it was someone else entirely – The Rise of Skywalker feels a little like that, with new revelations about certain characters feeling more like lame, retconned fan theories than earned, convincing storytelling. There are other issues to pick up on as well. The dogfights and space battles in this film? Forgettable, especially compared to what we saw in The Last Jedi or Rogue One. The lightsaber duels? Beyond one force-linked mental battle, not particularly impressive. Instead, the action highlights come from one extended blaster battle between Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and The First Order, a Force-based clash between Rey and Kylo and some of Rey’s training montages. But overall there’s a lot to like here too, and despite some of what I've said above, in the end I wasn't completely turned off by this film. Really, the saving grace of this whole movie is that it contains some great performances (Driver especially) and, possibly thanks to the sheer nostalgic power of the Star Wars franchise, just about manages to stick the landing in its sweet, emotional final scenes. Some of the new characters and creatures were genuinely beguiling (Babu Frik the droid chop-shopper was a personal highlight), the visuals were sometimes astonishing and the level of invention on display was truly impressive – visual and practical effects Oscar nominations should be incoming. The trouble is that there’s just so much going on in this film, so many attempts to make everything work perfectly for absolutely everybody, that it might end up not fully satisfying anyone. For me, it felt a little like the recut Justice League movie released by Warner Bros after the poor response to director Zack Snyder’s earlier Batman vs Superman – a desperate attempt to backtrack on challenging creative choices that just ends up feeling more anodyne even if it’s less divisive. If this truly was the last chapter in Star Wars, it’d be a slightly disappointing winding up of the saga. As it is, it seems likely that interesting and challenging Star Wars movies could one day return to the multiplexes, perhaps more easily now that the main movies have been tackled and the pressure has lessened. For now, though, it’s time to say goodbye to the Skywalkers and the story we’ve all been following for the past four decades, and it's not quite the going away party we might have looked for.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," So Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) says, near the end of 2017’s “The Last Jedi” and again in the trailer for the new sequel, “The Rise of Skywalker.” In the trailer, those words are followed by an evil laugh so instantly familiar to fans of the long-running sci-fi franchise as belonging to a character who was killed five movies ago that it held out the promise of resuscitation. That promise is confirmed in the on-screen text “crawl” that, as with previous films, opens “Skywalker,” catching us up with what we need to know. What that text crawl — which opens with the words “The dead speak!” — doesn’t tell us is that the new movie, while fast-paced, eventful, occasionally even surprising, also panders wildly, closing out this last chapter of the nine films that have come to be known as the Skywalker Saga with a story that delivers to the faithful exactly the movie they wanted. On the one hand, that’s a good thing. On the other, it may not be the closure this epic, now 42 years in the making, deserves. As “Skywalker” opens, we learn that Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren, new supreme leader of the First Order (the bad guys), is about to take a meeting with that character we all thought was dead, a meeting that he hopes will confer even more power upon him and dominion over the galaxy. Rey (Daisy Ridley), our scavenger-turned-hero introduced in 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” is meanwhile continuing her training as a Jedi knight among the rebel forces struggling against the oppressors. She and Kylo are powerful nemeses, each of them sensitive to the mystical energy known as the Force, with Kylo having embraced its dark side and Rey its light. It is no accident that her name sounds like “ray,” but she wrestles with the pull of the shadows, for reasons we don’t yet know (but will by this film’s final act). For his part, Kylo, the son of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, digitally resurrected since her 2016 death), is also torn between good and evil. That tension — Rey and Kylo kind of dig each other, but they’re also, you know, mortal enemies, so let’s call it a love-hate relationship — is the spine of the new film. There’s other stuff going on as well. Almost too much stuff, as Rey and her resistance-fighter comrades Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and the droids C-3PO and BB-8 set out on a life-or-death mission that leads them to video-game-like obstacles and dangers.  These include, in rapid succession, flying Stormtroopers — yes, they fly now, as Poe notes sardonically — quicksand and a giant, carnivorous worm, as well as many scenery and climate changes. The special effects and cinematography are well done, particularly a scene set in wreckage that can only be reached by traversing monstrous ocean waves. None of that is especially new. Nor is the climactic battle scene that will hinge on a one-chance-in-a-million stratagem. And the film’s aversion to death, or at least the sort of sacrifice that matters — one that demonstrates victory comes at a real cost — is also familiar. When Luke said no one’s ever really gone, he didn’t mean that no one actually dies in Star Wars. Plenty of characters, named and unnamed, have given their lives in the pursuit of destruction — or preservation — of life as we know it in the rebel stronghold. But we’re not given even the deaths of prominent characters in ways that might make us actually feel something other than adrenaline. In myth, including not just the gods and heroes of ancient Greece and Rome but Westerns and even the superhero comic books and TV serials that inspired the Star Wars films, the good guys are often flawed. So it makes sense that Rey must be seen to grapple with her less virtuous nature (which she does in a scene that shows her, quite literally, facing off against herself). But there ought to be costs to overcoming those weaknesses — costs that the makers of Star Wars seem unwilling to demand of their hero or their story. Everybody wants a happy ending. But that doesn’t mean that we should always get the one we want. It’s fine, if also cliche, to be reminded that good will triumph over evil. But it would make for a deeper and more powerful lesson — one that, after nine movies, might leave a lasting dent in the heart — if the hero actually had to give up something, or someone, that didn’t feel like a tiniest bit of a cop-out.",NEUTRAL

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away (Los Angeles, 1973), George Lucas saw his 13-page treatment for a space opera titled The Star Wars turned down by United Artists, Universal Pictures and Walt Disney Productions before Alan Ladd Jr., the head of 20th Century Fox, was persuaded to invest. Lightspeed past the 42 years since Star Wars was released in May, 1977, and you arrive at a time when the nine-movie Skywalker saga has shaped cinema, pop culture, generations. And now lands the film that concludes not just the story arcs unfurled in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, but those running through a trilogy of trilogies. How can director/co-writer J.J. Abrams orchestrate such a feat, satisfactorily? Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker opens with the familiar yellow crawl, this time informing us of a mystery broadcast that could have galaxy-spanning repercussions… To say much more of the serpentine plot would be to enter spoiler territory and risk a Death Star, or at least death stares, trained in this direction. “Nothing is impossible,” Leia tells Rey, with the late, great Carrie Fisher brought back to our screens courtesy of seamlessly repurposed unused footage from Episode VII. Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio might disagree, however, for the first half-hour of their screenplay is so laden with plot and exposition that it struggles to get rolling.  Some of the bantz between Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Rey also stutters, and there is a surfeit of characters: all of the aforementioned plus old favourites Finn (John Boyega), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, with more to do this time), R2-D2, Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o) and Rose (Kelly Marie Tran); returning Star Wars royalty Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who was last seen in Return Of The Jedi; and several newbies, including Richard E. Grant (channelling Peter Cushing as baddie Allegiant General Pryde), Naomi Ackie (Resistance ally Jannah), Keri Russell (Zorii Bliss, who has past history with Poe) and, distractingly, Dominic Monaghan (Resistance soldier Beaumont Kin). There are also, naturally, plenty of new ’bots and beasts, with a tiny droidsmith named Babu Frik damn near stealing the show. It’s a right old jostle, and the knockabout tone of some of the humour might just reignite the ire of those who rolled their eyes when Poe put General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson) on hold in The Last Jedi. Bumpy as the ride sometimes is, though, no one can accuse Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker of stinting on action, emotion, planet-hopping, callbacks, fan-servicing, or, well, anything Star Wars, as Abrams goes for maximalism laced with classicism. There are landspeeders that look like the heavy-duty Batpod in The Dark Knight, jet-packing Stormtroopers (“They fly now?”), lightsaber duels a go-go, gigantic, tumultuous dogfights, gun battles that light up the steely blue corridors of spaceships with zapping red lasers, Rey riding a skimmer over waves bigger than the one that claimed Bodhi at the end of Point Break… And yet the very best moments are the quiet ones, which bob gently on the swells of John Williams’ iconic music to elicit shivers like only Star Wars can. And best of the best is the end of the end, a tear-summoning scene that offers the perfect curtain drop. After nine Episodes in which good and evil have strengthened and waned as surely as the quality has soared and plummeted, we end at just the right place, with balance in the Force.

"Dec 18, 2019"," For the third time in many adults' lifetimes, a conclusion of the Skywalker saga. Once again, a trilogy has built to this finale; once again, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance. This one features no Sarlaac pit, nor is it as much of a step up from its predecessor as Revenge Of The Sith. But it does feel like a conclusion to the story that director JJ Abrams began in The Force Awakens, for better and sometimes for worse. Although The Last Jedi split fan opinion, it unquestionably caused the biggest shake up in Star Wars lore since that revelation in The Empire Strikes Back. That opened up the story’s universe to exciting new possibilities: to characters beyond the small Skywalker group and to injustices and shortcomings in the Resistance as well as the Empire. Yet Abrams almost entirely ignores the doors it opened and goes back to his first instinct, sticking close to elements established in The Force Awakens. So abandoned ideas like the Knights of Ren are back, and the conversation about Rey's parentage that Johnson seemed to lay to rest is reborn like the Emperor. Perhaps it should feel like a relief after Last Jedi’s shocks, but instead the effect is to make this story feel like a step backwards at times rather than a great leap forward, and to make the whole trilogy feel disjointed instead of just one film in it. Still, some elements are wonderful. Daisy Ridley's Rey is training now under Leia (Carrie Fisher) and has become more confident in her power, if not in her capacity to resist the Dark Side. She is still linked, bound even, to Adam Driver's Kylo Ren, and their clashes gives the film most of its best emotional scenes. Their strange connection has outlasted Snoke and grown stronger; they can duel no matter where they are in the galaxy, and taunt each other with visions of the future that support their own beliefs. And Ridley’s terrific, tormented by the idea that it is her destiny to go to the Dark Side and afraid of her own power. She and Kylo are therefore strangely well matched. Rey is passionately invested in her friendships and her cause; he is passionately cynical and suspicious of everyone. Rey is convinced by Finn that she doesn’t have to do everything alone here; Kylo still has terrible impulse control and flits off after her instead of Supreme Lead-ing the First Order whenever possible. But don’t worry, he leaves Domnhall Gleeson's Hux and Richard E. Grant's Allegiant General Pryde in charge, both sneering competitively and delightfully at, well, the entire universe but neither seeming entirely reliable. Meanwhile Finn (John Boyega) now travels with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewie (Jonas Suotamo) harvesting information from spies for Leia. Poe – in full Indiana Jones mode – is loads of fun here, though these capers bear little relation to his learning curve last time. Boyega is strangely underserved: he gets more screentime than before but less forward motion. While Finn’s bond with Rey is repeatedly said to be important to both, they get no room to actually develop it. He's too busy being introduced to new rebel Jannah (Naomi Ackie), a charismatic actress without much to do. It might have been more economical storytelling to just let Finn shack up with Poe – or to give Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) more than a few lines. Keri Russell's Zorii Bliss is another interesting figure who’s ultimately mostly there to flirt with Poe. Does he really need another love interest when he can generate heat with literally anyone? Alongside other newcomers like Babu Frik (Shirley Henderson) and droid D-0, and the glorious return of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and others, there’s a whole lot of distraction on our heroes’ journey. Sometimes it’s fan service, but too often it feels more like pandering. That journey, too, is more complicated than normal. To defeat the Emperor, our heroes face a quest straight from high fantasy or average gaming: find the thing that points to the other thing to do the next thing, with a couple of bonus rescues along the way. The trail leads to the storm-battered remnants of the second Death Star, the ""Forbidden Desert of Pasaana"" and the snow-flecked world of Kijimi. The level of craft and design in these films remains extraordinary; visually they’re all gorgeous, particularly the towering waves of that world in the Endor system. As they search, destiny keeps calling. Rey and Kylo must face one another again; the Emperor must be defeated without the victor simply taking his place on the Sith Throne. And Emperor Palpatine is back, terribly changed but still potent, more machine now than man. Whether that is a good thing for Star Wars storytelling is less clear. That’s because, for all the visual panache, pleasing cameos and interesting newcomers here, for all that Ridley and Driver pour into their stand-offs, the Emperor's presence shows a disturbing lack of faith at the heart of Rise Of Skywalker. The fan backlash last time has been taken on-board too well; the storytelling here sputters whenever it approaches any similar chance to turn away from narrative convention and do something truly unexpected. You wish that this galaxy didn't feel so small and scared of stepping away from George Lucas' shadow. Maybe it won’t matter to fans. There are effective emotional punches before the end, as we say a final goodbye to Carrie Fisher and her generation of stars and as Kylo and Rey face their demons. Arguably the story more or less ends up in the right place, despite the threads left hanging. When it focuses on Rey and Kylo, this film usually works. Whatever the Dark Side says, we can make our own destiny, and we change the universe when we do.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” does the job. It wraps up the trio of trilogies begun in 1977 in a confident, soothingly predictable way, doing all that is cinematically possible to avoid poking the bear otherwise known as tradition-minded quadrants of the “Star Wars” fan base. Thanks to Daisy Ridley, primarily, director and co-writer J.J. Abrams’ safety-first approach to rounding out this portion of Disney’s crucial income stream retains something like a human pulse. There’s nothing as cute as Baby Yoda or anything in “The Rise of Skywalker,” for the record. But I do like the droid BB-8’s new droid pal. So that’s one thing you can’t get at home on “The Mandalorian.” In the musical “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,” the mail-room clerk who sings “The Company Way” pays tribute to his lifelong credo: “bold caution.” That’s “The Rise of Skywalker” in two words. It’s well-crafted and heavy on nostalgic cameos from familiar spirits gone by. It embraces and supercharges the serial cliffhanger tradition creator George Lucas loved enough to embark on a remake of “Flash Gordon” two generations ago. When he couldn’t secure the rights, Lucas went ahead and made his own “Flash Gordon.” And now our household has a half-dozen semi-operative lightsabers in the basement and a set of “Star Wars” sheets and pillowcases in the laundry basket. The first three words of the title crawl are: “The dead speak!” Somehow, somewhere, a phantom version of Emperor Palpatine, ruler of the First Galactic Empire, is sending a signal that he’s back in business. The Resistance now must face an adversary known as the Final Order. Ridley anchors a busy yet simple narrative as Rey, the “last hope of the Jedi,” who remains in psychic deadlock with Supreme Leader and bad boy Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The gang introduced in large part by Abrams’ entertaining 2015 trilogy-starter, “The Force Awakens,” remains in prominent position here, and comports itself as more of a straightforward rooting interest than it was in the most recent and controversial “Star Wars” movie, “The Last Jedi” (2017). Finn (John Boyega),dear old shambling shag-rug Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo, underneath it all) and take-charge Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac, a dashing asset as always) are joined by various newcomers. The most notable is the bow-and-arrow huntress Jannah, played by the splendid Naomi Ackie.  Where’s her movie? I want her movie! As for poor, sidelined Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) … her radically reduced presence from “The Last Jedi” feels suspiciously like a bone thrown to the previous film’s myriad haters. Here she’s essentially “third anonymous female with a blaster on the left.” She has barely a dozen lines, most of them on the order of: “Where’s Finn?” The script by Chris Terrio and director Abrams litters the narrative with clues and gadgets and chapter-enders: a Sith inscription on a knife here, a lengthy lightsaber battle on a storm-tossed spaceshipwreck there. The movie takes its sweet time revealing a standard-issue revelation regarding Rey’s ancestry. The cameos and victory-lap encores are the selling point in “The Rise of Skywalker.” Billy Dee Williams returns as Lando; certain aggravating forest creatures from “Return of the Jedi” (1983) get a quick close-up (for me, not quick enough). And strictly for fans of fine actors stuck in  minuscule roles, good old Denis Lawson  — forever cherishable for, among other earthbound pictures, Bill Forsyth’s “Local Hero” — pops up for a second or two, too. As stated in this review’s opening crawl: The movie does the job. Abrams keeps it on the straight and narrow, though there is a brief, middle-distance same-sex kiss off in a corner in the finale. In the main, “The Rise of Skywalker” allows itself no risk, or any of that divisive “Last Jedi” mythology-bending, with its disillusioned, cynical Luke Skywalker, or some of the nuttier detours favored by that film’s writer-director, Rian Johnson. On the other hand, nothing in Abrams’ movie can hold a candle to the Praetorian throne room battle scene in “The Last Jedi.” The “Rise of Skywalker” director frames and shoots for the iPhone, by Jedi-like instinct. Johnson knows more about filling out and energizing a widescreen action landscape, interior or exterior. Abrams and company get around the “Last Jedi” fan base blowback the easy way: by making a movie, a pretty good one, essentially pretending there never was a “Last Jedi.” My favorite bit in “The Rise of Skywalker” is a throwaway sight gag, involving the rise not of a Skywalker, but of a couple of Storm Troopers. In this film, they’re equipped with the equivalent of jet packs, in addition to hovercrafts and all the rest of the stuff now on sale at Target. “They fly now?” one of our heroes says. It’s not a memorable line. Then again, no one’s going to mount a feverish online boycott against it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars is for everybody. Star Wars is for the fans. If you’re confused about the correct answer, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—also known as Episode IX, the final installment of the nine-part “Skywalker Saga”—isn’t likely to help. This overloaded finale, directed by J.J. Abrams, is for everybody and nobody, a movie that’s sometimes reasonably entertaining but that mostly feels reverse-engineered to ensure that the feathers of the Star Wars purists remain unruffled. In its anxiety not to offend, it comes off more like fanfiction than the creation of actual professional filmmakers. A bot would be able to pull off a more surprising movie. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker opens, as the Star Wars films traditionally do, with a crawl: “The dead speak!” it tells us. What are they saying? Wouldn’t you like to know. At the end of the 2017 Star Wars: The Last Jedi, directed by Rian Johnson, First Order baddie Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) killed the even bigger baddie Snoke (Andy Serkis) and declared himself Supreme Leader. At the beginning of The Rise of Skywalker, we see our new Supreme Leader Kylo fondling a glowing green power thingie. Pay attention to this power thingie, because for most of the movie…you’ll see neither hide nor hair of it. But you know it’s got to mean something. Meanwhile, elsewhere, powerful warrior orphan Rey (Daisy Ridley) commences Jedi training with the former Princess, now General, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher), who has assured her that the Resistance has a chance to overthrow the First Order. Rey hovers in the air, cross-legged, as rocks float around her. The Force, channeled correctly, allows you to do stuff like this. Meanwhile, Kylo receives orders from a dead person—the dead are speaking, just as promised. Hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) is flying around and grousing about various indignities. Former Storm Trooper, now Resistance fighter, Finn (John Boyega) spends much of his time at Poe’s side being charmingly conciliatory; occasionally he gets to be heroic. If you didn’t much care for Finn’s smart, appealing sidekick and potential love interest from the last movie, engineer Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), you’re in luck—here she’s stuck on the ground tinkering with space-ship engines, behind the scenes. The fans have spoken. Stuff happens in The Rise of Skywalker. Just when you think stuff is going to stop happening, it keeps happening. Characters die temporarily and then—surprise!—turn out to be not dead at all. Or they die and they’re resurrected. To be fair, a few really do just die. But the rules guiding the plot logic of The Rise of Skywalker are conveniently lax. When Abrams needs to shift the action, he’ll just have one character or another shout “[Blank] is coming! We’ve got to go!” One confrontation between nemeses is left hanging in one of these “We’ve got to go!” moments, and nobody is supposed to notice. There are one or two pleasures to be had in The Rise of Skywalker. Many of the characters and things you want in a Star Wars movie are here, including C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), as well as the Millennium Falcon, in all its ramshackle glory. But overall, there are so many characters—new ones as well as old—and so much mythology to tie up, that interactions between individuals often seem like afterthoughts. There’s a tender moment here or there, but nothing lingers—even moments that should carry some dramatic weight drift by like tumbleweeds. Because, you know, we’ve got to go! It’s hard to gauge exactly how many of The Rise of Skywalker’s problems are specifically Abrams’ fault. He directed the first film in this final trilogy of the Star Wars series, the 2015 Star Wars: Episode VII—The Force Awakens. It was OK. But Johnson’s The Last Jedi was better by leaps and bounds—more inventive, more soulful, less mired in boggy mythology. It opened a window in this somewhat weary franchise, setting up a story in which the old guard, consisting largely of white men, would pass the reins to a younger generation, that more accurately reflects the world the audience lives in. It was a fantasy that also carried threads of resonance in that world. But hardcore fans hated The Last Jedi and made their displeasure known on social media. The stakes for any Star Wars movie are high; for The Rise of Skywalker, the series’ closer, they were even higher. Colin Trevorrow (Jurassic World) had originally been set to write and direct, but was replaced by Abrams in 2017. (Trevorrow is credited as one of The Rise of Starwalker’s screenwriters, as is Abrams.) Troubled films are often bland and colorless, if efficient in the way they tick off the boxes of fan expectations. Maybe that’s what happened with The Rise of Skywalker: In working so hard to please the franchise’s fan base, Abrams lost every chance at adding a spark of originality. Fantasy is compelling to children because it gives them a sense of control over the uncontrollable: An enemy can be vanquished with the help of a light saber. You can triumph over evil if you’re really, really good. But this new world order, in which fans decide what they want and don’t want in their cherished franchises, is the enemy of creativity and imagination. The most vocal, hardcore Star Wars fans—most of them full-fledged grownups—don’t just fantasize about having control; they’ve found a way to get it, and their tyranny is oppressive. However you feel about George Lucas’ 1977 Star Wars, it was at least a picture made by an inventive weirdo with a distinctive vision. No wonder people were delighted by it. Now, delight has been replaced with duty. The fans have formed their own empire, and it hasn’t just struck back; it’s won.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," You almost have to feel sorry for The Rise Of Skywalker. Yes, this is a guaranteed blockbuster, the very opposite of an underdog, the latest entry in one of the most popular media franchises in human history. It will make a billion dollars, and you will not. Yet the movie, the last in a new trilogy of Star Wars sequels produced without George Lucas’ involvement (or, it must be said, his acid-trip imagination), is so freighted with obligation that it almost groans under the weight, flashing a weak smile as it vaguely approximates the appearance of a zippy good time. Of course, most concluding chapters of a saga with a capital S carry burdens their predecessors don’t: They often end up feeling like the last act of a movie stretched to feature length—all falling action, no remaining mystery. But in the case of this ninth official episode, the batting-cleanup responsibilities are compounded by the expectations of a fanbase on the cusp of mutiny. Skywalker wants desperately to please them, a potentially impossible task it tackles with transparently ingratiating caution. This is a space opera animated not by joy but insecurity—the anxiety, evident in almost every moment, that if it’s not very careful, someone might feel letdown. Technically, Skywalker picks up from the ending of the previous entry in the series, Rian Johnson’s imperfect but often spectacular and genuinely daring The Last Jedi. Johnson had the nerve to muck a little with the assumed trajectory of this ongoing story, and to toy with the characterization of a legendary hero like Luke Skywalker. So of course, plenty of diehards (and cast members) wanted to turn the Death Star on him. To their presumed relief, the reins have been passed back to J.J. Abrams, who made the first movie of the new trilogy, The Force Awakens. That astronomical hit was designed, in its savvy but safe tracing over of A New Hope, to operate as a big reset, winning back those who hated Lucas’ prequels. Watching The Rise Of Skywalker, you realize that J.J. has been hired to do the same thing here; he’s made what feels sometimes like a glorified apology for his successor’s choices. Remember in Last Jedi when fallen son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) smashed his Vader-esque helmet to bits as a symbolic rejection of the past? It takes him all of 15 minutes to weld it back together in Skywalker, the little red cracks across its surface evidence of a “mistake” that’s been mended. In other words, the thing’s still a metaphor. In the first of Abrams’ many supposed course corrections, Skywalker inserts Kylo right back into the Empire chain of command he emancipated himself from in Last Jedi. He may have killed the wannabe Snoke, but he’s not impervious to the offers of his replacement: the real emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), raised from the grave by some far-side-of-the-galaxy zealots. (Before anyone gets upset by this revelation, can we all agree that the very first line of the opening Star Wars text crawl isn’t a spoiler?) Part of what made Kylo such an interesting villain was that his ambitions weren’t strictly Sithian; caught in the shadow of his famous family, he reached for an alternative to the series’ good-evil dichotomy—call it a free-agent evil, maybe? But The Rise Of Skywalker wants him back in the familiar tug of war, his soul the stake in another battle between the light and dark sides of the Force. It’s all very Return Of The Jedi. And having made seductive appeals to Rey (Daisy Ridley) last time around, Kylo simplifies his pickup line: “I’m going to find you and turn you to the dark side.” The plot is a busy thing, especially during Abrams’ heavily expositional first act, when he keeps leaping across the usual stock library of planet types. (Would you believe there’s another desert world that’s neither Tatooine nor Jakku?) Rey, tormented by visions of herself in a black robe, goes looking for one of the film’s various MacGuffins. Along for the ride is reformed Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), very Han-like flyboy Poe (Oscar Isaac), and ageless fuzzball Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo). Addressing another item from the complaint box, Abrams doesn’t split up the gang like Johnson did, instead sending them on bantering group expeditions. The new class remains a likable lot; they’re the strongest element of this third trilogy. And The Rise Of Skywalker gets some light ensemble fun out of their misadventures, including the rare C-3PO subplot that’s both funny and even a little poignant. Not that everyone has an equal role. Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose, introduced in Johnson’s film, has been largely sidelined by popular/toxic demand. And the late Carrie Fisher has only a few scenes, thanks to some awkwardly integrated archival footage. (A franchise long haunted by the ghosts of the past, Star Wars now involves both dead characters played by living actors and living characters played by dead actors.) Abrams likes to dig around in sandboxes he didn’t build. His only non-franchise picture, Super 8, still feels like one, in the sense that Steven Spielberg is basically his own franchise. In many ways, the director’s bookending what he started in 2015; this is another Star Wars movie that seems more interested in echoing old pleasures—through crowd-pleasing cameos, through recycled plot beats—than pushing this franchise in new directions. But The Force Awakens, for all its play-it-safe retread, was a more stirring blast of pop entertainment. It was better paced, at least, with a first act that took the time to reinvest in the mythic scale of the galaxy far, far away. And it offered a sense of rediscovery after a decade with no new episodes. Arriving at a time when the novelty of Star Wars as a cultural event has given way to something like appointment-viewing fatigue, The Rise Of Skywalker can’t conjure the same excitement just playing the hits. There’s a certain desperation to its action: The lightsaber duels and deep-space dogfights and close encounters arrive at a steady clip, but they’re more like items on a checklist than anything else. The director’s own Force is a phantom survey conducted in the narrow cracks between perfunctory set pieces, nervously and implicitly demanding to know if we’re having fun yet. These movies have  always been about legacy: Going back to the 1977 original, in which a plucky farm boy got drafted into a cosmic struggle, they’ve followed characters trying to find their place in a story older and bigger than themselves. The new trilogy makes that aspect both text and subtext—these are Star Wars films about how difficult it is to live up to Star Wars. Rey and Kylo, especially, seem to carry the anxiety of their creators on their backs, sometimes wondering aloud how they could possibly compete with the reputations of those who came before them. Yet if Abrams preaches the importance of creating your own destiny, and of not letting your lineage determine it, the plot of The Rise Of Skywalker betrays that message: By the end, everyone has fallen into their proper place in the grand mythology, like the holo-chess pieces on the Millennium Falcon. What’s the point in introducing so many interesting new characters and then pushing them through the blueprints of old adventures? It leaves you pining for a Star Wars movie that charts its own path, until you remember such a movie exists already, and it’s being all but retconned before your eyes. Save the sympathy for that billion-dollar blockbuster.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," As the culmination of what George Lucas began four decades prior, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker needs to conclude the Skywalker Saga and directly follow this franchise’s most daring entry, The Last Jedi. That film’s director, Rian Johnson, boldly argued we should not be telling the same tale over and over again, but forge ahead with new ideas, stories, and characters for a more promising, fruitful future. His narrative principles were in direct conflict with the Disney ethos that more of the same will yield more lucrative results. With noted disappointment and little surprise, J.J. Abrams’ finale doesn’t just directly refute many of the ideas of its predecessor–its brand of nostalgia also feels more brazenly pandering than heartfelt. For as simple as the opening crawl is–Palpatine has returned, Kylo Ren wants to take him down, and Rey is training to fight the First Order–The Rise of Skywalker‘s first half proves needlessly convoluted. With no shortage of MacGuffins, most of which have some aural or visual flashback attached, much of the film is concerned with prodding Rey with the notion that there are secrets in her past she must discover. A direct contradiction to Johnson’s repeated mantra of letting old things die, this ninth and final film in the series is wholly about the desire to uncover the past to unlock one’s true identity and honor the generations and iconic characters that came before–an approach so congruous with The Force Awakens that if The Last Jedi was mysteriously scrubbed from Star Wars canon, this trilogy could become a two-fer with very little narrative disarray. If the undoing of pathos that previously drove our protagonists weren’t enough, the sheer disregard for the foundations that were set up becomes apparent in other ways: a substantial franchise presence flat-out says “I was wrong” about what came before, and Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico is more or less a background character. In terms of the rest of the ensemble, Richard E. Grant enjoys his brief, villainous role as Allegiant General Pryde and Oscar Isaac’s Poe Dameron is having the most fun, going even further in his Solo-meets-Indiana Jones persona of a roguish-yet-loyal adventurer alongside John Boyega’s Finn and Joonas Suotamo as Chewie. Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren’s (Adam Driver) ying-yang bond reaches a logical conclusion, both actors doing their best with material that is far less compelling than their prior outing. And though Carrie Fisher’s return as Leia is created from unused footage shot for prior films, it’s remarkable how well her heartfelt turn works. (Nevertheless, certain use of CGI in another scene shows how much further we must go to leap out of the uncanny valley.) Considering its unassailable ties to the entire franchise, it’s nearly impossible to evaluate The Rise of Skywalker purely on its own merits; on a strict level of directorial capability, however, Abrams continuously seems to be scrambling to inject energy into a story lacking imagination. There’s a similar bag of workmanlike tricks from the sturdily entertaining if conceptually safe The Force Awakens: epic push-ins as characters are re-introduced, a camera constantly in motion as if fearful that one moment of stillness might translate to evaporating audience attention. That frenzied energy, especially in the first hour, is also attributable to Abrams and Chris Terrio’s script, which is three-fourths time-wasting, planet-hopping adventures, one-fourth the narrative backing itself into a narrow corner of predictable outcomes. There exist the briefest hints of queer representation and the human toll caused by a fascist regime; they’re subsequently ignored to provide crowd-pleasing moments engineered for maximum emotions that end up forced and empty.  Environments are culled from what is no doubt gorgeous, creatively rendered concept art as is customary for the series. There are lightsaber fights in-between tsunami-sized waves, high-speed quarrels with a new kind of Stormtrooper across the desert, and galactic battles of epic proportions. The scale of these conflicts is felt; the weight, on both tactile and emotional levels, is not. Disney has made sure nobody (or thing) ever truly stays dead, and that cheap trick is certainly doled out here–but Abrams goes a step further to loosen the suspense. It’s not just characters from past films brought back, but mere moments after a climactic sense of loss, there’s reassurance that everything will be okay. It’s the kind of warm coddling warranted for something like the Paddington franchise, not a script with constant conjecture about life-or-death stakes and a fantastical world filled with endless possibilities. Forty-two years after Star Wars changed the landscape of blockbusters, we’re in a world where such large-scale filmmaking is increasingly paint-by-committee. If anything, The Rise of Skywalker will leave some thinking they took Rian Johnson’s outing for granted, and might have unfairly maligned prequels where at least a single creative voice was guiding the decisions, however strange they were. J.J. Abrams’ saga-capper poses the question: when all is said and done, is it more satisfying to simply witness a single, fleeting glance of something you previously enjoyed, or would you rather experience adventurous storytelling with complex characters? If The Force Awakens tipped its scales to the former, it at least had a coherent sense of fun as we met faces new and old. By lacking a sense of vision in embracing what came before and ignoring the recently laid path for where this story could go, The Rise of Skywalker is not only a disappointing end to this saga–it’s also an ill-fated harbinger for Disney’s future in storytelling.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," “Avengers: Endgame” went full bore with throwbacks, payoffs, make-rights, welcome cameos and complete bombast while wrapping up its superhero saga. With “The Rise of Skywalker,” “Star Wars” says, “Hold my blue milk.” “Rise of Skywalker” (★★1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Thursday night) was hyped as the conclusion to the epic nine-episode tale started back in 1977 by George Lucas’ original “Star Wars."" And 42 years later, director J.J. Abrams does his darnedest, leaving no stone unturned – with the Force or otherwise – to tie together characters and themes through three film trilogies. It's impressively ambitious, though great new personalities and fresh storytelling suffer for the sake of fan service. The last time we saw the good guys of the Resistance – Jedi-in-training Rey (Daisy Ridley), reluctant hero Finn (John Boyega) and headstrong flyboy Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) – their ragtag crew had escaped the clutches of the evil First Order at the end of “The Last Jedi.” The new film, though, brings back a phantom menace: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), long thought dead, emerges as the galaxy’s biggest threat yet again. The Resistance is trying to fill out its ranks with allies wherever it can find them, especially with the supreme bad guy starting to cause a ruckus like he did in Lucas' first two trilogies. With old Jedi master Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) now gone, Rey is learning the ways of the Force from General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher, who comes alive on screen through unused footage plus some visual-effects wizardry), and Finn and Poe are tooling around in the Millennium Falcon on missions. Our heroes get wind of the Emperor’s nefarious plans, which kicks off a series of far-flung episodes – from a festival on a desert planet to a snowbound city with criminals galore. But the abundance of front-loaded exposition is as dizzying as a twirling TIE Fighter ride. It’s a treat when Rey, Finn and Poe finally get to the adventuring, not only because there are tons of Han, Luke and Leia vibes when they're together, but also because their taking on flying First Order goons in a wild, banter-laden “Mad Max”-esque speeder chase reminds why these movies are a hoot. ""Rise of Skywalker"" expands its gloriously large galaxy with three fantastic debuts. Masked thief Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) is a reminder of Poe's shady past, and Russell and Isaac's chemistry pops, even with one of them in a helmet. Little alien handyman Babu Frik is about to steal some of Baby Yoda's adorable thunder. And horse-riding, arrow-shooting warrior Jannah (Naomi Ackie) shares common ground with Finn. Yet the audience gets barely enough of them to whet the appetite before the hyper, constantly shifting plot moves elsewhere. It's heartbreaking to see a movie where Leia is so integral and Fisher's not with us, though Abrams does his best to keep her at the fore of a story that still hinges on its legacy characters. Billy Dee Williams remains the essence of cool as a returning Lando Calrissian, and McDiarmid is rightfully creepy as the ungodly Emperor, who frequently turns ""Rise of Skywalker"" into a horror show. Some of the liberties Rian Johnson's ""Last Jedi"" took with the nostalgic ""Star Wars"" status quo are rethought here, so get ready for a disturbance in the fandom. The result is an uneven third trilogy that feels like they've been flying by the seat of their pants in an X-wing. Abrams doesn't stick to a template as much as he did with ""Force Awakens,"" but there are familiar turns that go down like comfort food. You want lightsaber tussles? There are plenty between Rey, who’s still wrestling with identity issues and her background, and First Order leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Ridley and Driver fueled a lot of the emotion in those previous films, and they rise to the occasion again as the lifeblood of ""Skywalker."" But after paying homage to everything that came before, this ""Star Wars"" ending is a too safe landing of a massive pop-culture starship, and a spectacular finale that misses a chance to forge something special.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," As they prepare for their final battle against the galaxy’s forces of evil, the characters in The Rise of Skywalker remind each other several times that if this doesn’t work, everything that’s come before—everything they’ve fought for, everything they’ve been through—will all count for nothing. You could say the same of the movie itself. We can debate the importance of final chapters, whether they really have, or should have, the power to elevate or invalidate everything that came before them—and though the ninth episode in this generation-spanning story has been advertised with the promise that “The Saga Will End,” that’s a promise that has been made and broken before. But there’s a lot riding on how Skywalker lands the good ship Star Wars—and not just for Disney’s stockholders. The Last Jedi was a thrilling addition to the Star Wars canon, drawing the best first-run reviews of any film in the franchise and instilling hope—a new hope, even—that it was possible for a movie to tick all the boxes required of a modern IP-driven blockbuster, and still be genuinely thoughtful and surprising. It was also loathed by a small but extremely vocal minority that was infuriated by writer-director Rian Johnson’s provocative approach to Star Wars lore. The franchise’s controlling entities seemed satisfied enough with the movie’s success—$1.3 billion in worldwide box-office—to put Johnson in charge of launching a brand-new trilogy. But as the outcry from The Last Jedi’s detractors grew, Johnson has sounded less certain about his place on Lucasfilm’s call sheet, and J.J. Abrams, who launched the current trilogy and was brought back to close it out, used the first interviews on The Rise of Skywalker’s press tour to signal to the haters that they had been heard: “I don’t think that people go to Star Wars to be told ‘This doesn’t matter,’ ” he told the New York Times. The haste with which The Rise of Skywalker rushes to undo its predecessor is almost comical at first, at least before its capitulation to the franchise’s most toxic fans turns outright contemptible. Mad that Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) didn’t spend enough time together in the last movie? Let’s shove them into the same frame from the beginning and throw in lots of forced banter to remind you that they’re pals. Didn’t like when they killed off the pale evil guy with the misshapen face? What if we brought in another? And that whole thing about Rey being “no one,” suggesting a radical rewrite of the idea that Jedi knights are made and not born? Well, you’ll have to see what happens there for yourself. The Rise of Skywalker at least begins with a sequence of sublime visual beauty, as if Abrams and cinematographer Dan Mindel are out to prove that they can use the color red as well as Johnson did. Piloting his way through an intestine-red nebula with the aid of a GPS shaped like a glowing green prism, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) makes his way to the planet Exogol, where a new threat to the freedom of the galaxy has arisen, a souped-up First Order called the Final Order. Like Abrams’ The Force Awakens, which replaced the original trilogy’s Death Star with a larger, deadlier Death Star, The Rise of Skywalker’s default approach is: again, but bigger. If The Last Jedi was about breaking with the past, Skywalker is slavishly in debt to it. The first words in the opening crawl are “The Dead Speak!” and the first words spoken are “At last.” In their quest to track down the only duplicate of Kylo Ren’s tracking gewgaw (technically called a wayfinder), Rey and co. arrive on another of the series’ ubiquitous desert planets, whose leathery inhabitants are in the midst of paying tribute to their ancestors via a festival that happens once every 42 years. You don’t need to look up how long it’s been since the original Star Wars. The Rise of Skywalker literally raises the dead by using discarded footage to weave the late Carrie Fisher’s Leia back into the story—a mixed blessing for those still mourning her loss, and her character’s truncated arc, but not at all sure this is the way to address it. Although there’s little doubt that some digital trickery was used to resituate Leia in the new movie’s locations, there’s mercifully little of the dead-eyed creepiness of the exhumed Peter Cushing in Rogue One, and this is one time where bringing back a favorite character feels like more than mere fan service (although there are oodles of other moments in Skywalker that don’t clear this bar). Leia’s scenes, written around whatever snippets of dialogue existed or could be cobbled together, have the clunky feel of found-audio collages, but there, I’ll admit, my desire to heal the wound of Fisher’s abrupt departure was enough for to me to convince myself that it worked. There are parts of the movie that reach those middling heights: moments where, if you squint hard, you can convince yourself the old magic is back. Over the course of three movies, Ridley and the role of Rey have molded themselves to one another, so that Ridley’s limitations now read as Rey’s obstacles. There are lightsaber battles and interstellar dogfights and moments of jovial camaraderie, although the latter often feel like strained vaudeville routines. (If you’re hoping for more of the chemistry between Boyega and Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, you’re out of luck. She’s almost entirely left on the sidelines here with a pretext so flimsy it feels like an insult.) Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio repeatedly fall back on the tic of having characters repeat the same line of dialogue with varying inflections—“They fly now?” “They fly now!” “They fly now.”—as if mimicking the shape of humor relieves them of the duty to write actual jokes. There’s a hack-sitcom quality to especially the movie’s first third, with Boyega and Isaac left muttering asides as Ridley stares into the middle distance. The Rise of Skywalker gives people what they go to Star Wars for, but that’s all it does—and worse, all it sets out to do. It’s frenzied, briefly infuriating, and eventually, grudgingly, satisfying, but it’s like being force-fed fandom: Your belly is filled, but there’s no pleasure in the meal. The movie feels like it’s part of the post–Last Jedi retrenchment, when Disney jerked the leash on Solo and killed plans for future spinoffs by insisting that filmmakers stick to the established playbook. It’s of a piece with the pointedly unambitious The Mandalorian, just good enough to get people’s attention but fundamentally terrified of rocking the boat. Rather than making a movie some people might love, Abrams tried to make a movie no one would hate, and as a result, you don’t feel much of anything at all.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Not that anybody has asked, but if I had to come up with a definitive ranking of all the “Star Wars” episodes — leaving out sidebars like the animated “Clone Wars,” the young Han Solo movie and the latest “Mandalorian” Baby Yoda memes — the result could only be a nine-way tie for fourth place. You know I’m right, even if you insist on making a case for “The Empire Strikes Back” or “The Last Jedi,” to name the two installments that are usually cited as the best individual movies. (Please do not insist.) At least since “The Return of the Jedi” (1983), the point of each chapter has been consolidation rather than distinction. For a single film to risk being too interesting would be to imperil the long-term strategy of cultivating a multigenerational, multinational fandom. “The Rise of Skywalker” — Episode IX, in case you’ve lost count — is one of the best. Also one of the worst. Perfectly middling. It all amounts to the same thing. In retrospect, it’s clear that the series has evolved — or was designed, if you favor that theology — to average out over time, to be good enough for its various and expanding constituencies without alienating any of them. Over the years, my own allegiances have shifted. When I was a kid back in the “New Hope” era, I liked the action and the wisecracks and Princess Leia. By the end of Anakin Skywalker’s grim journey to the Dark Side in “Revenge of the Sith” I had developed a scholarly preoccupation with the political theory of galactic imperialism. More recently I’ve grown fond of some of the cute new droids and space creatures, and also of the spunky resistance fighters with their one-syllable names. Rey. Finn. Poe. They are back, of course — played with unflagging conviction by Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac. Also back is everyone’s favorite Dark-Side-curious emo-Jedi bad boyfriend, Mr. Kylo Ren, formerly known as Ben Solo and irrefutably embodied by Adam Driver. I will say very little about what any of these people — or C-3PO, Chewbacca, BB-8 and any new characters or surprises — actually do for two and a half hours, because the spoiler-sensitive constituency is especially large and vocal. Also because they do and say quite a lot. “The Rise of Skywalker” has at least five hours worth of plot, and if that’s your particular fetish, I’m not going to get in the way of your fun. Suffice to say that various items need to be collected from planets with exotic names, and that bad guys cackle and rant on the bridges of massive spaceships while good guys zip around bravely doing the work of resistance. Mysteries are solved. Sacrifices are made. Fights are fought in the air, on the ground and in deep cavernous spaces where … but that’s enough for now.

 No, I’m not talking about the many issues – some valid, many not – hardcore fans have raised with the Mouse House’s treatment of the property. I’m talking about timing. The original “Star Wars” changed the entire film industry and, with “Jaws,” gave birth to the creature that is the summer blockbuster. Like the previous six films in the franchise, Disney’s initial plan was to release its first “Star Wars” film, “The Force Awakens,” in May (of 2015). But production delays pushed it back to that December. The stand alone “Rogue One” followed the next December and 12 months later “The Last Jedi” arrived in theaters. More than any other company, Disney knows the power of tradition and the company had inadvertently created a new one. “Star Wars” wasn’t for summer anymore, it was for Christmas – which was brilliant for a myriad of reasons. But then Disney went ahead and put out the stand alone “Solo” in May 2018. And it arrived with some significant taint, as a small but vocal majority of the faithful was still complaining about “The Last Jedi” and just a few months later they had yet another opportunity to cry about how their childhood was officially ruined (again). Many more casual fans simply felt overloaded. A new “Star Wars” film isn’t just another entry in the franchise, it’s a special event and the timing of “Solo” made it feel less so. Those who don’t live, sleep and breathe all things “Star Wars” should consider brushing up on the original trilogy and rewatching the first two of the sequel films. (No one under any circumstances should ever waste their time revisiting the prequels.) That’s because “The Rise of Skywalker” has a lot going on and director J.J. Abrams hits the ground running. There’s so much to process, it’s easier if you’re not trying to remember a character or plot twist from the previous two entries. The story opens with the First Order tightening its grip on the galaxy and a greatly diminished Resistance attempting to rebuild itself. The key characters are all back: The fierce young Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley), First Order defector Finn (John Boyega), feisty fighter pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and the ever-conflicted Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). As promised, I won’t reveal any spoilers, if for no other reason than “Skywalker” is jam-packed with surprises. But I will say Abrams did manage to solve one major problem. Carrie Fisher died soon after filming her role as Leia in “The Last Jedi,” and the decision to use unreleased footage of her from the previous films in “Skywalker” raised plenty of eyebrows. Thankfully, the choice didn’t result in the disaster that was the beyond-the-grave Livia Soprano on “The Sopranos.” Fisher’s integration into “Skywalker” is so seamless, you probably wouldn’t realize it was scraped together from previous footage if you didn’t know that was the case. But even with that knowledge, her presence isn’t distracting in the slightest and, really, her character needed to be in this film. Beyond that, well, Abrams jams about three films worth of plot into “Skywalker,” and as I mentioned earlier, there’s a lot going on here. Abrams stitches up numerous plot threads from the previous two films, gives plenty of knowing nods to the original trilogy, adds new twists to the mythology, completes the Luke/Leia/Han storyline, brings back some key (occasionally jaw-dropping) characters from the past and gives closure for Rey, Finn, Poe and Ren. At times it feels not so much like a story as it is a series of footnotes, asides and asterisks. On top of all of that, Abrams keeps the action level on overdrive, with an exhausting series of battles and chases that could have used a few moments to pause and reflect. Still, it’s all visually stunning, although Abrams doesn’t quite achieve the stylish panache director Rian Johnson brought to “The Last Jedi.” (The battle scene in Snoke’s quarters and the casino town sequence remain some of the most gorgeous of any blockbuster in history.) In the end, “The Rise of Skywalker” is not a perfect film. There’s no way it could please every fan and it most certainly will not. But I think Abrams did the best he could with a seemingly insurmountable task. It’s easy to admire “The Rise of Skywalker,” even if you don’t truly adore it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","This ""Star Wars"" made me chuckle more than any of the previous ones.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," In the run-up to Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the final film in the new trilogy, a number of cast members proceeded in interviews to throw Rian Johnson, director of The Last Jedi, into the proverbial trash compactor.  John Boyega who plays Finn, described Johnson's film as ""iffy"" and questioned some of his choices, while no less than Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill complained about the film forgetting the past.  For the Star Wars generation, we're always chasing that first high, when the screen was covered by a starship the size of a city. For me, a child of the '70, the original trilogy was some of the first films I remember.  With his first Star Wars film, director J.J. Abrams gave us a new cast of characters in a series of familiar predicaments —  a desert planet, an orphan on a quest and another planet-smashing weapon. Then Abrams passed the lightsaber to Johnson for The Last Jedi. That film turned Luke Skywalker into a space ghost, ended the speculation about Rey's origin and injected the Star Wars universe with vital and visceral new moments.  The Rise of Skywalker begins on familiar footing, with the Resistance gathering numbers and intelligence, preparing to fight back against the First Order. But Rey is distracted. As a Jedi, she's at the height of her powers, but her connection to Kylo Ren is also stronger, as he tries to lure her to the dark side.  If that wasn't enough, there's another even more powerful presence at play. If you've watched the trailer, you know the source of that frightful cackle. Emperor Palpatine returns in all his haggard glory.  Soon Poe hits the hyperdrive, and we're skipping along at light speed, toggling back and forth between Kylo Ren confronting the Dark Lord, Rey chasing her origin and the Resistance preparing for a last stand — again.  A few new faces make brief impressions. Keri Russell, hiding behind a sleek golden helmet appears as Zorii Bliss, a shadowy figure from Poe's past. Alongside her, we meet D-O, a droid that looks like a wheel with a megaphone for a head (voiced by Abrams). From The Last Jedi, Rose Tico and Maz Kanata make short and almost perfunctory appearances. On the dark side, there's Richard E. Grant giving Domhnall Gleeson lessons in how to sneer like a true commander. In terms of action, Abrams is no slouch and makes full use of the elements. Tidal waves wash up against relics of old wars as the forces of light and dark battle on top. From the Resistance's forest base to a desert speeder chase, Rise of Skywalker is packed with stunning vistas and set pieces.  And yet some of the most powerful moments are the quietest: marvelling at the smug charisma of Oscar Isaac, the only pilot who can flirt through a helmet visor; the single-minded fury and focus of Daisy Ridley as Rey, the perfect continuation of Luke Skywalker; and not to mention another moment, which I don't dare spoil, that could even melt a wampa's heart.  With The Last Jedi, Johnson shocked us, with bold new visions and interpretations. As he explained in an interview with the Swings & Mrs. podcast, he was trying to do for fans what The Empire Strikes Back did for him.  With The Rise of Skywalker, Abrams chooses the other path. Instead of shocking, he soothes. Instead of challenging, he returns old favourites for a final showdown.  This is the result of a fan culture that puts the past on a pedestal. The best we can hope for are echoes of our original experience.  It is a priority for CBC to create products that are accessible to all in Canada including people with visual, hearing, motor and cognitive challenges.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The third installment of the new trilogy, which began with “The Force Awakens” and continued with “The Last Jedi,” brings a feeling of completion, a warm sense of liking the characters, and a connection with “Star Wars” past — both with the history of the series and the history of our watching the series. But the new movie also brings the nagging feeling that we are the ones supplying the emotions this time, emotions that this installment neither earns nor deserves. The filmmakers are plucking the strings — cranking up the “Star Wars” theme and bringing out members of the old crew — and we’re reacting, not with honest feeling, but more like one of Pavlov’s dogs. Here’s a truth that must be kept in mental balance with the warm rush of the movie’s final minutes: For about 75% of its running time, “The Rise of Skywalker” is a disappointment. “The Force Awakens” was rousing. “The Last Jedi” had Mark Hamill’s surprising and brilliant performance. What does “The Rise of Skywalker” have? Everything you might guess: Planets with orange sand and lots of rock. Half-baked philosophy. The usual family revelations (because, in this faraway galaxy, no one knows their own relatives). And, of course, celebrity sightings from the original trilogy. The celebrity sightings in this film come in two categories. We get living actors playing dead characters. And, in at least one case, we have a deceased actor playing a living character. In the latter instance, it’s Carrie Fisher, back as General Leia, in a performance that was reportedly not all generated from computer graphics, but also from footage unused in the previous films. It’s weird to see her, but it’s also good to see her, and the footage was used exceptionally well. How much of this was Fisher’s doing and how much it has to do with the mere placement of the footage is hard to measure, but she has an appropriate and rather moving quality here. It’s of someone who started out fighting when she was young, and now she’s old and still fighting. Wisdom has come with suffering, but also a ghastly weariness. She’s ready to stop, and she can’t stop. Anyway, everybody’s battling, and the movie begins in action, but not exciting action. We come upon Kylo Ren, who is played by Adam Driver, who ought to consider going a whole month without making a movie, just to see what happens. Adam/Kylo is slashing his way through soldiers, in an environment that’s all icy blue and shadows. Finally, he comes upon the lair of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who has a croaking voice and dead white skin, but a witty face you might see on a British comedian. “I am every voice you’ve ever heard in your head,” Palpatine tells him, which is slightly scary, if true. The emperor wants him to find Rey (Daisy Ridley), who has dazzling Jedi powers but hasn’t mastered them. She is the most important rebel soldier, working directly under Leia, who is helping Rey develop her Force abilities. Because everybody knows that the story must come down to a battle between Rey and Palpatine, director J.J. Abrams and his co-screenwriters have the challenge of maintaining audience interest, while delaying what anyone can tell must happen. In this, they often don’t succeed. There are inconsequential battles, and the movie expends great emotional capital on the well-being of Chewbacca, a character much more loved by people inside the movie than in the audience. As for the cameos by actors from the original trilogy, let’s just say it: There’s something wrong with a new “Star Wars” movie when its biggest emotional moments are essentially nostalgic. That’s a clear indication that there’s something not working with the story. Another thing that’s odd — though this might be one viewer’s weird subjective reaction: This time out, Palpatine borders on hilarious. This thing he keeps doing, where he shoots electricity through his fingers, while grimacing with a fixed expression … just back up from the action and watch this with fresh eyes. It’s funny, folks. Yet other things work, such as the strange psychosexual connection between Kylo and Rey, which gets lots of development here. It’s strongly (yet economically) suggested that Finn (John Boyega) is in love with Rey, but saying so is pointless. There’s something intense, interesting and vaguely sick happening between her and Kylo, and that situation is just going to have to play itself out. There are also some nice ideas here, about individual will versus genetic destiny, though to get to them you’ll have to sift through lots of awkward dialogue and sentimental blather. Also, please don’t see “The Rise of Skywalker” for pointers on military strategy. At one point, the hotshot pilot, Poe (Oscar Isaac), suggests that, despite being outnumbered, they should attack the empire, in the hope that other fighters will come out of the woodwork to join them. Many years later, in an entirely different galaxy, the CIA would try that at the Bay of Pigs. Still, for all the movie’s faults, it’s likely that most people will consider “The Rise of Skywalker” and accept the trade: sit through a so-so 110 minutes to get to a strong half hour. It’s not a deal that appeals to me, but if you want to say goodbye to this trilogy, it’s a deal you’ll have to take. L“Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker”: Adventure fantasy.

"Dec 18, 2019"," The malign influence of space nerds with keyboards and a cartoon Wookiee avatar to hide behind are present in JJ Abrams’ purportedly climactic instalment of the space opera we know as Star Wars. This influence – let’s, for the sake of brevity, call it “the dark side” – has resulted in a film which insidiously kowtows to the devotions of the Star Wars hardcore, and in doing so, mistakes cheap sentiment for hard-won nostalgia. The Rise of Skywalker is a cracked mirror for fans to hold to themselves and ask the question: is this what we wanted? Really? Rian Johnson’s eighth episode, The Last Jedi, courted the ire of a group of wretchedly ugly men who earnestly believed this fictional galaxy was built for their personal satisfaction. The knives were out. The film cleaved to franchise lore as a necessity, but Johnson clearly took great pains to create original, memorable images and to make music with his camera – he wanted to do something new and exciting with this clanking old shell of a saga, and more power to him. This new film hits the reset button with the force of planet-destroying laser weaponry, opting for fuzzy critters, cheer-a-long cameos, sidelining Rose (boo!) and a plot so hackneyed you just want to bury it deep in the sands of Tatooine and hope no one ever finds it again. All the old gang are hastily re-introduced (Daisy Ridley’s Rey, Oscar Isaac’s Poe, John Boyega’s Finn) and as quick as a flash we’re finding a doohickey to take us to a planet to meet an eccentric alien, then we’re finding another sacred object that needs to be looked at by another special person which means we can get to the place where the thing is happening, etc, etc. There are barely any exposition shots in the film – it’s perhaps the first Star Wars title to mute the sense of an exotic and diverse galaxy, which ends up badly hobbling the big finale. Everyone and everything is functional and, save for a few very fruity lines readings from old reliable C-3PO, so too is much of the dialogue, which leans very heavily on musty aphorisms and so, so many calls to look inside inside yourself. The actors do their darnedest with the thin material, and it’s their investment in this beloved world that just about keeps things ticking. The tragic thing about this film is that, while watching it, you know that the end is nigh, simply because there is nowhere else for these characters to go. Their questions have all long since been answered, and their virtue is now fully certified. Even when the film attempts to deal with the notion of conflicting emotions and a person being emotionally dragged in opposing directions, it does so in a manner which always emphasises the right way of thinking. Which is a really boring way of going about things. What Abrams has succeeded in doing with this slightly sorry film is to make something very safe and very diplomatic. And when has diplomatic ever translated to fun? It’s a soft middle ground where the pimply basement boys get to feel as if their egos are being stoked and they’re watching a work which slavishly replicates the distinctive grammar of George Lucas’s template-setting original. Meanwhile, the more casual fan can at least say they witnessed this thing come to a close. There are few scatterings of pleasure here and there, such as some nice retro production design touches or an outlandish costume, but in the end, it’s slim pickings. The Rise of Skywalker is not a bad film so much as a disappointing one, a would-be operatic genre flame-out which is way too quick to beg, borrow and steal, and often from the very worst sources.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Fanbrats, have I got a movie for you! Star Wars: Episode IX — The Rise of Skywalker has none of the things that made you howl watching The Last Jedi — no “non-canonical” twists or abrasive exchanges or oddball narrative detours with actors you don’t care about. No more idiosyncrasies, either: The characters’ outsize hearts are always audible beneath their cranky façades, their sides Dark or Light with no distracting smears of gray — except for poor Ben/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the Vader Mini-Me whose inner tussles make him cockeyed, miserable, and extra emotive. There’s no one around like The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson to gum up the works with anything resembling a personal style. Under J.J. Abrams, The Rise of Skywalker hits its marks and bashes ahead, so speedy that no emotion sinks in too deeply. Abrams’s battle sequences (ship to ship, lightsaber to lightsaber) don’t have much spatial coherence or snap, but they look dazzlingly expensive, especially the lightsaber duel atop a sea that’s one titanic wall of water following another. The big battles end with infectious whoops and fist-pumps and backslaps, our heroes throwing themselves on top of one another and crying. Lots of tears in this movie. Lots of feelings, wo-oh-oh feelings. If you hated the drily witty The Last Jedi, you’ll love The Rise of Skywalker as much as I loved The Last Jedi and hated The Rise of Skywalker. Stuck for a new supervillain, Abrams and his co-writer, Chris Terrio, have resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) — not a spoiler, since it’s in the opening slanted-backward expository crawl, which by the way is so prolix I wrote in my notebook, “TL;DR.” Going by his number of mwah-ha-has, he’s more evil than ever. He has launched a round-up-the-innocents operation called the Final Order, which also involves convincing Kylo Ren to kill our heroine, Rey (Daisy Ridley). (Palpatine’s motives change from scene to scene. Is he a little senile? I also wondered that about the aged Chewbacca, who often seems lost.) Kylo, of course, needs no prodding to pursue Rey, now a fully ascendant Jedi. He psychically phones her, sometimes to urge her to join him and rule the galaxy, sometimes just to heavily breathe. (Like grandfather, like son. He has even designed his own cute little Vader helmet, black with red crackle lines.) Kylo and Rey are so attuned to each other that they can have a lightsaber duel in their heads, a prelude to in-the-flesh lightsaber battles that are always getting interrupted. During one, a lovelorn Finn (John Boyega) screams, “Rey! Reeeeyyyyyy!” which is beyond stupid because why would he distract her? He can’t contribute anything, and if she turns and yells, “What!?” she’ll get skewered. It was evidently important to Abrams (and his Disney overseers) that we register Finn’s wo-oh-oh feelings, even if it meant turning him into a blithering idiot. Speaking of blithering, I wanted to begin this review by breaking the news that Carrie Fisher is all over the movie, so maybe her death was a hoax — but then I remembered that Peter Cushing had a big part in Rogue One after he’d been gone for decades. Someday, kids will watch The Rise of Skywalker and not realize that Fisher’s General Leia is from behind a (short, stooped) stand-in and from the front computer-generated (and voiced by who — or what?). But in the here-and-now it’s just too freaky — especially when the CGI zombie appears in shots with Fisher’s daughter, Billie Lourd, who plays a Resistance lieutenant. The technology inspires awe, but ethically speaking I’m not sure we’ve advanced much beyond Ed Wood putting a cape on his wife’s chiropractor and telling him to skulk around like the recently expired Bela Lugosi. In any case, the cyber Dr. Frankensteins must have fallen behind in their task, because Leia’s final scenes are weirdly truncated, right when they need to be huge and meaningful. The Rise of Skywalker is another of those zillion-dollar franchise films where I felt embarrassed for the actors but pleased for them, too, because the money is no doubt amazing and will presumably free them to do things they care about. Oscar Isaac started out great guns in The Force Awakens as spice smuggler Poe Dameron, intergalactic man of mystery, but after a fun scene in which he and Ridley bitch at each other while trying to keep their faces straight, he turns into a grinning doofus cheerleader. Richard E. Grant achieves something novel as the Emperor’s henchman, Allegiant General Pryde: near-total facial immobility, with zero variation in vocal pitch. Grant moves no muscles other than the ones beside his mouth, out of which come lines like, “Yes, Supreme Leader” — said to the drama-queeny Kylo Ren with withering, Withnail-esque disdain. Billy Dee Williams returns as Lando Calrissian with a toasty voice that says, “I’m still catnip to the ladies” — and damn if he doesn’t make you believe it. Someone whose husky tones I knew but just … couldn’t … place until I saw the credits plays Poe’s pop-top smuggler ex, Zorii Bliss, inside a slinky suit and visor: I’ll let you discover her identity for yourself. And on the subject of voices, I wondered if Anthony Daniels had left us, too, because C-3PO sounds unusually high-pitched and artificial, but he’s happily still around — if, unhappily, in weird voice. In addition to other returning stars, Denis Lawson — the Scottish dreamboat from Local Hero and a rebel pilot in the first Star Wars trilogy — does a one-shot cameo that made at least one person whoop. Lawson made more of an impression, alas, than Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a fanbrat unfavorite in The Last Jedi who has been rudely shoved into the background. The fanbrats must be pleased to have been heard and respected. I imagine they’re quite proud of themselves. Despite Abrams’s flashcard tempos, the leads come off beautifully. Ridley is more confident here, more centered, more Jedi. She moves so fluidly that I actually believed she was capable of the rousing backward somersault Rey does, in the course of which she bisects an enemy ship with her lightsaber. She’s a fraction of the size of Adam Driver (a colleague pointed out that his thigh is wider than her head), yet when they spar they seem perfectly matched. Driver continues to fascinate, perplex, and thrill in equal measure. His acting is always a surprise, in part because his features are so hooded that you can’t predict his next expression, in part because his characters seem opaque to themselves, so he seems to be discovering his emotions at the same point we do. For all its storytelling glitches and cornball dialogue, The Rise of Skywalker has the kind of gung-ho inspirational spirit that must have elated the Disney Company after the sour response to The Last Jedi. It’s a dream movie for them — it’s the first Star Wars film that feels like it comes from Disney — as I’m guessing it’s a nightmare for George Lucas. Which raises an interesting question: Do you think back fondly on Lucas’s episodes one, two, and three, which were rigorous and uncompromising in telling the story of Anakin Skywalker’s corruption into Darth Vader but also clunky, tin-eared, and visually flat (dull tableaux livened only by relentless CGI)? Or do you prefer the formulaic, crowd-pleasing cartoons of J.J. Abrams? Tough call. I emerged from Lucas’s films with a measure of respect, though. At the end of The Rise of Skywalker, I could almost hear an announcer’s voice asking, “Now that you’ve defeated the Empire, Rey, what are you going to do?” and then, “I’m going to Disney World!”",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Having relinquished his directorial duties for the middle film to Rian Johnson (Looper, Knives Out), director J.J. Abrams delivers a thrilling third instalment in the latest Star Wars trilogy, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker.
Also returning to the franchise one last time is Carrie Fisher as Resistance leader General Leia Organa, whose tragic death in December 2016 left many fans devastated.
After her appearance was first thought to be created using CG digital effects – in the same way Rogue One brought Peter Cushing back to life – her role in the film was carefully crafted by Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio, with the help of some unused footage from The Force Awakens. 
A year after the events of The Last Jedi, Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) face the evil forces of the First Order once again. Still reeling from her confrontation with First Order leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Rey vows to carry on fighting as her Jedi powers grow stronger every day.
Meanwhile, the ancient conflict between Jedi and Sith, engendered by Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) in the prequels, reaches its climax when Rey is forced to face her fears in the quest of learning her true nature.
Bringing the Skywalker saga to a close, Abrams delivers an action-packed, emotionally-charged and reservedly fitting denouement to this trilogy. And even if the story itself doesn’t win first prize in the subtlety stakes – with its frequent fan-pleasing nods to the original films – there is no denying that the old magic is still there.
Daisy Ridley gives a robust and beautifully layered performance, while both Boyega and Isaac are hugely likeable as they bounce off one another with brilliant comedic timing throughout.
Elevated by John Williams’s rousing score and impeccably crafted cinematography courtesy of Dan Mindel (John Carter, Pacific Rim: Uprising), The Rise Of Skywalker does a great job in joining up all the dots in this multi-generational saga. It is a robustly acted, thrilling and undeniably emotional end to a much loved story.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Midway through “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” a shaken Poe Dameron turns to Lando Calrissian and asks, “How did you do it? Defeat an empire with almost nothing?” A similar question could be posed to George Lucas, who 42 years ago wrote and directed the highest-grossing independent film of all time — “Star Wars.” Now, four decades later, his epic tale of Luke and Anakin Skywalker and (not quite his) Rey has come to an end with “Episode IX.” The trouble is, although director J.J. Abrams does his darndest to finish the job, conjuring up nostalgia like a TV medium, “Rise” doesn’t feel like the last chapter of the biggest American movie franchise. It’s just another well-made “Star Wars” flick. And, frankly, that’ll be enough for most people. “Episode IX” is a perfectly enjoyable action film, with thankfully more self-respect than the previous two Rey entries, which leaned too heavy on inside jokes. “Rise” is rich with the seriousness fans deserve. But diehards will nonetheless find that Abrams and screenwriter Chris Terrio wrongly use their last hurrah to introduce a cattle call of new, unmemorable characters whose appetite for screen-time rivals Jabba the Hutt’s taste for frogs. Do they really need to shove in an abused droid to tag along with BB-8, or a fleeting, masked love interest for Poe? A Sith cult we’ve never heard of? All that’s missing is Jar Jar. In a way, Abrams is guilty of the same cinematic crimes Lucas was accused of when he unleashed his controversial prequel series in 1999. Fans were furious when Lucas decided the Force was measurable in “midichlorians,” and aghast when he tossed in clunky lines about Anakin’s hatred of sand. Will they be peeved when they find out the Jedi have the ability to teleport objects, too? It’s OK to change the rules, but here the new stuff can feel like a stretched means to an end. To avoid death threats, here is a small, spoiler-free plot: Now a fully trained Jedi Knight, Rey (Daisy Ridley) learns of a disturbance in the Force: Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), like a resurgent Voldemort, is still alive. He plans to destroy the galaxy — again — in a mission called the Final Order. It’s up to Rey and pals Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) to find the Sith leader and vanquish him for good — while still fending off First Order supreme leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). Along the way are some scenes that are more in line with the spirit of the original trilogy than much of the previous two films. The most meaningful one is basically a recreation of an iconic, swampy moment from “The Empire Strikes Back,” with John Williams’ same triumphant music accompanying the action. You’ll know it when you see it. Also, while the Emperor’s return is something of a cop-out to give a finite feel to this movie — he’s the only consistent villain of all three trilogies — McDiarmid’s gravitas as an actor has been sorely missed. Everybody in the Rey films, including vets like Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Billy Dee Williams, has been too chill. McDiarmid’s chops haven’t faded, though, and his performance here and Driver’s are the best of this trio of films. Satisfying, too, are the grandeur of the final, explosive battle, and the stoic-but-forceful last scene. That’s when you’ll shed a tear as you realize that the “Star Wars” main-event films are over, not to mention three generations’ childhoods. Let’s hand it to Lucas and Abrams — they did it, knowing full well there is no try.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Temptation: Can Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), full of rage and malevolence — a nightmare figure in black helmet and cloak goaded on by the cackling, rotted, resurrected Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) — seduce Jedi trainee Rey (Daisy Ridley), brave and virtuous, to the Dark Side? Redemption: Can Rey, now nearly a fully empowered Jedi warrior, turn Kylo away from the Dark Side, and persuade him to shed the persona of Kylo and reclaim the name of Ben, given him by his parents, Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford)? And in so doing, fulfill the dearest hope of his mother and father who cherished him? It’s an epic struggle, which animates this final chapter in the “Star Wars” series. And epic it indeed is, full of magnificent set pieces — sprawling space battles and incandescent lightsaber duels — gripping performances and a number of truly stunning surprises. The biggest surprise of all is the resolution of the mystery of Rey’s origins. Throughout “The Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi,” the movies leading up to this one, that mystery has tormented Rey. She has been told by Kylo that her parents were nobodies who threw her away as a child. Her strong connection to the Force has her questioning how that could be so. There surely, she feels, must be more to the story. There is. And the revelation is a shocker. Props to J.J. Abrams. Returning to the director’s chair after being the guiding hand behind “The Force Awakens” (he also co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio), he understood that this installment, which concludes the nine-picture “Star Wars” saga, had to honor the legacy and wrap things up on a high note. He’s succeeded. “The Rise of Skywalker” rates right up there with the 1977 original, “A New Hope,” and 1980’s “The Empire Strikes Back.” In “Skywalker,” Abrams has gathered the old gang together for presumably the last time: Chewbacca, C-3PO (Anthony Daniels, who has played the character in all nine movies), R2-D2 and Lando Calrissian (82-year-old Billy Dee Williams, back among them for the first time since 1983’s “Return of the Jedi”). He has gathered them aboard the Millennium Falcon along with Rey, hotshot pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Storm Trooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn (John Boyega) and fired them off into nearly nonstop galactic adventures. On the ground on a forest planet where the remnants of the Resistance are headquartered is Leia, offering wise counsel and Force-fueled support. Fisher died before “Skywalker” went into production, but Abrams found unused footage from “The Force Awakens” and digitally integrated it into this picture. The fit is seamless and her scenes, especially those with Ridley in which Leia embraces Rey, are very moving. There’s sense of a grand summing-up here, with Abrams going to great lengths to touch almost all the significant bases in the series. As is the case with all the “Star Wars” movies, Storm Troopers are terrible shots, routinely being blasted to oblivion by our heroes. The cutesy quotient is here as well with the beachball-shaped BB-8 droid now joined by a smaller and even cuter droid buddy. And of course R2 is still around. As is C-3PO, as fussy and cowardly as ever. Luke’s presence is felt elsewhere as well, emphasizing another key “Star Wars” element. Throughout the saga, the memory of characters no longer among the living — Luke, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Han Solo — live on in the surviving characters. They inspire. They instruct. They point the way to the future. ★★★★ “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” with Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Billy Dee Williams, John Boyega, Mark Hamill, Kelly Marie Tran, Domhnall Gleeson, Ian McDiarmid, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Anthony Daniels. Directed by J.J. Abrams from a screenplay by Abrams and Chris Terrio. 141 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi violence and action. Opens Dec. 19 at multiple theaters.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Which isn’t the dig that Scorsese might have intended, by the way. (And I will let greater minds than mine — like his, for instance — weigh in on what constitutes “cinema.”) It’s just that if you built a ""Star Wars"" theme park, this movie could play there nonstop. It’s fan service to the nth degree, in other words, and it’s enjoyable and satisfying, if not overly challenging. If you didn’t like “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” because it didn’t hew to so-called canon, well, welcome back. Your movie has arrived, with director J.J. Abrams back at the helm. It’s the last of the nine films that make up the Skywalker story (and yes, the title is explained). It brings closure to the saga in ways that I obviously won’t reveal, but that you probably will see coming. Yet it ends as it must, as most legends do. When we catch up with the gang from this latest trilogy, Rey (Daisy Ridley, who is excellent, her best performance in the series) is still in Jedi training, taking instruction from Gen. Leia — the late Carrie Fisher in archival and digitally manipulated footage, which is kind of creepy, frankly. Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) are flying around, as they do. And Kylo Ren? The most interesting character in this trilogy and one of the best in the entire franchise, particularly in Adam Driver’s terrific portrayal? Well, maybe a little. He’s still conflicted and guilt-ridden and confused. But he’s got plans, and they involve deals with the devil, you might say. Good as Ridley is as Rey, nothing in these movies has been as enjoyable as watching Driver’s Ren hash out his issues. Driver is such a great actor, such a joy to watch. But, as with “The Last Jedi,” this film jumps around from plot line to plot line so often that you can’t help but wish we got more of Ren, or his face-offs — virtual and real — with Daisy. They’re still connected in whatever mind-meld way they were in the previous film, but Daisy is growing more powerful in her use of the Force. It’s all heading for a showdown, you’d think, and you’d be right. But not just a showdown. More than one, as various family issues and identity crises, are worked out, often with a lightsaber. But sometimes in less violent ways. The words of a familiar face can work wonders. And there are a lot of familiar faces. It’s nice to see Domhnall Gleeson back as the often-hapless Gen. Hux. Richard E. Grant makes an enjoyable bad guy as Allegiant Gen. Pryde. There’s a new droid that will look good in a Happy Meal and a genuinely touching moment from one of the old ones. The weight of the entire franchise rests on the shoulders of “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.” In that respect, it’s almost impossible for it to live up to the expectations foisted upon it. After all, how do you end the most iconic franchise of all time? (Don’t panic, there will be more movies, just not a part of this particular universe.) You end it by trying to please everyone. Which can make it hard to please anyone. But Abrams is a crowd-pleaser and a good one. He’s made a film that is unquestionably entertaining and wraps things up in a way that will make fans happy.",POSITIVE

The ninth and concluding film of the original “Star Wars” saga is haunted by so many ghosts, it’s almost as if returning director/co-writer J.J. Abrams (“Star Wars: The Force Awakens”) imagined he was making a horror movie — and he’s the guy being spooked. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio (“Argo”) had the gargantuan task of wrapping up not just 42 years of “Star Wars” movie lore, but also three distinct trilogies and their complicated narratives. They also evidently felt obliged to address the grievances of many fans that Rian Johnson’s eighth episode, “The Last Jedi,” made too many departures from the canon laid down by “Star Wars” creator George Lucas. “The Rise of Skywalker” is pure fan service, for better or worse — and it’s mostly for the better. There’s no bigger “Star Wars” freak than Abrams, who keeps the action constantly going with the snap, crackle and pop of widescreen lightsaber battles, exploding spacecraft and high-flying Stormtroopers, all set to the familiar score by John Williams. Abrams is a master of misdirection: don’t take at face value everything you think you’ve already seen in the trailers. As one character admonishes another: “You don’t know the whole story!” “The Rise of Skywalker” continues the intergalactic family intrigue with callbacks to beloved characters, most impressively the late Carrie Fisher. Her untimely death three years ago this month made it seem at first that her character Leia Organa, leader of the noble Resistance against the genocidal First Order, successor to the evil Empire, would have to be written out of the series. Hollywood magic (and archival footage) make Leia a real and affecting presence. Two other series stalwarts are also back after long absences: smuggler turned statesman Lando Calrissian, played by 82-year-old Billy Dee Williams, and evil overlord Palpatine, played by Scotland’s Ian McDiarmid. New characters include feisty warriors Jannah (Naomi Ackie, “Lady Macbeth”) and Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell, TV’s “The Americans”), who join a cast well served by strong female characters. There’s a new bad guy, Allegiant General Pryde, played by Richard E. Grant (“Can you Ever Forgive Me?”). And there’s yet another new droid, called Dio, who looks like a bullhorn on wheels. Dio doesn’t upstage series favourite droid C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), who gets increased screentime, with moments both humourous and poignant. The story continues and the series concludes with fighters Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) rallying once again with their Resistance comrades to fight increasingly menacing members of the First Order, agents of the dark side of the Force who seek total galactic domination. The bad guys now ominously refer to themselves as the Final Order, assuming victory is in their grasp. They’re led by Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), whose obsession with Darth Vader and his old Empire prompts him to fashion a helmet and voice box that’s even more Vader-ish than before, although Ren’s red crossguard lightsaber remains his signature fashion statement. Abrams may be the most haunted guy behind the camera in “The Rise of Skywalker,” but Ren is the one most pursued by phantoms in front of it. By turns brutal and sensitive, ruthless and redeemable, he’s fully realized by Driver, who has grown as an actor over the course of his three “Star Wars” films, as have Ridley, Isaac and Boyega. This is no small feat given the cornball dialogue, which includes such groaners as, “We have each other; that’s how we win.” No longer fresh faces, they’ve become reassuringly familiar ones in this galaxy far, far away, which we’ve all been following for a long, long time.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Copyright 2019 20th Century FoxNine episodes in, not counting the countless auxiliary expansions and storylines, “Star Wars” is still a place I love to go. But nine episodes and more than four decades since the original film, now called “Episode IV: A New Hope,” the franchise faces some daunting challenges, including balancing the weight of precedent with the need for something new and the expectations, and in many cases encyclopedic knowledge of the fans. I liked this last in the original storyline, despite some problematic elements I will do my best not to spoil — and alert to any possible spoilers before I even get close, I promise. Here’s the non-spoiler headline: I predict that this episode will divide the fans into two camps. Those who liked the last two films, “The Last Jedi” and “The Force Awakens” will not like this one as much. Those who were disappointed by those will like this one better.  Now, go see the movie if you do not want to hear more, and come back afterwards to see what else I have to say so you can argue with me.  Once again, the heart of the story is Rey (Daisy Ridley), the former scavenger turned student of the force and Jedi trainee with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), and her friends and colleagues, former Storm Trooper Finn (John Boyega) and hotshot, hothead pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Let’s take a moment to honor their superb performances, which have given so much to the series. In the midst of all of the action and hardware and locations and just-in-time rescues, all three of them have created vital, vibrant characters who give us a reason to care about all of the action. We also get to see the characters from Episode IV, including Carrie Fisher as Princess (now General) Leia, Hamill as Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, along with droids C-3PO and R2D2 and the Wookiee, Chewbacca. And the conflicted nemesis Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is back, along with General Hux (Domhnall Gleeson). There’s a brief surprise appearance that had people in the theater cheering, and a return to an iconic location. So, much is familiar. At the end of “The Last Jedi” the rebel forces were almost entirely wiped out, with no response to their distress signals. And the bad guys who are ruthless fascists, want to take over that galaxy far, far, away. You might think there are only so many times someone can say “If this mission fails, it’s all been for nothing,” but I admit freely, for me, at least a couple more. Remember how “New Hope” kicked off by sending a secret spy message to Obi-Wan Kenobi? Well, here we are again, with a message from a mole — perhaps we might call him/her a whistleblower — inside the bad guy organization. I do not want to give too much away by saying what they are calling themselves now or who is behind it. I will only say that the message shows they are planning some very bad stuff and the Death Star looks like a slingshot by comparison with what they have now.  So It is time to get Rey back from Luke’s remote island retreat, something between a spa and boot camp. One question is whether Kylo Ren will be on board. He is literally offered “everything” if he will just prove himself by killing Rey, and the glints of red reflecting in his eyes suggest that rage is still his primary motivation. His connection to Rey, including a sort of psychic Skype communication they have with each other across the galaxy, could make him waver. Or, it could make her waver. He offers her the same “everything” he is tempted by.  Abrams was given thousands of threads to tie together, and if what he wove is uneven it is heartfelt and mostly a lot of fun to watch. That is all the force I need. Parents should know that this film includes extended sci-fi/action peril and violence with some graphic and disturbing images, sad deaths, and characters who are injured and killed. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," With Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, J.J. Abrams had the unenviable task of not only concluding the sequel trilogy, not only concluding the entire Skywalker Saga, not only following Solo: A Star Wars Story — the least successful Star Wars movie, but also delivering a follow-up to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, which is largely considered the most divisive entry in the franchise. In an attempt to deliver a fulfilling conclusion, Abrams gave audiences a number of things, from entirely expected character reveals to major deviations from its predecessors to cameos from fan-favorite characters to impressive action sequences. If all that sounds messy, it assuredly is, resulting in a single film that feels more like a compilation of exciting sequences than a cohesive journey, yet has enough payoffs scattered throughout to make for a thrilling and emotional experience. Kylo Ren continues his quest to rule the entire galaxy, with a number of threats, both fresh and familiar, standing in his way. Meanwhile, the Resistance is still in shambles after their battle on Crait, leaving them in desperate need of any assistance they can get, all while Rey struggles to find where she fits in the world. Over the course of his career, Abrams has regularly impressed fans with the ways in which he can craft exhilarating set-pieces and how he never shies away from embracing his nostalgic loves. In the case of The Rise of Skywalker, both of these facets of his filmmaking are on display, as audiences witness one riveting action sequence after another, making it difficult for us to catch our breath and digest what we just witnessed. The moments in between those sequences offer the exact blend of emotional exchanges and witty banter that you've come to expect from the franchise. Characters like Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and Finn (John Boyega) inject the film with its funniest moments, with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) offering the most complex emotional arcs. What makes the film so joyful are the interpersonal relationships, adding a bittersweet feeling to those scenes, knowing we'll never see these characters share the screen again. Characters like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and most of the film's villains serve as little more than cartoon characters, appearing to heighten or alleviate the stakes as necessary. What is truly impressive is that, despite Abrams only having access to unseen footage of the late Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa, her role in the film feels fully earned and never like her exchanges only existed on the cutting room floor. If for no other reason, Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio deserve accolades for pulling off a seemingly impossible task of giving Fisher the sendoff and position in the saga that she deserves. Despite all of the character moments feeling genuine and charming, the overall narrative will leave many audiences bewildered. Abrams is no stranger to leaving his audiences guessing and, while a number of important reveals are somewhat explained, many feel as though they exist merely because you wouldn't have this story otherwise. While it had two and a half hours to find opportunities to even hint at major plot reveals, we are given nothing more than a handful of jargony phrases that we've heard throughout the saga and are left having to put those pieces together ourselves to justify seemingly impossible occurrences. In other instances, it feels as though, when the writers found themselves in trouble on a sequence, they resorted to, ""Well, what would the fans want to see happen here?"" instead of delivering what would be the most earned development. While this will surely delight some fans, it will frustrate many others, though only time will tell how fondly the fan base will look upon those moments throughout the years. Something that can be incredibly difficult to keep in mind as a fan is that the films in the Skywalker Saga don't exist in a vacuum and instead are just parts of an overall continuum. While we might instinctively compare each film to what came directly before it, we need to remind ourselves that each chapter is only one-ninth of the entire journey, both for better and for worse. Instead of embracing all eight films that came before it, The Rise of Skywalker picked and chose what parts of the saga it wanted to embrace while completely ignoring others. Sadly, this will assuredly lead to more division among fans, as those who see the elements they enjoyed about the saga being omitted from its conclusion will be left feeling disappointed, while others will love to see what thematic and narrative pieces are pulled from the toy box of the franchise to bring to a new level. Much like The Force Awakens was chided by fans for feeling too similar to Star Wars: A New Hope, The Rise of Skywalker will draw ire for leaning so heavily into what came before it. The structure of the sprawling, planet-hopping adventure is reminiscent of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones and its many alien worlds, while the promise of a ""final conflict"" and its entire third act will conjure memories of Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. Given that this is the end of the line for the Skywalker Saga, it would be expected that the film would embrace its past, yet leaning so heavily into certain installments and so far away from others makes the experience feel just as safe as Abrams' first entry into the galaxy far, far away. Missed opportunities for ambitious storylines aside, it's hard to deny the effectiveness of much of the film. Whether it be Poe and Rey butting heads about the condition of the Millennium Falcon and Lando commenting on Chewbacca's height putting a smile on your face, Leia's attempts to instill wisdom on members of the Resistance igniting an emotional reaction due to the real-world loss of Fisher, or the conflict of following the path of who you want to be instead of being the person you're told you are evoking philosophical questions, The Rise of Skywalker offers audiences a worthy and, at times exceptional, conclusion to the end of a 40-year journey, though the various missed opportunities will surely stick with some audiences longer than the film's accomplishments.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The greatest sci-fi saga the galaxy has ever known comes to a thrilling and emotional conclusion in this breathless and hugely entertaining action fantasy blockbuster. It's an earth-shattering romp packed with cross-generational appeal which is guaranteed to be another box office smash for Disney, and is machine tooled by director JJ Abrams in his typical light speed style to please hardcore fans and casual viewers alike. And as it explodes out of the screen in a whirl of stunts, special effects and humour, it’s packed with enough spaceships, robots and aliens to keep your kids Christmas list full for a decade. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Oscar Isaac reprise their roles as heroic members of the resistance, whose numbers are considerably reduced after the events of the divisive previous episode, The Last Jedi. That film caused vociferous outrage online among hardcore fans when it was revealed Ridley’s character, Rey, wasn’t a member of the Skywalker family, an issue which is returned to here as she takes centre stage. The villainous Kylo Ren is very much a Skywalker family member, being Luke Skywalker’s nephew, and Darth Vader’s grandson, and the US marine turned actor, Adam Driver, uses his physical presence to great effect in a pivotal role as the Supreme Leader of the evil First Order. It’s a great end to the year for the actor who has been picking up award nominations for his brilliant divorce drama, Marriage Story, where he co-stars with Scarlett Johansson. Here he has a combative chemistry with Ridley, and brings a meaty gravitas to their scenes as their fates of their characters become ever more closely involved. Her appearance has been salvaged from outtakes and unused scenes from the previous film, and has been skilfully and successfully included for maximum emotional impact. Even death can’t stop her remarkable screen presence from providing dignity and gravitas to this film. Luke Skywalker himself was killed off in the last adventure and in the manner of Jedi warriors such as Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda, who in previous films used the magical energy, the Force, to return from the grave as ghosts to guide the living.  Mark Hamill is once again in a mischievous mood as Luke who returns to further harangue Rey as she tries to save the universe, and he does as much as anyone to prevent this from dissolving into a puddle of indulgent, misty-eyed nostalgia. The return of Billy Dee Williams as scoundrel as Lando Calrissian is the sort of fan servicing stunt I could happily have loved without, though as the film seems intent of giving even minor characters one last curtain call, it would be churlish not to let him in on the act. This ninth film the series closes with a far more diverse group of actors than the core characters of the first film, who were mostly white, western and male. While this shift is undoubtedly driven in part by the need to be a financial success in what’s now a global marketplace, it’s a change in emphasis which should be celebrated. And it underlines how the film's core message of good triumphing evil is a universal one, and just as necessary now as it was back in 1977. Although we're promised this is the end of the Skywalker saga and so the last we’ve probably seen of these characters, the franchise itself will carry in future films and TV series such as The Mandalorian.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Time to face the truth about your sister’s awful husband. You know you’ve been defending him only because your even more ghastly parents can’t stand the air he breathes. Lunatics in MAGA hats took endless digs at The Last Jedi, the previous film in the Star Wars cycle, for supposedly bowing down to the Woke Ascendency. There were women in it. Luke wasn’t sufficiently badass. Those sorts of things. Only a total cad would, thus, decline the opportunity to offer some support. Let’s stop kidding ourselves. Though significantly less bad than George Lucas’s millennial prequels, the current trilogy struggles — hello, Martin Scorsese — to satisfy any worthwhile definition of “cinema”. No amount of furious end-tidying in Episode IX can conceal that reality. The film is merely a component part of a larger machine (the trilogy) that plugs into an even larger mechanism (the Star Wars universe). It has no more use or appeal when examined in isolation than would a sparkplug or a distributor cap. To be fair, The Last Jedi left JJ Abrams with so many dangling ends that the succeeding film was always going to seem like a patch-up job. Good luck remembering the state of relations between plucky Rey (Daisy Ridley), tough Poe (Oscar Isaac) and sensitive Finn (John Boyega). We begin with a furious collection of narrative bits that struggle to form a cohesive pattern. It’s as if Abrams opened the door on a room full of squabbling chickens and, rather than making any effort to calm them down, closed it again and let them sort it out for themselves. After a great deal of speed, but very little pace, The Rise of Skywalker eventually settles down into a boring quest for a magical tetrahedron that does something or other. Rey and her team make for a colourful planet that seems modelled on the Burning Man festival and then another that, seasonally enough, looks to be leaning towards A Christmas Carol. The tetrahedron (that does something) is, we hardly need to say, of no more significance than any bag of diamonds in a Hitchcock film. The Rise of Skywalker is here to answer questions that have been hanging around since The Force Awakens debuted in 2015. Who are Rey’s parents? Who will end up running the universe? Who will marry whom? Some reach conclusions. Some do not. The most significant answers are blurted out mid-film with little effort made to prepare or to dramatise. It’s as if some passer-by yelled “Rosebud? Oh yeah. It was a sledge” halfway through Citizen Kane. Jeopardy is dispelled by the awareness that nobody is ever really dead in this universe. Ian McDiarmid is back as the Emperor. Mark Hamill is back as Luke. Carrie Fisher, actually dead in real life, is back to mutter self-help aphorisms blankly as General Leia Organa. Some of the returning deadies are ghosts, but not all. Look, he’s alive. Look, she’s above ground again. By the close one half-expects to see Bambi’s mother return. This wouldn’t be happening if the writers allowed themselves to escape from the pressures of “fan service” and tell a simple story worth hearing. The brief nods are, to be fair, fun for Star Wars veterans. Blink and you’ll miss a British actor who had smallish roles in the opening trilogy. There is, towards the close, a satisfactory salute from controversial plush characters. Domestic fans of Star Wars Island (formerly Skellig Michael) will not be disappointed. The endless attempts to address political and familial questions become, however, so exhausting that it proves hard to care which Skywalker will rise. It's not clear how funny Domhnall Gleeson and Richard E Grant, apparatchiks of Empire, are supposed to be, but Domhnall does, at least, deliver the best line in the movie with some gusto. Yet the component will just about fit in the prepared slot. Star Wars was modelled on John Ford’s The Searchers and Akira Kurosawa’s Hidden Fortress. The current “content” has more in common with the last update of your PC’s operating system. Have fun watching the grey bar complete itself.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Just to lay down a sense of my standards for Star Wars… I am a fan, not a fanboy. I have seen all the previous films multiple times. I saw Star Wars on opening weekend 42 years ago. I didn’t hate The Phantom Menace, but I do find Jar Jar and “Anni!” irritating. I didn’t dislike, but didn’t love J.J. Abrams’ The Force Awakens, mostly because I found his directing marginal at best and didn’t love the whininess of Kylo Ren. I think The Last Jedi is easily the best directed of the entire series, I loved a lot of choices that Rian Johnson made that others disliked, and I would place the film right after the original Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back on my overall list.  The stuff that Abrams walked back from the Rian Johnson film
was slightly irritating, but isn’t keeping me up tonight. (There is one
exception that I will have to wait for a spoiler review to get into.) What made me crazy while watching this film was three-fold. First, the obnoxiously relentless fan servicing. Second, the unnecessary complication of EVERYTHING. And third, the inability of the film to allow the drama to breathe without cutting it off with a cheap gag. Some of the gags are very funny, don’t get me wrong. But it reminded me of a nervous kid on a date, trying to charm with humor, and then when the making out begins, continuing to try to be funny when the tone of the moment is something else. (Laughing in bed can be great… but you get my point?) The fan servicing is something that I am not usually bothered by. Really, let people have the stuff they love. I don’t judge that. I don’t hate franchises or Disney IP obsession or any of that. If the movie is great, I am a happy boy. I don’t see a bit of fan servicing as piss in the broth.  However… good GOD! It felt almost like there was a meter on the J.J.’s desk that let him know that if he hadn’t made a reference to the other films or created a new toy every 2.5 minutes, he had to go back and fill the void. Again, details are going to have to be discussed elsewhere. But it is exhausting. I expect to see a new trick or two or a new creature or four in every movie. But the relentless indulgence of both in this film… too much. Add to that, what is specifically fan service (though I consider both the new tricks and new creatures to be that too on some level) is way out of control. Just try to think of something that was left out and BOOM!, it will arrive. Bad magic. And some of it really feels like trying to add a new skew to the Star Wars product line. There is one elaborate effort to put the pieces of a particular important prop back together… and what is the result? The same old thing but with red lines all over it where the pieces came back together. What kind of welders are these? Don’t they have black in their toolkit? Irritated me every time I saw it the rest of the way. And if someone can tell me the actual need for D-0 in this
film, I will pay you money. Yes, it functions (why is it called “he?”), but It
is not only superfluous, it supplants R2D2, who barely appears in the film.  Something as sensitive as dealing with Princess Leia without Carrie Fisher alive is not badly handled, generally. But J.J. makes many of her appearances even more uncomfortable by adding an actor who makes it a little maudlin.  A lot of people were ticked off by the mental connection between Rey and Kylo Ren in the last film. Well… you ain’t seen nothin’ yet!  Star Wars is not about Jedi’s being superheroes. And the problem with superheroes, discussed so many times before, is that power needs a boundary to allow for humanity. ‘Nuff said. And then the story… you will read a lot of critics who
complain that it is too complicated. But the horror of it isn’t that the story
is complicated, but that a pretty simple story is loaded down with overly complicated
ideas that, with few exceptions, are worth the effort.  This kind of thing happens a lot. One of them, involving a character, got a giant laugh from the audience… but I don’t know if that means they actually liked it.  Also, why are they adding celebrities in new roles in this film. They know it’s Star Wars, right? I love Richard E. Grant and Keri Russell and Dominic Monaghan… but what the hell are they doing turning up for the first time in the final chapter of a 42-year movie saga? Greg Grunberg may be J.J.’s pal, but he remains a distraction… unlike some cameos from actors who we know from the past but haven’t seen in a while. But he is given even more screen time in this film than the others.  By the third act, it feels like J.J. doesn’t want to end the film. Elements of the series that we are all really familiar with are multiplied beyond logic or twisted comedically. One example I can offer without spoiling anything is a line said
to Rey, as she continues to struggle with her origins. “Your parents WERE nobodies…
(long pause)… because they chose to be.” Without spoiling, there is a beat in the film where Billy
Dee Williams, who I love to see, has grin on his face that is way too big
considering what else is happening in the sequence. For me, this was a symbol
of this problem throughout the film.  There were two moments, late in the film, that hit me emotionally exactly as they were meant to. One is a callback from within this specific film. And the other is a beat where Finn shows real emotion, which John Boyega doesn’t get called on to deliver very often. There was also a kind of summing up that I wanted to melt for… but didn’t. But the ending… including the last big battle… not so thrilling… not so emotional. And amazingly, not even as fun as the end of Jedi. Nor was it as deep or emotional as it wanted to be. By the end, I was thinking that J.J., knowingly or not, was taking the posture of making his Return of the Jedi following Rian Johnson’s legitimate claim to having delivering the The Empire Strikes Back of this new trilogy. Whatever issues I have with The Force Awakens, it was great compared to this thing. There are things I would have liked better, but I got why audiences were so satisfied with what it was.  But I found it endlessly frustrating. If they had just decided to get from A to B directly instead of loading up on A1, A2, A3, A4, etc, it would have been improved. Less new stiff distracting from the story… better. Don’t tell every joke you think of… relief. These things would not have made J.J. Abrams’ taste level higher or his directing skills greater than they are. It would not have given the film a truly original idea (of which Last Jedi had a number). But mediocrity would have been better, for me at least. Loved the line, “They win by making you think you’re alone. There’s more of us.”
Felt like a nod to Trump Resisters. Even if it wasn’t, I still dug it. The black waves blew my mind. (I wanted to dive in.)
I teared up during “The Scene” between Driver and Ridley near the end.
Was reminded how much I like Oscar Isaac (who’s been kind of MIA lately: why?) I’ve always considered myself a bit of a “SW” agnostic (the only movie in the series I’ve seen more than once is the ’77 original), so my expectations probably weren’t as high as everyone who’s going to be seeing it this weekend.
But I enjoyed it overall and was pleasantly surprised by how many moments of visual beauty there are.
Had never thought of J.J. in those terms before.
So a “B”-ish grade from me. You…you do realize that the “I am your father” moment in of itself was changing a fact?  Since it was said as a matter of fact, NOT “a certain point of view”, that Darth Vader betrayed and murdered Luke’s father in the original movie? Looks like the movie is taking a beating from critics. I wonder if just maaaaybe SW as an IP was mostly special because of its paucity originally?  (Yeah, I’m talking about IPs and platforms instead of the movie. It’s Star Wars. Fuck am I gonna discuss? Everyone only cares about Baby Yoda now anyway.) It’s disappointing to hear Rian Johnson’s stuff being walked back. Still I’m excited, but now in a Games of Thrones “let’s get this over with” sort of way. I didn’t like Jedi. Mostly for something that Abrams kinda hinted at: I appreciate taking a different direction, deconstructing myths, etc but it just felt like one long exericse in being told what you liked about the series is stupid. And on a dorky point I hate the way Jedis are treated like mutants vs Shaolin Monks. Mostly I just didn’t think it was a fun movie to sit through. I have no expectations for Rise pro or con. I do think Johnson left the story in a mess, no idea who is supposed to be where nor what it is they want/trying to achieve. I’m sure it doesn’t matter to this movie anyway. Don’t care about this franchise or IP anymore after the Force Awakens and Last Jedi and I will not be seeing this movie.  This is from someone who saw both The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones 9 times each in the theater (Revenge of the Sith 3).  But the statement of how the Last Jedi is “easily” the best directed of the movies needs to be called out. The classicism of Lucas’ direction of the prequels puts Rian Johnson to shame. It’s a craven mea culpa tour that shamelessly pushes every fan button in the book to try and ‘atone’ for a sincere effort from a wonderful moviemaker who had the stones to actually make Star Wars interesting again. The whining fanbabies have gotten exactly the movie they wanted. I hope they’re satisfied. That said, it doesn’t suck totally. Say what you will, Abrams knows how to keep things moving, and paces this one like a rocket with whiplash.  The Rey heritage reveal does kinda make dramatic sense even if it’s an obvious retrofit.  I don’t quite agree with Dave about the humor – these actors have an easy rapport and it’s a pleasure to see them off on an adventure as a group again. The new characters worked well for me  – General Pryde was cool, Zorrii was cool if underused, the little dude servicing Threepio was cool and funny.  Finally though, what used to be something very special is now pretty much interchangeable from pretty much any other megabucks movie. It used to be a Saga, now it’s a franchise. Some will enjoy it, some will hate it, and so the wheel keeps turning. “Finally though, what used to be something very special is now pretty much interchangeable from pretty much any other megabucks movie. It used to be a Saga, now it’s a franchise. Some will enjoy it, some will hate it, and so the wheel keeps turning.” There was a headline the other day that I noticed stating that Disney was moving away from anymore trilogies. This underlines what you’re talking about. These things can’t possibly be special when they’re treated like a Starbucks. I love the idea of trilogies because your characters have a story, a reason for existing. A begining, middle, and end. Franchises simply push the ball to the next movie. It’s like professional wrestling: they use the TV matches to push the ppv’s and the ppv’s to push TV.  Cool.
Of course I’m an incurable romantic and nothing triggers my tear ducts more than Doomed Love love stories (“The Sterile Cuckoo,” “Baby It’s You,” “Dogfight,” etc.). David, I pretty much agree with you on most points of this review….and yet I enjoyed this movie in spite of itself: it’s shameless, hyperactive, overly manipulative but I feel like it achieves what it sets out to do for the most part.  This was pretty much Star Wars Endgame and I enjoyed it MORE than ‘Endgame mainly based on two factors:
– JJ doesn’t have an original idea in his pretty little head but he’s a better director than the Russo Brothers hands-down.
– I grew up on Star Wars and have seen every one of them in theaters….I love most if not all of these characters whereas I just love about half of the MCU crew, just personal preference.  The story makes about as much sense as ‘Endgame if you examine them both….actually this is pretty much an ‘Endgame body-frame built on a Return of the Jedi chassis with a ‘Deathly Hollows engine, a Return of the King transmission, with Batman V Superman rear spoiler and grills added on! 🙂 But at its core, it’s a Marvel team-up movie in space for better or worse – if you’re a Star Wars fan and you actually avoid thinking about the story or how it all come together, it’s an enjoyable experience.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019",A fitting end for the trilogy that felt like a needlessly tacked on addition to a story that already had its perfect ending. Minus the updated swap of Christensen for Shaw.,NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Let’s just get this out of the way right up front — if you count The Last Jedi (2017) as your favorite Star Wars film then The Rise of Skywalker is going to feel like a pretty severe step down. It’s every bit cut from the same cloth as The Force Awakens (2015) and makes a point to not so gently walk back some of the big choices made by the previous film. Whether or not that’s a deal-breaker will be up to the individual, but it should surprise no one that a mixed bag of a franchise ends with a mixed bag of a final chapter. The Rise of Skywalker is ultimately an entertaining, affecting, and safe close to a massive, 42-year long story line. It’s fine. The Resistance is crumbling, but Kylo Ren’s (Adam Driver) attention has been diverted towards a priority all his own. He’s seeking Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), long thought dead but actually still hanging on (quite literally via a contraption design straight out of 1988’s Hellbound: Hellraiser II), and his intention is murder. Palpatine has similar plans, although his targets are Rey (Daisy Ridley) and what remains of the Resistance, and the crusty meat bag in a cloak seemingly convinces Kylo that his way is the right way. Rey is soon on Palpatine’s trail too, but her race across the galaxy is threatened by the Emperor’s rise and a final battle to determine a victor between the Jedi and the Sith, good and evil, the light and the dark… you get the idea. “The dead speak!” cries the opening crawl for The Rise of Skywalker, and while it refers to the echoing calls for revenge from a shrouded Emperor it could just as easily be a nod to original creator George Lucas‘ simpler takes on this galaxy far, far away. No, Lucas isn’t dead, but Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi made considerable shifts in the mythology (for both better and worse, depending) that are quietly pushed to the side or ignored all together here. The script, by director J.J. Abrams and Chris Terrio, teases briefly with the idea that both good and evil can be contained in the same person before dropping it like it’s hot, and it’s even less interested in other murky unknowns. It’s a black and white galaxy with no time for shades of moral duality, but as much as some viewers may find that a disservice to the previous film it fits in line with the franchise as a whole. Temptation is one thing, but by the time the credits roll each person’s morality better be locked in place. If that’s your jam then what follows will most likely satisfy as action sequences, epic space battles, and new creatures/bots share the screen with returning heroes and villains alike. While Rey heads off after her pyramid-shaped MacGuffin the rest of the gang tags along and prepares for battle. Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are still prone to banter, Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) get caught up in troubles, and both Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) and Maz (Lupita Nyong’o) get a few minutes each too. The passing of Carrie Fisher left the film forced to use leftover footage from previous episodes, and while it mostly works it almost feels at times as if she’s ghost projecting herself into a scene — but that’s actually saved for a couple other characters. Everyone new and old does solid work, but the film belongs to Rey and Kylo & Ridley and Driver. It’s their narrative, but more than that, they’re responsible for the film’s most intense performances. Both shift between confidence and doubt more than once, and both capture the heart of everything that’s at stake here — a galaxy yes, but that galaxy starts and ends in each of them, and they know it. Both have been strong throughout this trilogy, but for the first time Ridley’s performance is every bit as captivating and impressive as Driver’s, and it works to make the drama land despite the CG world surrounding them. They share several fantastic beats together, but one standout, the film’s standout really, sees the two dueling with light sabers atop a star destroyer that’s crashed into a chaotic sea. It’s as close as Abrams comes to the throne room battle in The Last Jedi, and in addition to being beautiful and exciting the sequence also delivers the film’s most affecting emotional beat when their clash is interrupted. This is still a Star Wars film, though, so there’s also more than a few dialogue clunkers and illogical choices. The great Billy Dee Williams returns as Lando, and while he’s as smooth as ever he’s also forced to deliver lines like “He was carrying a clue,” and “I’ve got a bad feeling about this.” Finn refers to “that ship” during a grand battle, and while he doesn’t point or identify specific markings the whole of the Resistance knows precisely which craft he’s referring to. A mission to disable a star destroyer’s antenna grows ever complicated rather than merely shoot it or crash a ship into it. And still no wifi?! Eh, it’s a Star Wars. The Rise of Skywalker is a satisfying conclusion to the Star Wars saga even if it’s guaranteed to be a let-down for some as a direct sequel. Abrams and friends have made a film for the people who probably don’t list The Last Jedi as their favorite entry, but it’s fan service that provides closure for an epic that’s been kicking for over four decades. It was never going to check every fan’s particular boxes, but it succeeds in offering an end for characters you love, droids you inexplicably love more, and a story we’ve all shared for generations.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker represents the plummeting of Disney’s artistic integrity. Wherever one stands in the divided fandom brought on by Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, it’s actively frustrating how desperate this latest trilogy capper is to immediately win back fans. There’s everything from throwaway exposition regarding Supreme Leader Snoke to teases regarding a twist about Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) origins, a few segments of Rey training with Princess Leia (the late Carrie Fisher) because apparently, moviegoers needed it spelled out to them that she has had an abundance of Force tutoring, but nothing more insulting and inexplicable than the opening text crawl which, from the first sentence, begins with notice about a mysterious signal coming from the thought to be deceased Emperor Palpatine (a returning Ian McDiarmid once again hamming it up). It’s a head-scratcher sizable enough to make one feel as if an entire chapter is missing between installments (maybe there will be something within The Mandalorian to smooth over some rough edges, but it’s unlikely). Nevertheless, the reintroduction to Palpatine is clumsy with his whole story arc seemingly pulled from thin air as a way to cram in some unnecessary added nostalgia. The point of killing off beloved characters is to help the new stars develop and grow as we continue to focus on them, not bring back more villains from the dead with the laziest reasoning and most generic of plot lines. However, maybe that’s the point after the unwarranted and incessant hatred towards Star Wars: The Last Jedi. Also, if you are reading this under the assumption that taking things back to a more traditional and straightforward storytelling narrative is going to bring forth some perceived return to glory, then forget those thoughts entirely. Director J.J. Abrams (Star Wars: The Force Awakens and his team of writers and story artists (a host of names including Abrams himself, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‘s Chris Terrio, and Jurassic World‘s Colin Trevorrow, who was actually let go from directing this final entry) may be hurriedly retconning aspects left and right, but that doesn’t mean the corrective ideas in place make any sense. All it does is further cement this trilogy as a product of two conflicting visions where the final chapter absolutely suffers, in the end probably unable to satisfy few. This is a spoiler-free review, but even if I did layout everything that happens in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, few people would be surprised. Rian Johnson was willing to take risks and challenge viewers to understand classic and new characters in different ways, alongside analyze rich themes. J.J. Abrams, meanwhile, is trying to course correct a ship that’s not even sinking because it’s what the fans demand. Essentially, he’s the hired gun by Disney to cater to their specific wants and demands, but he seems to not understand what that is. If what he does in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is actually what the fandom wants, then that’s depressing and unapologetic willingness to not only accept, but crave easily digestible plot structure and storytelling. Still, it’s hard to imagine many people lapping up the character arcs of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) and Rey. I’m not convinced Disney and J.J. Abrams were solely incorporating feedback from the hardcore fans, but rather pulling as many terrible proposed ideas from all corners of the Internet and smashing them into one rushed final chapter that’s like an extensive menu of items with no specialty. Everything here is basic and falls flat. There is no denying the spectacle of the film, though, which rarely lets up on action and samples lightsaber combat to aerial dogfights/chase sequences (one of them takes place in an area resembling toxic gas which makes for a nice visual) all over a variety of new planets. Unfortunately, they don’t really get explored that much, which is a shame considering one of them introduces a Day of the Dead style celebration that is abruptly ignored for another set-piece. Battles on top of a sunken Death Star and inside underground caves tucked away on hidden Sith Lord locales are admittedly breathtaking, which makes it all the more disappointing that the film can’t quite hit any emotional highs. That’s also accounting for a huge swing and a miss trying to pay respects to both Carrie Fisher the actor and Princess Leia the character during a hollow and forced stretch that emphasizes the worst traits of nostalgia and awkward writing. Despite the consistent narrative woes, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker somewhat sticks the landing with Rey’s journey. There are some double-backs here also (one that seemingly misses the entire purpose of why someone might find her an inspiring hero), but also a functional payoff. It’s at least attempting to resolve things in a way that should theoretically please most people in that regard, but not without faults of its own. It’s easier to just say that while the landing is stuck, that doesn’t necessarily mean the landing is in the correct place. Oddly enough, C-3PO gets the most engaging material; do with that information whatever you will.  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a gorgeous and action-packed intergalactic extravaganza sure to provide excitement, but we shouldn’t be settling for the bare minimum, let alone begging for it. A better movie would further explore the importance of identity and hate rather than dole out the expected reveals and safe conclusions. Everyone from the actors to the fans deserve better; sadly, this is what they wanted. Except this time it’s different; now, both sides are going to be pissed off.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," (Editor’s note: While every attempt has been made to avoid spoilers, this article does commit the unpardonable sin of discussing the plot of the movie being reviewed.) “The dead speak!” Those three words, crawling up the screen in familiar yellow letters, are the first thing we see in “The Rise of Skywalker,” the frenzied big-bang finish of the latest and likely not last “Star Wars” trilogy. There are ominous signs that Emperor Palpatine, the vile Sith lord vanquished at the end of 1983’s “Return of the Jedi,” may be staging a comeback from beyond the grave. But if the dead can speak, they can also give us cause for tentative optimism and maybe, yes, a new hope: With any luck, perhaps the deep, transporting pleasure of vintage “Star Wars” might somehow be resurrected. It’s a promise that director J.J. Abrams, who wrote the “Skywalker” script with Chris Terrio (“Argo”), desperately tries to fulfill with every weapon in his crowd-pleasing arsenal. I’ll be as vague as possible, but let’s just say that death here is never quite a permanent condition. Beloved characters laid to rest in earlier installments return as phantom projections. In the movie’s most poignant trick, the late Carrie Fisher gives her final performance as Leia Organa — one of the foundational figures, along with Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, of a saga that launched to paradigm-shattering popularity 42 years ago. Abrams originally filmed Fisher’s scenes for 2015’s “The Force Awakens,” which established this trilogy’s central conflict between the evil First Order and the scrappy, heroic Resistance. That movie also introduced three appealing leads — Rey (Daisy Ridley), a desert scavenger with Jedi potential; Finn (John Boyega), an ex-Stormtrooper who joined the Resistance; and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac), a dashing Resistance pilot — and threw them into a familiar rebel narrative that consciously if not always imaginatively evoked the 1977 “Star Wars.” “The Force Awakens” made a nice warm-up for Rian Johnson’s “The Last Jedi” (2017), which distinguished itself as the most thrilling and audacious new “Star Wars” picture since “The Empire Strikes Back,” if also, tellingly, the most divisive. What some of us regarded as clear storytelling virtues — a tough-minded view of heroism; a fresh, irreverent approach to an overworked fantasy mythology; probably the greatest performance of Mark Hamill’s career — were rejected as heresy by a noisy faction of the “Star Wars” faithful. I suspect that more than a few fans who were incensed by “The Last Jedi” and its refusal to pander to their every expectation will be grateful to see Abrams re-ensconced in the director’s chair. Even if you simply watch the movie and ignore some of the controversy-stirring pre-release chatter, “The Rise of Skywalker” nakedly offers itself up in the spirit of a “Last Jedi” corrective, a return to storytelling basics, a nearly 2½-hour compendium of everything that made you fall in love with “Star Wars” in the first place. The more accurate way to describe it, I think, is as an epic failure of nerve. This “Rise” feels more like a retreat, a return to a zone of emotional and thematic safety from a filmmaker with a gift for packaging nostalgia as subversion. Still, let’s acknowledge Abrams for the proficient craftsman and genre-savvy showman he is. Like some of his other major pop-cultural contributions (two enjoyable “Star Trek” movies and the twisty TV series “Lost” among them), “The Rise of Skywalker” is a swift and vigorous entertainment, with a sense of forward momentum that keeps you watching despite several dubious plot turns and cheap narrative fakeouts. The unpretentious zippiness of Abrams’ direction infuses this chapter with what my screening companion described as “that ‘Star Wars’ flavor”: a breezy mix of jaunty comedy and bloodless action, high-spirited banter and high-flying peril. There are momentous aerial chases and lightsaber battles, the best of which is staged against beautifully cascading walls of water. There are lovely new landscapes and widescreen vistas (the cinematography is by Dan Mindel, the production design by Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins). The soundtrack is the usual diverting mix of fighter-pilot jargon, beep-beep droid chatter, Darth Vader exhalations and John Williams orchestrations. There are hastily introduced new Resistance allies — one played by Naomi Ackie, another by Abrams’ “Felicity” star, Keri Russell — and obligatory appearances by old ones like Maz Kanata (Lupita Nyong’o, sort of). Best of all, there is Adam Driver, as Kylo Ren, once more the darkly brooding yin to Rey’s righteous yang. In a prologue as shadowy and sinister as a horror movie, Kylo Ren tracks down the renascent Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who orders him to embrace his villainous destiny by killing Rey once and for all. Easier said than done, and not just because Rey has become a Jedi superstar under the tutelage of Gen. Leia. I would gladly watch a whole movie devoted solely to Rey’s workout regimen, which involves a lot of meditative rock levitating and, presumably, some heavy-duty cardio using BB-8 as a medicine ball. Alas, the plot must kick in, and soon Rey flies off with Finn and Poe in the Millennium Falcon (plus Chewbacca, C-3PO and R2-D2) on a convoluted quest to retrieve a long-lost Sith tchotchke that will lead them to the Emperor. Their journey is peppered with familiar faces (Billy Dee Williams!) and dazzling set pieces, including an interlude with a tribe of desert nomads whose brilliantly hued costumes are nearly as arresting as their mollusk-like faces. Along the way, the leads engage in some tiresome bickering — for all their individual charisma, Rey, Finn and Poe never develop any real, compelling interplay — which makes you all the more grateful when Kylo Ren arrives to shake things up. He and Rey duly wow us with the first of many showdowns; their quieter exchanges, in which each tries to persuade the other to defect, are even more impressive. Ridley and Driver work overtime to keep the human factor at the fore of their conflict, even when their back-and-forth starts to feel like a long, violent game of intergalactic tennis. Rey sees the latent potential for redemption in Kylo Ren; he sees within her the early stirrings of the Dark Side of the Force. His parents, Leia and Han, are Rebel Alliance royalty; hers were nobodies who abandoned her in the desert. The “Star Wars” universe has of course long been obsessed with Oedipal struggles and other parental mysteries, not always to its benefit: One of the reasons “The Last Jedi” felt so mature by comparison was its suggestion that we might, in fact, be more than the sum of our daddy issues. “The Rise of Skywalker” flirts coyly with this possibility, even as it pretty much lays its cards on the table by reinstating Palpatine as the ultimate big bad daddy, a figure of smirking paternal evil who has now figured prominently in all three “Star Wars” trilogies. As much as one never tires of listening to McDiarmid’s insinuating cackle or marveling at Palpatine’s ability to singlehandedly power the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, his villainy ultimately offers a too-tidy moral and narrative escape hatch. The battles may be unpredictable, but the endgame is never really in doubt. Look, I get it. Blockbuster moviemaking is invariably a tug-of-war between art and commerce, radical reinvention and old-school nostalgia. Rabid fans, snooty detractors and in-between agnostics like myself would be wise not to harbor any inflexible expectations about what these pictures will or should be. The problem with “The Rise of Skywalker” isn’t any single omission or misstep. It isn’t the succession of cheap “gotcha!” twists that briefly threaten to alter how we look at these characters, only to abruptly pull us back to rose-tinted reality.  Speaking of rose: It isn’t the strategic sidelining of Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), an engaging character from “The Last Jedi” whose minimal screen time here will surely delight some of her more racist detractors. It isn’t the blink-and-you-miss-it shot of two women kissing — a craven sop to the many fans who have wondered if Finn and Poe’s intense chemistry might turn out to be more than strictly bromantic.  The problem is what all these choices tell us about the conflicting sensibilities that shaped this movie and may shape the next “Star Wars” adventures to appear on Hollywood’s endless event-movie horizon. If “The Rise of Skywalker” serves any purpose, it’s as a snapshot of what Disney, a First Order unto itself in the quest for global entertainment domination, thinks of the audience’s intelligence. It isn’t a flattering picture. George Lucas may have a lot to answer for, including his mostly dreadful 1999-2005 prequel cycle, but it’s hard not to admire his stubborn adherence to his own bizarre vision, rather than to some fan-tested, committee-approved notion of what a “Star Wars” movie should be. More than anything — more even than the billions in box office dollars that surely await it — this series needs artists willing to flood its mythology with new life, rather than turning it into another endless replay of “The Skywalking Dead.” Justin Chang was a film critic for the Los Angeles Times from 2016 to 2024.

"Dec 18, 2019"," J.J. Abrams prometió en su momento que ‘Star Wars: El ascenso de Skywalker’ iba a ser la culminación de las tres trilogías de la saga creada por George Lucas, una afirmación rotunda pero hasta cierto punto obvia. A fin de cuentas, se trata de la película llamada a poner punto y final a la saga de los Skywalker, por lo que quien estuviera detrás de ella iba a tener que hacer frente a un reto de enormes proporciones. Abrams ya demostró una vez más con ‘El despertar de la fuerza’ que era un gran revitalizador de franquicias, pero la cosa cambiaba mucho en el Episodio IX. No solamente iba a tener que lidiar con todos los cambios introducidos por Rian Johnson en ‘Los últimos jedi’, pues también estaba obligado a cerrar por todo lo alto una gran etapa de la historia del cine. El resultado no ha sido tan esplendoroso como habría sido deseado, pero sin duda estamos ante una gran traca final con más aciertos que errores. Hace unos días se estrenaba en Netflix ‘6 en la sombra’, una cinta en la que Michael Bay se mostraba dispuesto a sacrificar prácticamente todo en beneficio de una acción explosiva que no dé respiro al espectador. En ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ se busca algo hasta cierto punto similar, pero sin renunciar nunca a las explicaciones necesarias para que la historia avance o a recurrir constantemente a intentar tocar la fibra sensible del espectador. A su manera tiene cierto sentido forzar al espectador a subirse a una nave en marcha cuando eso es exactamente lo que es la película dentro de la trilogía. Por ello, parece que Abrams está más interesado en que sucedan cosas sin parar que en dejar un auténtico sello en cualquier nivel, incluso visualmente, aunque obviamente estamos ante una cinta espectacular, le falta ese puntito necesario de personalidad para ir más allá en sus aspectos más oscuros o para perfilar set pieces realmente memorables. En lugar de eso, Abrams opta por la sobreacumulación, intentando atar todos los cabos para que no acabemos preguntándonos qué ha sido de esto o qué ha pasado con aquello. Quizá haya pensado que la mejor forma de lidiar con esa sobredosis de información era que encontrase su reflejo en el apartado visual, pero lo más curioso de todo es que lo consiga sin resultar agotador. Y es que Abrams nunca se olvida de que lo primero de todo es entretener al espectador y por ahí no tengo pegas que ponerle a ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’. Ni siquiera en el tramo final, donde podría haber caído en el exceso de epílogos al estilo de ‘El señor de los anillos’, sucede eso y en gran parte se debe a uno de los mayores aciertos conseguidos por ‘El despertar de la fuerza’: la unión entre el grupo protagonista. Aquí todo se siente realmente como una aventura en común en lugar de que cada uno vaya a su aire y los personajes se complementan muy bien entre sí. Esto es algo que eché mucho en falta en ‘Los últimos jedi’ y aquí está claro que no se consigue la misma frescura que en ‘El despertar de la fuerza’, pero sí que funciona como buen contrapunto al hecho de que Abrams coquetea en todo momento con el exceso. Hay que avanzar sin parar pero intentando emocionarnos en todo momento. Es sobre todo en esto último donde debería haberse aplicado el menos es más, ya que existen vínculos que esta trilogía nunca ha llegado a explicar demasiado bien como el que hay entre Rey y Leia. Su fuerza como concepto palidece ante la débil base real que tiene. En otros casos sí que se ha desarrollado con mas mimo -el vínculo entre Rey y Kylo-, pero esa obsesión por conectar en el público lleva a que solamente haya momentos muy puntuales en los que consigue el efecto buscado. En mi caso solamente hubo una escena en la que realmente sentí un pequeño escalofrío recorriendo mi cuerpo… y no deja de ser una bien sencilla que sabía perfectamente que tenía que acabar sucediendo antes o después. Y es que ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ no se preocupa en lo más mínimo en lo que podría estar por venir en el universo Star Wars, cosa que sí hacía ‘Los últimos jedi’, sino en ser un cierre lo más convincente posible y para eso prefiere apostar por lo que ya sabe que va a funcionar. Lo hace tanto que llega esa sobrecarga que decía tantos, pero no se excede tanto como para que a uno no le importe lo que suceda. Está claro que no faltan sus buenas dosis de fan service, siempre vinculadas a esa nostalgia que lleva a muchos a volver de forma constante a Star Wars, pero la más llamativa de todas, ya presente en la campaña promocional, no molesta. De hecho, casi es mejor que no haya muchas explicaciones -seguramente sea en lo único que falten- y que simplemente sirva para elevar la amenaza a otro nivel. Hacía falta sacarse un as de la manga porque el cierre de ‘Los últimos jedi’ dejaba cierta sensación de definitivo. Lo que importa al final por encima de sus virtudes y defectos es su capacidad para llevarte a una galaxia muy muy lejana y que vivas una aventura como pocas ha habido a lo largo de la historia del séptimo arte. Una aventura más pensada para el disfrute del fan que seguramente goce mucho a poco que simplemente se deje llevar, pero no por ello hay que obviar que aligerando un poco sus objetivos, ‘El ascenso de Skywalker’ habría sido una película mejor.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," How do you follow up a film that tore the internet to shreds several times over? And then how do you, on top of that, shoulder the responsibility of stamping a definitive conclusion on a franchise that’s been 42 years in the making? Director JJ Abrams, like the hero of an ancient prophecy, was destined to make both enemies and allies with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. There will be arguments. And there will be arguments about the arguments. There will be obsessive deconstructions and overinterpretations of each frame and intake of breath. This may end up being the only film we ever hear about again, until the Earth burns up and consumes us all. But, at the end of the day, this is still a Star Wars film in its very bones, muscle, and sinew. Whatever controversy Abrams might have brewed up with his artistic choices, he still captures magnificently the soul of this series: that unwavering hope that the powerless can win, despite the odds. There is beauty and kindness to be found in even the darkest hours, while heroism and self-sacrifice is something each and everyone is capable of. The Rise of Skywalker is a packed film that barely gives its audience time to settle before diving into the big stuff. Describing any single thread of the actual plot is a potential minefield for spoilers, but it’s obvious we’ve come down to the final showdown. Between the Resistance and the First Order, everyone’s in a panic. Rey (Daisy Ridley), the last of the Jedi, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), now Supreme Leader, are still as self-conflicted as ever. Inevitably, we’ve come for answers – and Abrams, who co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio, certainly delivers them. No matter how things turned out, it was unavoidable that either those who loved or those who loathed The Last Jedi would find themselves disappointed. I am in the former camp. Many of the decisions in this film frustrate me. It hangs several of its predecessor’s core philosophies out to dry and, most unforgivable of all, it sidelines Rose Tico (so warmly played by Kelly Marie Tran) in a way that seems pointedly cruel considering how viciously treated the actor was in certain corners of the web. In many respects, it feels like a betrayal of what came before. The Last Jedi was graceful in its artistry and in its outlook. But The Rise of Skywalker is gleefully chaotic, which brings its own pleasures. To borrow an analogy from another part of the Star Wars universe, it’s a little like Baby Yoda – waddling about, prodding and poking every single thing in sight with a sheepish grin on its face. Its emotions are outsized, its twists and turns issued with operatic intensity. Revelations start to stack up to the point it takes on an air of high camp – a reminder that this is a space opera where two people kissed and then found out they were related, after all. Heroes dash about on missions that evoke the thrills of old-fashioned serials. There is egregious fan service (Palpatine’s presence never feels particularly welcome or necessary), but also moments that feel tender and human. The character treated with the most reverence, unsurprisingly, is Carrie Fisher’s Leia. The actor died in late 2016, before filming had begun on The Rise of Skywalker, though Abrams found a way to work in outtakes and deleted scenes from The Force Awakens so that the character’s story could still reach some kind of closure. But the film does more than just that, paying poignant tribute to Leia’s legacy both on and off the screen. In fact, despite all the fanfare and the drama, The Rise of Skywalker is still thematically rich. It also feels grounded in its world. Cinematographer Dan Mindel, who also worked on the first film in the trilogy, seems to have taken a few tips from The Last Jedi’s flair for atmospheric, borderline surreal imagery – like the hungry, red glow of Kylo’s lightsaber set against a palette of stormy blues. While some of the newcomers are unexpected scene-stealers (including the Shirley Henderson-voiced and small-statured Babu Frik), the film belongs mostly to Ridley and Driver – who swing seamlessly between seething rage and timid vulnerability. We may have reached the final hours of the Skywalker saga (or so Lucasfilm has said), but the franchise remains as vibrant, heartfelt, ludicrous, and adventurous as its ever been. It’ll be hard to say goodbye.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is objectively a good Star Wars film. If you’re a Star Wars fan who’s not Extremely Online, that’s pretty much all that you need to know. If, however, you are part of social media and fandom and the general Discourse Experience—hang on, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride. The foremost thing I felt emerging from The Rise of Skywalker was a need to catch my breath. The movie moves at breakneck speed, which is impressive considering its two-and-a-half-hour runtime. This film never sits still: our heroes—and villains—are always moving, always on the edge of a catastrophe, always talking fast enough to render finer plot-points incomprehensible, always saved at the last second by some twist or another. There’s nary a pause or a dull moment, and the first half is dizzying, motion and exposition-filled, as you struggle to remember what the mission was before everyone is fleeing the scene again. This can become tiresome—it’s difficult to feel that the stakes are ever real when we can almost certainly expect someone to save the day and someone else to provide a hard-to-find object or discover an impossible solution at an improbable moment. This is an effective way to keep you on the edge of your seat, but it did make me wish that the audience and the characters got a bit more room to breathe. Even so, the sense of being on constantly uneven ground is exciting. Such a quick pace is necessary to fit in so much activity, and there is a lot of activity. There are giant set pieces, far-flung planets and hidden worlds, markets and cantinas and the inside of many a rustbucket ship. There are a lot of colorful alien races rendered through top-notch effects and makeup. There are a lot of haphazardly drawn plans and fuzzy goals. At heart, I feel as though the movie also owes a debt to another famed Harrison Ford series—it tips its hat to Indiana Jones, even if a central quest to uncover an object that leads to other objects is just so much filler to move our players around on the board. Ultimately, the plotting or plausibility of the set-ups don’t matter much because we’re not here for seamless linear progression or logical thinking in our space opera, we’re here for the characters we’ve long loved and those we’ve come to know in the new trilogy. And on character moments, this movie delivers, for both good and ill. There’s a lot of fan service for longterm and long-invested Star Wars fans (significant swathes of what happens would be head-scratching to the uninitiated). Fans of new heroes Rey, Finn, and Poe (played by a stalwart Daisy Ridley, an earnest John Boyega, and a charismatic Oscar Isaac) will be thrilled to know the golden trio finally spends a lot of time together. They were all split up in The Last Jedi, and they’re much stronger as a unit; it’s a lovely, tight-knit team, not without its internal frictions. There’s also a lot to do here for Adam Driver’s very tall and very broody bad guy Kylo Ren; the movie is divided more between hero/villain perspectives than we’re used to seeing in Star Wars. And of course, there are precious moments to pass with the late Carrie Fisher’s General Leia Organa. Fisher’s death, and the subsequent need to use previously shot footage and sleight-of-hand to include Leia, no doubt shaped the direction of this story. She’s given a rightful and respectful place of honor. While being as vague as possible about specifics, Rey, Finn, Poe, and their droid pals are looking for something important, while Kylo Ren is seeking to stop them, greater machinations lurk in the shadows, and friends old and new join the fight. I’m not sure what else I can say about what propels everyone forward without spoiling a good deal, so I’m not going to try. My biggest problems with The Last Jedi were the dragging side-plots that didn’t seem to add much to the narrative, and a sense that some characters were “out of character.” My biggest problem with The Force Awakens was that it felt as though someone was going through a “How to make a Star Wars movie” checklist and crossing out each scenario one by one. The Rise of Skywalker feels more assured and inspired, and now the characters have earned enough screentime to make us care about them. I’m an ardent Star Wars fan, but I never felt the emotional connection to the new guard that has so resonated with some of my friends. That being said, this is probably my favorite movie of the trilogy. It has a lot of fun while also pulling relentlessly at heartstrings and turning on the waterworks. I cried in the second half and meant it. It’s hard not to feel like this movie is a poignant goodbye to a milieu so many different generations of us grew up immersed in, even if everything is staged to the max to evoke said poignancy. In terms of the various Discourse debates that will seize the Internet, there are likely going to be a lot, especially in TROS’s choices regarding romance, people of color, families, good and bad guys, and sexuality (after teasing that we have to wait and see for representation, there is indeed a minor blink-and-you-miss-it queer moment, which seems to be what we’re supposed to settle for these days and be glad of the scraps). If this weren’t a plot-spoiler-free review, there are a thousand points and decisions I’d like to nitpick, take issue with, and argue about, but this isn’t the space for it. So stepping back to look at the movie as a whole, I can say that it’s a satisfying experience—sometimes surprising, but all the more interesting when it isn’t trying too hard to surprise and just lets the characters be themselves and discover new facets of who they can be. J.J. Abrams directed both TFA and TROS, so it tracks that those movies feel more alike than Rian Johnson’s middle-child TLJ, but it seems as though Abrams has gone out of his way to undo many of Johnson’s decisive plot decisions and characterizations. Where Johnson lay stitches, Abrams has ripped them out. The Rise of Skywalker essentially starts with a blank slate, which is sure to thrill Last Jedi haters, except for how much of the action hinges on Rey, who is a girl, so there may still be some people taking issue with that. I love the idea of a new generation growing up with a woman as their foremost Force-wielding hero, and another woman as the Resistance’s capable and adored leader. Some of the bigger twists in the film will have long been predicted if you pay attention to these sorts of predictions, and I have problems with several of them that I will no doubt be unpacking in future pieces. In short, though I do not agree with quite a few of Abrams’ choices, I can also see why they were made. But I’m not deep in the current Star Wars fandom, and without a real horse in this race, I had an excellent time watching The Rise of Skywalker. (Those with horses in the race for a particular character or ship may be considerably less enthusiastic.) It ticks all the boxes for Star Wars, and it wraps most things up that it needs to, even if the paths it takes there will feel rocky and questionable to some viewers. It’s also hard to believe that we’ve reached the end of the line, and with the advent of Disney+, who knows if we really have? I think it will take a few more days and maybe even a few more viewings to fully process how I feel about this concluding chapter. There’s still room for many further stories to be told in this particular galaxy; if Rise of Skywalker has a message beyond “we’re stronger together,” it’s that nothing lost must remain that way for long.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Director/ co-writer J.J. Abrams’ STAR WARS: THE RISE OF
SKYWALKER is not the worst third chapter of a fan-favored franchise with
cherished characters to have been released this year. That dubious honor is
reserved for GLASS. However, it runs a close second to it. He and screenwriter Chris
Terrio (working from a story also by Derek Connolly and Colin Trevorrow) have
crafted an emotionally bereft picture severely lacking in gravitas, pathos, or
any bold risk-taking that inspired this modern Skywalker series. With lazy conventions
and convolution, puddle-deep platitudes and cheap nods to nostalgia, this saga
concludes on a wildly unsatisfactory note.  The final piece in the puzzle involves getting the gang back
together after being split apart in THE LAST JEDI. Finn (John Boyega), Poe
(Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) are looking to reunite with Rey
(Daisy Ridley), who’s deep in her Jedi training with General Leia (Carrie
Fisher). The Resistance has caught wind that there’s a burgeoning yet
thoroughly familiar foe threatening to take over the galaxy. This evil adversary
has been nurturing the dark force festering and raging inside our favorite bad
boy, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), who’s still attempting to sway Rey onto his side. In
order to defeat the uprising of that potential menace, the four friends set out
on a quest to save humanity.  Moments that do land are fleeting. Rey fighting Kylo Ren on
a battleground with greater symbolic ties, meaning and subtext, as stormy ocean
waters lash against them, manages to be one of the more indelible sequences. Spectacle
isn’t given much time to manifest, but a few shots, like those highlighting the
sheer magnitude of the First Order’s star destroyer fleet, are imposing and where
the terror is tangible.  That said, after being three films deep in the new trilogy, it’s hard to grasp a sense of who these main characters are outside of mimeographed iterations of the original trilogy’s heroes and villains. Though Rey and Kylo have established motivations, Finn and Poe are allotted little to no character development in this chapter. Both have matured into unrecognizable, dulled portraits of what they were originally positioned to be in THE FORCE AWAKENS and carried through to THE LAST JEDI. Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who was a pivotal force in the previous feature, is sidelined, essentially relegated to reacting to a monitor for two-thirds of her screen-time. New characters, Zora Bliss (Keri Russell) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie), are also dealt a disservice, both cast primarily as love interests, secondarily as vapid lip-service to “strong female characters.” In fact, Zora’s gibberish-speaking creature sidekick upstages her as the film’s MVP. There are positive, healthy sentiments fused into the thematic text about how evil lurks in the shadows, isolating in order to manipulate. And while that’s threaded throughout, it’s reductive and trite. Unfortunately this is a soulless entity, missing a large portion of compelling character-drive and impressive action set pieces – ingredients necessary to propagating its message with power and poignancy.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," Dir: JJ Abrams; Starring: Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Ian McDiarmid, Anthony Daniels, Keri Russell, Kelly Marie Tran, Domhnall Gleeson, Richard E Grant. 12A cert, 142 mins. Imagine a round of the parlour game Consequences in which every fold of the paper cost $200 million. That, effectively, is the new Star Wars trilogy. Its three instalments, starting with 2015’s The Force Awakens, are supposed to be intimately interconnected, yet each was written at speed, by different people, and without the foggiest plan as to where the story should or even could go next. Via 2017’s The Last Jedi, whose bold creative strokes, depending on your social media bubble of choice, either revitalised the franchise or eternally befouled it, we have now reached the concluding chapter, and thus The Great Unfolding. George Lucas’s original, 1977-born trilogy came together in much the same way, although for viewers in their 30s and younger, it never felt like it: the three films have always existed as an immutable set. Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia all turning out to be related isn’t a screeching mid-franchise change of course; it’s just what happens in Star Wars. What happens in this Star Wars, courtesy of director JJ Abrams and his co-writer Chris Terrio, is often no less improbable, and for the subset of fans who’ve been following the backstage dramas at Lucasfilm like a soap opera – the departing directors, the high-speed rewrites and so on – much of The Rise of Skywalker might feel like it rebukes or rejects what came before, or at the very least serves as a dig in the ribs for anyone who’s spent the last two years, or four, or 42, feverishly invested in a particular idea of how things should play out. In reality, though, it’s just the last few strokes of the zig-zag: characters change and plots twist in ways that are both drastic and fit a pattern established a long time ago in a galaxy… well, you get the picture. Striking this in-many-ways insane balance is the key to every successful Star Wars film: it should be full of things the series has technically never shown you before, but which also somehow immediately feel like classic Star Wars. On these grounds – aside from an oddly anxious opening ten minutes that plays as if the film is fast-forwarding to the point at which it wants to pick up – The Rise of Skywalker is a roaring success. The desert planet Pasaana, with its bustling kite festival and hell-for-leather canyon pursuit, the snowy castle town on Kijimi with its maze of narrow alleyways, the sepulchral Sith home world of Exogol – each plays host to exactly the kind of swashbuckling and fantasy adventures that are the series’ stock-in-trade, and are brought to life with levels of spectacle, detail and wonder unparalleled on the current blockbuster scene.  From the last of these emanates the dread croak of the Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), which is once again ringing out over the galactic airwaves – a new threat to the heroic Resistance led by General Leia (the late Carrie Fisher), and largely embodied by the three original Force Awakens heroes, junior Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley), repentant stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) and ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Their Last Jedi colleagues – notably Kelly Marie Tran’s Rose Tico, a target of much fanboy ire in the past – are mostly left to awkwardly potter around back at base camp with a new rebel officer played by Dominic Monaghan, who looks as if he’s here on an exchange trip from Middle Earth. Fisher’s appearances here have been constructed from deleted scenes and outtakes from the previous films, which largely works, though for obvious reasons her lines have a certain magic-eight-ball vagueness in context. But the quickfire chemistry between Abrams’s favoured trio is undeniable: I could honestly watch this lot sink into quicksand and scuttle past stormtroopers all day and night. A resurrected Emperor also spells bad news for Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the young and impetuous supreme leader of the evil First Order. Yet his older subordinates are rather keener on the prospect of a return to the old ways, not least Allegiant General Pryde, played by Richard E Grant with his face contorted into a permanent blocked-drain sneer.  Abrams’ DNA-level understanding of Star Wars is rooted in the franchise’s craftsmanship rather than its lore: he knows that the bad guys should look like the cream of British repertory theatre, that exploding planets have a powdery tactility, and alien creatures a rubbery weight that makes them every bit as present as their human co-stars. (A pint-sized droidsmith called Babu Frik, endearingly voiced by Shirley Henderson, is the best of almost too many new additions on this front.) The Emperor may be more terrifying here than ever before, not because of any on-trend lean into grit, but because the basics – performance, lighting and make-up – are exactly right. In its headlong rush towards the finish line, The Rise of Skywalker does often feel as if it’s trying to cram in as much Star Wars as possible before the film series is put on hiatus, like a schoolboy scribbling wildly in an exam before the fateful pens-down moment. Even so, the tension and bond between Ridley and Driver’s characters has been elegantly fleshed out from The Last Jedi, and gives the film a surprisingly intimate core, even when its final act gets positively Wagnerian.  A lightsaber duel between the two on the prow of the half-sunken Death Star is one of the series’ purest and best: an emotionally charged battle of wills, rather than an elaborately choreographed flurry of swipes and swoops. As for the much-mulled question of the orphaned Rey’s parentage, the truth turns out to be ridiculous – but it also makes perfect thematic sense, whatever the fan-theory diehards on all sides may claim.  The Rise of Skywalker completes a saga no one sane screenwriter would have dreamt up from scratch, but does so with such pluck and showmanship that the result feels strangely precious: a busked epic whose every individual move comes straight from the heart.

"Dec 18, 2019"," This is it. 42 years after A New Hope brought Star Wars into our lives (yes, we know it wasn't originally called that), Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker brings the Skywalker Saga to an end. Similar to the challenge that Anthony and Joe Russo faced with Avengers: Endgame earlier this year, JJ Abrams faced a daunting task bringing a beloved series to a satisfying end.  When he revived Star Wars with The Force Awakens, some fans accused him repeating the beats of A New Hope. Others thought it brought back the Star Wars they loved. When Rian Johnson took over the mantle for The Last Jedi, some fans thought it wasn't ""Star Wars enough"", while others loved it for delivering genuine surprises. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a lot of movie and is far from flawless, but overall, it's an emotional, thrilling and satisfying end to the Skywalker Saga, with plenty of surprises up its sleeve. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has been kept under such a cloak of secrecy that it's hard to know what we can tell you of the plot. What we feel safe in saying is that it takes place around a year after the events of The Last Jedi, with the Resistance – left in tatters at the end of the last movie – having to pull together for one final battle with the First Order.  Everything else is a topic for another day (don't worry, we will be publishing our every thought in the coming days) and, like with The Last Jedi, there are bound to be endless debates over the decisions made by Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio. They were never going to please every fan with every decision, after all.  It does take its time to get going, though. The first act has to catch us up with a lot of characters, and it doesn't do it entirely smoothly. It's not helped by the big piles of exposition it has to lay out to set up the main arc of the movie – which involves what turns out to be a MacGuffin.  And there's also that big return to sort out, but we'll leave it out of here in case you haven't even seen the first trailer. It's extremely entertaining to watch all of the lead actors interact with each other for the first time this trilogy. However, before you say that's a fault of the other movies, if we'd seen it before, we wouldn't appreciate it as much. From the moment they head to the desert seen in the first trailer, the pacing does not let up and the action increases in scale, rivalling Avengers: Endgame at times. Everything you expect from a Star Wars movie is there from the thrilling aerial battles to the dramatic lightsaber clashes, via some classic sleuthing in enemy territory.  It's here where The Rise of Skywalker shines with emotional beats that fans won't forget, as well as crowd-pleasing payoffs that have been decades in the making. It's fan service, but  done in service of the plot and not just thrown in for the sake of it. As for the cast, it's a struggle to make much of an impact for the newcomers, although Naomi Ackie leaves the biggest impression as Jannah. (Special shout-out as well goes to the cheeky scamp Babu Frik.) It's truly wonderful to see Billy Dee Williams back as smoothest pilot in the galaxy Lando Calrissian and he certainly gets his moments, while Abrams has done an excellent job in seamlessly putting Leia into the plot and giving Carrie Fisher a fitting send-off. John Boyega and Oscar Isaac are as charismatic as ever, but it's Rey and Kylo Ren who form the core of the movie. We always knew Driver could deliver, yet Ridley matches him with her most mature performance to date. They have the big moments – and they nail them. Given the task that Abrams faced when he returned to the franchise, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an impressive achievement. It won't please everybody, of course, but there will be plenty who find it ends the Skywalker Saga on a high. ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Dec 18, 2019"," (I tried my best to keep this spoiler free but if you are someone who wants to know literally nothing about the film than see the movie first). Sitting down to write this review of  Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker feels like a hopeless endeavor. If I like it than I am a Disney shill. If I hate it than I’m a nostalgia tinged hater. However, I am going to show some confidence in you my readers and trust that you will be reasonable. Let’s start out talking about what I want from a Star Wars movie. My favorite from the series is the original film now titled Star Wars Ep 4: A New Hope. I get that Empire Strikes Back is the deeper entry with stunning cinematography and quite possibly the best twist in the history of film. I just happen to think that A New Hope is more of a good time. A New Hope is an adventure that makes me want to stand up and cheer as the good guys blow up the death star! I like getting to know our characters and keeping the narrative small and succinct. Being I watch Star Wars to have a rousing space adventure you can imagine my disappointment in the last few entries from Disney. I didn’t care for Rogue One and especially didn’t like Star Wars Ep 8: The Last Jedi (Solo: A Star Wars Story was entertaining but was hurt by the most annoying droid in the history of Star Wars L3). I know some people love it but I disagreed with most of the choices they made especially with how they treated Luke and Leia. To be honest it bummed me out. All that said, let’s talk about the new film Star Wars Ep 9: The Rise of Skywalker. As is expected with Star Wars these days some people will not like this film, and I can understand why. It’s a flawed, messy film but it recaptures the spirit of adventure I love in Star Wars. There’s a corny innocence to the film I missed in The Last Jedi and it made me happy watching it. Just as in A New Hope there are a lot of moments in Rise of Skywalker that will make you want to cheer as good defeats evil and our scrappy band of resistance fighters are aided at just the right moment. That kind of action and comradery is Star Wars to me.  Again to use A New Hope as an example it is full of cheesy lines, obvious heroes and villains and it even ends with a medal ceremony for the good guys. That’s the kind of spirit Rise of Skywalker aims for and achieves. Defenders of The Last Jedi will probably be disappointed because a lot of that film is retconned. Honestly I think you hardly need to watch it any more. At the very least almost every divisive element is either forgotten about or barely touched on, which was fine by me! They also did a great job handling the passing of Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. Through mostly leftover scenes from The Force Awakens they were able to make her a bigger part that I anticipated and it was a nice way to leave her after my frustrations with her treatment in The Last Jedi. They also try their best to wrap everything up from 9 movies (an impossible task) and throw in a lot of fan service, which the most part, I enjoyed. For example, the ewoks make a brief appearance for no reason except to say to fans ‘oh look at those fun ewoks’. I know some will be annoyed by this but I thought it was fun. This whole movie was corny, light, energetic Star Wars.  The downside to Rise of Skywalker is there are a lot of characters and plot. For example, just in villains there is Kylo Ren, Hux, Palpatine and General Pryde played by Richard E Grant. Tons of pre-existing characters  get storylines and we have new characters like Zorri Bliss played by Kerri Russell or Jannah played by Naomi Ackle who make no impression and seem superfluous to the story. Lando, Chewie, C3PO, Leia, Rey, Kylo Ren, Poe, Finn, Hux, Palpatine, the list goes on all have storylines and it feels crowded for one movie. You also don’t have as long to enjoy a moment because you are swifted off to the next plotpoint that must be wrapped up at the end of the film. Even though I enjoyed the corniness there are definitely some reveals that push the limit, and I am sure do not hold up under deep scrutiny (expect many a raging fan video to come out about A LOT in this movie and they won’t be wrong). However, Rise of Skywalker was still a fun adventure where the good guys beat the bad guys with great music, energetic action and brisk pacing which kept me engaged. They retconned what I wanted  and ended the Skywalker saga in a place I am happy with. Thank you for the spoiler free review! I wasn’t planning to go see this movie as I’ve been so disappointed with the last several – especially how Luke was handled. But now I’m curious about if they improved things enough to give it a chance. With so many others on social media being quick to gush or rant about this film, it’s good to know we can count on you to give a fair and balanced review that gives the reader a good indication of whether they’ll like it or not. I still won’t be seeing the film at the cinema, but I’ll probably take a look at it some time later.",POSITIVE

"Dec 18, 2019"," The end of Star Wars? Probably not. There will be more to come. Instead, this newest installment denotes a farewell to the characters and stories that once began as the daydreams of an independent director, and now populate the coffers of a media empire. JJ Abrams returns to the franchise to conclude a story that’s taken over 40 years to tell. Nevertheless, his Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is bereft of ambition, excitement, and grand ideals. It’s a languid dull tale that acts far more as a warning against the powers of pop culture in the face of art, than as a compelling picture.  For instance, there are no plot spoilers for The Rise of Skywalker because there’s no plot. Sure a couple of revelations will cause a general pearl clutching sensation for die-hard fans, but Abrams’ film drips with the malaise of fan service disguised as macguffins. That is, the filmmaker commits the greatest sin of all: He co-opts his vision to appease first, and create second. Unfortunately, I now struggle to conjure up what I liked about the film. The character arcs of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Isaac) all take a massive step back. Even so, a bevy of strong performances from the cast admittedly provide The Rise of Skywalker with a slightly graceful limp, especially the bromance between Finn and Poe. They inject a playful radiance into this tedious string of events.  New characters are introduced like D-O (a droid), Jannah (Naomi Ackie), and General Pryde (Richard E. Grant), but are never handled with the care required to shape them from new-line merch into critical narrative elements. Nevertheless, the picture’s treatment of Leia (Carrie Fisher)—the only component that’s artfully composed—hints at the emotional payoff Abrams probably wanted his entire film to emit. That same emotion only arrives as a trickle in the form of Lando (Billy Dee Williams) and Chewie (Joonas Suotamo), and C-3PO (Anthony Davis) taking center stage. But in totality, the material doesn’t do much justice to anyone. Even the film’s technical elements are a step down from the previous installments. Abrams never steadies his framing or compositions. I felt as though my eyes were needlessly unfocused, not directed toward any action in particular. Worse yet, the action lacks energy. These might be the worst shot lightsaber fights in the history of Star Wars. Abrams, to his detriment, too often relies on close-ups making every shot want for space. That is, while we hear the impact of the plasma blades, we often miss the swing. A critical error in an all-too safe movie that doesn’t take nearly enough swings.  A fine review for a travesty of a movie. Well said. My hope is that Jar Jar Abrams takes the money and walks off into the sunset never to return. I am so bummed with this movie. You are clueless and taking uneducated jabs at a franchise you must not know very well. Even if you didn’t like the story, acting, or diversity the visuals and action choreography were top notch. You review is sub par and deserves to be in the trash heap. Wow did you even watch the movie or are you just an idiot? Geez you critics are the most annoying things on this planet. You can’t enjoy a movie and have to criticize every little thing. News flash you aren’t a true star wars fan. Only true star wars fans enjoyed this movie. And saying this movie didn’t have heart um excuse me but did you even watch it? There was a lot of heart and a lot of beautiful moments. Was this movie perfect? No far from it but it was a good movie with plenty of exciting moments. You critics think you know everything but you don’t. Thank you to all my true star wars fans out there who enjoyed and appreciated this movie for what it is! Your review was asinine. I’m sure you’re not a bad person, or even a bad reviewer for that matter, but you completely missed the mark on this one….",NEGATIVE

For the most part, droids are hard-headed, sturdy companions, opening doors at the last minute with a minimum of beepy fuss. Director JJ Abrams is like a droid. He revived this brand from his childhood memories, unarchiving it from his data banks and dutifully projecting it, just like Artoo does with Leia’s hologram in the 1977 original. Abrams’s ‘The Force Awakens’ (2015) was a pitch-perfect summoning of old magic: thrilling and nostalgic, even if the trick remained stubbornly unimaginative. But Rian Johnson’s follow-up, ‘The Last Jedi’ (2017), executive-produced by Abrams, was something else entirely, subversive and churning with dark emotions. The franchise didn’t deserve it. Now Abrams the droid is back, scurrying around to clean up those untidy messes that made things interesting for a parsec. ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ marks the return of a plodding dullness, the kind that George Lucas peddled with his second trilogy, laden with pointless plot curlicues, witless imperial intrigue and boring heroism. It feels like a massive retrenchment – privately, a rebellion seems to have been fought and lost – and only the most loyal fans will be happy about it. Right from the start, you feel the soft reboot: ghostly zombie destroyers rise up out of a planet’s dirt, not quite vanquished. Will this new First Order prevail? Scarfaced Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) tear-asses around in his TIE fighter, less a sullenly rejected partner than back on his villainous business; Rey (Daisy Ridley, thirsty for dramatic opportunities that never materialise) continues her rock-levitation practice. The psychic connection between these two, tinged with destiny and even a hint of attraction, was a major invention from the last movie. Now that tension has been cooled to a low simmer, all the better to make room for a bunch of lackadaisical lightsaber duels. ‘The Rise of Skywalker’ seems tooled for an ‘Avengers’-bred audience accustomed to a string of trinket quests: where is the doodad that will lead to the dagger with the Sith writing that will steer us to the right galaxy while we avoid the quicksand and those flying stormtroopers? Even amid this disastrous script pile-up (co-written by ‘Justice League’ scribe Chris Terrio), the old charm can’t help but manifest on occasion: the Millennium Falcon was meant to shimmy through steel canyons, Oscar Isaac’s rakish Poe Dameron feels right as the attitudinal heir to Han Solo, and composer John Williams continues to do all the heavy lifting. But otherwise, how did things get slack so quickly? For every floppy-haired Wookiee appearance (a balm to the soul), there are five missed opportunities. Billy Dee Williams wanders in and no one knows what to do with his Big Lando Energy. Shouldn’t it be a crime to cast Keri Russell from ‘The Americans’ as a facially hidden master hacker? And do you remember Kelly Marie Tran’s heroic mechanic, Rose? Abrams really hopes you don’t – she’s been downgraded to a generic helper lady while John Boyega’s Finn goes gallivanting with another love interest, a sad capitulation to dark-web racism. Even the new droid underwhelms: Dio, a puppylike conehead, says things like ‘Sad’ and ‘Happy’. With the fates of Skywalkers rising or falling, pardon us if we expect grander.

"Dec 18, 2019"," As assured, calculated and predictable as a railroad timetable, “Star Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker” brings the trilogy of trilogies into the station with precision, hitting moments of grandeur and betrayal with brutal efficacy in a galaxy far, far away. For many audiences — “Star Wars” devotees and dilettantes alike — director J.J. Abrams’ singular devotion to delivering unto them exactly what they came for will be enough. Alliances are forged and betrayed, planets are destroyed and destinies are fulfilled, all set to the irresistible sweep of John Williams’ legendary score. But like the saga’s many acolytes who struggle to meet the expectations of their teachers, Abrams never quite manages the alchemy of his own mentor, maestro of manipulation Steven Spielberg. In Spielberg’s best work, even when we know exactly what’s coming, or when we in the audience know we’re being played, there’s still a delight in having our buttons pushed so masterfully. Abrams certainly knows how to manipulate, but when he does it, you can see the strings. How much or little you enjoy “The Rise of Skywalker” will rely almost entirely on whether or not you mind that every laugh and tear and jolt feels like it’s coming right off a spreadsheet. It has become forbidden for reviews to discuss the plot of films like this in any detail, so suffice it to say that an ancient evil resurfaces, forcing rebel leaders Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) to do a lot of going to The Place to get The Thing so they can fight The Guy. Along the way, Rey will continue to grapple with Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the guy she literally can’t get out of her head. Fans will be relieved to know that there’s no new Death Star this time around, but Rey is still seeking her place in the universe, even as she’s pulled toward both the light and the dark, much in the same way as her father figure Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) was in the middle trilogy. And since the ninth chapter of a nine-chapter story isn’t unlike the series finale of a TV show, many of the franchise’s venerable players pop up for one last goodbye before they head over to the cast party. The screenplay also undoes what was, for me, one of the best ideas of “The Last Jedi,” in what would appear to be a pandering piece of fan service — although in this movie, it’s hardly alone in that regard. “The Rise of Skywalker” is, without a doubt, a well-oiled machine, zipping us from deserts to cliffs to the most wave-tossed ocean you’ve ever seen without a single green-screen seam showing. I don’t want to know how much or how little of the late Carrie Fisher’s appearance as General Leia Organa was actually filmed by the actress – I assume it’s mostly post-production wizardry – but the character manages to remain just outside of the uncanny valley. It’s probably more an indication of the script than of the talented players that two of the movie’s most moving moments belong to Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels). Rest assured that there’s nothing in this final “Star Wars” that would prompt the eye-rolls or the snickers of Episodes I-III; Abrams is too savvy a studio player for those kinds of shenanigans. But his slick delivery of a sterling, shiny example of what Martin Scorsese would call “not cinema” feels momentarily satisfying but ultimately unfulfilling. It’s a somewhat soulless delivery system of catharsis, but Disney and Abrams are banking on the delivery itself to be enough.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","  “I’m doing what you did,” says Rey (Daisy Ridley). Who’s she talking to? Does it matter? In Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, newer characters go through old familiar motions, and so do old familiar characters, who won’t die even when they’re dead. Director J.J. Abrams imitates anything from the original trilogy he didn’t already xerox into 2015’s The Force Awakens. Did you see Return of the Jedi‘s second Death Star in the trailer? If you think that’s the only superweapon in this movie, then Abrams has a thousand bridges in Brooklyn to sell you.
  “The dead speak!” proclaims the opening crawl. The voice of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is mysteriously broadcasting across the galaxy. The Emperor expired long ago, so it would be just stupid to assume he is still alive. But what uninspired hack could be resurrecting his image, and to what purpose?
  It’s a surprisingly meta concept, since General Leia is still quite prominent. She’s played by Carrie Fisher, despite the performer’s untimely death long before production started. I don’t really know how Fisher’s appearance was created. It looks like a very high-tech combination of unused footage, digital effects, and terrible writing. Her presence plus the Emperor’s shadowy appearance multiplied by other ghosts from the past equals yet another Disney-branded Star Wars looking ever backward, never forward.
  The nostalgia festival proves one final kneecap-slice for the heroes of this sequel trilogy. Rey still suffers from a nasty case of flashbackitis, always almost remembering her parents. Her mysterious past is her entire arc now, and Ridley has to spend another adventure staring with pensive urgency, dutifully waiting to find out what character she’s playing.
  Along with her friends Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac), Rey’s stuck in one of those fetch-quest plots you tend to get from later Pirates of the Caribbeans. Our heroes need to [deep breath] find a green glowing rock on one planet, and the location of that rock is etched onto a special dagger on another planet, but the coordinates are written in a language that can only be translated on another planet.
  Keri Russell appears, briefly and awesomely, as a behelmeted old friend. Naomie Ackie plays a new ally who explains her backstory in her only extended dialogue scene, before blastjumping ensues. Isaac gives Poe a new pranksterish edge, which is fun. Finn keeps yelling Rey’s name loudly, which isn’t.
  The best thing I can say about Rise of Skywalker is that it is sometimes incoherent on purpose. The Millennium Falcon escapes TIE Fighters by “lightspeed skipping” between locations in short bursts: hyperspace, crazy planet with tentacles, hyperspace, asteroid field, hyperspace, etc.
  It’s an offense to whatever spatial reality George Lucas demanded from fighter jets screaming in outer space, and a few scenes in Skywalker represent chaos cinema unbounded from all logic. Rey still sees Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) in galaxy-crossed tele-conversations, a contrivance that develops goofy new dimensions. Sacrifices get un-sacrificed, and superpowers become super-DUPER-powers. In a sacred moment of apex silliness, Resistance fighters ride starbeasts of burden across the surface of a low-flying Star Destroyer. If I understand gravity correctly, the evil pilots could defeat the rebel cavalry by just slightly dipping the ship’s port side.
  Abrams co-wrote the screenplay with Chris Terrio, who also worked on on Batman v Superman and Justice League, poor guy. Those smash-ups had their own weird fixation on resurrecting dead flesh, but you have to credit Abrams for Rise of Skywalker’s top-speed pointlessness. He’s always been an excessive filmmaker, and excess is all he has left for his second Star Wars: huge fleets, bigger stormtrooper squads, the most droid pals ever.
  Every character suffers, squeezed between action scenes and runscream hyper-emotionality. Kylo Ren’s turn toward counterculture anarchy was the best part of 2017’s The Last Jedi, and now this sequel rewinds him toward another internal Dark-Light thumbwar. I didn’t love Last Jedi, but it’s notable that director Rian Johnson was fascinated by Driver’s face, letting the idiosyncratic actor play simmering rage and melancholy. Abrams’ camera prefers Driver’s towering frame, shooting upward to emphasize his room-filling physicality. Rise of Skywalker ragdolls all its humans. Rey, Poe, and Finn keep crashing, tumbling, and jumping between ships. Just once, couldn’t someone in this sequel trilogy chill out?
  If you enjoyed The Last Jedi, you’ll be disappointed by the walkback qualities of this follow-up. Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran) gets demoted to screenstaring at the command center. (She can’t join the main adventure because she has to “study the specs of old Destroyers,” now come on.) Another key Last Jedi personality returns with their whole philosophy pointed in an opposite direction. Johnson was anxious about the franchise’s influence, and not shy about suggesting that it would be weird to inherit somebody else’s saga. Abrams is the franchise era incarnate, producing Star Treks and Mission: Impossibles when he isn’t Cloverfielding stray ideas into new spin-offs. Unsurprising, maybe, that his tale requires rigid focus on inheritance and legacy. “I will earn your brother’s saber,” Rey tells Leia, still obsessed with another man’s weapon.
  There is one exciting planetscape, where greatwall waves crash skyscraper-high. A couple rando stormtroopers jetpack skyward off speeder bikes. “They fly now?” asks Finn. “They fly now!” says Poe. It’s way cool; they never fly again. Unlike the graytech sci-fi of the other recent Star Wars entries, Rise of the Skywalker embraces the operatic possibilities of spaced-out fantasy: hidden planets, forbidden deserts, a dark pyramid. C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) has a moving speech that dissipates into plotstuff. One nefarious character announces the First Order’s intention to “harvest more of the galaxy’s young,” a rather reflexive sub-subplot for a Disney movie. Domhnall Gleeson is off in his own mad farce as officious snarlfart General Hux, who gets the best line in the film.

"Dec 18, 2019"," Director J.J. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio close the book on the core origin story of George Lucas' space saga as the torch of intergalactic control is passed from one generation to the next in 'Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.' How many film franchises have lasted for 42 years? Who will be surprised if Disney, the adoptive parent of George Lucas‘ remarkable baby, doesn’t keep siring new offspring for the seemingly inexhaustible intergalactic mother ship known as Star Wars for longer than anyone connected with the original series is still alive? Will movie theaters still exist when the children, biological or otherwise, of Rey or Poe or Finn are old enough to fly? Has the property now become too Disneyfied? Will even more of the core fan base that angrily turned on The Last Jedi continue and amplify their vendetta in the wake of the new entry? These are some of the questions swirling around Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, which eventfully, if not exactly satisfactorily, closes the book on the core origin story of this indelible world. On a popular level, it succeeds in a way that good escapist fiction always has, by transporting you completely to a fabulous foreign realm unvisitable by any other means. No one who has seen the preceding VIII chapters will dare miss this concluding installment, which means that the vast majority of the known moviegoing world will turn up. And in theaters, no less. But there are nagging problems that, while evident in the previous two entries, have become more pronounced now. With J.J. Abrams back at the helm after having efficiently relaunched the franchise four years ago with The Force Awakens, there was little doubt that the serious business of keeping Disney’s most valuable acquisition well-tended would be responsibly managed by the man who previously relaunched Star Trek on the big screen. If anything, the director has overcompensated, practically tripping over himself in a mad-dash effort to deliver the expected goods and then some. It’s easy to conjure up the image of him as a beleaguered chef in a large kitchen preparing a huge banquet, trying to satisfy lots of customers in the ways that count and not goof up anything too important. In the most obvious ways he has largely succeeded, even if the more-is-more approach ultimately leaves one both bloated from too many courses and uncertain about some of the ingredients. To switch metaphors, he’s also a traffic cop; there’s more travel here than in Around the World in 80 Days, and it sure moves a lot faster, but half the time you don’t know either where the characters are or why they’re going somewhere else, which is virtually all the time. The dramatic structure owes more to a pinball machine than to a logically planned trip, but this doesn’t matter all that much, as most viewers will just be on board for a great ride and more than willing to go wherever the film takes them. The core dynamic at play in the script by Chris Terrio (Argo, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Justice League) and Abrams, from a story by Derek Connolly (Safety Not Guaranteed, Jurassic World, Monster Trucks), is, appropriately enough given the franchise’s jump from Fox to Disney, the passing of the torch of intergalactic control from one generation to the next. Courtesy of a rather significant amount of previously unused footage, the late Carrie Fisher‘s Leia Organa is on hand to participate in the transfer of power. The sense of continuity is furthered by the liberation from self-imposed hermitude of Mark Hamill‘s Luke Skywalker and the big-screen re-emergence, after 34 years and numerous gigs as the character on TV and in video games, of Billy Dee Williams’ Lando Calrissian.  At the outset, the universe is at a point where domination by the First Order once again seems a possibility. You would think that the utter and repeated obliteration suffered by the dark side in the past would be enough for peace and quiet to prevail at least for a few lifetimes. But, no, somehow old Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is still hanging in there and a massive generation of young stormtroopers is at the ready to attack once heir presumptive Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) sheds his Hamlet-like indecision and decides to seize his opportunity to rule the world. The main thing giving him pause is his keen attraction to Rey (Daisy Ridley). Despite his predilection for wearing his own, red-veined version of a Darth Vader mask, for the longest time he remains hung up on a fantasy that he and Rey can become the ruling couple of the universe. But she’s no more prone to entertain this notion than she’s ever been, preferring to hone her skills as a badass warrior, a vocation furthered when Leia bestows her personal lightsaber on the intensely focused younger woman. For quite a long time, the film jumps all over the place, making as many stops as a local subway train. Rey and ace pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) remain at odds about most things, but the main demand on the latter’s time is jerry-rigging his rickety used spacecrafts and otherwise wrestling with physical jeopardy, which happens all the time as the small band of Resistance fighters fly hither and yon looking for the Emperor’s gathering forces. Never does a mechanical problem remain unsolved by Poe for more than a minute or two. So agreeable are most of the performers and so busy are the characters tending to urgent matters that the why and wherefore of what’s happening onscreen becomes increasingly obscure: Where does everyone stand in relation to one another? Where is so-and-so going and why? What’s at stake in this particular confrontation? (Of course, there has to be at least a mini-crisis every few minutes.) Not everything can represent the same urgent importance, nor should the fate of the universe be at stake every 10 minutes. Yes, it was so in 1930s serials like Flash Gordon, which is what inspired Lucas to create Star Wars in the first place, and very occasionally, such as in Raiders of the Lost Ark, a modern director has been able to pull off a highly episodic adventure like this.  Here, though, the massive jumble of standoffs, near-misses, tense confrontations, narrow escapes and slick victories, while momentarily exciting, can lack plausible motivation and credibility. More often than not, one wonders not so much what just happened but why, and what was at stake. A plot like this, featuring so many characters, locations and story dynamics, can by nature be confusing; so relentless is the pileup of incident that, at a certain point, one can be excused for checking out on the particulars of what’s going on at a given moment and why in favor of just going along for the amusement park ride. There are directors who are content with such ambitions, just as there are large audiences for same. Abrams has a foot in one camp and the other foot in another, hoping to have it both ways, which he manages for the reason that The Rise of Skywalker has a good sense of forward movement that keeps the pic, and the viewer, keyed up for well over two hours. It might not be easy to confidently say what’s actually going on at any given moment and why, but the filmmakers’ practiced hands, along with the deep investment on the part of fans, will likely keep the majority of viewers happily on board despite the checkered nature of the storytelling. Still, an increasingly vexing issue that serves to hold one’s enthusiasm in check are the main characters and cast of episodes VII to IX. The simultaneous onscreen presence here of Fisher, Hamill, Williams and a fun, unbilled appearance by another franchise favorite creates a wave of sentimental affection and goodwill that the younger leads have never generated across three films. Isaac has loosened up a bit to become more engaging as the series has progressed, but the same can’t be said for Ridley, whose portrait of Rey runs the gamut between determined and grim. As Kylo Ren, Driver is, for the most part, broodingly recessive in a not particularly intriguing way; his character an uninterestingly conflicted, not to mention inarticulate, Hamlet. It almost goes without saying that, from a physical production point of view, The Rise of Skywalker is stupendous, enough reason by itself to see and even enjoy the film. Clearly no expense has been spared in making almost every scene spectacular, and cinematographer Dan Mindel has here surpassed his work on The Force Awakens and numerous other special effects extravaganzas with his often striking images (some eye-popping settings, particularly in Jordan and along a stormy seacoast that makes the one in Ryan’s Daughter look like a wading pool, don’t hurt). Production designers Rick Carter and Kevin Jenkins and costume designer Michael Kaplan aced their jobs as well, as have, in spades, the visual and special effects teams. John Williams, 87 years young, has composed yet another rambunctious, melodious, propulsive score for a very big film; you wouldn’t want anyone else on the job. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," There’s an old parlor game called Consequences. In its most advanced form, you write a paragraph on a sheet of paper, fold the paper over leaving the last line exposed, and then the next person has to pick up the story without full knowledge of what you were aiming for. Hilarious, disjointed stories result, with the occasional flash of serendipity.  With the release of its final episode, The Rise of Skywalker this Friday, the entire Star Wars sequel trilogy is about to reveal itself as a multibillion-dollar game of Consequences. Director J.J. Abrams’ first paragraph was The Force Awakens (2015), in which he and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan played it fast and loose with their homage. They wanted only characters and scenes that would ""surprise and delight"" themselves as Star Wars fans first and foremost. Clearly, Abrams wants that again here.  In between the Abrams paragraphs, the page was handed to Rian Johnson, whose impish choices in The Last Jedi (2017), took the story in another direction, creating the most deft and painful portrayal of what happens when heroes fail since The Empire Strikes Back. The sharp turn was praised by critics hungry for edgier storytelling, and won over a clear majority of audiences. But it also helped create one of the noisiest cultural divides in a decade: Even two years later, The Last Jedi Wars, between pro- and anti- forces, rage on every social media platform.  The Consequences game is ""the right metaphor"" for what happened when the page was handed back to J.J. Abrams for the final episode (after a few false starts with players ejected from the game). That's what co-writer Chris Terrio conceded to me before I saw The Rise of Skywalker.  ""We started by asking ‘What do we want to emotionally experience as an audience in our last 2 hours 15 minutes of Star Wars?'” Terrio said. ""Then we’d play this narrative game: What is the last place in the galaxy each of these characters would want to go?"" If you treat The Rise of Skywalker as an exciting visual experience first and foremost, and think of its plot simply as the last paragraph in a narrative game, you will have a fine time. This movie is an explosive, action-packed visual feast that starts in the thick of things and doesn't let go. Don't overthink it.  But who am I kidding? Millions of Star Wars fans overthink just about everything, myself included. So if you have spent the last four years combing over every detail of the sequel trilogy story, and you expect answers and a perfectly polished plot with neat bows everywhere ... well, then your reaction is likely more of a crapshoot.  You may get the answers you wanted and like it; you may get the answers you wanted and not like it, sensing a whiff of condescension in Abrams' crowd-pleasing approach. Some 'shippers will be frustrated as hell; others happy as clams.  Particularly obsessive fans may expect to spend days or weeks in a white-hot rage over one controversial storytelling decision in particular. Just as in a real game of Consequences, some of the aspects of this final paragraph feel like they came out of nowhere.  And as was the case with some of the head-scratching twists and turns of the prequel trilogy, it will be up to the other forms of Star Wars media — books and comics, mostly — to paper over the cracks. Part of Lucasfilm's job now is to make the whole narrative game seem more pre-ordained than it actually was.  Abrams and Terrio seem to have been operating in full awareness of this plot safety net. And so they race through a dizzying number of visual and emotional beats at breakneck speed, barely fleshing any of them out. There are just a shade too many characters overall, and the most well-drawn, compelling ones, ironically, are the ones newly introduced in this film.  The Rise of Skywalker does remember to slow down every so often to let us and the characters take a well-earned break, but such breathers are fewer and further between than in any Star Wars movies past. I had a recurring sense that I was involuntarily watching the movie the way I listen to podcasts: on 1.25x speed.  To be fair to Abrams and Terrio, they were handed an almost impossible assignment. Popular epic tales are notoriously hard to bring in for a smooth landing, especially on deadline: Just ask George R.R. Martin. By focusing on emotional experiences first, and leaving a few of the big questions open, Abrams is allowing us to end the trilogy (and the trilogy of trilogies) in our own way, with a sprinkling of headcanon.  In this the director is following a path well trodden by his idol, George Lucas. Both directors know the importance of the mystery box. And we can at least be glad that Abrams has not indulged his worst mystery box tendencies, the ones he is famous for. We're lucky we got anything answered at all. He's a people pleaser who is allergic to controversy, and he can let it override his instincts. (Take the lens flare thing, which he has never done since we started poking fun.) He wants to have things both ways; he wants to straddle a giant cultural divide. He's a centrist in an age of extremes.  Which is great when you're talking about 90 percent of what Star Wars is, in its DNA: simple accessible fun, the first great global myth. But George Lucas took risks, didn't care about being liked, and liked to switch things up, hence the prequels. Abrams not only shies away from the full consequences of his own bold moves — both in The Force Awakens and here — he seems to feel the need to kick some dust over the bold moves of others. This is not always a movie in the best ""yes, and"" spirit of improv.  This is a necessarily vague statement, of course. Suffice to say that Abrams has been playing Consequences, writing that last paragraph of the experimental story, in a very performative way. He's aware of the audience in every move of the pen, it seems, in much the same way that the later Game of Thrones seasons seemed suddenly hyper-aware of its global audience.  Time will tell whether Abrams has succeeded in uniting the fandom again with his last lines — or whether, in trying to unite it, he has managed to please neither side of the great divide.

"Dec 18, 2019"," ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" leans heavily on nostalgia, has at least two big surprises, and needs a second watch to digest and unpack everything going on in the two-hour-and-20-minute film. Long thought dead, the ninth film in the saga tosses Emperor Palpatine, the antagonist of the first two trilogies, back into the mix. As Kylo Ren (played by Adam Driver) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) seek out the Sith leader for very different reasons — the former for answers and fulfillment and the latter to destroy him — the two are, once again, pit against one another in a battle for their souls. Will Rey succumb to the dark side? Will Kylo Ren receive redemption? And, for the last time, who is Rey? ""TROS"" gives answers to each question while frustratingly creating others that linger.  Much like 2015's ""The Force Awakens,"" ""TROS"" delivers a lot of fan service with many beats of the original trilogy. That may be enough for some. By its conclusion, people will either leave satisfied or wondering what creator George Lucas originally envisioned for his sequel trilogy.  ""The Force Awakens"" director J.J. Abrams returns to bring the new trilogy to a close after Colin Trevorrow (""Jurassic World"") parted ways with Lucasfilm as director. ""TROS"" closes out the final film in the George Lucas Skywalker saga which followed young Anakin Skywalker's descent to the dark side and his eventual redemption thanks to his son, Luke. In 2015, Disney revived the series with Anakin's conflicted grandson, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren.  The main cast of Driver, Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher return. Keri Russell, Billy Dee Williams, Dominic Monaghan, and Naomie Ackie join the ninth film. In a recent New York Times interview, Abrams said while he believed Rian Johnson's eighth film made ""bold"" choices, he thought it was ""a bit of a meta approach,"" saying he didn't think fans went to ""Star Wars"" to be told things don't matter. In another interview, he told the Associated Press his finale isn't an apology for the previous film, but specific scenes in ""TROS"" appear to say the opposite, smoothing over and explaining away some rough edges in the eighth film involving Snoke, Luke Skywalker, and Rey. For instance, if you were upset that Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker seemed out of character as a grumpy hermit, that's fixed here. His character seemingly does a 180 as a Force ghost. While that may please some fans, it will undoubtedly disappoint anyone who wished to see more of a positive, hopeful Luke in Johnson's film. After waiting four long years, fans will receive an answer about Rey's lineage. Abrams doesn't completely wipe out and disregard what Kylo Ren said about Rey's parents in the last film, but he does give viewers a definitive answer — and one that may very well divide the fandom. One of the film's best changes is our heroes aren't separated on completely different missions, a unity that was a staple in the original trilogy. Expect to see plenty of Poe Dameron, Finn, Chewbacca, and Rey together. Frankly, it was silly that Poe and Rey haven't had a real introduction until this film. C-3PO is utilized here for more than throwaway lines. In the film's first 30 minutes, he may have more dialogue than in ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi"" combined.  Once again, it's the mysterious connection between Rey and Ben Solo that's a major draw in ""TROS."" A few lightsaber fights between the two are big highlights of the ninth film. Fans will appreciate that Abrams found a respectful and important way to incorporate Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia into the movie. Others will enjoy how the film explores and references ideas brought up by Emperor Palpatine in ""Revenge of the Sith."" A lot of ""TROS"" feels like it rehashes storylines in ""Revenge of the Sith"" and ""Return of the Jedi,"" sometimes beat for beat. Some will feel the saga plays it too safe by tapping into that nostalgia, but Lucas has always considered ""Star Wars"" as poetry, saying the films ""rhyme."" It would be odd if the last film wasn't referential of that. In ditching and undoing some of ""TLJ,"" it makes the new trilogy feel like less of a connected series and more like three separate films cobbled together. More or less, that's exactly what this trilogy has been. After the release of ""TLJ,"" Simon Pegg said Abrams had a different idea for Rey's lineage (perhaps the one finally revealed here). After Trevorrow left ""Episode IX,"" he said he wasn't considering bringing back Palpatine. Lucas' first two trilogies follow definitive archs. The prequel trilogy introduces us to Anakin and shows his journey to the dark side as Vader. The second trilogy introduces us to Luke, the hope to bring balance to the Force who stops the Emperor's reign of terror. It never felt like there was one overarching idea for this trilogy. In a way, it has arguably been less about the Skywalker saga than it has been about Rey's journey to discover her place in the world. It felt like each director came in and worked on their own individual film separately. It's enough to make a fan wonder what Lucas' original treatments for this trilogy entailed, even if it had something to do with the Midi-chlorians. Disney chose not to use them. Unlike the first six films, Disney's trilogy has been more concerned with creating mysteries, adding clever nods to the franchise to distract and appease fans, and introducing new characters (Rose, droid D-O, Zorii Bliss, and Jannah) than it ever has time to fully explore. We're also introduced to more uses of the Force in this movie. Some of them will undoubtedly spark conversation and raise eyebrows. Honestly, after rewatching the first eight films and seeing some other exaggerated Force powers, I'm fine with letting it go and embracing whatever Abrams tells me is a Force power. ""The Mandalorian"" hinted at one power in particular. If you're hoping to get some big sweeping statement about the future of the Jedi religion or whether balance was actually brought to the Force, you get a somewhat vague explanation and conclusion, which I can only assume is because Lucasfilm and Disney want to leave the world open to explore other avenues in future ""Star Wars"" films that have already been announced.  Two years ago, I thought fans would love ""The Last Jedi,"" and was surprised that wasn't the case. If you loved ""TFA"" then you should enjoy ""Episode IX,"" though I don't think you'll love it as much. Conversely, if you enjoyed Rian Johnson's take on ""Star Wars,"" you may not enjoy the final chapter. Regardless, if you've been on this journey for years, you're going to come along for the ride to see how the Skywalker saga concludes. You don't spend more than 40 years with a franchise and just let it go. One final note: Avoid the trailers if you can. Many of the film's biggest moments have been overly teased in trailers and I wish many of them were left as surprises, including the scene with all of the ships gathering in space.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Some 42 years in the making, the Star Wars saga is finally at an end. Episode IX, The Rise of Skywalker, sees the return of some old friends – not least J.J. Abrams, back as director – and some old foes. The Resistance has learned that the Emperor is amassing a new army on a hidden planet not present on any star maps, and so Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) set out to find and destroy him. What follows is a high-speed romp through the galaxy, as our heroes look to outwit Ren and the evil leaders of the First Order. Early on, they’re reunited with the roguish Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), last seen downing the second Death Star. As glimpsed in the trailer, the wreck of that battle station has a part to play in The Rise of Skywalker; indeed, given the Herculean task Abrams has in wrapping up the series, he and co-writer Chris Terrio draw strength from the Star Wars universe wherever possible, aided by a chorus of past voices. Continuing the themes of sacrifice and sins of the father, Rey’s search for her own origins takes centre stage. Rest assured, you won’t be disappointed. Among the newcomers, Richard E. Grant is fabulous as the First Order’s General Pryde, but it’s the original stars that really make this finale. The late Carrie Fisher’s appearance as Leia (via unused footage from Abrams’ earlier Star Wars effort, The Force Awakens ) is tinged with sadness. Likewise Mark Hamill’s return as Luke Skywalker, the farm boy who found his inner Jedi Knight. By the end, as the twin suns set on cinema’s greatest ever sci-fi series, it’s near-impossible to hold back the tears.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","The cast does a very good job, but this trilogy is stuck in a nose dive it can't escape. The movie tries to use fan service to save the day, but it just comes off as desperate...",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," As one of the greatest sagas in cinema history reaches its climax, it’s concerning that Star Wars has lately been generating more drama off screen than on. There’s been the personnel changes (original director Colin Trevorrow left after “creative differences”, prompting the return of JJ Abrams). Then there was the fact that this instalment’s predecessor, Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, took the story to surprising new places and left a lot of questions unanswered. Some fans were left confused; a nastier contingent railed against its so-called “identity politics”. Even some of the actors have admitted their doubts about The Last Jedi – John Boyega recently described it as “feeling a bit iffy”. Add in the fact that this instalment has to cap off a 42-year trilogy of trilogies, and that Baby Yoda from spin-off series The Mandalorian has outshone any character in the movies in terms of public affection, and this has more work to do than it ought to. Given that there is no possible way of pleasing all the people even half the time when it comes to Star Wars, the good news is, The Rise of Skywalker is the send-off the saga deserves. The bad news is, it is largely the send-off we expected. Of course there is epic action to savour and surprises and spoilers to spill, but given the long, long build-up, some of the saga’s big revelations and developments might be a little unsatisfying on reflection. We’re given little time to think about that though: the story gets moving quickly and barely pauses for breath. The Resistance gang is all brought together swiftly, including a cut-and-pasted Carrie Fisher, and in short measure they’re off in the Millennium Falcon on a kind of galaxy-trotting treasure-hunt, told in quick, efficient strokes. The central characters – Daisy Ridley’s Rey, Oscar Isaac’s Poe, John Boyega’s Finn, and good old Chewbacca (who gets a bit more to do this time), establish an easy, seriocomic camaraderie that makes you wish they’d spent more time together on screen. Their whistle-stop tour is fleshed out with action set-pieces, new characters and locations, and plenty of attractive visual detail in the margins. There’s so much plotting and exposition, it feels like two movies condensed into one at times, and there is little downtime in which to really get into any character depth but Abrams’ knack for efficient storytelling and the odd visual flourish carries it along, at least to the half-way point. As for the Dark Side, it is no secret that Ian McDiarmid’s old-school Sith lord Emperor Palpatine is back in the frame, along with Adam Driver’s conflicted Kylo Ren, whose cracked mask hints all too obviously at his bruised inner turmoil. But then Rey has her issues too. She is kind to abused droids and injured snake monsters, but there are question marks over her morality too, as hinted at at in the trailer’s much-discussed inclusion of a “dark Rey”. Ren and Rey’s mysterious connection has been the most intriguing aspect of the new trilogy. Here, it unfolds in a series of teases and false starts that almost border on wearisome, though there are hints of ambiguity and even eroticism to it. Let’s just hope they don’t turn out to be brother and sister this time. As with the original Star Wars trilogy, there is just enough in this dynamic to muddy up the simplistic good-versus-evil themes, although this latest trilogy has been as much about hope versus fear, which is where it could possibly strike a contemporary chord. The big questions get answered, but cannot be discussed further, for the time being. Let’s just say some old Star Wars traditions die hard. As do old Star Wars characters. There are so many returning old faces in this movie, you start to wonder if anyone ever actually dies and stays dead in this far-away galaxy. But if you’re going to do a send-off this huge, there are a lot of goodbyes to say, and a lot of loose ends to tie up. The fact that The Rise of Skywalker manages most of them and within a vaguely coherent story is something of an achievement in itself. This vast, hulking Star Destroyer of a franchise has become too cumbersome to pull off any genuinely nimble manoeuvres, but at the same time, it never falls out of the sky. Partly that’s a simple matter of momentum, but it is also a question of faith. Over its long history, Star Wars has acquired a mythic grandeur few movie franchises can ever hope to match.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is the most convoluted of all the Star Wars movies. It feels like three full movies worth of plot crammed into one film. The stories in the other Star Wars movies, even the Prequels, have a way of bringing a viewer into that world. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker never lets us in. It, instead, keeps us at arms length so it can use almost its entire first half as exposition. Just character after character explaining things. Well, other than how the Emperor is back. (Don’t worry, I couldn’t spoil that if I tried.) When the movie opens, he’s already back. As the title crawl reveals, Palpatine has been sending messages across the galaxy and now there’s a race to find him. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, who inexplicably wears a helmet again for half this movie; because when you hire an actor of Driver’s talent, he should for sure wear a mask) thinks of Palpatine as a threat to his power. Our heroes in the Resistance — Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), and Poe (Oscar Issac) — think of Palpatine as the ultimate threat to the galaxy. Unfortunately, this turns Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker into any other typical action movie where it’s just characters searching for multiple items that can lead to another item that can lead to the actual thing they want. Here, it’s something called the wayfinder, which shows the way to Palpatine. And there are two of them. But to find the wayfinder, they first need to find a sacred Sith dagger that explains where the wayfinder is. There are so many new trinkets that everyone needs I started to lose count. Now, if you’re thinking, wow, that last paragraph was over explanatory, that’s what the first hour of The Rise of Skywalker is like. Just explaining what all these items are and what they need to do to get them. And why this item we’ve never heard of before is now the most important thing ever. It’s just a weird thing, in the final movie of this whole saga, to be introducing so much new plot that has to be explained over and over.  A lot of my favorite moments over the course of these films are just quieter moments, with these characters spending time with each other just … talking. It’s why we care about them in the first place. It’s how we know Han really cares about Luke. It’s how we know Finn cares about Rey. But in this chapter, we don’t get that. It’s almost remarkable how this type of scene wasn’t included. Instead, we are just chasing after wayfinders and magic daggers. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker eventually hits a better stride. The second half offers some legitimately fun and emotional moments — seeing Billy Dee William’s Lando again is a treat; and Abrams and company really did the best they could have done handling Carrie Fisher’s scenes — before kind of going off the rails again at the end (obviously I can’t get into these details now but, yes, I have a lot more to say about all this after its release).  The biggest bummer is how it deals with the events of The Last Jedi. Look, that’s a movie I love, but I understand some of the valid criticism of it. But instead of The Rise of Skywalker building on top of that, it just feels like there was an active plan to wipe that movie out. (Again, unfortunately, I can’t get into specifics yet.) Which, hey, I get if you don’t like The Last Jedi, you might think that’s a good thing. But so much time and effort are spent explaining a lot of it away, it just all feels clumsy. There were times it felt like The Rise of Skywalker was put together by reading angry reddit boards, just throwing in anything a fan might possibly want to see. It really is baffling. So, here we are, at the end of this Sequel trilogy. Three movies that exposed the tug-of-war, back and forth between two talented people on opposite ends of the spectrum. Yes, Rey and Kylo Ren. But, more importantly, J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson. For whatever reason, their two visions just don’t work side by side. Abrams gave us a great first movie that brought a lot of people back to Star Wars. Johnson gave us a second film that dared us to question what it was about Star Wars we believed in anyway. And now The Rise of Skywalker feels like a movie trying to steer against the skid instead of into it. And as a result, there was no way to avoid the crash.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," If there’s something you always wanted to see in a Star Wars movie, but haven’t yet, odds are it’s in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The film plays like a 150-minute checklist of cool stuff and surprises designed to please as many fans as possible. That may sound great, but in the process, that densely packed highlight reel fails to tell a story that’s narratively interesting, thematically cohesive, or that builds any impactful stakes. It’s a film designed to tantalize and delight in the hope those things cover up its many shortcomings. (Note: We’ll be largely spoiler-free from here on out but there will be some discussion of broad plot generalizations that some may consider minor spoilers. Read at your own risk.) When last we left a galaxy far, far away, the First Order had landed a decisive blow against the dwindling Resistance. However, a heroic act by Jedi Master Luke Skywalker was set to inspire the rest of the galaxy to rise up and help the small group of good people defeat the huge collection of bad people in the galaxy. Sadly, in The Rise of Skywalker, that thread is all but forgotten and not much has changed. The Resistance seems a little bigger, sure, but it’s still incredibly small—and now, instead of just the First Order to worry about, they have a new problem, too: Emperor Palpatine. Hopefully, thanks to the trailers, you know that  Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), the Sith Lord at the center of the previous two trilogies, is back. I say “hopefully” because the movie largely glosses over how he actually comes back. He just...is. By bypassing a logical explanation (there is one but it’s ill-conceived, to say the least), co-writer and director J.J. Abrams completely shifts the entire crux of the sequel trilogy thus far. The grand idea of the First Order never quite recovers from Palpatine’s introduction and all of their massive power developed over the previous two films is sorely undercut.  Finding the resurrected Sith Lord is no easy task either, and that is the main through line in The Rise of Skywalker. Rey (Daisy Ridley), Finn (John Boyega), Poe (Oscar Isaac), Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) set off on a quest across the galaxy to acquire clues to find where Palpatine is lurking so that they can destroy him. They’re also given an arbitrary timeline of a few days which is supposed to add tension to the proceedings but doesn’t, mainly because the passage of time in Star Wars has rarely been a big thing, so why start now? (Does anyone wear watches? Which sun do they go by?) With a group of characters looking for random objects that will provide a map to a legacy character, we’re back to The Force Awakens narrative structure again. That journey takes the crew to several new planets, all of which are bustling with life, aliens, droids, and all sorts of awesome Star Wars background material. Each time the heroes arrive on a planet, something exciting happens—we meet a new character, there’s a battle, a mystery is uncovered, etc. But the repetition is incessant. They’re on one planet, then another. Now a ship. Now a speeder. Now Rey’s off. Now Rey’s back. Now someone is in peril. Now they’re OK. The film moves at a breakneck speed and, as a result, never spends enough time at any of these places or with any of the people. It’s all incredibly rushed and mind-bogglingly cluttered. You almost feel like two movies’ worth of story are forced in, pun intended.  The few moments when The Rise of Skywalker does slow down, it improves immensely. For instance: its attempts to give Leia an important role in the story even with the limitations of Carrie Fisher’s passing, or to add weight to the crucial arc of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). In the case of Leia, Abrams does a more than sufficient job of weaving her character throughout. It’s probably a smaller role than she would have played if she were still alive, but the effects and editing make it so you hardly notice. Leia is the backbone of the film. As for her son, Kylo’s role is even more fascinating and complex than it was in the last two films. However, slotted into this dense, rushed story, it’s not given the time it needs to be explained properly and ultimately falls a little flat. Getting into more detail about either of those things requires talking heavy spoilers, so we’ll leave it there for now. Rey is once again the center of the movie, and she’s once again maybe its best part. The character has to endure a lot here—physically, mentally, spiritually—but Daisy Ridley continues to make it look all too easy. Close-ups of her reactions to some of the film’s bigger moments are heartbreakingly beautiful and a reminder of what Star Wars can be at its best. Some of her moments are so beautiful, in fact, that the tears in your eyes may make you forget the bumpy ride it took to get there. Driver and Ridley are excellent together every time they’re on screen. However, they’re on screen together so much in this one that at a certain point their lightsaber battling almost sputters off, as if they don’t know why they are even doing it anymore—like the movie has exhausted the idea of these two going toe-to-toe again and again. That awkward pause does lead to a new angle, though, so it’s not a total waste, but the pair certainly could have used an extra conversation or two to pad some of their narrative beats. Other returning characters, like Poe and Finn, also get more to do. There’s lots of fun banter, a few hints at their respective pasts, and maybe even the seeds of romance (not between the two, of course, but with other characters), Chewbacca has an expanded role, C-3PO plays a crucial part, and Lando’s (Billy Dee Williams) return is super nostalgic. One character who doesn’t get a lot more to do is Rose Tico (Kelly Marie Tran), who is mostly watching from the sidelines, wasting much of the potential she built up in the previous film. The film also manages to introduce lots of new characters too. Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell) and Jannah (Naomi Ackie) are both welcome, excellent additions and deserve way, way more screen time than they get. The same can be said for the super cute Babu Frik, who all but steals the movie, and new droid D-O, who is there only to cover a specific plot point but is adorable nonetheless. The main issue with The Rise of Skywalker is the movie tries to do too much with too many characters. All of these moments and introductions go by in a flash and feel short-changed in retrospect. The film is so jam-packed and dead set on moving on to the next item on the list that just when you want to see more of something or someone, it’s long gone. That happens with the plot too. Characters spend an hour solving one mystery only for it to open another mystery that’s basically the same exact thing, meaning neither of them truly feels important to the story at hand, let alone the entire Star Wars saga. All of that drains the stakes of the movie. Don’t forget this is Episode IX—the finale of not just one trilogy but a trilogy of trilogies, and the film tells us time and time again this is the battle to end all battles. The fate of the galaxy is on the line. But Abrams doesn’t quite convey this in an impactful, emotional way, nor in a way that one-ups similar conflicts seen in previous Star Wars finales. (It looks bigger for sure, but that’s about it.) Since we don’t quite understand the dynamic between the First Order and the Emperor, or the Emperor’s story, we’re just left trusting that this is a big deal. The movie is more concerned with finding its MacGuffins than creating tension. And the scenes meant to inspire that tension—such the reveal of a legion of Star Destroyers and what they can do—leave too many lingering questions. Where did that come from? How did it do that? You’re left scratching your head rather than being scared or worried about our heroes. Plus, time and time again, something major happens only to be reversed like it never happened a little while later. Very few things feel permanent in the film, which can work against the audience’s trust. And yet, this is Star Wars. Even if the story is wonky and its thematic drive unclear, every few minutes something happens that is fairly incredible. After all, there is that checklist of cool Star Wars things I mentioned earlier. And that avalanche of excess very expertly covers the fact that some of the character arcs don’t track or the story is repetitive. As long as we get huge reveals, shocking surprises, and lots of John Williams score playing over it, there’s a good chance you’ll be entertained, even if the movie really isn’t saying anything that we can take away and apply to our world. Star Wars is at its best when it’s inspiring, but The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t quite get that. It’s a means to an end destined to be divisive. Without a doubt, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker has something for everyone. It force-feeds you so much Star Wars you’ll probably want to go back for seconds. Sadly, it suffers mightily from being more focused on excess instead of resonance. For some people, that will be more than enough—but for us, it’s not. The Rise of Skywalker may be the end of this Star Wars trilogy, but there will be more in this universe eventually. The legacy of this film, and this trilogy, will not be an ending. Instead, it’s the beginning of a Star Wars debate that will last forever.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," “The dead speak!” exclaims the opening crawl of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker—the latest and final episode of the nine-part “Skywalker saga”—and the phrase possesses eerie significance. As the preeminent cinematic franchise of the last four decades, Stars Wars has become increasingly obsessed with resurrection in both purpose and content, keeping alive its legacy and box office dominance by endlessly referencing and recycling its past. But you can’t leech off the dead without deadening yourself. From its first to last frame, The Rise of Skywalker rages against the dying of the cultural spotlight: In a strained, desperate effort to restore relevance after franchise over-saturation and disappointment, J.J. Abrams’s film spectacle exhausts itself so thoroughly that the entire enterprise becomes moribund. In order to win back fans alienated by Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi, Abrams immediately turns to familiar faces and situations. But it’s a strategy that causes the film, like The Force Awakens before it, to feel like a retreat, given how it recycles the same narrative beats from George Lucas’s original trilogy. In the opening scene, First Order Supreme Leader Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) discovers the lair of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), who cheated his apparent demise in The Return of the Jedi and, it turns out, secretly orchestrated major events in the last two films. Shrouded in darkness, Palpatine more than ever resembles a living corpse, and his plan to unite enemies Ren and Rey (Daisy Ridley) and reestablish the evil Sith guild is just the first of the film’s many instances of gloomy Lazarus-ism. The Rise of Skywalker features no less than six characters who circumvent their mortal end. It’s as if the film is as afraid of finality as the characters are unwilling to succumb to death. That’s not to mention the return of the real-life deceased, with Carrie Fisher appearing on screen (in unused footage intended for The Force Awakens) as Leia Organa, and, like the revived Palpatine, casting a funereal pall over several scenes. Leia commands Poe (Oscar Isaac), Finn (John Boyega), and Rey to find an ancient Sith relic that will allow the Resistance to somehow defeat the First Order. And “somehow” will have to suffice in lieu of a detailed plot summary because the film is so dedicated to a revolving door policy of MacGuffins, side plots, locations, and character motivations that the result is inarticulate narrative chaos. It’s enough to say that story arcs that began with The Force Awakens—Rey’s temptation by the Dark Side, Leia’s longing to win back Ren from the clutches of the First Order—are largely resolved, though to what degree of satisfaction for the Star Wars faithful remains to be seen. If the cast is any indication, by the end of this nine-part saga fans might be more worn out than exulted. Flop-sweating through a numbingly paced succession of battles that increasingly take place in dimly lit and desolate settings, even the younger actors look fatigued and are in no part helped by rote and apathetic cameos from Mark Hamill and other surprise Star Wars alumni. Hyper-aware of the shadow cast by the franchise’s history, The Rise of Skywalker struggles to both honor and redeem the past before everything comes to a close. This is especially evident in its negation and autocritique of several controversial elements from The Last Jedi. As introduced in that film, plucky Resistance fighter Rose (Kelly Marie Tran) was met by fans with a lukewarm response, and so in The Rise of Skywalker she’s been effectively sidelined. Elsewhere, Luke Skywalker’s (Hamill) flippant response when handed back his lightsaber in The Last Jedi—a moment that had legions of fans up in arms—is slyly chastised. Most notably, though, Rey’s origins have been repealed: Whereas The Last Jedi dismissed her parents as “nobodies,” The Rise of Skywalker course-corrects from this revelation to steer the saga back along the path of mythic heroism. These revisions will likely be greeted by many viewers with welcome relief, but they also signal creative defeat and exacerbate the undertone of pathetic resignation that pervades the film. From Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time…in Hollywood to Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, American cinema in 2019 has regarded the unforgiving passage of time—and with it the decline of conventional cinema as our culture’s most influential and vital art form—with sadness, regret, and surrender. The biggest surprise of The Rise of Skywalker—formulaic to a tee and enslaved to its own legacy—comes not from its characters or storylines, but from a mood of decay that aligns with the current state of the medium. In most of its conversations and action set pieces, the film is dark, fearful, and ready to give up the ghost; the denouement doesn’t repeat The Return of the Jedi’s celebratory triumph, but instead just lets out a long overdue exhalation. For 40-plus years, Stars Wars has served as the movies’ Death Star, resurrecting into ever more colossal, if derivative, iterations of its original self in order to remain at the forefront of too-big-to-fail cinema. Now that other franchises have become more lucrative and more culturally impactful, and now that cinema itself seems to no longer need the spectacular format nor command the market through which Star Wars made its fortune, The Rise of Skywalker signals the end of the Death Star—not the films themselves (more sideshows to the nine-film saga are on their way), but their artistic hegemony. That this saga ended so solemnly, and with so much crippling self-consciousness and anxiety over its own lasting importance, would have once been unimaginable.

"Dec 18, 2019"," In 2017, Lucasfilm released what can now arguably be called the most polarizing chapter in the Star Wars franchise. There are many that absolutely love Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, particularly for the way it subverts expectations and takes the larger story in fascinating, unexpected directions; while others share contrasting opinions because they don’t feel it fits in the box they see defining what Star Wars is. The debate has raged for 24 months, and a huge part of the conversation has been in regard to how the particular narrative choices would impact the coming sequel, J.J. Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Recognizing the way in which Johnson took elements that Abrams introduced in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and effectively turned them on their head, the ideal circumstances would have seen the director (along with co-writer Chris Terrio) doing the exact same thing: taking what Johnson did and building on it to ultimately create a satisfying conclusion to the Sequel Trilogy that would also be cohesive with everything that came before it. Sadly, however, that was evidently a direction that Abrams didn’t have any interest in taking. Instead of further exploring the most fascinating developments from The Last Jedi – many of which were totally set up on a tee – J.J. Abrams decided to play revisionist with Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, and in doing so created a mess. Not only does the new blockbuster make actual efforts to totally undo important revelations in The Last Jedi and entirely ignore others, but the backtracking that he needs to perform in order to make it happen winds up creating a story that is all over the place, only eventually finding any footing by underwhelmingly echoing Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi the same way that Abrams’ The Force Awakens echoed Star Wars: A New Hope. Naturally, a great number of things can’t be discussed in this spoiler-free forum, which admittedly includes the single most problematic aspect of the film, but the point comes across simply enough identifying the previously introduced ideas that are completely absent in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker. Remember that triumphant return of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) at the Battle of Crait that was supposed to reignite hope in the universe? Apparently it did absolutely nothing. Remember the reemergence of belief in/democratization of the Force evidenced by a stablehand on Canto Bight summoning a broom? It’s not explored any further. Even key relationships that were vital to the previous chapter get precisely zero seconds of screen time in the new blockbuster. Say what you will about the way in which Rian Johnson further developed J.J. Abrams’ characters and story from The Force Awakens, but at least he picked up the ball and ran with it. In the making of Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, Abrams’ move is to punt the ball back in the opposite direction, let some air out of it, and then exhaust himself trying to run it all the way back to where he thinks it should be. Because he is a Star Wars equivalent of an originalist, J.J. Abrams’ perspective on that direction is to trace the Original Trilogy as closely as he can, and while that was tolerable with his first Star Wars movie, his second attempt is far less successful. The Force Awakens may be a remakequel of the original Star Wars, but it also did a spiffy job establishing the state of the universe 30 years after the events of Return of the Jedi and introduced a brilliant ensemble of new heroes and villains in Daisy Ridley’s Rey, John Boyega’s Finn, Oscar Isaac’s Poe, and Adam Driver’s Kylo Ren. That’s not an advantage present in Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker – though we do get a cool-yet-mostly-pointless new character in Keri Russell’s helmeted Zorii Bliss. Rather than the film exploring Kylo Ren’s further decent into the Dark Side as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, the movie wastes no time putting the thought-dead Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) back in play as a puppet master orchestrating the fight between Sith and the Jedi while bringing new super weapons to the table (this time it’s a fleet of Star Destroyers rather than a new Death Star, for what it’s worth). This philosophy forces the film to look in the wrong directions when it comes to questions that it attempts to answer, resulting in the bad kind of fan service. Miscalculated revisions of The Last Jedi is part of this, as well as playing things far too safe, but it’s primarily an issue when it comes to unnecessary callbacks that feel like they are cloying and/or pandering, and more importantly don’t actually add to the story in meaningful ways (Billy Dee Williams’ entire role basically exists to simply confirm that Lando Calrissian is still alive). It’s also an issue of looking too deeply into the past and not enough into the future. As the final chapter of the Skywalker Saga, it has a certain responsibility to answer particular questions about the status of the universe, both on a big picture scale and when it comes to individual characters, but it’s not actually satisfying in that regard and leaves multiple threads dangling (including some that it itself weirdly creates, such as the nebulous relationship between Rey and Finn). What thankfully does stay consistent (and what is undoubtedly the most agreeable aspect of the entire Sequel Trilogy) is the wonderful aesthetics, as once again J.J. Abrams and his team have delivered beautiful and eye-popping sequences brought to life with both remarkable special effects and outstanding visual effects. The costume and creature effects are both beautiful and impressive, with standouts being the aforementioned Zorii Bliss and the adorable droidsmith Babu Frik, who is the latest in a long line of cute scene-stealers in this franchise, and once again we are treated to some awesome production design as the story transports audiences to numerous brand new worlds. J.J. Abrams collaborating once again with cinematographer Dan Mindel, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker also features what are honestly some of the greatest lightsaber battles we’ve seen in these movies, with Rey and Kylo Ren going toe-to-toe multiple times throughout the adventure. Part of the excitement comes from excellent location choices and exciting choreography, but a great deal comes from the intensity between the hero and villain – a relationship you’re left wishing had a much more satisfying payoff. While it’s easy to see why Lucasfilm wanted to put J.J. Abrams back at the helm for Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker following the success of The Force Awakens and the untimely passing of Carrie Fisher, it’s unfortunate that his vision comes across as compromised. Another filmmaker could have taken the last chapter of the Skywalker Saga in a dynamic direction following The Last Jedi, but it’s made tremendously clear that Abrams only wanted to end this trilogy on his own terms, which is to say by delivering his personal answers to the questions that he left totally open-ended in his 2015 blockbuster. Albeit it was impossible for him to see the circumstances coming, the fact that he chose not to have a stronger voice in the making of the previous chapter has resulted in a Frankenstein’s monster of a movie this time out. It’s hard to even tell who it’s even really for, as it’s borderline insulting to those who legitimately appreciate the merits of The Last Jedi, and too chaotic to be seen as satisfying for those open to its revisionist choices – especially after serious reflection.

"Dec 18, 2019"," My therapist has forbidden me, for good reason, from wading too far into the whole debate about 2017’s The Last Jedi—the second film in the new Star Wars trilogy that continues the Skywalker saga—but it is my cursory understanding that some Star Wars fans do not like that movie. If those gripes were made loudly enough for me to hear, they probably made their way to Disney, too. Which could explain why the final film in this trilogy, The Rise of Skywalker (out December 20), feels like such a desperate scramble to win back fans’ affection, to re-create that probably uncapturable sense of awe conjured up by the original series. The movie never rests, relentlessly ardent in its grasping for mythos. The movie is directed by J.J. Abrams, who kicked off this latest set of films with 2015’s zippily winning The Force Awakens, a retailoring of the Luke Skywalker story that had a pretty well-laid track to follow. Not so for Rise of Skywalker, which tasks itself with an exhausting double duty: tying up the strands of a scattered series in some satisfying fashion while also attending to fussier fans’ Last Jedi tantrums, an atoning for supposed sins. Abrams is a talent, but he’s no match for a corporate mandate that heavy—his sleek, Spielbergian whimsy isn’t enough to cut through all the tortured brand maintenance. But he thrashes away anyway, filling Rise of Skywalker with a million moving parts. It’s a turgid rush toward a conclusion I don’t think anyone wanted, not the people upset about whatever they’re upset about with The Last Jedi (I feel like it has something to do with Luke being depressed, and with women having any real agency in this story) nor any of the more chill franchise devotees who just want to see something engaging. It’s technically illegal for me to tell you anything about the plot of Rise of Skywalker, I think, but I’ll risk censure by giving you the vaguest outline. When the movie opens, Rey (Daisy Ridley) is continuing her Jedi training while her friends Finn (John Boyega) and Poe (Oscar Isaac) are gallivanting around the galaxy getting information about the dreaded First Order from a mole within that fascist organization. Elsewhere, conflicted emo prince Kylo Ren (Adam Driver, entirely checked-out) is in search of something rather serious, something that’s the key to unlocking both the past and the future of this whole dynastic melodrama. I am definitely not supposed to tell you what that something is. I will say, though, that its reveal—and a subsequent, related reveal—would be genuinely frustrating were they not so obvious, and so silly. I found it hard to care much either way about Rise of Skywalker, neither betrayed nor sated. The movie is too determinedly on its sweaty course, heedless of actual audience interest in its tunnel-visioned quest to be broadly loved or, at least, Internet approved-of. The action set-pieces—a desert chase during an alien version of Burning Man, a rescue mission in a starship brig (unfavorably reminiscent of the one in the first film), an airborne melee full of radio squawk and explosions—all hurry along with perfunctory plainness. There’s a passion lacking in the movie’s big scenes (and, really, in the little ones too), as if Abrams was woken up in the middle of the night and told to rush down to the studio to put out a fire started by some intern named Rian. In that way, the film is an interesting study in how mega studios react to fan feedback, a whole movie crafted out of Sonic the Hedgehog’s retextured fur. There doesn’t seem to be any real organic idea animating Rise of Skywalker; instead it feels cobbled together from notes stuffed in the suggestion boxes of Reddit and Twitter. Which is awfully cynical. (The way this film handles the unfairly maligned Last Jedi character played by Kelly Marie Tran—which is to say, by completely sidelining her for this last outing—feels like a bad concession to bad people.) It’s sad, too, all this lifeless bombast made to appease some vague idea of a pure Star Wars fan. I don’t think Rise of Skywalker is ill-intentioned, exactly—it’s not malevolent like some joyless tentpole films are. But it takes no pleasure in its own existence, weakly adding some cutesiness here and there to liven things up (mostly in the form of a new droid whose existence feels redundant at best) but otherwise shuffling around morosely as it does what it thinks it needs to, piteously unaware that it didn’t have to be like this. Or, I dunno, maybe it did. Maybe there was no way Disney was going to allow a final (for now) chapter that takes any lively risks, that doesn’t tightly bind the latest IP to the original IP, a snug package of content that can self-reinforce as it appreciates in value, sitting and fermenting in the newly ajar Disney vault. Maybe Rise of Skywalker is mere fait accompli, the inevitably boring end to all the fun. (There was some fun along the way!) In that, the movie could be a valuable life lesson for its younger viewers: get your kicks out in your first couple acts, kids, because the final one is gonna be about settling accounts and trying to graft some canned sense of profundity on to it all before you’re done. Oof. I don’t want to end this review on too much of a down note. So, here are some things I did like about Rise of Skywalker. In one sequence we see the hulking wreck of the Death Star from Return of the Jedi, looming in the distance as a potent, and poignant, reminder of all the stars and all the wars that have come before. There’s a deliciously hammy turn from a particular actor whose name I won’t mention, but you’ll know who I’m talking about when you see them. And, it must be said, there is a sweet new lil’ alien guy that we meet in the movie, a wee tinkerer named Babu Frik who has a funny voice (done by the great Shirley Henderson) and is very small and has a frown. With his grumpy old man moue, he could be the miniature Mr. Wilson to Baby Yoda’s Dennis the Menace, maybe. Which, hey, reminds me: if you want some of the real good times of Star Wars, all that scrappy space marauding and oddball pluck that made the original films so endearing, you could just watch The Mandalorian on Disney+. Your subscription fee will be less than the cost of a ticket, and you won’t have to worry about parking. Which is exactly the kind of mundane thing you worry about when you get older, once life’s giddy wonder has dimmed and begins to, all too often, give way to the wan disappointments of responsibility.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The heroes of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker talk so much about endings and last chances you’d swear they know they’re involved in the final movie of a 40-year mega-franchise. They talk about taking “one last jump” to lightspeed on the Millennium Falcon, and refer to Rey as their “last hope,” and wistfully announce they’re taking “one last look” at their friends before saying goodbye. The burden of wrapping up a 40-year franchise weighs heavily on Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, an overstuffed chase film that barely lets up from its connect-the-dots MacGuffin-heavy plot for even a second or two. In dialogue like these examples and many more, the movie wears that burden on its sleeve, hoping to suck every last drop of nostalgia and affection for these characters and their galaxy out of the audience. That the movie is even occasionally successful in that endeavor, even in the face of some truly clunky plotting and a dreadful ending, is a credit to the strength of those characters and that galaxy. If this really is a short-term farewell for Star Wars, it’s a bittersweet one. It’s sad to say goodbye to these people in the first place, and it’s even sadder to do so in what’s by far the weakest installment of the trilogy inaugurated in 2015’s The Force Awakens and continued in 2017’s The Last Jedi. Unlike both of its predecessors, which blended enormous sci-fi action set pieces with a lot of quieter character moments and serious contemplation about the nature of good and evil, The Rise of Skywalker is basically one action scene after another. Even before the famous Star Wars title crawl, evil Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from the Star Wars prequels and Return of the Jedi returns from the dead to pose a new threat to the galaxy and the heroes of the Resistance, including former scavenger turned Jedi Rey (Daisy Ridley), former Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega), and hotshot X-wing pilot Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac). Palpatine’s return also has major implications for the First Order and its leader, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) who naturally forms an alliance with Palpatine. Their relationship is more complex than it initially appears — and in fact the connections between several characters evolve in unexpected ways over the course of the film as long-buried truths come to light. That style of storytelling is a trademark of director J.J. Abrams, who returned to co-write and direct The Rise of Skywalker after inaugurating this Star Wars trilogy with The Force Awakens. Since his days in television, Abrams’ has loved to layer mysteries, conspiracies, and secrets through his stories. The Force Awakens dangled all kinds of tantalizing plot threads, he can now dutifully tie together in The Rise of Skywalker — even when that means ignoring (or outright negating) some of the story developments in the trilogy’s middle chapter, The Last Jedi, which was written and directed by Rian Johnson. Johnson’s film was beloved by many fans, and disliked by others. It would seem, based on The Rise of Skywalker, that Abrams largely agreed with the latter group’s complaints. For better or worse, his Rise of Skywalker gives the vocal naysayers precisely what they asked for in an Episode IX. At times, the film literally announces its intentions to (sky) walk back The Last Jedi, as when the trio of Resistance heroes loudly declare they are going on this big adventure together, and that they will win this time by sticking together, after one of the criticisms of The Last Jedi was that the heroes spent too much time apart. The results overall have a real be-careful-what-you-wish-for vibe. The team stays together — and most of the movie strikes the same, loud note over and over, with Rey, Finn, and Poe getting into one interchangeable shootout after another. The characters literally say they want to have conversations with one another about important topics and then never do — they simply don‘t have the time amidst all the plot machinations. And without spoiling them, Abrams’ big galaxy-rattling revelations retroactively make a lot of the events of The Force Awakens more implausible, and more coincidental. A final battle meant to evoke the conclusion of Return of the Jedi contains so many unmotivated twists and surprises that the whole film nearly collapses just as it reaches what should be the emotional climax. The only thing holding it together is the wonderful cast, particularly Daisy Ridley as the soulful Rey and Adam Driver as the conflicted Kylo Ren. Abrams and co-writer Chris Terrio’s script pushes Kylo in some questionable directions; Driver’s full-throttle performance sells every single one of them. His work here, in comparison with many of the most infamous moments in the Star Wars prequels, does make you realize how much of the material in all the Star Wars movies is very silly. Sometimes the only difference between the stuff that works and the stuff that doesn’t is the quality of the actors involved. Even if The Rise of the Skywalker is a disappointment, the recent trilogy produced the very good Force Awakens and the great The Last Jedi — and introduced a host of new Star Wars characters who’ve brought new life to the franchise. The survivors will almost certainly return again, in some movie or Disney+ TV show; I’ll be happy to see all of them. Despite its underwhelming ending, I’ve enjoyed a lot of the time I’ve spent in this galaxy. There’s a saying in Star Wars that feels applicable here: “The journey is often more important than the destination.” -Fans of Rose Tico, the inexplicably controversial supporting character introduced in The Last Jedi, will not be pleased with her role (or lack thereof) in The Rise of Skywalker. -The best new cast addition — really the only new cast addition that makes any kind of impression — is a droidsmith named Babu Frik, a tiny critter who plays an important role in extracting a vital piece of information from a robot. He’s little! He’s funny! He’s a cool practical effect! -The biggest returning name in The Rise of Skywalker has to be Billy Dee Williams, playing Lando Calrissian for the first time since Return of the Jedi. He’s charming! His part is small! It’s nice to see him back in the Falcon again! -Top-billed credit in the film belongs to Carrie Fisher, even though she passed away before principal photography on The Rise of Skywalker even began. General Leia’s role in the movie, mostly cobbled together from deleted footage from The Fore Awakens, is larger than I expected and mostly unnecessary to the story. It’s a shame Fisher didn’t get to perform whatever ending Abrams and the rest of the creative team initially had in mind. Maybe that goes for the film as a whole as well.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away…42 years to be exact, a film hit theaters and forever changed the way we view science fiction movies.  Star Wars: A New Hope told the classic story of rebels warring against a powerful regime but offers the story with an intergalactic twist.  It made instant stars of Carrie Fischer (The Blues Brothers), Mark Hamill (Kingsman: The Secret Service) and Harrison Ford (Raiders of the Lost Ark) and created a franchise that has grown to epic proportions and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon.  The highly anticipated final chapter in the multi-decade saga, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,  opens in theaters nationwide on December 20, 2019.  The first three films introduced us to the struggle between the Rebel Alliance and the Empire and began our fascination with the main characters – Luke Skywalker (Hamill), Princess Leia (Fischer), Hans Solo (Ford) and Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones; Field of Dreams).  After the initial trilogy, there was a 16-year hiatus until the prequels came around in the late 1990s, the last of which was released in 2005.   It took another decade before the seventh, eighth and ninth films would once again create a frenzy at the box office and officially end the legend of the Jedi and the Skywalker lineage. While there have been spinoff movies  - A Star Wars Story: Solo and A Star Wars Story: Rogue One -  neither matches the intensity or the anticipation of the nine movies in the series.  Those of us who are 45 years old and above, can remember have seen the first three movies on the big screen and the impact it made on the nation.  In the latest two films, The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, we were introduced to the next generation of Jedi and evil villains in the form of a young scavenger named Rey (Daisy Ridley;  Murder on the Orient Express) and her counterpart,  Lord Kylo Ren (Adam Driver; Marriage Story).  While Rey tries to save Kylo/Ben from his darker nature, Kylo wants to push Rey over to the ""Dark Side"".  Ridley and Driver are well suited for their respective roles.  He portrays a man who is deeply conflicted with his chosen path and she offers some tenderness and vulnerability while producing an inner strength she didn't know she possessed.   The supporting cast members, including Oscar Isaac (Ex Machina), John Boyega (Pacific Rim: Uprising) and a host of other actors, help these two main stars shine. The story offers some interesting twists and the plot really focuses on the struggles of Rey and Ben.   While the ending should leave audiences satisfied, there is a bittersweet feeling to it all.  The visuals we well done for the most part but some of the scenes look fake which can be distracting and humorous all at the same time.  There is some humor mixed in that will either make you laugh or disgust you if you happen to be a Star Wars purist. The are several surprises that will thrill fans and the movie beautifully pays homage to all that has come before them.  Unfortunately,  This last one didn't really have the ""feel"" of a Star Wars movie and the two hours and twenty minutes running time is unnecessarily long.  One of the biggest surprises (that I'm sure was Abrams' idea) will have people audibly gasp while another scene will have some smiling. While this isn't the best of the Star Wars franchise, it certainly fairs better than Episode 1, 2 and 3.  People will be flocking to the theaters this weekend for the finale and the movie will certainly gross higher in ticket sales that anyone could truly imagine.

"Dec 18, 2019","The action sequences are among the best of the series. Particularly stunning is a pitched battle at sea, with Rey and Kylo Ren trading blows atop floating bits of wreckage as towering waves crash all around -- this entire sequence is instantly iconic.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," JJ Abrams is back at the helm for Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and this final installment in the latest trilogy is an emotional and action-packed ride that will make your head spin, but not always in a good way. There is plenty of joy to be found in this offering, much of it when Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Finn (John Boyega) are joined by Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) on far-flung adventures across the galaxy. It’s such a treat to see these beloved characters together at last. (Though even then, Rey is often off searching her feelings.) Ridley and Adam Driver are once again absolutely electrifying when on screen together. The chemistry and conflict between Rey and Kylo is a sight to behold, especially when they fight so impressively and so fuelled by raw emotion. Among this ensemble, it is Ridley who leads here, shining brightly as Rey and more than holding her own at the film’s heart. Rey is the one learning to follow her instincts and the one who has to make the decision that will affect so many around her and it’s intriguing to watch not fully knowing which way she will go. Visually, The Rise of Skywalker is relentless in its pursuit of spectacle. Shifting between different landscapes and set pieces, the film is rich with colour and wonder. One sequence, in particular, is an energetic delight for the senses. Sadly, this largely delectable palette is ruined by large sections of the film being so reliant on strobe lighting. It’s distracting and unnecessary and takes you out of the moment. The screenplay, co-written by Abrams and Chris Terrio, needed to bring a lot of strands together and juggle a lot of subplot. And though the screenplay certainly manages to get through a lot, it also comes off a little disjointed and lacking in focus. The tone shifts from light-hearted humour and silliness to raw emotional intensity quite a bit and it doesn’t always land well. The result is that no clear leader is there, as Rey would say, to take their place in all this. So it’s hard to know who you’re with for this journey. It also means that characters like Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), who had been firmly established previously as someone of importance to our core team, are left with very little to do while new characters are introduced who don’t, despite the actors’ best efforts, have the time necessary to make us care about them. The Rise of Skywalker may be a touch disjointed but there’s still a lot to love. There are many surprises and treats for audiences and moments of fan service that are sure to have fans cheering with delight. The droids continue to steal the show and there are some moments of absolute perfection to be found within. Though some plot points might be seen as being too predictable or easy, the overall feel of the film is that of a celebration of this incredible world that was built so long ago and, of course, the iconic people who made it so beloved. The Rise of Skywalker is an exhilarating and emotional end to the saga, full of action, delight and visual splendour. It’s just a shame it couldn’t have been reached with a slightly smoother landing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, the ninth film in the official Star Wars saga, the third in the current Star Wars sub-trilogy and the fifth live-action Star Wars movie released by Disney in the space of four years and two days, is, against all of the above odds, a good movie. That doesn’t mean it’s without problems, though, and I’m going to start with those, only so I can shift the cool stuff I really want to talk about–which aren’t really spoilers but might be interpreted as such by only the most sensitive die-hards–into later paragraphs in case you decide to stop here, wait until you see the movie and then come back to read the rest.  J.J. Abrams returns to the franchise as director and one of the main faults of The Force Awakens, his previous effort, is back with him, though thankfully in smaller doses. If huge chunks of that movie felt like watching a rerun, only occasional bits operate the same way here, mostly in the form of returning characters from the original trilogy and obligatory inclusions like someone saying, “I got a bad feeling about this,” which even the actor says like they’re crossing it off a list. The Rise of Skywalker has fewer plot-centric issues than The Force Awakens mainly because Abrams and co-screenwriter Chris Terrio don’t include much plot at all. The movie sets up its very straightforward goals so quickly that it’s almost disorienting. After that, though, our main characters are off and running, this time on a single group mission, at least for most of the running time. That will come as a relief to those who felt that Rian Johnson’s The Last Jedi (a superior film in pretty much every other way) suffered from an imbalance in its divided trajectories. Now on to the cool stuff. Though The Rise of Skywalker doesn’t have quite the abundance of it as The Last Jedi, where Johnson rammed something visually and/or conceptually interesting into every scene, the film does feel altogether more free, loose and fun than The Force Awakens. There’s a character with such convincingly decrepit make-up and prostheses that his scenes feel like they’re out of a horror movie. Then there’s a delightful fantasy universe-expanding detour to a hippie-ish, renaissance fair, Burning Man type festival full of dancing aliens. And then there’s further muddying of the droid sentience question properly invoked in Ron Howard’s Solo with new robot D-O, who behaves like a traumatized rescue dog. And finally there’s the astral projection laser sword fight between two people who happen to be in entirely different places. Though it’s not the film’s most thrilling action scene, it’s the most innovative and engaging one. That ability–of two people imbued with the franchise’s mystical energy The Force to reach across space to one another–was used in The Last Jedi to highlight the connection between this trilogy’s hero, Rey (Daisy Ridley), and its villain, Kylo Ren (Adam Driver). The Rise of Skywalker continues strengthening that bond until the deepest relationship in these three films is between two people who have spent very little actual time together. It’s in one of these chats that Kylo remarks to Rey that, even though he doesn’t want to do something, he will if it comes to it. The moment stands out because Rey says something very similar to General Organa (Carrie Fisher) only a few scenes prior. Later, Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) suggests the inverse to Zorii Bliss (Keri Russell), implying that there’s something he very much wants to do but won’t. On the surface, these lines of dialogue can be taken as platitudes about doing the right thing or the greater good or what have you. But, taken together, they seem to reinforce the franchise’s long held philosophy of determinism (despite Johnson’s attempts to undo it). George Lucas, the property’s creator, developed a world in which fate and future were decided by blood and birth. The Rise of Skywalker appears to up the ante. Finn (John Boyega) is a former Stormtrooper, a soldier in a fascist army of the evil First Order, who tossed aside his conditioning and became part of the Resistance. The reminder that every Stormtrooper is a brainwashed flesh and blood individual may inspire some second thoughts about the scores of them we see getting blown away in every movie. Here, though, Finn has a short monologue that may salve your conscious. He says that his defection wasn’t a decision he made but an instinct, “a feeling.” Star Wars, this entry suggests, takes place in a universe governed by seemingly divine predestination. Those bad Stormtroopers were always going to be bad and Finn was always going to be good. The Resistance are a band of radical Calvinists or, more fittingly, Huguenots. The First Order is the persecuting French government. That would be something to chew on during The Rise of Skywalker‘s duller moments, except there are so very few of those. Fans of the series will thrill to the cute aliens, the superficial pathos and the almost non-stop action sequences punctuated by corny lines that kind of sound like jokes but aren’t really. It’s always been easy to make fun of and poke holes in a Star Wars movie. This one in particular, though, is just as easy to lean back and enjoy.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Now after the following image of BB-8 and D-0, we’ll get into a bit about the storyline. However, I’ll not go into it any further than what is seen in the trailers. So with that caveat, let’s get on to the rest of the review. Roughly one year has passed since the events of “The Last Jedi,” and while Rey has been continuing her Jedi training under the tutelage of General Leia, the rest of the Rebels have been out trying to foil the plans of the First Order and their new Supreme Leader Kylo Ren. There have been transmissions across the galaxy that Emperor Palpatine might not be as dead as everyone might have thought. Carrie Fisher’s General Leia does have an impressive number of scenes that work well, given that they were from footage left over from “The Force Awakens” and “The Last Jedi.” They get away with most of it by having over the shoulder shots from behind Leia when the other characters are talking, then jump to a frontal shot of her when it’s time for her to respond. It works well, though every scene with her is a tug on the emotions. There are a lot of emotions in play in Episode IX- the culmination of a saga 42 years in the making, including multiple television series, now eleven feature films, and one “Christmas Special.” It doesn’t entirely get away from some similar story beats as there were in Jedi, but not anywhere near as templated as it was in “The Force Awakens,” and in most of the cases, things pivot into directions that they didn’t before. The battles are spectacular (and if you think there’s a lot of rebel ships that appear in the trailer, that’s not a quarter of them when you see it in all its glory). If I have any real kvetch about the way that it wraps things up is that various characters were never really given that much to do – Rose Tico (played by Kelly Marie Tran) is around and throws in some random commentary, but that’s about the extent of it. The music cues borrow heavily from the original trilogy, and there’s never really much new added to the already-classic score to bring it to a new depth that is remembered past the scenes they’re used in. But at the same time, they do bring back Billy Dee Williams as Lando, and as we all had hoped, he’s played with aplomb. When I mentioned it’s a “better ending than we deserve,” it’s in reference to the long-running endless troll wars that have erupted online. Vitriol and hate flung at actors for delivering the lines as read, accusations at Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy of “ruining the franchise.” People from various generations have their own read as to what “Star Wars” was to them, and it varies wildly with what people brought to it and took away from it. Legions screaming for more like the prequels, more like the originals, make it different, keep it the same. With all of the crosswinds and second guessing that have been coming at them, “The Rise of Skywalker” could have as easily been an unbridled mess of trying to appease too many people. In the end, they chose their path and followed it. They do even wind up having a reasonable reason for the “space horses” that are seen in the trailer. So there is a method to their madness, and it pays off. By the end, there are decisions that were made that might have been differently; in other cases scenes that could have been cut without loss of story. With it’s two hour and twenty-plus minute running time, it never feels like it’s overstaying it’s welcome. And we know as we’re watching it that while this won’t be the end of Star Wars, this will be the end of this particular storyline. From intense scenes with the Falcon jumping through hyperspace to lightsaber duels to throwback references to earlier films throughout, it will likely wind up pleasing most of those who go to see it. The main ones that won’t be thrilled are those who have a very specific idea of what they wanted to see as their head-cannon storyline play out. By the end, they do bring it full circle.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," 
	No ""Star Wars"" film can fully recapture the thrill of 40 years ago, but as directed by J.J. Abrams, the ninth and final chapter in the saga that George Lucas created may come closer than any ""Star Wars"" movie since. In “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,” there’s a lightsaber duel that’s pretty fantastic — not because of any unprecedented whirling-action whoa! factor (we have, after all, been through one or two of these my-sword-of-electric-fire-is-mightier-than-your-sword-of-electric-fire duels in our “Star Wars” lifetimes), but because of the emotions it channels. Visually, it’s a splendid fight. Rey (Daisy Ridley), the Jedi Knight who’s in the midst of trying to figure out, you know, who she is, and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the First Order commander who’s certain that he’s figured out the Dark Side badass he is, face off outdoors, standing atop the ruins of the Death Star, a wasteland of corroded metal that looks like the aftermath of some intergalactic 9/11. As stormy black ocean waves crash and churn around them, like something out of “Wuthering Heights,” Ren uses his red Sith lightsaber, with the cross-handle that makes it look like a pulsating version of Excalibur; Rey uses her trusty blue Jedi lightsaber. After much fateful combat, a saber is plunged, and there’s a clear victor — but then something quite unexpected happens. It’s game-changing, it’s powerful and moving, and at that moment it’s everything you want from a “Star Wars” film. In 1977 and 1980, “Star Wars” and “The Empire Strikes Back” were two movies that the whole wide world agreed on (to put it in fanboy terms: that they were the greatest things ever). And that’s part of why they changed the world. The universality of the adoration for “Star Wars” became one of the cornerstones of its aesthetic. In the 40 years since, there has been less to agree on about “Star Wars,” which may be one reason why this distended-through-the-decades space-opera odyssey now feels, by turns, inspiring and dispiriting. Most agree, at least, that the George Lucas prequels were an eye-popping but empty experiment in technologically driven brand enhancement. Yet that isn’t exactly a consensus to take heart in. And the last two films? Fans fell hard for “The Force Awakens,” until they woke up and realized that they’d been seduced by a kind of painstakingly well-traced “Star Wars” simulacrum. “The Last Jedi” was admired by some and disliked by many, with the divide often carrying an ugly subtext: a resentment at the film’s diversity casting, while others leapt to its defense for that very reason, turning what was supposed to be a piece of escapism into an ideological turf war as messy and overblown as some of us thought the movie itself was. “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” might just brush the bad-faith squabbling away. It’s the ninth and final chapter of the saga that Lucas started, and though it’s likely to be a record-shattering hit, I can’t predict for sure if “the fans” will embrace it. (The very notion that “Star Wars” fans are a definable demographic is, in a way, outmoded.) What I can say is that “The Rise of Skywalker” is, to me, the most elegant, emotionally rounded, and gratifying “Star Wars” adventure since the glory days of “Star Wars” and “The Empire Strikes Back.” (I mean that, but given the last eight films, the bar isn’t that high.) It’s a puckish and engrossing movie, fulsome but light on its rocket feet. At two hours and 28 minutes, is it too long? Yes. Does it feature several dead characters coming all too conveniently back to life? Yes. (Actual dialogue: “Somehow, Palpatine returned.” “Wait, do we believe this?” And no, that’s not a spoiler. It’s revealed in the opening 20 minutes.) If you look past its foibles, though, “The Rise of Skywalker” has been directed, by J.J. Abrams (the script is by Abrams and Chris Terrio), with much the same neo-classic-Lucas precision and crispness and verve that he brought to “The Force Awakens,” though in this case with less of the lockstep nostalgia that made that film such a direct clone of the first “Star Wars” that the thrill of going back to 1977 was mitigated by the fact that the entire thing had been transparently engineered to give you that feeling. It was like a pharmaceutical drug called Starzac. That said, maybe there’s no escaping that the final entry of this series, coming 42 years after the original “Star Wars,” is — at best — going to be less a brilliant piece of stand-alone escapism than a kind of exquisitely executed self-referential package. “The Rise of Skywalker” has rousingly edited battles, like the opening dogfight, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) trading quips as they race the Millennium Falcon back from an intel mission. It has the irresistible presence of old friends, like Gen. Leia Organa (the late Carrie Fisher), still guiding the Resistance and mentoring Rey, and an older and wiser but feisty-as-ever Gen. Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams, in his first part in the series since “Return of the Jedi,” wrapping his velvet baritone around lines like “I’ve got a bad feeling about this”), plus one or two other returning icons you might not expect. The story, abetted by trademark John Williams music cues that always manage to drop in at the perfect moment, is a digressive but satisfyingly forward-hurtling MacGuffin that stays on course. It follows Rey and her team as they bop from one planet to the next, all in order to locate the wayfinder crystal that will lead them to Exogol, the hidden land of the Siths where Palpatine, bent on domination of the galaxy, has set up his stone-throned, dark-shadowed supervillain hell cave. They find a dagger inscripted with the information they need — except that it’s written in the forbidden runes of the Sith, which C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) is programmed not to translate. So they have to travel to a renegade planet to find a black-market droid tech, who has to erase C-3PO’s memory. This may sound like a fancy form of time-killing, except that Isaac’s Han-lite renegade Poe, Boyega’s loyal cut-up Finn, and the usual nattering gang of rubbery cute beasts have now gotten into enough of a groove to evoke the “Guardians of the Galaxy” crew (who, of course, were a knockoff of the “Star Wars” team). “The Rise of Skywalker” also features what is far and away Daisy Ridley’s most accomplished performance as Rey. After all her Jedi training, Rey now has powers so advanced they’re dangerous (she detonates a spaceship with her grasping hand — and, it appears, blows up one of her comrades). Ridley wears Rey’s mission with furious charisma, bringing a possessed quality to the character, never more so than when she learns who she is. What makes her performance so much more than “diversity” casting is that “The Rise of Skywalker” pointedly completes the “Star Wars” saga as a myth embracing the rise of women. What no contemporary “Star Wars” movie can have, no matter how slavishly it imitates the template that Lucas invented, is the primal awe of the original films’ space battles. At the time, the gritty-yet-frictionless, zipping-through-the-canyons joystick stuff was miraculous. It anticipated the digital era, and the only place you could see it — could live it — was at a “Star Wars” film. But “Star Wars” turned Hollywood into an industry devoted to space-race fantasy and action candy. So the only real dimension of “Star Wars” that’s defining anymore is…the cosmology. No wonder the thrill isn’t there the way it was. “The Rise of Skywalker” has to deal some of with the anti-Lucas curveballs that director Rian Johnson introduced into “The Last Jedi,” and it may actually be a better movie for it. Rey and Ren, locked in mortal combat, commune through the cosmos, as if both were linked up to some advanced communication system called ForceTime. Ren’s murky moral ambivalence has been clarified — he now presides over the First Order in a mask modeled on his grandfather Darth Vader’s, though this one has glowing red cracks and a chrome grill that make it look like something off a ’70s album cover. And where, in “The Last Jedi,” Mark Hamill’s Luke was practically a doomsday nihilist, inviting the eradication of the Jedi (which was a bit loopy), Abrams draws his movie back from that ledge. He also does not send his characters on too many disparate missions, the way “The Last Jedi” did. For all its sprawl, “The Rise of Skywalker” is all of a piece. Palpatine is indeed alive, with Ian McDiarmid returning to play him, looking more like a rotting monk than ever. His desire to squash what’s left of the Resistance, and to establish a reign of total terror, may seem standard issue, but now, for the first time, it has a jolting topical resonance. The villainous forces of “Star Wars” were always a sci-fi variation on 20th-century fascism, and that made them, at the time, seem ominous but historically distant. But in “The Rise of Skywalker,” the fascism looms, for the first time, as something more real; it’s what we’re now facing. The film keeps repeating that though the forces of the First Order are actually outnumbered, those forces work to make the Resistance fighters feel isolated and alone, as if they had no power. And you’d better believe that’s a pointed and timely statement. In its way, it’s also a tip of the hat to George Lucas, who in the “Star Wars” saga drew on the pop culture of the past to create a revolutionary new pop culture, and in doing so foresaw the future. Maybe more than he knew.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019","It provides all the spectacle, adventure, and reveals you expect from a Star Wars finale, but with so much crammed into one film, it's not as satisfying as it should be.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (or Star Wars: Episode IX) is neither as conventional as Star Wars: The Force Awakens nor as surprising as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but it succeeds by synthesizing the two (with a dash of Indiana Jones) into a breakneck adventure that carries the spirit of George Lucas’ original Star Wars trilogy into a gratifying, delightfully bizarre denouement. This episode picks up about a year after The Last Jedi, with Jedi hopeful Rey (Daisy Ridley) training under General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher, posthumously), who is teaching her how to use the force in ways Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) never had a chance to during his tumultuous tutelage of the “Girl from Nowhere.” Rey is frustrated, angry and unsure where the fight is leading her and her friends. Sharing these frustrations are Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega), who are running missions using the Millennium Falcon. The year between episodes has been nothing but setbacks for the fledgling Resistance, whose SOS at the end of The Last Jedi has gone unanswered. It’s
difficult to talk about the best parts of The
Rise of Skywalker
without delving into spoiler territory, which is always a problem
covering these sorts of pop-cultural church sermons. I promise I’ve
done my best. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is now Supreme Leader, a role for which his suitability is questionable. He has spent the last year consolidating his power over the galaxy while searching for Rey. Their yin-and-yang Force relationship keeps them connected in ways they don’t quite understand. Driver’s body language says everything about his character this time around, especially when he’s wearing the dorky helmet. Calling it dorky isn’t an insult to the creative team; it’s literally part of the film’s text that the damn thing is poser bullshit because Kylo Ren is, fundamentally, projecting his own emotional weaknesses through aggression. He’s a boy desperately pretending to be a man in the worst ways possible. Like ol’ Palpatine, J.J. Abrams has also returned to the director’s chair. Abrams is a competent helmsman for franchise pictures because he is dedicated to rehashing what audiences already love about a franchise in newer, prettier ways. The Force Awakens is easily the weakest of this sequel trilogy, opening with a first act of beautiful mythology before succumbing to studio anxieties about whether the movie felt enough like Star Wars. When Abrams was announced to helm this chapter, there was some despair. When the credits rolled on the far superior The Last Jedi, the re-hiring of Abrams felt like even more of a downer. How could he live up? The Rise of Skywalker finds Abrams in a position unique to him: Rather than starting something, he’s forced to figure out how to end something. Endings are difficult as it is. But they seem to be particularly difficult for Abrams, who has steadfastly avoided them his entire career. Everything about this entry feels shaky, nervous, anxious. The first act is almost numbingly action-oriented, with every character getting a kinetic introduction. The following two require large amounts of questing, exposition and strangely awkward dialogue that may also be the fault of co-writer Chris Terrio. Longtime questions are answered, followed by new questions and new answers, ad infinitum. It is, truly, a unique Star Wars experience in and of itself. There has never been a franchise entry quite like this. Although the pacing may feel awkwardly fast to some (I, personally, really had zero issue with it), it’s kind of beside the point. This entry, like the last two, is grounded by another extraordinary performance by Ridley. She’s the not-so-secret weapon that makes this trilogy work. Her Rey is sometimes derided as a “Mary Sue” or some bullshit, given her capabilities in combat and with the Force. But Ridley’s Rey has always been a character who is so much more than her RPG skill points. It’s no different here. She’s the “Girl from Nowhere” who has always sought family, identity, and purpose. More importantly, she’s an inherently good person. She doesn’t seek heroic exploits but is heroic in her capacity for compassion and kindness to every creature she encounters. Her moral quandaries literally mirror Kylo Ren’s: Whereas he’s born from privilege and gives into the Dark Side to avoid facing himself, Rey is born from nothing and tempted by the Dark Side with opportunities to belong, to be defined, to let go of the abandonment issues that haunt her. Rey, more than Luke or Anakin, feels like a fleshed-out hero whose worst nightmares grow and evolve as she does. Again, it’s hard not to enter spoiler territory. I was moved by her performance, and the film’s twists, and think this movie does nothing to diminish Rey as one of the brightest stars in the Star Wars saga or her story (and the themes explored) carried over from The Last Jedi. The other two members of Rey’s “trio” of heroes are Finn and Poe, whose arcs are less fulsome than their roles in the previous film. On the flip side, they participate in the main action much more directly and have a lot of fun character interactions. It’s not that they get nothing to do, but their arcs aren’t as central. Is Leia’s return effective? Carrie Fisher’s untimely death in 2016 definitely poked holes in larger storylines that come to a close here, but Lucasfilm’s decision to use unused footage from production of  The Force Awakens (with CGI modifications) works well. Some seams show, but it is what it is. It’s hard to fault them for taking a thoughtful approach to including Fisher without resorting to the garish, morose corpse-mannequins of Rogue One. The Rise of Skywalker likely works best depending on how invested the audience is with the stories of Kylo Ren, Rey and the like. This is very much a movie with dual purposes, tying up an overarching nine-film story while focusing primarily on the characters who made this trilogy their home. But it really only works if you give a shit about the newbies. I clearly do. If the attraction of the sequel trilogy was solely to see old friends return, well, it may leave audiences at a loss. Oh well. This will, hopefully, persist much longer than a film that is just a parade of cameos and fanboy references (of which this still has plenty). I think, despite their faults, the sequel trilogy is a successful implementation of that idea. Although The Last Jedi is indisputably the crown jewel of the story, The Rise of Skywalker brings the characters to a stirring emotional conclusion that befits the franchise as a whole. Their lessons learned and actions taken echo and grow on those that came before. The spiritual center of Star Wars, at its best, has always been about how the personal decisions we make determine who we are. Light? Dark? Barometers in the measure of our souls. Being good is just as much a struggle as it is to be bad. Nobody is born a monster. Fear and failure can happen to anyone. No one is ever really gone. It’s all struggle. Love, compassion and the families we build for ourselves give us the strength to continue. The Force is a feeling, a truth that guides the galaxy far, far away. Let it in and let it guide you, but most of all, learn to guide yourself to do what is right. The Rise of Skywalker embraces this tenet of the franchise.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker features some very strange pacing, odd structure, and is likely the least cinematic of the new era of films but still features some truly breathtaking moments. Endings are difficult. Not just in the meta sense that coming to an ending in life is hard, but with storytelling. There is a sense that you should wrap everything up so no one is left asking questions. You want people to leave the theater or finish the book and feel satisfied that they witnessed some sort of journey come to an end. Endings are notoriously difficult to write under the best circumstances and coming into Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker were not the best circumstances. The third movie in this new trilogy was supposed to focus on Leia, but when Carrie Fisher passed away all of those plans got thrown out the window. This was a franchise with an extremely passionate fanbase, some of which have been wondering what this ending would look like for years. How can you possibly please so many people? You can't, but Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker tries to do so, and that might be the problem that is baked into the DNA of this movie. Whether or not you liked The Last Jedi is utterly irrelevant but it seems that after a movie of shaking things up, Lucasfilm and director J.J. Abrams returned to a much more traditional Star Wars movie to close out the saga. If The Force Awakens played homage to A New Hope then Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker pays homage to Return of the Jedi in both good and bad ways. This moviefeels much longer than its two hour and twenty-minute run time, which is indicative of poor pacing. Despite that over two-hour run time, this is not a movie that stops to smell the space roses at any time. Instead, this is a movie that keeps running so fast that massive plot points fly by without any time for the emotional weight to settle in. There is a lot to do before the credits roll, the movie seems to say, and we're going to do all of it. We have a lot to wrap up and we need to find a way to make sure there is something here for everyone. However, when you try to please everyone you usually just end up doing a mediocre job all around, which is the fate of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. The core concepts at the heart of this film are just fine. Once all of the pieces are on the board you know exactly how this movie is going to end save for a few small details. No one is trying to reinvent the wheel this time; instead, they are using a very familiar wheel that we all know all too well. But this works against the film, because we know these characters, we care about them, and everything is going so fast that we don't have many quiet moments with them. Those character beats are important because they are the things that turn good movies into great ones. We meet some new faces but there is hardly time for the mainstays of the trilogy to have room to breath, so people like  Naomi Ackie's Jannah or Keri Russel's Zorii Bliss are hardly given time to introduce themselves let alone have many quiet moments. Kelly Marie Tran's Rose gets almost nothing to do this time around and utterly wastes the empathy that was so crucial to her character last time. Character dynamics have shifted, but if you aren't reading the comics or the books you'd never know. We cannot get into a mindset where character development happens off-screen in books or comics that you have to read to understand the movies, but it seems that Lucasfilm is very much heading down that road. It's also strange that after how visually beautiful these Star Wars movies have been, this one feels very flat. There is something lacking from the cinematography this time around and none of the scenes seem to really pop. For a series that has been gorgeous in the past, this is, visually, incredibly lackluster. Abrams can make a good looking movie but this time that didn't appear to be a focus. This is Star Wars with the 900lbs gorilla that is Walt Disney backing you up; there is enough money to make a good looking film. All of this is not to say this is a bad movie. The cast continues to put in stellar work and it's very good to finally see Daisy Ridley, Oscar Isaac, and John Boyega working together as a team. While some of their character work has, again, happened off-screen our three leads have enough natural chemistry with each other that you believe they care about each other. They are the trio here to impact the galaxy in some massive way just like Anakin, Padme, and Obi-Wan and Luke, Leia, and Han before them. Adam Driver continues to show why he's one of the most interesting actors around as he puts his heart and soul into Kylo Ren. It's not easy to emote through a mask [just ask Pedro Pascal] but Driver is more than up to the task. While he doesn't have a ton to do it's lovely to see Billy Dee Williams return to the screen and credit must be given to Joonas Suotamo and Anthony Daniels for making Chewie and C-3PO the heart of this movie. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker might not be the perfect ending that everyone envisioned when they thought about the Skywalker Saga coming to a close but it's not a disaster either. We had a lot of pop culture endings this year with Marvel, Game of Thrones, the X-Men movies all closing the door in some way. Some have worked, like Marvel, and some biffed it big time like X-Men or Game of Thrones. The Rise of Skywalker falls squarely in the middle. There are moments when this movie truly soars and, when it does, you'll be reminded why you fell in love with this franchise in the first place. Endings are hard and saying goodbye always hurts. Sometimes, you get what you want from that goodbye and sometimes you don't. Everything still ends nevertheless and this is an ending whether it works for you or not.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Note: This is a spoiler-free review, so if you’re expecting any plot details, you’ll have to find some other hive of scum and villainy from which to get them.  Your reaction to JJ Abrams’ Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker will depend on a number of factors. If you were a big fan of Rian Johnson’s Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I want to go ahead and tell you to steel yourselves for disappointment: It’s about as bad of a sequel to Johnson’s masterpiece as you have feared. Abrams’ new film feels often like a point-by-point rebuttal of that film’s ethos, and it feels fan-driven in a way that some might consider gauche, as the things that Johnson rejected are often major points here. The movie often feels like it’s attempting to cram in both Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi into one two-and-a-half-hour period, and as a result, it has a breakneck pace that feels decidedly at odds with the rest of the franchise. This isn’t going to challenge you or the conventions of Star Wars in any meaningful way, and it feels as if Disney’s shareholders were driving the plot points here in a way that they weren’t with that film. The good news is that The Last Jedi does still exist for those who love it, and I’d argue that its messages are the thematic conclusion that the series deserved. The Rise of Skywalker, on the other hand, has a fundamentally different task on its hands: It’s trying to tie together three disparate trilogies into one fundamental whole.  And on that level, it’s actually pretty good. As a conclusion to the Skywalker Saga, as the whole of Star Wars has come to be called, The Rise of Skywalker is stronger than it might look at first glance and provides about as competent an ending that one could hope for from such a sprawling, weird saga. There are echoes of the best of the prequels here: The high-flying, Wuxia-styled lightsaber fights, the corrupting influence of Palpatine making itself manifest in all number of things, the tangible Jedi and Sith mysticism. The original trilogy’s camaraderie is still here, the propulsive and compelling storytelling influence that those films have on this new trilogy is resonant, and Abrams’ commitment to practical effects still works wonders at achieving a sense of tactile realism and alien wonder in plenty of scenes — an alien festival, a bar chockful of colorful characters. The new trilogy’s leads are once again very charming and swell when they’re put in situations together, and I think people who have grown enamored with them over the course of these few movies will appreciate where they end up. And, again, Abrams is an exceptionally capable director of action and of actors, so the film goes down easy, even if you’re struggling with some of the plot’s maneuvering.  If The Last Jedi was the new saga’s Empire Strikes Back, as its positioning (and thematic content) suggested, The Rise of Skywalker is most definitely its Return of the Jedi, a fittingly disappointing but ultimately satisfactory conclusion to this surprisingly strong series of new films. It will likely sate the uninvolved people who just enjoy the movies for what they are — very smart and wit-filled adventure serials — and the most die-hard fans, who accept what Lucasfilm and company have given them as gospel from the minute they hear it, even when it’s seemingly contradictory. It will likely piss off a whole host of other fans (and practically all other critics who appreciated Johnson’s entry), and should stoke the Fandom Wars all over again, and we’ll relitigate this trilogy over and over again, through podcasts and forum posts and convention gatherings and incredibly awkward first dates and such, until, a few years from now, Kathleen Kennedy and company decide to tell more theatrical stories in this universe. In essence, it is a Star Wars movie, and it’s about as good as you want it to be.  One final note: if you’re epileptic or have trouble with flashing lights, I’d recommend you either avoid or find something to help you through ‘The Rise of Skywalker’: A good portion of the film contains them. There’s a good aesthetic justification, so I don’t feel as frustrated with them as when they’re applied carelessly (‘Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom’, ‘Incredibles 2’). But it’s still worth a warning.

"Dec 18, 2019"," ""The dead speak!"" Those three words—the first three words of the last ""Skywalker Saga"" Star Wars film—will be the only spoiler in this review. I won't even say to what those three words literally refer, but they also carry a figurative promise of revival. J.J. Abrams has returned to the pilot's seat, steering the ship again toward old-school Star Wars faces and places, the better to conclude the nine-film cycle dealing with good-and-evil star wars and the rising and falling fortunes of the Skywalkers—Anakin, Luke, Leia, and Ben—with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. Few if any films in cinematic history face the scrutiny of a Star Wars film, and one can feel the added burden weighing on this ""concluding"" chapter. Abrams' return to the franchise, after launching the current trilogy with 2015's The Force Awakens and sitting out Rian Johnson's 2017 The Last Jedi, must bring satisfying closure to this trilogy's younger generation of characters—most notably Daisy Ridley's Rey and Adam Driver's Kylo Ren—and their current conflict between the righteous Resistance and the genocidal First Order, while also honoring the previous two trilogies overseen by franchise creator George Lucas. Post-Lucas Lucasfilm claims to have picked Lucas' brain for story ideas before commissioning the film's script, which hasn't stopped the rumor mill from churning and churning with unsubstantiated tales of disastrous test screenings, reshoots, and even a fabled unused cut purportedly supervised by Lucas. I didn't encounter any of these rumors before watching the film, but they would explain a lot about the disjointed narrative of The Rise of Skywalker, which at times feels wet with spackle. The inclusion of previously unused Carrie Fisher footage, while welcome, sets the film's awkward tone with General Leia Organa appearing to have been Photoshopped into her scenes. More than ever, Star Wars ostensibly exists for the fans, those who care deeply about the sprawling mythology, its worlds, its characters. Any rube could have walked into 1983's trilogy-ending Return of the Jedi as their first Star Wars movie and had a popcorn-munching good time, but in this era when peak-TV has become cinematic, and cinema has become episodic, The Rise of Skywalker plays to the well-informed blind-faithful and surely would have a non-initiate staring blankly at its fast-moving nonsense. Yes, screenwriters Abrams and Chris Terrio (Argo) pack in the requisite lightsaber battles, blaster shoot-outs, space dogfights, whooping critters, and fretfully chirping robots, but a lugubrious sense of duty hangs over the proceedings as the writers try to rescue the hash Lucasfilm has made of a Lucas-less Star Wars. The die-hard fans, who have the best shot of actually enjoying The Rise of Skywalker, are likely to have some serious complaints, and it's not inconceivable that it may be received as warmly as the finale of Game of Thrones (just six weeks ago, the Game of Thrones writers parted ways with a planned future Star Wars trilogy; draw your own PR conclusions). A hard-to-resist but creatively thin nostalgia machine, Abrams' The Force Awakens overdosed on comforting callbacks, while Rian Johnson's divisive The Last Jedi stepped lively in its own direction, with encouraging results. The Rise of Skywalker mostly rolls back Johnson's improvements, even as it makes a defensive ""meta"" joke in reference to The Force Awakens' copycat reputation: after our first look at an outdoor festival with dozens of line-dancing aliens, Rey remarks, ""I've never seen anything like this!"" (In keeping with this film rejecting The Last Jedi like a bad organ transplant, Kelly Marie Tran's Rose Tico gets demoted to a not-too-tiny-to-offend, not-too-large-to-rankle nothing part.) The Rise of Skywalker nearly gets by on its visual dazzle, toy-line-ready production design, and big action set pieces: the money is definitely all there on the screen (plus: cute banter!). But even at its best, this franchise-capper struggles to raise a pulse, to make its audience feel or care about the specifics of its complicated but slapdash plot beyond pre-existing goodwill for Star Wars itself and the saga's first female protagonist. For a brief, shining moment, The Rise of Skywalker perks up with a Lucas-esque twist of fate and good-evil duality, but the intriguing idea sorta just disappears into the film's creative quicksand along with everything else. With IP this big, ""It's fine, I guess"" just doesn't cut it as a reaction: once the initial excitement wears off and this one takes its place on the shelf, it's probably not going to get the kind of true love its predecessors enjoyed. If Abrams has topped himself, it's by making a Star Wars film that's even more of a multiplex-filling Hollywood widget than his first. It's a product through and through, and no amount of ""voices of Jedi past"" and unimaginative guest-shots (the original stars showing up for two strictly limited purposes: fan service and inter-generational pep talks) can disguise the new trilogy's critical lack of a unifying vision. The big thematic takeaway from the new trilogy and thus the saga itself? You can write your own ticket. It's gonna cost you, and even more if it's in IMAX, but you can write your own ticket. And your own fan fiction, which is liable to be as good as, if not better than, the real thing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," The Pitch: Unlike the blip between The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi, The Rise of Skywalker leaps forward a year to find the galaxy in a climactic flux. Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) is hacking through any potential threats. Rey (Daisy Ridley) is training harder than ever. While both Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are keeping the fleeting remnants of the Resistance afloat. These are tough times for anyone outside the First Order, and they’re only getting tougher as there’s a familiar disturbance in the Force — the unlikely and totally unexpected return of Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid). Never Tell Me the Odds: J.J. Abrams had no such luxury. If we’re pulling an apropos Star Wars quote for him, it should probably come from Yoda. Maybe something like “Do or do not, there is no try.” Sure, that works. Look, it cannot be overstated how unenviable a position the guy was in coming into this project. There’s the polarizing response to The Last Jedi, which essentially turned the fanbase into an ideological war zone that’s as obnoxious as it is toxic. There’s the sensationalized fatigue stemming from Disney releasing Solo: A Star Wars Story so soon after Episode VIII. There’s the death of Carrie Fisher, despite General Leia being very much alive. There’s the splintered narrative beats between what Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan put into motion and Rian Johnson carried out. And then there’s the whole conceit of concluding not one, not two, but three trilogies. “It’s the most challenging thing I’ve ever been involved in,” Abrams told Rolling Stone in their December cover story. “It’s been breakneck from the time that Kathy called me, and trying to figure out the what and the way and the how has been challenging. But you don’t want to go thinking, ‘I got this.’ Because then you’re screwed.” In other words, Abrams was out of his comfort zone for The Rise of Skywalker, and he’s all the better for it. Whereas he spent time strolling through Europe with Kasdan to figure out the story for The Force Awakens — sadly, not the rest of the goddamn trilogy — he was up against the wall here. In a way, he was no different than Lucas on the original film, forced to use his wits and tasked to find the magic that could make the whole goddamn thing work. To his credit, and to borrow a very obvious line, the Force was strong with him. Very strong. The Rise of the Skywalker finds Abrams at his most creative — and original. Seeing how The Force Awakens amounted to a reboot of A New Hope, and Johnson already had fun subverting both The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi, there was really nothing left to mine. Abrams could only drum up something new, and that’s arguably the most intriguing facet to this final chapter. Because when you look past the obvious callbacks — most notably the (admittedly) shoe-horned inclusion of Palpatine — this is exactly the kind of film fans were starving for in 2015. There are new planets we haven’t seen, new vehicles we’ve never ridden, and new arcs we’ve never seen played out. It’s imaginative in ways this trilogy hasn’t been, and for that reason, strangely feels like the beginning of a story rather than the rousing finale it actually wants to be. Even so, Abrams did his homework, and the narrative knots he’s tying here are symmetrical in astounding ways. Very little is left off the table in The Rise of Skywalker, dialing as far back to the prequels, which this trilogy had mostly been ignoring up until this point. (The fact that Abrams tasked himself to study up on The Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and The Revenge of the Sith — particularly, in the midst of all the ensuing chaos around him — should speak to his dedication.) It works, though. By leaning on that symmetry, Abrams affords himself the agency to both conjure up a new story and propel it toward a finish line. It’s a delicate dance — and often fast and a little sloppy throughout — but it’s impressive nonetheless. At the very least, it further solidifies him as a physician of pop culture, someone who can read and write prescriptions with ease. Anger Leads to Hate: In all likelihood, those who’ve been rallying around Johnson and his audacious chapter will foam at the mouth over Abrams and his more fan-friendly endeavor. (It also doesn’t help that both filmmakers have been mildly passive aggressive in recent interviews.) This is unfortunate because there’s an argument to be had that The Rise of the Skywalker actually makes The Last Jedi  stronger. Sincerely. Whereas Johnson chewed on themes of independence (and tossed shade to the military industrial complex), Abrams is far more invested in the idea of teamwork. This goes back to his original vision for this trilogy, which he summed up to Time back in 2015: “This is a story of disparate orphans who discover each other, and who discover that they can trust each other.” Naturally, he doubles down on that sentiment in The Rise of Skywalker. Here’s the thing, though: The film and the franchise are all the better for it. From the get-go, Star Wars has always been about teamwork, and how there’s strength in unity. Abrams was never wrong to chase that, and the film’s cast — specifically, Boyega, Isaac, and Ridley — actually benefit from it. The proof is right there in this film’s first act, where every character is livelier than ever. There’s depth, there’s humor, there’s chemistry, there’s — gasp! — love. Finn has something to do, and that something actually means something. Poe has a history that extends well beyond his X-wing. Rey is struggling in ways that give her character definition. It’s as if Abrams recognized the strengths he overlooked in The Force Awakens — you know, like splitting up Finn and Poe some 20 minutes into the film — and it’s telling here in the way he wields his characters with the utmost clarity. Okay, back to the big ol’ Rancor in the room: How does any of this support Johnson’s themes and messages in The Last Jedi? Well, all throughout The Rise of Skywalker, everyone is coming to terms with who they are, and by the end, the answers are out in the open. Now, some may frown at where Abrams takes such arcs — here’s looking at you, Rey — but they all suggest that personal identity is paramount to forging any kind of unity. After all, if we can’t be true to ourselves, how can we be true to others? That’s a powerful concept, and one that wouldn’t carry much weight without the pitfalls and penances the characters endure in Johnson’s chapter. Kylo Ren, in particular, thrives from this notion. His absolution of the past, which was mildly soured by his maudlin petulance in the second final act of The Last Jedi, says a lot about the alliance between both films. Who’s Scruffy Looking? Not this movie. No doubt motivated by Johnson’s MoMa-ready portraits in The Last Jedi, Abrams steps up his game on The Rise of Skywalker. It helps that he’s dealing with easily his most ambitious production yet — both spiritually and literally — but he ably matches the sheer magnitude of his story with one sweeping shot after another. His greatest flex is on the wintry planet of Kijimi, a new setting for the franchise that finds the sequel trilogy at a creative peak, at least aesthetically. How the terrain informs the subconscious duel between Rey and Kylo Ren should certainly let Johnson know he made an indelible mark on his predecessor/successor. Production wise, the setting also feels like an extended olive branch to those who read The Art of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and quickly realized they were miffed on some truly imaginative stuff. That feeling boils over by the final two acts when Rey plumbs the wreckage of the second Death Star, and later encounters Palpatine. If you’re curious, google “Channard Cenobite.” Taking One Last Look, Sir, At My Friends: Like Spielberg before him, Abrams prioritizes sentimentality. (Lest we forget he wrote Regarding Henry.) Pick any project of his and you could easily weed out how it’s worked both for and against him. So, it’s not surprising to see that The Rise of Skywalker preys upon your tear ducts and re-opens that dusty toy chest of yours to make you feel all bubbly and nostalgic inside. Sometimes it works, sometimes it’s a tad cloying, but altogether, it’s pretty earned. When you consider that this is the last ride, at least for the OGs, there’s admittedly some currency to being so treacly. Because when he does hit upon those beats — one of which may shatter your expectations — he tends to hit the mark. Much of this has to do with the evolution of these feelings. What began with “Oh my god, this is actually happening” in The Force Awakens has shifted here to “Wow, it’s all over again”, only Abrams doesn’t wear black to the proverbial funeral. Instead, there’s a sun-kissed tinge to these precious goodbyes, and since some of it is literal (as is the case with Fisher), you kind of appreciate the Hallmarkian approach. Again, not all of it lands, but when it does, the blanket’s warm. What About Lando? Absolutely beautiful. He truly belongs among the clouds. Billy Dee Williams slides right back under the cape as the smooth-talking General, and his few scenes are more affecting than just remedial fan service. The Verdict: The Rise of Skywalker was never going to be perfect, and neither was this sequel trilogy. If you recall, the reboot of this galaxy started with screenwriter Michael Arndt getting canned. That alone should have clued you into the asteroid field that would later hit Josh Trank, Chris Lord, Phil Miller, and, yeah, let’s toss in Gareth Edwards for good measure. Despite these hiccups, though, the franchise itself has been what it’s always set out to be: a trip. Because if we’re being completely fair, none of the Star Wars films under the Disney banner have been outright bad. They all have their share of warts, true, but they’ve all hit the right buttons to varying degrees of success. The Rise of Skywalker is no exception. It’s a breakneck conclusion to what’s been a breakneck restart. Think about it: In only half a decade, the Mouse House has delivered nearly as many films as Lucas did in the 28 years he piloted the ship himself. That’s not only maddening, but part and parcel why this sequel trilogy has been riddled with errors. There’s been zero patience and hardly any long-term planning, which is ultimately why Abrams is tasked to juggle so many tasks in this self-imposed 25th hour. Given that context, The Rise of Skywalker is a monumental feat for the veteran filmmaker, whose impossible trench run should be seen as a remarkable save by Disney.",POSITIVE
