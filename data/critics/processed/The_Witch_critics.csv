"Sep 10, 2021"," Given the massive societal, cultural and philosophical upheaval we’ve been pinballing around in over the past few weeks, it stands to reason that the dynamics of what we do for fun have shifted — a lot. First and foremost is staying alive. Once that is addressed, then comes the question of keeping the mind engaged and stimulated. Understand that I am completely aware of the horrifying inequality that has deepened the lines of stratification in our society — some people don’t have homes at all (which is staggering considering the amount of housing sitting empty throughout the city), and countless people are put in an economic position of having to struggle to stay alive. It’s a giant fucked-up casserole of inequality and privilege, and I address this because it’s irresponsible of me not to.  But if you are (hopefully, ideally) in a space where you are isolated (by yourself, with your spouse/significant other/polycule, or with your family), and you need to just grab a little joy for a few hours here and there, you’ve got film options. I’m going to focus on video-on-demand titles at the moment, though we’ll be getting into all the streaming services over the time we spend hunkered down. The big news out of the scared-shitless movie industry is that Universal Pictures decided to put several of its current theatrical titles onto VOD services March 20. So if you missed The Invisible Man, The Hunt or Emma, you can shell out $20 and view them in the comfort of your own home. You’ve also got Little Women, VHYes and the singular experience of Cats (which has already gone from first-run fiasco to midnight movie resurrection before it even hit home video) as options as well, as far as recent big-ticket titles go. Two of the biggest titles from last year’s Nashville Film festival — Swallow and Scream, Queen! My Nightmare on Elm Street — are also out there as well, waiting in your cable box or preferred VOD service. So you can always make your Jellicle choice and catch up with any of those. Tragically slept-on during its post-Halloween 2019 theatrical run, Mike Flanagan’s sequel to The Shining surfaced on home-video platforms with a three-hour director’s cut, one that is essential for anyone who dug the first version or who digs epic horror. The longer running time allows for a more measured pace, and several narrative elisions from the theatrical version are restored, making the end result a more satisfying take on a film that was already pretty good. It also does that thing like Dreamcatcher, where it commits full-tilt to the Stephen Kingisms that define his work but don’t always fly cinematically. You will want to try on your witchiest hat after this. A South Korean sci-fi/action/horror/gore epic that delivers all the cathartic mayhem you could want. If you’ve burned through Netflix’s I Am Not Okay With This, then this is a good follow-up for you. It’s got spectacular gore, a totally charming best-friend character (Go Min-si’s Myung-hee is just precious) and a major set piece at a nationwide talent show. Director Park Hoon-jung and lead actress Kim Da-mi lay the groundwork for something imaginative, violent, and stuffed to the gills with palpable crunch. One of the true mavericks of ’60s and ’70s American indie cinema, Al Adamson was a cheapskate visionary who made 32 films across all genres, always chasing what the crowds wanted. And sadly, he got his most mainstream fame due to the horrifying circumstances of his death. If you wanted a true crime-aesthetic take on that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood vibe, this is the one for you. The lovable freaks at Severin Films are distributing this, along with restorations of 31 of Adamson’s films. (I am psyched for Horror of the Blood Monsters like you wouldn’t believe.) Glenn Danzig’s now-infamous directorial debut is every bit as jaw-dropping as you might imagine. Verotika is a trio of “edgy” horror tales packed with as many breasts and plot points of sexual concern as it is nonconsensual face surgery, sacrificial virgins (Elizabeth Báthory archetype? Check!) and endless shots of plastic bodies dripping with blood. Is it good? Oh God no. Does it have more confusing nudity than any other English-language movie you’ll see this year? Sure does. Did you ever wonder if a man-spider has more human or arachnid sexual imperatives? Maybe you did; Verotika sure does. But is it the kind of bonding experience that a shared viewing with friends across the internet could transform into something magical? Maybe. If Cats can emerge as a tool for bringing folks together, then it’s worth a try. Warning: Do not play drinking games with the porny French accents, because it will kill you. And then there’s Bacurau. A surprise hit at October’s Nashville Film Festival and one of my favorites at the New York Film Festival, Bacurau is now available to the public via the new Kino Marquee program from distributors Kino Lorber and several domestic independent theaters (including the Belcourt). It’s a way to stream the film while supporting the filmmakers and your local indie theaters (Knoxville folk, Central Cinema is taking part as well), and there is no movie more relevant right now. When it first hit festivals, Bacurau was a lightning bolt right into the middle of the anxiety over Brazil’s Bolsonaro regime, and with the burning of the Amazon rainforest and ensuing COVID-19 horrors, it hasn’t lost a bit of its visceral immediacy. Equal parts Sergio Leone, Alyce Wittenstein and John Carpenter, Bacurau is the story of a matriarchal village versus consumptive globalism, and it is a sexy, violent, righteously furious shout from the heart. If you need some catharsis, you will get heaps of it.",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2020","Plenty bloody and brutal and un-freaking-hinged, and full of twists and shifts, the work done earlier gives the rampaging chaos more a more emotional oomph than simply watching cannon fodder villains get dismantled in vicious, gory fashion.",NEGATIVE
"Jun 19, 2020"," While the coronavirus pandemic has smashed the brakes on Marvel and Warner Bros.’s summer blockbuster slate this year, the next great superhero movie is already here, streaming on Netflix: The Witch Part 1: The Subversion.  Look past that melodramatic, even confusing name; this is not a sequel to the 2016 horror movie The Witch. Possibly there’s some nuance lost in translating it over to English from its native Korean (the movie debuted in Korea in 2018). From its brutal and electrifying fight scenes to its icy and gritty feel and its core mystery, The Witch Part 1 is a much more exciting, unforgettable watch than its generic title may suggest. On the surface, director Park Hoon-jung is telling a Superman-adjacent story: A very special kid, thanks to deadly circumstances, becomes an orphan and grows up trying to fit into a world that can’t even begin to understand them. It takes an extraordinary circumstance, usually a big evil thing, to get a character like this to find themselves and their true potential. That happens in this movie, too.  But the beauty of The Witch is the dark and sublimely satisfying place Park takes us to, once we realize our hero’s true motivation: survival.  The Witch, at its core, is a coming-of-age story about a young girl named Ja-yoon. We first meet her as a child, running away from trouble. What appears to be a black-ops arm of the government is hunting her down for reasons unknown and murders everyone in their way. Bloodied and bruised, Ja-yoon flees to a nearby farm where, in a twist of good fortune, a farmer and his elderly wife take her in and evade the dark forces that want her dead.  Flash forward 10 years later, and Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi) and her family are living unbothered by any evil government agents. The family’s problems are instead depressingly mortal. Ja-yoon’s adoptive father’s farm isn’t doing so well, and her mother is flashing signs of dementia. They’re short on cash. Ja-yoon feels stuck, not being old enough or skilled enough to help her family in the way they need most. At the same time, she is also having some very mysterious splitting headaches.  Her best friend Myung-hee (Ko Min-shi) has an antidote — for her family’s financial problems, not the headaches — which is that Ja-yoon enter a national, televised talent competition not unlike American Idol or The Voice. While Ja-yoon isn’t old enough for a full-time job, she has the voice and appeal to become a pop star, get famous and hopefully provide her family with the money it needs.  The script gets in a few jabs at the not-so-secret workings of Korean pop stardom and the facile business of churning out music acts. But Park is more focused on showing us Ja-yoon’s greenness in endeavors like this one. She approaches everything with wide-eyed optimism, and doesn’t yet have the toughness or savvy to know what to do should she win the competition. She doesn’t even realize that the black-ops team that’s hunting her down could be watching the TV show, too.  On their girls’ trip to Seoul for a show taping, Ja-yoon and Myung-hee meet Gong-ja (Choi Woo-Shik), a boy with pop star looks who says he knows Ja-yoon. He seems a little too mysterious, a little too familiar, a little too stylish to not be connected to the well-funded team that’s hunting her down.  But Ja-yoon has her eyes on the competition. If she wins, she can help her ailing mom, her struggling dad, and maybe solve her own health problems. That is, until the bottom falls out.  Ja-yoon’s shot at stardom quickly seems to be a fatal error. The boy she meets, Gong-ja, is actually in cahoots with one Professor Baek (Cho Min-soon), the icy head of the government program that’s still hunting Ja-yoon down. Her appearance on the show sets off a series of disasters which end up with Ja-yoon trading her freedom for her parents’ safety. At the same time, we get a flash of Ja-yoon’s powers which seem to be super strength, agility, and marksmanship — she takes down a team of goons in her home before Gong-ja, who also has powers, and his gang shows up.  They take Ja-yoon to Baek’s secret facility, where Baek explains that they’ve been searching for her for a very long time. Ja-yoon, like Gong-ja, was part of a government program that tinkered with kids’ brains, altering them so those kids would eventually become violent superhumans. It also turns out that the headaches Ja-yoon experiences are actually a symptom of a bigger, deadly side effect of those experiments, Baek tells her, before giving her a cure that staves off death for one month. And now, with the cure as blackmail, she’s under their control.  Ja-yoon was the most lethal superhuman created by the program, and she made it so stupidly easy for them to find her, Baek says. But then we all slowly realize that this was Ja-yoon’s plan all along.  It turns out she knew about the cause of her headaches and her terminal symptoms long ago, and that, with her lack of resources, she’d never be able to find Baek and her clandestine organization on her own. Playing a young, innocent girl who had no idea about her powers was going to chum the waters and bring Baek, and her cure, out of hiding. Everything we think we know about Ja-yoon gets turned on its head. She played us like she played Baek.  The twist hinges on Kim’s devastating performance. She plays Ja-yoon with the exact amount of earnestness and sweetness needed for us to believe that she’s just a young girl in a world that threatens to swallow her up. She never leans too far into these traits that the character becomes saccharine or even overwhelming; in an instant, when Kim sharpens her face and coils her brows, that girl we think we know is gone, replaced with a woman finally able to wield her immense power.  Park doesn’t allow Ja-yoon to be a saint, clearly painting her as a sociopath instead. She finds glee in the bloody pain she inflicts and the insults she throws. Ja-yoon tells one of Gong-ja’s goons to witness her greatness as Ja-yoon holds her face in her hands, like a lion toying with its dinner. Yet watching Ja-yoon break bones, crack limbs, and shoot up Baek’s henchmen is beautiful, cathartic even. Because they fell under the spell of underestimating the witch — and maybe I did, too.

"Apr 12, 2020"," Home › Recommendation › Films To Watch › “The Witch: Subversion” balances multiple genres within a singular narrative to keep audiences on the edge of their seat. There’s an elegance and simplicity to writer/director Hoon-jung Park’s The Witch: Subversion that all begins with the opening. Via photo montage with intense tonal scoring, The Witch sets up a mysterious cabal performing medical experiments on children: iron lungs, tubes hooked to a variety of places, bandages of such quantity to imply great injury. From here, the audience is shown the aftermath of an incident leaving several injured and one on the run as staff hunt. We do not know what happened or who is missing, we only know that who ran off, doesn’t have long to live. The mystery in place, Park then shifts away from the illusive event to jump in time as a family struggles under financial strain and medical uncertainty. While these seem like aspects divorced from each other narratively and tonally, Park masterfully weaves each into and out of each other until the audience is on the edge of their seat for a ride filled with countless surprises. One fateful morning in a rural area outside Seoul, a young girl is found unconscious and bleeding by a farmer and his wife. They don’t know from where she came, only that she endured a great deal to reach their property. Adopting her as their own, the girl who would be known as Ja-yoon (newcomer Kim Da-Mi) moves beyond her past, becoming just like any other high school student her age. However, things begin to change for Ja-yoon after she tries out for a televised competition in hopes of winning the prize money to help her struggling adoptive parents, abruptly changing her quiet life into one of violence. There is one gift, albeit hidden within: the answer to her lost past. If I’ve said it once about a film’s marketing, I’ve likely said it a million times: the trailer marketing Subversion sets up the absolutely wrong impression. As usual, the link is available at the end of the review for you to see for yourself, but take heed that it will lead you astray when it comes to what to expect. The trailer promises action and a bit of science fiction, both of which are fantastically executed, but that’s not the whole picture and there’s certainly none of the supernatural/horror promised. A great deal of it is shrouded in mystery, making the larger portion of the film more of a family drama which exists within a larger story involving a mysterious organization and people with abilities. But then, explaining Subversion without giving away the goods in a trailer is exceeding difficult. The best way to describe the film (if such comparisons are required) is to consider an amalgamation of two other Well Go USA films: Burning and The Villainess. Both are thrillers, but Burning requires the audience to dig deeply into the subtext to answer questions and Villainess puts a premium on inventive action sequences. The recent John Wick: Chapter 3 even drew inspiration from a key sequence involving a motorcycle chase from Villainess. While the stunt work isn’t on that level and the narrative doesn’t explore the social class divide, Park’s Subversion succeeds through its soft touch blending the action, drama, and/or fantasy elements which comprise the two reference works. So let’s breakdown Subversion into a few key pieces to better understand what’s all at play. The narrative element featured within the trailer is that of action/fantasy. These elements don’t make up a significant portion of the film, yet they are a cornerstone. At the onset, Park establishes that he’s going to be bending reality via the photomontage and the minimal coverage of the incident. Here, an initially unnamed scientist, played by Jo Min-soo, hints that whatever a group of soldiers are fighting can only be killed via a shot to the head and whomever escaped will be dead soon. This sets up the mystery/thriller elements that will propel much of the story forward, while also establishing that the rules of this story are vastly different from reality. When Park shows the audience that the missing subject is a young girl, we know we’re in for something different. Children in film, by and large, represent unknown potential as well as innocence. Park knows that the audience will consider these factors, making the various twists and turns of Subversion all the more delicious. To explain more would ruin some of the fun; however, suffice it to say that Park knows what his audiences expects and gives it to them in an unexpected manner. Another key element is the use of fantasy. Everything that happens is grounded in a way that is tangential to reality. History is full of various experiments conducted on patients willing, unwilling, or unsuspecting, so this element being at the forefront of the story positions the audience to accept some weirdness. This, of course, comes in the form of various metahuman abilities like speed, strength, endurance, and other surprises. Where other filmmakers might make the presence of these abilities a focus, Park uses them sparingly at first, allowing the audience to question and consider what the characters do instead of distracting them with spectacle. This places focus on the characters — their actions, their motivations, their needs — rather than on their powers, which are mighty on their own. Park trusts the audience to put pieces together even without answers, though those do come, but only as a means of kicking off a rather stellar climax. The end result is a slow cooker experience in which the audience is piece-mealed information until it reaches a paradoxical ending that’s both surprising and absolutely seeded throughout the film. The last key element to be explored without dipping into spoilers is the cast. Fans of both Train to Busan and four-time Oscar winner Parasite will recognize Choi Woo-Shik as an unnamed male character who leads in the hunt for Ja-yoon. He channels the youthful energy of Busan’s Yong-guk and the guile of Ki Woo into something charmingly menacing. With a smile, Woo-Shik pulls you in, and with a line delivery, chills you to the bone or causes an unexpected giggle. Though not the center of the film, his presence makes a strong impression on the overall experience. Revealed to be a doctor leading the project Ja-yoon escaped, Min-Soo balances the cool menace required for a leader-type with a subtle maternal nature. From the performance, the audience believes the character’s surprise and admiration upon finding out that Ja-yoon is alive. There’s a layered sense that the doctor does possess a modicum of fondness of the children under her care. This does not placate the audience into believing the doctor is benevolent, merely human in forming an attachment. It’s also a lovely detail that highlights how Park understands the inherent biases the audience will bring to his story. Again, to expound further would ruin the fun, so let’s now look at the center of the story: Da-Mi’s performance as Ja-yoon. With only a television credit prior to this, Da-Mi is essentially new to acting, yet she offers something so nuanced and complex that she appears as a seasoned pro. The character is stuck between a traumatic past, a painful present, and a violent force ramming the two together. This requires a delicate performance to capture Ja-yoon’s innocence in the face of new threats, yet a resilience to handle it. Park’s script sets the stage for a clever narrative, but without Da-Mi’s ability to invoke awe and surprise from the audience, the core of the film is lost. The one downside that requires mentioning is that the home release of Subversion is basically barren when it comes to special features. It offers no behind the scenes peeks, no featurettes, nothing of any substance exploring the film, the cast, or the crew. Considering the film is listed on IMDB as “Part 1,” there’s certainly a sense that Park has more story to tell, so why not explore some of that with a featurette. Instead, all that is included is three trailers (two International and one U.S.) and previews for other Well Go USA releases. While that is an enormous disappointment, given the strength of the film, it’s certainly no reason not to pick it up for yourself. The Witch: Subversion may possess elements you’ve seen before and it may not be the horror/action story the trailer indicates, but it’s more than worth the two-hour+ investment you’ll make. Besides the unusual special effects, what makes this film special is the effort to make the audience care about the central character, and the skill in transforming this character from a simple country girl to a supremely powerful killer of her tormenters.  It’s as if, in the first Terminator movie, the Linda Hamilton character becomes the Terminator herself.  There are a zillion technically proficient superhero/supervillian action movies, but few which do as good a job as this one does to make the victim someone to care about.  The plot twists are also very well disguised. Newcomer Kim Da Mi does an amazing job portraying her dual role perfectly.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2020","The biggest strengths in The Witch: Subversion's corner are its action, its cast, and its writer/director. There's frankly not enough action, but what's there is incredible.",POSITIVE
"Jun 23, 2019"," Highly presumptuous English title aside (the Korean one just uses the first two words), ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" isn't the blatant sequel bait you're likely expecting. The movie's storytelling tradition is actually surprisingly out of date. We've got Ja-yoon (played by Kim Da-mi), who is obviously a witch, but does not seem to realize that she's a witch. Then we have to spend ninety minutes watching Ja-yoon pretend like she's not a witch before someone finally pops up to explain her backstory. Oh yeah, that storytelling tradition I mentioned? That was back when movies were usually only ninety minutes long. They were concise and got to the point relatively quickly, which is why I spent most of the middle portion of ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" very impatiently waiting for the plot to actually get started. It's not until the halfway point that we get to see some witches murder an architect and up until then all we get are some extremely cryptic conversations. They're pretty pointless conversations too. I counted at least four different factions fighting each other in the final setpiece, but could only tell you the actual goal of one of them. Somehow, the villains never get around to talking about what they're trying to accomplish and why they're messing around with witches in the first place. Every other part of the backstory is gone over in excruciating detail except for motivation, which is by far the most interesting one. But let's get back to that final setpiece. Did I mention that Park Hoon-jung directed this? Because ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" is the kind of movie that looks so crazy cool that you really are left wondering who came up with that brilliant visual design. Hilariously, ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" doesn't even have very much witchcraft. The main thing the witches do with their powers is use them to gunfight more efficiently. Also, acting like a creepy psychopath appears to be another important inborn trait. The slow fade into smoke, the weirdly slurred English, and just body language in general really sells the witches as being an otherworldly presence whose existence in our world is unwanted and uninvited. The contrast with Ja-yoon's normal friends and family, all country bumpkins, is especially great. This creates the atmosphere of how no one knows what they're getting into with all this witch stuff. Consequently, the tonal shift in the final setpiece is jarring in the best possible way, building up an amazingly tense climax. While ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" has an absolutely pitch-perfect final half-hour, I'm still somewhat miffed about all the pacing issues up until that point. Honestly? Depending on how impressed you are by the big twist, that might not be so much of a dealbreaker. There's the local flavor, there's the sympathy we as an audience have with Ja-yoon as a person, and then there's the promise of mind-bendingly awesome hand-to-hand combat once an actual fight breaks out. ""The Witch : Part 1. The Subversion"" succeeds admirably at those fundamentals. Staff writer. Has been writing articles for HanCinema since 2012, having lived in South Korea from 2011 to 2021.

"Jun 3, 2019"," In recent times, Asia cinema has taken the western world by storm with the likes of Train to Busan and One Cut of the Dead (hailing from Korea and Japan respectively) subverting all expectations with general audiences – and it looks like that trend will continue with the highly underrated and utterly captivating The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion from Park Hoon-jung. After writing the screenplay for the horror thriller I Saw the Devil, Park turned his attention to directing and with this film, being billed as Part 1 of a series of films, has most certainly created something truly special. After a young girl escapes from a research facility fearing for her life, a loving couple finds her and take her in and raise her as their own. 10 years later, Ja-yoon (played by the sensational newcomer Kim Da-mi) has suppressed the memories of her past and has lived a normal life until one day, figures from her troubled childhood, including a devilishly handsome young man (Choi Woo-shik, Train to Busan, Okja) begin to interfere and her world is turned on its head as her true power is revealed. This first instalment of The Witch trilogy (not to be confused with Robert Eggers folk-horror The VVitch from 2015) is not your traditional mystery thriller. As is the case with Asian cinema, this film showcases their insane powerhouse of storytelling abilities as the first half is a slow-burner but also manages to feel wonderfully paced before the second half takes full hold and the audience is thrust into a brutal bloodbath and a world of the supernatural to devastatingly entertaining effect. Along with its masterful storytelling, the film also looks gorgeous – scenes at night are bathed in a beautiful blue glow which evoke feelings of the unknown and potential danger whereas moments of hope and triumph including during the day are light, fresh and crisp. These colours are used to great effect during key moments of the narrative when new information comes to light (which we as an audience learn as Ja-yoon uncovers her past) or when our lead characters are presented with a terrifying danger. Kim Da-mi’s lead performance is nothing short of spectacular. Her depiction of innocence and tranquillity before transforming into a powerful and sinister presence shows that this young actress has the ability that truly transcends her years. Backed up by the witty and charming Choi Woo-shik who, like Kim, has bags of potential going forward in his career; the film’s outlandish concept is kept grounded and focused by our lead actors. The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion is a true surprise hit and is unlike anything you’ve seen before – beautiful, heartfelt and gorgeous before turning on a coin and becoming the action sensation of the year that could rival any superhero movie with choreography that is out of this world – think John Wick meets The Raid meets X-Men. A blood-soaked rollercoaster ride from start to finish that leaves the audience gagging for Part 2 as soon as possible and has given birth to a star performer in Kim Da-mi.",POSITIVE
"Apr 14, 2019"," A little girl flees a research facility in fear of her life in this action thriller from South Korea, which, like its imperilled heroine, is full of surprises. Taken in by a kindly couple who adopt her, the girl forgets her traumatic formative years, until an appearance on a national talent show alerts her pursuers to her presence. There are shades of David Cronenberg's A History of Violence to Park Hoon-Jung's film, which, as the title suggests, is only the beginning of the story of the mysterious and gifted Ja-yoon. The slow-burn suspense of the film's first half is turned on its head in the second hour, which explodes into supernatural violence and out-there revelations. All of this would feel contrived if it wasn't so compelling, helped in no part by Kim Da-mi's transformative performance in the lead. With a carrot-dangling coda that anticipates further twists in the tale, this promises to be the start of an exciting, bloody and outlandish series.",POSITIVE
"Mar 7, 2019"," The first thing to say about The Witch is that it’s not actually about a witch. And the second thing to say is that it’s a hell of a lot of fun. Written and directed by Park Hoon-jung (the writer of I Saw The Devil), the film opens with a young girl escaping a remote science facility where there’s been a horrific massacre. She finds shelter at a farmhouse and is taken in by the kindly owners (Choi Jung-woo and Oh Min-hee), who raise her as their own. Ten years later, Ja-yoon (relative newcomer Kim Da-mi) has no memory of her younger life and has become a smart, over-achieving high school student, who’s worried about mother’s recent diagnosis with Alzheimer’s, as well as the financial toll that running the farm is taking on her father. Seeing a way out, she enters a TV singing contest, at the insistence of her best friend Myung-hee (Ko Min-shi). However, her TV appearance brings several shadowy figures out of the woodwork, including a mysterious boy her own age (Choi Woo-shik, from Okja) who seems to know her, the chilling Professor Baek (Cho Min-soon) and her trigger-happy right-hand man Mr. Choi (Park Hee-soon), both of whom orchestrated the massacre at the facility. As the memories of her past life begin to resurface, Ja-yoon will have to use everything she has to survive. The twists and turns of the plot are very much key to the pleasures of The Witch: Part 1, so it would be churlish to reveal more, but suffice it to say that after an extremely enjoyable hour or so spent in the company of Ja-yoon and Myung-hee (Ja-yoon’s choice of song for the talent contest is just one of several highlights), the film suddenly becomes a kick-ass sci-fi action flick, with a satisfying gore factor to boot. To that end, Park Hoon-jung orchestrates some deliriously entertaining action sequences that are heightened by some terrific effects work as characters get slammed through walls or hurl doors at each other. In addition, Park Hoon-jung has an impeccable sense of timing and knows just when to spring his surprises – the first action sequence is beautifully staged and executed and is sure to elicit applause in cinema screens. The performances are yet another of the film’s delights. Kim Da-mi delivers a star-making turn as Ja-yoon and is utterly convincing both as a frightened schoolgirl and the more confident figure she becomes later on. In that sense, the film puts an inspired twist on standard coming-of-age ideas and the result is ridiculously entertaining. The supporting cast are equally good. Go Min-si is hilarious as Myung-hee and effortlessly steals every scene she’s in, while Choi Woo-shik manages to be simultaneously cool and menacing at the same time. He also manages to make suddenly speaking in English seem like the most sinister thing in the world. On top of that, Cho Min-soon and Park Hee-soon make colourful antagonists and there’s strong support from K-pop star Da-eun as Gong-ja’s ass-kicking female counterpart. The plot is ridiculously busy (there’s a whole sub-plot involving Ja-yoon’s crippling headaches), but Park Hoon-jung keeps things moving at a decent pace, even if that falters a little whenever some exposition is called for – one scene in particular drags it out for so long that you start to wonder if it’s meant to be a joke. However, that’s a minor quibble that in no way detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film. The Witch: Part 1 – The Subversion screened at the Glasgow Film Theatre on Saturday 2nd March, as part of Arrow Video FrightFest Glasgow 2019.",POSITIVE
"Mar 4, 2019"," It begins with a desperate chase through the woods: two small children fleeing a sinister institution, pursued by armed guards. The boy gets caught and returned to captivity. The girl, Ja-yoon, disappears. Subsequently found by a a bereaved elderly couple - the kind of people who rescue lost children in fairy tales - she lives quietly for ten years until her appearance on a talent show brings her back to the attention of some very dangerous people. Let's get one thing clear from the start, there is absolutely nothing in this story that hasn't been done before, whether in films or video games. Two things make it interesting despite this, Hoon-jung Park's direction and Da-mi Kim's performance in the central role. Park proved himself a capable director of action with 2015's The Tiger and he approaches this film with the same confidence. Again, key parts of the story are set in a rural environment and there he does a good job of setting up dramatic framing yet establishing domestic spaces that feel old, familiar, long-inhabited. It's a good mix for this kind of material, or at least for what it pretends to be before another of its many twists. Though seasoned viewers will see these twists coming, Kim deftly shifts the tone of her performance along with them to keep us guessing. How many layers are there to this mysterious girl? Does she remember her past or can she come to do so? Are the strange skills she exhibits inborn or taught, and is she really aware of herself using them? The film's strongest scenes are those in which she interacts with her best friend Myung-Hee (Go Min-Si), capturing the blend of awkwardness, sweetness and obnoxiousness common in girls that age and leaving us emotionally unprepared for what comes next. It's a bold move juxtaposing these painfully realistic scenes with others depicting teenage assassins in the hyper-stylish, cool and ruthless mode we have come to expect from Korean fantasy cinema, forcing the viewer to reconcile the two. With the first half of the film focused on drama, the subtle placement of clues and the gradual building of tension, the second half really delivers on what many viewers will have been waiting for, with some beautifully choreographed fight scenes and action set pieces as our heroine works her way through a series of minions and end-of-level bosses. Young-Ho Kim and Teo Lee's cinematography does a good job of looking realistic yet illuminating every detail. Following their subdued approach in the first half, this contributes to the impression that Ja-yoon is undergoing a transformation as much physical as psychological. Many viewers will inevitably feel frustrated by the film because it is so derivative but there's a lot to admire in it. One just hopes that if Park returns to the story (there is, as yet, no confirmation of a Witch: Part 2), he'll take it in a fresh direction. This level of talent deserves that.",POSITIVE
"Mar 2, 2019"," The story goes that when a foundling child suddenly appeared on their farm, decent, warm-hearted Jonathan and Martha Kent adopted him as their own under the name Clark Kent and raised him with their homespun rural values before sending him out into the world. This legend casts its shadow over The Witch: Part 1 – The Subversion (Manyeo), except that the eight-year-old girl who turns up, injured and amnesiac, at the Koos’ farm has not come from a dying planet, but rather from a shadowy research facility whose walls she left plastered in the deep red of soldiers’ gore. So while, ten years later, Koo Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi) may be a mild-mannered high-school senior, loving to her cow-rearing father (Choi Jung-woo) and demented mother (Oh Mi-hee), we know that she carries within her a latent power, and we are not quite sure if she is a superheroine, or a ‘monster’ – which is how her long-term pursuer Mr Choi (Park Hee-soon) insists on referring to her in the presence of his handler Dr Baek (Jo Min-su).In the decade that she has spent with the Koos, Ja-yoon has been living a quiet life below the radar, while concealing a debilitating, possibly deadly illness from everyone – but once, on the advice of her best friend Myung-hee (Go Min-si), she has entered a national talent competition, her television appearances draw the attention of Baek, Choi and a group of menacing Korean-American teenagers, and the stage is set for her past to catch up with her. In other words, this is one of those ‘sleeper agent’ narratives, like The Long Kiss Goodnight or The Bourne Identity, in which a protagonist’s dormant powers are reawoken. The impressionistic prologue, however, with its tableau of a messy massacre’s aftermath, promises that once this young woman gets her childhood mojo back, there will be blood – and let’s not forget that writer/director Park Hoon-jung also co-wrote the screenplay to Kim Jee-woon’s serial killer thriller I Saw The Devil, which included scenes of shockingly extreme depravity. So while this film is long, and much of it plays out like an adolescent melodrama, the film’s opening ensures that even the most innocuous of scenes are taut with the tension engendered by our expectation of mayhem to come. Ja-yoon may seem sweet, good-natured and vulnerable, but we also know that she is a coiled spring, and are just waiting for all that potential energy to be released – even if we are not quite sure what power she has, or to what end she will ultimately use it. The Superman story was always, among other things, a myth of nature versus nurture, as Clark Kent, for all the alien strength in his genes, is raised by his adoptive parents with a human ethos and outlook. Park’s film is playing a similar game, while knowing full well that the rules are ripe for subversion. This requires lead actress Kim to put in a versatile performance (playing someone who is, precisely, putting in a versatile performance) – and in the end, after a very slow build-up, the film delivers an explosion of crazy, bloody violence, before setting up the sequel implied by the (English) title.",POSITIVE

"Dec 15, 2018"," When Ja-yoon (Kim Da-Mi) escaped from a top secret government facility as an eight-year-old, she left behind a trail of bodies, an ankle-deep river of blood and all of her memories of the life which came before. Ten years later, she’s living as a normal, if unusually gifted teenager in a rural backwater. But when she appears on a televised talent show, it’s not just her perfect pitch which attracts attention. And soon, Ja-yoon finds herself pursued by figures from a past she no longer recalls. This YA spin on a Korean revenge movie suffers from a few pacing issues, and leans a little too heavily on exposition, but the action sequences are as thrilling as they are face-crunchingly visceral. And the deadly charisma of the key performers, notably newcomer Kim Da-mi as the teenage Ja-yoon, should ensure plenty of interest in further chapters in this story. As the title suggests, this is the first instalment of a proposed trilogy, and it would seem that Warner Bros, Korea have a potentially lucrative property on their hands; certainly within the East Asian region. Whether it can cross over to Western audiences, however, remains to be seen. This picture shares some narrative beats with dystopian adolescent series like Maze Runner, but is frequently more interested in cleavering chunks out of its peripheral characters than it is in developing them into fully rounded support. That said the film, with its female protagonist who can combine acts of extreme violence with a demeanour of adorable cuteness, could connect with a modern arthouse audience. The film is written and directed by Park Hoon-jung, who started out as the screenwriter of films such as Kim Jee-woon’s I Saw The Devil and Ryoo Seung-wan’s The Unjust and whose directorial outings include the Korean box office success New World and the award-winning The Tiger. Park’s gung-ho approach to action sequences is given plenty of scope in this film, which bears more than a passing resemblance to Joe Wright’s Hanna. It’s a visually striking piece. The aesthetic of the second half of the picture is a kind of industrial futurism – concrete-lined bunkers feature heavily – which contrasts with the folksy simplicity of Ja-yoon’s life with her elderly adoptive parents. The brutalist corridors and clinical minimalism, graded to accentuate a cyber-blue artificiality, provides an ideal backdrop for the exuberantly gymnastic violence which is the film’s main selling point. Matching him in for lavish evil is Professor Baek (Cho Min-soon, a dual role), the genius creator and potential destroyer of Ja-Yoon and the children she grew up with for her turbulent first eight years. Baek is a twisted mother figure, who can’t conceal a swell of pride in her little monsters, even as they turn upon her.

"Aug 24, 2018"," A high school student with amnesia tries to uncover what has happened to her. All leading her into deeper troubles ultimately revealing a darkness she could not have imagined. Don’t let the blatant sequel bait-y title deceive you, this is a perfectly fine standalone film with no clear sequel in sight. This is not half a film, half a teaser, but a mesmerizing and thoroughly entertaining mix of over the top sci-fi, gory and well-choreographed fight scenes, and an inventive twist on the Korean revenge thriller with some superpowers thrown in for good measure. Park Hoon-jung, the writer-director best known for writing Kim Jee-woon’s bloody reinvigoration of serial killer tropes in I Saw the Devil and directing the violent action film V.I.P, is back to subvert expectations and delivering a fresh take on a tired genre. Park dials back the gore a bit, and instead focuses on the inner struggles of a badass character’s awakening. There are influences from Hanna, yet the plot most resembles that of the underrated Push, starring a pre-Captain America Chris Evans. The Witch: Part 1, which starts its festival run at the Fantasia film festival, opens in a hospital facility in the middle of a massacre of children, with blue-tinted neon-lights hiding some of the gruesomeness of the event, complete with flickering lights. Out of the survivors, a girl manages to get away and collapses on a nearby farm. Ten years later, the girl, Ja-yoon (newcomer Kim Da-mi) has no memory whatsoever of the experiments done to her as a child, or why she seems to have special abilities her adopted family now keeps as a secret. One day she decides to appear on a national talent show to earn the money to treat her adoptive mother’s Alzheimer’s and save the farm from economic ruin. When Ja-yoon lets her powers slip as a “special talent” to advance to the final, she is spotted by the people who tortured her as a child, who have been hunting her for years. That’s not all, she also becomes prey for a squad of similarly gifted teens, and the fight begins. Park’s signature set pieces and choreographed fight scenes are in full effect in The Witch: Part 1, and it doesn’t overwhelm the story, even if one wishes they had reached the fights a little earlier instead of spending so much time devoted to pointless conversations involving characters with cero motivation. The same applies during the explosive third act, where we see a dozen characters or so battling it out in bloody fight sequences, despite only two or three characters having clear goals. Choi Woo-shik (who plays the other child survivor) is a wholly entertaining antagonist, and he seems to be having a lot of fun in the role, even if the scenes where he speaks English sound a bit out of place. Kim Da-mi is without a doubt the film’s standout performance, as she keeps the motivations of Ja-yoon a close secret until the plot reveals a compelling and thrilling backstory that explodes in exciting action. Is she really a quiet girl, or a genius? Is she a witch? A hero? Kim adds layers of determination and innocence to her performance. The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion tries to cram a bit too much plot in its two-hour runtime and it loses itself during the middle portion of the film, as it seems to forget what its ultimate goal is. Nevertheless, the atmospheric music score, thrilling action sequences and visuals keep you interested in what comes next. One has to wonder though, if part 2 is already in production, then they could have pushed the film’s key revelations to the next one. As of now, there’s little incentive to return to this world, yet the little that we see makes for a very entertaining film.",POSITIVE
"Aug 6, 2018"," There is nothing quite like South Korean genre cinema. From the tonal mastery that sees them instantly move from pathos to pratfalls, to plots denser but far tastier than year-old fruit cake, to the sheer beauty and brutality of their action sequences, Korean filmmakers create dark magic on a regular basis while the rest of the world bathes in their glory. The Man from Nowhere, Lady Vengeance, The Chaser, Confession of Murder, I Saw the Devil, to name just a few. Last year’s most deliriously thrilling export was The Villainess, a film that pairs an elaborately convoluted story with mesmerizing fights and action set-pieces, and now 2018 has found its own kinetic masterclass from Korea. A dark and no longer sterile medical facility sees its walls turned red as adult attendees and child wards are slaughtered. Two kids escape into the surrounding woods, but while the boy is caught the girl makes it to an old couple’s farm before collapsing in silence. They take her in, and a decade later Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi) is a happy high-schooler using her charm and wits to help keep her adoptive parents farm in the black. An opportunity arrives in a televised singing contest held in a nearby city, but while Ja-yoon’s after the prize money it’s unwanted attention she finds instead. The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion is a mealy mouthful of a title, but it’s worth mumbling along with en route to one hell of an action/thriller. Writer/director Park Hoon-jung previously delivered Korean thrillers as varied as New World, The Tiger, and V.I.P., but it’s his script for Kim Jee-woon’s I Saw the Devil that he’s currently most revered for. The Witch might just change that as it teases elements of Nikita, Psychokinesis, X-Men, Hanna, and last year’s brilliant Thelma. Overly convoluted plots are typically a death knell for action movies as they slow things down and risk losing audiences, but Korean cinema has a knack for loading the screen with story turns and dramatic reveals one atop the next that elevate the fun rather than bog it down. Here we’re gifted with amnesia, secret government training, parental mysteries, competing abilities, and an amateur singing competition, and all of it swirls together into a concoction that’s both grimly dramatic and blistering fun. I’m avoiding the majority of the plot details as the genre maelstrom is best experienced first-hand, but just know that the story goes both where you expect and where you don’t. Exposition explaining it all is repetitive and overwrought at times, but happily the chaos and antics surrounding it are typically plenty distracting so as to make it forgivable. The film is a stylish joy throughout, but its two biggest strengths are its action and its lead. Fight scenes are fast and mean with sharply choreographed brawls sending characters into walls and beyond, and the conflicts range from hand to hand combat to gun play to other more specialized abilities. Park captures the sequences with an eye for detail and effect, and while most of the action is inside tight quarters it never fails to impress thanks to a combination of execution and Kim Young-ho‘s cinematography. As the only film on Kim Da-mi’s IMDB page this is one hell of a calling card, and in addition to a sequel she should probably expect more offers soon. She convinces on the action front — thanks in part to the magic of film-making — but just as importantly she offers an incredibly compelling performance as a teenager suddenly thrust into situations beyond her expectation or understanding. Her distress at her parents’ dilemma is tangible, and it’s only heightened by the arrival of assassins, hit squads, and killers. (Redundant, maybe, but there are a lot of them!)",POSITIVE
"Aug 2, 2018","The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion applies bone-crunching, blood-spurting action to the cinematic trend of super-gifted teens discovering their powers/true origins.",POSITIVE
"Jul 31, 2018"," We join director Park Hoon-jung's The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion in the middle of a massacre. The bloody corpses of children litter the ground in what appears to be a medical facility/prison in a cleansing at the behest of a female overseer and her male subordinate. However, there are a couple of kids that just won't go down easily, and they are, of course, the most important of them all. One, a young boy, is retrieved, but the other, a young girl, takes off into the woods and escapes to a remote country house where she is adopted by an elderly couple and raised as their own. Ten years pass, and young Koo Ja-yoon (Kim Da-mi) built a new life as an average kid, seemingly harboring no memories of her violent past. However, when she decides to audition for a Korean star search show and accidentally live broadcasts some rather usual abilities to the country, her former captors find her and come after her. So begins a very intricate tale of violence and revenge that bears all the hallmarks of the best of Korean revenge thrillers, with a few newish tricks thrown in. Westerners will probably know Park Hoon-jung best as the writer of Kim Jee-woon's controversial serial killer thriller, I Saw the Devil, however, that's just one of a number of films with Park's unique stamp on the poetry of violence. He also wrote and directed Choi Min-sik's 2015's The Tiger, and 2013's incredible gangster film, The New World. This newest project sees Park adding science fiction to his already impressive resume, and the results are awesome.  Existing somewhere at the intersection of the Bourne films and X-Men, The Witch is an intense experience that introduces some interesting new characters to the lexicon of Korean action cinema. Koo Ya-joon not only has some telekinetic abilities, but also fights like a demon, and when faced with other like herself, we get a delightful explosion of ultra-violence that leaves screen the soaked in blood and littered with broken bones. Koreans are no strangers to on screen violence, but I don't think I've seen it expressed in quite this way before, and it's exciting. Imagine an R-rated, grittier X-Men, and you'll get the idea. Only this time, the writing and acting are top notch. The cinematography by Kim Young-ho and Lee Teo is amazing, and really sells the top notch action choreography once the film makes its dramatic switch from witch hunt to action movie. The music and sound design also play a huge part in setting the tone. We're punched in the chest by a pounding, propulsive score by Mowg, and the sound design of the action sequences really allows the audience to take the punches with Koo. Kim Da-mi's performance in the lead is effective and creepy. She's asked to transform from a timid school girl to a raving maniac, hell-bent on vengeance, and handles both ends of the emotional spectrum very effectively. Kim also manages the action well, though I feel like most of that was done by teh camera, since so much of it is exaggerated FX. Her antagonists, Professor Baek (Cho Min-soon) and the bitter security guard Mr. Choi (Park Hee-soon), provide convincing menace and give Kim something solid to bounce off of. There is a best friend character, Myung-hee (Ko Min-shi) whose presence seems wholly unnecessary, but it's a small thing in the larger scheme, and mostly forgivable. At two hours and five minutes, The Witch isn't particularly long for this flavor of Korean action film, but given that it's set up as the first part of a story, it does feel as though they could've trimmed a bit from the set up. It takes its sweet time getting in motion, but when it does, The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion - a bit of an unwieldy title, if you ask me - is a hell of a lot of fun and will both satisfy Korean action fans looking for something different, and leave them desperate for more.",POSITIVE
"Jun 28, 2018"," What do you get when you mix a classic Bond villain and some crackpot science into a Korean revenge thriller? You get The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion, an often mesmerizing, occasionally kooky but thoroughly entertaining thriller from Park Hoon-jung. The writer-director probably still best known for penning Kim Jee-woon’s bloody, torture orgy I Saw the Devil reels in the gore here (don’t worry, it’s not totally banished) in order to focus more squarely on the central character’s badass awakening. Park has help in the form of influences ranging from Kick-Ass to Hanna and maybe The Man from Nowhere, and even though he relies on a hoary plot device that is well past its best-by date (we use 100% of our brains, full stop), the concoction he’s come up with is just original enough to earn a place in the Korean crime-revenge-thriller canon. Warner’s most recent foray into the local market following Kim Jee-woon’s box office hit The Age of Shadows and debuting director Lee Zoo-young’s under-the-radar critical hit A Single Rider would appear to have all the necessary elements for a strong summer showing at home, and a berth at the Fantasia International Film Festival in Montreal in July is likely to kick-start a long, healthy festival run for The Witch overseas. Markets across Asia should be more than welcoming of a polished, franchise-style actioner headlined by a girl from the neighborhood. The Witch opens in a hospital facility with a wholesale massacre of (grab your pearls) children at the behest of steely Professor Baek (Cho Min-soon, star of Kim Ki-duk’s divisive Pieta). The slaughter unfolds in blue-tinged, neo-noir light, complete with flickering bulbs and slick floors, before the action heads outside where one of just two survivors, a little boy, has been caught by Baek’s right hand, Mr. Choi (Park Hee-soon, doing his best to channel Lee Byung-hun). A girl gets away and collapses on a nearby farm, whose elderly owners, the Koos (Choi Jung-woo and Oh Min-hee), promptly take her in and get her patched up. Ten years later, the girl, Ja-yoon (relative newcomer Kim Da-mi), is a clever young woman who has her small community—and her adoptive parents—wrapped around her finger. Her only problems seem to be a lack of funds to run the farm with, and a mother suffering from Alzheimer’s. A quick fix appears in the form of a reality competition show that Ja-yoon’s bestie Myung-hee (Ko Min-shi) is sure she can win. On the trip to Seoul for the performance, Ja-yoon meets Gong-ja (Choi Woo-shik, Okja), who claims to know her, insisting they have a connection. He eventually leaves her be, but reports his findings to Baek, whose lackeys have been looking for Ja-yoon for a decade. The other is Choi. Saying more about the occasionally overly-complex story would spoil it, but it is safe to say that given its title and the opening images of witchcraft lore dating from the Middle Ages to wartime human experimentation, The Witch isn’t actually a witch movie, and the title is more metaphoric. That minor quibble (for some) aside, Park’s signature acrobatic and/or creative fights (choreographed by martial arts directors Park Jung-ryul and Kim Jung-min) and set pieces (another greenhouse, industrial-chic concrete hallways) are always in service to the story, never overwhelming it, and that kicks it up a notch at the end of the second act. Kim plays Ja-yoon close to the chest—Is she a psychopath? A mutant? A superhero?—in a nicely modulated performance as a young woman coming into her own and realizing her own power. She steers clear of bratty and precocious center of attention tics too often hoisted on female characters, and layers Ja-yoon with fear, gratitude, resignation and determination as required. Park’s timing couldn’t be better. By Korean action standards The Witch: Part 1. The Subversion is lean at two hours, but in cramming so much into the narrative it stumbles over itself on more than one occasion; it very often forgets its own internal logic and drags the final showdown out to the breaking point. The sequence’s style, energy and Kim’s coiled glee save it from tipping into overkill. Park has a good eye for visuals and great DPs in Kim Young-ho (Park’s V.I.P., Haeundae) and Lee Teo, yet falls into a “tell” instead of “show” trap for character and narrative momentum; Baek would give Auric Goldfinger a run for his verbose money. If a second part is in the pipeline, as the title suggests, there was no need to rush key revelations. Mowg’s pounding, atmospheric score stands out among impeccable tech specs across the board.",POSITIVE
