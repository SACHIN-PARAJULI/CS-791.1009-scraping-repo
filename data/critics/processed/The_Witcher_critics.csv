"Mar 5, 2022"," In advance of the second season of The Witcher, Netflix serves up an animated spin-off set before the fall of Kaer Morhen, the mountain stronghold of the Witchers’ Guild. But The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf isn’t your typical prequel. This fantasy drama sends an early signal that this installment isn’t interested in fitting season one into a more recognizable (linear) framework by centering Vesemir, a previously unknown character from The Witcher-verse.  Beau DeMayo’s script uses the now familiar monster-of-the-week narrative device to dive into centuries old events on the Continent, further deepening the history and scope of this fantasy world.  If you thought Henry Cavill’s Geralt - and that season one prophecy - were the only characters or events of note; rest assured The Witcher-verse has an embarrassment of riches just waiting to be mined. Think of The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf as a novella.  This a slim story arc revolves around Vesemir (Theo James), a roguish witcher with a taste for the high life and little interest in selflessness. Following his journey offers insight into the varied dangers lurking on the Continent, as well as details on the different factions in the kingdom. There are slow-burning resentments aplenty and pettiness abounds. But have no fear, under Kwang Il Han's direction, this is one adventurous side quest viewers will definitely want to accept.  Because Vesemir is a very talented witcher which means things absolutely get bloody.  Set in the kingdom of Kaedwen, Vesemir plies his trade with flare, witty quips, and recklessness matched only by his mastery of swordplay and magespells. With Theo James (Castlevania) bringing Vesemir to life with warmth, edge, and just the right amount of disdain this witcher makes for a most excellent anti-hero. There are witchers aplenty in this day and age and no two are the same.  From the outset, Han drops the audience directly into the mix. Vesemir, ever the opportunist, jumps into the fray to defeat a monster lurking in the forest attacking travelers. It’s an exhilarating and action-fueled opening. It's also a fantastic introduction to the sophisticated anime-influenced style that Studio MIR’s swiftly becoming known for (Dota: Dragon's Blood, Legend of Korra, The Boondocks). There’s beauty and depth to the imagery that when coupled with the twists and tragically romantic turns in the storyline builds into a bold hyper-realistic drama.  After a snark-ladened battle, Vesemir riffles through the pockets of the dead gathering his fee. Lucky for him, these were gentry and his take sees him soon soaking in a hot bath, eating and drinking well. Too bad for the surviving son, Vesemir has little interest in saving the recently orphaned.  Although it must be said, he got more than a touch of assholishness blended in with the charisma. Making his chapter a great way to showcase why that resentment against witchers in Geralt's time is a) not entirely unfounded but b) still deeply rooted prejudice and political gamesmanship. Thankfully, as with all good anti-heroes, there’s more to Vesemir than meets the eye. Young Vesemir’s (David Errigo Jr.) sly, witty, and hungry to escape the limited life of a bond servant. As he and his closest friend pull off a caper in the market, it’s not hard to see why as an adult, a previously impoverished child would a) be a boozing hedonist and b) tell a recently orphaned rich kid to essentially suck it up and deal.  Although it’s slightly jarring when the narrative pace slows for this extended flashback to Vesemir's childhood ; don’t worry the plot isn’t deconstructed like the live-action series. The point of this time-slip is immediately apparent. A chance encounter between a unscrupulous witcher named Deglan (Graham McTavish) and young Vesemir changes the course of his entire life. It’s a dangerous profession. Not for the meek or mild; definitely the kind of the unwanted and forgotten easily find themselves sacrificed to fill the ranks. Unlike most recruits, however, Vesemir volunteers to undergo the trials and transformation into a witcher. It's also where you'll find yourself wanting to smack him up side the head for not asking nearly enough questions about the people he's thrown his lot in with. The first of many times.  While Vesemire’s focused on securing his next bag, there's a battle waging at court over the continued relevance and role of witchers. More than a few witchers' ply their trade in disreputable ways as monsters become less plentiful to battle. It adds
layer of bitterness to the fear fermenting among the populace. Some, like a certain sorceress (Lara Pulver) with the King’s ear, lobby fiercely for the destruction of their stronghold Kaer Morhen and eradication of witchers for all time. Tasked with uncovering the origins of a monster, in order to save witchers from a death decree, Vesimer sets off to prove that despite their reputation, witchers weren’t responsible for resent attacks.  There’s a commentary on class and hierarchy built into any fantasy world with a feudal system. Thankfully Han lets the overtones (and drags) seamlessly blended into this storyline do all the heavy lifting. Juxtaposing young Vesemir’s choices to the cynical adult he becomes against what drives him to undertake a quest on behalf of a certain lady (Mary McDonnell) speaks volumes about what it takes to survive in this world. He may be a scoundrel but Vesemir's got a code.  So when he comes face-to-face with not only the consequences of his disinterest it leads to a reckoning and a third act that so fully capitalizes on the flexibility of animation its bring this story to an epic climax. Every emotional bet gets a payoff in the midst of the betrayal, fierce action sequences and magical battles. And while this chapter comes to a somewhat sad if satisfying end. Han’s craftily left the door open for returning the dangerous Vesemir. It’s a rather brilliant way to world-build and create connections without promising the undeliverable.  The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a striking 81 minute character study wrapped in mayhem and magic. Like all good animated stories, it uses bright colors, fluid movement and excellent scoring to showcase its worldbuilding and a cast of characters with quirks and unexpected complexity. It's sure to keep viewers on their toes. So, while fans will still have to wait until that December 17 premiere of The Witcher’s second eight episode season to learn more about the series’ primary storyline, the ripple effects from what befalls Vesemir continue straight through to present day and Geralt, stoic monster-hunter-for-hire.  Ro is a Rotten Tomatoes approved film/tv critic, writer and host on several of the MTR Network's podcasts.

"Sep 21, 2021"," Vesenir calls himself a ""churlish knave,"" and the Witchers in general are primarily motivated by money and the good times to be had in taverns while bragging of their exploits. Some scenes include graphic violence, blood, gore. A tentacle impales a character through the head, emerging out of the mouth. Limbs cut off. Demonic imagery. Dead bodies. Head stomped during battle. Eyes dangling out of sockets. Decapitation by sword. Fighting with swords, punches, kicks. Kids who are training to become Witchers are treated poorly, left in mangers even during cold weather, with very little food, often beaten and verbally abused by their trainers. Stabbings. Demonic possession. A servant boy is bullied. Brief male nudity (buttocks). Brief female nudity (breasts) during demonic possession (nonsexual). An openly gay Witcher makes reference to ""limp pr--ked man whores."" Talk of foreplay. Based on a book series, the product is marketed in a variety of ways -- everything from role-playing games to clothing to action figures, among other things. Parents need to know that the book series-based The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a 2021 animated fantasy in which a cocky monster slayer must learn to fight for reasons greater than money and glory. Expect blood and gore during many of the fighting scenes, including tentacles impaling heads, chopped-off limbs, decapitation by sword, eyeballs dangling out of sockets. We see dead bodies of humans and elves. Kids training to be Witchers are physically and verbally abused by their trainers, forced to sleep in mangers overnight during cold weather. Some profanity, including ""f--k."" Brief male and female nudity. One of the Witchers is openly gay, but also uses phrases like ""limp pr--ked man-whore."" Talk of foreplay. Pipe smoking and wine drinking. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In THE WITCHER: NIGHTMARE OF THE WOLF, Vesimir (Theo James) is a servant boy who dreams of escape while he's bullied by his superiors. He finds his chance after a chance encounter with a Witcher named Deglan (Graham McTavish), who cures the lady of the house in which Vesimir works of her demonic possession, and provides Vesimir with a chance for a better life. However, that better life entails difficult and abusive training, training that the other young kids Vesimir trains with despise, as they are only there because they've been forced out by their impoverished parents or taken. Years later, Vesimir is now far beyond his hardscrabble origins, and is a ""churlish knave"" who drinks in taverns and boasts of his battles. But when a mysterious monster begins attacking the kingdom, Witchers are the ones being blamed by the elves and some of the humans of the kingdom, and Lady Verbst does her best to keep the increasingly-wary king from turning on the Witchers. As these attacks grow, a massive battle ensues, and Vesimir must confront the demons of his past, and learn that there's more to being a Witcher than coin and glory. This movie is as much a character study as an introduction to a fantasy universe. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf seems to exist as a way to tide the superfans of the Netflix show over until Season 2 begins, and to also introduce a new/old character into that world. In this movie, we get the backstory of Vesimir, who had trained the character Geralt on the show. The overarching themes of the movie are moral ambiguity and reckoning with one's past, and the story can be enjoyed on its own terms for those unfamiliar with this universe. Striking the right balance between providing both an in for newbies and something enjoyable for those already immersed in this world is no easy task, as so many similar attempts to do so in the assorted fantasy and superhero ""universes"" will attest. It works as a character study, as we see Vesimir's development from being a ""churlish knave"" to someone whose inner life and past is so much more complicated than that devil-may-care persona he presents in the tavern over several goblets of wine. The violence, however, does come across as excessive at times, and doesn't really add anything to the story except gory images of eyes dangling from sockets and the like. It's not always easy to know (or care) the differences between your Mages and your Leshens and the assorted flora and fauna that populate this world. Still, it's a good entry point into this world if you haven't seen any episodes of the show, as it tells a story from that world without spoiling anything from the show. Families can talk about the graphic violence in The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf. Was it necessary to the story, or did it seem excessive? Why? What would the challenges in creating a movie from a ""universe"" that is well-known by some, and unknown by others?

"Sep 9, 2021"," Steve Martin and Martin Short will get the oldies in, and Selena Gomez will appeal to a younger generation as this cannily contrived and distinctly adult murder-mystery gets quickly into its stride. The scene: An expensive Manhattan apartment building. The players: Charles-Haden Savage (Martin), a retired actor famous for playing a police detective; Oliver Putnam (Short), a washed-up Broadway director quietly raging against the dying of his career; and Mabel Mora (Gomez), a young woman who claims to be renovating an apartment for her aunt. The twist: the three of them are all fans of the same true-crime podcast, so when a neighbour turns up dead – and the police immediately rule the case a suicide – they decide to launch their own investigation and serialise it in that popular podcast format. Oh, and the stiff? That would be Tim Kono (Julian Cihi), a young man who police figure shot himself, even though he’d just bought what appears to be an expensive engagement ring. It’s quickly clear that Gomez isn’t just there to drag in a younger audience demographics – she’s at least a co-equal lead, and her mysterious character is the one with the connection linking our amateur sleuths to the deceased. And with Gomez being a seasoned actor and producer on top of being an honest-to-goodness pop star, she delivers an engaging, multi-faceted performance and comfortably holds her own on screen with Martin and Short. It helps that she gets such a great wardrobe to play with – that combination of saffron jumpsuit and old-school paratrooper boots is a real winner. It probably didn’t hurt either that the first two episodes are directed by Jamie Babbit (But I’m a Cheerleader, Silicon Valley), who is as adept with drama as she is with satire, and who serves as an executive producer alongside Gomez and series creators Martin and John Hoffman (Grace and Frankie, Looking). It goes without saying that Martin and Short are both adorable and wickedly funny – and as long-time real-life friends they’re completely in tune with each other’s comedic sensibilities and timing. Here their characters are chalk and cheese, but cut from the same cloth – they’re pretending that they have their ducks in a row while trying to distract from all the paddling underneath the water. The gags come in a range of shapes and sizes, one of the most exquisite involving Martin’s character and a little concertina. Great fun. “I don’t usually greet the space at my house,” says Marie Kondo, banging a tuning fork on a crystal and waving it around her head. In this case, though, she is concerned that having a whole TV production crew clomping through her living room “might scare my house”. Is the celebrated Japanese tidying-up expert fully off with the pixies? Opinions will vary, though Kondo herself explains that “in the Japanese way of thinking we believe that every object has a soul or life energy that flows through it”. How does that square with chucking out loads of old stuff? Simple: you say goodbye to it with gratitude. And we already know how to do that, say with a cherished concert T-shirt that wound up being more holes than shirt. Now, though, Kondo wants her tidying-up projects to go much further in repairing lives and relationships. As this new series begins in California, it’s an immediate success. Not only does she transform the workspace of father-and-son nurserymen Jimmy and Logan; she draws the whole family closer. There are also plenty of practical tips for us at home. Magic. It’s hard to nail these white-collar criminals, isn’t it? It’s been five years since US attorney Chuck Rhoades (Paul Giamatti) set out to bring down hedge-fund boss Bobby Axelrod (Damian Lewis), and as this new batch of episodes drops it’s Rhoades who’s on the back foot once more. The enduring brilliance of Giamatti and the goodwill that he and the likes of Lewis, Maggie Siff and David Costabile have earned elsewhere give the self-aware melodrama a watchability lacking in other series set in the soulless world of high finance. Is there a place for Western anime? This gory, grimdark prequel to Netflix’s live-action series The Witcher answers with a resounding yes. As fans of that series, the video games and the novels of Andrzej Sapkowski know, “witchers” are itinerant, alchemically enhanced bounty hunters who wander a fictional medieval realm killing grotesque and deadly monsters for coin. This imaginative, atmospheric film, stylishly directed by Kwang Il Han (The Legend of Korra) tells the origin story of Vesimir, mentor of series protagonist Geralt of Rivia. Fans of Netflix’s Tiger King will be all over this disturbing feature-length documentary in which retired cop turned animal advocate Tim Harrison exposes the squalid world of big-cat breeding and trafficking in the US. This is no quickie cash-in – it’s the product of a three-year investigation by Harrison and filmmaker Michael Webber, and some big names who’ve spent many years taking big-cat cubs on the US talk-show circuit look pretty bad. A lot of those cubs didn’t come from real zoos or sanctuaries – much less end up in them. The world is ready for a mash-up of Succession and Survivor in which the awful offspring of the awful rich are forced to compete to the death for the fortune of a dying patriarch played by horror legend David Cronenberg. Add to that a masked slasher running around gutting or dismembering whichever ones he – or she – can get their hands on, and you have quite a vicious piece of work. This impressive season of Aaron Martin’s anthology series pays as much attention to character development as it does to the horror.",POSITIVE
"Sep 4, 2021"," Han Kwang-Il knows what fans want. Audiences watch “The Witcher” because we want to see our hero go on a colorful quest, perhaps while fighting monsters, not for the dreary goings-ons of medieval life. Yet, the 2019 series “The Witcher” was heavy on the goings-ons, with only one bright spot in the entire show: Henry Cavill’s blonde wig. Kwang knows where that show went wrong, and offers a spectacle drenched in action, adventure, apologue and atmosphere. You might even find yourself having…fun. When we last ventured through the Continent, the empire was so desaturated you could be color blind and not miss a thing. Which is why some fans took issue with Lauren Schmidt‘s show. The novels were full of life and verve, elves, witches, and witch hunters, so one has to wonder why “The Witcher” drowned out that color with lifeless hues, trading lively characters for sad, groaning men. These witch hunters didn’t need a mission. They needed a vacation. The screenplay by Beau DeMayo, who also worked on the show, follows the basic outline of the monster-of-the-week structure employed by “The Witcher,” just with a whole lot more vibrancy packed into it. Vesemir, a witcher (i.e. a witch hunter for hire), is tasked with tracking down a creature in the woods bordering the Continent somewhere on the outskirts of Kaedwen. In the process, he comes across a “leshen,” a shape-shifting witch that dices up townspeople like carrots and gobbles up their remains like a lion after a week of fasting. Vesemir brings a sense of humor to their battle, throwing shade at the monster as he jumps from tree to tree in order to catch the beast off-guard. He cuts off the leshen’s arms, but it still manages to slip away. Meanwhile, a handful of characters wander the Continent. Tetra (Lara Pulver) tries to convince the court that witchers are dangerous and should be exiled, while an old friend of Vesemir’s, Lady Zerbst (Mary McDonnell), argues in his favor. Accompanying her is Deglan (Graham McTavish), who recruits witchers to protect the land from outside forces. Also along for the ride are a couple of trainees, including Geralt, the main-character in “The Witcher,” and Luka (Matt Yang King), Vesemir’s best friend/drinking buddy. Vesemir’s mission brings all these individuals together, in a “Game of Thrones”-style climax that trades dragons for witches. This new “Witcher” is obviously a step up from the show in terms of visuals and atmosphere, but it also feels like a bigger film in character, and, indeed, characters. Kwang, who made his reputation with Adult Swim’s “The Boondocks,” three episodes of which he directed, can certainly flesh out his characters in more ways than one. While there’s no shortage of throat-slashing, there’s also a good 30 minutes devoted to backstory, developing the players in such a way that, by the time “Nightmare of the Wolf” reaches its operatic conclusion, the emotional payoffs feel earned and honest.",POSITIVE
"Sep 2, 2021"," The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is an action-packed ride that delivers on its premise, but loses sight of some of the franchise's nuanced themes.  The Path has been long for the filmmakers and audience alike, but the long-awaited tie-in to Netflix's The Witcher series has finally arrived. Written by Beau DeMayo, The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf promised a never-before-told story focused on Vesemir, the oldest living witcher at Kaer Morhen. Overall, the anime film delivers on its unique premise.   Andrzej Sapkowski's novels introduced Vesemir in Blood of Elves and CD Projekt Red's video games brought an end to his story in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. While plenty across the franchise have come to see Vesemir the way Geralt of Rivia and his brethren do, the old wolf's story has only ever been hinted at and never really explored. Nightmare of the Wolf, a violent, monster-filled anime adventure, captures the brutality and pain of, not just Vesemir's life, but the witcher profession. It has its minor flaws, but Netflix's anime tie-in film constructs a fitting tale for the School of the Wolf itself and is a must-see for any fan of The Witcher franchise.   Nightmare of the Wolf introduces a younger Vesemir, charmingly voiced by Theo James. He's a highly skilled witcher who initially only cares about killing monsters and receiving coin. That changes when his fight with what appears to be a new kind of leshen gains the attention of Tetra, a sorceress in the court of King Dagread of Kaedwen, who, driven by a belief that witchers are by nature deceptive and dangerous, attempts to turn against the residents of Kaer Morhen. Vesemir soon finds himself embroiled in a mystery involving magic, missing elven children, and new monsters -- the conclusion of which will decide the School of the Wolf's fate.   While Vesemir's past is new territory in the franchise, those familiar with the Continent have a lot to look forward to as well. There are a few familiar faces that turn up in the anime, lots of references to the novels -- like the chapter titles of The Last Wish sprinkled throughout -- and beautifully drawn set pieces. The film was produced by Studio Mir, best known for its work on Legend of Korra and Voltron: Legendary Defender. The hallmarks of the studio are all there in Nightmare of the Wolf's art style and in the execution of its thrilling action sequences.   Unlike most of Studio Mir's previous works, the action scenes in The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf are especially violent. Blood spews and limbs fly in ways that evoke the Castlevania series. At times, it can be excessive; but, given the presence of vicious monsters, it is occasionally necessary to capture the sheer savagery that witchers are trained to fight. It also works well with Nightmare of the Wolf's fairly accurate depiction of the witcher's fighting style. Fans of Sapkowski's novels will know that the witchers -- of Geralt, at least -- employ a dance-like style consisting of constant pirouettes to avoid attacks until ready to execute a precise strike. That is very much how Studio Mir brings Vesemir fighting style to life.   The Witcher has never really been about killing monsters. One of the most prominent themes throughout the novels and, by extension, the franchise, has always been the fallacy of good and evil. Netflix adheres to that theme in Nightmare of the Wolf well, and it results in a fair number of scenes where audiences will have trouble deciding who to root for. Just like many of the characters in the novels, the characters that populate the anime film are not good or evil in any obvious way, which is something longtime franchise fans will certainly appreciate.   That being said, The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf brings plenty of new material to the table. It uses its unexplored setting to tell a deeper story about the School of the Wolf -- including Tetra, Vesemir's childhood friend, Illyana, and Deglan, the witcher that led him to Kaer Morhen. Deglan was created for the show and isn't mentioned in Sapkowski's novels. Even so, he fits right in with the lifestyle and world of Kaer Morhen's past. He's not exactly a likable character, but he's not supposed to be. None of the characters are. He's just a representation of everything Kaer Morhen was in Vesemir's youth, and all the cruelty, moral ambiguity, and necessity that came with it. His complexity, coupled with Graham McTavish's memorable vocal performance ensures that Deglan will be a welcome addition to the world.   Nightmare of the Wolf has a lot in store for both longtime fans of the books and video games, as well as audiences who are just now experiencing The Witcher for the first time. Screenwriter and producer Beau DeMayo previously teased that his intention was to ""give fans that are familiar with the series a totally unique experience that I hope makes them feel like they're coming to 'The Witcher' for the first time again."" It is fair to say that he, director Kwang Il Han, and executive producer Lauren Hissrich, have succeeded in doing that.   More importantly, they justified the need for an anime tie-in film. This isn't just a story about Vesemir, who audiences will see in Season 2 of Netflix's The Witcher. This is a story about Kaer Morhen and the ruins of the mountain fortress will mean that much more to those keeping up, thanks to Nightmare of the Wolf.

"Sep 1, 2021"," While niche anime streaming services such as Crunchyroll and Funimation primarily rely on their robust back catalogs of classic and obscure animation to attract viewers, Netflix has embraced a different approach, one built predominantly around new, original content. (They’ve also gobbled up exclusive distribution deals for series that have never premiered outside of Japan.) Slowly but surely, the streaming giant has built a slate of well-regarded anime series that cover a variety of styles and genres, including Aggretsuko (2018-), Devilman Crybaby (2018), Carole & Tuesday (2019), and Kengan Ashura (2019). American and South Korean studios that produce anime-style animation have also been getting in on the venture, with series such as Voltron: Legendary Defender (2016-2018), Blood of Zeus (2020-) and Dota: Dragon’s Blood (2021-). Netflix’s latest project with South Korea’s Studio Mir – which produced Voltron and Dota and animated the bulk of Nickelodeon’s The Legend of Korra (2012-14) – lies at the confluence of the streaming service’s anime offerings and its live-action fantasy programming. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a one-off animated feature film, but it also serves as a prequel to Netflix’s sword-and-sorcery series, The Witcher (2019-). This makes Nightmare an odd beast, in terms of its intended audience. The film is clearly designed to attract the same viewers that made The Witcher one of Netflix’s buzzy success stories, but it also fits comfortably within the original anime programming block that the company has established. Indeed, it is perhaps not coincidental that Nightmare of the Wolf bears a passing resemblance to the Netflix anime series that is most visible to casual American viewers, Castlevania (2017-21): Both are dark fantasy-action stories characterized by their horror elements and ultra-violent tone. For established fans of The Witcher, this new animated film is not exactly essential, but it should provide a gratifying dip into the series’ world as they wait for the premiere of the second season in December. Although the film is set decades prior to the live-action show – and therefore focuses on previously unseen characters – it does flesh out the series’ mythology quite splendidly. It also dramatizes a crucial historical event that will be familiar to devotees of Andrzej Sapkowski’s original novels and CD Projeckt Red’s acclaimed Witcher video-game series. Where other viewers are concerned, the obvious question is whether Nightmare of the Wolf functions well as a standalone serving of anime-flavored medieval fantasy. In terms of stylish animation, clever storytelling, and gruesome fantasy violence, the film certainly delivers, although it never does much to distinguish itself from Netflix’s numerous offerings in the same vein. Familiarity with the lore of The Witcher is not strictly necessary to follow Nightmare of the Wolf, as the film swiftly establishes the basics. The witchers are a guild of monster hunters, mercenaries who roam a vast and nameless medieval continent, slaying creatures of legend in exchange for coin. Unlike the ageless sorcerers that skulk behind the thrones of this world’s petty kingdoms, witchers are not born but made: The young boys recruited by the order are subjected to horrifying alchemical mutations that grant them long lifespans, heightened senses, and rudimentary magic abilities. Nightmare of the Wolf is centered on a cocky witcher named Vesemir (Theo James), a figure who will one day serve as mentor to the live-action series’ protagonist, Geralt. In the film’s opening scenes, Vesemir slays a predatory forest spirit that has slaughtered a traveling noble family. Clues from the scene lead Vesemir to suspect that another party was controlling the creature – and possibly other monsters in the region that have been exhibiting unusual and aggressive behavior. At the court of the local monarch, sorceress Tetra Gilcrest (Lara Pulver) is keen on blaming the witchers themselves for this recent spate of attacks, while the noblewoman Lady Zerbst (Mary McDonnell) argues for prudence and demands more evidence. While the king hems and haws, Vesemir is visited by an old elven ally, Filavandrel (Tom Canton), who has his suspicions about the creature that the witcher slew but also has his own interests to protect. Eventually, Vesemir is obliged to pair up with the disdainful Tetra to hunt down the mastermind who has been bedeviling the kingdom with this small army of mutated monsters. Nightmare of the Wolf is a typical animated fantasy-action feature in most respects, stitching together high-octane anime action set-pieces with sequences of sleuthing, politicking, and pensive characterization. Beau DeMayo’s screenplay draws out what is essentially a 55-minute adventure to feature length by splicing in two lengthy flashbacks to Vesemir’s childhood. The rationale for this somewhat awkward structure eventually becomes clear – setting up a genuinely satisfying reveal – but the effect is nonetheless a little jarring. These flashbacks touch on young Vesemir’s (David Errigo Jr.) nascent romance with his friend Illyana (Jennifer Hale), his tutelage under the rough-edged, hard-drinking witcher Deglan (Graham McTavish), and his early days at Kaer Morhen, the castle stronghold of the witcher faction known as the School of the Wolf. The more intimate, character-centered quality to the flashbacks unfortunately means that it’s easy to forget about the present-day monster-investigation plot, creating some dissonance when the film snaps back to it after a 10-minute digression. That said, director Kwang Il Han – a seasoned storyboard artist and animation director, here helming his first feature film – keeps the proceedings relatively brisk, lucid, and focused.  The first season of Lauren Schmidt Hissrich’s live-action series was a bit wobbly in its early episodes as it struggled to find a consistent, distinctive tone and establish itself as something other than Netflix’s Game of Thrones also-ran. In contrast, Kwang’s film knows exactly what it’s about, serving up plenty of gory, exaggerated witcher-on-monster action and embellishing it with the sort of wild acrobatics and over-the-top pyrotechnics that don’t really work in a live-action context. Like Hissrich’s series, Nightmare of the Wolf makes an effort to capture something of the witchers’ balletic swordplay technique, which Sapkowski describes so vividly in his novels and which proves a terrific fit for anime-style animation. Kwang also employs montage shrewdly and imaginatively, most memorably in a sequence where a bittersweet letter from Illyana is read aloud over wordless shots of young Vesemir’s brutal initiation rites at Kaer Morhen. Nightmare of the Wolf leads directly into The Witcher’s upcoming season – in which an aged Vesimir plays a crucial role – but the film’s modest success as a dark fantasy tale doesn’t really depend on the live-action series. Viewers who are already enamored with Sapkowski’s Slavic-flavored, Tolkienesque setting will probably appreciate this stylized interpretation of the world, but everything that Kwang’s feature does well, it does well on its own. The roguish, swaggering Vesemir is a shallow but charming character, and his secret heartache for the quiet life he might have had with Illyana proves to be a surprisingly poignant emotional foundation for what is, in essence, a hyper-violent cartoon. Like Castlevania, the film depicts both monster- and human-wrought violence in a manner that is grisly and shocking, underlining that life is cheap and death can be sudden. For seasoned fans of adult-oriented anime, it will be familiar territory, but if the prospect of watching screaming children being torn apart by giant mutant cockroaches gives you pause, consider this your content warning.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2021"," The Witcher: Nightmare Of The Wolf takes place decades before the events of The Witcher and follows the story of Vesemir (Theo James) the Witcher who trained Geralt of Rivia when he was just a wee lad. (Vesemir is being played by Kim Bodnia from Killing Eve in the live-action Witcher’s second season, so you can see a great deal of time has passed). Even if you’re not into anime, you should absolutely watch Nightmare of the Wolf if you care at all about the story of the Witchers. The events of the movie will play directly into the show’s second season, not just because of Vesemir but because of the Witcher fortress of Kaer Morhen, which will be one of the more important locations in the coming season. Nightmare of the Wolf is partly Vesemir’s origin story and partly the story of the fall of Kaer Morhen and the near-eradication of the Witchers themselves at the hands of the powerful sorceress, Tetra Gilcrest (Lara Pulver). Tetra has her reasons to despise Witchers, though I won’t spoil those here. Suffice to say, she’s made it her lifelong quest to rid Kaedwin of the Witcher menace. She accuses them of dishonesty and defrauding the people and the crown, of creating the very monsters they then hunt down and various other crimes. She’s opposed in this by Lady Zerbst (Mary McDonnell) a noble widow and adviser to the king, who supports the Witchers. To say that these women do not see eye to eye would be a massive understatement. One thing leads to another and a final battle at Kaer Morhen finally takes place that’s quite riveting. Along the way we meet a mutant elf, plenty of terrifying monsters and the elf king Filavandrel (Tom Canton) who we’d met previously in Season 1 of The Witcher (he captured Geralt and Jaskier after which Jaskier penned his catchy Toss A Coin To Your Witcher tune). We also meet Vesemir’s tutor and master, Deglan (Graham McTavish). Deglan is a bold and fearsome leader with some dark secrets and a rather precarious relationship with morality. Ultimately we discover that his own hubris is as much to blame for the Witchers’ downfall as Tetra’s ruthlessness. You never know if a spinoff like this will be a cash-grab or lose the tone and feel of the series by adopting such a different medium. Altered Carbon: Resleeved, the anime Altered Carbon spinoff, was bad enough to make me worry about this one. Same with the Dragon’s Dogma anime. Then again, Castlevania is a terrific Netflix anime based on a video game series, so it really is hit-or-miss. Fortunately, Nightmare of the Wolf is well worth your time. The cast is outstanding, the story is at once action-packed and moving. Vesemir is such a strikingly different Witcher than Geralt and it’s fascinating to see how he became a mutant and just how awful and dangerous that process is (perhaps even more awful and dangerous than becoming a sorceress). The movie adds layers to the Witcher universe, giving us important backstory and more of the fun politicking and intrigue that makes this series so compelling. There’s also a lot of terrific action and magic, the kind of stuff that costs a lot in a live-action but can be done relatively easily in an animated film. You won’t see Henry Cavill doing back-flips and jumping twenty feet into the air, but Vesemir isn’t constrained by such paltry matters as physics—if only the games had such riveting combat! I honestly have no complaints. The film is never boring, never poorly written or acted, and runs a most welcome hour and 23 minutes. Movies are too long these days, but not this one. I suppose if I had to complain about anything it would simply be that the animation style is so different from the show, and it might have been nice to dial down the anime aspects to make it feel just a bit more in line with the show and games. But honestly once I was watching I hardly noticed or thought about it. If the art style turns you off, I still think you should watch this one regardless. Follow me on Twitter and Facebook.

"Aug 27, 2021"," If like me you couldn’t get into “The Witcher” live-action series due to it not being in chronological order, then “The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf” is the perfect way to get into the action pack fantasy world.  In the movie, the world of “The Witcher” expands in this anime origin story. Before Geralt (played by Henry Cavill in the live-action series), there was his mentor Vesemir (Theo James), as a swashbuckling young witcher who escaped a life of poverty to slay monsters for coins.  However, when a strange new monster begins terrorising a politically fraught kingdom, Vesemir finds himself on a frightening adventure that forces him to confront the demons of his past.  “The Witcher” live-action show, an adaptation of Andrzej Sapkowski’s book series of the same name, was a difficult show for me to get into due to its non-linear storytelling style.  I gave up about three episodes in because of the sheer confusion. However, the world of “The Witcher” always intrigued me as a lover of anything fantasy-related. And while I know some people aren’t fans of anime, the medium allows for the property to go big with regards to action sequences and that overall scale of the show.  And unlike the show, this movie is mostly in chronological order with some flashbacks, but they serve a huge purpose in the end not only for our lead’s character development but  the overarching plot of the movie. The voice acting is stellar with James doing a great job as Vesemir, giving the character the proper balance between loveable arrogance and compelling hero. The animation is spectacular and they did a great job of using the medium to its fullest when it comes to the action scenes and the overall mood of the movie.  It is the prequel we needed to give a bit more depth to the world we were introduced to in the live-action series and also help those – like me – who fell off along the way.",POSITIVE
"Aug 27, 2021"," Until Henry Cavill returns for another season of the live action fantasy series about mercenary monster hunters with supernatural powers in December, here is the animated prequel currently showing on Netflix. Some may be disappointed that there are no familiar characters, but this does explore the lore and is an entertaining look at Vesemir, the witcher who trained Cavill's character Geralt. This side of his character is put across brilliantly by Theo James from the Divergent films, who gives a voice acting masterclass in bringing Vesemir to life.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 27, 2021"," The latest in the line of Netflix “original Anime” that aren’t actually anime (serious guys, the only distinction in the country its created in, there’s nothing wrong with creating a more adult oriented animation and it being technically a cartoon…) The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf serves as a prequel to the Netflix live action series and focuses on the backstory of Geralt’s teacher Vesemir, who is set to debut in Season 2, and the downfall of the Witchers. A good premise then, did they pull it off? Vesemir, a cocky young Witcher, delights in slaying monsters for coin. When a dangerous new power rises on the Continent, Vesemir learns that some Witchering jobs are about more than just money. This leads to a large scale battle at Kaer Morhen that results in the Witchers being decimated, the mage and method of creation lost and Vesemir accidentally killing a childhood friend (who was now an old woman, that’s Witcher aging for you!) He ends up rescuing a small group of just-converted Witcher children and decides to teach them, one of which is identified as a young Geralt. So the film has its moments but it’s also very by-the-numbers, and I wasn’t thrilled with the character designs, even if the actual animation was well done. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf has some great moments and interesting backstory but it’s also very plain, full of generic characters and has scenes with over-the-top violence for the sake of it. Not a bad way to spend an hour and a half, but I doubt I’ll be watching it again.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 24, 2021"," By  Andrew Webster, an entertainment editor covering streaming, virtual worlds, and every single Pokémon video game. Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories. If there’s one thing that ties the many iterations of The Witcher together — whether it’s the original books, the hit games, or more recently the live-action show — it’s Geralt of Rivia. The lovably miserable monster hunter is the core of the series in a way that’s rare for fantasy, which often follows stories bigger than just one person. But that’s also what makes Nightmare of the Wolf, an anime spinoff on Netflix, so interesting. It’s a prequel that shifts back in time to focus on Geralt’s mentor Vesemir, who can feel like the polar opposite of his protege: charming, playful, and with a voracious appetite for the finer things in life. It’s a refreshing twist that also does a good job of exploring some of the mysteries at the heart of The Witcher universe, without getting away from the hallmarks of the series. Nightmare of the Wolf might not be the most welcoming starting point for the franchise, but it’s a whole lot of fun. The anime movie jumps back and forth in time, focusing on Vesemir’s life during two key points. Initially, it’s mostly about his upbringing and what led him to life as a witcher (which, for the uninitiated, are mutated monster hunters who train from a young age to kill deadly creatures for cash). Essentially, he fled a life of servitude in hopes of some respect (and money) hunting monsters, unaware of the harsh realities at Kaer Morhen, the bleak castle that serves as a training ground. These scenes show just how brutal the witcher training is and use that as way to explore the different ways people react to trauma. Witcher stories often talk about how few candidates actually survive this process, and in Nightmare of the Wolf you can see why: young boys are forced to fight seemingly impossible odds in a nightmare swamp and, if they manage to survive that, subjected to a painful alchemy meant to enhance their strength and senses. Those who make it through can be grim like Geralt, or hide their pain under a lust for life like Vesemir. The other half of the story follows Vesemir at the height of his abilities. (Witchers age slowly, so even though he’s a handsome-looking young man with a square jaw and mischievous smirk, he’s actually 70 years old.) At this point he’s renowned for his ability to slay tough monsters and is able to charge a hefty price because of it; one of the earliest scenes shows Vesemir in the bath, haggling with an elf over his fee, before deciding he’s too expensive. At the same time, though, monsters seem to be few and far between, creating a conundrum for Vesemir and his compatriots. As one witcher puts it, “we’re putting ourselves out of business with every monster we kill.” As these two periods intersect, they shine light on a very pertinent relationship: namely between the witchers and the monsters they’ve sworn to kill. I won’t spoil anything, but Nightmare of the Wolf answers some questions that have been floating around on message boards for years about the origins of both hunter and hunted. And those new answers will likely change how you think about them both. Unfortunately, these revelations might be lost on newcomers, those who aren’t already immersed in the intrigue of the Continent. The good news is that, revelations aside, Nightmare of the Wolf is still a blast to watch even if you’re coming in cold. The shift to animation means that the action is more fluid than ever, particularly when it comes to Vesemir slicing his way through beasts with an inhuman grace, all while making smart-ass quips. (The slick action shouldn’t be too surprising, as Nightmare of the Wolf was created by Studio Mir, the same team behind shows like The Legend of Korra and Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts.) Whereas combat in the live-action show and games can feel heavy and laborious, in the anime things are much faster and more dynamic, befitting Vesemir as the new lead. For Geralt, fighting seems like a chore. Vesemir has fun. That doesn’t mean the battles don’t pack a punch: Nightmare of the Wolf is incredibly violent. It’ll only be a few minutes in before you see dismembered limbs and gushing blood. Nightmare of the Wolf manages to capture much of what has made The Witcher such a hit — a dark fantasy world, political intrigue, brutal action, buff men in the bath — but it does so without spending much time setting up the world. It assumes you already care. (This is especially true when it comes to the Big Twist, which won’t mean much if you aren’t invested in the universe.) So as fun as its gory action and plentiful one-liners can be, the movie can still feel like supplementary material — something to hold you over until season 2 finally drops in December.",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2021"," While we oh-so-patiently wait for the season 2 premiere of Netflixâs hit seriesÂ The WitcherÂ (based on the video games of the same name, which in turn were based on a series of short stories by Polish novelistÂ Andrzej Sapkowski). the streaming giant dropped its latest installment in theÂ Witcher franchise:Â The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf. The anime film follows a young Vesemir as he goes through the Witcher trials and learns firsthand what it means to be a monster hunter â the filmâs spirited vocal performances and gory action will surely satisfy anyÂ WitcherÂ fan looking to learn more about this pivotal character and the history of the Witchers. Starring Theo James,Â The Witcher: Nightmare of the WolfÂ follows cocky young Witcher Vesemir (James), whose main interests are coin, wine, and more coin. When he runs afoul of a powerful witch named Tetra (Laura Pulver) Vesemir finds himself entrenched in a decades-long conspiracy to rid the world of Witchers once and for all. Along the way, he discovers dark secrets about the origin of his own kind from mentor Deglan (Graham McTavish) and reunites with old flame Lady Zerbst (Mary McDonnell). The Witcher: Nightmare of the WolfÂ is without question a film made almost exclusively for pre-existing fans ofÂ The WitcherÂ franchise, and it has no qualms about diving headfirst into the action without spending much time establishing characters or large chunks of the worldâs (sizable) lore. While a non-fan would certainly still be able to follow the narrative, the significance of the events as they relate to the mainÂ WitcherÂ series would likely be lost â names like Vesemir, Filavandrel, and yes, Geralt are frequently and casually tossed around, but without knowledge of the series or games,Â whyÂ we should care about those names isnât really explored. Instead, the film assumes the audiencesâ familiarity, and as such, focuses more on giving much-needed insight into the past of Geraltâs stony mentor: Vesemir who, as it turns out, was a rambunctious Witcher in his youth, not entirely unlike his future trainee Lambert. Though the âhero learns saving the day is more about doing good than it is about moneyâ narrative is nothing new and relatively trite, the story still works here, thanks in large part to Jamesâ spirited vocal performance. The other big draw here is the action â which keepsÂ The Witcher franchiseâs tradition of gory, brutal, no-holds-barred fight scenes and incorporates the quick, fast-paced anime fighting style, resulting in a number of visual delights and clever uses of camerawork. Tetraâs magic is also used to significant effect, providing a stark contrast to the more grounded, earthy tones of the rest of the filmâs palette. The plot itself is nothing new â mostÂ WitcherÂ fans will already be familiar with the brutality of the trials and the revelation that the majority of trainees die before their transformation is complete â but seeing the torturous acts brought to life with often haunting animation helps bring the reality of an already disturbing but intangible concept to life. The filmâs most interesting reveal â that some Witchers themselves are behind the creation of the monsters they kill â is a fascinating concept perhaps deserving of a little more screen time, but as the film stands, the hour and twenty-minute runtime is perfectly suitable for the relatively unambitious narrative being told here: a one-off quest peppered with looks into Vesemirâs history via flashback. TheÂ Witcher: Nightmare of the WolfÂ relies heavily on its audienceâs pre-established knowledge of characters and events, but assuming youâre clicking âplayâ knowing your Strigas from your Kikimoras,Â Nightmare of the WolfÂ is a gory, well-acted glimpse at Vesemirâs past.

"Aug 24, 2021"," While Nightmare of the Wolf‘s storytelling struggles to build momentum, this gorgeously animated prequel to The Witcher has a climax as tremendous as it is vicious. Actions have consequences. Or, as John Wick would put it, “everything’s got its price.” From an intimate promise to a precisely-worded declaration before a crowd, making a play sends out an echo. And that echo can be anything and everything from magnificent to apocalyptic. In the grim world of The Witcher, the apocalyptic is more likely, whether personal, national, or global. Kwang Il Han’s animated feature The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf makes this clear through splendidly choreographed action and a great heaping murder of metaphorical crows coming home to roost.Adapted from the works of author Andrzej Sapkowski, Nightmare of the Wolf is a prequel to the main Witcher stories. A generation before series protagonist Geralt of Rivia walked the continent in the pages of Sapkowski’s novels, the Lauren Schmidt Hissrich-run Netflix series, and the acclaimed video game trilogy, his mentor Vesemir (voiced in English by Theo James) was as much a roguish swashbuckler as he was a professional monster hunter. Vesemir is unique among his Witcher peers. As a youth seeking a life beyond indentured servitude, he joined the alchemically mutated monster hunters of his own free will, rather than being selected by or sold to them. The life of a Witcher is extraordinarily perilous. Even with their sense- and strength-enhancing mutations, expertly crafted weapons, and potent magics, they battle the most lethal creatures in the world for a living—to say nothing of the nightmarish process that goes into transforming a baseline human boy into a Witcher. But, provided they survive these perils, there’s money in monster hunting. As much as people may despise Witchers as mutants, their knowledge and skills make them the people to turn to when there’s a monster on the loose. And Vesemir’s damn good at monster hunting. His glyphs, swords, and potions have won him luxuries he could only dream of as a servant boy.But as much as he’d like to go from hunt to hunt and pleasure to pleasure, the world will not allow Vesemir to while away his days with hot baths and good wine. After years in decline, monsters are resurging—and mutating into new, deadly forms. Elven girls are disappearing. A powerful sorceress and politician named Tetra Gilcrest (voiced by Lara Pulver in English) leads a growing movement to drive the Witchers out of civilization. Gilcrest’s political opponent Lady Zerbst (voiced by Mary McDonnell in English) is running what interference she can, but her influence is waning. Secrets of all sorts will soon slither out of their hiding places, and Vesemir will have to face them and all that they bring with them. Nightmare of the Wolf is a relatively solid film that primarily succeeds on the strength of its extended climax. Kwang Il Han’s action direction is superb (Studio MIR, Nightmare of the Wolf‘s animators, are also known for The Legend of Korra—a program beloved for, amongst other things, its awesome fight scenes) throughout, but particularly shines here. He moves from a siege to a desperate brawl to a series of one on one confrontations, all of which dance between action and horror with style. Vesemir and his fellow Witchers are tremendous fighters, graceful and acrobatic, equally capable of delivering a clean cut or a ruthless mauling. Gilcrest’s spellcasting always has a physical element to it, whether she’s in direct combat or working at range. And the monsters, be they small or titanic, are ferocious. Vesemir is superhuman. Nightmare of the Wolf makes it clear that his enhancements are the bare minimum necessary to keep up with the monsters he hunts. Power alone isn’t enough to kill a monster. Knowledge of their weaknesses is critical, as is an ability to improvise on the fly. And sometimes? Sometimes it comes down to luck. Nightmare of the Wolf‘s climax uses its constant, impeccable action to tell a story about the ways that things come undone, the ways that injuries unreconciled and secrets unanswered can trigger calamity. Would that the rest of its storytelling was as strong. The opening act teeters awkwardly between Vesemir’s present and flashbacks detailing his youth and his first encounter with the Witcher Deglan (Graham McTavish, whose animated beard is similarly splendid to his real one), the man who will become his mentor and foil. The second act is livelier, thanks to a reluctant alliance between Vesemir and Gilcrest. James and Pulver build a compellingly sour, antagonistic chemistry for the two.But uff, the dialogue can be painfully blunt and rote. And while Nightmare of the Wolf makes a point of including characters of color in its world, its Black characters die horribly often enough that it becomes an unwelcome pattern in the picture.The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf‘s terrific last act makes the film. Its intensity and terror pull its story together into something coherent, a tale that forces Vesemir to take stock of who he is and who he needs to be and to do the work necessary for that. Getting there is a wobbly affair, but for folks who dig The Witcher, this is well worth checking out.The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is now available on Netflix. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them.

It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",POSITIVE
"Aug 24, 2021"," Fans of The Witcher, Netflix’s dark adaptation of the series of fantasy novels of the same name, still have a few months to go before the hit series returns, but the streaming service is hoping to make the wait more tolerable with the release of The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, an animated spinoff film set in the show’s universe. Produced by The Witcher showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich, Nightmare of the Wolf offers up a prequel tale set years before the events of The Witcher series. The film follows Vesemir, a monster-hunting Witcher who will become series protagonist Geralt’s mentor in later years, as he investigates a deadly creature terrorizing a city — only to make a discovery that changes the course of both his life and those of all Witchers. The Originals series writer Beau DeMayo, who previously penned one of the best episodes of The Witcher to date, season 1’s Betrayer Moon, provided the script for Nightmare of the Wolf, which manages to offer both a satisfying stand-alone adventure and one that reveals quite a bit more about the world the series inhabits. The resume of Studio Mir, the South Korean animation studio that worked on Nightmare of the Wolf, features some of the best animated projects to arrive on the small screen in recent years, from the critically acclaimed The Legend of Korra and Voltron: Legendary Defender to the criminally underappreciated Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts. With Nightmare of the Wolf, the studio pivots from all-ages adventures to a more adult-themed series while retaining its knack for blending crisp lines and vivid colors with a superb grasp of both action and emotion in the characters they bring to the screen. Nightmare of the Wolf is as rewarding to watch in its quieter, more dialogue-driven moments as it is in its most frantic, fast-paced sequences, and Studio Mir rewards Netflix’s continued collaboration with another visually stunning project that serves both the story and the diversity of the streamer’s library well. The cast of actors lending their voices to The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf offers a nice variety of familiar faces (if not names) and veteran voice actors, with The Divergent Series franchise actor Theo James portraying the adult Vesemir. James delivers Vesemir’s dialogue with the right mix of roguish charm and well-earned confidence, and the blending of his line delivery and the character’s on-screen persona works well for the character. Much of the same can be said of Sherlock actress Lara Pulver and Outlander actor Graham McTavish, who voice the sorceress Tetra and the veteran Witcher Deglan, respectively. Both characters keep you guessing when it comes to their true loyalties, and the actors voicing them do a nice job of maintaining that uncertainty in their delivery of the characters’ lines. Although the visuals and voice acting in Nightmare of the Wolf deserve plenty of praise, it’s the story that brings it all together — and also offers the most compelling reason to watch the film. Telling a satisfying, self-contained story while also adding depth to a world as rich as that of The Witcher is no easy task, and the Nightmare of the Wolf creative team balances those needs well. Newcomers shouldn’t have any trouble jumping right into the world of The Witcher via Nightmare of the Wolf, while those familiar with the series — or the books they’re based on, by novelist Andrzej Sapkowski — will likely enjoy the extra layers the film adds to the existing franchise saga. When season 2 of The Witcher finally premieres in December 2021, it will be nearly two years since the series made its debut on Netflix. Fortunately, even without actor Henry Cavill’s gruff monster hunter Geralt, Nightmare of the Wolf offers plenty of rewarding elements and a great reminder of why The Witcher is such a fascinating world to explore, no matter what form that exploration takes. It’s spooky season this month, and that means the atrocity mine is currently being plundered by content creators across America. The three-episode docuseries Conversations with a Killer: The Jeffrey Dahmer Tapes, directed by noted documentarian Joe Berlinger (Brother's Keeper, Paradise Lost), is Netflix’s second project tackling the infamous cannibal/necrophiliac/serial killer to debut in a matter of weeks. It follows Ryan Murphy’s 10-hour miniseries drama, Dahmer-Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story. This Dahmer double dose mirrors the barrage of Ted Bundy content that Netflix put out in early 2019, following up the Zac Efron-led drama Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile with the docuseries Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (also directed by Berlinger).  Amsterdam could have been forgiven for being a lot of things, but dull is not one of them. The new film from writer-director David O. Russell boasts one of the most impressive ensemble casts of the year and is photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki, one of Hollywood’s premier cinematographers. Beyond that, its kooky premise and even wackier cast of characters open the door for Amsterdam to be the kind of screwball murder mystery that O. Russell, at the very least, seems uniquely well-equipped to make. Instead, Amsterdam is a disaster of the highest order. It’s a film made up of so many disparate, incongruent parts that it becomes clear very early on in its 134-minute runtime that no one involved — O. Russell most of all — really knew what it is they were making. It is a misfire of epic proportions, a comedic conspiracy thriller that is written like a haphazard screwball comedy but paced like a meandering detective drama. Every element seems to be at odds with another, resulting in a film that is rarely funny but consistently irritating. Forests can be scary. Love can be even scarier. Combine the two and throw in a few wild twists for good measure, and you get Significant Other, a uniquely terrifying thriller about a couple whose romantic hike in the woods takes an unexpected turn when they begin to suspect they might not be alone in the wilds. Written and directed by Dan Berk and Robert Olsen, Significant Other casts Maika Monroe (It Follows) and Jake Lacy (The White Lotus) as Ruth and Harry, respectively, a young couple who head off into the forests of the Pacific Northwest for some hiking and camping. Harry intends to propose to Ruth, but the pair's adventure takes a deadly turn when they discover something sinister in the woods.

"Aug 22, 2021"," A new “anime” film from Netflix (a term they’ve thrown around with some generosity), The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf feels like confirmation of an exciting niche the streaming service has carved out in the realm of animation, mixing adult themes and genre thrills. Despite being dubbed an anime, producers Studio Mir are best known for their American animation work, having made their name with the Avatar sequel The Legend of Korra. With that series, Mir more than proved their chops for creating compelling fantasy action grounded in believable but nonetheless wondrous movement. Directed by Han Kwang-Il, the film is set in the same fictional setting as the live-action The Witcher (showrunner Lauren Schmidt serves as producer here), in turn based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski. Set before the time of Henry Cavill’s Geralt, Nightmare of the Wolf follows the youthful adventures of his senior, Vesemir, who carries himself with more authority and is always ready with a quip. Like the show, lots of mythic proper nouns being thrown around might inspire some viewers who are unfamiliar with the medieval dark fantasy world of the books, game or series to keep the captions turned on. But screenwriter Beau DeMayo does well to keep audiences orientated through (if not necessarily interested in) the different threads of intrigue, keeping things firmly based in the racial tensions between humans, elves and witchers. At the same time, we witness the tragedies and regrets of Vesemir’s past, his youthful ambition setting him on the path to freelance monster hunting. In the present day, Vesemir comes up against a mage who uses the killings of the film’s brutal opening as fodder for her fear-mongering campaign against witchers. Not that it’s completely unfounded – Han also details the horrific rites of passage that makes witchers, an inhumane series of tests that few survive. It’s all in service of fairly straightforward themes of humanity’s tendencies towards intolerance, building towards an inevitable conflict. From the jump the film is horrifically bloody. No sooner are we introduced to a family of travellers in the opening scene than they are ruthlessly torn to pieces by a transforming monster – a ‘leshen’ – lurking in the woods. It turns from horror to wondrous action as Vesemir steps in, dispatching the creature with a dynamic onslaught of swordplay and magic. Dismemberment is treated remarkably gracefully here, the characters twirling and gliding through each layout. The animators consistently find interesting angles from which to frame the spectacle, even in the first person. This extends to the more mundane moments, viewed with equal detail and expressivity. When it comes to the landscapes themselves, however, Nightmare of the Wolf is not the most exciting showcase of the geography of this world. Much of it comes across as fairly generic medieval fantasy, which isn’t helped by some flat lighting and an overbearing soundtrack of wailing singers. The bodies in motion are the film’s main draw, and between the flourishes of action, Han homes in on detailed close-ups which keep the violence from feeling overbearing even as Vesemir himself becomes numb to it. In contrast to his more cynical witcher peer, Vesemir’s idealism reinforces his status as the unfortunate moral compass at the centre of a morally ambiguous conflict. The series may be misanthropic in tone, but its main character retains some hope that things can be fixed with reason. Despite this, Nightmare of the Wolf often feels as slight as the show that preceded it, even though it offers more depth and historical detail to their shared setting. It’s simply more interested in the monster-slaying, and when it moves as well as this does, who can blame it?

"Aug 20, 2021"," While fans of Netflix's ""The Witcher"" series eagerly await December for season two, the streaming service has a new movie to tide them over. It's called ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf,"" and fans of the series will be pleased. ""The Witcher"" franchise has really grown in popularity over the last few years, starting with the release of ""The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt"" video game for Xbox One and Playstation 4. That game ended up being an anniversary present from my wife, and I loved it. One of the great things about ""The Witcher"" franchise is it has so many jumping in points. There's the original book series by Andrzej Sapkowski, the even more popular video game franchise (which has sold more than 50 million copies), or the Netflix series starring Henry Cavill, which debuted right before covid-19 hit. There's also a Polish film called ""The Hexer."" ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" is an animated film that serves as a prequel/spinoff of sorts for the live-action Netflix series with Cavill. It's 81 minutes long and focuses on the back story of a character that'll appear in season two of the forthcoming series. But fans of the novels and/or video games will already know Vesemir. For those unfamiliar, the world of The Witcher is a medieval-like fantasy series set in a grim world full of monsters. It's a cynical and dark series where, in most cases, the only way to protect your loved ones facing a monstrous threat is to hire a witcher. Witchers are monster hunters, humans mutated through strange magic and potions to gain extra abilities. They've got a little magic, enhanced senses, greater strength, faster healing, slowed aging and more. The process is painful and kills most of the young boys who undergo the transformation and trials. It's meant to be horrific and teach audiences the only way for monster hunters to kill monsters is to become like them in some ways. There are no obvious heroes in the world of ""The Witcher."" If you don't have coin to hire a witcher, you're fresh out of luck, because they don't do charity. It's a point Vesemir (Theo James) makes early on in the film. The story begins with a father traveling through a forest with his kids when they stop for a potty break. ""The Witcher"" immediately shows audiences it's going to be a mature film filled with blood and gore, even a little nudity in one scene. The family is quickly slaughtered by a horrific monster, and as the only surviving child is about to be killed, Vesemir shows up to kill the beast. The witcher dispatches his foe and saves the boy but then turns to leave, ready to collect his coin for killing the beast. As the boy informs Vesemir that he's of noble blood, and the witcher can't just abandon him, our protagonist just turns and smiles. We soon learn Vesemir did abandon the boy, telling him to practice his sad face so a traveling merchant or someone else coming down the road might give him a ride home. ""The Witcher"" sets a tone right off the bat that there are no heroes in the movie, just witchers motivated by coin and those in the world who fear and hate them. I'm not joking when I say even at the film's climax I found myself turning to Meghan and saying, ""I don't know who to root for."" Vesemir isn't an evil guy, but he is entirely selfish. As he takes a warm bath and treats himself to booze and fresh fruit with the money he earned, Vesemir speaks with an elf to translate a phrase the monster spoke just before death. When the translator informs Vesemir that elvish girls have been disappearing and asks for his help to find them, the witcher shrugs his shoulders. There's no money to be had, so he's not interested in ""elvish drama."" It's a constant theme in the Witcher universe, large quantities of suffering, usually at the hands of monsters or evil wielders of magic. Once in a while a witcher might come along and accomplish something good, but they won't look pretty doing it, and it's almost never an act of charity. The world is filled with hatred, and the only reasons witchers are tolerated is because they do kill monsters others can't. Yet even this service earns them no adoring fans or gratitude. The main antagonist for this film is a sorceress named Tetra (Lara Pulver), who urges the local ruler to drive the witchers out of their nearby fortress. She isn't a hero, but Tetra does have her own reason for hating witchers. You'd be surprised how much story ""The Witcher"" is able to weave together in 81 minutes. Interspersed through the film are scenes of young Vesemir, a poor servant who barely gets enough to eat and dreams of going off on adventures. When he meets a witcher named Deglan (Graham McTavish), the boy decides he, too, wants to be a witcher, and finds his way to Kaer Morhen (fortress of the witchers). He enters with a group of boys who are also training to become witchers, and the pain they undergo through magic and mutations is unspeakable. The film does a great job of showing the cost Vesemir pays for strength to go out adventuring and surviving in the world. And while he's a cheeky S.O.B. as an adult and a powerful fighter, underneath is a hollow boy who might sometimes wish he'd stayed at home with his father and childhood crush. One of the strengths of ""The Witcher"" video games is the rustic and beautiful soundtrack that plays as you explore the large fantasy world, killing monsters. ""The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf"" does a great job supplying the same level of audio excellence throughout the movie. It feels at times like the music has been cherry-picked from the game. Studio Mir handled the animation for this film, and it's pretty good. The action is fluid and smooth, the character designs are mystical, and the monsters look spooky. It's everything you'd want from a Witcher movie. I was tickled to learn Studio Mir also handled animation for ""Legend of Korra,"" which is the sequel to the critically acclaimed ""Avatar: The Last Airbender"" cartoon. Korra had a great deal of fighting and action, and I always thought Studio Mir did a fantastic job with all of the combat and raw elements being wielded by martial artists. The story in ""The Witcher"" might not make sense if you haven't seen the series, read the books or played the games. It's not extremely accessible to newcomers. But that often seems to be the trade-off for projects like this. Do the creators make something more generalized for new audiences to come in and risk alienating the longtime fans, or do they craft a film or series that pleases traditional fans and isn't quite as accessible for newcomers? This film seems to have chosen the latter, and I'm OK with that. But I also loved the games and Netflix series (not the books, though). If you're already a Witcher fan, you'll probably enjoy this movie. If you're new, well ... there are worse ways to spend 81 minutes of your life.

"Aug 20, 2021"," The hit fantasy drama takes a detour into the past for a stand-alone animated adventure about a dashing witcher named Vesemir (voiced by Theo James). As confusing as the fractured timeline of The Witcher‘s first season could be, one advantage it offered was an immediate sense that the show’s fantasy universe had history and scope — that it contained other times or places or people who might be worth exploring beyond their relevance to our protagonists. The show’s first spinoff, the animated movie The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf, takes advantage of that broad-mindedness, delving into the past for a chapter about a previously unseen character called Vesemir (Theo James). Fans of the franchise may recognize the name as that of the man who trained Geralt, the lead character played by Henry Cavill in the show. But Nightmare of the Wolf asks us to care about Vesemir on his own terms, and mostly it succeeds. While the film is unlikely to hold much appeal for Netflix subscribers who never cared about The Witcher to begin with, it’s a worthy side quest for anyone with a passing interest in seeing more of the Continent. The script by Beau DeMayo, who also works on the live-action series, follows the basic outline of one of Geralt’s monster-of-the-week storylines. Vesemir, a witcher (i.e., a monster hunter for hire), is tasked with tracking down a deadly creature that stalks the woods bordering the kingdom of Kaedwen — even as a lady (Mary McDonnell) and a sorceress (Lara Pulver) within the court argue over whether to get rid of the witchers themselves, and even as it becomes apparent that the monster’s true provenance holds horrifying implications for the world Vesemir knows. As a hero, Vesemir fits neatly into the “lovable rogue” archetype, and James brings enough warmth to his delivery to keep the character’s ever-present smirk from calcifying into a sneer. He quips at monsters while slashing at them, disdains adorable moppets in need of salvation, and takes equal pleasure in collecting coin and in spending it on booze, fine food and, of course, hot baths. But naturally, there’s more to him than meets the eye, and Nightmare of the Wolf quickly sets about excavating his childhood through lengthy flashbacks. Vesemir, we learn, was a servant boy whose chance encounter with a witcher named Deglan (Graham McTavish) inspired him to become a witcher himself — a rare choice in the Witcher universe, where most witchers need to be forced into the profession because it’s considered so dangerous and distasteful. The hows and whys of his decision elevate Vesemir from a character who’s fun to watch to one who’s easy to care about, and they’ll prove essential to the deeper emotions driving the story in the present. (They also touch upon the themes of intolerance and self-preservation that Nightmare of the Wolf likes to explain to anyone who’ll listen, but the film works better as a character study than as a profound analysis of the values of either this universe or our own.) The problem is that these scenes are also a drag on the pacing of the first half of the movie, cutting in right when the plot seems to be picking up. Moreover, voice actor David Errigo Jr. struggles to bridge the character’s hardscrabble origins with his debonair adult persona, resulting in a young Vesemir who’s more bratty than bold. The childhood scenes do have their charms; there’s a training sequence in a neon-green swamp that’s more unsettling than the more explicit violence of the film’s battles. But it can be hard to shake off the impatience to just move on and return to the present already. Then again, nothing lasts that long in Nightmare of the Wolf anyway, given its 81-minute run time. And all that groundwork does pay off in a breathless third act packed with bloody thrills, tragic twists and even a touch of romance. Director Kwang Il Han and Studio MIR bring Nightmare of the Wolf to life with an anime-influenced style that, while familiar (the studio is also responsible for Avatar: The Legend of Korra, among other hits), echoes its hero’s elegance and efficiency. Action scenes capitalize on the flexibility offered by animation — expect lots of drama, plenty of blood and a healthy disregard for “realism” — and occasionally achieve real beauty, as with a fight that flies over a bruised red sky. With its slim self-contained arc, Nightmare of the Wolf is no substitute for a new season of The Witcher — but it’s all the better because it’s not trying to be. Sure, there are connections to be found for those inclined to look. Vesemir’s backstory offers hints about Geralt’s own, and it’s a safe bet that some of the names mentioned in passing here will come up again later. But by resisting the temptation to tie its fate too closely to Geralt’s (or to any of the series’ main characters’, for that matter), Nightmare of the Wolf serves up a satisfying peek at a universe that always seemed richer than any one story.",POSITIVE
"Aug 17, 2021"," A lot of fantasy sagas are carried by the strength of the worlds in which they take place, and not necessarily the strength of the individual characters in them. Frodo’s journey to Mordor is thrilling, sure, but it’s not really because Frodo’s a particularly thrilling character. It’s because he’s a simple and kind person, albeit one who possesses an endless well of inner strength, who is pushed out into a world that is very much not simple or kind (it certainly stands out that there aren’t any famous sagas about hobbits who don’t go on life-changing adventures). That is very much not the case for Andrzej Sapkowski’s Witcher books, though. The best thing about them is main protagonist Geralt Of Rivia, the eponymous witcher played by Henry Cavill in the live-action Netflix adaptation of the books. Geralt is an anachronistic fantasy character who actively pushes back against the fact that he lives in a fantasy world, even as it conspires to constantly put him in the position to save princesses, undo evil curses, and fall in love with beautiful sorceresses. He’s a hero, but he’s a hero who thinks being a hero is stupid.  Netflix’s new anime prequel Nightmare Of The Wolf, on the other hand, offers a fairly compelling counterargument. It takes place years before Geralt became a witcher, focusing instead on his mentor Vesemir (who will make his live-action debut in season two of the Netflix show), and it does a good job selling the world of The Witcher beyond its best character. A lot of that is thanks to the characterization of Vesemir here, who is more of a dashing rogue or a Han Solo-type than Geralt, which lends Nightmare Of The Wolf a wilder, quippier energy than mainline Witcher stories. Basically, Vesemir is really good at being a witcher and loves his job, while Geralt is really, really good at being a witcher but acts like his job is being a can opener for the Flintstones. Unfortunately for Vesemir, the plot of Nightmare Of The Wolf is largely about dissuading him of that enthusiasm. That’s not to say it isn’t an entertaining adventure, but it starts off fun and then it becomes kind of sad (an arc that fans of the Witcher stories may recognize from, oh, most of them), charting Vesemir’s path from naively excitable hero-for-hire to the sort of grizzled mentor-type who could teach Geralt and the other comparatively young witchers how to survive in a world that hates and fears them. (Nightmare Of The Wolf also covers some ground in that department, establishing backstory for why witchers are so distrusted in Geralt’s time.) The plot is also probably the weakest part of Nightmare Of The Wolf, if only because you can guess where it’s going even if you haven’t read the books or watched the mainline show, save for a mid-game twist that isn’t quite resolved how you might expect. There’s a violent, action-loving male hero, a magic-using, too-smart-for-this female hero who gets paired up with him even though they hold diametrically opposed viewpoints, and they’re tasked with finding and killing some kind of monster that’s been terrorizing a small town… it’s all very Castlevania, or at least Netflix’s Castlevania anime, but thankfully that’s a good thing. Like Castlevania, the best thing about Nightmare Of The Wolf is the very violent action, which not only shows Vesemir flying through the air and ripping through monsters with his witcher sword in a way that Geralt—no disrespect to Henry Cavill—would never be able to pull off in the show without some aesthetic-breaking wire work, but there are a lot of lore-accurate details that are fun to see. Vesemir drinks potions that make his eyes look scary, he pours special oils on his sword before going into battle, and, like in the books, witcher-style swordplay involves a lot of pirouetting and feinting that is a little more visually dynamic than the mindless charging and swinging you mostly see in your Lord Of The Rings or your Game Of Thrones.  The voice acting is all serviceable, with the various witchers clearly having the most fun with it. Nearly everyone else (including Lara Pulver, Graham McTavish, and Mary McDonnell) is just doing a “solemn, vaguely British fantasy person” voice, which does the job. It would’ve been fun to have Kim Bodnia, who will depict Vesemir on The Witcher, voice the character here to establish a bit of continuity between the animated spin-off and the regular show, but this take from Theo James of the Divergent movies is plenty of fun. (He’s too young and handsome to play live-action Vesemir, though.) Nightmare Of The Wolf isn’t a replacement for seeing Geralt drop dad jokes, hang out with a poet, and fall in love with sorceresses, but it is a nice appetizer for the next release from the Witcher universe (season two is coming on December 17). It’s fun to see this world, with all of its inhuman monsters and monstrous humans, from a different point of view, even if it isn’t quite as refreshing or engaging as Geralt’s. ",POSITIVE
"Aug 17, 2021"," When a network announces a spinoff movie — especially an animated one — you’d be forgiven for not considering it required viewing. Projects like this are typically one-and-done deals. You get a new chapter with a fan favorite hero where they defeat a big, new enemy that ultimately doesn’t matter, and then move on to the actual story. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf bucks that trend almost entirely. Not only does Netflix’s new anime-inspired movie give a satisfying backstory for Geralt’s long-beloved mentor, Vesemir, but in the process it also expands this universe, clearly defining the tolls of being a witcher while also justifying Geralt’s calloused view of the world. It’s the rare spinoff that makes every detail of its universe feel richer. When we first meet Geralt in any iteration of this story, he comes from the same place. Geralt is always grizzled and world-weary, a reflection of his nearly 100 years on The Continent. That’s not the sort of witcher we’re introduced to through Nightmare of the Wolf‘s protagonist. Vesemir (Theo James) instantly feels as reckless and arrogant as any young man with too much power. When he completes a job, his success is defined by smug smirks and rowdy nights spent drinking and partying with his fellow witchers — a far cry from Geralt’s silent brooding. Through Vesemir’s eyes the movie shows what a witcher is supposed to be: a monster killer who makes the lives of everyday people a little easier. He’s like a monster-slaying lawyer. Sure, he’s going to cost you, but when you need a witcher, that price tag become irrelevant. Aside from Andrzej Sapkowski’s novels, Nightmare of the Wolf also offers the most comprehensive look into what it takes to become this specialized killer. Flashback after flashback tells the sad truth of Vesemir’s life, an unwanted child claimed by the Law of Surprise who was forced to watch his orphaned friends die at the hands of the Kaer Morhen’s many tests. The trials and debilitating potions required to turn a man into a witcher have been mentioned in passing before. But Nightmare of the Wolf is the first property to truly dive into emotional toll this process takes, showing scarring scene after scene that’s reminiscent of Yennefer’s (Anya Chalotra) transformation into a sorceress. When the cost of power is the loss of almost everyone you’ve ever care about, what is the point? The answer, Nightmare of the Wolf argues, is the nobility of this profession, the chance to save the hunted. But even that is called into question in this movie’s universe-altering climax. Without revealing any spoilers, Nightmare of the Wolf fully dives into the assault on Kaer Morhen in the 12th century through the sorceress Tetra (Lara Pulver) and the mysterious Lady Zerbst (Mary McDonnell). This often acknowledged but barely explained battle between men, sorcerers, and witchers led to the extermination of most witchers as well as the witcher creation process. It’s the event that directly established Geralt and his brothers as possibly the last of their kind. Fans have long known that this battle happened because men turned on witchers. Director Kwang Il Han and writer Beau DeMayo’s film explains why that shift happened, and by its end it’s hard not to at least understand their hostile motivations. Though he starts out his saga roughly the same age as Geralt in The Witcher, Vesemir’s story is one of growing up. It’s about disillusionment and one man realizing that his idols and life’s work are filthier and more corrupt than the monsters he hunts. More than its concise explanations about how witchers are created, the battle of Kaer Morhen, or the Law of Surprise, its this reframing that makes Nightmare of the Wolf essential. As we tee up for The Witcher Season 2, we have a more complete understanding of the loving grandfather figure Kim Bodnia will be portraying in this twisted world. We understand his scars just as well as we understand the root of his surprising gentleness as he embraces Ciri as a new addition to his found family. Geralt is one of the few children who lived through the siege of Kaer Morhen, witnessed the deaths of his mentors, and saw firsthand what sort of horrors his profession could cause. These truly traumatizing events clearly influenced Vesemir as a mentor and Geralt as a person. Netflix’s film shows rather than tells that Geralt’s stoicism has never been rooted in apathy. Rather, it’s shame and a fear of that keeps our gruff hero permanently on the fence as The Continent battles around him. That restructuring makes the generation-changing decisions Geralt has to make on Ciri’s behalf feel all the more dire.",POSITIVE
"Aug 16, 2021"," Netflix’s new prequel anime film  The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf tries to do so much it shouldn’t work. It provides significant history about the Continent and its magical users, namely mages and witchers, filling in many of the holes the live-action show’s first season didn’t fully address. It also serves as an origin story for a character joining the series in season two, Vesemir,  the witcher who trained Geralt. The witcher home of Kaer Morhen also gets to shine  ahead of its introduction on the show. The movie is also full of so many terrifying monsters it doubles as a living encyclopedia of ghastly beasts. And it does all of this while telling a personal story that spans decades, as well as a much larger story with ramifications that will last even longer. It’s a lot. And it probably shouldn’t work, but it does. Somehow the film does all of those things while still telling a coherent, well-paced, entertaining, and moving story. One that is certainly a must-watch for fans of the show. And a great introduction for those thinking about watching. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is not for the feint of heart. The Continent is a dangerous world of monsters. If not for witchers, it would be a world full of monsters, shredded limbs, and blood. A lot of blood. In some significant ways it does an even better job than the show of showing why witchers are so important—and so feared—in this world. It’s a crash course in this universe’s lore and every day life. Giving new context for who witchers are, where they come from, and what they do. The movie also explores the group’s less than stellar past. Not everyone who walked the path of a witcher had the same morals as Geralt. Not all of his older brothers were as grumpy as him, though. Vesemir most of all. The film’s main character is nothing the like groaning, angry witcher who leads Netflix’s show. While just as handsome as Geralt, Vesemir is inherently charming and gregarious. He’s also far more selfish than his famous student. Viewers will often find themselves liking him in spite of him. Forget being a great and noble hero. He might not even be a very good person, though his skills as a witcher are more than formidable. But he’s not the only magical being with impressive talents. Tetra Gilcrest, a powerful sorceress who distrust witchers entirely, is a worthy adversary. Monsters roam all over the Continent. Often in unexpected forms. Tetra wants to protect the land from all of them. Like Vesemir, there’s more to her story that gets revealed throughout the film. And the more you learn about her the more interesting both she and everyone around her becomes. The same is true of the movie’s other main characters, as numerous threads come together for a poignant and exciting end. One that is far more epic and important to the franchise than the kind of conclusion it seems like the film is initially building towards. From Lady Zerbst, an elderly noblewoman who defends witchers, to Deglan, the witcher who recruited and trained Vesemir, everyone has more going on than they initially let on. When they do show all their cards—either because they want to or because they’re forced too—the entire film goes from being a fun exploration of this world to a major installment. That’s why even though the first third of the film feels a little disjointed initially, it all comes together in a satisfying way. The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf boasts a great score. ( No surprise for this franchise.) The animation is vibrant, especially during action sequences when it really excels. And its main characters are complex and interesting. Fans of Netflix’s series won’t want to miss it. And they’ll be able to recommend it to their Witcher-curious friends considering watching the show. At a tidy 81 minutes it’s not a timely investment, especially compared to the ten-episode first season. But it really works because it does so many things well. It’s more than just a supplemental piece to the show. It has something to say about this world and the people who live in it—what they want from life and from themselves. And how we often create the monsters we fear the most. The question isn’t whether you should watch it. The question is when is Netflix going to make more The Witcher anime films.

"Aug 16, 2021"," The animated fantasy world of The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf feels trapped in an 83-minute film. No doubt it is lovely to look at as a Netflix Original Anime—a stricter definition of “anime” is stretching it, being applied to the work of a South Korea-based animation company. For as much as Studio Mir’s smatterings of color and movement will please the eye as it did with Legend of Korra and Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, the mission of the story is lost in a haze. Produced and penned by Witcher staff writer Beau DeMayo, Nightmare of the Wolf focuses on Vesemir, the mentor of the star of the Netflix series, Geralt. Vesemir is a slight antithesis to the grumpish Geralt played by a grimy and guttural Henry Cavill. The man who will become Geralt’s teacher is a smug Casanova type, a profane hedonist who would rather sleep, eat, and drink away when he’s not slaughtering beasts for coin. Theo James, reprising the role after a one-line voice cameo in the live-action show, is Castlevania’s Hector voicing a suaver Trevor Belmont. (Kim Bodnia will play Vesemir in the second season of The Witcher.) Steeped in the fantasy world of Andrzej Sapkowski’s books, Vesemir’s land is wrought with tensions between humans and Witchers, the latter race being magically engineered from experimentations on human children, “mutagen alchemy” as it is called. Witchers and their mercenary ways aren’t well received in society, even if the locals require their special bestial expertise, and it doesn’t help that Vesemir refuses to fit a romantic picture of a mercenary saving the day. After he slays a lechen, he amorally collects gold and silver from the monsters’ slaughter victims and strands a surviving child to be picked up by a passerby. Vesemir’s apathy contributes to a public narrative that Witchers are immoral.  This gives ammo for the nobleborn witch Tetra (Lara Pulver) to divulge her suspicions of the Witchers to her royal court, citing the scruples and cons of Witchers. She’s especially skeptical of the king’s advisor Lady Zerst (a buoyant Mary McDonnell), a commoner married into nobility, who stands to prevent a war between Witchers and the kingdom. For Vesemir, being a Witcher was all choice for him despite his peers often getting snagged into the vocation against their will, be it parental abandonment and sometimes through the Law of Surprise. Whether a poor chap is snagged by cruel fate is irrelevant to him. Vesemir’s interest in the profession began with observing Deglan (Graham McTavish), an elder Witcher, methodically exorcise a demon creature from a noble lady’s body and earn a hefty sack of gold. Sick of changing bedpans for nobles, Vesemir fled his life of servitude for the Witcher base of Kaer Morhen where his body and mind undergo grueling trials to give him the expertise and physicality of a Witcher. But while sprouting into a star Witcher, Vesemir rejects Deglan’s call to teach the next monster-slaying generation. Eventually, Vesemir is whisked into investigating a beast-related mystery regarding a lechen that speaks elvish tongue. Indecisive smatterings of flashbacks, intended to drop clues and foreshadowing just as much as flesh out Vesemir, fracture the pacing. As The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf submerges, abruptly, into Vesemir’s childhood, its young adult nature is at odds with the more adult feel of the present timeline. It’s not until a third through the movie that the plot incentivizes momentum. Credit is due to the watchful artistic eye of director Kwang Il Han, who deploys Studio Mir talents in fights sequences. Witcher and non-Witcher viewers alike can appreciate the embellishments achievable in the grace of animation to the swishing of Brian D’Oliveira’s scoring. The dramatic highlight is a transformation process that illuminates Vesemir’s rebirth into a new man, paired with a letter reading of a childhood sweetheart saying farewell, mingling melancholy and pining with physical agony. Select sequences could spotlight choreography alone, such as a witch’s balletic dance to shroud a landscape and a climactic combat that punctuates an ensuing tragedy with a rude awakening. It also doesn’t slouch on macabre bestial designs. Other internal qualities are not as realized or the worldbuilding, while present, lacks breathing space to inspire any intense feelings, be it revulsion or pity or both, for the morals and motives of its side characters. While well voiced by Dota star Pulver, Tetra is vaguely rendered to full potential, an excuse for a final boss rather than operating as a morally complicated force as the script promises for her. In another example, Filandrevel, the exiled elf king encountered by Geralt in The Witcher and reprised by Tom Canton, amounts to little impact.  He operates as a momentary foil to Vesemir—possibly a red herring to a mystery—but barely scratches a dent in the plot when they cross paths again. Whereas his appearance of a hidden elven race oppressed by human colonists, could add breadth to the world as it did with his debut in the series, he and the backdrop of elven genocide feel emotionally remote from Vesemir’s arc or a lived-in feel for world-building. An emotional anchor slams at the 40-minute mark thanks to a reunion that acts as a heart wrenching sneak attack—and dagger-sharp dialogue with both humor and heart. This is where the magical universe is the most lived in, drenched with the bittersweetness of star-crossed companions who grew eons and fates apart. Their wistful chemistry elegantly imagines two souls affected by the fantastical and transformative circumstances and I dare not speak of its final image. It’s tougher to absorb the potential poignancy in the other peeps of tragedy bursting through acts of deceptions and desperation and unfolding plights. Longer than an average hourly Witcher episode, The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf as a film overstays its compacted length, as if its painterly realm, Vesemir’s history, and cast would unfurl better as an animated miniseries than a film. The movie leaves a few curious loose ends, enough you may suspect this to be a stealth pilot or hinting to other stories elsewhere in the franchise. They do not, thankfully, fall into the trap of serving as cliffhangers for this self-contained film. At best (coming from someone who has only seen the Netflix series and did not play the video games or read the books), Witcher fans may find it to be a pulp pleaser. It isn’t exactly an underbaked cake. Even for its shortness of flavor, the few sweet crumbs make a solid case that it deserves more.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 16, 2021"," A prequel to The Witcher Season 1 that also sets up characters and events that will be important to Season 2 of the Netflix show, The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is torn between the franchise’s future and its past. While it’s filled with lore and character building that might please dedicated fans, the split focus keeps the animated film from feeling like a story that can really stand on its own. Nightmare of the Wolf follows Geralt of Rivia’s mentor and surrogate father Vesemir, who is voiced by Divergent’s Theo James (but will be played by Killing Eve’s Kim Bodnia in The Witcher Season 2). The young Vesemir couldn’t be more different than the White Wolf, a carefree rake who loves showing off, mixing witty banter with swordplay and then regaling ladies with tales of his adventures. James feels like he’s channeling Nathan Fillion’s swaggering Hal Jordan as he exudes a carefree charm, but there’s more than a little cruelty beneath it when he’s dealing with those he doubts have the strength or will to survive the harsh fantasy world of Andrzej Sapkowski’s books. IGN's Matt Purslow gave Season 1 of The Witcher a 6.5. While he praised Henry Cavill as a perfect live-action Geralt of Rivia, he called the first season ""unconventional and messy."" ""It’s failed by its convoluted structure, which ultimately restricts character growth, and prevents the show from having any true sense of depth,"" he added. Vesemir’s path from a lowly servant to a professional monster slayer is told in flashbacks, and writer Beau DeMayo uses the same storytelling trick he helped employ as a writer on The Witcher Season 1, playing with expectations of how much time has passed between scenes based on how slowly Witchers age. The technique is cleverly used here, but DeMayo and director Kwang Il Han are a little too fond of misdirection in a story that tries to deliver plenty of twists but winds up being pretty predictable. The plot sees Vesemir investigating monster attacks near Kaer Morhen, the mountain stronghold where the witchers of the School of the Wolf train. At the same time, the powerful sorceress Tetra (Sherlock’s Lara Pulver) is urging an attack on the fortress, pointing out that the witchers are magical mutants who don’t seem to be doing a particularly good job of protecting the populace. Like many prequels, Nightmare of the Wolf suffers from a feeling of inevitability. The film is very similar to Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, with two factions that feel threatened and desperate moving closer to direct confrontation. It’s in everyone’s best interest for cooler heads to prevail, but if you know much about the series, it’s clear early on that things aren’t going to work out so smoothly. Like in Avengers: Age of Ultron, the movie tries to stuff in too many nods to characters and conflicts that will be important later. Some plots, like a scathing indictment of the genocidal war against the elves and other Elder Races, still at least add to the narrative of the film they’re in. The name dropping of major characters appearing in Season 2 of the Netflix show adds little beyond a shallow attempt at hype building. Where Nightmare of the Wolf does shine is the animation, which allows for storytelling that would be impractical even with the live-action show’s impressive budget. There are some excellent fight sequences that really capture the sword and sorcery roots of The Witcher. Some are riffs on things previously done in the series, like a dizzying fight with portals, but others feel like genuinely novel ways to mix spells, alchemy, and weapons that seem like they come from a deep place of affection for and knowledge of the source material. The film takes a more is more approach to its action, which doesn’t always work. It’s exciting seeing Vesemir or his own mentor Deglan (Graham McTavish) taking on one or two fierce and wily monsters, but having multiple armies and swarms of creatures in the climax turns the affair into a ludicrous chaotic spectacle that feels more akin to an Avengers film or Lord of the Rings than The Witcher’s grittier tone. For all the carnage, the film’s nature as a prequel takes away many of the stakes if this isn’t your first experience with the Witcher. But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t have an emotional impact. Kaer Morhan is gorgeous in its full glory, but it’s also a place of nightmares. The sequence showing Vesemir and his fellow recruits undergoing the Trial of the Grasses, the alchemical process that gives the witchers who survive their superhuman abilities, is the film’s most visceral. That’s saying something, since it also includes a spider-like monster crawling out of a woman and the gory dismemberment of multiple children. It provides new lore involving the fate of Kaer Morhan and the origins of monsters, which is sure to intrigue some fans, but is also a little heavy-handed in getting across the idea that man is the greatest monster of them all. DeMayo plays with the series’ other dominant themes to varying effect. There’s a surprisingly sweet romance that peeks out from all the bloodshed that also subverts expectations for what happens to the people a hero leaves behind when he starts his epic journey. The concept of destiny is also played with here, as various characters question how much agency they’ve had in their lives. There’s even a funny jab at the concept of the Law of Surprise — gifting someone you owe a favor with something you don’t know you have — which is so key to the plot of The Witcher. But the jokes and charm are too often weighed down by the movie’s attempts to hammer home core messages, with characters repeating lines like “a witcher never hesitates” scene after scene.  The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf isn’t a bad film, but it fundamentally lacks an identity of its own. It’s a fine way to spend 80 minutes if you want to pick up some fresh lore and get to meet a very different Vesemir than the one we’re likely to see in Season 2, but it probably won’t get anyone new to the franchise to stick around, or even convince anyone who was lukewarm on the live-action series to get more invested in the world.",NEUTRAL
"Aug 16, 2021"," The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a captivating blood fest of a tale that is a great way to get your feet with with the lore. Going into The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf knowing nothing at all about the lore, was a lot easier than expected. This film was able to suck me right in with the animation style, the action, the blood and gore, and a really intriguing story. Fans of The Witcher live action series, books, and video games are sure to enjoy it as well considering that it is an important prequel to Geralt’s story. This anime movie tells the story of Geralt’s mentor, Vesemir, and what a story it is! Witchers hunt and kill monsters, and he is one of the best. But when a new breed of monster starts terrorizing the lands, he discovers a lot more than he would like to. What follows is a bloody story, that is a complete joy to watch. If you are someone who can get queasy with things like blood and gore, you might want to be prepared to look away. They push the envelope with this film, which viewers like me can appreciate. Let’s just say there is more than one instance where you see an eyeball hanging out of its socket — and each of them are glorious.  As for the voice cast, they all do a decent job, especially Vesemir. He is extremely believable as a young swashbuckling Witcher, who cares a lot about the coin, and has a blast killing monsters. The writing certainly helps this, as does the stunning animation. There are a lot of scenes that simply look gorgeous, no matter what murderous deeds are being done in them.  For someone who is completely new to the franchise, this is a good place to start. It very clearly takes place at the start of the lore, and does a great job explaining everything about it. Viewers learn who Witchers are, why they were created, and a whole lot more too. We get to know Vesemir, and might even get a glimpse at Geralt too.  This feels like a great lead in for the live action show, and considering it takes place before season 1, is a good place to start. With a captivating story like this one, it is sure to make newcomers eager to dive in to it all — I know it has me excited. There are likely a few references and nods to things that those who are familiar with Witcher lore will appreciate, but missing them doesn’t take away from the overall experience of the movie. While the movie is quite enjoyable, it is not perfect. There is some great animation, but there are few times it slips, especially on some close up face shots as people are talking. It is not bad enough to take away from the story, but it is noticeable here and there. Another issue with this movie is that despite its short runtime, it does drag a little bit here and there. Of course the point of that is to get the dialogue out there character and story building, but when there is no action it is missed — which is to say that the action is by far the best, and more brutal part of the film.  The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf is a great addition to the Witcher franchise and works well as a prequel to the live action series. For those wondering if the Witcher lore is for them, this is the perfect place to start. Due to the nature of the animation, they are able to pull off a lot more than they could with live action. The monsters are unique, deadly, and really cool looking. Of course there is a lot of insane action that include some blood and gore, too.  The overall story is very intriguing and captivating and is sure to hook those who know nothing about it. This is very clearly a set up for what is to come. Those who watch this movie first, are sure to be eager to dive right into the live action Netflix series, and learn even more about witchers and their world. The world of The Witcher expands in this anime origin story: Before Geralt, there was his mentor Vesemir — a swashbuckling young witcher who escaped a life of poverty to slay monsters for coin. But when a strange new monster begins terrorizing a politically-fraught kingdom, Vesemir finds himself on a frightening adventure that forces him to confront the demons of his past.

"Aug 16, 2021"," The Witcher franchise is growing by leaps and bounds, and after a long wait, fans can finally see the latest addition to the canon in Netflix's new anime film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf. Nightmare brings Geralt's mentor Vesemir into the spotlight, giving fans a look at the fan-favorite Witcher in his prime and shedding new light on foundational events in the Witcher mythology that were still a bit shrouded in mystery. The result is a thrilling ride through Witcher history full of style, pulse-pounding action, and often brutal choices that no Witcher fan dare miss, and I couldn't recommend it more. Beau DeMayo and Lauren S. Hissrich are able to retain a similar vibe and tone to the live-action series, while director Kwang Il Han and Studio Mir infuse each and every scene with stellar style and flair. Like the mainline series, Nightmare of the Wolf is once again based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski, but like its live-action brother, it also makes a change or two to certain elements of the mythos. It can be dangerous to take narrative liberties when you're dealing with a beloved series, but the changes here only enhance the intrigue and add welcome context, and they also don't conflict or butt heads with what's been established in the main series, so they seem to have once again pulled it off. The voice cast is stellar on all fronts, but quite a bit of the weight rests on Vesemir's shoulders, and Theo James is simply astounding in the role. This is a Vesemir still in his prime, unburdened with the knowledge he will eventually come to understand, and he's simply a delight. A little cocky but not obnoxiously so, and while he's focused on obtaining as much coin as he can, his compassionate heart shines through enough to always keep you in his corner, and James brings all of those elements to life brilliantly throughout. There's a subtle layer underneath the self-assured exterior, and it's Mary McDonnell's Lady Zerbst who is most responsible for bringing it out of him. While the relationship between Vesemir and Graham McTavish's Deglan is responsible for some of the movie's biggest moments, Zerbst and Vesemir's relationship is responsible for some of the most important ones and forms the heart of this epic story. That said, DeMayo and Hissrich utilize Deglan and Lara Pulver's Tetra to explore the mythology around Witchers, whether that's regarding how they are created, the ripple effects of that creation, or how they are viewed by those they protect. Witchers are quite polarizing after all, and Nightmare takes some time to flesh out why they are so divisive and if those opinions and assumptions have any grounding in reality. When the swords start swinging and the signs start pulsing, it is a sight to behold. Studio Mir fills each action sequence with a supreme sense of scale and motion, and Vesemir dazzles in each and every sequence as he swiftly vaults across the battlefield with an impressive elegance while cleaving enemies and leaving bloody corpses and decapitated heads in his wake. Oh yes, Nightmare doesn't hold back on the brutality, and that goes for the action sequences as well as sequences more closely tied to the origin of Witchers, and in both cases, it will definitely leave an impression. Everything comes together for a final act that just couldn't be done in live-action, at least not without a ridiculous budget, and you'll be on the edge of your seat the entire time. Honestly, I really don't have any issues with Nightmare, even of the nitpicky kind. I just want more, and I mean more of everything. More monsters, more of Vesemir's adventures, and more of what happens in between this time and when we first meet Geralt in the main series. That's not a list of nitpicks, that's a sequel, and you can sign me up for that right now. If you've been wondering what The Witcher is all about, this is a lovely introduction to the world of Sapkowski's novels or the live-action series. If you're already a fan of The Witcher, this is an absolute must-watch, and I'm going to need more Vesemir in my life ASAP.",POSITIVE
