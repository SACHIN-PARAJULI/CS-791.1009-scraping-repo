"Sep 23, 2023",If this movie has taught me anything it’s that video game movie adaptations will never be a sustainable avenue for Hollywood.,NEUTRAL
"Aug 8, 2023"," The ‘Uncharted’ video games have been huge since 2007, combining brisk action and a similar style of adventure as can typically be found in the likes of The Mummy, National Treasure and Indiana Jones. With five games in the series and an inherently cinematic style to the action, the franchise has long seemed ripe for a big screen adaptation. Even so, adapting the Naughty Dog games has proven a difficult task with the project going through development hell at Sony Pictures, a number of marquee directors from Travis Knight (Bumblebee) to David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook) and even Shawn Levy (Free Guy) attached to the project at various points with a number of actors considered for the role of central protagonist Nathan Drake. In February 2022, the Uncharted project has finally been released with Spider-Man himself Tom Holland in the role of Nate, Mark Wahlberg as his mentor and friend Victor “Sully” Sullivan, and Venom director Ruben Fleischer at the helm. The film tells an original story that borrows from the games’ mythology and character arcs. We see Nate and Sully facing off against wealthy adversaries to find a long-lost treasure hoard belonging to Portuguese explorers. Antonio Banderas plays antagonist Santiago Moncada, with Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer (a character from the games) and Tati Gabrielle as Braddock, a character who has something of a history with Sully. Uncharted acts as a fresh origin story for Drake, Tom Holland’s version working as a bartender and picking pockets on the side. Wahlberg’s Sully has a relationship with Nate’s long lost brother Sam and so ropes Nate into being his accomplice. As with the games, this is a globetrotting affair taking us from Barcelona to the Philippines although it never feels quite on the same level as with the games, perhaps missing some of the jungle or desert sequences that famously made the video game franchise so cinematic. The film’s opening pace is frenetic, largely avoiding bogging itself down in character introductions. While this means it has a lively zip to proceedings, often the characters (including Drake and Sully) can feel quite flat and underdeveloped. For a franchise with awe-inspiring set pieces at it its core, the action hereafter largely fails to replicate that of its predecessors, although there are some enjoyable sequences splintered throughout. Despite its naturally exciting premise, there is often a surprising lack of urgency, which is no more prominent than in how the plot develops at the behest of convenience rather than any meaningful character action. To make matters worse, the villains lack any form of menace. One standout sequence is a fast and brutal fight in a Barcelona bar that feels more in keeping with the tone of the games, but this is an exception that proves the rule and highlights how much of a shame it is that the film couldn’t generate more highlight-worthy moments of quality. The casting of Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg in the leading roles perhaps caused the most nervousness amongst fans in the run up to the film’s release and, while the characterisation doesn’t quite line up with their game counterparts, the pair are clearly putting in strong efforts. Holland is charming and shows he can lead a film of this scale, though he rarely feels close to the character he is supposed to be inhabiting. Meanwhile, Wahlberg is relegated to the role of comic relief for much of the middle act, detracting from the actor’s impact. Most disappointingly, Sophia Ali’s performance is questionable at best, with some decidedly interesting accent work on display, while the villains are never given a chance to explain their motives or to offer much by the way of threat to our protagonists. Despite obvious setbacks, Uncharted is a perfectly adequate two hours at the cinema. With the number of delays and changes to its cast and directors, it certainly could have been much worse. What will be most frustrating for fans of the video game franchise and distributors Sony is that the film fails to deliver the same level of quality as its source material, though newcomers might find more to enjoy. This is not a film without merit, its short-changing of the fanbase unlikely to detract from how it successfully fills the fantasy-action-adventure void left by The Mummy and National Treasure.

"Jul 25, 2023",What started as a video game produced by Play Station became a movie that just doesn&#8217;t hit all the notes it desperately tries to&#46; ,NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," Synopsis: Street-smart thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world's oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate's long-lost brother...but only if they can learn to work together. Uncharted is yet another attempt from Hollywood to contradict the famous curse of videogame film adaptations. The recent past shows improvements, but it hasn't yet been possible to create a work truly acclaimed by all types of spectators. Personally, I think authors of opinion pieces about videogame movie adaptations should clarify if they really have knowledge of the original source material. As such, I confess that, despite Uncharted being constantly on my ""list"" of games to try, I've never played any of its versions. What I know about the franchise comes from what gamer friends told me, so I had at least a visual idea of ​​what this adaptation by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland: Double Tap) would look like. Therefore, the following opinion has no bias regarding the videogames, not for good or bad. I believe that addressing the much-debated curse is a reasonable basis for justifying much of the positives and negatives of Uncharted. Why does Hollywood have so much trouble adapting a videogame with tremendous success, praised by critics and the general public alike? There are several reasons for this, but the main one is the inconsistency in narrative decisions about what to translate directly to the big screen and what to leave aside. As in an adaptation from a book, not everything is possible to simply be transported to cinema as if it were a mere copy-paste. In the case of Uncharted, the biggest problem lies in the feeling that the film would be much more exciting and interesting if the viewers were actually controlling the characters and deciphering the clues left by the story themselves. The first two acts are extremely focused on exposition and ""detective work"" that quickly becomes tiresome and repetitive while viewing, whereas if there was a joystick and the audience had to think to move the plot forward, everything would be much more captivating and engaging. Thus, the lack of energy and entertainment wears down the viewers who reach the third act with little desire to see the final resolution. Subsequently, another negative point emerges: the screenplay suffers immensely due to the lack of surprises. From the narrative itself to the character arcs, everything and everyone follows well-known formulas in which nothing has a real impact, leaving viewers with their mouths open more from yawning than stupefaction. Adding inconsistent secondary characters who don't even get a full arc - poor Antonio Banderas (Dolittle) and Sophia Ali (Truth or Dare) - only further alienates the audience that wants so much to get carried away by the world of Uncharted. The incessant backstabbing on the part of these characters and the constant changes of the main villain also become incredibly frustrating and irritating. A more divisive reason for the failure of this type of adaptation has to do with the visual effects. For example, Uncharted starts right in the middle of an action sequence - which then continues in the third act, an artistic decision that I admit I was never a big fan of - where the visuals switch between classic CGI and a more ""videogamy"" rendering. Here, there's always the question of whether the intention to make the actors look like videogame characters is a choice made by the filmmakers and the VFX artists or if the budget wasn't really enough to offer more realism. Given the overall action of the movie, I prefer to believe in the first option. Honestly, I think it's unfair and too superficial to denigrate a cinematic work due to small moments where the visuals might fail compared to other sequences. Anyone walking into a theater to watch Uncharted anticipating realistic action that complies with the laws of physics and logic is undoubtedly preparing to leave disappointed. There's a lot of entertainment in the last act, but it's a shame that an action-adventure flick saves pretty much all of its action and adventure for the last thirty minutes. In fact, Fleischer delivers a simultaneously extraordinary and absurd set piece in the end that, at least, offers a somewhat rewarding sensation, as if the time spent until then was worth the effort. Unfortunately, it doesn't pay off as much as it should. Even so, it's essential to appreciate the stunts performed, the vast majority of which being done by Tom Holland (Spider-Man: No Way Home) himself. Obviously, the actor brings a lot of fans of the superhero genre to the theater, but he continuously demonstrates that he's more than a mere spiderling. I believe Holland has the potential to lead a new action saga over the next decade. His chemistry with Mark Wahlberg (Infinite) is surprising, and their character arcs are the only ones worth the emotional investment on the part of the audience. Once again, I repeat that I hold no previous experience with the videogames, but the references and visual details are so explicit that even theoretically unknown cameos become evident. One last note about this point. There are more situations in which I find myself on the side where references to the original source make viewings more pleasant than on the other. It has happened before in Tomb Raider and in Sonic the Hedgehog, but by mere chance, Uncharted isn't part of my gaming knowledge. I enjoyed some adaptations more than others, but one thing is certain: it wasn't the little touches that warrant a smile here and there that illuminated the works I enjoyed the most, in the same way that they aren't enough to save eventual disasters. Uncharted is an action-adventure flick, but despite a more entertaining last act, it fails to break the curse of videogame film adaptations due precisely to the lack of said action and adventure. Even though Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg offer good performances, as well as convincing arcs by the two protagonists, Ruben Fleischer delivers an extremely generic and formulaic narrative based on endless exposition. Additionally, the secondary characters become irrelevant due to the irritatingly repetitive betrayals and constant shifts of the true antagonist. In the end, the general feeling is that it would be much more interesting to be controlling the characters than simply watching them. It may be enough for fans of the franchise, but for the average moviegoer, it's ""just one more"".",NEGATIVE
"Jul 25, 2023"," In 2007, Naughty Dog released the hit videogame Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune, and kickstarted a global phenomenon. Now more than a decade later, Sony’s adaptation Uncharted attempts to bring the adventure games to the big screen in an all-new globetrotting action movie full of treasure hunters, one-liners, and big-budget special effects.
 With A-list actors Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg leading the helm, plenty of detailed fighting sequences, and impressive set pieces, there are a handful of promising elements in this movie, and as a feel-good action fest, Uncharted in theory should be a home run. However, when you take a step back and look past all the CGI splendour and fast-paced chase scenes, you can’t help but notice that the latest attempt from Hollywood to adapt a videogame seems to fall into the age-old trap – style over substance.
 Directed by Ruben Fleischer, whose past credits include the likes of Zombieland and Venom, Uncharted sticks to the typical beats seen in any solid adventure movie. Throughout its two hour runtime, we are made to follow a clever and athletic protagonist who is searching to uncover a mystery as well as fill their pockets with priceless treasure. But, with a predictable plot, rudimentary puzzles, and strawman characters, Uncharted never manages to find its narrative bearings.
 Tom Holland, of Spider-Man fame, takes on the role of Nathan Drake, an expert pickpocket who dreams of reuniting with his lost brother Sam, as well as embarking on a life of adventure. One day he is approached and recruited by a mysterious associate of his estranged brother, the seasoned treasure hunter Victor ‘Sully’ Sullivan (Wahlberg). Together the two set out to uncover a 500-year-old fortune, and face off against the forces of the ruthless billionaire Moncada (Antonio Banderas) in the deadly race to capture the missing gold.
 As the film unfolds, we are thrust into a heist-like story filled with big imagery that captures the imagination. From underground Spanish vaults and flying pirate ships, to countless cases of double-crossing Uncharted at surface level has it all. But, that being said, impressive visuals aside, there is something about this thriller movie that feels unfinished and as if we are watching mundane NPC’s as opposed to real people.
 As much as I love Holland, here we see the actor essentially playing the same character he portrays in the MCU – repackaged for franchise purposes. Similarly, all his co-stars are void of strong personalities, as they try to uncover fortune detailed in the plot, and struggle to form any meaningful relationships.
 Written by Rafe lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, Uncharted had the potential to be a fast-paced and stupidly fun film. With multiple Indiana Jones references, it’s easy to see that the script was on the tipping point of embracing that fast-paced tomb raider style of movies that we all know and love from the ’80s.
 However, Uncharted’s plot is strangely stuck in the city and lacking in adventuring and exploration generally. Problems are solved too quickly, and we never truly get to know our main protagonist enough to root and love him as we did with good old Indy – or like we did for Nathan Drake in the videogames.
 It’s a pity that Uncharted’s writing gets in its own way since there are a few scenes where Holland’s acting talent shines through despite the script. Although he isn’t the Nathan we all know from the game series (sorry), there are a handful of engaging emotional breakthroughs in his performance that make you want to like him as a protagonist. Similarly, his on-screen banter with Wahlberg lands a handful of jokes and feels oddly charming, making these moments stand out as some of the most enjoyable in the movie.
 It is easy to see the actors’ effort in their performances as they try to push past the dull characters they have been given. It is also easy to see the editors’ extraordinary work in post-production for this film. I mean, come on, no one can deny that flying pirate ships are just cool. You have to give credit where credit is due, right?
 So to sum it all up, Uncharted looks great; its action scenes are exciting and fun. However, as much as it pains me to admit it, heart racing cinematography can only go so far, and unfortunately, this videogame adaptation just gets left in the dust. While it is full of promise and has the building blocks to be a solid feel-good action movie, Uncharted just misses the mark and couldn’t find the cinematic coordinates to land safely ashore.

"Jul 25, 2023",Uncharted fails to provide the most basic principles of an adventure movie&#46; It is underwhelming and overloaded&#44; without the charm of its clearly Spielberg-ian roots&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Dec 4, 2022",Uncharted heads into familiar action-adventure territory making for a forgettable video game adaptation&#46;,NEGATIVE
"Nov 5, 2022"," Yes, videogame adaptations very rarely ever work. Uncharted, however, has a built-in audience and a mainstream film fan premise that others did not have. Here, director Ruben Fleischer attempts to straighten out his R-rated career with an adventure film aimed at families to get back into theaters. (Strange for a family-friendly movie to have such a graphic throat-cutting scene, however). While his movie rarely veers away from the charted territory, the film has enough fun with itself for an enjoyable ride. The movie is about a couple of con artists who are hot on the trail of Ferdinand Magellan’s lost treasure. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is a young bartender who steals patrons’ valuable possessions while serving drinks. The other is Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). Sully watches Drake pull a diamond bracelet off a young woman by distracting her with the lighter his older brother gave him. Later, Drake finds Sully’s business card in his pocket, missing the jewelry. This is your basic start to any caper film. Think Ocean’s 11 where Danny Ocean stole Linus Caldwell’s score. Sully thinks Drake has a certain spidey-sense about him. He wants to recruit him to find that treasure. The key is stealing a gold cross being auctioned off. They don’t have the money to purchase such an item. Not to mention a ruthless millionaire. (This is where Col. Nathan R. Jessep would step into the scene and ask, “Is there another kind?”). His name is Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), and he has hired a cutthroat henchwoman named Braddock (You’s Tati Gabrielle). The ride is Chloe (Grey’s Anatomy’s Sophia Ali), another cross that completes the set. Together, they run across the globe fighting Moncada’s hired muscle and themselves.  Uncharted is a mix of a charismatic cast with evident chemistry between leads, classic tropes, and storytelling plotholes. The script has too many hands, going through multiple rewrites. It is remarkably diluted when it comes to details about the mystery to track the treasure. For instance, you don’t get the exciting history lesson like we would in Indiana Jones. Also, some of the adventures can be eye-roll-inducing. Do you mean to tell me there is a secret underground chamber that can be seen from a drainage grate that no one has thought to look at for the last 500 years? Not to mention, the big reveal has one of the characters needing to dive underwater to get a secret chamber, only for the bad guys to float in by boat? Yet, the entire movie can be a lot of fun. Holland and Wahlberg both have enough boyish charm — yes, even at the latter’s age — and buddy chemistry to keep things light throughout the adventure picture. Even Ali’s Chloe and Holland have an apparent heat on screen. However, what engages the viewer is the final’s act terrific, special effects-laden action sequence, resembling an old-fashioned swashbuckling ship battle. It’s surprisingly effective.  Uncharted does land the ship as a popcorn action-adventure picture designed to entertain so you can turn your brain off and enjoy the ride. For some, it may be familiar, charted territory. For me, I chose to power down and enjoy the ride despite the apparent flaws because it doesn’t pretend to be anything that it isn’t.  Marc Miller (also known as M.N. Miller) joined Ready Steady Cut in April 2018 as a Film and TV Critic, publishing over 1,600 articles on the website.

"Oct 12, 2022"," If you squint hard enough, you'll see what makes the actor great—charm, charisma, aw-shucks levels of approachability—but none of it saves the flick from being utterly forgettable.  This might be troubling news to you, having fallen from the back half of a pandemic time warp, but in May 2016, you likely first became aware of a kid named Tom Holland. Assuming a different name—Peter Parker, you've probably heard of him—Holland hopped onto movie screens everywhere in a Spider-Man costume and never left. That was nearly six years ago. Holland instantly charmed audiences with his boyish, pure-hearted take on the web-slinger, having a much easier go with the character than, say, the unfairly maligned (until recently) Andrew Garfield. On the side in the last half-decade, Holland has also starred in a couple of smaller films, always to a mixed reception—like Cherry and The Devil All the Time. Now, in 2022? The kid isn't a kid anymore. Holland has some killer curls and three solo Spider-Man flicks under his utility belt. The last one, No Way Home, is currently the sixth highest-grossing movie of all time. Not bad for 25! Considering that Holland has quickly become one of the biggest celebrities of his generation—running around wearing his very famous partner's name on the back of a Rangers jersey is probably helping!—his newest film, Uncharted, is suddenly a litmus test for his stardom. With his MCU trilogy wrapped and his personal life a tabloid fascination, where does his career go from here? Can he still, as they say, put butts in the (movie theater) seats? Debuting this past Thursday, Uncharted (based on the video game of the same name) is an Indiana Jones-esque adventure where Holland plays Nathan Drake, a sort of bland action-figure hero.  In other words? Holland doesn't have room to move. If you squint hard enough, you'll see what makes Holland great. When Drake finally makes buds with Mark Wahlberg's Sully, Holland's charisma comes back to life, his ribbing of Wahlberg (almost) making you want Uncharted 2. There's also a quasi-romantic thing going on with Drake and Sophia Taylor Ali's Chloe. His natural athleticism gets its moments too, and he still ducks and rolls and spins more convincingly than anyone you'll see in, say, a Jurassic Park romp nowadays.  But it takes too much effort, and ultimately, none of it can save the film. ",NEGATIVE
"Sep 10, 2022",Uncharted seems fresh in the era of superhero blockbusters&#46; Saying it&#8217;s not as great as one of the best video game series ever shouldn&#8217;t be a massive indictment as it&#8217;s a fun ride with a clear respect for the source material&#46;,POSITIVE
"Aug 26, 2022"," Beast – Idris Elba goes into the jungle with two daughters and Shallot Copley and ends up doing battle with a lion. What’s not to like? Seriously, this movie is very well made and it knows exactly what it was made to do, to thrill audiences. I went into the movie not knowing much other than that I was excited to watch Idris fight a lion, and while it delivered in that regard, it also shows what a good filmmaking team can do. This movie is directed by Baltasar Kormákur (director of the incredible Everest) and written by Ryan Engle, who wrote a little film called Rampage and clearly hasn’t met a creature feature he couldn’t write. Loved how Balthasar used long takes in this movie to both give the audience a mounting sense of dread but also the layout of various locations, establishing a visual identity and language to make the escapes all the more thrilling. The Long Hot Summer – Aaron Neuwirth inceptioned me into watching this after mentioning the Paul and Joanne doc on HBOMax inceptioned him into watching it. This movie is a really fascinating picture given that it came out the same year (the superior) Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and was likely made in response to the success of that play in the first place. We love a twin movie situation in Hollywood. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, even if the ending wrapped up a bit too 1950s for my taste. Paul Newman is very great and Joanne his equal match, although Orson Welles is prob the MVP of the film for sheer foolery he brings to the screen. I also loved how this was shot on location but you can tell certain scenes were shot on a studio. Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles – A genuine surprise. I enjoyed this film quite a bit and it has a really fun animation style. Prey – A thrilling watch, even if I will be annoyed forever how one character died. I will now wait patiently for the next Predator movie set in a bygone time period. 40 Years Young – A very cute romcom about a man who finds out that his son might not be his son and the journey of self-discovery it encourages. There’s also a cooking competition and hot people on the beach. A very fun and breezy Netflix film. Persuasion – As a noted Jane Austen fan, I am always here for a new interpretation of her work, be it modern or period. However, Persuasion never gets to truly take off because it is trying to be both modern and period. There is far too much winking towards the camera, I believe someone called it the Fleabagification of Jane Austen, and they’re right. I think I was truly lost in the language of the story, if we’re going to modernize why not go all the way? Instead the characters are stuck with half measure dialogue that doesn’t quite do Austen’s words justice and a script that doesn’t let its main character be as active in the story as one would like. Uncharted – A globe hopping adventure that manages to be visually boring and charm sucking. There are some talented actors in this and outside of Tati Gabrielle everyone is as flat as the camerawork and story. I need Hollywood to leave plane fights alone for a while (unless they’re Tom Cruise) because just like The Gray Man, some of the action beats are incomprehensible.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 23, 2022"," Uncharted opens with a terrific action scene in mid-air, spiked with signature Tom Holland humor and agility. It was even more exciting for me, because I saw it in the 4DX screening offered at YesPlanet Rishon, and the movement of my chair really did enhance the feeling of being right up there in the midst of it all (more on that later). The film, directed by Ruben Fleischer, is an adaptation of the eponymous PlayStation video game that features adventurer Nathan Drake. It’s a fun ride, and there’s a cool cameo for gamers to enjoy, but it is not quite the film I had hoped it would be. The film’s narrative is an origin story for the PlayStation game, with Tom Holland portraying a young Nathan Drake. A descendant of Sir Francis Drake, he grows up in an orphanage with his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow). Nate looks up to Sam, who regales him with tales of their pirate ancestry and the great explorers of the past, who sailed the world seeking treasure. Separated in childhood by a dramatic event, Nate’s only connection to his long-lost brother is through the postcards Sam sends from exotic locations. Young Nate learns to rely on his wits and agility, growing up to become a bartender, smooth-talker, and pickpocket. Treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) recruits him to locate the lost gold of Magellan. Obviously, they are not the only ones interested in the treasure, and there is a lively supporting cast that comes into play, including Antonio Banderas as Santiago Moncada, scion of a wealthy family once betrayed by Magellan, who is now out to reclaim what he feels is rightfully his. It also turns out that Sully has another partner, the alluring and capable Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). A past partner turned rival emerges in Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), who is now working for Moncada. And they all want the gold. Holland is fun as Nate, at once clever and yet retaining an aura of innocence. He even brings some nuance to his performance, as when he tries to bluff his way through a conversation with Moncada at an elegant auction, yet his eyes reveal his tension. However, the chemistry between the Nate and Sully never really takes off, the eventual bonding between the two is scripted, yet not convincing. Wahlberg seems rather bland in this role. In moments that would appear to require more emotional depth – it’s just not there. The rogue, devil-may-care, tough guy character is always more appealing when there’s a glimpse of his vulnerabilities. In contrast, the two supporting actors – Ali and Gabrielle – are vivid, powerful, and fun to watch. There’s palpable tension between Nate and Chloe (Ali), her open hostility and Nate’s complicated suspicion and attraction make their reluctant collaboration more interesting. They also have a terrific chase scene together. Jo Braddock (Gabrielle) exudes mystery and dominates the screen whenever she appears, yet I felt that both female characters were trapped in the over-familiar trope of “the beautiful woman who cannot be trusted.” Uncharted has had a long production history, first going into development in 2008. It went through several changes of directors before Ruben Fleischer took the helm in 2020, and several actors were considered for the role of Nate Drake. Mark Wahlberg was once a candidate, but as time went by, he aged out of the role and became the mentor rather than the young apprentice treasure hunter.  I suspect that this long process and several changes of key creatives contributed to make this film less than it might have been. There’s even a small moment that felt like a continuity hiccup to me when Nate guzzles down a glass of wine as if it was cheap beer, and Sully instructs him to savor it – odd behavior for someone who was mixing drinks as a bartender, Nate ought to know how to appreciate wine. Uncharted is a very mainstream action/adventure film, yet there is no character development that might have elicited deeper engagement from the viewer, not much real suspense, and certainly no surprises.  However, I did have a lot of fun watching it, and the 4DX experience at the cinema contributed enormously. Not recommended for the queasy, since the chairs do move, but the effects are meticulously planned and synchronized with the film to enhance the feeling of being in the midst of the action. The effects are felt throughout, some are subtle, and at other times – in the heavy action scenes – more rambunctious. It makes the experience of watching the film into a great ride, and perhaps that’s the best way to enjoy Uncharted.",NEGATIVE
"Aug 16, 2022"," There’s really no need to rehash the long and painful history of video game movies. For various reasons, video games just haven’t translated well to the big screen. At first, there wasn’t enough to the games to warrant a film version (movies like “Super Mario Bros” and “Street Fighter” are prime examples). These days video games offer more than enough content to fill a movie yet filmmakers still struggle to get them right. Now there’s a stigma attached and many critics are quick to dismiss any movie that carries the ‘video game adaptation’ tag. Yet these adaptations still keep coming. One reason is because video game developers have become incredible storytellers. Countless video games thrust their players into immersive narrative-driven experiences on par with all other story-based entertainment. These worlds, characters, relationships, and adventures offer plenty of big screen inspiration. It’s the execution part that trips filmmakers up. The latest game-to-movie adaptation is “Uncharted”, a sprawling action-adventure based on the Sony PlayStation franchise of the same name from game developer Naughty Dog. It’s helmed by Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”, “Venom”) who was handed a whopping $120 million budget from Sony Pictures to finally make a movie that’s been in various stages of development for 15 years. The game and now the movie’s chief protagonist is Nathan Drake, an ambitious treasure hunter and descendant of famed 16th century explorer Sir Francis Drake. Here, Nathan is played by Tom Holland who gives us a noticeably younger version of the character. He fits the story (penned by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway) even if not everything about his character makes sense. That’s because the movie rushes through his backstory, confining it to a brief prologue and a couple of exposition drops. That helps get right to the action, but it also leaves Nathan feeling a bit shallow. Getting by as a part-time bartender and a part-time pickpocket, Nathan’s true love is history. He learned it from his older brother Sam who took off 15 years earlier. Sam swore to come back and get Nathan but never did. I believe that’s meant to be a point of conflict within Nathan, but (as with so much of the movie) there’s very little time given to the emotions of the characters. I think Holland gets to shed a tear in one scene, but otherwise none of the characters ever get to convey any deeper feelings. One evening Nathan is approached by seasoned treasure hunter, Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) who tells him about the lost gold of explorer Ferdinand Magellan. Sully thinks he has found the key to discovering the gold’s location, but he needs Nathan’s help. Despite his love for history and his dreams of adventure, Nathan is reluctant to sign on. But when Sully mentions his past connections with Sam (who was also after Magellan’s loot) Nathan agrees to come, thinking if he finds the gold he may find his brother. Of course with such noteworthy treasure still undiscovered there are sure to be other parties on the hunt. Enter Santiago Moncada, a wealthy and quite ruthless Spaniard who has long had his sights on Magellan’s gold. He’s played by the always good but (here) woefully underutilized Antonio Banderas, who gets to do a little mustache twirling but never gets to fully extend himself as the antagonist. And there are other people in the mix including Moncada’s hired mercenary Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and Sully’s untrusting colleague Chloe (Sophia Ali). As the movie hops from New York to Barcelona to the Philippines, we get a couple of big set pieces, a few fight scenes, and lots of parkour. We get questions of loyalty as the old ‘honor among thieves’ mantra pops up again and again. And of course there are a handful of Easter eggs that people who haven’t played the game will never get –  a naughty dog decal stuck on a trunk, Nolan North (the voice actor who plays Nathan in the games) lounging on the beach, etc.  “Uncharted” really leans on its star power, especially Holland who plays a very Holland-like character – charismatic, boyishly charming, a bit daffy, and with an unshakable innocence (even when he tries to talk tough). Wahlberg is a sturdy fit for an otherwise one-dimensional role and Gabrielle has quite the screen presence. Unfortunately the story keeps them all tightly confined in their genre roles as the movie checks off the typical boxes. No one is allowed to really dig deeper into these characters. Still there’s enough entertainment packaged into this otherwise conventional action flick to offer a nice two-hour escape. Sadly, many critics will automatically lump “Uncharted” in with all the other video game movies. And they’ll examine it first and foremost through that particularly sour and jaded lens. So right out of the gate the movie is forced to tote baggage it shouldn’t have to. In reality, there’s nothing about “Uncharted” that screams “video game adaptation”. It’s an action-adventure movie that borrows more from Bond and “Raiders of the Lost Ark” than some video game movie formula. So with that said, how does “Uncharted” play as a MOVIE – no qualifiers or categories. In a nutshell, it does what it sets out to do. It’s entertaining enough with a couple of set pieces that really pop on the big screen. The banter between Holland and Wahlberg is fun although it does run its course. It’s all far-fetched and silly and relies on a lot of conveniences to propel its story forward. But whatever, “Uncharted” gets by and is worth a watch for genre fans and fans of the characters. It’s not a movie you’ll revisit over and over again, but it’s also not the train wreck some will be quick to label it as. “Uncharted” is now showing in theaters. I’m a huge fan of the Uncharted games, especially the 4th one.  It is the most cinematic of all of them.  You could stitch all the cutscenes together and it would rival most action adventure movies in terms of narrative, drama, and action.  It’s that good.  The movie, though?  I’m going to wait until it hits video before I check it out.  The more I hear about it, the less interested I am.  I want there to be a great movie based on a video game, and I don’t mean that ironically.  The problem is that movie studios are trying to appeal to both gamers and the general audience.  Gamers have a tendency to pick these movies apart rather mercilessly and general audiences aren’t necessarily familiar with these franchises.  It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone involved.  At least, in my opinion. Outside of the characters and the general vibe of the story, this one didn’t really feel super influenced by the game. As I mentioned, it feels like it takes just as much from “Raiders” and Bond than the Uncharted games. I have no interest in this.  It looks so generic and I’m starting to think Mark Wahlberg is starting to regress more as an actor where he’s kind of just doing the same thing. To be honest, other than a couple of good set pieces it is fairly generic. Wahlberg’s pretty good in it. But you’re right, it’s a character type he’s done several times before.",NEUTRAL

Spider-Man: No Way Home, starring Tom Holland, recently took the sixth spot at all-time box office take, hitting $1.8 billion internationally in ticket sales. While Avatar may be unbeatable with $2.8 billion in ticket sales, that James Cameron film wasn't released in the middle of a global pandemic.  The 6pm opening night session of Holland's latest, Uncharted, was a full house in the biggest theatre of the suburban cinema near my home, which makes me wonder if the personable young British actor might be personally responsible for the salvation of movie cinemas in the difficult transition back to live venues for audiences used to two years of sitting on the couch. For grown-ups without young people or PlayStations in their homes, the source material for Uncharted is a series of ridiculously well-selling first-person action games, a kind of Tomb Raider for boys.  The audience in my cinema were obviously fans, with a few gasps of recognition for characters or storylines from the games, the biggest of which was the real-life appearance of one of the game's voice actors.  Given this is an action film with a built-in fan base, an enormous budget, and two of cinema's hottest stars, both noted for their comedy work, the filmmakers have really missed that secret ingredient that keeps audiences coming back for more.  As the film opens, we meet Nathan Drake (Holland) as he is hanging from the back of a plane, fighting off some guys we assume are bad. Backing up a few weeks, Drake is approached at the bar he works at by Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) offering him a job that promises to utilise his skills as a thief and as an expert in lost treasure.  That's an oddly specific set of skills for a bartender to wield, but Sully knows of Drake's obsession, since childhood, with the supposed missing gold treasure carried on Ferdinand Magellan's ships.  Sully is a nice older action role for the gracefully ageing Mark Wahlberg, and with this film set up as a prequel to the games there are perhaps many more years' work for both stars here. How Sully knows this will become apparent in time, but standing between the two chaps and the treasure are a series of obstacles, human and otherwise.  Among these are billionaire treasure obsessive Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his hench-woman Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and aggressive Aussie Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), rival fortune hunter.  Within days he finds himself in Barcelona and the Philippines, hot on the trail of the fortune, and hanging off the back of a plane.  Some of the more impressive set pieces from a few of the Uncharted games are sifted together into the screenplay by Art Marcum, Rafe Judkins and Matt Holloway.  These chaps have penned screenplays for Iron Man and the TV series Chuck and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, all of which get that right tone of humour in an action setting.  Director Reuben Fleischer of Zombieland fame does good work in the action sequences, though some of the scenes in between could do with a trim.  Often a video game adaptation film will suffer for trying to build too much of the game's action - climbing, grunting, parkour, running along rooftops - to the detriment of the story.  The film's secret weapon is Tom Holland's natural athleticism, though I'm sure he's too expensive a star to risk and so possibly the stunt team deserve equal praise. Sully is a nice older action role for the gracefully ageing Mark Wahlberg, and with this film set up as a prequel to the games there are perhaps many more years' work for both stars here.  American actress Sophia Ali sports a decent Aussie accent, which exists only because the character in the game is voiced by our own Claudia Black. ",NEUTRAL
"Aug 9, 2022"," Almost all videogame movies are crap, goes the general sentiment. Since the early 1990s popular cinema has been littered with the corpses of failed blockbusters, murdered by audiences after being poorly equipped and armed by numerous production companies, studios, and producers. From Super Mario Bros in 1993 to Resident Evil Afterlife in 2010, critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave videogame movies an average score of 16 per cent. Things have improved in the last decade or so. In part, videogame movies honestly seem to be getting better. It is also thanks to videogames embracing narrative in much more sophisticated ways, and thus providing more complex source material for the films. Videogames have, more or less, gradually become more cinematic. It’s that specific trend that has brought us to Uncharted. It is a Sony franchise of action games – four to date, released between 2007 and 2017 – that actively imitate their feature film equivalents. They boast complex, movie-like action sequences and chase scenes. They feature engaging characters with extensive vocal and motion-captured performances by professional actors. The dialogue is as snappy and amusing as any theatrical tentpole. With videogame movies showing more and more success – Rampage (2018), Detective Pikachu (2019), Sonic the Hedgehog (2020), and Mortal Kombat (2021) have all found commercial audiences – it absolutely makes sense for Sony to adapt their own videogame into an all-new feature film. It is important to stress that Ruben Fleischer’s film of Uncharted is a servicable work. Tom Holland plays professional thief Nathan “Nate” Drake who, on the promise of finding his missing brother, teams up with treasure hunter Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to track down the lost gold of Ferdinand Magellan. On the way they come up against rival thief Chloe Frazer (Sophia Taylor Ali), rich dilletante Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), and the lethal mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). The film is a stock standard treasure hunt: the protagonists follow a trail of clues around the world that should eventually lead them to their prize. It is a well-worn genre convention, one peppered with a variety of action scenes, and situates Uncharted in a familiar echelon of semi-standard action vehicles including National Treasure (2004), Angels & Demons (2009), and any number of Tomb Raider adaptations (2001, 2003, 2018). None of these are bad films, but neither are they memorable ones. They do their job sufficiently but not tremendously. They are cookie-cutter time-fillers for which the description “oh, it’s fine” seems purposefully created. If you are after a relatively generic action-adventure, Uncharted probably fits the bill – although a Marvel-like reliance on digital effects does let down its larger action sequences. Here is the underlying problem. Uncharted the film is okay, but Uncharted the game franchise is great. Really quite genuinely and remarkably great. It is the tightest fusion of game and feature film the global entertainment industry has accomplished. Games have pushed narratives for some decades now, usually in a blend of non-interactive cut scene, followed by gameplay, then another cut scene, then gameplay, and so on. Beginning with the second game in particular, Uncharted simply blended the two. Characters would talk and advance the plot while the player engaged with the game. Cut scenes and gameplay blended into one another. The dialogue was Hollywood-quality and well-performed, and the key action sequences were wonderfully sophisticated and jaw-dropping their ambition. They remain to date, at least in my opinion, the closest that games have come to being playable movies. This is the core of the film Uncharted‘s failure. As a film in general it is perfectly watchable, if perfunctory. Specifically as a film of Uncharted it is simply not as good as Uncharted already is. Many fans and critics have judged it as a bad movie, but honestly it is worse than that: it’s a redundant one. In theatres it made a profit, so it is likely that Sony will push for a sequel. Next time around, however, they really need to try harder. Either that, or just let the audience play the next one on Playstation 5 instead.",NEUTRAL
"Jul 11, 2022"," Dentro del debate por el mérito artístico que puede llegar a tener un videojuego los de Uncharted nunca se han llevado más palma que por sus logros técnicos, como la animación con captura de movimiento o la puesta en escena cinematográfica. Esencialmente cada juego es su propia película y la creación de cada uno representa un desafío a los límites de la tecnología para volverlos un poco más cinemáticos. Lo mismo no puede decirse del film de Ruben Fleischer, un producto hecho sin inspiración y con el menor esfuerzo que piensa que devolver la liebre a la galera es un truco tan asombroso como sacarla en primer lugar. Le pusieron de subtítulo “Fuera del Mapa”, pero Uncharted (2022) no explora territorio nuevo. La historia es una simple búsqueda de tesoro alrededor del mundo. Los juegos nunca necesitaron mucho más que eso porque cuentan con personajes simpáticos que se relacionan con ingenio y dinamismo humano. Nada más lejos de ellos que Tom Holland y Mark Wahlberg en los papeles del joven aventurero Nathan Drake y su mentor Victor Sullivan. La relación que debería ser el corazón de la historia pende de una química tan fría y forzada que a menudo los actores ni parecen estar compartiendo la misma escena (y probablemente fue el caso en varias). Holland, siempre tímido y compungido, no da la talla de un aventurero chapado a lo Indiana Jones y un desganado Wahlberg brinda su típica mezcla de agresión y pasividad a un papel que no tiene nada que ver con la figura cálida y paternal de Sully. El tesoro en cuestión es el botín perdido de Fernando de Magallanes. Suena mucho menos emocionante que descubrir El Dorado o la mítica Shambhala porque no hay ningún misterio que revelar ni elemento sobrenatural con el que decorar la trama. Como la mayoría de las decisiones creativas de la película, parece haber sido tomada por descarte. Hay alusiones y referencias a todos los juegos de la serie, incluyendo un simpático cameo, pero ha elegido como compás principal el cuarto y más prosaico de los juegos. El único casting acertado del film es Sophia Ali en el papel de la aventurera rival Chloe Frazer. Antonio Banderas interpreta al villano de turno Santiago Moncada y se roba sus escenas. Su papel termina siendo decepcionantemente menor pero es uno de esos donde el actor comparte con la audiencia cuánto se está divirtiendo. Dentro del tibio caldo de deepfakes y pantalla verde que componen el entretenimiento principal de la película hay muy pocos momentos memorablemente divertidos, salvo por los más estúpidos, y esos es mejor olvidar. Uncharted es un excelente telefilm digno de Nickelodeon que promete entretener sin emocionar demasiado con su violencia sanitizada, humor desdentado, tediosa asexualidad y falta de imaginación. Es el Indiana Jones que le toca al 2022. Los juegos son más divertidos. ",NEUTRAL
"Jun 25, 2022"," Some movies sport monikers so out of sync with their contents that someone really should've had a rethink before they reached screens. Uncharted is one of them, but it was never going to switch its name. The action-adventure flick comes to cinemas following a decade and a half of trying, after the first Uncharted video game reached consoles in 2007 and the journey to turning it into a movie began the year after. Accordingly, this Tom Holland (Spider-Man: No Way Home)- and Mark Wahlberg (Joe Bell)-starring film was fated to keep its franchise's title, which references its globe-trotting, treasure hunting, dark passageway-crawling, dusty map-coveting storyline. But unexplored, unfamiliar and undiscovered, this terrain definitely isn't — as four Indiana Jones films to-date, two National Treasure flicks, three Tomb Raider movies, 80s duo Romancing the Stone and The Jewel of the Nile, and theme park ride-to-screen adaptation Jungle Cruise have already demonstrated. Uncharted mightn't live up to its label, but it is something perhaps unanticipated given its lengthy production history — a past that's seen six other filmmakers set to direct it before the Zombieland movies' Ruben Fleischer actually did the honours, plenty of screenwriters come and go, and Wahlberg once floated to play the saga's hero Nathan Drake rather than the mentor role of Victor Sullivan he has now. That surprise? Uncharted is fine enough, which might be the best likely possible outcome that anyone involved could've hoped for. It's almost ridiculously generic, and it sails in the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks' slipstream as well, while also cribbing from The Mummy, Jumanji and even the Ocean's films. Indeed, it borrows from other movies as liberally as most of its characters pilfer in their daily lives, even nodding towards all things Fast and Furious. It's no worse than the most generic of its predecessors, though — which isn't the same as striking big-screen gold, but is still passable. The reasons that Uncharted just hits the barest of marks it needs to are simple and straightforward: it benefits from Holland's charms, its climax is a glorious action-film spectacle, and it doesn't ever attempt to be anything it's not (although reading a statement of intent into the latter would be being too generous). It also zips through its 116-minute running time, knowing that lingering too long in any one spot wouldn't serve it well — and it's as good as it was going to be given the evident lack of effort to be something more. While you can't make a great movie out of these very minor wins, they're all still noticeable pointers in an okay-enough direction. Getting audiences puzzling along with it, delivering narrative surprises even to viewers wholly unfamiliar with the games, asking Wahlberg to do anything more than his familiar tough-guy schtick, making the most of the bulk of its setpieces, providing the product of more than just-competent direction: alas, none of these turn out.  In a film that acts as a prequel to its button-mashing counterparts, Holland plays Drake as a 20-something with brother issues, a vast knowledge of cocktail histories that's handy for his bartending gig, an obsession with 16th-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and the gold he might've hidden, and very light fingers. Nate's elder sibling dipped out of his life after the pair were caught trying to steal a Magellan map as orphanage-dwelling kids, in fact, which Sully uses to his advantage when he first crosses his path in a New York bar — and, after some convincing, Nate has soon signed up to finish the quest he's been dreaming about since childhood. Naturally, this newly formed duo aren't the only ones on the Magellan treasure's trail. The wealthy Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard) is descended from the explorer's original financiers and boasts a hefty sense of entitlement, while knife-wielding mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, You) and enterprising fortune-hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, India Sweets and Spices) are each chasing a windfall. It's telling — and farcically blatant — that Uncharted begins with Nate hanging upside down. He's suspended from a train of freight trailing out of a plane, but the visual message is instant and obvious: yes, Holland also plays Spider-Man. Actually, the film doesn't ever ask him to stretch his talents beyond everything he's already immensely famous for, going for a 'Peter Parker, but make him a thief with a heart of gold' setup. Still, he's as entertaining and charismatic as the part demands, and lifts the routine script by The Wheel of Time's Rafe Lee Judkins and Men in Black: International duo Art Marcum and Matt Holloway purely by his presence. Holland hasn't had a great time of late beyond the Marvel web, with the also long-troubled Chaos Walking proving flat-out awful, and Cherry failing to set streaming alight; however, if Uncharted leaves a lasting imprint, it's wondering how much better its star could fare with if he had more than a by-the-numbers screenplay to work with. A worthy lead, underperforming material, a general unwillingness to take any risks: that's a problem that's plagued too many movies about too many connect-the-dots treasure hunts well before now. Thankfully, Uncharted's eagerness to just get on with its story helps significantly — breezing by rather than loitering on its chest of illogical twists and turns, and, Wahlberg aside, never giving its one-note supporting characters too much of the spotlight. Also, when that aforementioned eye-catching finale arrives and puts the whole archaeology-meets-swashbuckling idea to nice use, the picture almost justifies its existence. X doesn't ever quite mark the spot with Uncharted, and the history of bringing video games to the movies still sinks more often than it swims, but there's just enough that gleams here to be watchable. It's a film with a few shiny coins in its bag, rather than a whole bar, cavern or ship of riches.",POSITIVE
"Jun 10, 2022"," ollywood may have mastered the art of storytelling in pretty much every genre but making a solid video game adaptation is a skill that still seems to elude the world’s most successful film industry. The last few years have seen a couple of amicable releases – primarily in the shape of the big screen ventures of Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog – but, by and large, video game movies have been mediocre at best and inept at worst. The latest adaptation to join the mediocre camp is Uncharted, the long-delayed action-adventure based on the popular Naughty Dog video game franchise. The always-charming Tom Holland stars as Nathan Drake, a street-smart pickpocket who grew up sharing his now-missing brother Sam’s fascination with the 16th century Magellan expedition. When Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) – a fortune hunter who worked with Sam tracking the fabled treasure hidden by the Magellan crew – shows up and asks the protagonist for his help finding the mythical gold, Nathan agrees to join the quest in the hopes of being reunited with his brother. But he soon realizes that the mission is even trickier than he imagined. Not only does he not know whom he can trust, but he must also race against corrupt billionaire Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and mercenary leader Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) who are trying to locate the same treasure as well. Uncharted plays out like a very middle-of-the-road treasure hunt movie which emulates the likes of Indiana Jones and National Treasure and comes off as an uninventive re-tread. While the action is in Holland’s very capable hands, the plot doesn’t really take the characters to any unexpected grounds or do anything truly memorable with the storyline.  Uncharted is, all in all, too bland to really make a mark. If you were hoping to watch a film that finally proves video game movies can actually be good, then Uncharted isn’t it. Fans of the franchise who already feel a connection with the material are likely to appreciate this project more than the rest of us, and if you go in with low expectations and a strong determination to be entertained, then the film will deliver a fun diversion. Had the action come with some emotional weight and the script been better though, the adventure could have been significantly more enjoyable.",NEUTRAL

"May 21, 2022"," BELLE (2021). Given the stateside title of Belle (in its native Japan, it’s called The Dragon and the Freckled Princess) and a plot involving a fierce yet sensitive beast and the beauty who loves him, it’s not hard to dig up this animated film’s roots. But while taking a central idea from the classic fairy tale (and with a special emphasis on Disney’s toon version), this imaginative piece from writer-director Mamoru Hosoda (the Oscar-nominated Mirai) is very much its own, uh, beast. Suzu is an insecure teenage girl who, prodded by her best friend, creates an online character in a virtual world known as “U.” Suzu’s alter ego Belle is a singing sensation who attracts a record number of followers, but her mixed feelings about her newfound (albeit anonymous) success temporarily get shelved after she encounters an intimidating creature known as The Dragon. Belle runs just over two hours, and its length is felt in several lighter sequences that keep the story needlessly idling. But the film’s weightier moments make an impact, whether it’s the tragic opening, the anti-bullying stance, or the surprising turn that takes the movie in an unexpected direction. BEVERLY HILLS COP II (1987). Even before Beverly Hills Cop was released in December 1984, there was chatter at Paramount about a sequel — a no-brainer given the amount of money Eddie Murphy had already made for the studio with 1982’s 48 Hrs. and 1983’s Trading Places. Yet Beverly Hills Cop II proved to be a massive disappointment, little more than a sleazy, sexist, and stupid follow-up. (And while a hit with $153 million, that was no match for the staggering $234 million gross of the exciting original.) This one finds Detroit cop Axel Foley (Murphy) returning to sunny California to help his detective buddies Rosewood (Judge Reinhold) and Taggart (John Ashton) discover who shot Captain Bogomil (Ronny Cox). Aside from Ashton’s Taggart, the characters here are nothing like their interpretations in the first film (Rosewood, for instance, is one step away from being a psychotic militia man), and the villains (played by Jürgen Prochnow, Dean Stockwell, and a wooden Brigitte Nielsen) are a particularly dull assemblage. Gilbert Gottfried (RIP) appears in one funny scene as an excitable accountant. This earned an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song (Bob Seger’s “Shakedown”). CINDERELLA (1977). In a View From the Couch column earlier this year, I noted that Michael Pataki, a workaholic actor known for credits as varied as Rocky IV, Airport ’77, and Zoltan … Hound of Dracula, only directed two movies over the course of his lengthy career. One was the 1976 horror yarn Mansion of the Doomed; the other was this softcore version of the classic fairy tale, advertised with the line, “What The Prince Slipped Cinderella Was Not A Slipper.” I had caught this on videocassette while in college back in the ‘80s and found it moderately enjoyable; to my surprise, that’s the same diagnosis it’s receiving from my recent viewing. The story is basically the same — poor Cinderella (Cheryl “Rainbeaux” Smith) lives with her wicked stepmother (Jennifer Stace) and hideous stepsisters (Yana Nirvana and Marilyn Corwin) — except here the fairy godmother is a black homosexual (scene-stealing Sy Richardson, later a regular in Alex Cox films like Repo Man and Sid & Nancy) and the climactic (in more ways than one) ball is a full-blown orgy. There are plenty of musical numbers, plenty of bawdy gags, and plenty of nekkid bods of all shapes and sizes. INFINITE (2021). Mark Wahlberg and director Antoine Fuqua, who had previously worked together on 2007’s Shooter, only shoot themselves in the feet with Infinite, one of those grueling efforts that renders the science fiction genre about as much fun as a root canal sans anesthetics. The notion of past lives is the hook, with those who recall their previous existences known as Infinites. The Infinites are divided into two groups: the Believers, who view their memories as cherished gifts and want to serve humankind, and the Nihilists, who despise their total recall and figure the best way to end their cerebral callbacks is (to paraphrase Jackie Brown) to absolutely, positively kill every motherfucker in the world. So both factions find themselves pursuing the Egg, a thingamajig that can destroy the world (or at least scramble or fry it). As in Transformers: The Last Knight, it’s determined that Mark Wahlberg is humanity’s last great hope — a terrifying concept no matter how it’s sliced. Wahlberg’s Evan McCauley doesn’t recall his rich past(s), so it’s up to the Believers to jog his memory so they can prevail against the Nihilists. Take my advice regarding this dopey film and fuhgeddaboudit. LICORICE PIZZA (2021). Writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s ninth feature film has been wildly overpraised in some circles, considering it’s really not much better (but certainly no worse) than the zillion “coming of age” tales that preceded it. It also stands as PTA’s most conventional work to date, possessing little of the blazing originality found in the likes of Boogie Nights, Punch-Drunk Love, and the criminally overlooked Hard Eight. Its insular nature is part of the problem — whereas the best films of this sort generally allow their youthful characters to register as Everyteen by tapping into universal triumphs and travails, feelings and frustrations, this one is specific to a fault. Set in 1973 San Fernando Valley, it focuses on the will-they-or-won’t-they relationship between a 25-year-old woman (Alana Haim) and the 15-year-old boy (Cooper Hoffman, Philip Seymour’s son) who adores her. Licorice Pizza is sweet and sentimental, with one great performance (Bradley Cooper is terrific playing real-life producer Jon Peters as possibly insane), but, unlike its Valley setting, it contains few peaks. This earned Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962). Merely one of the greatest Westerns ever made, this John Ford masterpiece is notable for (among other attributes) the immortal line, “When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.” James Stewart (top-billed in all the promotional material) and John Wayne (top-billed in the on-screen credits) play polar opposites of the type of men seeking to tame the West, and it’s their relationship — and the events that forge it — that allows the movie to emerge as one of the first to question the tendency to mythologize the Wild West (a theme also featured in such latter-day classics as Arthur Penn’s Little Big Man and Clint Eastwood’s Unforgiven). Stewart plays the civilized tenderfoot lawyer trying to hold his own, Wayne is the macho gunslinger who occasionally helps out, and Lee Marvin provides gritty villainy as the sadistic Liberty Valance. Costume designer Edith Head landed an Oscar nomination for her Western duds. The latest release in the Paramount Presents series, this one offers both 4K and Blu-ray discs. Extras include audio commentary by filmmaker and historian Peter Bogdanovich, featuring his archival recordings with Ford and Stewart; a retrospective making-of piece; and a discussion of the film with critic Leonard Maltin. UNCHARTED (2022). Given the sorry history of movies based on video games — there’s last year’s rollicking Werewolves Within and then there’s everything else — Uncharted is probably better than it had any right to be. It falls into that “S’OK” middle ground also occupied by Tomb Raider (the Alicia Vikander version) and Pokémon Detective Pikachu: None are quite recommendable, but all offer something of value to mentally coasting viewers. In Uncharted, it’s a lengthy and large-scale set-piece involving an airplane, unsecured cargo, and hapless humans playing what can be described as a life-or-death version of dodgeball. The rest is the usual pablum involving characters searching for long-buried treasure and viewers searching for anything that would set it apart from, say, the National Treasure flicks or Jungle Cruise. Neither Tom Holland nor Mark Wahlberg are entirely convincing as swashbuckling types, although Holland’s effortless charisma carries him a long way; there’s also a hissable villain (Antonio Banderas), a colleague (Sophia Ali) who wavers between possible romantic interest and potentially dangerous betrayer, and a pair of Marvel-like end credit scenes meant to jump-start the project’s franchise possibilities.",POSITIVE

"May 18, 2022"," Uncharted, fuera del mapa (Uncharted, EE.UU./ 2022). Dirección: Ruben Fleischer. Guion: Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway. Fotografía: Chung-hoon Chung. Elenco: Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, Antonio Banderas, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle. Calificación: . Duración: 116 minutos. Distribuidora: UIP. Calificación: apta para mayores de 13 años. Nuestra opinión: buena. “¿Cuando supiste que querías ser Indiana Jones?”, le pregunta Nate Drake a Chloe Frazer, en una escena de Uncharted, fuera del mapa. La mención al arqueólogo más famoso de la historia del cine llega justo en el momento en el que muchos espectadores estarán pensando cuanto les recuerda esa secuencia a Indiana Jones y la última cruzada. Nombrarlo es una forma de decirle al público que la referencia es voluntaria y con el debido crédito reconocido; un homenaje, no una copia. Y, sí, las virtudes de Uncharted, fuera del mapa son lecciones aprendidas de las películas de Indiana Jones. Un protagonista encantador, con un interés por la historia y aptitudes para la aventura que vienen desde chico; una tensa pero cómica relación de “padre e hijo”; la mezcla de datos históricos con fantasías clásicas de tesoros perdidos; el humor constantemente colándose en la aventura. Hasta la decisión de empezar la película en medio de una secuencia de acción, en la que el protagonista corre un peligro extremo (ok, eso se lo “robó” Indiana Jones a James Bond). Claro que Uncharted, fuera del mapa tiene otra fuente de inspiración más directa, el videojuego homónimo, que tiene como protagonista a Nate Drake, interpretado en el film por Tom Holland, aprovechando al máximo su encanto arrollador. Luego de dejar en suspenso la suerte de Nate en la primera secuencia, la película de Ruben Fleischer muestra el origen de la obsesión del muchacho con el supuesto tesoro perdido de Magallanes, una historia que le cuenta su hermano mayor y compañero de aventuras. Ya en la actualidad, con su hermano perdido desde hace tiempo, Nate conoce a Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), con quien se asocia para encontrar al tesoro y averiguar qué le sucedió a su hermano. En el camino, tienen que lidiar con otras personas que quieren lo mismo que ellos: Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), quien puede ser una socia confiable o no; Braddock, una temible mujer que amenaza los planes de Nate y Sully; y Santiago Moncada, interpretado por Antonio Banderas, un millonario dispuesto a todo para encontrar el tesoro que considera que le pertenece a su familia. Algo de las relaciones familiares sustitutas y la desconfianza que aparecían en otra película de Fleischer, Zombieland, están presentes aquí. La dinámica del trío formado por Nate, Sully y Chloe es divertida, como también lo es la de Nate y Sully en un principio. Pero los caminos por los que lleva la trama a los personajes dinamitan esa fortaleza y la película sufre por eso en el último acto. Lo construido en la primera parte se diluye en ese último trama debido a lo que sucede con los personajes, pero también por el exceso de CGI y escenas de acción que no logran transmitir una sensación de peligro real. El sentido del espectáculo propio del cine mainstream actual está lejos de aquellas puestas en escena diseñadas como un juego entre el suspenso y la sorpresa, que mantenían al espectador en vilo. Al final, la referencia a Indiana Jones se queda en eso y Uncharted, fuera del mapa termina siendo una película que entretiene pero también decepciona. © Copyright 2024 SA LA NACION | Todos los derechos reservados.

"May 16, 2022"," Han pasado quince años desde que su hermano mayor Sam se fue, pero Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) sigue pensando en él a menudo, sobre todo, porque Sam ha desaparecido y nadie sabe dónde está. El propio Nathan trabaja ahora en un bar donde le gusta robar a la clientela rica sin que se den cuenta. Sin embargo, el cazador de tesoros Victor 'Sully’ Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) es consciente de este talento; es más, quiere utilizarlo para sí mismo. Más concretamente, convence al talentoso ladrón de poca monta para que le ayude a robar una cruz de oro, la llave de un enorme tesoro. A cambio, Nathan podría volver a ver a Sam, con quien Sully ha estado trabajando. Pero otros también van detrás del tesoro. Está el rico heredero Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) y su gélida asesina Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) y Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), una cazadora de tesoros, también está al acecho. Videojuegos y cine: esta ha sido una relación larga, a veces muy lucrativa y, sin embargo, a menudo frustrante. Como es sabido, no han faltado los intentos de adaptar plantillas conocidas a la gran pantalla. Pero muy pocos son realmente convincentes. Recientemente, grandes nombres como Mortal Kombat, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City y Monster Hunter han decepcionado. Por lo tanto, las expectativas para Uncharted no habrían sido especialmente altas incluso en circunstancias normales, simplemente por las malas experiencias y las circunstancias no eran normales. La adaptación llevaba en marcha desde 2008, el equipo fue sustituido cada pocos años, el proverbial infierno del desarrollo. Y cuando finalmente se concretó, el casting causó polémica. ¿Tom Holland y Mark Wahlberg? De verdad. Puedes poner un pequeño signo de interrogación detrás de las decisiones. Desde un punto de vista comercial son bastante comprensibles, después de todo son dos de los actores más conocidos del momento. Y eso es necesario para atraer a un público más allá de la base de fans y así hacer que la película sea rentable. Además, Holland tiene las acrobacias necesarias para no parecer completamente fuera de lugar en las diversas escenas de aventura. Pero en términos de edad, simplemente no encaja en relación con los juegos. Aunque se supone que la película Uncharted es una precuela que cuenta la historia de Nathan y Sully conociéndose, es un poco extraño. También parece que a Wahlberg le cuesta un poco ser el segundo plato y el mentor aquí, no se ajusta a la imagen del héroe alfa. Por lo demás, ya se ha hecho mucho para que el público del juego se sienta como en casa. No sólo los tres personajes principales están tomados de la serie lanzada en 2007, también hay algunas alusiones en la película. Pero no es necesario conocer los originales. La ventaja de una precuela es que realmente se puede empezar desde el principio y llevar a todos los que van al cine. De este modo, Uncharted no sólo se dirige a los fans actuales, sino también a los espectadores que quieren volver a ver una aventura clásica. Al fin y al cabo, este tipo de aventuras se han vuelto muy raras. Con Jungle Cruise el año pasado se lanzó una edición de gran presupuesto. Pero estaba más orientado al humor, con una historia de amor un poco cursi hacia el final. Con Uncharted tampoco hay que temer, el humor aquí está sólo en las discusiones entre los personajes, no los hay exagerados como en el colega de arriba. E incluso si Chloe funciona naturalmente como el interés amoroso de Nathan, esto es siempre sólo un efecto secundario, no el foco. Obviamente querían tomarse un poco de tiempo aquí. Tiene que quedar un poco para las posibles secuelas; eso suena bien en un principio. Pero también significa que apenas hay nada en la película que merezca la pena mencionar, ni positivo ni negativo. No hay ningún motivo real de fastidio, lo que no es de recibo en una adaptación de un videojuego y tampoco hay motivos de alegría. Sin duda, argumentalmente Uncharted es un gran despropósito, en el que personajes planos se ven envueltos en situaciones constantemente y tienen que resolver puzles poco originales. Sin embargo, con un poco de buena voluntad, la adaptación del videojuego, puede ser considerada un placer culpable. Es una extravagancia en la pantalla que es divertida a su manera banal y absurda. La mezcla de puzles, escaramuzas de diálogo más o menos divertidas, estímulos visuales y secuencias de acción enérgica no produce tiempos muertos y, si lo que quieres es desconectar la cabeza en el cine, cumple su propósito. La película, dirigida por Ruben Fleischer (Venom), desprende encanto sobre todo gracias al actor principal Tom Holland. Al igual que en sus apariciones como Spider-Man, da a su papel un toque simpático y travieso. Nate puede tener tendencias criminales. Aquí y allá deberías leerle el acta de motín. Sin embargo, nunca se puede estar realmente enfadado con el joven e históricamente versado Indiana Jones. Con Mark Wahlberg, Holland tiene un sólido compañero de juego que puede dar algunos golpes útiles. Chloe y Braddock no son, ni mucho menos, polifacéticas, pero no entran en la categoría de ‘dadores de pistas pasivos’ que se nos presenta con demasiada frecuencia hoy en día. Sin embargo, precisamente porque Sophia Ali y Tati Gabrielle dan a sus personajes más de lo que el guión proporciona, es una pena que la primera desaparezca de repente de la escena en el final. Aquí, el campo pertenece claramente a los maestros de la creación, lo que contrarresta en cierto modo la anterior interacción ojo a ojo. La aventura también parece igualmente indecisa en otro aspecto: una visión autocrítica de la herencia colonial emerge brevemente a través del padre del villano Banderas. Sin embargo, Nate, Victor y Chloe no se cuestionan ni un ápice la procedencia del oro que persiguen con tanto ahínco. El blockbuster de Hollywood sacrifica voluntariamente la posibilidad de un matiz narrativo diferenciado por el factor diversión. Fleischer en resumen ha presentado una obra que, aparte de los grandes nombres -tanto del juego como del reparto-, carece por completo de identidad. En los últimos años, se ha acusado repetidamente a las películas de ser el resultado de un algoritmo y no de un proceso creativo, lo mismo ocurre con Uncharted. De vez en cuando es agradable recordar los clásicos de aquí, cuando el género de las aventuras todavía era relevante para los éxitos de taquilla. Indiana Jones, en particular, se presta a la comparación. Sin embargo, al mismo tiempo, también deja claro lo aburrido que se ha vuelto el legado en última instancia. Todo parece bastante pasable y hay lugares hermosos para olvidar la vida cotidiana. Pero la película se olvida igual de rápido después. La historia no es la catástrofe que temíamos. Pero la larga espera apenas mereció la pena. Rubén Peralta Rigaud nació en Santo Domingo en 1980.

"May 13, 2022"," Durante el tiempo que dura la película Uncharted: Fuera del mapa, es sencillo dejarse llevar. Hay risas y suspiros de asombro, pero cuando las luces de la sala se encienden nos damos cuenta de que algo nos falta. Debajo de toda la parafernalia –como las impresionantes secuencias de acción o efectos visuales que quitan el aliento–, la estructura de confianza de los grandes estudios permanece intacta. Conocemos a Nathan “Nate” Drake (Tom Holland), un joven que trabaja como bartender, pero sueña con ser un explorador destacado, como su hermano mayor Sam, a quien dejó de ver a temprana edad, cuando éste escapó del orfanato en el que ambos vivían. Los años pasan y Nate recibe la visita de Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), un cazatesoros que le ofrece al chico la oportunidad de participar en la búsqueda de un mítico botín y, si el destino así lo quiere, de reencontrarse con su pariente. En el transcurso de la cacería, se asocian con la audaz exploradora Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) para sortear los obstáculos impuestos por el millonario Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) y la mercenaria Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), quienes también desean encontrar la fortuna. ¿Quién llegará primero al destino? Estamos ante una adaptación de la popular franquicia de videojuegos del mismo nombre lanzada por la desarrolladora Naughty Dog en 2007. Es preciso hacer hincapié en que, en este caso en particular, es bastante evidente que las historias de los juegos, literalmente, se adaptaron para la pantalla grande, a un formato que se podría describir como “amigable” o “accesible” para quienes no están familiarizados con la franquicia que comenzó en las consolas. Así, en un intento por apelar a todo tipo de público, se nos presentan versiones menos maduras de los personajes. Drake apenas se enfrenta a su primera travesía y no tiene el mismo nivel de experiencia que su contraparte en bits. Por su parte, Sully se muestra mucho más fresco y jovial. Aunque se podría pensar que éste cambio resultaría poco atractivo, sobre todo cuando ya estaba establecido un canon alternativo, la realidad es que el ajuste para el ámbito fílmico funciona a la perfección. Al establecer desde el inicio que los protagonistas no serán meras copias de lo que se conocía previamente, se vuelve más sencillo conectar con la hilarante química que se forma entre el ensamble, en especial Holland y Wahlberg. Banderas y Gabrielle ofrecen sólidos antagónicos. El andaluz se desenvuelve con una energía un tanto neurótica y sobreactuada que, en manos de otro, se sentiría fuera de lugar, pero él logra el balance perfecto entre el absurdo y la seriedad; La californiana –a quien se agradece ver en un proyecto para cine después de su magnífica interpretación de Prudence en El mundo oculto de Sabrina (2018-2020)– demuestra que puede trasladar su hipnótica e inquietante presencia a un entorno mucho menos sombrío que el de la serie antes mencionada. Es una pena que a Braddock se le haya dado una resolución tan fría y apresurada. El estilo de Ruben Fleischer sólo se hace presente a ratos. Se nota que el realizador no pudo decidir mucho en lo que se refiere a la historia, aunque resulta obvio que trabajó muy de cerca con el elenco. La habilidad para la comedia de la cual ya había presumido funciona de manera muy conveniente para lo que se cuenta aquí. Además, el cineasta vuelve a dirigir secuencias de acción muy bien coreografiadas de exploradores enfrentándose con piratas a bordo de antiguos barcos suspendidos en el aire con la ayuda de helicópteros, y también una alocada apertura que involucra un avión y una caída libre. Tales escenas llegan a nuestros ojos con tanto brío que, por un instante, es posible olvidar que en el fondo no hay un buen trabajo de escritura. Conforme pasan los años, el cine de aventuras ha entrado a un declive de originalidad. La fórmula es siempre la misma: un explorador o exploradora que une fuerzas con uno o varios personajes secundarios para encontrar un tesoro o resolver un misterio. Entregas como La leyenda del tesoro perdido (2004), Tomb Raider (2001, 2018) o incluso Jumanji (1995, 2017) han echado mano de los avances tecnológicos de sus respectivas épocas para tratar de capturar a nuevas audiencias. En todos los casos, los productos resultantes entretienen mientras se están viendo, pero cuando termina la función queda un vacío. La película Uncharted: Fuera del mapa se une a esta tendencia. Se deja ver, pero no se hablará mucho de ella en el futuro. Es inevitable reconocer que le debe mucho a otros clásicos del género, particularmente a Cazadores del arca perdida (1981). Y es que cuando, en algún punto del filme, se cuela una mención a Indy, nos llega, como cubetazo de agua helada, el pensamiento de que a éste universo cinematográfico en construcción todavía le falta mucho para estar en el podio de los grandes. Pese a esto, sería osado no reconocer que tiene potencial. Habrá que ver si se hace la secuela que se promete al final.

"May 13, 2022"," November 2007 saw the release of game developer Naughty Dog’s action/adventure third-person perspective game Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. Since then, the series has developed six more titles that function as either sequels or spin-offs, tracking the adventures of Nathan Drake, Vincent “Sully” Sullivan, Chloe Frazer, and Elena Fisher as they seek out fame and fortune amid various dangers natural and manmade. It makes sense that Sony Pictures would want to develop a live-action version of this very profitable and popular PlayStation exclusive game, yet it sat in development for some time as various principle members dropped in and out of it due to one issue or another. It took so long, in fact, that interested actor Mark Wahlberg (Four Brothers) went from playing adult Drake to Drake’s surly companion Sully, while Sony Pictures star Tom Holland (Spider-Man: Homecoming trilogy) slid into the lead role in a newly fashioned prequel film. Having seen a theatrical release in February 2022, the Holland-Wahlberg-led video game adaptation Uncharted, directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) from a script from writers Rafe Judkins (Chuck), Art Marcum (Iron Man), and Matt Holloway (Iron Man), now hits shelves on home video, requiring no clues, no puzzles, and no global trips to track down. It’s been 15 years since brother Sam Drake left to pursue the mystery of the Magellan-Elcano expedition which was rumored to have possessed an enormous golden treasure, and Nathan Drake (Holland) finds himself a bartender with a wealth of knowledge that comes in handy when trying to engage with a little pickpocketing from his wealthy clientele. This changes when Victor Sullivan (Wahlberg) arrives at his bar offering Nathan an opportunity to find the answers he and his brother sought to find long ago. Doing so, however, puts the naïve treasure hunter on the radar of Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a member of the family who originally bankrolled Magellan’s expedition who’s willing to do whatever it takes to get their investment back. Caught in a situation where the allure of the truth (both of his brother’s fate and of the gold itself) and the life-or-death danger he finds himself in as Moncada’s hired assassin Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and her goons close in, Nathan is going to have to step up if he’s going to survive.

The following home release review will not engage in any kind of comparison between Fleischer’s film and the game series as I’ve never played any of the games, not out of lack of interest, but ours is an Xbox/NES home. So if you’re looking for some sense of how truthful Uncharted is to the games, you’ll need to look elsewhere. Additionally, this home release review will discuss some specific details of the film, so if you’re looking for a spoiler-free read, here’s your second heads-up that you might want to bail now. That said, it is clear that Fleischer and the creative team did try to incorporate some elements of the gaming experience by throwing in the occasional first-person sequence to make it feel like a cut-scene, and Holland himself mentions his attempts to make certain movements, like jumping from one object to another or climbing, as close to actual gameplay as possible. In the opening sequence, Nathan awakens to find himself floating in the air, his foot tangled in the netting of a supply drop box that’s one of a series of boxes tethered to the plane they are all hanging out of. Just before it cuts to flashback, the camera shifts from us observing Holland as Nathan tries to avoid bad guys and get back inside the plane to his perspective as he flies through the air, having been knocked off his feet. It’s a bit of free fall which anyone having played either first-person or third-person games will recognize as a method that the developers use to help the player get within the headspace or experience of the character. Thankfully, the film doesn’t rely on this particular gimmick very much, allowing it to appear as a nice stylistic flourish amid a more traditional action/adventure swashbuckling ride. Because of this, folks who are familiar with the games are more likely to recognize the reference, while non-gamers and/or non-Uncharted players can still enjoy the film as a more general adventure story. For example, toward the end of the film, Nathan climbs aboard a ship by jumping up and grabbing an exposed cannon, using that to lift himself up onto the ship. If not for Holland mentioning that this was a specific choice to emulate how Drake moves as a character when engaging with his surroundings, I’d have just presumed this was a more adventurous way to climb up, not a reference for Uncharted fans. It’s this wider accessibility which helps Uncharted (the film) be a good time. Which Uncharted absolutely is, though it mostly achieves this on the back on the all-too-game cast. It’s a globetrotting adventure, to be sure, yet there’s something missing in the execution to make it feel as mythical as the Ark of the Covenant, a national treasure hidden by the Founders, or even One-Eyed Willie’s gold. Rather than using the allure and intrigue shared by the audience and characters to encourage the audience to lean in, Uncharted makes it worth the visit (and possible re-visit) with its cast. For the first time in a long time, Holland’s vocal inflection doesn’t sound like Peter Parker, a trouble I’ve had distinguishing one performance (live-action or animated) from another. Between this, Holland’s physicality (he does as many stunts as the film would allow), and his chemistry with Wahlberg, Uncharted feels like we’re seeing Holland truly step into a leading role that feels more mature, even if the character is still more fresh than several of his other on-screen personas. Wahlberg, too, seems to be naturally settling into a more mature, less physical role with his performances of late. He can still do action (Infinite) and remains adept at it, but his fast tongue helps him shine as Sully, the grey mentor to Nathan’s very white treasure hunter. From the bonus features, specifically “The Buddy System,” we learn that Holland and Wahlberg would often improvise their dialogue to each other, using the script as a jumping off point to help them find their versions of the character. If you pay attention in the key sequence, you can catch Sophia Ali in what appears to be a break in character as Chloe Frazer’s face starts to laugh at one of the pair’s exchanges. Entertaining as the stunts are, Uncharted wouldn’t be as watchable with two leads who’re clearly having a ball together. Add in Ali and Gabrielle as foils for the two and you’ve got yourself a tennis match, the quips and punches flowing in equal measure as the actors embody what happens when you get in the treasure hunter life. L-R: Sophia Taylor Ali as as Chloe Frazer, Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, and Mark Wahlberg as Victor Sullivan in Columbia Pictures’ UNCHARTED. Photo by: Clay Enos. ©2021 CTMG, Inc. All rights reserved. Where the film falters is two-fold: the wavering cleverness of its lead character and the reliance on CG for some of the stunts. Straight-up, I buy a young Nathan being able to problem-solve this centuries-old mystery over the course of the film. This is something he and his brother have been working on for ages and Nathan gets a quick leg up thanks to the work Sully’s done prior to their meeting. All Nathan has to do is make his knowledge practical. No issue here. What I do take issue with is the flashback shows us Nathan using his brother’s lighter as a means of seeing a hidden message, after which the film then breadcrumbs that Sam has been leaving Nathan messages in the postcards he’s sent to Nathan over the years. Nathan even comments that Sam and he used to use coded messages, so why did it *never* occur to Nathan to check the postcards as they came in? As a character, the motivation to go on this journey with Sully is as much about finding the gold as it is learning about his brother and possibly finding him. The script makes it very clear in the brief workout montage that Nathan’s been keeping himself in shape so as to be limber for whatever shenanigans Sam might get him into. So why does it take so long into the film for Nathan to make the connection? Additionally, for a film which has a number of great on-location set pieces, the ones which ruin the illusion are the ones which don’t blend the physical sets or pieces attached to a gimbal with the final composite image we see that’s had VFX work done on it. I can buy Nathan jumping from supply box to supply box — the camera’s in tight, Holland is in focus, his movements are clear and easy to follow — but it’s harder to believe when he and Chloe are trying to get their balance on a supply box as it flies through the air as the camera swirls around them and their bodies start to take on a plastic, computer-generated look. It also doesn’t help that the difference in quality is far more noticeable depending on the action on-screen. The museum heist sequence is very clearly a practical sequence, movements easier to track with longer shots and less cutting, whereas the big action sequence at the end involves the amount of cuts which can make someone dizzy. Even worse, it’s the amount of cuts that make one wonder if the cast was able to complete the stunt as intended or if something’s being hidden. If there’s one nit-pick that’s clearly just fan-service, it’s the brief-yet-extended exchange between Nathan, Chloe, and the hotel guest they speak with on the beach after surviving their in-air fall. For fans of the Uncharted series, it’s an opportunity to celebrate Nathan North, the video game voice-actor for Nathan Drake who also served as the physical representation of the character. For folks like me, it’s a strange interruption to the flow of the film that they have this exchange with a stranger. If I weren’t familiar with North from his work in other properties, gaming, animated film, and live-action programming, I would’ve been really curious why we had to stop the film to find out that this rando could relate to the pair having fallen out of the sky. It may have been stronger to utilize a small, subtle honorific as they walked by — like Brie Larson as Captain Marvel walking past Captain Marvel comic writer Kelly Sue DeConnick or even the way that Arnold Schwarzenegger hands the metaphorical action hero torch to Dwayne Johnson as a bar patron who simply remarks “Have fun” as they pass each other – because the scene as constructed is extended enough to draw curiosity, which can be confusing to those less familiar with the reference, disrupting the momentum of the scene. Whether you loved Uncharted or not, the bonus features, brief though they may be, do highlight just how much care went into making the film. In addition to a feature-length audio commentary featuring Fleischer, there’s a menagerie of materials: one music video, four theatrical release marketing videos, six featurettes, and eight deleted/extended scenes. Excluding the commentary, you’re looking at roughly 45 minutes of materials to help deepen your knowledge and fun of the film. As someone with zero knowledge of the games, it was particularly fascinating to learn how Uncharted incorporated referential material (movement, sequences, frequent & specific curses Drake uses) into a wholly original story. This may upset purists who find the storylines of the game series perfect as is (and I get it, I lived through the mess that is 2008’s Max Payne), but I can also see the opportunity, as expressed in the featurettes, that doing a prequel offers: you can see Nathan at the start of his journey and then borrow as needed to craft new stories that may have the potential to delight both gaming and general audiences alike. It certainly doesn’t hurt that you can feel the excitement in making this and the possibility of more films come through whenever Holland and Wahlberg (though mostly Holland) interject their perspectives on the process of making the film.

Uncharted is an opportunity to have a ball at the movies, something which often gets lost between the art house films and major blockbusters. It’s the kind of film which relies as much on fun characters being clever as it does the action, harkening back to the adventure stories of our, or at least this reviewer’s, youth. If they can retain as much of the central cast as they can and maybe tighten up the editing, everything needed for a solid action/adventure crowd-pleasing series may be right here.",POSITIVE
"May 9, 2022"," Tom Holland delivers an athletic action man performance,  yet a lack of chemistry with his co-stars, along with Ruben Fleischerâs pedestrian  filmmaking, makes Uncharted an underwhelming action adventure of little  thrill or stakes. Here is another example on how difficult it is to adapt a  video game to the big screen. For years game lovers have been vying for a movie  adaptation of popular video game Uncharted, but surely this Ruben  Fletcher (Zombieland) directed bore of a film isnât what they  were hoping for? Those of us who donât know the different between Nathan  Drake and Drake the rapper will find this attempted cross between The Da  Vinci Code and Fast and the Furious to be banal at best. Uncharted has the elements for a solid adventure movie â action, romance, mystery â yet the  execution is lazy. Uncharted begins with young adventurer Nathan  Drake (Tom Holland) literally hanging on to dear life from a cargo plane in mid-flight.  What should have been a thrilling moment is ho-hum with its lack of stakes and  unoriginality. Flashback sometime and we see Drake recruited by Victor Sullivan  (Mark Wahlberg), a seasoned and shifty fortune hunter who is after the fabled treasure  of the 16th century Magellan expedition. Drake and Sullivan follow the clues to several different  exotic locales, finding artifacts and the like that will lead the pair to their  destination. Along the way they cross wealthy bad-guy Santiago Moncada (Antonio  Banderas in perhaps his most boring role yet), and partner with Chloe Frazer  (Sophia Ali), Drakeâs love interesting who is annoying rather than appealing. Worse yet is the chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg.  Whatever old school vs. new school buddy-comedy vibes that the filmmakers of Uncharted were aiming for clearly got lost its mark.  Wahlberg, with permanent scowl and monotone delivery,  phones it in with spiritless ease. Holland fairs better with an athletic action  man performance, yet his on screen personality is as flavourless as they come.  While the British actor can get away with such a thing in Spider-Man when playing off strong character actors in villainous roles, Uncharted seeâs the young star carrying a franchise on his own and constantly stumbling  while doing so.",NEUTRAL
"May 9, 2022"," Three releases currently in cinema, Michael Bay’s “Ambulance”, Ruben Fleischer’s video-game adaptation “Uncharted”, and Daniel Espinosa’s comic-book adaptation “Morbius” offer divergent (and sometimes convergent) approaches to what blockbuster filmmaking looks like in 2022. Even as neither of the three reaches Matt Reeves’ “The Batman” as far as blockbuster filmmaking goes this year, I know I’ll be thinking about “Ambulance” – its stylistic approach to staging a crime thriller, its complex performances working in tandem (and sometimes at intriguing cross-purposes) and the intriguing ambivalence of its approach to morality and ethics in contemporary America – for a while. One inarguable fact about “Ambulance” is that there are depths to its filmmaking and even its themes that demand consideration as each frame teams with energy that feels shockingly (and also worryingly) distinct from the genericity of too much that’s playing in the larger wide-release cinematic complex. In typical Michael Bay fashion, “Ambulance” begins in high gear and stays there for most of its runtime. As far as set-ups go, the story is typically bare, waiting for the dazzling escapades that come before the end of the first act, and don’t let up until the very end. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II plays Will, a war veteran who has been tossed aside after being discharged, with a sick wife and a young child. He’s looking for work to assist. His brother (Jake Gyllenhaal as Danny, in the walking form of someone who seems continuously high on amphetamines) is a lifelong criminal who helps Will out by including him a team that’s set to pull off a major bank heist. This goes wrong, and badly. The two brothers are separated from their team, in an ambulance with a shot police, and a traumatised paramedic on a highspeed chase throughout LA. Of the 136 minutes running time, roughly ¾ is spent on board that very ambulance. And each of those minutes, including a last ten minutes that I am somewhat uncertain on, are filled with kinetic, stylistic flourishes and a wholly committed approach to crime on screen that feels incredibly thought out and effective. In short, “Ambulance” is a great time at the cinema. Every other scene features a new character, introduced with some flourish that feels – at first – extraneous. But with each new addition the script (from Chris Fedak) is putting together a very focused labyrinth of personalities and peoples to reach a climactic confluence of events that feels particularly impressive for the kind of films playing alongside it in cinemas. A lot of this comes from the film’s drone technology. Bay along with cinematographer Roberto De Angelis and editor Pietro Scalia have such a distinct vision of what this version of LA looks like that it gives everything on screen a sharp visual identity that feels exciting to watch. Scalia’s work in particular harkens back to his really aggressive approach to violence, bodies and machinery from “Black Hawk Down”. “Ambulance” isn’t working at that war-epic scale, but it’s really thrilling as a genuine piece of filmmaking that has such clear ideas about giving audiences a constant burst of intensity that never lets up. The visual commitment to stylistic flourishes that border on insanity, with an ability to gracefully draw back when needed feels necessary amidst stranger approaches to blockbuster filmmaking. I say this, even as I’ve been trying to wrestle my own ambivalence about the moral stance of “Ambulance” with my excitement about its filmmaking, though. This ambivalence has as  much to do with the murky dichotomy of the stakes the film sets up as well as with the (perhaps intentional) ways that the film itself unfolds as an intense adrenaline-soaked experience that then leaves you with a sense of unease when the intensity falls and you’re left to grapple with that resolution. Beyond the question of thinking too hard about a fun blockbuster, I do wonder on the film’s own murkiness in seeming generally less energetic and interested in its law-enforcement characters but also feeling tethered to an ultimate sense of law and order at its core that feels hollow as opposed to illuminating or even challenging. A final decision of a major character in the climax feels so odd that I find myself thinking of its implications for a long time after. And yet, that kind of ethical – and even thematic – messiness isn’t really a mark against a film that has an interest in using the possibilities of what a film can DO in a way that feels so genuinely exciting. Moreover, its handle on contemporary America as a place of capitalistic rot feels apt with a late-film moment of dejected bodies surrounded by flying dollar bills feels fittingly dismal. After a brief time away from the movies in the cinema, the heights of “Ambulance” felt seductive in ways that almost made me overwhelmed. It’s the kind of ecstatic response to actual filmmaking that feels genuinely propulsive and invigorating. A film like “Ambulance”, which emphasises its kinetic silliness and ribald sensibilities, feels so valuable and genuine and energetic right now. It’s a sensibility and purposiveness that’s all but absent in “Uncharted” – a limp and crude film about a search for lost-treasure that felt tiresome by the minute, so much so that it made me momentarily worried about the future of Tom Holland as an actor. Holland, a celebrity I genuinely enjoy in interviews, feels lifetimes away from his virtuosic work as a child in “The Impossible”. In the banalities of “Uncharted” he feels neutered and colourless in ways that feel enervating. Despite better reviews, I found it way less engaging that the schematic “Morbius,” which I must admit to being vaguely intrigued by. Even as Jared Leto’s personal celebrity feels tiresome, he at least has a sense of character more than any figure in “Uncharted”. In fact, “Morbius”, despite its odd structure, feels interesting for me for its odd – but still intentional – approaches to its world and visuals. “Uncharted” on the other hand feels genuinely pallid, insensible and un-invigorating. Perhaps I am too susceptible to things that are specific rather than generic, but I can think of very few films specifically like “Morbius.” “Uncharted” contains nothing that has not been done better on every level elsewhere in better films. “Ambulance,” meanwhile, is invigorating even as its working within a very familiar framework of brothers on different sides of the law, the criminal as protagonist and the highspeed chase as a film plot. Despite its familiarity, it’s exciting and indelible stuff. More of this in blockbuster cinema, please.",NEGATIVE
"May 4, 2022"," Based on the popular game franchise, Uncharted brings intrepid fortune hunter Nathan “Nate” Drake (Tom Holland) to the big screen. Given that the Uncharted series itself was a mish-mash of influences, with echoes of Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider in particular, it’s unsurprising that the cinematic version displays a similar air of the derivative. Nathan Drake might not sport a bullwhip or fedora, and he might avoid raiding tombs, but the beats of his adventures are as old as some of the treasures he seeks. After being raised in an orphanage, and dealing with his brother Sam running away, Nate spends his time working as bartender and indulging in the occasional grift to keep himself afloat. One day Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) wanders into his life, and reveals that he previously worked with Nate’s brother on uncovering the mysteries of the whereabouts of a large cache of gold left behind by the crew of the infamous Magellan expedition (the first time the globe was circumnavigated). Eager to find his brother, Nate joins Victor – and fellow treasure hunter Chloe (Sophia Ali) – to solve the clues, travel the world and find all the pieces of the puzzle. But Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a rich member of the family who funded Magellan’s expedition, and his hired mercenary Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) are hot on their tails, determined to take the gold for themselves. There’s very little ambition within Uncharted aside from attempting to make a solid action movie. While there’s nothing wrong with that per se, it does make for an experience that settles for an almost dull predictability. “Oh look , it’s some ancient treasures that turn out to be a key.” “Quick, let’s all watch the chase through some dusty catacombs.” “Here we go, it’s a rickety old pirate ship hidden in a cave.” Anyone with a passing knowledge of the likes of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, The Da Vinci Code or even The Goonies will have seen it all before. There are moments when the film tries to lampshade its derivativeness – a line about “playing Indiana Jones” is invoked while Nate gets to utter “Nuns. Why’d it have to nuns?” – but it all feels a bit forced. Uncharted does try to add a little intrigue to the mix with one of the film’s central themes being about how people can trust one another, but even the likes of recent Netflix actioner Red Notice have made the whole double cross/intrigue narrative somewhat old hat. Most of the time Fleischer provides solid action, with set pieces on a plane and in an auction house, plus Nate busting out the now de rigeur parkour skills alongside the usual balletic fight sequences. Bonus points are given, though, for the sheer audacity of the final sequence, which involves helicopters and pirate ships. It’s gloriously silly and one of the highlights of the film, for its sheer bombast if nothing else. The cast are equally as solid. Holland’s slightly bumbling persona is on show, although his action lead status is sometimes at odds with his air of naivety and youthful looks. It works for the Spider-Man character but he needs a little bit more fire to truly command the screen in the way films like this demand. Wahlberg slinks his way through with plenty of charm, while Gabrielle clearly enjoys fulfilling the bad guy role. Unless you’ve been buried in a tomb, then there isn’t anything here that hasn’t been done or seen before. But fans of the original games will find a few Easter eggs rolled their way. This is a diverting action film that will fill the time, at least until the next Indiana Jones sequel. Images on VODzilla.co are authorised and subject to restrictions.

"Apr 29, 2022"," The Gist: Nathan Drake (Holland) awakens in freefall, god knows how many thousand feet above the Earth’s surface. His foot is caught in the strap of a string of cargo dangling from an airplane, and to make matters inconvenient, some bad guys are also shooting at him. This is not exactly an ideal way to emerge from naptime, but maybe that goes without saying. How did he get in this predicament? Well, this being one of those movies that starts with something exciting under the assumption that it’s one twitch of a mosquito’s proboscis away from audience boredom, we have to flash back to find out, then work our way back to this harrowing scene. How far do we have to flash back? To Nathan’s childhood, of course, duh, when he and his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) lived in an orphanage and were such history nerds, they broke into a museum to steal the first map of the whole world ever drawn. This got them in trouble, prompting Sam to run away and never be seen again. Subtitle: NEW YORK, PRESENT DAY, which is a lie, because we know the actual present day is the day in which Nathan is falling out of an airplane, so this particular moment actually occurs at least a few days before the present day. (Sloppy-ass movies are slowly killing me, I tell you.) Nathan bartends at a fancy spot called Kitty Got Wet (yeesh), where he flips and tosses bottles like Cruise in Cocktail and pickpockets valuables from well-moneyed marks like Oliver Twist. Then he goes home to a teensy, crummy apartment where he works out without wearing a shirt. One day, Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Wahlberg) parks himself at Kitty Got Wet (yeesh) and reveals that he knows all about Nathan – his sheisty maneuvers, and his interest in the fabled lost gold of famed Spanish explorer Magellan. Sully knew Sam, working together to find the treasure. But Sam’s now lost or dead maybe; Nathan agrees to help Sully, hoping to find his beloved brother, and end up with a chunk of the legendary multi-billion-dollar booty, which may not exist because no one over the centuries has ever located it. But I’ve got a good feeling about this, because if Nathan and Sully weren’t smarter than everyone else who ever lived since the 1520s, there wouldn’t be a ridiculous movie about them – and this certainly doesn’t seem to be the type of story that ponders upon failure as a key contributor to personal psychological growth. So off they go, Indiana Da Vinci Code Jonesing around Barcelona and the Philippines, following clues and finding artifacts, and picking up a third partner, Chloe Frazer (Ali), to help out with the wheres and whatfors. They’re not the only ones on the gold trail – nasty-nasty, old-old-money billionaire Santiago Moncada (Banderas), whose family privately bankrolled Magellan himself (I told you it was old money), wants the living shit out of it, and employs a cold-blooded, mean-as-hell damn killer, Braddock (Gabrielle), to do his dirty, dirty work. The “funny” thing here is, Sully and Chloe are such slippery backstabbing eels, each keeps telling Nathan not to trust the other, so he’s the earnest kid caught between two seasoned swindlers, relatively speaking anyway. Fists, bullets and banter fly, but ARE WE NOT ENTERTAINED? What Movies Will It Remind You Of?: National Treasure meets Cocktail meets Raiders of the Lost Ark meets The Da Vinci Code meets Mission: Impossible meets The Goonies meets Cutthroat Island. Performance Worth Watching: Holland shows more go-get-’em gusto here than in any of his non-Spider-Man outings. He has oodles of charisma and an eager capability to carry glossy, action-driven entertainment with flimsy characters and barely a sneeze in the direction of subtext. Is that a backhanded compliment? Yes – and no! It’s a long way of saying I’d love to see him take a creative step forward and continue the Mission: Impossible franchise after Tom Cruise retires. Sex and Skin: None. A hotel-room scene in which Holland is shirtless and Ali’s terrycloth robe hangs off her shoulder is frustratingly fruitless. So, TBFOOBMALADWTOTOTF: Too Busy Fussing Over Old Maps And Legends And Devising Ways To Outsmart The Others To F—. Our Take: Uncharted is the type of movie that makes you want to keep pointing out that it’s the type of movie that does this cliched thing and that other cliched thing. Therefore, it’s the type of movie in which our protagonists can just rampage through an ancient historic church with a pair of bolt cutters and not only never see a single security guard, but barely get a scrunched-brow glance from an old nun. The type of movie in which booby traps were OBVIOUSLY designed to murder sluggish, untoned 16th-century softbodies, not ultra-quick keto-parkour-pilates-HIIT-whatever 21st-century hardbodies like Holland and Ali’s. The type of movie that will set a key sequence inside a popular ketchup-on-cardboard pizza chain (which one? By far the worst one!) and be utterly shameless about it. The type of movie that believes “Some kind of Roman antechamber” is not only a complete sentence, but a good, solid piece of dialogue. The type of movie with several is-she-outta-bullets/she’s-never-outta-bullets action sequences. The type of movie with great scads and wads of cheap crummy CGI visual effects, because they’re surely expensive even if they’re not particularly convincing. The type of movie that takes stuff from 20 other movies and makes bland porridge out of it. It’s also the type of movie that isn’t half-bad as far as unapologetic timewasters go, a plausibility-be-damned, every-detail-is-a-plot-device story about an elite cadre of morally compromised, but ultimately likable big-dreamer action figures following twisty-turny dotted lines on old-timey maps to big piles of gold, spitting one-liners at each other and engaging in bloodless violence along the way. (How bloodless? So bloodless, when a character gets their throat cut, there’s, like two drips. Gotta keep that PG-13!) For sure, Fleischer knows his way around a snappy action sequence, but this is all pretty generic, high-flying/low-stakes middle-of-the-road stuff, slickly made and perfectly watchable and all the more boring for it. Our Call: SKIP IT. Uncharted is kind of a parkour Pirates of the Caribbean, and if that sounds like it kind of sucks, you’d be right. Call me when there’s a capoeira Mission: Impossible.",NEGATIVE
"Apr 22, 2022"," Roland Emmerich is back with a big disaster flick! Excited yet? Moonfall is the latest in the Emmerich pantheon that has given us films such as Independence Day, Godzilla, and The Day After Tomorrow, and, here, well, the moon has fallen out of orbit and this event leads to a huge conspiracy theory being uncovered. On a story level, what can you say about such an absurd idea? In true Emmerich fashion, Moonfall isn’t trying to be anything other than a big disaster film, it knows exactly what it is and delivers on its promise - it’s a big film with a lot to take in visually alongside even bigger stretches of logic. Everyone is game for the job and Jon Bradley is surprisingly good in his role, though Patrick Wilson felt like he was going through the motions at times in a role that called for greater emotion the deeper the movie went. There are some impressive set pieces, which almost should be expected, as the Earth is thrown out of balance and a conspiracy theory angle that was decent, but aside from that, Moonfall doesn’t really offer much else. The script is muddy, maybe there was an attempt to justify the reasons for the disaster scientifically but it comes across as jargon at times. Half of the movie delivers on the popcorn fun aspect, however, the remaining half is, at times, dreadful - be it the story, the subplots, the side characters, the deviations, there’s quite a lot that drags Moonfall down further than a…moon dragged out of orbit. Whilst I hadn’t expected greatness but maybe expected worse, Moonfall is an awful film that has some awfully fun moments. The juggernaut franchise that is Uncharted has finally received a big screen adaptation after what seems like many years and it can boast the hottest star in the world, Tom Holland, as its front man. As a disclaimer, I have not played these games so I was able to watch this through the eyes of someone wanting an action-adventure romp. There certainly was action AND adventure, it’s just neither element was particularly exciting. The movie kept my attention throughout without ever really ensuring that I was entirely invested, this film is fine - it just felt a bit empty, a bit soulless. The attempts at fun and comedy didn’t always pay off and the sense of adventure felt a bit off-key - Fleischer seemingly aimed for Uncharted to be grounded and fun…until it became a video game in the third act - not a video game film. The major third act sequence is adapted and pulled off extremely well and initially provides some thrills and spectacle but it falls foul of genuine leaps of logic (including a lost ship being pretty visible in its cave). Whilst being fairly pacey, the movie also suffers from feeling choppy, there was no real sense of where we are in the world given the globe-travelling nature of the narrative - this felt like a missed opportunity to create a grander scale and scope. Tom Holland is hampered by the lackluster script, and I couldn’t quite buy him in the role - he’s a likable lead, absolutely, but I didn’t feel as if he imbued the role fully. Similarly (and maybe less surprisingly), Mark Wahlberg felt like he was doing a Mark Wahlberg impression, though Banderas was decent in his small, villainous role. Uncharted doesn’t quite end up as Indiana Jones-lite, and it’s not really any worse than 2018’s Tomb Raider, but it just felt flat and generic. Maybe the clearly-hinted at sequel will deliver more so than this. Kenneth Branagh’s Agathaverse is back with his adaptation of the author’s classic Death on the Nile. Serving as a follow up to 2017’s Murder on the Orient Express, Hercule Poirot (Branagh) returns to solve another impossible murder mystery, this time set against the backdrop of the Nile. Here, Branagh goes bigger and more cinematic than he did for Murder, but Death on the Nile just isn’t as good - taking into account Murder was simply ‘OK’ as well. I never found myself  gripped by the story which is sadly a hammer blow for a murder-mystery, there was too much setup before the actual murder began to be investigated. Setup is good, rounding out characters is good, but it just takes far too long to get to the crux of the story here and everything beforehand isn’t exciting (or really interesting) enough to be engaging. Every performance is just fine, Annette Bening is reliably good and Sophie Okonedo was a highlight of the movie (Russell Brand seemed unrecognisable in his role as a doctor). Sadly, it seems Branagh is the problem, the films are less about the pivotal mystery and murder than they are about Poirot himself -  whilst Poirot is our lead man, the murder mystery will always be far more interesting and should be taking centre stage rather than providing a spotlight for Branagh’s dodgy accent and on origin story for the moustache (that genuinely happens and I hated every second). Something was needed to distract from the jarringly bad visuals and mundane score, but a saviour never really appeared. The classic tropes of the genre worked - the ubiquitous sequence outlining the characters potential motives are revealed and deduction scenes are well executed - however, it’s hard to find much that’s successful here - it’s all rather forgettable. Unremarkable is the best thing I can say about Death on the Nile.",NEUTRAL

"Mar 30, 2022"," A film like Uncharted is not really designed to spark broader conversations about the nature of entertainment. Based on the long-running adventure video game franchise of the same name, it is certainly fair to label the whole affair as a cash grab designed to appeal to fans of both the series and of superstar lead actor Tom Holland. There’s something more at stake for the action genre as a whole in this era defined by massive budges and connected universes. The film is largely a paint-by-number swashbuckler that borrows heavily from 90s genre tropes. Nathan Drake (Holland) is a skilled pickpocket desperate for news of his long-lost brother Sam (Rudy Pankow), the two separated at an orphanage at an early age. Savvy fortune hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Walhberg) quickly enlists Nathan’s help in locating the lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan, both displaying a knowledge of history that highlights their proficiency at reading half a Wikipedia page. Nathan and Sully are joined in their quest by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a fellow thief with an arsenal of one-liners and a weird backstory with Sully. Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a spoiled heir desperate for treasure, and his chief enforcer Jo (Tati Gabreille) supply the necessary cartoon villainy that every globe-trotting treasure hunt needs. There are plenty of predictable character twists that anyone can see coming from a mile away, but the actors all showed up to engage in earnest to bring a semblance of seriousness to their one-dimensional roles. The laughably atrocious screenplay is perpetually buoyed by the film’s tight pacing and strong cast chemistry. Though it often seems to have happened completely by accident, Uncharted manages to be a pretty entertaining summer action flick. It’s not good, but it’s too fun to be bad. Other actors might try and phone in their performance when faced with a script as clunky as this mess. Holland is his earnest self, doing his best to give the audience a fun time, playful banter with Wahlberg and Ali that does grow on you after a while. Drake does not seem terribly likely to be Holland’s next blockbuster vessel, but the role does showcase his A-list credentials. Uncharted is a good testament to the power of a strong leading man in today’s franchise-heavy age. Director Ruben Fleischer deserves a lot of credit for his technical skills. The special effects won’t necessarily blow anyone away, but Fleischer’s camera work does elevate the material above plenty of other video game adaptations. The narrative could do without about ten minutes off of its 116-minute runtime, but the pacing does have a way of keeping things fresh in a way that the script never seems to understand. Uncharted is overly content in its commanding mediocrity, but there’s a certain joy in watching the film that’s hard to ignore. Some lines and plotholes are so terrible that they make you laugh out loud. The action sequences are completely over the top in their resounding absurdity. Fleischer’s work begs to be watched on the biggest screen possible, a throwback to the days when visiting the cinema felt like something you did just to sit in those comfortable seats and turn your brain off. Uncharted should have been a better film, but it’s too enjoyable not to recommend. Five year Estradiol Illusions anniversary! Ian talks about what she’s been up to this year, mostly writing and trying to get over yet another breakup. Life is a tricky game. Best to keep a stiff upper lip and get on with things.

"Mar 28, 2022"," In the interest of fairness, this review should be prefaced by noting that this writer has never even owned a PlayStation, never mind played an Uncharted game. However, that’s not really the point when we’re talking about a $120 million blockbuster starring one of the world’s most popular stars, one that Sony really hope launches a franchise. Bringing a beloved console favorite to the big screen requires a delicate balancing act, one that an alarmingly low number of adaptations have managed to pull off. Lean too far in the direction of unabashed fan service and you risk alienating casual audiences, but veer off to the opposite side of the equation and you could piss off the diehards. Ruben Fleischer’s Uncharted tries to do both, often at the same time, but the end result is simply the latest in a long line of forgettable actioners that wink and nod to longtime enthusiasts of the source material, while forgetting to craft such trivialities as well-rounded characters, strong plotting, inventive set pieces, or even any sense of fun or urgency. Uncharted was never going to escape the shadow of Indiana Jones, which is the template by which all globetrotting treasure-hunting adventures will always be measured, so it’s at least smart to name-drop the iconic series and utilize the signature red line on a map to signal far-flung travel, indicating that everybody is fully aware the project will be beaten over the head by contrast and comparison. We’re dropped right into the cargo plane sequence from the very first frame, which then dives swiftly into a prologue building the dynamic between young Nathan Drake and his older brother Sam, before we jump ahead again into the present day to meet the Tom Holland-shaped version of our protagonist. He’s working as a bartender and petty thief, before Mark Wahlberg’s Sully shows up on the scene to immediately offer him a job, arousing a mixture of suspicion and intrigue. Holland is without a doubt one of the most charming and likeable figures in Hollywood, but Nate is neither particularly charming or all that likeable, which has a lot more to do with the script than the Spider-Man star’s performance. The actor admitted he struggled with playing a so-called ‘cool guy’ after spending the majority of his career as an outcast of some description, and it shows. On a physical level, Holland gives everything he has to the performance as he pulls off some nifty fight choreography, but don’t go in expecting a charismatic tour-de-force. His opposite number effectively plays himself, which is unfortunate when the square-jawed Mark Wahlberg: Action Hero persona is by far the least interesting weapon in his onscreen arsenal. Nate and Sully are supposed to gradually warm to each other with the aim of generating a classic buddy movie dynamic, but Holland and Wahlberg have precisely zero chemistry. You can’t buy them as friends, colleagues, or even verbal sparring partners, with the majority of the quips and one-liners falling flat. Along the way, they run afoul of Antonio Banderas’ Santiago Moncada, who seeks the same pirate treasure as our central duo, and you absolutely will not care as to why. One-dimensional villains are par for the course in the studio sandbox, but the only interesting thing in the entirety of Uncharted involving the talented Spaniard turns him into a plot device which furthers the arc of Tati Gabrielle’s Jo Braddock, who at least manages to inject her paper-thin motivations with more personality than the writing deserves. Sophia Ali’s Chloe Frazer is a definite highlight, though, bringing an enthusiasm to her scenes that nobody else among the cast even comes close to replicating, even if the majority of her contributions to the story are signposted from a mile away, robbing any element of surprise from the late-stage revelations we all know are coming. There’s plenty to enjoy for fans of the games, even if watching several memorable moments unfold in live-action isn’t anywhere near as fun when you don’t have a controller in your hands. That being said, Uncharted could have done without making Nolan North’s cameo so blatantly on-the-nose, especially when a lot of casual viewers drawn in by the splashy CGI and Holland’s presence won’t have a clue who the voice acting legend even is. The only time Uncharted really sings is during the climactic third act, which throws everything and the kitchen sink into the equation to deliver a certifiably bonkers finale that involves helicopters, flying pirate ships, cannons, swords, and much more. That probably should have been the tone throughout, because seeing Wahlberg deliver exposition with a blank face every fifteen minutes to spell the next plot machination out to the audience grows tiring pretty quick. Our leads find a clue, talk it out for a little bit, solve the clue to uncover the next one; rinse and repeat for a solid 90 minutes or so. Plenty of video games are open-world these days, so it’s a touch ironic that Uncharted is so doggedly and derivatively linear. Given the inconsistent CGI and relatively small scale of Uncharted up until the aforementioned gung-ho airborne naval warfare, the movie obviously couldn’t push the literal boat out from the first to last minute without breaking the bank, so the stakes are necessitated to remain relatively small before building to a crescendo. On the other side of the coin, it’s hard to invest in something that doesn’t really know what it wants to be, and none of the major players on both sides of the camera seem to have much clue, either. Is it an old fashioned tale of good guys racing to find ancient loot before the bad guys get their hands on it? An origin story to set up multiple sequels? A star vehicle for Holland to prove he can thrive as a blockbuster leading man outside of the Marvel Cinematic Universe? The work of a studio desperate to create a money-spinning property that doesn’t revolve around either Spider-Man or Jumanji? A carefully-curated IP that’s just bland and formulaic enough so as not to offend anyone, without providing a single scrap of originality? The answer is yes to all of the above, and that’s without even mentioning the pair of post-credits scenes, one of which has basically already been revealed in a previous TV spot, so there are clearly plans in mind for further installments, although the real question is whether or not the public will vote with their wallets to make it a reality. Uncharted was clearly aiming for Raiders of the Lost Ark, but it’s ended up much closer to Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.",NEUTRAL
"Mar 25, 2022"," Directed by Ruben Fleischer, Uncharted follows fortune hunters Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) as they set out to locate a fabled treasure before others can get their hands on it. It’s a familiar (yet workable) premise that’s employed to predominantly tedious effect by Fleischer, as the filmmaker, armed with Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway’s screenplay, delivers a slick adventure that’s been suffused with a whole host of unappealing, by-the-numbers elements – including generic wisecracking heroes, a dull, personality-free villain, and an overuse of less-than-convincing computer-generated special effects. The movie’s arms-length feel is perpetuated by a sluggish narrative that doesn’t contain much in the way of forward momentum, to say the least, and it goes without saying that the central quest driving the action forward is hardly as compelling or intriguing as Fleischer has undoubtedly intended – which, in turn, renders the movie’s sparse assortment of exciting set-pieces moot. By the time the eye-rollingly overblown finale rolls around, Uncharted has confirmed its place as just another lackluster contemporary blockbuster that squanders a comfortably familiar setup and the efforts of its charming leads.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 19, 2022"," The Pitch: For non-gamers, Uncharted is a remarkably straightforward project: Hot treasure hunters go on an action-packed adventure to track down a centuries-old treasure? Sure, checks out. Maybe these particular treasure hunters aren’t as nobly intentioned as, say, one Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr., but that doesn’t mean 25-year-old bartender/history buff/aspiring thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) isn’t just as dedicated to tracking down some long lost gold. We first meet Nathan as a 10-year-old living with his older brother Sam in an orphanage, though Sam makes his escape from the place after a run-in with the law, leaving his brother with a family artifact (an engraved ring), followed by, in the ensuing years, a trail of vague postcards from exotic locals. Now (ostensibly) an adult, Nate’s mixing drinks for trust fund girls at fancy bars and swiping their jewelry while they’re not looking — which is where Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) finds him, and offers him a job assisting with a heist/treasure hunt. Having known Sam, Sully feels sure that Nathan’s the right choice to help him track down the gold theoretically recovered by the men sailing with Magellan on his legendary attempt to circumnavigate the globe. And while lacking in experience when it comes to treasure-hunting, Nate does offer a deep knowledge of history and some remarkable upper body strength (the film literally includes a montage of Nate studying building schematics and doing push-ups and pull-ups, lest you question his later feats of climbing and hanging off buildings and whatnot). Of course, Sully and Nate aren’t the only ones after this treasure — not only does Sully enlist the help of another treasure hunter named Chloe (Sophia Ali) in the fight, there’s also the wealthy and evil Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas, hopefully paid very well for his appearance here), who’s hired the ruthless Jo (Tati Gabrielle, wearing a truly breathtaking series of outfits) to track down the treasure as well.",POSITIVE

"Mar 12, 2022"," There’s an inherent challenge to adapting popular video games into films that’s baked into how each medium tells a story. Modern video games are, often by necessity, variable stories dependent on a player to make certain decisions and follow certain leads toward various conclusions, while a film has to steadfastly set a single course and arrive at a single conclusion that may be interpreted in different ways by its viewers. It’s a sometimes subtle distinction, but one that’s created a wide gulf in quality between video games and video game movies. Of course, the most obvious solution to this problem when it comes time to make a video game movie is to set aside all of those gaming variables, pick a story, and stick to your guns once you’ve decided where that story is going. In the case of “Uncharted,” the film based on the popular treasure-hunting game franchise of the same name, the project finally seemed to do exactly that when it cast Spider-Man star Tom Holland in the role of adventurer Nathan Drake. By snagging the twentysomething Holland rather than a slightly older actor, the film earned itself the chance to become a kind of prequel to the games themselves, merging various story elements together to tell the story of how Nathan Drake became the globe-trotting hero gamers have come to know and love. What that should buy “Uncharted,” along with the star power of Holland himself, is a sense of standing alone, an ability to decide exactly what the film version of this story should be without being weighed down too much by the games. It should give us something confident, self-supporting, and most importantly, cohesive. Instead, “Uncharted” emerges as a disjointed mess of a movie that can’t decide if it wants to be full-on video game fun or slick cinematic treasure hunt, leaving Holland swimming upstream against the current of a story that’s as choppy as it is uninteresting. Nathan Drake (Holland) is a pickpocket and bartender who just seems to be biding his time until his long lost brother returns from…wherever he’s gone. As boys, the two became obsessed with a mythic treasure supposedly hidden away by Ferdinand Magellan’s crew centuries ago, but as a man Nathan is more interested in just getting by than he is in any sense of greatness. That changes with the arrival of Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a fast-talking treasure hunter who knew Nathan’s brother and hopes Nathan himself has some of the same spark. It seems Magellan’s treasure was real, Sully has a lead on where it is, and finding the treasure might also lead Nathan to his brother. With the hope of a family reunion guiding him, Nathan sets out in search of his destiny. What follows is meant to establish a bond between Nathan and Sully, one that already exists in the games, for the purposes of an eventual film franchise that will see them team up on multiple adventures. Sadly, despite director Ruben Fleischer’s visual flair and competent pacing, it never really comes together. What’s meant to be a daring, impossible treasure hunt that’s taken other people years to even contemplate feels all too easy in Nathan’s hands, and not in a way that suggests he’s brilliant. On the emotional side of things, though Holland does his level best, his chemistry with Wahlberg never quite emerges from the muck of an underbaked script full of rote dialogue and predictable turns in the action. The whole thing reads like a first draft, like a story that was meant to be polished and deepened later on, only to never reach that point. The treasure hunting feels too simple, the character relationships needlessly complicated, and the setpieces few and far between. By the time the film does reach its third act, and a finale action sequence that’s at least interesting in theory, it feels like too little, too late. This is a shame on many levels, from its waste of Holland’s natural charisma to the potential left behind for sequels that will probably never materialize, or at least take a while to crawl out of the hole this film has dug for them. For all its potential, and all the time spent working on something that could appeal to both longtime fans and newcomers, “Uncharted” can’t ever find the right course to become something that stands on its own. It doesn’t work as a fresh movie or as a familiar adaptation. Instead it falls flat beneath a superficial shimmer, fool’s gold at the end of a treasure map meant as more of a distraction than a meaningful journey.

"Mar 12, 2022"," It’s been 20 years since Drake (Spidey himself, Tom Holland) has seen his older brother Sam, so when Sully (Mark Wahlberg) promises both a huge payday and some hope for the bros to reunite, Drake is all in. Two bejewelled amulets are the keys to a series of adventures, first in the tunnels below San Sebastian, where they are joined by fellow adventurer Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), then to the tropical island resting place of the bounty they seek - all this while, dodging ruthless billionaire Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and the blade-wielding Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Wikipedia describes the gameplay as “jumping, swimming, climbing, swinging from ropes, shooting, combat, puzzle solving, driving, boat riding, and other acrobatic actions.” In that regard, the film has people doing all those things. But there is little connective tissue between the character and their actions; like the game, it feels like Drake and Sully just have to go through this bit to get to that bit. Holland and Wahlberg are repeatedly made to look like not-quite the action film buddies they were paid to be. An obvious template is being employed here to transfer the platform game format into a movie, or at least back into a movie; the game was apparently a riff on globe-hopping adventures like Raiders of the Lost Ark and National Treasure. That partially explains the ‘copy-of-a-copy’ dullness, a film so relentlessly derivative, so cut from the shopworn, tatty cloth of dozens of better films, it never finds its own reason-for-being. Instead, it just creaks and groans towards its CGI-cartoon conclusion.  Ultimately I could care less about this plodding dirge of a film but I do want to point out the most dispiriting thing about this whole mess. Every villain that is trying to derail our white-guy heroes is a) a woman, and/or b) a ‘foreigner’. It is wildly ironic that the only references to the action-adventure films of the past that Uncharted mimics with any skill are the ugliest, most outdated elements.",NEGATIVE
"Mar 11, 2022"," Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg go together like peanut butter and broken glass, like Batman and Ghislaine Maxwell. Pairing an endearing, earnest charmer like Holland with the human embodiment of “What are you looking at?” surprisingly doesn’t work! And that’s the least of “Uncharted’s” problems. It’s not poorly written for a video game-based movie. It’s poorly written for a ransom note. It’s poorly written by the standards of online comment sections. It’s poorly written compared to an Ayn Rand novel. It’s that bad. Holland plays Nathan Drake, who is apparently a beloved character. Having never played the source material, I can only conclusively state this his defining traits are “human male conceived at a “Temple of Doom” drive-in screening.” Marky Mark “plays” Victor “Sully” Sullivan, whose defining traits are identical to 99.99% of other Marky Mark characters. So, yes, he’s basically an unlikeable dingus who would totally be a big Mark Wahlberg fan if he really existed. Sully, who treasure hunts when he isn’t probably spending most of his time telling women they’re “almost hot,” cons Nathan into join him on a quest for Magellan’s gold. This is because Sully can’t figure out clues like “Go to the building that has this picture on it” or “Put a key in a key-shaped hole” without help. Chloe (Sophia Ali) is also in hot pursuit of the money, as are ne’er-do-wells Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). All of these people are dazzled by Nathan’s ability to read instructions that are clearly spelled out and then do them. Like “Raiders of the Lost Ark” if someone wrote it for homework due in 15 minutes, “Uncharted” is almost mesmerizingly boring. The vast majority of it is people talking in depth about things they are going to do before actually doing them and then talking about what an absolute turd bouquet Sully is. Right, so that last part is briefly fun. Holland tries to channel his inner Spidey, but that’s hard with one-line zingers like “Oh, shit!” and “Ah, shit!” and “Shit!” The puzzle-solving adventure elements are at the level of an escape room for drunk people, which is a great idea that nobody should steal from me if it’s not already a thing. Nathan excluded, the characters are literally all wildly unlikeable. Look, if people wanted to hang out with a bunch of jerks, we’d all have no problem going back to the office or family reunions. That “Uncharted” is stupid is neither a shocker nor a deal breaker. That it is this degree of stupid is wholly demoralizing. This is it, huh? This is our collective, mutual IQ threshold now? In the nearly 20 years since “National Treasure,” our historical puzzle-solving abilities have devolved to “There’s an arrow on the wall because the wall shoots arrows.” The post-credit scene is basically the opening sequence to the next film, which is as inevitable as mortality and likely equally pleasant. The sequel will presumably just be “Ow, My Balls” with a decoder ring. If Wahlberg is speaking that phrase, I may be okay with it. Hoai-Tran Bui at Slashfilm says “it’s hard to get a handle on why we should root for Nathan Drake, apart from the fact that he looks like Tom Holland.”",NEUTRAL
"Mar 11, 2022"," I was chatting with an old buddy who doesn’t see many movies but plays a lot of games and mentioned to him how much Uncharted totally sucks. He asked, matter-of-factly, if I was surprised. The answer is no … but also yes? There was no doubt that a movie based on Naughty Dog’s hit series of PlayStation games faced an uphill battle in the quality department just by being based on a video-game. It’s not like the medium has a stellar track record of cinematic adaptations. Heck, we did a whole series of essays about that subject. Walking into this one with the inflated expectations of a 21st-century Indiana Jones would be ludicrous. Expecting something with the corny-but-entertaining energy of the first National Treasure would be optimistic. Still, somehow, Uncharted is a complete mess beyond comprehension, the sort of film where the secrets of the buried treasure are accessible only through the walls of a sterling-clean Papa John’s. Plenty of essays both here and on other film-centric websites have dissected the problems inherent in adapting a video-game into a two-hour narrative blockbuster, so it probably isn’t worth diving deep into them except to say Uncharted exhibits every stereotypical issue faced by this sort of project. There’s a lot of exposition that only really means anything to fans of the games. This particular story is a functional prequel to those, which means a lot of details are setup for plot points resolved by reading the Wikipedia entries for the series. (I don’t have time for games, OK?) As a novice to the franchise, it’s pretty frustrating to watch a movie that spends half its runtime nodding to stories I don’t care about without actually creating one for me to engage with on-screen. Uncharted, as it is, follows Nate Drake (Tom Holland), an orphan thief who is drawn into an adventure by Sully (Mark Wahlberg), a fellow criminal who knew Nate’s missing brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow). Sam disappeared on an adventure with Sully where they were trying to find $5 billion of lost gold left behind by the Magellan expedition. Sully’s not necessarily trustworthy, but Nate ends up helping him anyway to figure out what happened to Sam. Along the way, they meet up with Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), to whom Nate becomes romantically inclined. They’re not the only ones hunting this treasure: Billionaire Santiago Moncada (Antonio Bandaras) and mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) are both hot on its trail, too. Well, kind of. The actual mysteries in the movie are so dumb and unsatisfying that there isn’t any tension to the various twists, turns and intrigues presented. Sully and Nate end up in Barcelona, where the treasure is supposedly buried under a cathedral. They team up with Chloe, and the three of them have to work together, separately, to uncover treasure underneath the aforementioned Papa Johns. Eventually, Nate and Chloe find the catacombs that are accessible through both a nightclub and a sewer grate in busy part of town. These are spoilers, but not really because to say I’m spoiling this would be like accusing me of telling you a Papa John’s pizza is going to taste like cardboard. There isn’t a pleasant surprise to be ruined, here. Even the final battle, which takes place on flying pirate ships suspended by helicopters, is underwhelming despite the fun setup. Really, I wish I enjoyed it more. Holland, for what it’s worth, gives the role of Nate Drake his full commitment and differentiates the character from his iconic Peter Parker enough to think that, with better scripts, he can break free from any typecasting that associates him with acrobatic adventurers (good on him for boosting the box office of this one, though). Wahlberg is a different story. He had signed on to play Drake a few years ago, and maybe in 2020, he’d have carried this type of movie on his shoulders. As a supporting player, though, he’s constantly emanating a douchebag aura that actively harms his scenes with Holland. There’s no reason Drake would grow to love this guy. The audience sure doesn’t. The best I can say about Uncharted is that I was never bored, but of course, that’s because I saw the film with Nick Rogers, and we were able to bullshit about it through most of the runtime. If I had tried to watch this at home, that might be a different story. Who knows? For undiscerning fans of either Holland or the IP, this may satisfy, but as a curious viewer at a Thursday-night showing hoping for a reasonably crafted adventure film … well, there are much better versions of this on every streaming service you have.",NEGATIVE

"Mar 5, 2022"," Tom Holland, the man of endless charm and grit, slips into the role of Nathan Hunt with an admirable ease. But Uncharted relies too much on his camaraderie with Mark Wahlberg when it does not entirely seem to make a case for why it should be the filmâs beating heart. The first thing you should know about Ruben Fleischerâs Uncharted, the big-screen adaptation of the hugely popular action-adventure video game franchise, is the fact that it is not path-breaking. That is not saying much given that the movie adaptation linger in development for 14 years. It is not completely unreasonable then, to expect a movie to have taken the time to arrive at what makes a truly great action thriller. And 14 years later, if the movie adaptation cannot end up being as satisfying as the video series it is based on, how can it really justify its existence? Fleischer, who previously directed Venom, does not seem to have taken these questions into consideration while adapting Uncharted. Instead, he has centered his job around figuring out what it is exactly that people like about the video game series, and then delivering a movie that comes close to replicating all the fuss. Except the strain shows, especially in the moments when Uncharted betrays a disinterest in being anything other than its own thing. The video games revolve around Nathan Hunt, a globe-trotting professional treasure hunter who embarks on dangerous quests around the world in search of priceless treasures and his long-lost brother. The movie deviates from the series, and sticks to the template of an origin story, drawing from several threads from the Uncharted games to envision Nathan as a younger, inexperienced yet playful iteration of the hero. The movie adaptation focuses on Nathanâs loneliness, as a result of his troubled past, and his inherent longing to belong. He is soon shown to be sucked into the jet-setting lifestyle after a meeting with cocky conman and treasure hunter Victor âSullyâ Sullivan [Mark Wahlberg>. On his part, Sully utilises the fact that he shares similarities with Nathanâs long-lost brother to recruit him for the job and earn his trust. Like any director, Fleischer takes it upon himself to design Uncharted as a buddy adventure drama simply because Holland and Wahlberg share the same frame. It is not that the two actors do not have chemistry, just that watching the two inhabit comedic scenes with their banter feels devoid of any fun. There is also another thing: Uncharted relies too much on their camaraderie when it does not entirely seem to make a case for why it should be the filmâs beating heart. In that sense, the crucial letdown of the film is the fact that it has not spent any time on developing its own personality, instead borrowing heavily from the visual language of action franchises like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, and Pirates of the Caribbean. Much of it plays out very mechanically, as if it is a video game and not a movie that involves real people and an opportunity to plumb into the depths of what truly makes them human. The trouble then is that it becomes difficult to realise what exactly Uncharted would be if one were to take out all the adventure from it. You cannot fault Fleischer for not trying and the action set-pieces in the film are proof. Uncharted begins with a wonderful cold-open that ends up being better than anything else the plot attempts over the next two hours. The elaborate set-pieces have a likeable energy to them, which makes up for the fact that they are not particularly inventive. They are still impressive, whether it is a breathless parkour chase set in Barcelona or the absurdly fun final battle that unfolds in the clouds above the Philippines. If the film feels like a wasted opportunity, it is owing to the incoherence of its existence. Fleischerâs direction, for instance, is generic enough to be anonymous. It does not help that Uncharted wears its blandness on its sleeve: the dialogue is not particularly illuminating, and the staging follows convention. Still, the makers display confidence in their material, ending Uncharted with the kind of cliffhanger that promises a sequel. At this point, that might be the only silver lining â maybe it will not be this hard to extract some flavour and fun out of a wild adventure the second time around. Read all theÂ

"Mar 5, 2022"," When a film is based on a video game, there already seems to be a strike against it (think Angelina Jolie's Tomb Raider films, although the 2018 reboot wasn't too bad). But, since I'm a fan of Tom Holland, (even before he was Spider-Man there was his excellent work in The Impossible) and I enjoy Indiana Jones style films, I thought I would give Uncharted a go. The Ruben Fleisher-directed film is actually more like a buddy-film version of National Treasure + Indiana Jones with a bit of Pirates of the Caribbean thrown in for good measure. Holland plays Nate Drake, a New York bartender who enjoys stealing from his workplace's high-end clients. He's recruited by Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to help him find the substantial stash of gold said to be lost by Magellan 500 years ago. Sully's offer doesn't come out of the blue, however. It seems Sully knows Sam (Rudy Pankow), Nate's big brother who was kicked out of the orphanage where they both lived when Nate was 10 years old. Sam's promise that he would return for Nate remains unfulfilled so Nate is eager to discover what Sully knows of his lost sibling. Oh yeah, and finding millions, perhaps billions, worth of gold isn't bad, either. As in any heist/treasure hunt film, there are those who are trying to beat the protagonists to the prize and are willing to do violence to get their hands on the treasure first. Antonio Banderas plays Santiago Moncada, a descendent of the family that originally funded Magellan's exploits, who will spare no expense to beat Sully to the treasure. His hired thug, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), is a stone-cold minion who will stop at nothing to get the loot. Then there is Chloe (Sophia Ali). She has one piece of the puzzle, so Sully and Nate need her, but there is little trust between them. Fleischer's film sports some great action sequences, including the one that opens the film where Nate gets kicked off a plane and must climb a daisy-chain of packing cubes to get back aboard. Seeing huge ships suspended from helicopters chasing each other across the sky brings the big thrills, too, but the film depends on these rather than a well-woven story to anchor it. Pairing big stars Holland and Wahlberg was a huge part of the draw for me but they're not given much interesting dialogue besides the banter they throw back and forth for two hours. I'm always interested when there are nuns in a movie and this one has them! Nuns ran the St. Francis orphanage where Nate and Sam grew up and during the search for clues, Nate and Sully are let into a church by nuns. Nate comments, ""Nuns. Why does it always have to be nuns?"" He's obviously not a big fan but the brief view of nuns we get at least doesn't make them out to be ruler-wielding meanies. There's not much depth to the film as it's meant to be frivolous fun, which it is. There's nothing wrong with that, but while doling out the action adventure, it also makes stealing look like fun, which is quite unfortunate. A treasure hunt is one thing, like in the National Treasure films, but stealing to make a living and enjoying it, not so good. Having said that, what ultimately motivates Nate to follow Sully on this zany adventure is a longing to find someone that was lost to him many years before. He's lived with that pain since he was young and, perhaps, it has contributed to his habit of pilfering. While sins against the eighth commandment can never be condoned, we might be willing to cut Nate a bit of slack since he wants what we all need as human beings: a connection to someone who loves us and gives us a purpose for living, be that someone God or another person who shows us love.

"Mar 1, 2022","  Based on the video game franchise, Uncharted has all the ingredients of a fun and entertaining adaptation, but the recipe doesn’t blend everything together well enough. Movie adaptations of video games don’t have the best history, though there are a few exceptions. Uncharted, however, is unfortunately not one of them. Directed by Ruben Fleischer from a screenplay by Rafe  Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, Uncharted is joyless and has little to no personality.   Nathan “Nate” Drake (Tom Holland) is a bartender in New York who steals small, but expensive things from customers without them noticing. His days serving alcohol end when Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) shows up one night asking Nate to join him in finding the lost treasure of Magellan. Nate only agrees to help because Sully — and, later, fellow treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) — claims to know his older brother Sam, who left their orphanage 15 years prior and only communicates with Nate via postcards. Of course, Nate and Sully are not the only ones after the treasure, with Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), whose family funded Magellan and who believes the treasure is rightfully his, and his associate Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) searching for it as well.   The film opens on an action scene, which includes a second or two where the perspective is distinctly first-person to reflect a video game, but it’s not compelling enough to draw in viewers. One particular action sequence is memorable, but the remaining lack a sense of panache; even the clues throughout are far too quick to solve. What’s perhaps most disheartening is that Uncharted, which is meant to be about Nathan Drake, doesn’t seem very invested in him at all. Everything that happens in the film is more connected to Wahlberg’s Sully than to Nate and even the characters, including Chloe and Braddock, have a direct link to Sully’s past, so much so that Nate is somewhat sidelined in his own story.   Holland is alright in the role, but the issue is the film doesn’t seem to understand who Nate Drake is as a person, even in his early days, and it drags down the story. The film could have been about just anybody with the way Nate is written and that doesn’t make for a well-rounded character whose presence and characterization in the Uncharted games is strong. Wahlberg as Sully has a lot more charisma than Holland as Nate, but they do play off of each other well enough when they do share the screen. To that end, Uncharted works as a buddy adventure rather than as a genuinely good adaptation of the games themselves. Banderas is good as the antagonist Santiago, though he doesn't get enough time to shine, and Gabrielle delivers in her performance. Crucially, it’s her facial expressions that showcase something deeper where the thin script leaves a lot to be desired.   Visually, Uncharted is forgettable. Some of the dialogue — like Chloe and Nate saying “water” as though the audience can’t actually see the water is, in fact, rising — is clunky and unnecessary. Yet another scene sees Sully telling Nate (but really, he’s telling the audience) that he’s catching feelings for Chloe, but their scenes and chemistry don’t at all reflect this statement. In this regard, Uncharted is more concerned with telling instead of showing, which considerably weakens the narrative. The film follows a similar structure as Indiana Jones and even National Treasure; it also draws from Tomb Raider among others, but it’s lacking a distinct spark. It certainly doesn't have the same sense of joy or life that the games have or else the film would have been better.   Nate Drake didn’t need an origin story and when Uncharted leans into the adventure aspects, it’s easy to see what kind of film it might have been if it had just gone all in. There are fun moments and an interesting enough story, sure, but the execution is all rather bland and lacking in energy. When Nate figures out whatever clue is next, the thrill of the journey is subdued. Viewers will find that Uncharted functions a lot like the old lighter Nate carries around — it flickers and burns brightly for a second before going out, the flames too few and far between to be of any significance.

"Feb 28, 2022"," “Sometimes what doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger. Sometimes, it just should have killed you.” Will Ferrell wrote that eleven years ago, and while it was about President George W. Bush at the time, they may as well have been Uncharted, which started its long, tortuous assent to the big screen at the same time.  In theory, a film spends that long in development hell as it gets refined into something good enough to make it to the big screen. Just as often, though, the dying movie turns into a zombie-like Uncharted, limping along until it whatever has been stopping it gives up and it makes its way back to the land of the living when what it really needs is a bullet in the head. Following in the path of the popular PlayStation game, Uncharted introduces us to young Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), theoretically a descendant of the famed explorer Francis Drake who wants to follow in his ancestor’s footsteps for the same reasons… ill-gotten gains.  When a mysterious stranger (Mark Wahlberg) offers him the chance to do just that and, even better, meet back up with his long-lost brother Sam, Nathan can’t say no even though he should. Before long, he is being chased through the sewers of Barcelona by a knife-wielding maniac (Tati Gabrielle) and an obsessed billionaire (Antonio Banderas) trying to figure out both how he got there and the clues that will lead him to the treasure of a lifetime. Uncharted the film, like Uncharted the game, wears its influences on its sleeve without shame… bits of Indiana Jones, bits of National Treasure, and even a little bit of Super Mario Bros.  While Nathan Drake has become an iconic character in the world of video games, that is also a world where, by definition, protagonists are built to encapsulate their players either by being completely anonymous or a cornucopia of popular tropes rather than actual characters. What’s left, once the cameras roll, is the shell of a person animated by the charisma of whoever is inhabiting it and hoping that is enough.  Holland is an excellent Spider-Man but doesn’t fit as easily into a world of ne’er-do-wells, con artists, or cutthroats which, requires more believability as a weathered, experienced man of the world than this version of Nathan Drake (or his actor) can manage. In place of that, director Ruben Fleischer (Venom) and his writers offer up quips, quips, and more quips, trying to manufacture screen chemistry out of thin air between Nathan and his allies Sully and Chloe (Sophia Ali). Everyone works really hard at it, but without much to offer between the surface version of character interaction and various screen puzzles, it tends to fall flat. Rather than lead logically from one set piece to the next, they come across as entirely reverse-engineered, starting with the endpoint and the decision that a clue needs to point to that destination, whether it makes sense or not. As long as it’s there, that’s all that matters. And that’s pretty much how you can describe Uncharted. It’s there. The actors are all good at what they do, the set pieces are decently put together and very over the top, and there’s a decent bit of humor tying it all together. And not for one minute will you believe any of it, not from the intentional unreality of big-budget Hollywood but the complete lack of anything else. Uncharted isn’t awful, sometimes it’s even fun. But it is kind of soulless, and that’s how you’re likely to feel coming out of it.

"Feb 26, 2022"," With nods to everything from “Raiders of the Lost Ark” to “National Treasure,” it is a film that doesn’t try to stray too far from the genre’s familiar tropes. But what it lacks in originality it makes up for in charm, largely from a cast that is clearly having fun. They make “Uncharted” rather likable – and manage to exceed my rather low expectations. “Uncharted” follows Nathan (Tom Holland), a New York City bartender and grifter looking for his older brother Sam – who left years earlier with a promise to one day return. Nathan meets Sully (Mark Wahlberg), a fortune hunter who claims he was Sam’s former associate. Sully offers to help Nathan find Sam – but only if he helps him on his latest quest, a golden cross linked to Magellan’s voyage around the world. The quest for the cross turns into something much larger. Nathan and Sully travel the world, with everyone from an eccentric billionaire (Antonio Banderas) to hired assassins (Tati Gabrielle) and former associates (Sophia Ali) on their tail. I’m not that familiar with the video game the film is based on, so I can’t say whether this will work for fans of the games (although judging by its huge opening weekend, I suspect it played to that base quite well). The good thing about the film is you don’t have to be a fan of the game to appreciate it. “Uncharted” was directed by Ruben Fleischer, who helmed both of the “Zombieland” films. Fleischer brings the same mixture of action and humor here, keeping the film moving along at a brisk pace. The story does feel a lot like it could have been used for a “National Treasure” sequel, but it is lifted up by a strong cast. It’s nice to see Holland branch out from the “Spider-Man” films, even if Nathan is basically just an adult version of Peter Parker. Wahlberg is also playing a character that we have essentially seen him play hundreds of times, but he settles in so nicely it’s hard to be too critical of his performance. It also helps that Wahlberg and Holland have such natural comic chemistry, that even when the story sputters they can keep things moving along. Banderas also has fun as the main heavy, but Gabrielle and Ali are the standouts in the supporting cast – adding a little bit of depth to characters that could have easily been throwaway roles. It all adds up to a film that hints at being the start of a franchise. This is a fun first step, with Holland and Wahlberg proving to be a delightful pairing.",POSITIVE

"Feb 25, 2022"," Uncharted, currently in theaters, is an action-adventure film based on a popular video game series in which fortune hunters race each other to track down a 500-year-old treasure. The action takes place all over the world, but ironically, considering the name, the film doesn’t take the genre in any new directions. Tom Holland (who most recently played Spider-Man) stars as Nathan Drake, a young pickpocket who believes himself to be descended from the English explorer Sir Francis Drake. Because of the Drake ancestry, Nate’s family has dreamed of finding the world’s greatest treasure, Magellan’s lost gold. Mark Wahlberg plays Sully, another adventurer hunting for the gold who recruits Nate to help him steal the final key needed to discover the treasure’s location. But Nate and Sully aren’t the only ones after Magellan’s treasure. Antonio Banderas plays Santiago Moncada, a wealthy Spanish businessman who believes he’s the rightful owner of the treasure because his family financed Magellan’s expedition 500 years earlier. The stakes are high. Five billion dollars tempts everyone to steal, betray, and murder, and Nate never knows if he’s safe even among his friends. Uncharted, rated PG-13 for action and language, is a pleasant enough film in the vein of Indiana Jones or National Treasure. It has a few humorous moments, but the movie doesn’t contain many surprises. The story plods along, settling for types and tropes we’ve seen before in better movies. Our adventurers solve intricate puzzles laid out in ancient journals making use of priceless relics. They travel to European and Asian locales and run around in crypts and in caves, dodging booby traps and bad guys. The lack of originality is too bad because the Uncharted video game series gained acclaim for its inventive storytelling and engaging characters.  Holland is as likable as ever in this film, and Banderas offers a solid performance. But Wahlberg’s performance suffers from his attempt to play Sully with detached irony. Sully and Nate’s dialogue was meant to sound like witty banter, but Wahlberg’s delivery deprives his lines of the necessary snap and leaves their scenes feeling lifeless—which is a shame in such an energetic movie.  In this movie, Holland isn’t playing Spider-Man, but he flips and twists and jumps as much as he does when wearing the blue-and-red tights. To distract viewers from the lack of plot, Holland moves through scenes in parkour style, spending almost as much time bouncing off walls as he does with his feet on the floor.  Many of the film’s flaws are forgivable because it doesn’t take itself too seriously. These modern-day pirates engage in the most absurd aerial chase scenes I’ve ever seen. If you’re looking for an action adventure unburdened by a coherent story, Uncharted might tide you over until the next superhero installment. Collin is WORLD’s arts and culture editor.

"Feb 24, 2022"," Video game movies get a pretty bum rap. Beyond Silent Hill, you’re not going to find any true-blue stans with academic bona fides of any property that’s made its way from console or PC to the big screen since the PS2 era, but there have been a few decent ones over the half-decade. Rampage was an alright echo of the monster-mash goofiness of the ’80s Godzilla films, and Detective Pikachu was both wonderfully designed as an aesthetic exercise and an exceptionally strange bit of branding that made its way to the screen unmolested by fan complaints (see the uproar over Sonic’s original design for more). But both of those films tried, at least, to offer some sort of cinematic distance from their video game counterparts — sure, Rampage has had a few modern-style updates, and Detective Pikachu was based on a specific game, but if you’re thinking of Rampage and Pokemon, you’re typically thinking of low-fi graphics at either the arcade or on your Game Boy. The real issues come into play when you don’t have any feature that separates the film from the game beyond the presence of famous people in familiar roles. It’s why the Mortal Kombat films had to get exceptionally weird and accurately represent the game’s bizarre lore in order to be compelling because if you’re just going to watch a bunch of shitty fights, you might as well be the one controlling the guy ripping the skull and spine out of Scorpion. This is why making an Uncharted movie was always a decently bad idea, especially when, after a full decade spent in development hell, it made its way down to Ruben Fleischer, he of Zombieland and Venom fame. It’s a fallacy to assume that because something looks cinematic that it will be just as appealing on the big screen, and Fleischer falls face-first into this trap. Uncharted, in Fleischer’s hands, could be more accurately titled The Young Nathan Drake Chronicles, given that this is a prequel to the games — one which totally fucks up the chronology of that world, but whatever — that attempts to tell how treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) met his mentor and, later, best pal Sully (Marky Mark), as well documenting their first big adventure together. We come across young Drake for the first time as a bartender and small-time thief. Being an orphan, who was separated from his brother, Sam, following the pair’s attempted break-in at not-Harvard in Boston, Drake’s had to grow up a lot by himself, managing his life on the mean streets of NYC in ways legal and not (Holland has a pretty swell set of bartender skills, so if they’re ever trying to find a lead for a cocktail remake, he should be first in line). Sully, a treasure “acquisition specialist” and former helicopter pilot, meets him one night in the bar the kid’s working at and offers him a chance at a life of adventure and potential riches. He used to work with Nate’s brother, and he wants the kid’s help tackling the last hunt that Sam ever went on. See, Sam had an idea that Magellan’s ships were full of looted gold, and that if one were to find them, based on clues left by the men who survived the trek, they’d be valued in the billions. So, Nate signs on, and the pair are plunged into a world of intrigue, dodging Sully’s former flame (Tati Gabrielle) and her employer (Antonio Banderas) and entering into a partnership with Chloe (Sophia Ali), a shady yet kind-hearted fellow treasure hunter. On a structural level, Fleischer’s film operates fully within the Marvel mindset of gag-sequence-gag, assisted by plentiful amounts of computer-generated imagery and easter eggs, and Marky Mark’s the only vaguely unstable or interesting element here. In hindsight, it feels weird to point out that he would have been a pretty decent choice to play Drake, back when David O. Russell was circling the project and Barack Obama was still president, though the fanbase made it seem like that casting was a betrayal of the franchise’s ethos. He might not have had the same cadence as Nolan North, the voice actor whose specific inflections and tics gave the character a life uncommonly seen in video games, but he would have been able to play off the treasure hunter’s cocksure attitude with more aplomb than what Holland’s able to do here. He’s not bad, per se, though it’s clear that his time in the Spider-Man trenches has successfully hampered his ability to do anything other than ceaselessly toss out quip and occasionally toss out the sad puppy-dog eyes when he gets betrayed. He’s not playful or mischievous enough to be truly rakish, which is why Marky Mark’s here in the first place. As a result, they can be kind of funny together, at least occasionally, but it’s a faint echo of the games, which have a sense of timing to their quips that Fleischer can only vaguely capture at the best of times.  Yet that’s only a small part of the overall problem with Uncharted. The games’ developer, Naughty Dog has become well-renowned for their visceral and well-constructed setpieces within their releases, which unfold like clockwork, provided that the player can keep up with them, and are delightfully engaging as experiences. The storytelling can be kind of lame and derivative of better cinematic art; the gameplay itself can grow tiresome in the more unfocused moments, like when Drake goes full mass-murderer on mercenaries despite it not being even vaguely hinted at within his character so that players don’t grow too bored; and it can be agonizing to fuck up in the middle of one of those big events and break the flow of the moment. Despite all of that, they’re unique AAA gaming experiences and are incredibly engaging and immersive, rightfully deserving the special place that they hold in the hearts of those who have played through them — or even those who have simply watched the games being played in front of them. So, why on Earth would you ever want to watch a worse live-action version of those experiences, one that’s stuffed to the gills with worse CGI than in the games themselves are made out of and features most of those criticisms mentioned a little earlier? The fights are at least competently staged, but the setpieces, arguably the most essential aspect of an Uncharted experience, are disappointing echoes of the games, each of which made me just wish Fleischer had gone just a little bit smaller with their stunts so that he wouldn’t have to rely so hard on his digital effects team. The era of actually flinging an actor out of a jumbo jet will inevitably come to an end whenever Tom Cruise finally bites the bucket, but an approach that might have let the audience see some feats of real-life daring with tangible risks would have offered a concrete separation from the style of the games, which might have given Uncharted a semi-unique style, at least in comparison to the material it’s based on (it’d be hard to recommend watching Uncharted over even National Treasure, given how ludicrously goofy those movies are, as any comparison to Indiana Jones would come up short). At least the one truly brassy setpiece — an action scene between two pirate ships being airlifted by helicopter, complete with cannonballs and fighters swinging from ship to ship on ropes — is fun enough in concept to allow for some manner of awe-making, but given that it comes a full hour and a half into Uncharted, it’s far little, too late.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 24, 2022"," Parece que ni siquiera tener una fuente de inspiración inherentemente cinematográfica como la saga de “Uncharted” ha ayudado a romper la infame “maldición de las películas de videojuegos”. No me tomen a mal; no es que la película de “Uncharted” sea terrible. De hecho, para estándares del subgénero, está bastante bien, y de hecho podría ser considerada como una de las mejores adaptaciones hasta ahora, junto a “Detective Pikachu”, “Sonic”, “Silent Hill” y “Prince of Persia”. Pero no puedo evitar pensar que pudo haber sido mejor… más fiel a los juegos, más compleja, y hasta más ambiciosa. Ciertamente no ayuda que algunos fanáticos se vayan a molestar con los cambios realizados en “Uncharted”. La película sirve como una suerte de precuela para los juegos, incluyendo elementos de los cuatro títulos, desde secuencias de acción hasta personajes y locaciones. Y en vez de tener a un Nathan Drake y un Sully como los de los juegos, el filme nos presenta versiones más jóvenes de los personajes, las cuales no siempre tratan de emular a sus fuentes de inspiración. Es interesante; “Uncharted” es relativamente fiel a los juegos de manera superficial, como si estuviera activamente intentando no fastidiar a los fanáticos. Pero a la vez, cuenta con tantos cambios y adiciones y licencias creativas, que para muchos podría no ser considerada como parte del canon. “Uncharted” comienza in medias res, recurso que vimos en los juegos, pero que para efectos de la película, no sirve de mucho. Luego pasamos a un flashback en los 90s, donde un joven Nathan Drake es separado de su hermano mayor, Sam. Y luego de eso, por fin, llegamos al “presente”, donde un (todavía joven, pero no tanto) Drake (Tom Holland) trabaja de bartender en un bar en Nueva York, utilizando sus considerables habilidades para robarle joyas a la gente. Es ahí, de hecho, donde Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) lo encuentra, ofreciéndole la oportunidad de adentrarse en una aventura, en busca de un tesoro perdido. Inicialmente, Nathan rechaza la oferta, pero la posibilidad de descubrir tanto oro (y de reencontrarse con su hermano, quien hasta hace poco estuvo trabajando con Sully) es demasiado tentadora. Es así, pues, que Nate y Sully viajan a Barcelona, siguiendo una serie de pistas dejadas siglos antes, y asociándose con la suspicaz Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), otra cazadora de tesoros. Pero como se deben imaginar, ellos no son los únicos en busca del oro. El millonario Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) ha enviado a sus secuaces, liderados por la letal Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), tras el rastro de nuestros héroes, interesado en un tesoro que él cree siempre debió ser propiedad de su familia. “Uncharted” no tiene miedo de admitir cuáles son sus influencias; no solo está basada en una serie famosísima de juegos, si no que mencionan a Indiana Jones en el diálogo, y contiene elementos muy similares a los de las películas de “En busca del Tesoro Perdido”, con Nicolas Cage. Intenta ser, pues, una película de acción y aventura bien a la antigua, un pastiche del cine Hollywoodiense ochenteno, el cual a su vez era un pastiche de las seriales de aventuras de los años 30… las cuales, a su vez, estaban basadas en las novelas de acción tipo pulp de principios del siglo pasado. Los efectos visuales se han tornado más complejos y la acción más frenética, pero en términos básicos, “Uncharted” es una película bien a la antigua. Lo cual, desgraciadamente, sí hace que se sienta un poco genérica. Las películas de “Indiana Jones” lograron obtener un estilo propio gracias al carisma y personalidad de su protagonista, y a los increíblemente detestables que eran sus antagonistas. Incluso una película como “La Momia” (una de mis favoritas de toda la vida) resalta gracias a su sentido del humor, y a un villano absolutamente memorable. “Uncharted”, por su parte, nunca llega a estar al mismo nivel que aquellas producciones. Sorprende, por ejemplo, que el Santiago Moncada de Antonio Banderas (súper desperdiciado) sea tan soso, su historia de trasfondo curiosamente subdesarrollada, y su rol en el clímax decepcionantemente breve. La Braddock de Tati Gabrielle la pasa un poco mejor, pero tampoco es que sea particularmente interesante. Y aunque la química entre Holland y Wahlberg es palpable… nunca llegan a sentirse como Nathan Drake y Victor Sullivan. Holland, carismático y adorablemente torpe, es simplemente demasiado inocentón para ser Drake, y Wahlberg interpreta a Sully como… Mark Wahlberg. Quien sí logra convertirse en su personaje, más bien, es Sophia Ali, que interpreta a Chloe como alguien que no confía en nadie, siempre consciente de que la podrían traicionar en cualquier momento. No es el personaje más complejo del mundo, pero Ali lo interpreta de manera encantadora, resaltando su fisicalidad, pero también su fuerte personalidad. Por otra parte, las secuencias de acción son… cumplidoras. La mejor definitivamente es la que se lleva a cabo en el aire, el Nate de Holland cayéndose de un avión y saltando de caja en caja, deshaciéndose de secuaces que no cuentan con su agilidad o picardía. No, no luce particularmente realista, pero dentro de la ficción de la película, una suerte de realidad aumentada y exagerada, funciona. El resto de secuencias, aunque suficientemente emocionantes, abusan un poco de las cámaras en mano, y curiosamente, no incluyen muchos tiroteos (una característica de los juegos que, a estas alturas, ya es un meme, debido a los cientos de personas que Nate mata en cada entrega). Y los acertijos, sin ser particularmente difíciles (involucran cruces de oro, llaves y… un Papa John’s en Barcelona… ¡yee, product placement!), le otorgan algo de variedad e intriga a la narrativa. “Uncharted” cuenta con suficientes easter eggs y referencias a los juegos, como para dar la impresión de que sus creadores le tienen algo de respeto al material original. Y para quienes sepan poco o nada sobre videojuegos o empresas como Naughty Dog o PlayStation, se sentirá como una película entretenida de aventuras y tesoros; nada especial, pero nada ofensivo, tampoco. Sin embargo, los fanáticos de “Uncharted” probablemente queden con sentimientos encontrados; la película mezcla varios elementos de los juegos y es bastante emocionante por momentos, pero a la vez, no cuenta con villanos particularmente memorables ni con protagonistas que se parezcan a los originales. “Uncharted” es un filme decente (y para estándares del cine de videojuegos, hasta bueno), pero ciertamente pudo ser mejor.

"Feb 24, 2022"," When a movie starts with its protagonist awakening while falling from a great height, after which he dodges assailants on a string of dangling cargo boxes and is hit by a car falling out of a plane...its aims couldn't be clearer. So, no, Uncharted isn’t trying to cure cancer — it’s too focused on delivering popcorn entertainment in the vein of the National Treasure movies and Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, and succeeding marvelously at that mission. The adaptation of the popular video game series finds a winning partner in director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland; Venom), who’s starting to corner the market on cheeky adventure/comedies.  As aforementioned accidental skydiver Nathan Drake, Tom Holland makes for a convincing thief with encyclopedic knowledge, and exhibits charming rapport with Mark Wahlberg, bouncing back nicely from his recent series of duds as Victor Sullivan, a fellow “appreciator of antiquities” and former colleague of Nate’s M.I.A. brother Sam. Nathan’s early character-building NYC bartending skills and pickpocket antics scale up nicely to the duo’s quest for Ferdinand Magellan’s lost treasure, which finds them globe-trotting while attempting to evade the evil Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his thugs. Joined In Spain by the potentially untrustworthy Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, Grey’s Anatomy), Nate and Sully go full Indiana Jones, and while the puzzle-solving may be a tad overly familiar, the banter by Iron Man scribes Art Marcum and Matt Holloway and TV writer Rafe Judkins stays fresh and Fleischer dishes out creative action sequences, the likes of which have viewers have never seen. The steady forward motion is so effective that one doesn’t want the good times to end. Fortunately, audiences who appreciate such tried-and-true escapism with shiny new coats of paint seem destined to make Uncharted a hit, and further missions for Nate and Sully appear certain.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2022"," The Uncharted franchise is known for already being a love letter to films of the globe-trotting adventure genre, so how could this have gone wrong? When faced with the question of why a film adaptation of a video game exists in 2022, the reasons become  disappointingly simple. Where, early on, there were limited ways to envision games through sounds and chiptune music, and films could fully realize them beyond their own medium, we’ve reached a point where the lines of both have begun to blur. Now, much like adapting anime to live action, one of the very few reasons to do so with known video game properties is to expand the brand to a non-game playing audience.The resulting film of such an effort on Sony’s part is an over baked, overwritten studio production that fails to capture the soul of both the fifteen year legacy of one of modern gaming’s most iconic main characters, as well as being a disservice to the Hollywood films that inspired that franchise in the first place. It is a movie that sure does look and sound like Uncharted on its surface, but that’s because, through a bad game of telephone, we’re seeing a watered down interpretation of what Naughty Dog was trying to achieve in their game series. The games made their claim to fame by being loving homages to Indiana Jones, but with bigger set pieces, parkour and the novelty of player engagement, and all through the lens of pushing the limits of what a PlayStation console could do at the time. When players gawk at the visual design and graphical fidelity of a game like Uncharted 4 upon its release, it’s the same sensation people felt with each latest Christopher Nolan or James Cameron film. While watching Nathan Drake fumble about, crack jokes, shoot large men in leather coats and scrounge for treasure is fun, An Uncharted story is always carried by the massive weight of Naughty Dog’s developers pushing the limits of technical spectacle with the results being comparable to watching IMAX from the comfort of your sofa. There is a rich history of good character work that the games’ directors Amy Hennig and Niel Druckman built. The film attempts to draw from the well, steering this ten year vessel of development hell towards a focus away from inventive spectacle and instead on an origin story arc for Tom Holland’s Nathan Drake. Screenwriters Matt Holloway, Arm Macum (Transformers The Last Knight, Men In Black International) and Rafe Judkins (Amazon’s Wheel of Time) try to endear the audience to Nathan through setting up a backstory with his lost brother Sam, learning the harsh world of thieving from Mark Whalberg’s passionless interpretation of Victor Sullivan, and discerning whether to trust peers in the treasure hunters world like Sofa Ali (The Wilds) as fan favorite character Chloe Frazer. While Tom Holland initially seems a bit young for the part, leaning into his wanting to reconnect with his older brother after going missing for ten years is a simple enough character motivation to drive the audience through this journey to finish their wide eyed dream of hunting for the treasure of Ferdinand Magellan’s crew across the globe. However, the film also gets caught in a quest to keep audiences on their toes, putting Nathan on a path of learning never to trust anyone when working in a thief’s line of work. While interesting on paper, it keeps internal conflict so face-forward between our main characters that it drags down the pacing of the film, with a few too many twists contributing to an exhaustive runtime even though it clocks in under two hours. Casting Mark Wahlberg in the film might make sense on a marketing meeting, but in order for a young actor like Tom Holland to work as a co-lead with an older mentor like he did with Robert Downey Jr, you need a character actor with more natural comradery with Holland to really sell the dynamic of treasure thieving partners, but what is on screen is more stilted even some clunky game cutscene animations. A character like Victor Sullivan was based on the likes of Bruce Campbell and Burt Reynolds, and while Mark Wahlberg can banter, having him mentor Tom Holland feels like taking Jason Bateman and making him co-lead as two leads in a straight man role. It’s hard to say whether it was purely miscasting or the comfortability of the two on screen hasn’t been worked out yet, but its unfortunately that the rapport between the two is at its best in an isolated post credits scene that is already in the trailer for the films anyway. Credit can be given to Tom Holland, however, who really is beginning to show reach as he comes of age that he holds the same cinematic presence thought long past, easily comparable to Harrison Ford. But while Ford was given carte blanche to be charismatic on screen, Holland as Drake is unable to capture the smugness and confidence the character is supposed to embody, and even though we see stunts that use what he’s learned on the Marvel films, we never get to see Drake do treacherous free solo climbing or grand escape sequences.  It says a lot that the most standout set piece of the film is the only one adapted directly in one of the games, and we technically see it twice. It also speaks volumes that characters fighting for control in a climactic sequence in which two ships being helicarried over the east indies comes across as kind of dull. While admirable that the film tries to justify its existence through mostly original content or different interpretations of characters, the attempt to do so keeps the Uncharted film from feeling like Uncharted. The Uncharted games are known for being the perfect summation of what anybody loves about the adventure genre, and they at least understand what makes Indiana Jones work: fun, charismatic characters and old-school production values. When a third-hand adaptation instead makes the characters jerks to one another, and the sets and stunts feel more rubbery and unrealistic than actual video games despite, in 2022, using the same exact technology to render and composite sets and scenery, the long sigh comes along followed by the question for the millionth time: why bother adapting a video game that’s already trying to be like a movie? If you haven’t yet, play Uncharted 4, or watch a let’s play of it as though it were an animated film. The reasons for which  it’s better is so immediately apparent.

"Feb 23, 2022"," The game might be uncharted. The movie is not. This generic action-adventure pic covers familiar ground, with a script scavenged from Raiders of the Lost Ark, Pirates of the Caribbean and the National Treasure franchise. The result is serviceable but soulless. Spider-Man’s Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, a bartender, amateur historian and thief. He might steal things, but Holland’s easy charm and contagious keenness soon convince us he’s essentially a good guy. (Plus, he only pilfers from trust-fund kids.) One night at the bar, Nathan is approached by Vincent (Sully) Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a veteran treasure hunter who plans to steal a 16th-century Spanish gold key he believes will unlock a cache of gold hidden by the Magellan expedition. Sully also claims to know Nathan’s older brother, Sam. Sully only cares about the gold, but Nathan wants to find out what happened to Sam, who took off when they were kids in a Catholic orphanage. Before he left, Sam reminded Nathan they were descendants of Sir Francis Drake, born to be explorers and pirates. Cue the gold-key caper, with Sully and Nathan coming up against Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), whose ancient Spanish family bankrolled the Magellan expedition — plus the Crusades, the Inquisition and Franco’s fascist regime — and who believes the gold is rightfully his. Complicating matters even further are Moncada’s right-hand woman, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), and Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), an independent operator with unclear loyalties. Uncharted really works the “no honour among thieves” theme, and at any moment it’s hard to know whether Nathan, Sully and Chloe are working together or getting ready for a double-cross.  There’s no chemistry among the leads, though, so what’s supposed to be spirited banter often feels more like bickering. A lot of the script’s comic quips just hang there. There are some casting issues. Wahlberg and Banderas are both supposed to be international men of mystery, suave and worldly, but only one convinces — and I bet you can guess which one. (The Uncharted project has been in development since 2008, when Wahlberg was initially considered for the star part of Nathan Drake, which might account for his somewhat disengaged attitude here.) There are clever puzzles, including a Dan Brown-like selection of maps and codes and hidden messages, but the audience doesn’t really get a chance to participate, the drawback of watching a video game instead of playing it. The action sequences — including a struggle in a plane’s open cargo hatch, a journey through booby-trapped tunnels beneath Barcelona and a contemporary pirate battle in the Banda Sea — are derivative but often effective. Holland is the real draw here. He, at least, is having enough fun onscreen that he brings us along, too — and if a teased end-credit sequence is anything to go by, the studio is hoping he’s headed for a sequel.

"Feb 23, 2022"," Take Indiana Jones' first adventure, “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” strip away the clever dialogue, remove the richly drawn characterizations, disregard superb casting, dispense with internal logic, kill the suspense and any sense of actual danger, ignore nuanced pacing, then employ sophomoric slow-motion shots. The ever-adorable Tom Holland - the only Hollywood Spider-Man to accurately capture the adolescent essence of high school student Peter Parker - stars as Nathan Drake, a buff Manhattan bartender and petty thief with an encyclopedic knowledge of ancient treasures. One night while trying to top Tom Cruise's bartending showmanship from “Cocktail,” Nathan gets approached by soldier-of-collectible-fortunes Victor (call me “Sully”) Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to help him find the fabled lost gold of Magellan. They embark on a grand adventure that takes them to Barcelona and the Philippines where they race to locate the treasure before the villainous Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas, emanating slow-burn evil) beats them to it. His ancestors funded Magellan's trip, so Moncada feels entitled to the spoils before they go to the Victor. In Barcelona, Nathan and Sully meet up with another professional thief Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who trusts neither of them, but as the trio sprints through booby-trapped ancient mazes adorned with the standard-issue dust and cobwebs, these three generic action figures learn to work together. Meanwhile, a svelte, knife-wielding assassin named Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, alias Prudence from the Netflix horror series “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”) lurks in and out of the shadows, waiting to pounce and slash. The original, highly immersive “Uncharted” series (four games plus a few spinoff projects) would seem to be perfect fodder for a motion picture franchise, which Fleischer's movie has clearly been set up to become. (Note the two post-credits scenes tacked on in a wishful Marvel Cinematic Universe fashion.) But the blandly utilitarian screenplay by three writers (who apparently were paid by the number of times they used the word “trust”) gives the actors precious little help in building fleshed-out, interesting characters. Even so, Wahlberg, a graduate from the Acting School of Perpetual Scowling, delivers his lines in monotoned boredom, which makes you wonder how he was ever considered to play Nathan back in an aborted 2010 “Uncharted.” The energetic, watchable Holland fares only slightly better in a series of action showpieces that, strung together, constitute the bulk of this thin narrative, complete with fortune cookie clues written on cryptic postcards from Nathan's missing brother Sam. Nathan and Sully may be super smart, but this movie treats the audience as super stupid, or at least so inattentive to details that the filmmakers needn't bother with those. In Barcelona, Sully desperately tries to get through a barred manhole cover down to a secret chamber where Nathan thinks he's about to find the gold of Magellan. He's knocked unconscious. The film's flashiest showcased sequence - Nathan desperately clings to a string of connected baggage pieces dangling in the air behind an airplane - is so good, we get to see most of it twice.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 23, 2022"," Uncharted Synopsis: Treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) recruits street-smart Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) to help him recover a 500-year-old lost fortune amassed by explorer Ferdinand Magellan. What starts as a heist soon becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Santiago Moncada can get his hands on it. The perilous adventures of Nathan Drake cemented the Uncharted franchise as an undeniable video game staple. Packaging the death-defying thrills and intriguing exploration of Indiana Jones for a modern age, Uncharted conjured a grand sense of adventure similar to its big-screen counterparts across five video games.  I luckily discovered the Uncharted franchise shortly after purchasing my PlayStation 4 and fell in love with its conceits. Developer Naughty Dog demonstrated a remarkable balance of pulse-pounding thrills with nuanced and emotionally-evolving storytelling. While several big-screen blockbusters tried to conjure the adventurous spirit of old-school staples, Uncharted resonated as one of the few adaptations to capture that energy effectively.  Considering the franchise’s success, it’s no surprise that Sony continues to attempt big-screen interpretations of Drake and his company of endearing thieves. Projects with David O. Russell and Limitless director Neil Burger involved ultimately crashed by the wayside as the brand endured a decade-plus in development hell. Like one of the lost relics Drake endlessly searches for, Uncharted seemed destined for an existence in adaptation purgatory.  Nearly 15 years after the first game, Uncharted finally makes its big-screen debut. Touting two Hollywood stars and a globe-trotting premise, Sony appears to set this adaptation up for big-screen success. It may rank in the dough financially, but Sony’s wayward cinematic interpretation of Uncharted reeks of cynicism and presents an inept understanding of its source material.  I frequently find myself in the role of a video game movie apologist, often advocating for misunderstood critical duds, like Tomb Raider and Monster Hunter, that possess an assured understanding of their source material. Viewed in the same adaptation context, Uncharted’s embrace of generic formula makes a mockery of the franchise’s noble narrative ambitions.  Matt Holloway, Rafe Judkins, and Art Marcum, a trio of screenwriter-for-hire personas, are dealt the complicated task of introducing the franchise to a new audience while paying tribute to its small-screen origins. It’s an assignment that the trio completely butcher, although I am sure studio tampering also played a significant role. The trio admitted to borrowing most inspiration from Uncharted 4: A Thieve’s End, which served as the last chapter in Nathan Drake’s adventure franchise.  Even newcomers to Uncharted can see the innate flaws in that approach. Several integral subplots to that game, including Nathan’s search for his long-lost brother, present themselves without the thematic substance that made them so effective. The movie comes off as a weirdly assembled hodgepodge of narrative beats and iconography from the games, elements that the screenplay blends into a poorly-balanced concoction of “remember this in the games” moments. As an experience, it doesn’t hold a candle to the captivating storytelling the Uncharted meticulously crafted over several games.  Much dismay is already out there about the film’s questionable casting choices. Spider-Man star Tom Holland serves as a capable-enough protagonist, but the actor struggles to convey Nathan’s distinct characteristics. Holland and the film neuter Nathan into an energetic puppy dog who stumbles into the life of an adventurer. In contrast, voice actor Nolan North conveyed rich textures under the character’s charismatic bravado. The games never shied away from Nathan’s selfish and egotistical falterings, which helped create a well-rounded lead for audiences to rally behind. Holland’s interpretation leaves viewers with nothing more than bland eagerness.  Other characters from the game come off as bizarre distortions of the source material. Mark Wahlberg is solely cast here for his marketability, with the actor’s typical machismo shtick serving zero relation to Sully’s suave personality. Where the games portrayed Nathan and Sully as intimately-entangled loners who seek solace in one another, Holland and Wahlberg relegate their relationship into a series of humorless one-liners. Sophia Ali presents some occasional charms as the enigmatic Chole Frazer, but the role strips the character of her agency and personality.  I can forgive haphazard adaptation choices if the film in its place creates its own inspired vision. Uncharted certainly doesn’t achieve that. Director Ruben Fleischer and his team present bland aesthetic choices that rarely liven the familiar adventure movie mold. The entire affair feels lifeless in its pursuits, sticking to the bare minimum of blockbuster formula despite adapting a canvas that’s ripe with excitement and inspired ideas.  Uncharted is equivalent to a bad TV pilot. The film introduces a new world of characters and ideas without giving viewers a single reason to invest. Executed without creativity or thought, it’s a film that properly lives up to the bad misnomers surrounding video game movies.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Feb 23, 2022"," Uncharted is a swashbuckling good time—a film that deviates in some ways from the video games, but sticks to their spirit, aesthetic and themes in every way that counts. While I never pictured Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, he works quite well as a younger version of the treasure hunter we’ve come to know and love in the PlayStation exclusives from Naughty Dog. The movie version differs in many ways from the games, but draws from them in all the ways that count: There are familiar set-pieces—the plane, the lost pirate ship, the Catholic orphanage—and scenarios—Nathan’s long-lost brother, Sam and the mystery surrounding his disappearance—and, of course, the cast of beloved characters. While Mark Wahlberg’s Victor “Sully” Sullivan is quite a bit different from the video game version, I was actually pleasantly surprised by his performance. Wahlberg and Holland play well off one another, and as a “young Drake” and “young Sully” pairing, they pull it off. Again, we’re in “spirit of the games” territory here more than simply the look. Holland doesn’t really look like Nathan Drake and Wahlberg doesn’t really look like Sully, but they still manage to bring the duo to life. Unlike the games, this is the story of the beginning of their partnership (and friendship) rather than a relationship that’s been built up over decades. I liked the rest of the cast as well. Sophia Ali as Chloe Frazer, and Tati Gabrielle as the villain, Jo Braddock, are both solid casting choices, though Braddock never really becomes anything more than a one-note villain. As for the rest of the movie, it sits nicely in the “big cinematic action-adventure-treasure-heist” genre that the Uncharted games occupy. The story isn’t anything to write home about, but it’s perfectly fine and entertaining. There’s plenty of double-crossing, lots of jaw-dropping action and a good dose of humor throughout. One thing I think the film does incredibly well is capture the spirit of puzzle-solving and tomb-raiding that the Uncharted game franchise is known for. It’s a pitch-perfect rendition of the many absurd puzzles we encounter in the games. I always ask myself, “What kind of pirate buries their treasure and then concocts all these incredibly meticulous, over-the-top puzzles and booby-traps just to find the map?” It’s absurd but in a fun, engrossing way—just like the games, which themselves are based off of Indiana Jones and The Goonies and other similar adventure stories, all of which I also love. To be fair, I’m not sure I’d place Uncharted the movie on the same pedestal as Indiana Jones or The Goonies, but then again this is just the first outing in what I hope becomes a new movie franchise. The movie has clearly been set up with a sequel in mind, and I can imagine it growing into its own shoes, so to speak. Also, any critic worth their salt should remember that the pedestal we place classic films on is one bulwarked by nostalgia. A child who grows up on Holland’s Uncharted may look back on it with the same fondness I look back on The Last Crusade (though how can you beat Harrison Ford and Sean Connery as Indiana and his father?) It’s not a perfect movie, no doubt, with perhaps a bit too much reliance on CGI and incompetent bad guys, but overall I enjoyed it a great deal. It also did two things better than the games: Not as much climbing and not as much shooting. I’ll have more to say about that in a separate piece. As you can see, I am in the minority of critics on this one—but well within the majority when it comes to the audience reaction. This is a huge disparity, too. Just 40% of critics give Uncharted a passing grade, while 90% of viewers enjoyed the film. The movie’s Cinema Score rating is “B+” which, while not as good as an “A” obviously, is still well above what we’d expect from such a Rotten tomato. The action-disaster film Moonfall, for instance, received a 38% critic score on RT, with a 70% audience score—and a C+ Cinema Score (which is based on polling audiences directly as they leave theaters) . Viewers are not as happy with that one as they are Uncharted, though still generally more positive than critics. But the critical reception is almost identical to Uncharted. Actually, there’s not much to report about the why behind critics’ distaste for this film. Many just found it bland or mediocre. Some critics who were fans of the games thought it didn’t live up to the source material, which is fair enough, though I think it’s pretty hard to adapt a video game and this one has more faithfully than most. Others called it an “Indiana Jones wannabee” which, well, yeah that’s kind of the point. I wondered if we’d see any commentary on the fact that two white dudes were the heroes of the story while a Latin guy and a black chick were the villains—but I haven’t seen any so far, so that’s good! I think it’s great to see a diverse cast, regardless of who plays the hero and who plays the villain (which is also why I’m not swayed by arguments that movies like Black Widow are somehow anti-male). I have noticed, in the past, certain ideological bents to these wildly disparate critic and audience scores. When I wrote about Ghostbusters: Afterlife for this very reason, I touched on this same question. Some critics still seemed angry that the all-female Ghostbusters didn’t make a splash, and viewed the new picture as revanchist (in ways it really wasn’t at all). All that culture war nonsense that plagued the first Ghostbusters reboot carried over to this one, and more’s the pity. Again, I’m not going to say that Uncharted was the perfect movie, but as far as video game adaptations go it was a solid effort, and felt very true to the games. I think I went in with pretty low expectations, and ended up being pleasantly surprised. I think a “B+” is about right, though grading on a “video game adaptation” curve I’d go a bit higher. P.S. It’s interesting that 2018’s Tomb Raider reboot scored so evenly among critics and audiences, with the former at 52% and the latter at 55% on Rotten Tomatoes. I thought that was a really good adaptation of the rebooted video game franchise, and I think Walton Goggins’s Mathias Vogel was a far more interesting villain than any of Uncharted’s bad guys.  But what that film lacked, Uncharted has in spades: Namely, the Drake/Sully duo and a lot of exciting tomb-raiding / puzzle-solving. But I enjoyed Tomb Raider also, if not quite as much. And not just because I’m an Alicia Vikander fanboy, either, though she did a terrific job as Lara Croft. Both Uncharted and Tomb Raider strike me as solid first entries in potentially very fun film franchises. Fortunately, Tomb Raider’s sequel is still in the works, now under the stewardship of Lovecraft Country’s Misha Green; and Uncharted is a box-office hit, leading Motion Picture Group Chairman and CEO Tom Rothman to call it a “a new hit movie franchise.” Now we just have to wait until 2023 for HBO’s The Last Of Us, the second Naughty Dog game series to be adapted, this time for the small-screen. Don’t expect as many laughs, or as many hijinks, with the Pedro Pascal-led drama, however. While Uncharted can go dark sometimes, The Last Of Us basically lives in darkness.",POSITIVE
"Feb 23, 2022"," Following the colossal success of the most recent cycle of Spider-Man films, someone has reached the conclusion that what the public is clamouring for is more of Tom Holland, suspended mid-air. In the treasure hunt adventure-comedy Uncharted, based on the similarly successful video game series of the same name, he dangles from ropes, light fittings and a Spanish galleon that is being transported by helicopter. He also gets to race over rooftops, solve puzzles like the ones in The Da Vinci Code and show off his bartending flair like Tom Cruise in Cocktail, all in the cocky yet apologetic manner he’s made his own. Basically, the point is to come up with material that feels action-adventure-y without being too violent, since Uncharted is meant as entertainment for the whole family to a greater extent than, say, the otherwise similar Red Notice, which recently premiered on Netflix. Holland is in his mid 20s, but his Uncharted character Nathan Drake is preserved, like Tintin, in adolescence, while his older comrade Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) serves as a mix of babysitter and dubious mentor. Nathan and Sully aren’t exactly pals, but they’re obsessed with the same legendary hoard of gold, associated with 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan. Starting out in New York, they follow the trail of clues to Barcelona and beyond, while tangling with rivals including two even less trustworthy young women (Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle) and a ruthless yet hapless villain played by a lost-looking Antonio Banderas. It’s all mildly amusing, mildly exciting and entirely routine, just as you might expect from a director such as the reliably faceless Ruben Fleischer (Venom), who manages to go from one hit to the next without ever showing any particular talent. The action sequences are zany in theory but nondescript in practice, especially when you picture how a concept such as the flying galleon might have been handled by a director with some slapstick flair (say, Gore Verbinski, best-known for the earlier Pirates of the Caribbean films). Likewise, even by the standards of the genre, the characters are tissue-paper thin. From the outset, it’s indicated what Nate is really seeking is a replacement for his long-lost older brother Sam (played by Rudy Pankow in a prologue). But there’s no real emotional payoff to this plot point – only an indication that the theme will be carried further in a sequel, which seems like cheating. Sully has even less in the way of motivation. He’s just a guy who wants to get rich quick, and has chosen an extremely roundabout way of doing so. Still, Wahlberg has the knack of combining wiseguy cynicism with hints of boyish vulnerability: Sully’s joyful smile when he thinks he’s reached his goal is almost touching. Basically, this is a performance he’s given many times over. But like other old pros Fleischer has counted on in the past, such as Woody Harrelson and Bill Murray in the Zombieland films, he knows how to deliver what we’ve come to see.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 22, 2022"," Sony Pictures’ Uncharted wastes little time putting Nathan Drake (played by Tom Holland) in the thick of the action, opening with the treasure hunter dangling from a crate that is already dangling from a cargo plane. (All that’s missing is Drake doing the record-scratch, freeze-frame meme.) Time and gravity aren’t on Drake’s side—he has to climb the unstable crates and make his way back onto the plane, all while avoiding the nameless henchmen risking their own (apparently meaningless?) lives to stop him. As far as kicking off an aspiring action-adventure franchise goes, Uncharted hits a sweet spot: Audiences unfamiliar with the video game series of the same name should be able to get invested in a film in which Peter Parker is one false step from falling tens of thousands of feet to his doom, while fans will appreciate that one of the games’ most breathtaking sequences has been brought to life on the big screen.  Among the ever-growing canon of video game adaptations, which will include a Sonic the Hedgehog sequel, a Halo TV show, an HBO series based on The Last of Us, and a BioShock movie at Netflix, Uncharted seemed to be the ideal franchise to receive the blockbuster treatment because it already felt like one by design. The thrill of Uncharted was how, from the quippy cutscenes to the narrative-driven gameplay, everything about the games felt cinematic—the sensation that the player was an active participant in their own adrenaline-pumping movie. Instead of watching Indiana Jones, you are Indiana Jones.  The blockbuster vibes of Uncharted weren’t lost on gamers: Nathan Fillion was long considered the dream casting for Drake, and the actor responded by campaigning for the role on Twitter and even appearing in a fan-made short film opposite Stephen Lang, who played the character’s mustachioed mentor Victor “Sully” Sullivan. But as studios kicked the tires on an Uncharted film adaptation for years, the lead role ultimately fell into the lap of Holland, a rising star half as old as Fillion. (Sully, meanwhile, would be played by Mark Wahlberg, who was once in line to play Drake and is now … as old as Fillion.) That the movie spent more than a decade in development hell, during which Uncharted launched über-popular sequels on the way to becoming one of the most celebrated video game franchises of all time, fueled hype for the adaptation even further.  But the strange thing about turning Uncharted into a successful tentpole is that the blueprint already has been established: The Indiana Jones franchise is proof of concept that a treasure hunter—er, “archeologist”—makes for a riveting action hero. While other video game adaptations have to learn how to translate their material into a new medium—and history hasn’t been kind to them—Uncharted could follow the map that other action-adventure movies have, well, charted. (See also: National Treasure, The Adventures of Tintin, the Brendan Fraser–led Mummy trilogy.) But the well-worn path of the subgenre is also a double-edged sword: Now that Uncharted has become a blockbuster of its own, what actually makes it distinct from the action-adventure franchises that came before it?  Once Uncharted establishes that Shit Will Go Down on a cargo plane, the film hits pause on the action to flesh out Drake’s backstory. A self-described descendant of the British explorer Sir Francis Drake, Drake grew up in an orphanage with his older brother Sam (Outer Banks’ Rudy Pankow), who later ran away to avoid getting arrested for breaking into a museum. Years later, Drake is recruited by Sully, who worked with Sam before he was (supposedly) killed, to hunt down a billion dollars worth of gold hidden by the Magellan expedition. In the race for Magellan’s lost treasure, Drake and Sully have to deal with the villainous Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), himself a descendant of one of the expedition’s explorers, as well as fellow treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who only looks out for herself among thieves.  Despite more adaptations being green-lit than ever before, Hollywood has continued to struggle when it comes to cracking the video game code. (To be fair, some strides have been made on television.) But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t important lessons to take from Uncharted’s underwhelming translation to the big screen. With iconic Hollywood influences baked into its globe-trotting premise, Uncharted appeared destined to be the One Video Game Adaptation to Rule Them All. But now that another great franchise has failed to live up to the hype, there’s even more evidence that what makes a movie succeed and what makes a video game succeed may be mutually exclusive—no matter how much DNA they seem to share.

"Feb 22, 2022"," My favorite movie genre is action adventure, and it’s rare to find a big studio film that gets it as right as “Uncharted.” Based on the popular PlayStation video games, this high energy story of treasure hunters is exciting and a ton of fun. While it doesn’t quite meet the gold standard of the best of the best in the genre (“National Treasure,” “The Goonies,” “The Mummy,” “Raiders of the Lost Ark”), it’s definitely hovering close to the same ballpark. This is the kind of movie that critics will love to hate just because audiences rate it close to a perfect 10. While tending bar at work, petty thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is approached by seasoned fortune seeker Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) in an attempt to recruit him for a side gig. Sully needs help recovering Ferdinand Magellan’s pirate ships filled with gold that was lost over 500 years ago, and he thinks Nathan is just the man he needs at his side. As the two decipher clues, they embark on a jet-setting trip around the world in a race to be the first to the treasure. It’s a great story, and no knowledge of the video game on which it is based is necessary. Wahlberg and Holland have a nice chemistry, and their banter is silly but amusing. They are both likeable actors on their own but when working together, they are a powerhouse onscreen duo. The supporting cast includes several strong female characters (Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle), all clever and a bit ruthless in their own right, and none of which need to be rescued. These are solid characters, but admittedly, the action sometimes overpowers them. Director Ruben Fleischer knows how to film thrilling action set pieces and although the scenarios faced are ridiculous, they still offer supersized fun. From an outrageous extended scene that culminates in a vintage Mercedes plummeting from a cargo plane to a helicopter flying pirate ships out of an overgrown jungle, the execution is unforgettable. Even the standard Indiana Jones style of exploring dark caves with torches and studying treasure maps for clues is done well here.  Despite a couple of missteps in fight choreography (especially Gabrielle, who isn’t very good at acting like a combat pro), the physical stunts are high quality. Ditto for the extravagant CGI and special effects, which look near-flawless. The film is rated PG-13 so the violence and blood are muted, and there are no sex scenes or cursing, which in a way is refreshing. The script is detailed without feeling generic, and if you are willing to suspend disbelief, you’ll enjoy the ride a lot more. I can’t think of much to criticize about “Uncharted.” Not only is it extremely well done, it kept me smiling for two solid hours. This movie is awesome and exactly what I am looking for when it comes to a big budget action adventure. It delivers a guaranteed good time at the movies.",POSITIVE

Nathan  is smart and well-read. He knows his history (not unlike a certain Harrison Ford character), so he’s a perfect match for Sully, who has an eye for the ladies but who never stops thinking about his agenda. The two plot a wild theft of a golden cross at a Soho auction. After that, the pair begin their adventures traveling the globe (true to the spirit of the game) to find the clues and the resources to get to the loot. The film is exactly what you think it will be: a blander version of movies that came before it.

"Feb 22, 2022"," Well, it’s happened. After thirty years of trying, video games movies have finally reached the middle. Uncharted, the globe-trotting Indiana Jones-riff adventure game, comes to the big screen at last, starring Tom Holland as a young, just-starting-out adventurer, Nathan Drake, and Mark Wahlberg as his shady mentor, Sully. It is in every way middling, just an absolute mediocrity of a movie, but after thirty years of video game movies so bad people dubbed them “cursed”, that’s a rousing achievement in the genre. Video game movies are no longer the worst thing in the world, they’re now as average as your run of the mill studio blockbuster effort. Great work, everyone. Buoyed by Tom Holland’s irrepressible charm, Uncharted jogs past at a reasonable two hours, obviously skinned down to its most action-forward version, though if director Ruben Fleischer really wanted to make this a run-and-gun adventure, he could’ve skimmed a solid twenty more minutes off it. Still, with Holland charming and chirping his way through a script that veers between ludicrous action set pieces and completely hollow “emotional” beats, Uncharted goes down relatively easily. Once upon a time, this is exactly the kind of movie you’d stumble across on a Saturday afternoon while folding laundry, and half-watch contentedly while sort of doing something else. It’s a little bit a waste of Holland’s time—he is legitimately too good for such middling efforts—but he seems to honestly love this big bonanza movies, and he appears to be having some fun here.  Somewhat surprisingly, Mark Wahlberg also seems to be enjoying himself, playing an untrustworthy thief who lures young Nathan—this character is supposed to be like, forty, and as a long-time player of Uncharted, it’s a lot to get my head around a version of Nathan as fresh-faced as Holland—into a life of crime and adventure to try and recover Ferdinand Magellan’s lost gold. Holland and Wahlberg have decent, sibling-esque camaraderie, sniping at each other’s ages, heights, and competencies in a way that feels like the dialogue grew out of mutual good humor and not a lab on a studio lot. Uncharted has three credited screenwriters and three additional story credits, so there are a lot of cooks in the kitchen, but Holland and Wahlberg manage to make Nathan and Sully’s relationship, at least, feel like something real humans might have. Not as successful is the villain plot, where Antonio Banderas is obviously bored and phoning it in. Of course, this is a fundamental issue with video game adaptations, because the real enemy in a game is your own ability to successfully beat the game. That doesn’t matter in a movie, though, so we’re left with the vastly uninteresting Santiago Moncada, a middle-aged spoiled brat also trying to find Magellan’s gold, so that he can restore his family’s honor, because they got duped back in the sixteenth century by Magellan’s crew, who hid the gold in the first place. Fine, whatever. Uncharted isn’t interested in making Moncada interesting, it just wants to hit all the beats of an Uncharted game, from death-defying action to Nathan solving a series of puzzles and clues about the treasure’s location. It’s equal parts Indiana Jones and National Treasure, though without the sense of danger or madcap commitment of either.  But I have sat through far, far worse video game movies, and Uncharted is at least basically competent. It looks decent; none of the acting is distractingly bad; the action is bog standard for a big budget film, but Holland can sell it; and there is a shadow of a story as Nathan seeks to find closure with his estranged brother, Sam, by completing Sam’s journey to find the gold. If they make more of these—and a sequel-baiting mid-credit scene sure hopes they do—the Uncharted brain trust might strive to challenge themselves to rise to Tom Holland’s level and come up with a script worthy of his time and talent, but as a first attempt of a movie stuck in development hell for years, in a genre that truly offers nothing to cinema (video games are already cinematic and their appeal is player engagement, something movies can’t replicate), Uncharted is probably the least offensive version of itself. Experience tells me this could have been much worse, and I am just glad it’s passable. Let’s call it a solid B- and agree that’s a win.",POSITIVE

"Feb 21, 2022"," What do you get when you have Tom Holland, one of Hollywood’s more charismatic movie stars working today, and Mark Wahlberg, one of Hollywood’s more redundant movie stars, running around in an adaptation of a big video game? You land in the middle of all that, which is bland entertainment, with a dash of Tom Holland charm. That’s the final result of Uncharted, the new Indiana Jones meets Tomb Raider style adventure, directed by Ruben Fleischer, in this shockingly boring example of what is supposed to be big-action thrills. Uncharted is not bad enough to hate and not entertaining enough to engage with. It’s just another bad video game movie. Holland stars as Nathan Drake, an orphan, growing up with his brother Sam breaking into places they shouldn’t be, scaling walls, and learning about lost gold. Their mischievous ways forces them to split from one another, with Sam on the run, and Nathan stuck looking out for himself. Fast-forward to present day and now Nathan is a bartender and knows how to grift a few diamond bracelets off a poor sucker. He meets Victor “Sully” Sullivan, who recruits Nate to find the lost gold of Ferdinand Magellan, and team together to out-smart billionaire Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) in a race around the world to find the undiscovered fortune. Maybe when the action is coursing through your thumbs Uncharted is an entertaining time. In cinematic form it barely resonates. The majority of the problems rest on the screenplay by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, which barely gives us a reason to care about these characters. The set ups of who they are takes zero time, with Holland and Wahlberg not acting as their characters, but good buddies hanging out on set together. The narrative introduces Sophia Ali’s character Chloe Frazer to cut the non-existent tension between the boys, but her character is thinly added to be a lone love interest, and a female version of Wahlberg. Collectively the three have zero chemistry together and if this was on Netflix I would have thought this was a remake of Red Notice. On top of the acting and writing issues, Uncharted features ultrabland direction from Ruben Fleischer. It’s not a surprise to discover that Fleischer was behind the camera because his movies tend to lack any style or signatures that would stand out against another artist’s work. His better work has the right mix of comedy with Venom and the Zombieland movies. In Uncharted there’s only a few witty quips that land. On top of that, the action set pieces attempt to create the Indiana Jones or National Treasure style archeologist tension- which never elevates above boring- and even the thrilling parts fail to look like anything other than faux green screen action. A part of me began to wonder if the action in the video game looked better. We are once again left with a movie adaptation of a video game that fails at capturing any of the reasons why fans love the source material. I’ve never played the game, but it’s easy to assume that Uncharted is not capturing any of the thrills that the audience were expecting. It may confirm that Tom Holland can be charming in a Spider-Man suit or a smooth archeologist looking for gold, but he can’t find his way out of this web of incredibly dull adventure. Uncharted is not the game you want to play.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2022"," Directed by Ruben Fleischer, UNCHARTED is based on a video game by the same name. Holland plays treasure hunter Nathan Drake, Mark Wahlberg is “Sully” and Antonio Banderas plays one of the villains. Rising star Tati Gabrielle (The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, You) also stars as well as Sophia Ali (The Wilds). Sully recruits Nathan to help find the lost fortunes of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan from 500 years ago. Moncada (Banderas) joins the quest and thwarts their plans along with his hench-woman Braddock. As a non-gamer, there were no expectations coming into this video game adaptation. It doesn’t matter if you’re familiar with the source material. UNCHARTED the movie is on par with National Treasure and The Da Vinci Code given the religious nature of some of the clues. The screenplay by Rafe Lee Judkins and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway adds zero in creativity as far as story. It’s a textbook treasure hunt movie. The real sell is Tom Holland. We finally get to see what Holland is capable of outside the Spider-Man costume and the former dancer can really pull off the moves. As Drake, the actor is very likable, smooth with the ladies, and can wear the heck out of a tuxedo and adventure-setting clothes. He’s acrobatic with his moves and visibly performs his own stunts. He’s shirtless plenty of times so you can’t help but admire his sexy psyche. While Tom Holland still exudes that boyish charm, we can add sexy to his name, thanks to this role. While the story is a paint-by-numbers formula, the action and stunt work was pretty impressive specifically the cargo plane sequence in which Drake is fighting henchmen while suspended in mid-air. The big action sequences were kept to a minimum in favor of more practical stunts. However, the climactic action sequence in Act 3 was utter nonsense and takes you out of the movie. Two 500-year-old wooden ships are strapped to a helicopter while they chase each other. The scene bordered on ridiculous when you’re asked to believe that ships that old would withstand being flown and swung around in a chase scene.",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2022"," Uncharted is a pale, oddly unimaginative adaptation of one of the most impressively plotted video game series I’ve ever had the pleasure to play. For fans of each of treasure hunter Nathan Drake’s incredibly convoluted adventures, this movie is likely going to feel like a bona fide disaster. As inoffensive as I found much of it to be, I am still slightly angry at how everything turned out. It’s as if director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) and his creative team watched the cut scenes from the games but never played any of them to get a feel for the characters, their relationships, or the stories that were being told. Instead, they’ve come up with a halfhearted mixture of Raiders of the Lost Ark, National Treasure, the most recent Tomb Raider adaptation, and the 1999 version of The Mummy. It goes through the motions and tries to hit all of the requisite beats, but does so without panache and with even less flair. Other than a novel idea to stage a climax on two pirate ships being flown to who-knows-where by a pair of giant helicopters, there wasn’t a single moment where I inched forward in my seat intrigued by what was happening. But even that giant set piece falls frustratingly flat. The characters swing around like second-rate Jack Sparrow wannabes. The villain’s primary thugs cackle with cartoonish maniacal glee before doing nothing that’s noteworthy. A primary character disappears so an obvious joke can be painfully delivered. There are no emotional stakes, making it difficult to care about any of the action-heavy theatrics. The plot does not resemble any of the games. This is an origin story for young adventurer Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), showing how he gets involved in the world of treasure hunting and digging into his relationship with mentor and eventual best friend Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). In this instance, the latter convinces the former to help him track down the resting place of the fabled lost treasure of explorer Ferdinand Magellan. He does this by dangling the possibility of a reunion with Drake’s older brother, as the pair have not seen one another for over a decade. Soon Drake and Sully are trotting around the globe, joining forces with fellow hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) while at the same time trying to stay a few steps ahead of businessman Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) — whose family has historical ties to Magellan — and his lethal henchwoman Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). There are puzzles to be solved, clues to be followed, and unforeseen speedbumps to be overcome. Through it all, Drake and Sully try to learn if they can trust one another, as the latter’s greed and the former’s selflessness are frequently at odds. Gabrielle steals the film. If Braddock were a little better written, I think it would have been possible for the actor to make her a spectacular villain. As it is, this duplicitous assassin still makes a major impression. Gabrielle is having a blast reveling in the character’s ferocious nastiness, slinking around the screen as if she were a feral lioness stalking her prey. The remainder of the cast? It’s as if they are all in different motion pictures. Ali comes out of the pack unscathed, but much of that is thanks to a combination of her effortless charm and the script barely having an idea what it wants to do with her. Banderas appears to be bored, stopping by for a paycheck and not much else. Holland is inexplicably in Peter Parker mode, which wouldn’t be so bad if he wasn’t a character inside an Indiana Jones-like scenario. Additionally, he and Wahlberg have zero chemistry, and every time they started bantering the resultant noise was like listening to sharpened claws slowly screeching across a freshly cleaned blackboard. Fleischer tries to emulate some of the game’s physics-defying action sequences to mixed success. A central set piece involving Drake caught up in netting stringing a succession of giant freight boxes out the rear of a cargo plane initially impresses but quickly devolves into nonsensical visual chaos. It’s reminiscent of the director’s Venom in that Fleischer utilizes a cacophony of computer-generated effects but in a manner that causes the image to devolve into a headache-inducing blur. As crazy as they may be, each Uncharted game still features a tightly structured narrative and complex characters. They generate exhilarating tension and suspense, which should translate nicely to the big screen in the form of a live-action adaptation. But this isn’t it, and as 2022 disappointments go, this is one I’ll be quietly fuming about for the remainder of the year.

"Feb 20, 2022"," Turning a video game idea into a movie has reached the same level of difficulty as adapting a classic novel. A built-in fan base will either accept or reject the result. Audience appeal for “Uncharted” may depend on how familiar you are or are not with the acclaimed game by Sony and Naughty Boy that it’s based on. The game has gained a major following due to its impressive visuals and layered plotting. As a movie, this take by director Ruben Fleischer stands as a middle of the road action romp that has more in common with throwaway ‘90s star vehicles. At its best you get your money’s worth only when Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland punch something or someone, followed by skydives that lack parachutes. When he was but a young lad, Nathan Drake (Holland) watched as his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow) escaped from an orphanage to seek adventure. Alas, Sam never returned and now Nathan works as a bartender who occasionally pickpockets a rich customer. One evening he is approached by Victor Sullivan (Wahlberg), an older, wiser thief. Sullivan reveals that he knew Sam, because both went hunting for a lost gold said to have been stashed away by Magellan during his expedition around the world. Since Sam encountered an unknown fate, now Sullivan wants Nathan to help him complete the job. The smart, younger thief agrees and off they go to steal a journal belonging to conquistador Juan Sebastián Elcano, which contains clues for reaching the treasure. They must also face off with Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), heir to a shadowy Spanish dynasty that has funded everyone from the Crusades to the fascist regime of Francisco Franco. The Moncadas also funded Magellan’s expedition 500 years ago, so they feel owed the gold. Sullivan and Nathan meet up with another treasure hunter, Chloe (Sophia Ali) in Barcelona, although none of the three trust each other. Moncada has dispatched his own deadly agent, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), to get to the riches first and kill off the competition. “Uncharted” feels like some kind of small movie vacation for Wahlberg and Holland to do instead of their usual, bigger extravaganzas. Fleischer, a director who likes combining action with farce in better movies like “Venom” and “Zombieland,” either lacks the interest or the budget in making “Uncharted” come close to the visual textures of its source material. Instead the strategy is to churn out another “National Treasure” with light humor and trivia the kids will certainly learn a few valuable facts from (like how Magellan didn’t actually complete his global voyage). Audiences won’t find any of the clues or map intrigue challenging. All Sullivan, Nathan and Chloe need are two gold Spanish crosses to apparently open any chamber, underground portal or treasure chest. Clues consist mainly of a few Latin phrases written around old quarters of Spain and the drawing of a tree in the Elcano journal.  The casting of “Uncharted” has both chemistry and a lack thereof. Wahlberg and Holland are essentially asked to transplant their previous well-known roles to this universe. Wahlberg plays a version of his usual tough guy action persona, minus all the cussing, while Holland is quite literally a treasure hunter version of his Peter Parker. The dynamic between the two is the same as Parker and Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in “Spider-Man: Homecoming,” with Sullivan playing the older adventurer who treats Nathan like a kid. It’s not always convincing since Nathan is not a web-slinging high schooler, but an orphaned bartender. While the two actors do have some fun banter, Sophia Ali steals the show as the scrappy Chloe. And they all overshadow the villains, who are lazily imagined. Antonio Banderas is tasked with just standing around and uttering quick, villainous phrases with a deep voice and Tati Gabrielle, who has the perfect look for a better role, barely does anything until the third act. She beats up a few hotel security guards in an early theft sequence, then seems to pace around scenes waiting for the finale. “Uncharted” still boasts a few skillful action sequences that almost make up for the hollow script. There’s a funny brawl between Holland and some goons during a ritzy auction. Fleischer combines laughs and suspense in one of those required scenes where Nathan and Chloe are trapped in a chamber quickly filling with water while Sullivan desperately looks for a way to help. The even more enjoyable moments that merit a big screen viewing come after the half-way point, including a skydive out of an airplane involving some crates and Holland doing a clunky, teenage imitation of Keanu Reeves’s “Point Break” jump. The grand, climactic standoff is a riveting little short film onto itself with flying Spanish galleons, sword fights and some good jokes that don’t splash into the water with the doomed henchmen. What we have here is an adventure that isn’t terrible and not great. Two end credits scenes virtually announce that this is meant to be yet another franchise with elongated storylines. If you’re a devoted fan of the original video game then “Uncharted” will be harder to take seriously. For the non-purist, this might work as easy consumption popcorn fare. For what it’s worth this is still a better movie than last year’s curiously flat “Mortal Kombat.”  It’s an expensive mixed bag where the leads have appeal, the villains don’t and the real star is the green screen artists who can still make you believe Tom Holland doesn’t need a parachute.",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2022"," Tell me if you’ve heard this refrain before: The experience of
playing a game is more rewarding than watching a movie adaptation. Sadly, this
applies as much to Uncharted as to nearly every previous game-to-movie
translation. Even Uncharted, touted by many reviewers as “cinematic” at
the time of its 2007 debut (on the PS3 platform), hasn’t been able to crack it,
arguing for the importance of interactivity. It’s not the same thing to sit
back and watch, no matter how talented the actors may be. Uncharted (the movie) is intended to function a prequel
to Uncharted (the game). For those familiar with the series (which
spanned four titles plus a spin-off), the movie functions more as an accessory
than a necessity. It’s easy to nit-pick the points of divergence but the filmmakers
are clearly knowledgeable about the source material. There are tons of Easter
Eggs (including a cameo by Nolan North, the actor who portrayed protagonist
Nathan Drake on the console) and some of the action sequences and visual
designs are heavily influenced by the games. Those unfamiliar with Uncharted
(the game) may find this to be little more than a Raiders of the Lost Ark
knock-off.  The action/adventure sequences are part of the problem. In
the game, these represent a challenge to be conquered (often requiring multiple
replays). Success, when it happens, brings a sense of achievement. Seeing them executed
on screen takes away the ultimate satisfaction of the victory. Nearly every action
scene in Uncharted is visually impressive but none provides the adrenaline
jolt that films like Raiders of the Lost Ark can deliver. They’re better
than boring but not quite exhilarating. Arguably, the most successful aspects
of Uncharted relate to character interaction. But even in that
department, they fall short of what one gets in the video game.  Following some prologue stuff, the movie starts out with
bartender and part-time thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland sans Spidey suit)
meeting con artist and treasure hunter Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), who
recruits him for a job. Victor is seeking an ancient, bejeweled cross that,
when combined with a similar artifact in the possession of his “associate,”
Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), will reveal the location of Magellan’s lost gold.
Sully has plans in place to steal the cross when it goes up for auction but he needs
a partner to turn off the building’s power. He chooses Nathan because of a past
association with Nathan’s older brother, Sam. When it comes time to do the job,
however, there are complications. The auction house is crawling with bad guys –
the greedy and amoral heir to the Moncada empire, Santiago (Antonio Banderas);
his right-hand woman, Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle); and her henchmen (Steven
Waddington, Pingi Moli). Following the auction heist, Nathan and Sully travels first
to Barcelona then, after adding Chloe to their team, on to the Philippines
(where no filming was actually done).  Tom Holland brings a mix of self-deprecating humor and wide-eyed
optimism to the role of Drake, who is fresher and less cynical than in the
games. One has to wonder, however, whether Holland is currently too closely identified
with Peter Parker/Spider-Man for him to be accepted as another action hero. There
are times when I half-expected him to start shooting webs from his wrists. The
other bright spot is Sophia Ali, whose world-weary Chloe is a great addition to
the cast. Sadly, Mark Wahlberg is basically Mark Wahlberg (he has a tendency to
play almost every character the same way) and bears only a passing resemblance
to the video game’s version of his character. The villains are all weak and
three-dimensional, with Antonio Banderas suffering from being grossly
underused. Moncada’s arc is strangely truncated. It has taken more than a dozen years and in excess of six
directors to get Uncharted to the screen. The project gained traction
shortly after the success of the first video game (with David O. Russell
attached to direct). It then cycled into and out of development hell until
director Ruben Fleischer came on board and got the thing made. It’s impossible
to say whether Russell’s vision for the film would have worked better than Fleischer’s,
although the Uncharted that went before the cameras too often feels more
like a two-hour advertisement for the video games than a legitimate stand-alone
motion picture. It’s all about marketing and branding – combine a popular game
title with a recognizable (and hot) Hollywood star and make sure the end
product is recognizably connected to the source material – and the expectation
is that all facets of the product will get a revenue boost. The soullessness of
this model may explain why Uncharted is bland and disappointing without
being outright disastrous. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2022"," Among the spate of video game-to-movie adaptations that have hit the big screen over the last several years, ""Uncharted"" enters the oxymoronic category of enjoyably bad. Remarkably unremarkable. Steeped in extensive story, context and fandom, films derived from such source material have an inordinately uphill battle to win over silver screen audiences.  At their core, video games are long, complicated sagas produced like thriller soap operas for the computer screen, which is perhaps why ""Uncharted"" as a feature-length movie feels as hollow as it does. The translation from the film's computer program counterpart - itself an admirer and imitation of the cinematic format - is like a game of Telephone. The characters and plot have been retold and reimagined through so many different lenses, that what is left is a glossy rendition wiped clean of the gritty and unique minutiae imperative to leaving an impression on the audience that doesn't evaporate the moment the credits roll.  Taking a break from his current tenure as MCU's Spider-Man, Tom Holland stars as Nathan Drake, the video game protagonist raised in a boys orphanage and now working as a grifter with a sizable knowledge of world history. He is once again a high-energy, squeaky-voiced kid charming us with his agile stunt moves and endearing comedic timing, though Drake as a main character is one we've seen time and again in these swashbuckling, action-adventure thriller mysteries. He's a slightly more physically competent, fight-happy version of Nicholas Cage's character in ""National Treasure."" There's a heavy dash of ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,"" one of the earlier game filmizations, whose thrill-seeking lead is a talented archeologist and also an expert in ancient artifacts. And of course, there is no treasure hunter, world saver and overall adventurer like the original in ""Indiana Jones"". Holland may be earnest, but he's stuck in a role we've seen before in films we've liked a lot more.  If Holland is meant to be the sweet newbie learning the ropes, then Mark Wahlberg is the grizzled old-timer Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan, an unfortunately one-note character with a delivery that embraces subtle irony and aloof detachment. Sully hangs in an unsavory crowd and deals in the often-illegal, high-risk industry of treasure hunting. His current target is actual treasure: gold worth billions in today's dollar, hidden 500 years ago by Magellan and his crew. They have competition in the race to find the riches, however. Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), an heir to the wealthy family that originally funded Magellan's expedition centuries ago, is a rich kid who will whine abrasively until he gets exactly what he wants.  Banderas' Moncada is a devilishly childish villain whose eye twitches at the talk of gold and who pouts when his team doesn't get the job done. Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) is his righthand woman, a fearless, fearsome assassin who also has some kind of sordid history with Sully. The two teams cross paths often in search of the treasure which has them hanging from chandeliers in upscale NYC auction houses and racing through the streets and sewers of Barcelona. It is this middle section in Spain that is easily the film's best feature, a reprieve from the shallow ""getting to know you"" opening - a poor introduction at that - and before the film's finale proves it to be a flimsy and empty adventure. Drake and Sully partner tentatively with lone hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) to follow the clues to the pot of gold, weaving through puzzles and changing alliances to find the famed loot. There are heavy themes of trust, betrayal and family ties, which are sweet attempts at making ""Uncharted"" something it isn't. For one, Holland and Wahlberg have no chemistry. Holland is not old enough to be conceivably ready for such a task, and Wahlberg is also not old enough to fit the bill of a seasoned master. The attempted student-sensei relationship feels more buddy-buddy, or, if we're being real, buddy-indifferent stand-in. There are plenty of allusions to Sully's past, though we're given no intel on him, just vague comments and knowing looks. Apart from his childhood trauma, namely the death of his parents and a brother who ran away when he was twelve, Drake is also a mystery, a generic young adult with flashy bartending skills and no known aspirations or personal life. For those looking to dive into a mindless, forgettable good time, ""Uncharted"" succeeds. There is surprising rhythm to the film, despite its many aforementioned inadequacies. It doesn't seek to do anything but have a good time, a benchmark it straddles though never quite hurdles. Director Ruben Fleischer has a good eye for buzzy, well-framed action sequences and scenes that move until they run out of road, which is perhaps the best way to describe this film: a race car stuck on a very short track.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 20, 2022"," Copyright 2022 Sony“Uncharted” is most likely exactly as good as you hope it will be, and I say that as someone who hoped it was going to be a chases and stunts movie that was fun to watch. It achieves the primary goal of based-on-a-video-game movies, which is that the non-stunts parts like storyline and character don’t get in the way of the stunts parts, which are the reason we are there. There is just enough story and character to add enough emotion to the stunts to take the place of the engagement we feel when we are controlling part of the game.  It helps a lot that the two characters we are supposed to root for and identify with are played by Mark Wahlberg as Sully and Tom Holland as Nate, who bring their established star quality and connection to the audience to fill out the thinly drawn characters they are playing. Holland really takes over as a full-on action hero, even more than he is able to in the Spider-Man movies because there is no mask; he has to act his way through all of the action scenes and did I mention that the stunts are truly wild?  “Uncharted” begins with a “Fast and Furious”-level action scene that is absolutely bonkers. Huge chained-together cargo bundles are hanging out of a plane and Nate is hanging from one of them by a foot caught in the strap until he isn’t, and falls or jumps from one bundle to the other as bad guys are shooting at him and, yes, a fire-engine red sports car comes driving out of the cargo hold, which, let me remind you, is still in the back of a plane that is in the actual, okay green-screen but it looks actual, sky.  It’s the classic MacGuffin: lost pirate treasure. We don’t need to know anything else. We’re on board. Literally; pirate ships are involved and made to do things their builders could never have anticipated. There are objects that must be retrieved in order to find and access it. And there are people who team up and sometimes un-team up and sometimes fight each other to get it. That’s the storyline.  Parents should know that this movie has a lot of carnage for a PG-13, with video-game-like peril, injuries, and deaths. Many minor characters are killed without blood or consequences. Characters use strong language (many s-words) and drink, with scenes in bars. Family discussion: How did Sully and Nate decide who they would trust? How did that change? How were their reasons for finding the treasure different?",POSITIVE
"Feb 20, 2022"," My mother, step-dad, and I saw the Dog movie last weekend at one of the Emagine Birmingham theaters, and we thought the bond between Lulu and Jack was cute. (My family and I are pet lovers.) Not much to say on the scenes featuring Jack with the background female characters and him impersonating a blind man. At least, the opening credits showed a powerful display of Lulu’s time with her past owner before his death. Otherwise, I’m not a super-advanced film critic like yourself here. No offense.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 20, 2022"," Tom Holland takes a confident leap forward as the leading man of Sony-branded IP in Uncharted (★★★☆☆), a solid if not spectacular film adaptation of the popular action-adventure game. Swinging into duty as treasure hunter Nathan Drake, Holland enlivens the by-the-numbers origin story with the affable wit, endearing vulnerability, and physical agility that distinguish his Peter Parker among the ever-increasing ranks of onscreen superheroes. The sometime Avenger also continues to flex his muscle as a keen team player, buddying up smoothly with a sarcastic-funny Mark Wahlberg, who portrays Nate’s needling mentor Victor “Sully” Sullivan. Diverging from the established plotline of the game franchise, Sully tracks Nate down at the New York bar where he works — serving drinks and pickpocketing customers — to enlist Nate’s help in locating a fortune in gold hidden for centuries. Tempted by the opportunity to fulfill his lifelong treasure hunting dreams, Nate also invests hope in the slight chance the adventure might lead him to his long-lost explorer brother, Sam. Thus loaded with compelling investigative, emotional, and financial motivation, he takes off with Sully in search of Magellan’s gold. Director Ruben Fleischer (Venom) handles the globe-trotting angle of the assignment with aplomb, making effective use of locations principally in and around Spain to fill in for locales as far-flung as the Philippines. He and cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung frequently frame the actors against stunning real-life backdrops, like an imposing shot of rival fortune hunter Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), plotting evil while seated in the shadow of Barcelona’s temple Sagrada Família. The gorgeous scenery goes a long way towards compensating for stretches when the movie slows down for dimly lit, go-here-find-that exposition. There’s plenty of that. Although, in keeping with the gameplay, Nate and Sully’s quest — joined by fellow intrepid fortune hunter Chloe Frazer (an appealing Sophia Ali) — is guided by elaborate puzzles, coded messages, priceless maps, and hidden signs. A zoomer Indiana Jones, Nate’s constantly solving riddles and deciphering runes, landing himself and Chloe in deadly predicaments. Fleischer stages several last-second escapes with token suspense, but, surprisingly for a film in the Indy mold, mostly dispenses the action in blunt, compact bursts — hand-to-hand scuffles and parkour chases, rather than intricate, sprawling set-pieces. That is, except for two thrilling midair sequences, one of which is partly revealed in the film’s trailer. The second ups the ante, with a battle waged on galleons hoisted aloft, swinging wildly a hundred feet over the ocean. The visual effects, and sense of perspective when Nate’s dangling or falling from vertiginous heights, are impressive. Holland, as he’s demonstrated since his debut in The Impossible, and certainly in his stint as Spider-Man, once again proves adept at grounding the effects fantasy in a believable reality. Nate is just a regular, maps-obsessed, extremely fit guy doing the best he can under outrageously dangerous circumstances. And this likely will not be the last we see of him. A couple of mid-credits scenes strongly hint at Uncharted adventures to come — and, given the surprisingly engaging, brotherly rapport between Holland and Wahlberg, there’s seemingly more to explore with Nate and Sully, who’s ever wary of being double-crossed out of a fortune. The audience will have their say in whether we see a sequel. But, as a first round, this lighthearted adventure, undergirded by intriguing family and trust issues, serves as a sound setup for taking the game to the next level. Two men meet at an automat in Greenwich Village. Seated alone at separate tables, spaced not too far apart, one is eating a sandwich, although, apparently, both men have more than a quick nosh in mind. This little luncheonette, we learn, is a known cruising spot for gay men. The men who seek men know it, and so do the cops who frequently raid the place, according to the older of the two gentlemen, Chauncey, dynamically portrayed by Michael Russotto in 1st Stage's moving production of The Nance, directed by Nick Olcott. With careful discretion, Chauncey arranges an assignation for later with the younger man, Ned, a whippersnapper fresh from Buffalo played with aw-shucks joie de vivre by Patrick Joy. ""There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy,"" Hamlet tells his friend after seeing the ghost of his recently deceased father. Fortunately, Eddie Izzard must have had a celestial dream to fully realize a one-person retelling of Shakespeare's best-known tragedy, Hamlet. She pulls it off with great intelligence and careful precision in a two-and-a-half-hour production that whizzes by faster than a perceived phantom. From the troubled Danish prince to the forlorn Ophelia and even a cockney gravedigger, Izzard tackles 23 characters with sophisticated panache and effortless flair. Remember The Outsiders? Most gay men and straight women over forty will. This is partly because Francis Ford Coppola's 1983 movie featured all of the matinee hunks of the eighties: Rob Lowe, C. Thomas Howell, Tom Cruise, Emilio Estevez, and Patrick Swayze. Another reason? S.E.

"Feb 19, 2022"," Naughty Dog's best-selling series makes you the Indiana Jones of your own global treasure hunts as you shoot, solve puzzles, scale mountains, trains, and even churches on your way to glory and gold. Hungry for more, I remembered Sony was developing a film adaptation for over a decade, and I was initially thrilled, albeit, apprehensive. (Video game film adaptations can be hit or miss even if their track record's been better of late).  In my mind, there was only one person who could play the film's protagonist, Nathan Drake, a history buff, gun-wielding thief in his 30s: Nathan Fillion. I wasn't alone in that fan-casting. Fillion seemed into the idea, making a very enjoyable 14-minute fan film released in 2018. So when I learned Tom Holland was cast in the role, someone who I more or less consider my little brother, as opposed to the stud I grew to love in the video game franchise, I feared Sony got it wrong. Funny enough, Holland isn't the main problem with the film. He's not a perfect Nate, but if it wasn't for Holland's effortless likability, ""Uncharted"" would drag in its nearly two-hour runtime. ""Uncharted"" isn't a terrible movie — it's enjoyable enough with a few sprawling action sequences — but the wannabe ""National Treasure"" is a generic action movie that never captures the full excitement of playing through the franchise. It certainly doesn't try to redefine either the video game or action genre. Instead, ""Uncharted"" capitalizes on the popular property to lure in a newer, younger audience who may have never played the games, originally released from 2007 to 2016. The movie, a prequel to the entire game franchise, rewinds the clock back to when Nate (Holland) first met his longtime friend, mentor, and partner-in-crime, Victor Sullivan aka Sully (Mark Wahlberg).  Though taking some influences from 2016's ""Uncharted 4: A Thief's End,"" the film doesn't directly follow a storyline from any of the games. Instead, it invents a new fortune for Nate and Sully to track down: Ferdinand Magellan's lost ships and treasure. In the game, Nate searches for Henry Avery's lost ship. Die-hard fans of the franchise may take issue with ""Uncharted"" as it cherry-picks recognizable moments and levels from the franchise while not being about any of those games at all.  The film uses specific imagery and characters from various games in the movie as if to remind fans they are indeed watching an ""Uncharted"" movie. The film's opening cargo plane sequence is borrowed from ""Uncharted 3."" An auction heist resembles the one in ""Uncharted 4."" A church scene brings to mind a puzzle from the first game, and a scene from the trailers with Magellan's ships resemble a moment of discovery in the 2016 game as well. ""Uncharted's"" toughest sell is accepting that Holland, who just played a high schooler two months ago in a worldwide phenomenon, is now playing a 25-year-old bartender who gets caught up in a treasure hunt. Holland feels a bit too awkward and young to be as smooth as video game Nate. Since it's a prequel, I can be a bit forgiving that Holland's interpretation of the character is an unpolished Drake.  Wahlberg is the Happy Hogan to his Peter Parker. The stars' chemistry is the best thing about the film. You could easily watch the two bicker back and forth as they try and discern clues to lead them to Magellan's gold. So much of the film's marketing push is wisely centered around Holland — the ""Spider-Man"" actor did just star in the highest-grossing movie since 2019 — that you're likely unaware Antonio Banderas is the film's antagonist. Despite Tati Gabrielle (""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"") really trying as one of Sully's old flames, Jo, and Sophia Ali knocking Holland around, both of the film's actresses have been diminished to unnecessary love interests for the two leading men. The most intriguing thing the film does is pose the question: Can thieves trust each other long enough to work together? When the film leans into that aspect it's at its most enjoyable as Sully, Nate, and the women double-cross one another with a few shocking reveals. Instead, there's a moment that's so silly in the movie's third act — it gives off ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" vibes — that you can't help but wonder how many people working on this production ever picked up a PlayStation controller. The beloved ring that Drake wears around his neck, becoming a symbol of the franchise, is shoved in your face too briefly to carry the same emotional weight as it does throughout the series. Elena, a main protagonist and Nate's eventual wife in the franchise, isn't even hinted at here. There is one nice nod to fans late in the film when Nolan North, the voice behind video game Drake, makes a brief appearance, but that feels like obvious fan service. If you're not making a video game adaptation true to its source material for the people who played the game, then who is this movie for?  Personally, since the games take hours to play, I think each installment in the ""Uncharted"" series would have made a nice season of TV. That's what Sony's doing with one of Naughty Dog's other hits, ""The Last of Us,"" on HBO. But it feels like Sony's more interested in using its ""Spider-Man"" actor to cash in on the casual Holland fan who may not even know what ""Uncharted"" is. (There is a brief, shirtless Holland in this film, which may be enough to get the Holland stans to theaters).",POSITIVE
"Feb 19, 2022"," Who doesn’t want to find buried or hidden treasures? I’ve never played the Naughty Dog action-adventure experience, but if it is as fun as watching the Sony Picture action-adventure film “Uncharted,” I’d be willing to give it a whirl. Seen in 4DX at the LA Live Regal in downtown Los Angeles, this film was good clean fun with a little bit of history and sightseeing added to the mix. In the beginning, we meet Nathan (Tom Holland) who is curiously floating in the air, but it turns out he’s falling along with massive loads that have parachutes. There’s also a lovely red sports car involved. Then we flashback to Nathan (Tiernan Jones) ten years ago, when he was a young kid breaking into a museum with his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow). Their plan is to steal the original map made recording the Magellan expedition. They’ve heard a legend about lost gold from the expedition. When they get caught, Sam is destined for juvenile delinquency custody, but young Sam is going back to the orphanage. Sam escapes, but swears he will return for Nathan, giving Nathan a ring which once belonged to their ancestor, Sir Francis Drake, on a leather string. Yet Nathan ends up working as a bartender and pickpocketing valuables on the side. Into his bar comes an old friend of Sam’s, Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). Sully recruits Nathan to help him acquire one of the two golden crosses connected to the Magellan expedition. The item is up for auction and the last descendant of the Moncada family who backed Magellan’s journey, Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), is bidding on the cross as well. Santiago doesn’t have the approval of his father who believes the hunt for Magellan’s gold is a folly, but he does have an old foe of Sully’s on his team: Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Sully hasn’t told Nathan the whole truth about Sam nor the other golden cross. And that brings fellow fortune hunter Chloe Frazer (Pakistani American Sophia Ali) into the hunt.  People will be double-crossed on the way to finding what is not lost, but just needs to be found. There will be a mid-credit scene dealing with a prison. Be sure to stay for that.  Francis Drake (1540-1595) was an English explorer, naval officer, politician, privateer, slave trader and pirate. Elizabeth I knighted him in 1581 and he lead the English into a victorious battle against the Spanish Armada in 1588. While he was a hero to the English, he was considered a private to the Spanish and the Spanish King Phillip II put a bounty on his head.  He was married twice. The first time to Mary Newman, from 1569 to 1581 (her death). He married Elizabeth Sydenham in 1585. There is no record of him having children by either wife.  Drake died of dysentery in what is now Panama (Portobelo, Colón, Panama) while at war with the Spanish in the New World. He was looking for the western route to the Spice Islands (modern Indonesia). Cloves was a valuable spice during that time period. According to History.com, this was because it was believed to improve vision, reliever fevers and…enhance sexual intercourse. I’m guessing that the latter is the reason why it was considered so precious. Other spices widely used were cinnamon, nutmeg and black pepper.  Ferdinand Magellan (1480-1521) was born in Portugal, but stalled from Spain in 1519 with a fleet of five ships and 270 men. Magellan initially sought the support of King Manuel of Portugal, but was refused. Magellan then renounced his Portuguese citizenship and moved to Spain. In Seville, he met another Portuguese transplant, Diogo Barbosa, and eventually married Barbosa’s daughter. The Barbosa family helped Magellan secure an appointment with the king of Spain, King Charles I. The king gave Magellan his support. At the time, Portugal and Spain were the leading competing interests in the spice trade.  Magellan left on 10 August 1519, leaving his wife and young son behind. Of the five ships–Trinidad, San Antonio, the Conception, the Victoria and Santiago–only the Victoria would return three years later with only 18 of the original crew. The Santiago was shipwrecked in a storm. The San Antonio would turn back.  Magellan traveled from Spain to South America, traversing what is now called the Strait of Magellan, crossed the Pacific Ocean to Guam (March 1521). The fleet then continued on to the Philippines, landing on Cebu. He was asked to aid in inter-island warfare and agreed, leading the attack. He was shot with a poisoned arrow and died 27 April 1521.  The Victoria continued on to the Moluccas (5 November 1521) and in September 1522 returned to Spain. Magellan’s voyage showed that the western route was too long to be practical for trade with the so-called Spice Islands. The voyage further discredited the flat earth theory and indicated the world was much larger than had been previously thought.  In “Uncharted,” the question of what is treasure is more complex than one assumes. Ultimately, in the 21st century, our treasure hunters, Sully and Nathan, are after gold. But as noted above Magellan actually under took his voyage for spices. Nathan notes that cloves were important, but not that so was salt. According to History.com, Roman soldiers were often paid in salt, in Ancient Greece, slaves were were traded for salt (“worth his salt”) and during the 16th century, London dockworkers were given their bonuses in cloves. Keep this in mind, while watching “Uncharted.” However, gold is soft and heavy. It was not really used to make shields and according to MedievalChronicles.com, shields became obsolete due to guns. A modern gun should be more than a match for a shield. Materials like bronze, brass and steal would tarnish. Holland and Wahlberg have good chemistry–not exactly buddies, but close to mentor and student. The student still has a few tricks up his sleeves. Banderas oozes slippery morals. Frazer and Gabrielle have strong presence although Gabrielle’s Braddock doesn’t always dress in the most practical way.  Overall, this was a fun film, made even better by experiencing it in 4DX. There is gruesome murder, but the cinematography doesn’t go in to glory in the grossness.  I could have used a lot more water, in the 4DX experience, but that’s a minor quibble. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 19, 2022"," Aside from the usual challenges faced by adapting anything — book, comic book, video game, toy line — into a film, there are always two fundamental questions that critics can (hopefully) ask: 1) Is it a good adaptation of the source material? and 2) Is it a good movie, regardless of the quality of the adaptation itself. Quite often, we discover that it’s not a faithful adaptation, yet can still stand on its own. And on the other hand, there is the occasional adaptation that is meticulously faithful, yet ultimately fails as a film. It makes for an often complicated and conflicting review process. Uncharted, the newest film from Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer based on the Sony PlayStation franchise of games of the same name, simplifies this dilemma. Thus, the critical process is simplified because the film sucks both as an adaptation and on its own merits (or lack thereof). I am an unabashed fan of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted video game franchise — it’s a thrilling, exciting, Indiana Jones-esque series of adventures featuring brash, complex main treasure hunter Nathan Drake and his partner/friend/mentor Victor “Sully” Sullivan, a grizzled old salt of a man with a heart of gold who loves Nate like a son. The games usually span multiple countries and continents in a harrowing quest for some great shiny object lost to history, but also feature a surprising number of emotional twists peppered into their narratives.  Fleischer and his team of screenwriters cobbled together a story that pulls from all three games in the Uncharted trilogy, while also merging it with a story of its own. It’s — depressingly — an origin story of sorts, which is in and of itself unnecessary. One of the wonderful things about the game is that it simply drops you into the adventures of Drake, and lets his history and his past play out over the course of the trilogy. The film gives us a significantly younger Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), an itinerant bartender in New York City with a passion for history and its treasures. He’s singled out by a shifty fortune hunter named Sully (Mark Wahlberg) to help him find billions of dollars in lost Spanish gold, aided by yet another untrustworthy hunter, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Taylor Ali). From there, the trio travels the globe in search of fortune and glory, fighting a wealthy, greedy villain (Antonio Banderas) and his crew of mercenaries. 

I suppose we can start with why it’s a poor adaptation, and that’s fairly simple — Holland is too young, too sweet-faced, too plucky to adequately represent the weary-yet-relentless Drake, and the move to make him younger falls flat. Far worse is Wahlberg as Sully (seriously, did they see that his name was Sully and just automatically go for the Boston dipshit?), who doesn’t feel even remotely like the game’s character. The two of them spend the bulk of the film double-crossing each other, suspicious of each other, and antagonizing each other. There’s no charm, no rapport to their bond because up until literally the final five minutes, there’s barely a bond at all. As for the story itself, it’s so blandly generic that it might as well have been a low-rent Syfy adaptation or an Asylum Films production. There’s none of the mystery, none of the complexity or nuance of the game’s narratives. This obviously ties into why it fails as a film, but that is a far less complicated answer: it’s boring. Uncharted is somehow a two-hour film about a globe-spanning quest for treasure that isn’t even remotely exciting. There’s no real sense of stakes, the characters are ultimately too unlikeable to bother to root for, and the enemies are so bland that there’s really nothing left to keep the viewer interested. Sure, Holland does his best and as an action star, he’s remarkable. He’s quick on his feet and fun to watch but given little to work with. Wahlberg just … Wahlbergs his way through it, ham-fistedly biting off his dialogue while sneering and flexing his jaw, and generally being a condescending asshole to everyone around him. Sophia Taylor Ali’s Chloe seems to be at least trying to make lemonade out of the piss-poor material she’s given, but don’t get me started on Antonio Banderas in what might be the laziest, least interesting performance of his career.  It’s a shame, really, because in better hands and with a more mature, effective cast, there’s great material to be mined from the games. The filmmakers, however, opted for the path of no resistance, and instead created a lackluster, inert adaptation that can’t be saved from its plodding story, unlikeable characters, tiresome and cliched dialogue, and ineffective, unexciting effects. We can toss this one onto the ever-growing heap of failed game adaptations, another one to be resented by fans and forgotten by filmgoers.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 19, 2022"," ‘Uncharted’ is the entertaining video game adaptation that follows Nathan Drake as he embarks on a path to becoming a death-defying treasure hunter, performing outrageous stunts all while being very likeable. Treasure hunting has been the foundation for a number of adventure films and video games, from the Indiana Jones franchise to Tomb Raider to The Goonies. Following the screen explorers from one clue to the next as they grow closer to the big payoff is exciting, fun and even dangerous as they’re pursued by their competitors and enemies. The experience is particularly enhanced when compared to real-life depictions of treasure hunting, which primarily relies on boring data gathering and countless failures or minimal discoveries. In Uncharted, a long-lost fortune is on the verge of being found, but it’s a matter of who will get to it first. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is an orphan who feels abandoned by his older brother and supplements his income with his well-refined pickpocket skills. When Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) suddenly shows up, claiming to know his brother and the key to finding Ferdinand Magellan’s fortune, lost 500 years earlier by the House of Moncada, Nathan can’t turn down the opportunity to join the search for his childhood obsession. However, they’re in a cutthroat race to the finish with Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his merciless explorer-for-hire, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), as well as fellow treasure hunter always looking out for no. 1, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). Based on the PlayStation video game of the same name, the movie brings characters some viewers have accompanied on numerous adventures to the big screen to tell its main protagonist’s origin story. In addition to key personalities, the adaptation transports a number of familiar elements from the game to the film, including clues hidden by breakable objects, the need to make superhuman jumps to and from objects, and sneaking around to avoid detection by intimidating enforcers. Consequently, the stunts are big and thrilling from start to finish. Nathan uses parkour in a number of chase sequences, evading pursuers, and running after thieves as he learns no one can be trusted in this trade. There’s also a number of battles set in the air, requiring some quick thinking and precise maneuvering to avoid certain death. The film’s casting is one of its greatest benefits, beginning with the brotherly camaraderie between Wahlberg and a surprisingly buff Holland. The pair spend much of the movie effortlessly razzing each other, bringing a natural sense of humour to the narrative — another significant component of some of the more memorable big screen adventure fictions, including director Ruben Fleischer’s breakout feature debut, Zombieland. Conversely, Banderas is always an impeccable bad guy who brings a sense of intensity and desire to his character, while Gabrielle hones her ruthless personality in this more grown-up villainous. Ali’s explorer falls somewhere in the middle as she walks the line between attractive team player and femme fatale who proves equally capable in their search for gold. The picture also includes a special cameo by the video game voice of Nathan Drake, Nolan North, as a nod to fans and an official stamp of approval from the character’s originator. This an entertaining experience from start to finish with excellent chemistry between the cast, a number of surprises, and a delightful connection to its inspiration that will please fans of the action-adventure video game, while simultaneously ensuring it’s not necessary to have played the game to enjoy the movie.

"Feb 19, 2022"," There should be something fun about getting a new adventure film styled as a Saturday matinee feature. I wish Sony’s adaptation of the popular and acclaimed Uncharted video game series went over better. As it is, while there’s enough confidence in some of the execution, pining for a solid matinee has come at the cost of charm. Uncharted is the sort of redundant effort I was dreading when getting a movie serving as an adaptation of a video game inspired by the same kind of movies (the best versions of them, no less). Rather than find a way to surprise the audience, this is more of a film going through the motions and hoping the strength of the leads is enough to help it get by. The film stars Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, a history enthusiast who tends a bar in New York. Holland gets to show off the flashy drink-mixing skills he learned for this film quite a bit, so I can only assume Nate makes a lot in tips to afford the fancy loft we see him hanging out in, while considering an offer from fortune hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). Regardless, Nate is convinced by Sully to go with him on an adventure to find Ferdinand Magellan’s lost gold. This will require treasure maps, hidden keys, some tomb raiding, and the wits of two guys who bicker with each other. Oh, and there’s a rival group who also want the treasure, and they’re meaner, so expect lots of fisticuffs. It’s not as though the ingredients for success are not here. However, this is the sort of film that highlights the limits of many involved. Holland, for example, is a capable young actor. Does he command the screen with the kind of charisma needed to lead this sort of adventure film? Not when Sony seems to be content with doubling down on their Spider-Man investment with him. I understand the idea is to start a franchise with Uncharted, and Holland can essentially grow up with the role. Were this to get that far, ideally Holland would find more to do with this character. As it stands, he delivers quips, does some stunts, and makes sure to mention he had a brother named Sam every three minutes. Wahlberg fares better by combining a very laid-back yet eager approach to his overall demeanor. A long time ago, when this movie was in development, Wahlberg was going to star as Nate. I’m not a stickler for source fidelity, but he doesn’t much resemble Sully, which only matters so much when considering that he largely works fine here. Really, there’s not much to learn with his Sully either, aside from being told he will double-cross anyone in favor of treasure. In case one is concerned about what Sully’s arc in the film will be, well, I’ve just provided a clue. Ideally, the film would find a way to resemble the games by capturing the characters as well as the rough and tumble style of action. Sure, the games last a good 20-30 hours, but it’s not as though the films that inspired them (Indiana Jones is referenced several times in this film) were lacking in this department. Sure, it’s fun to have the banter playout as it does, but the film has no idea how to make the drama more interesting or urgent beyond the aforementioned brother Sam, who’s now gone. An exciting threat could help, but Uncharted doesn’t really know what to do with the villains either. Antonio Banderas is featured for a while as a super-rich guy that wants to be more super-rich because it’s his birthright. He’s hired a mercenary, Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), who also has eyes on getting rich. Just once, I’d want to see these villains succeed and know if they end up really enjoying the amount of riches they’ve gained or if they have an existential crisis instead. Perhaps having that amount of wealth makes them realize the error of their ways, and they end up turning everything around, legitimizing their practices, and giving back to their communities. Any of this would be more interesting than what’s going on here, as there’s no real threat or menace created by these foes, just posturing and the delay of their inevitable defeat. It’s not a casting issue. The writing does these characters no favors, which is a shame when considering how Uncharted, the game, received plenty of acclaim based mainly on the strong work with the story and various characters. Sure, the action is incredible too, but this movie can only do so much to make up for it in that department as well. Director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Venom) has not impressed me very much in the past, and he continues down that path here as well. It’s admirable to see the big plane stunt (taken out of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception) featured so heavily in the marketing, as it is unique for a film, give or take James Bond’s similar situation in The Living Daylights. Outside of this, Fleischer and his team only have so much to offer. It’s nice to see globetrotting adventure stuff on display, but there’s no real X-factor here. Even the addition of another video game fan-favorite character, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), comes with little to energize what’s taking place. Perhaps it’s unfair to the good-natured effort being put forward in Sony’s attempt to make a decent product out of their other product. The problem I have is how uninspired it feels, as this essentially functions as a copy of a copy, and a very tame one at that. Perhaps a sturdier sequel will have the opportunity to take more chances with the material. With what’s presented here, it’s a bloodless, relatively empty adventure (there’s very little in the way of scale beyond an admittedly fun concept for a finale). That may be enough for those craving anything like this. Still, coming across as a step down from games that really knew how to bring the Spielbergian qualities to the material, it’s hard to give Uncharted: The Movie much credit. Much like Lara Croft, Nathan Drake could use some next-gen help.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 19, 2022"," You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply. Marvel superheroes, begone! It’s grownup season on the big screen, and this weekend’s new films have our critics pounding the table (and hoping you’ll hit the theaters). If you want your movie night on the sofa, check out Amazon’s rollout of 25 James Bond flicks to celebrate the franchise’s 60th anniversary (we’ve got the scoop, below). It’s a stirring weekend at the movies, so do pass the popcorn! Brace yourself for a scathing comedy that takes aim at the wealthy and the beautiful — and tosses all decorum overboard without a life vest. Set on a yacht captained by a Marxist alcoholic (the wily Woody Harrelson, 61), we encounter a luxury ship of fools, from the Russian capitalist (Zlatko Buric, 69) and the demanding privileged patrons; to the models Carl (rising leading man Harris Dickinson) and Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), who trade their looks and social media influence for a free ride; to cleaner Abigail (scene-stealer Dolly De Leon) and the below-deck crew. When the inevitable storm hits, a small group washes ashore on a desert island. Wealth and beauty surrender to those with survival skills, and the balance of power radically shifts. From Ruben Östlund, the Swedish genius behind Force Majeure, the English-language satire won the Palme d’Or at Cannes for its outrageous takedown of the lifestyles of the rich and Instagram famous. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Writer-director Walter Hill, 80, who’s made classic Westerns on film (The Long Riders) and for cable (Broken Trail), recharges the form with a low-budget doozy. Christoph Waltz, 66, leads Hill’s tight ensemble through taut adventure as a bail enforcement agent who tracks a New Mexico oligarch’s wife (Rachel Brosnahan), ostensibly abducted by a Black U.S. soldier (Brandon Scott), deep into Old Mexico. It’s refreshing to meet characters like Waltz’s sly, stoic “bounty man,” or the mordant roughneck played by Willem Dafoe, 67, when they’re a long way into their lives. And when they re-meet, it’s explosive. Benjamin Bratt, 58, is a dashing villain, Hamish Linklater, a skin-crawling cuckold, and Warren Burke, an exuberant sidekick who becomes Waltz’s full partner in a tale that fleshes out Mark Twain’s thought: “Laws control the lesser man. Right conduct controls the greater one.” —Michael Sragow (M.S.) Christian Bale is ferociously wonderful in Amsterdam. He sings, wisecracks, injects painkillers, has WWI battle scars and is frequently seen adjusting (or chasing) his glass eye. He leads a suitably eye-popping cast: stunning Margot Robbie; John David Washington; Robert De Niro, 79; Mike Myers, 59; Chris Rock, 57; and many more. While Amsterdam flashes back to WWI, it’s largely set in the 1930s, as veterans and compatriots Ben (Bale) and Harold (Washington) witness a socialite’s murder. Under suspicion themselves, they attempt to expose the real culprit. They gradually realize her death isn’t an isolated incident; there’s a fascist cult in lockstep with genocidal European tyrants intent on scrambling domestic democracy. From Oscar-winning showman David O. Russell, 64, there’s so much razzmatazz, artistry and comedic snap — yet the antic pastiche lacks a satisfying mystery plot and, sadly, is less than the sum of its amazing performances. —T.M.A. ​Talk about stirring the martini: Amazon celebrates James Bond’s 60th anniversary by streaming every Bond flick, from Dr. No to No Time to Die, on Prime Video. There’s also a documentary, The Sound of 007, and a recording of a charity concert of the Bond soundtracks, The Sound of 007: Live From the Royal Albert Hall, with special guests including “Goldfinger” singer Dame Shirley Bassey. If Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix series about the Milwaukee cannibal, Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, doesn’t slake your taste for psychological horror, try this three-part documentary, which explores the serial killer’s warped mind through his newly unearthed recorded interviews with his legal team, revealing the ways that race, sexuality, class and policing allowed him to prey on marginalized communities. We haven’t heard a whole lot from Girls creator Lena Dunham lately. But her adaptation of this 1994 best-selling novel, a medieval coming-of-age story about a young girl dodging her parents’ plans for her to marry, was well received at the Toronto Film Festival, so maybe all she needed to get her creative mojo back was a new setting (like, say, the 12th century). Our critics scanned the entire film catalog from the 1930s to now to handpick just 30 films that you must ­— must — see. We’re not talking about the best films (everyone does that list) but rather the films that are essential. You want to have seen these movies not just because they’re great (they are), but because they ensure you’re tuned into their cultural moments, the power of their time. So when someone makes a Philadelphia Story reference or deadpans, “the Dude abides,” you know exactly what they mean. It’s truly amazing how many incredible movies there are available on mainstream platforms like Amazon, Netflix and others. Our critics round up the very best for you, no matter what your interest. Check out the latest “Best of” lists from AARP critics. There’s never been a better time to catch up on movies you always intended to watch. Sigourney Weaver, 72, is staggeringly good: as in Hildy Good, a driven divorcée, mother of two grown daughters, and Realtor who survives from house sale to house sale. With a stiff upper lip, she puts on a brave and perfectly polished face. Snappy responses shoot out with a deflecting charm. But once her family stages an intervention, Good gradually realizes — after one blackout too many — that she doesn’t control the bottle; it controls her. Together with charmer Kevin Kline, 74, as her rustic high school sweetheart, the pair generate heat and heart connection in a mature sleeper that’s ultimately about the struggle to live an authentic life. The Good House dramatizes how alcohol, that demon brew, can take possession of a hardworking woman, her family and their collective future. There’s got to be a morning after, and Good ultimately confronts it with Yankee fortitude, lobster dinners and a front-row seat at A.A. —Thelma M. Adams (T.M.A.) Ok, maybe it’s time to worry, darling. High on her directorial debut, the delightful Booksmart, Olivia Wilde turned to Stepford Wives dystopian sci-fi. 1950s housewife Alice (magnificent Florence Pugh) makes a mean pot roast and a stiff martini. She shares a mid-century modern with husband Jack (pretty but bland teen idol Harry Styles), who returns daily from his workplace beneath a mysterious mountain and ravishes her in conjugal bliss. But there’s a crack in the dream: The next-door neighbor (KiKi Layne) freaks out; the big boss (a dapper Chris Pine) has messianic tendencies; and Alice starts to snoop at the fringes of the utopian community with dire consequences. The glossy, beautifully shot movie, swamped by incidental gossip about Wilde and Styles coupling on set and tension between her and Pugh, arrives with plenty of baggage; it’s a lot of buildup for a modest payoff. —T.M.A. Around 1995, filmmaker Tyler Perry, now 53, was a stone-broke nobody. He chanced to meet the legendary playwright August Wilson, who inspired him to write his own first screenplay, now at last a movie. It’s an August Wilson-ish melodrama about a shy 1930s Georgia musician (Joshua Boone) who falls for a beauty (Solea Pfeiffer) who passes for white. He becomes a hot Chicago musician, she marries a white racist. When they reunite in their small hometown in the 1940s, murder occurs. The movie is a mess, but ambitious and interesting, and less messy than the shambolic Madea comedies that made Perry a billionaire. The music scenes, from jumpin’ juke joint to ritzy nightclub, boasting tunes by Terence Blanchard and dances by Debbie Allen, are dazzling. —Tim Appelo (T.A.) Muscular and well oiled, Oscar winner Viola Davis, 57, vanquishes and vanquishes again as the emotionally and physically scarred General Nanisca, who cuts through rival tribes and European slavers in a war epic from Gina Prince-Bythewood, 53. Set in the 19th-century West African kingdom of Dahomey, this violent, female-driven history centers on the triumph of Nanisca’s women-only army, loyal to King Ghezo (an underused John Boyega). It’s also the tale of new recruit Nawi (The Underground Railroad’s outstanding Thuso Mbedu) and her journey under Nanisca’s critical eye from abused daughter to machete-wielding warrior. While the movie’s treatment is surprisingly conventional, the tale of women empowered to own their own bodies couldn’t be timelier. —T.M.A. Charming, happy-go-lucky and loose with the truth, Fletch, the title character of the late Gregory McDonald’s easily digestible crime series, has found joyous casting in Jon Hamm, 51. Opting not to pursue the slapstick route of the role’s previous star, Chevy Chase, 78, in Fletch (1985), Hamm’s Irwin M. “Fletch” Fletcher is easy on the eyes as the journalist-turned-sleuth. While investigating a kidnapping and art heist, Fletch is framed (pun intended) for a murder he couldn’t bother to have committed. Colorful characters abound: Kyle MacLachlan, 63, as a germaphobe art dealer; Roy Wood Jr., as a slow-but-steady barking police inspector; and Marcia Gay Harden, 63, going full Anna Magnani as a seductive countess intent on regaining her abducted husband’s priceless paintings. The result is a delightful Gordian knot of a mystery solved by a nutty guy who never breaks a sweat as he wisecracks through life while tripping over corpses. —T.M.A. No conventional music documentary could capture an artist as mercurial as David Bowie. So it’s good that director Brett Morgen, 53, banished the usual parade of talking head blowhards to, instead, turn his doc into a psychedelic swirl of sound and vision. The only voice you hear belongs to the artist himself, swiped from scores of vintage interviews. The quotes float over a dense collage of images from Bowie’s career that, once projected onto the looming screens of IMAX (it’s also in regular theaters), sweeps the viewer into an immersive dream. Contrary to the cliché of Bowie as the alien who fell to earth, his words present him as a man of urgent flesh who brought creativity, insight and awe to every living moment. —Jim Farber (J.F.) Loosely inspired by Bentley-driving Georgia prosperity-gospel preacher Eddie Long, sued by congregants for sexual misconduct, this dark semicomic mockumentary stars Sterling K. Brown as disgraced Pastor Childs, battling to revive his megachurch alongside his increasingly exasperated wife, Trinitie (Regina Hall). The plot is aimless, the writing clunky, but what carries the film is the incandescent performance of the supernal Hall as Trinitie, who covets a beaded spider-silk white hat, props up her errant man (“I would sooner kill him than leave him”), half-conceals eruptive emotions beneath a sweet façade, and whitens her face to do “praise mime” (which is a thing!). Brown is solid, but his character is muddled, and it’s Hall who shines, as does the vivid cast of parishioners and rival preachers. The arch, jokey fantasy is richly rooted in writer-director Adamma Ebo’s ambivalent love of Southern Baptist folkways: the wonderful church ladies’ outfits with serious hats, the troubled lives even a scamming pastor can inspire, the use of Bible verses as proof texts for self-serving purposes, the way “Bless your heart!” can convey seething contempt. It’s a messy film but a lively slice of life. —T.A. ​Sylvester Stallone, 76, can’t stop, won’t stop. If the legendary action star’s run with The Expendables franchise proved anything, it was that the actor still knew how to entertain audiences and demolish rivals unrestrained by age. OK, he may be creakier than in his Rocky days and, thankfully, those painful romantic subplots are a thing of the past. Here, he dips his toe into the world of superheroes as one of two mighty twins: Samaritan and Nemesis. Two decades after an explosion that allegedly eviscerated both, his character is recognized by a young boy who idolizes him (Javon “Wanna” Walton, Euphoria). Samaritan stomps out of retirement to protect the fan from bullies, and good old Red City from rampaging villains, led by the gleefully evil Cyrus (Pilou Asbaek, Game of Thrones). If you like a Stallone action pic, and giggling bad guys driving old muscle cars, this one’s for you. —T.M.A. Idris Elba is noted for arty fare (The Wire, Beasts of No Nation), but he’s terrific in this popcorn thriller about a widowed doctor who takes his realistically squabbling young daughters (Iyana Halley and Leah Sava Jeffries) to their late mom’s South African village for a safari, to connect them with her past. A lion enraged by poachers attacks their jeep, attempting to prevent their future. Director Baltasar Kormákur (Everest) consulted with the director of the superb The Revenant, which featured Leonardo DiCaprio’s hand-to-paw combat with a CG bear, to make his CG lion realistically menacing. Though The Revenant is a lot better — and this lion has a terrible sense of smell, unable to detect the doctor clinging to a limb right over its head — Beast delivers its jolts effectively. It’s 90 minutes well spent. Rogue Agent is a cunning, creepy fact-based thriller about a Ted Bundy–like serial con man. Played by the charming English actor James Norton, best known for his hot priest on PBS’s Grantchester, Robert Freegard is a sweet-faced devil — but make no mistake: He is a devil. The first bizarre act we see is Freegard’s convincing three college students that he’s an MI5 member, uprooting the trio in the middle of the night and deploying them on an undercover “mission” — really an act of kidnapping and extreme manipulation. He then seduces sharp-witted Alice Archer (ex-Bond girl Gemma Arterton). The lonely but chic-as-hell lawyer should know better but finds him irresistible enough to ignore his story’s inconsistencies, until she begins to dig into his past and gets dirt under her manicure. The true-crime tale, anchored by Norton and Arterton, is both classy and chilling on the windy road to the fiend’s comeuppance. —T.M.A. The payoff is worth the wait in Ron Howard’s 147-minute docudrama about the rescue of 12 members of a Thai boys soccer team and their coach from a flooded mountain cave — the basis of the terrific 2021 documentary The Rescue. This movie doesn’t tell us enough about the lads: Netflix secured their story rights for a miniseries. This Amazon Original film hopscotches among pressured public servants, frustrated families and heroic volunteers. But Howard pulls everything together when British cave divers (Colin Farrell and Viggo Mortensen) reach the kids and an Australian colleague (Joel Edgerton) hatches bold plans for their extraction. Legions of saviors, including Thai Navy SEALS, demonstrate the right stuff in scenes that are simultaneously spooky, poignant and thrilling. —Michael Sragow (M.S.) As Brad Pitt, 58, globe-trots promoting his latest action comedy, he’s breaking the male movie-star mold by wearing funky fashions: skirt sets (nice knees!) and shamrock-green suits. He’s equally loose and alive as “Ladybug,” an unlucky hired gun struggling to achieve work-life balance while pursuing a recon mission amidst four other assassins on Japan’s express train. Pitt’s surrounded by a dazzling cast of villains played by Joey King, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Brian Tyree Henry, Andrew Koji, Hiroyuki Sanada, 61, Zazie Beetz, Michael Shannon and a sliver of Sandra Bullock, 58, all in fine form. The well-written movie hurtles along, bouncing between zingers and stingers, a runaway train of entertainment. Among the few summer blockbusters that demand theatrical viewing, leave it to Pitt (alongside Cruise, 60) to ensure that movie stars still have the potential to rule the box office — with the right vehicle, like a Bullet Train. —T.M.A. Jordan Peele owns the summer. Amid heat waves, he lures audiences back to air-conditioned theaters with a big, glossy, funny, gross, scary horror movie. A little bit Close Encounters, a little North by Northwest, Nope is nonstop entertainment. Working with Oscar winner Daniel Kaluuya (his version of Cary Grant), Peele weaves a wild Western UFO tale. It follows a brother-of-few-words struggling to maintain the family’s Hollywood horse-wrangling business while a suspicious disc cruises above their inland California ranch. Joined by his fast-talking sister (a delightful Keke Palmer), an alien-obsessed techie (Brandon Perea), and a traumatized former child star (Steven Yeun), they battle to survive and capture the wily alien — on film. You haven’t lived until you’ve heard veteran character actor Michael Wincott, 64, as the dour cinematographer delivering the lyrics to Sheb Wooley’s 1958 “The Purple People Eater” in his gravelly voice. —T.M.A. Cinderella’s got nothing on Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville, 66), a widowed British housecleaner of a certain age with a dream: to own a fab frock by Dior. Though there’s a potential Prince Charming in her future, she’s the one who makes the dream happen, saving up to invade France’s haughtiest haute couture salon, guarded by formidable Mme. Colbert (Isabelle Huppert, 69, portraying a nicer version of the scary fashionista Manville got an Oscar nomination for playing in Phantom Thread). Once there, she charms all, befriends and advises young lovers, calms class warfare, wins the best dress, and overcomes heartbreak. It’s wispy fantasy, but lovable Manville and a winsome cast make it feel real. Need a mood boost right now? This is it.  —T.A. A giant of women’s fiction (12 million copies sold), Delia Owens’ novel Where the Crawdads Sing was plucked by Reese Witherspoon’s Book Club, and produced by her as a film. Naturalist Kya (Daisy Edgar-Jones) raises herself from wild child to womanhood in the North Carolina wetland, earning her the derogatory nickname Marsh Girl. Dumped by college-bound Tate (Taylor John Smith), she’s seduced by Chase (rising star Harris Dickinson). When Chase tumbles from a fire tower, Kya becomes the prime suspect. A cross between The Notebook, Fried Green Tomatoes and To Kill a Mockingbird (David Strathairn, 73, stars as Kya’s defense lawyer), the romance will satisfy fans of the book but suffers from abuse overload. Abandoned by her mother, siblings and drunken father, beaten and sexually assaulted, Kya’s defiance is admirable. But why create such a dynamic character only to make them fate’s piñata? —T.M.A. Baz Luhrmann’s best movie since his masterpiece Romeo + Juliet (1996) is brilliant but overlong, and Tom Hanks (65) masterfully wrestles with a flubbed role as con-man manager Colonel Tom Parker. But Austin Butler is an utter wonder as Elvis, and Baz is even better, frenetic yet nimbly precise, the camera leaping from Elvis belting the first rock hit, “That’s All Right,” to the child Elvis peeking at a Black singer performing the blues original in a wicked juke joint. Quick as a cricket, Baz’s dazzling cinematography conveys his subject’s roots in Black blues and gospel, and Gary Clark Jr., Kevin Harrison Jr., Yola, Shonka Dukureh and Alton Mason are superb as influencers Arthur Crudup, B.B. King, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Big Mama Thornton and Little Richard. Hanks does his best as Parker, narrating the King’s heroic, tragic arc while robbing and ruining him with carny marketing and god-awful films. Elvis balks when Parker tries to make him sing songs like “What Child Is This?” — Parker calls it “Whose Child Is This?” — in a cheesy Christmas special. But he permits Parker to imprison him in Vegas, doped up, instead of touring the world. Baz makes Parker almost nice, vague when the movie (and authenticity) need him to be vividly villainous. Still, you likely won’t see a more original film this year. —T.A. The charming YouTube-sensation short about a brave, inch-tall seashell (voiced by Jenny Slate) gets the full feature treatment, demonstrating a gigantic heart and an easygoing humor. The animated and live-action film follows the bighearted shell-on-sneakers as he navigates the disappearance in the night of a huge portion of his extended family, the diminishing abilities of his beloved immigrant Nana (the sly, moving vocal talent of Isabella Rossellini, 70) and a quest to recover his community with a little help from a heartbroken documentarian (the film’s director Dean Fleischer-Camp). Like wisehearted early Pixar films (Up), Marcel the Shell With Shoes On is a treat for the whole family, and a welcome respite from cynicism, sentimentality and anything-for-a-buck-ism. —T.M.A. Sometimes hard to watch but impossible to turn away from, Good Luck to You, Leo Grande tells the story of uptight, self-conscious widow Nancy Stokes (pitch-perfect Emma Thompson, 63), who hires smooth escort Leo Grande (Daryl McCormack, 29), hoping to find the adventurous sexual fulfillment lacking in her 31-year marriage. Nancy seems as if she’ll never be able let go of her fussbudget, retired teacher persona, even presenting Leo with a list of the sex acts she wants to tick off. But just when you think the film will end with Nancy abandoning herself to Leo’s confident charms, their antiseptic meetups take an abrupt, earthy turn. Nancy pries too much, and Leo’s self-assurance proves a mask concealing an interior as messy and sad as hers. Nancy has never had an orgasm, with herself or others. But their inauspicious coupling — however temporary — results in a happy ending for both. —Dana Kennedy (D.K.) Michelle Yeoh, 59, and Jamie Lee Curtis, 63, make beautiful movies together — and I hope to see them joined in everything from Westerns to crime thrillers. In this whacked-out, exuberant, multiple-timeline sci-fi actioner, Yeoh plays Evelyn Wang, a bedraggled Chinese immigrant living above the family laundromat with her husband, Waymond (Ke Huy Quan, 50). While sandwiched between her cranky father, Gong Gong (James Hong, 93), and moody daughter, Joy (Stephanie Hsu), she finds herself on the wrong side of IRS auditor Deirdre (Curtis in a crowd-pleasing, physically comic performance). In other words, she’s doing the everywoman juggle, except that in an outrageous series of multiverses, Evelyn has to dig deep, find her inner kung fu fighter, make peace with Joy (who often appears in outrageous costumes as her mother’s multiverse antagonist), Waymond and Gong Gong, and save the world. Spoiler alert: She succeeds — and global audiences will emerge feeling like winners, too. —T.M.A. Tim Appelo covers entertainment and is the film and TV critic for AARP.

"Feb 18, 2022","Makes me wonder why someone didnt find the gold before, since it's rooted in available history, and the two white men break into ancient buildings in broad daylight with no blowback. Wahlberg says ""kid"" more than a goat shepherd in the herd's nursery.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," Serviceable is the gold standard one can hope for when dealing with a slick intellectual property flick whose inspiration comes to the screen via video game, and, honestly, that's fine. After all, if you buy a ticket for a treasure-hunt action throw-down starring Spider-Man and Max Payne, from the director of ""Venom,"" you aren't expecting ""Cries & Whispers."" The plot of ""Uncharted"" hurtles past as if shot from a circus cannon: Nate Drake (Tom Holland), a vagabond would-be adventurer, wasting away as a nifty bartender at a Manhattan bar, hooks up with Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), an antiquities dealer, who claims to have known Nathan's long-lost brother Sam (Rudy Pankow), as the pair embark on a quest to find Magellan's legendary lost gold. Along the way, they meet up with Chloe (Sophia Ali), a fellow treasure-seeker, and run afoul of a fierce dynamo named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), bodyguard and operative for Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a rich, distant relative of Magellan's original sponsors, who very much wants to find the gold himself and restore it to his family's line. Naturally, everyone swindles and betrays everyone else, over and over -- save for Nate, who has a deeper code of honor than his compatriots -- as the action swings from Barcelona to the Philippines, and more and more escape-room level clues are discovered and deciphered, primarily by Nate, en route to an appropriately nonsensical climax putting many of the aforementioned elements in play. To the film's credit, it doesn't bother with a lot of plot articulation, or get mired in what one might call logistical details, but it also doesn't pretend for one moment otherwise (numerous times, the film helpfully cuts from characters needing to sneak through a seemingly impenetrable phalanx of guards, to them already somehow having done so). In the process, staying true to its gaming roots, it also avoids getting bogged down with much of anything other than chases, escapes, and extended, heavy stunt sequences with a minimum of fuss, some of which are pretty entertaining. It also makes few bones about its influences beyond the PS joystick, or at least the most obvious one: ""Nuns,"" former catholic schoolboy Nate laments, in an obvious Indiana Jones reference, upon having to enter an ancient church, ""why does it always have to be nuns?"" In fact, as a testament to its impatience, the film opens with one of its more audacious setups, in literal midflight: Nate wakes up, as if from a nap, while dangling by a foot strap from a giant packing crate attached to a line of similar crates, currently hanging off the back of a plane flying high above the Philippine Sea. If that were not enough, he also has various baddies taking shots at him from all angles, a promisingly desperate contretemps that only gets resolved much later on, after the rest of the breathless narrative has finally caught up to it. For a film like this, you pretty much just need your leads to stay out of their own way, something Holland -- all batting eyes, snappy banter, and flashy parkour, like a street-savvy, gin-slinging Peter Parker -- seems to have an easier time with than Wahlberg (as one critic put it, post-screening, it feels like he really wanted to be the lead). One gets the sense he'd much rather be the one everyone calls ""kid,"" solving everything and having all the fun, which puts him a bit at odds with the actual flow of his mentor character. There are the usual sorts of CGI action sequences, of course -- at one point, we have dueling three-mast carracks held aloft by a pair of lift-copters high above the sea -- and more treasure map flim-flam than the back of a Denny's kids' menu, but it's mostly in good (if not particularly clever) fun, entertaining enough, but with the nutritional value of a bag of Twizzlers. There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours, for the most part, although even this mindless escapism comes with an agenda: Sony clearly has plans to expand the Uncharted franchise (somewhat shamelessly, the film's bonus, midcredits sequence ends on a cliff-hanger), promising to ram yet another extended galaxy into an already crowded solar system.

"Feb 18, 2022"," After Tom Holland so skillfully swung from building to building in the last three Spider-Man movies, he is back a little more earthbound in his latest flick — though actually they still have him swinging from dangerous lighting fixtures, dangling from a helicopter and freefalling without a net. It is all for the film adaptation of the popular PlayStation video game Uncharted, in which Holland as treasure hunter Nathan Drake is teamed with a crafty and somewhat reliable older mentor played by Mark Wahlberg. This big-scale action movie has been in development so long at Sony in fact that Wahlberg originally had been attached play Drake, until the fiftysomething actor aged out of it waiting for the green light. In the scheme of things, being able to cash in on Holland’s enormous popularity thanks to the latest Spider-Man trilogy (the current Spider Man: No Way Home just became the third-biggest grosser in domestic box office history), the long wait for fans of this game seems poised to pay off. As for the movie itself, it is all too familiar if passable entertainment for undemanding audiences. Thanks to some nice chemistry between its stars and smart casting of its two more intriguing female roles, it is much better than the script from Rafe Lee Junkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway they are handed. It basically is a mishmash of so many movie franchises of the past few decades that it feels like a sequel rather than an original hoped-for franchise starter. Take a little Tomb Raider, throw in some Indiana Jones, add more than a touch of National Treasure and pepper it with some heist movies like Ocean’s 11, 12, 13 and even 8, then blend it all together with the familiar tropes of 100 other mismatched buddy movies and voila you have the recipe for Uncharted.  Give credit to director Ruben Fleischer for never letting it come up for air, and keeping the action flowing for nearly two hours as carefree bartender Drake (shades of Tom Cruise in Cocktail turn up in one early sequence) hooks up with Wahlberg’s Victor “Sully” Sullivan to find the missing 500-year-old treasure of Ferdinand Magellan. Of course as in all these things, a villainous character, Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), with a crafty henchman (or in this case a henchwoman named Braddock, nicely played by Tati Gabrielle) is there to muck up the best-laid plans. After the obligatory derring-do opening and some flashbacking exposition involving Drake and his brother, the new team schemes to steal a bejeweled gold key in plain daylight during a high-end auction (how many times have we seen this kind of scene at an auction house in movies?). Still, this set piece is I would say the most amusing and well-executed by Fleischer (Zombieland, Venom) as Sully poses as a high-rolling bidder, while Nathan is tasked with getting the power to go out at an opportune time so he can walk off with the booty amidst all the chaos. Of course nothing is that easy and Nathan meets his match with imposing security, as Sully sweats out a bidding war with Moncada, who needs this gold key to match the only other known one in order to unlock the missing treasure. Sound like video game? It is! The plan meets the first of its obstacles at the auction as Nathan must escape his captors by jumping off the railing and grabbing onto (dare I say in Spidey fashion) the ceiling-high lighting fixtures. At least that inadvertently causes enough of a distraction just as the price has gone up to $3 million for havoc to wreak and duplicitous Sully to find a way to grab the gold object on display and casually walk out, where he unexpectedly ends up in the same getaway car as — you guessed it — Nathan. Joining the pair as the adventure goes global, first to Barcelona, is Chloe (an alluring Sophia Ali), who has seemingly hooked up with Sully in past jobs but is also a person with plans of her own. The hits just keep on coming, from underwater near-death experiences to dropping out of planes astride a red sports car no less. The flying 16th century seafaring ships in the film’s last act are at least a novel twist on stunts you could swear James Bond may already have tried. Holland, again sporting his Peter Parker-style American accent, and Wahlberg, one of the most reliable actors around to keep this kind of nonsense grounded, are a couple of gents it is pleasant to spend time with. I have to wonder though why Banderas was intrigued enough to take such a one-dimensional and uninteresting heavy. For an actor this exceptional he just doesn’t register at all. Both Ali and Gabrielle fill the adversary bill much better at different points. And yes, in case you are hoping this is first of many Uncharted movies to come, stay through the first half of the closing credits. Or better yet, just dust off your old video game and create your own sequel instead.

"Feb 18, 2022"," Movies based on previously existing material, especially very popular material within a very niche market, must walk an extremely thin line. They have to figure out how much from their source should be included, all while making it accessible and appealing to the wider audience a film version will reach. Based upon a popular video game franchise, the new movie Uncharted faces this dilemma. Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is a bartender with a penchant for petty thievery and an obsession with the lost treasure of Magellan, something he picked up from his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) when they were orphans. He's approached by Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), an old friend of Sam, who is very close to finding the treasure, but can use Nate's help figuring out the last few pieces. Their first stop is an auction house where they attempt to ""procure"" an ancient cross linked to the treasure before Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) can get his hands upon it. This leads them to Barcelona, where they meet up with Sully's other partner in the expedition, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). Throughout this mission, they are also pursued by Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), a mercenary hired by Moncada who Sully has tangled with in the past. Now, I'm not a gamer. Let me rephrase: I'm no longer a gamer. The last system I owned was a PlayStation 2, and since then I've had neither the free time nor the manual dexterity required to become proficient at modern games. So, I'm a member of that previously mentioned wider audience to whom Uncharted needs to appeal. Though being plugged into Nerd Culture, I have some knowledge of the games, which puts me at a slight advantage to others in similar shoes. How does Uncharted play to the uninitiated, you ask (though probably without the bad pun)? It's actually quite entertaining, despite essentially being Indiana Jones Lite. It's not attempting to break any new ground in the adventure genre, it's simply striving to be an enjoyable popcorn flick and it succeeds. Director Ruben Fleischer does a much better job handling the action here than he did with Venom, and he lets the comedy flow naturally, the same way it did in his Zombieland films. I believe this proves that he works best when dealing with real people rather than CGI creations. Since the story's nothing to write home about (I know, I'll try to stop the puns), the characters are really the draw. Holland and Wahlberg are a good pair, playing off each other nicely. Banderas does his creepy best as the villain without taking things over the top. The two standouts are Ali and Gabrielle. Ali plays Chloe with genuine amiability, yet with an untrustworthy undercurrent. You're never quite certain where her loyalties lie, but you can't help liking her. On the flip side, Gabrielle's Braddock is genuinely evil, a woman who cares for nothing except the job and money it will bring her. She's definitely not to be trusted. As popcorn adventure films go, Uncharted is a fun and entertaining romp, a potential start to a franchise that I personally wouldn't mind seeing more from.

"Feb 18, 2022"," Uncharted is a fun enough action movie that certainly has its issues. However, Tom Holland shines, and the video game Easter Eggs are a blast! Uncharted is one of the best video game franchises of all time, so taking that and putting it into a movie is a bit risky. Did the Uncharted movie pay off? Well, it is certainly a lot of fun. Tom Holland does a great job of portraying a younger than we know him from the games Nathan Drake, Mark Wahlberg’s Sully leaves a lot to be desired. There is a decent amount of action, with good choreography, but it is the CGI and generic overall feel that take away from this movie. Still, I am crossing my fingers for a sequel. Uncharted follows young Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) as he reluctantly teams up with Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to hunt down the lost treasure of Magellan. He does so hoping to have the chance to see his brother again. This leads to an action packed adventure filled with puzzles and betrayal. Fans of the video games will be thrilled to know there are a lot of Easter eggs and call backs to our favorite moments — and even a special cameo that made me squeal with delight. However, it just doesn’t feel like an Uncharted movie. This film could have been rebranded as any action movie and worked just as well, if not better. One thing I really would have liked to see is Tom Holland having to frustratingly climb his way from tiny ledge to tiny ledge for a solid ten minutes because there were far too many times I felt like throwing my controller when I had to do that. There were definitely nods to this style from the game, but I would have cracked up if it just kept going. Tom Holland clearly did his research before going to set to film Uncharted. He is a great Nathan Drake. Yes, he is most definitely younger but it should be noted that he is supposed to be younger. This is a bit of a prequel to the games. Holland is easily the standout of the movie, and if you haven’t figured it out already, he has a long and successful career ahead of him.  Sophia Ali, who plays Chole Frazer, captures the spirit of this character from the games with ease. Her and Tom Holland have fantastic chemistry, and some great moments on screen together. There is a moment they are dancing at a rave and I could have watched that for at least a few more minutes — it felt cut way too short.  Antonio Banderas as villain Santiago Moncada — who feels he has a birth right to the treasure being hunted — does a really good job and honestly, I would have loved just a little bit more of him. It would have been great to see him go toe to toe with Nathan, which we never get. In the end he is a bit forgettable, but plays his part well. The plot itself is quite predictable, and there are no real shocks or surprises here. Still, the treasure hunting and puzzle solving makes for a lot of entertaining moments. When the suspense and tension needs to be there, Uncharted pulls it off. The stakes actually seem quite high at times, which can be hard to portray well on screen.  One of my biggest issues with this movie is the CGI. There are far too many moments that look so fake, it pulls you out of the movie for a second. Another thing that bothered me is the kid who plays young, young Nathan at the start of the film is supposed to be ten years old — and looks fourteen at the absolute youngest. Little details like that need to work in order for the movie overall to feel believable.  But the main thing wrong with this movie, and I feel bad saying it, is Mark Wahlberg. I do enjoy him as an actor normally, and he isn’t exactly bad in this movie, he just isn’t the right fit for the role. I don’t know if it was the writing, or his take on Sully, or what, but it just doesn’t work. He has okay enough chemistry with Holland, but the relationship between the two doesn’t feel right. Had this not been titled Uncharted, I don’t think I would have any issues with him in this movie, and that makes me feel kind of icky, and like I am relying too heavily on the games. But as a big fan of the games, it is hard not to compare. If you are looking for an action movie that is a lot of fun, then you will be pleased at the end of Uncharted. There are some CGI misses, it drags on a bit too long, and Mark Wahlberg feels out of place for nearly the entire movie. That said, Tom Holland is amazing, as is Sophia Ali and their on screen chemistry together. The puzzles are a nice touch, and there are many callbacks to the video game franchise.  Street-smart thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. What starts as a heist job for the duo becomes a globe-trotting, white-knuckle race to reach the prize before the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he and his family are the rightful heirs. If Nate and Sully can decipher the clues and solve one of the world’s oldest mysteries, they stand to find $5 billion in treasure and perhaps even Nate’s long-lost brother…but only if they can learn to work together.

"Feb 18, 2022"," If you, like me, are a sucker for movies with dimly lit, cobweb-covered secret passages, then Uncharted offers something of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it’s a movie positively filled with dimly lit, cobweb-covered secret passages. On the other hand, such scenes are often presented so unimaginatively that they lack what we’re really looking for when we look for dimly lit, cobweb-covered secret passages: atmosphere and mystery. Uncharted, directed by Ruben Fleischer and starring Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland as a pair of adventurers traversing the world looking for lost treasure, is based on the popular video game, and you can sort of tell. It has the paint-by-numbers approach to character that often afflicts video-game movies, as if the filmmakers were worried that making their protagonists too distinctive might prevent us from being able to see ourselves in them. After all, spiritually speaking, if this is a game, we should be the ones playing it, right? (Paul W.S. Anderson’s Resident Evil managed to turn this quality into an asset by giving us a blank-slate hero whose mind had been wiped clean.) As it is, the protagonists of Uncharted are blandly likable but not particularly interesting: Victor Sullivan (Wahlberg) is a globe-trotting veteran fortune hunter who connects with the younger Nate Drake (Holland), whom he finds working as a bartender and pickpocketing his customers. Victor (a.k.a. Sully), it turns out, used to work with Nate’s older brother, Sam (who went missing years ago, and whom we see in the film’s opening flashback saying good-bye to the young Nate), and wants Nate to join him in tracking down a legendary hidden treasure purported to have been found centuries ago by the explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s crew. Also looking for the treasure is Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy descendant of the family that funded Magellan’s original expedition, as well two other mercenary fortune hunters, Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), both of whom have histories with Sully. That’s not an unpromising setup: Everybody’s a thief, and they all distrust one another. But aside from a couple of predictable twists in allegiance, the script (by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway) does relatively little with that idea, in part because the story feels like it has been cobbled together from snippets of more accomplished movies: A little Pirates of the Caribbean and National Treasure here, a little Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade and The Goonies there. Uncharted has been in the works for some years, with all sorts of big-name filmmakers and actors attached to it, which might explain the hodgepodge of references and influences. Derivativeness in and of itself is not a bad thing, but the movie seems uninterested in delivering any real surprises or creating any distinctive mood of its own. Maybe it’s a video-game thing. Each scene in Uncharted seems to wipe clean the memory of the previous one. A bad guy left behind in another room doesn’t feel like much of a threat once you enter a new room. We’re told our heroes are brilliant, but that’s not really reflected in any of their banter. (“Holy shit” seems to be the go-to exclamation.) Nobody ever seems to use their wits, just the objects they possess. And none of the solutions to any of the film’s mysteries is particularly clever; they feel like they’re just there to advance our characters to the next plot point. (Surely the combined brainpower and salaries of all the screenwriters who have worked on this project over the past decade-plus could have come up with something more imaginative than … invisible ink?) Even the backstory of Nate’s brother, Sam, and the young man’s sorrow at his disappearance feel more like a dutiful bit of box-checking than anything that might provide emotional resonance. Maybe such disconnects happen because the film is obsessed with forward momentum. And it does bounce along fairly well; Uncharted is nothing if not fast. Alas, the movie rarely builds any real menace, so any excitement it might generate dissipates rather quickly. There are two notable exceptions to the picture’s general sense of competent, corporate anonymity. Banderas does manage to give his character an entertainingly nasty sense of entitlement and gets some interesting (albeit brief) emotional shading in scenes with his aging, wealthy, idealistic father (Manuel de Blas). There’s also a tremendous climactic action sequence, involving a massive helicopter-and-pirate-ship chase, which delivers the kind of spectacle the rest of the film lacks. It’s intricate, exciting, even surprising; the whole movie might be worth it for that sequence alone. But such high points also serve to remind us of what we’ve been missing. Uncharted is not so much unenjoyable as it is curiously empty.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 18, 2022"," This project has been in development hell for over a decade. I actually have blogged about it in 2010 when Mark Wahlberg was still attached to play Nathan Drake, though whenever I look at the video game rendering of the character, I always thought Nathan Fillion would’ve been perfect. I also listed Richard Armitage as one of the actors I wish had been cast, though ALL of those actors are now too old for the part. Heck, even the 50-year-old Wahlberg aged out of the role (he was in his late 30s when he was originally attached), so now we’ve got an origin story of Drake, played by 25-year-old Tom Holland. The movie opens with younger Nathan with his brother Sam as they get arrested when they got caught trying to steal the first map after the Magellan expedition. Sam escapes while Nathan gets sent back to the orphanage, and that’s the last time they ever see each other. Fast forward 15 years later and Nathan is now a street smart bartender and a stealthy pick pocketer. He gets recruited by a treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan who apparently had worked with Sam to recover a 500-year-old lost treasure worth billions. As if that weren’t challenging enough, they’d have to make sure another ruthless treasure hunter doesn’t get to it first. There’s only SO many stories that can be told in treasure hunt movies like Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, Pirates of the Caribbean, National Treasure, etc. that the plot get pretty derivative. Uncharted doesn’t exactly chart a new territory in the action adventure genre, in fact it’s basically a variation of the franchise movies I’ve mentioned, combined with the preposterousness of the Fast & Furious flicks. Well, except it’s not quite as fast-paced as one expects for an action comedy. In fact, the movie doesn’t really gets its mojo until in the third act. I mean, there are a ton of action stuff moving at breakneck speed, but the film’s energy is stagnant, it’s as if the characters are just going through the motion. Now the action scenes are pretty decent, nothing that would go down amongst the classics like the one is Indiana Jones, but they’re thrilling enough when I watched it on the big screen. The auction house chase where Tom Holland makes the most of his Spider-man skills swinging from sleek-looking chandelier is pretty crazy, as is the scene where he falls out of a plane. Of course ludicrous action scenes are par the course in a fantasy action flick, how else are we supposed to believe a kid can hang on to a cargo net out of a flying plane while dodging huge cargo containers, even a car, without suffering any broken bones! The humorous action reminds me of Jackie Chan movies and Holland has proven to be the nimblest young action star working today.  As for the casting, the chemistry between Wahlberg and Holland seemed pretty good in the trailer, but in the movie it doesn’t always jibe. I’ve seen far better action duo, heck even Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham have a more riotous chemistry in Hobbs & Shaw, perhaps because they’re on an even playing field so it’s fun watching them insult each other. The funniest bit is actually the one in the trailer, involving British character actor Steven Waddington’s wild Scottish accent, ahah. I have to admit that Holland has a strong screen presence though to date, he’s still the best at playing Spider-man. As for Wahlberg, he certainly still has a youthful physique and energy to match, but he’s not exactly a charismatic action star like Tom Cruise who’s electrifying to watch in those Mission Impossible movies. But at least I was mildly entertained when the two of them are on screen, but whenever each of them was paired up with the supporting cast, the movie’s energy dips almost right away. That’s not to say that Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle aren’t good, I think both actresses did as well as they could with the parts they’re given. Ali fares a bit better overall as she looks like she’s having fun doing treasure hunting, while Gabrielle basically just have to look cool as a bloodthirsty villainess . Hopefully they get better parts in future projects that actually showcase their acting prowess. The biggest blunder of this movie is completely wasting Antonio Banderas. His character Santiago Moncada sure has a cool name and pedigree but it doesn’t amount to much at all. I was left scratching my head why the veteran actor would even agree to such a stupid role. Yes I figure a dump truck full of cash is probably involved in the contract, but still.  Director by Ruben Fleischer is no stranger to popcorn cinema with mixed results. I enjoyed Venom and Zombieland but abhor the dull and shallow Gangster Squad. This one isn’t exactly abhorrent, but under more capable hands, this movie could’ve been more intriguing and suspenseful. As it is, Uncharted is a serviceable crowd pleaser, that is the kind of crowd who don’t expect much from a piece of entertainment. For me, I’d likely have forgotten all about it until promos of the inevitable sequels roll around.  It’s likely I’ll see this on Starz but I’ll be bored by it because it looks so generic.  I love Tom Holland but I ain’t seeing this and I’m starting to get bored by Mark Wahlberg right now as he’s just not making interesting films these days.  It seems like he’s doing the same old shit whether it’s a generic family comedy or this. Tom Holland is pretty good in the role, I think he’s a really likable actor which explains why he’s a box office catnip, good for him! Yeah Mark Wahlberg isn’t the most interesting presence on screen, though he seems like a really nice guy from his interviews, clearly he’s transformed himself from his bad boy days of Marky Mark. Oh wow, clearly I’m out of touch w/ celebrity couples, I had no idea Jenny McCarthy is married to Donnie Wahlberg (and I used to love NKOTB when I was 15!), too bad she’s an anti-vaxer, ugh. And the things she says just make things even worse as I’m wondering why no one has arrested her for the deaths of children through her stupid views.  Plus, I’m not surprised she applauded for Rudy Giuliani at a taping of The Masked Singer.  You know things are really fucked up when you have Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke walking out of the show because of him. Oh I did hear on MPR about the jury member walking out on Giuliani at the Masked Singer, but didn’t know the details. I was so surprised WHY anyone would even ask someone like that to be on the show, that’s just stupid! I still don’t get why Hollywood is so obsess with turning popular video games into movies. With the exception of the original Mortal Combat and Tomb Raider films, none of them were box office hits. Yet each year we get new films based on video games.  I totally forgot about this one since it’s been in development for years and was surprised they actually finished this version. Lol! I might watch it when it hits Netflix or Amazon Prime. Yeah, video game movies aren’t my thing at all though this one is okay because I generally like treasure hunt type of movies. It’s crazy how long this one takes to finally get made, I think originally Wahlberg was gonna star in it w/ David O’ Russell directing and even De Niro was attached to play Sully. I feel like Hollywood is basically doing what a lot of people are doing when they go down to Vegas, including myself. Throwing a lot of money away hoping to hit that one big jackpot, so far they haven’t won anything big yet with these films based on video games. Film is in my blood.

"Feb 18, 2022"," UNCHARTED is like the first pitch meeting to potential financiers, which is odd since it’s been in development for almost a decade. What we have here is the broad outline of a plot full of twists, turns, and aerial stunts. What we don’t have is any sense of order or logic, even that of the video game on which it is based. With a light-hearted action/adventure flick such as this fancies itself to be, that is not an unsurmountable obstacle. Alas, there is nothing in the direction, writing, or characters that allows us to be distracted from that problem. Instead, we have two set pieces that are, if not breathtaking, at least interesting in a haven’t-seen-that-before plus a slick heist interlude, none of which justify the rest of the exercise. We begin in media res, with Nate Drake (Tom Holland) falling through space before fighting his way back onto a plane with gravity, windshear, and a host of baddies attempting to stop him. Flash back 15 years, and we see the much younger Nate (Tiernan Jones) being swept up into the fortune-hunting dreams of his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), no to mention his disregard for any legalities in his way. No better to give us the necessary exposition about finding the lost gold of Magellan, and why the now adult Nate, a light-fingered bartender and trivia whiz, would want to get involved with Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a mysterious, and none too straight-arrow stranger who also dreams of finding that treasure. His hook for Nate? He claims to have been on the search with Sam before Nate was ghosted by him. Sully already has the treasure map, what he doesn’t have is the key that will allow him to unlock the hoard. Actually, what he needs is the second key, both in the forms of solid gold crosses that Magellan’s crew had made up after hiding the treasure. Two because they didn’t trust each other any more that Nate trusts Sully, or either of the trust Chloe Frasier (Sophia Ali), the fleet-footed holder of the other key who meets up with them in Barcelona. Before you can say yo ho ho and a bottle of rum, the three of them are wending their way through Barcelona on a scavenger hunt that serves to remind us of how clever and well-plotted Dan Brown’s novels are, and how this flick is not. The premise of renegade sailors having the wherewithal to create such an elaborate hunt is never explained, nor why hard-boiled mistrustful characters suddenly change their personas, only to change them back again when the story needs another twist. Also never explained is why the villain of the piece (Antonio Bandaras), a man proven to have no qualms about killing anyone who fails him, continues to employ Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), a knife-wielding hit-woman with even fewer qualms, when she repeatedly lets him down. It must be because Ms. Gabrielle looks so good when scuffling with anyone who gets in her way, and so she’s kept on until the bitter end. There is a pungent lack of chemistry between any of the protagonists, not helped by bantering dialogue that falls flat 90% of the time. Holland and Wahlberg, both able thespians who have proven themselves capable of delivering quality work when the material allows then to, are left stranded, leaving us to cringe with empathy for the waste of talent. They are not helped by pedestrian direction that saps any remaining fun from the proceedings, and haphazard editing. For his part, Banderes relies on a series of leers, while Frazer is left with little to do but be feisty, and Gabrielle to assume an expression of deadpan menace from beneath a hairstyle remarkable for the intricate symmetry of its ebullient streaks. The coiffure may, in fact, be the most accomplished item in this otherwise ungainly excrescence. UNCHARTED botches more opportunities than is worth enumerating. That irksome quality allows us, nay, compels us, to remove ourselves from what is happening for a few rounds of “where are the local police during this extended brawl?” and “how does that person still possess that accessory after freefalling through space from a very high altitude then plummeting into the sea?” and “why isn’t someone being asked for a passport, or even an ID, at this juncture?”  The overwhelming emotion while enduring it is shock and awe that any movie could so boldly make so many missteps with such blithe disregard for all involved, including us.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022","  UNCHARTED is based on a phenomenally successful series of PlayStation videogames about treasure hunter Nathan Drake. It’s a rather strange name, at least for this movie, given that so much of it is involved with following maps that lead to other maps, although the title HIGHLY CHARTED wouldn’t have quite the same snap. UNCHARTED starts at the top of its third act with a wild action sequence, that has Nathan (Tom Holland) trying to avoid plunging to his death by clinging to cargo boxes that are falling out of an airplane. We flash back to Nathan’s childhood. He and beloved older brother Sam are living at a Catholic orphanage. Both boys are already fascinated by antiquities. When Sam tries to steal a map from a museum, he must flee to avoid arrest, promising Nathan they’ll be reunited someday. In the present, “someday” still hasn’t arrived. Nathan has evolved into a pickpocket and thief, though his main job is as a New York bartender. One evening, Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) comes into the bar to recruit Nathan to help him with a big job. Nate initially declines – he doesn’t trust Sully – but there’s historical allure in the adventure: finding the all of the gold supposedly hidden by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in the early sixteen century. Besides, Sully has had contact with Sam, and Nathan is keen to find his brother, who’s gone silent for the last two years. Sully and Sam aren’t the only ones after the gold. Sully’s former associate Chloe (Sophia Ali) reluctantly teams up with them, and Sully’s ex Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) is in the employ of wealthy Spaniard Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes he has a familiar right to the treasure. The opening is great, with outrageous perils flying at us and Nathan nonstop. Director Ruben Fleischer consistently displays strong imagination when it comes to the action set pieces, and once we get through the set-up, these come fast and furious. However, unlike FAST AND FURIOUS, or more to the point, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (a clear point of inspiration here, even though this is contemporary), UNCHARTED doesn’t know how to make us care for its characters. The filmmakers have made a wise investment in actor Holland, who projects innate charm and decency as Nathan. But writers Rafe Judkins and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway, working from a screen story by Judkins and Jon Hanley Rosenberg & Mark D. Walker, make Sully too amoral and scummy. We’re not rooting for a friendship to bloom. When the expected finally happens, it feels like it’s preordained by marketing algorithms, rather than something that’s evolved organically between the two men. This isn’t to say all successful caper movies are required to have great interpersonal bonds and a just cause. For example, David Mamet is a writer/filmmaker who can tell compelling stories about unsavory figures trying to forge perilous paths, but he’s not involved here, and UNCHARTED is aiming for a much lighter tone in any case. In RAIDERS, Indy does have some loyal helpers and is fighting Nazis (causes don’t get more just). In the FAST AND FURIOUS franchise, yeah, everybody is stealing cars, but there’s loyalty. In OCEAN’S ELEVEN, camaraderie is half of why we’re watching. In UNCHARTED, Sully is driven by greed, and everyone we encounter who knows him detests him. We’re not encouraged to root for his opponents, either. The dialogue, though it is relatively clunker-free, is glib rather than clever. Also, while the action is conceptually splendid, there are too many places where we can tell it’s CGI rather than practical (no problem in a videogame, but an issue in a live-action feature). There are two mid-end credits sequences in UNCHARTED which suggest a sequel is planned. If a follow-up is made, perhaps it will better match its execution to its ambitions.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," Don’t expect to see Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg stretch their talents in this action adventure based on a video game. Once the Playstation controller is out of hand and the game player becomes a theatre audience member, the audacious, ridiculous action sequences are just that. Without being in control of the action it just isn’t as much fun. This film has been on Sony’s radar since 2008 so just getting it made is a minor triumph. Holland as Nate, is a talking action-ready junkie whose ability as a bartender to juggle bar ware making cocktails is impressive. Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan is the snide, sarcastic opportunist. The only positive notes come in the interplay between the two. Their sarcastic back and forth patter is well written by Rare Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. The pacing from Director Ruben Fleischer is similar to the patter that worked so well for him in Venom.  Anyone who plays action-adventure video games expects the characters can do impossible stunts and survive every certain-death challenge. But translating that vibe to the big screen doesn’t work here. Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon’s shots at times seem constrained by the COVID production protocols, especially the frequent close-ups of Holland clearly shot in front of a green screen.  Nate and “Sully” bounce from being selfish rogues to buddies. Nate is the sentimental compatriot, hoping against hope that he can re-unite with his missing brother Sam. Nate and Sam were living in an orphanage together until Sam ran off after a botched burglary. He thinks Sam ran off to follow his dream to find the ships of Magellan filled with gold that were lost 500 years ago.  Sully is a professional treasure hunter always looking for the ultimate “big score.” Thinking Nate may have clues from Sam, he recruits Nate to unlock the mystery surrounding Magellan’s lost ships and the billions of gold in the hold. While Sully is a bit more realistic in his desire to avoid risking life and limb, Nate is all-in, all the time. The big action sequence in the hold of a cargo plane and the battle played out in mid-air without a parachute is just outrageous and outlandish. Tom Holland might as well be an animated character because it’s so cartoon-like, yet you have to watch to see how he’s get out of it.  Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) leads the cadre of seems-to-be-good but is really one of bad guys. Braddock is strikingly beautiful, but has a lethal sneer. She’s just the kind of diabolical character a movie like this needs. She’s single minded in her efforts to steal the vast Magellan gold for her boss, Moncada (Antonio Banderas) who always speaks in a low, gravelly growl, apparently to let us know he’s evil, too. Banderas is capable of more.  Chloe Frazier (Sophia Ali) is a little more complicated, since she’s somewhat conflicted about whether to throw in with Nate and Sully, or throw them under the bus. Nate has been given a nicely nuanced relationship with her. It thankfully makes their time on screen more than just gun play and fight scenes. It’s worth noting that this film received a PG-13 rating despite the violence and the almost constant profane language. It shows the evolution of what has become acceptable family entertainment.  The eye-popping CGI stunts and third act air duel featuring 500 year old ships steered by helicopter don’t score movie gold. The mid-credit tease clearly indicates the Playstation bosses are hoping for this to start a franchise. But a second installment of will need more than video game gimmicks to make it worth seeing.  While Wahlberg and Holland have star power and on-screen chemistry, this is the kind of film that should have us on the edge of our seats instead of looking at the clock. Unfortunately Uncharted is uninteresting, untenable and unbelievable. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," The filmmakers behind Uncharted give a modest effort in fleshing out the narrative structure and providing a back story for the protagonist of the eponymous adventure game without sacrificing the spirit of the source material. However, the film struggles to develop meaningful character depth and emotional complexity amid its barrage of elaborate globetrotting set pieces that are its very reason for existence — settling for a standard-issue buddy comedy in the vein of the National Treasure or, um, Tomb Raider franchises. For those unfamiliar, the story follows Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), a brash bartender and petty criminal who is recruited by a treasure hunter nicknamed Sully (Mark Wahlberg) for his latest scheme involving a centuries-old fortune once belonging to Ferdinand Magellan. The plan spares no expense when the jackpot totals billions. As the duo jets to exotic locales in search of clues, the bigger issue becomes whether they can stop bickering long enough with one another and a quick-witted associate (Sophie Ali) to focus on the task at hand. Then there’s the claim by ruthless aristocrat Santiago (Antonio Banderas) that his Moncada family is the rightful heir to the prize, citing a historical connection. From there, it turns into a high-stakes role-playing contest of finders-keepers, losers-weepers. Keeping his action-hero credentials tuned up between Spider-Man installments, Holland flashes his usual charisma and physical dexterity even as the screenplay provides minimal rooting interest. Plus, the chemistry with Wahlberg feels strained. Neither the heroes nor the villains — plus an alluring femme fatale (Tati Gabrielle) — are especially compelling beyond superficial means, even as they trade intermittently amusing wisecracks and self-aware Indiana Jones winks. As directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland), the mostly innocuous and inconsequential film sparks to life with a visually striking collection of chases and confrontations and perilous near-death escapes. From rooftop parkour to a harrowing airborne rescue, the technical proficiency is stylish. There are obvious hints at franchise aspirations along the way. Yet by falling victim to familiar genre pitfalls, the course for Uncharted only leads to a dead end.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," Jones-ing for Indiana Jones? Don’t expect “Uncharted” to fill that need. The film, directed by Ruben Fleischer of the blighted “Venom” entries and written by Rafe Judkins (TV’s “The Wheel of Time”), Art Marcum and Matt Holloway (“Men in Black: International”), is based on the popular Sony PlayStation video game of the same name and is shoddy and utterly lacking in charm or wit. The film teams Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland as fortune hunters on the trail of Ferdinand Magellan’s legendary lost gold. Wahlberg is supposed to be some international man of intrigue, who specializes in finding treasure. Believe me, Wahlberg is like the world’s least likely person to play an international man of intrigue. The film starts with Holland’s Nate Drake, descendant of none other than Sir Francis Drake, falling through the sky attached to a line of cargo trailing out of a transport plane. Nate hops around, holds on for dear life and fights attackers like your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man because that is who he is. We then flashback to Boston 15 years earlier where Nate (Tiernan Jones) and his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) are separated when Sam flees town after they are caught trying to rob a museum. Cut to present-day New York City, where Nate is pretending to be Tom Cruise in “Cocktail” at a neighborhood watering hole, and he meets Wahlberg’s Victor “Sully” Sullivan, who claims to know Sam. Sully recruits Nate to help get their hands on a fabled golden jeweled cross. Also trying to possess this MacGuffin is villainous Spaniard Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas). Santiago has a deadly female associate named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, “The 100”), who has a trademark hairstyle and wields a deadly knife. The plot will further involve crosses also serving as keys to secret chambers built in the 16th century, trips to Barcelona and the Philippines, a bad guy (Steven Waddington) with an indecipherable Scots accent, foot chases, car chases, shots fired and lot of not very credible action up in the sky. Among the lame cloak-and-dagger elements in the story is that mainstay of American childhood: invisible writing. Wahlberg, showing off his boulder-sized, middle-aged biceps, and Holland, the star of the box-office bonanza “Spider Man: No Way Home,” have zero chemistry. The film is “The Da Vinci Code” for people who found that effort too cerebral. In one sequence set in Barcelona, Nate and frenemy Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, TV’s “Grey’s Anatomy”) are trapped underground in a chamber filling with water, while Sully watches from ground level through a grate. Like the rest of the film, I felt like I had seen this done better elsewhere. Nate suspects that old postcards from Sam might contain clues. Sully frequently calls Nate “kid.” Captions such as “Somewhere in the Banda Sea” appear at regular intervals. My guess is that when you’re looking for gold, “Calle de Oro” is the place to be. Banderas has seldom had a less memorable screen role.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," “Uncharted,” you say? That’s a funny title for an action-adventure movie that doesn’t stray one inch from the well-trodden path of what came before it.  “Indiana Jones,” “National Treasure” and “The Mummy,” just to name a few, are all dead ringers for this poorly written buddy quest film — and leagues better, too. I suggest a different name for the latest entry in the genre: “Derivative!” Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, a flirty bartender/pickpocket in Manhattan who lives in an apartment with a floor-to-ceiling window wall overlooking the city (I’m guessing making gin and tonics didn’t pay for that view). One night during a bar shift, a treasure hunter named Sully (Mark Wahlberg in meathead mode) asks Nathan to help him search for the lost gold of Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan.  (If Nathan can afford a one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, I don’t think a $400 round-trip ticket to Barcelona — the next place the pair goes — is that fantastical an expenditure.) Sully, it turns out, is a friend of Nathan’s lost older brother, who abandoned him at an orphanage years earlier to explore the world. So, if they find the loot, chances are they find the big bro. The actors adopt a tired partner dynamic: Wahlberg’s Sully is slow, masculine and doesn’t know how to use a cellphone; Holland’s Nathan can do parkour and knows more about history than a tenured university professor. Siri could write this. They then steal a vital golden cross at a Soho auction house and jet off to Spain (a place you’ve only read about in books!) to follow ancient clues engraved on church walls, “Da Vinci Code”-style.  The villain is Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), the heir to a Medici-like Spanish family, who wants the gold too. He hires Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), a bland and vague femme fatale, to get to the doubloons first.  Nathan and Sully are joined by Chloe (Sophia Ali, wonderful in “India Sweets and Spices”), who’s angry all the time. The umpteenth occasion in which one of the three double-crosses the other two, you check your watch. The script by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway — based on the video game — knows it’s borrowing generously from what came before it. Inside one cathedral, Nathan yells, “Nuns! Why does it always have to be nuns?!,” sending up Indiana Jones’ famous line about snakes. The cute nods would be fine if the movie matched its predecessors’ energy and escapism.  “Uncharted” is part of the valiant effort to make a bona fide star out of Tom Holland separate from his extremely popular “Spider-Man” movies. The British kid’s been everywhere and nowhere lately. From 2020 to 2021, he starred in “The Devil All the Time,” “Chaos Walking” and “Cherry.” The projects were bland, his talent stood out and nobody watched them. “Uncharted” will likely follow suit.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," While enthusiasts of the game might find the adaptation of the game series on point, for audiences going in cold, it’s likely that the new Tom Holland & Mark Wahlberg film will merely play (heh) like a mash-up of better, more inspired adventure films.  Obvious pre-cursors include Indiana Jones (which gets name dropped), National Treasure, The Mummy, and Lara Croft (itself a video game adaptation). The reality is that Uncharted‘s tale of thieves who form an uneasy alliance to discover lost gold feels too heavily indebted to its action predecessors. One wishes the new film were doing something a little more fresh. On paper Uncharted makes perfect sense: Holland as the plucky, incredibly fit Nathan Drake who is recruited for an shady mission by Wahlberg’s Sully. Throw in a dash of sexual tension with Sophia Ali’s Chloe Frazer and zest with conflict from a pair of not so nefarious baddies played by Antonio Banderas and The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina’s Tati Gabrielle. Finally, alternate sprinkling in jumping/aerial stunt work with Holland taking his shirt off (or at least get soaking wet) every twenty minutes or so. Sit back and wait for the money to roll in. Screenwriters Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway attempt to ground the film emotionally with a backstory about Nathan and his absent older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow). The orphans were separated as teens and Nathan’s desire to be reunited is the rationale for his willingness to embark so cavalierly on a dangerous mission.  Alas the idolization of Sam feels rote and shallow. So, too, does the mentorship between Sully and Nathan, which happens far too quickly and in unconvincing fashion (Wahlberg, in particular, stands out as a poor casting choice: he has neither the charm nor the comedic chops to banter with Holland and his line delivery frequently falls flat). Following an exciting(ish?) heist to retrieve a golden cross up for auction in New York, the action moves to Barcelona where Chloe, the third member of the crew is introduced. While the ensuing parkour foot chase is mildly diverting, the fact that this (and every other set piece, most of them in very public places) draws zero attention from bystanders or police is a mildly annoying issue that the film never bothers to address.  The three criminals proceed to form an uneasy alliance wherein no one trusts anyone, but they nevertheless agree to work together to decipher a series of clues and find the gold. Unfortunately every character relationship is undermined by at least one double (if not triple) cross, all of which are clearly telegraphed and become increasingly exhausting as the film goes on. The “no one trusts anyone” angle doesn’t make for compelling conflict, especially when it occurs approximately every ten minutes. Once is a betrayal; by the fifth time, it’s hard to summon enough energy to care.* *This also applies to the film’s tendency to treat the audience like morons: not only does Uncharted rely on the tired trope of opening the film with an in-media-res action scene to generate interest (it takes more than an hour to catch back up), but Sam repeatedly reads in voice-over the text of his one-sentence postcards, which are written and displayed in gigantic font. We can read, movie! Performance-wise, Holland is fit as hell and game for anything, but Nathan’s vocal expressions and mannerisms too often evoke Peter Parker and comparisons to Spiderman. Holland’s banter with Wahlberg ranges from fine (at best) to painful (at worst), which basically describes Wahlberg’s overall contribution to the film. The women, meanwhile, are underwritten and exist primarily to look great and betray the men. Even Banderas, who is normally so reliable, feels neutered and lacks energy; he’s under utilized and even when he’s on screen, Uncharted never quite figures out what to do with him. Therein lies Uncharted’s biggest issue: everything is about halfway successful. For every great stunt, decent joke or fun beat, there’s an accompanying disappointment, groaner or eye-roll. At nearly two hours, the film feels bloated and drawn out, particularly the plot points that are telegraphed early, then take ages to pay off. When every other moment misses, that’s a lot of time when the film isn’t working. As a franchise starter, Uncharted has promise, but the paint-by-numbers script and extravagant budget makes the sequel (teased in the closing credits – naturally) a long shot. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," Street-smart Nathan Drake, is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter, Victor “Sully” Sullivan, to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan, and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada. Uncharted is one of those movies that isn’t particularly special in the macro but does all the little things right. An adaptation of the popular video game that’s been in the works for an unusually long period of time, it’s a globe-trotting adventure that borrows elements from everything from the Indiana Jones series to National Treasure.  I didn’t care much at all about the treasure-hunting plot, or about any of the numerous MacGuffins that are dealt with along the way. But I enjoyed the banter among the characters, most of the action, and the photography of the locations.  Director Ruben Fleischer has had a mixed career, having made the enjoyable first Zombieland movie, the less-good second one, and also subpar stuff like 30 Minutes or Less and Gangster Squad. He made the first Venom movie, which I despised but others seemed to have liked, back in 2018. But Uncharted is much better than his other recent efforts.  The film stars current Spider-man Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, a bartender, pickpocket, and aspiring treasure hunter. In possession of postcards from his long-lost brother, he dreams of going around the world to find billions in lost gold.  A more established treasure hunter, Victor “Sully” Sullivan, offers to help him on that mission, and they’re soon joined by Chloe Frazier (Sophia Ali), although whether they can trust one another is another question entirely. There’s also a rival team of treasure hunters, led by Antonio Banderas, and assisted by both a badass female fighter (Tati Gabrielle) and a large Scottish henchman whose accent is unintelligible (Steven Waddington.) Uncharted, like so many films in the genre, jumps around the world, with sequences set in New York, Barcelona, and Southeast Asia. There’s also one sequence, set on a plane and outside of it, that makes the physics and gravitational traditions of the Fast and Furious movies look like something from a documentary.  There are some very good action scenes, including a brawl at a high-end auction house that’s a better version of something we’ve all seen many times, and a complex bit in which one character has to save two others from drowning by breaking glass in a Papa John’s (sounds silly, I know, but just go with it.) The final sequence, involving boats and helicopters, is rather incoherent.  Holland is fine in the role. He tried to stretch his persona to play a drug-dealing bank robber in 2020’s Cherry, with disastrous results, but he’s better here. And somehow, this is the first time in his career that Mark Wahlberg has portrayed a character named “Sully”; I would have guessed he’d had done so at least three or four times already.  Would any of the interminable other versions of Uncharted that almost happened have turned out better than this one? I guess we’ll never know. But the one we got is already the year’s most overachieving movie.  Stephen Silver is a journalist and film critic based in the Philadelphia area.

"Feb 18, 2022"," The 2009 video game “Uncharted 2: Among Thieves” begins with treasure-hunting adventurer Nathan Drake awakening to find his own blood on his hand. He’s sitting in a beat-up train car he soon discovers is hanging off a cliff in a snowy-and-mountainous part of the world. After the thrilling cinematic sequence concludes, you take control of Nathan in the equally exciting first playable moments of the game, willing — via appropriate button-pushing — Nathan’s way up and through the train before it plummets many feet to its final resting place. These opening seconds prove to be a microcosm of the long-awaited, many-times-delayed “Uncharted,” a crushingly average slice of action-adventure that will kill a couple of hours but is likely to disappoint longtime fans of the franchise. To be fair, we will return to this harrowing moment for Movie Nathan midway through the adventure to see how it plays out, and this mile-high ordeal involving, among other elements, a car and too few parachutes proves to be the film at its most thrilling. That “Uncharted” is, you know, even OK almost defies the odds, given that this project has been in development hell practically since the release of the first game, 2007’s “Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune” for PlayStation 3. Directors have come and gone, and actor Mark Walhberg, long attached to star as Nathan, has aged out of the role. A descendant of legendary English naval commander Sir Francis Drake, Nathan lives in New York City, earning money as a flashy bartender and, it would seem, using his pickpocket skills to relieve the occasional wealthy female patron of her expensive jewelry. Unbeknown to Nathan, Sully watches his little unreliable-Zippo lighter-dependent bracelet heist and tells him afterward he has a more-profitable gig to offer him. Nathan says he isn’t interested, but, after realizing Sully has relieved HIM of the bracelet, he heads to the address on the card Sully left him, Nathan swiping the keys from the building’s doorman to gain entrance. After the further obligatory refusals by the appropriately distrustful Nathan, the pair are off on a quest to find billions worth of gold apparently hidden centuries ago by explorer Ferdinand Magellan. They must start with the theft of a valuable ornate cross that literally may be a key to unlocking the treasure and also is an object of great desire by the ruthless-and-powerful Santiago Moncado (Antonio Banderas), who has in employ the highly skilled woman named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). That Braddock and Sully seem to have been frenemies with benefits only complicates matters. The story’s other major player is another relative fixture from the game series, fellow adventurer and former Sully associate Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). If Nathan and Sully are to find the gold, they must put some trust in the young, daring woman. Trust is a big theme in “Uncharted” — the specific question being whether Nathan can trust Sully. Chloe says in no uncertain terms that Nathan shouldn’t, but can she even be counted on not to betray them? The air is almost always thick with the possibility of decidedly duplicitous dealings. A few writers share the screenplay and story-by credits — Rafe Lee Judkins, showrunner of Prime Video’s “The Wheel of Time,” gets both — and they’ve cobbled together a tale that, while unremarkable, certainly shares the spirit of the games. (Given the nature of the series, a character referencing Indiana Jones is a nice touch.) Unfortunately, Fletcher, who’s best known for the “Zombieland” movies and “Venom,” fails to find a way to make “Uncharted” as engaging as it needs to be, thanks in part to action sequences that fail to rise above the ordinary. The same can be said for most of the character moments, as well. At least some of the folks once attached to direct almost certainly would have made stronger movies. However, another problem is the casting. While Holland — a big reason the recent “Spider-Man” trilogy and last year’s box-office king of a conclusion, the ambitious“Spider-Man: No Way Home,” have been so beloved — is a decent choice for this younger Nathan, we can’t say the same thing about Wahlberg (“Ted,” “Transformers: Age of Extinction”). Look, we’re thankful the virtually rangeless actor never portrayed Nathan, but he’s nothing remotely like the Video Game Sully. That won’t bother non-fans, but it’s a huge bummer. Furthermore, Banderas (“Pain and Glory”) and Gabrielle (“You”) are painfully bland as the villains, although the blame for that is shared by the writers and Fletcher. If you’ve been with the game franchise through 2016’s epic “Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End,” which may have brought Nathan’s saga to a satisfying conclusion, you almost have to see “Uncharted.”",NEUTRAL

"Feb 18, 2022"," The camaraderie between stars Wahlberg and Holland does work to some degree in “Uncharted.” They would be perfect in a remake of 1988’s Tom Cruise/Bryan Brown drama “Cocktail.” “Uncharted” will make money--millions of dollars in its opening weekend. But that has nothing to do with the film’s merit. It all comes down to the “Holland effect.” After the massive worldwide record-breaking performance of “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” Tom Holland is the newly-minted box office king. And in “Uncharted,” as fearless adventurer Nathan Drake, Holland effectively channels his likable Peter Parker youthful, plucky appeal. The super-hero adjacent character is inspired by the Sony PlayStation video game initially released in 2007. Holland’s Drake is a charmer, but he’s a thief without remorse. Case in point: while tending bar in a hip place somewhere in the big city, he suggests challenging, tasty designer cocktails to distract a rich girl. She’s not having it and arrogantly rebuffs his advances. Everyone knows that you don’t diss Holland, and her callousness provides all the justification necessary to lift the tennis bracelet from her wrist. Drake’s a criminal, one with skilled sticky fingers. And because the rich debutant was condescending and indifferent, taking the wealthy mark’s jewelry is perfectly okay. She got what she deserved. But his small-time crimes get a mega boost when he reluctantly joins forces with a suave, shadowy grave robber named Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). With a “no regrets,” smarmy slickness, Sully takes Drake on an adventurous international heist. It’s a light, surprisingly bloodless affair that gives Holland a chance to flex his web-crawling muscles. In one over-the-top action sequence that’s been teased and spoiled in the film’s trailers, Drake leaps through the air from one large, awkward, floating storage container to another, dangerously dangling from an opening in the rear of a cargo plane. As his ruthless pursuers fall horribly to their death, Drake manages to stay remarkably connected to the containers. This impossible feat is one that only Marvel’s Spidey could safely accomplish. Drake certainly has sticky fingers. Later, Drake and his possible love interest, fellow thief Chloe (Sophia Ai), cling to the hood of a falling, vintage sports car. As they plunge to the ground, they have time to bicker playfully. It’s so ridiculous that I shook my head in disbelief. And worse, the sequence isn’t even thrilling. When the action moves to a tropical island, two ancient and priceless ships are discovered preserved in a jungle cave. Of course, as seen in the trailers, the vessels are lifted using giant helicopters and roughly swung into the open skies. It’s so frustrating to see how casually this film treats these albeit fictitious relics that are based on a perversion of history. Comparisons to Disney’s “National Treasure” are inevitable. However, “Uncharted” is even more ridiculous. And “Uncharted” feels in line with the comic nonsense that failed to connect in the infamous Bruce Willis failure “Hudson Hawk.” One villain is a wealthy aristocrat named Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who hopes to stop the slide of his fading wealth through treasure hunting. And in his quest for gold, he retains the services of a mercenary named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). This partnership makes for one nasty combination of ambitions. Like the proud theft of that tennis bracelet, the dismissive, insensitive actions of the heroic adventurers are justified as long as they are one step ahead of the evil Santiago, Braddock, and her vicious minions. And, after all, there’s gold to be found. To be fair, an effort is made to humanize Drake because he’s an orphan who is just following the dreams instilled within him by his long-missing brother. Audiences these days are numb to the moral dilemmas created by the violent, destructive fantasies that dominate cinemas and the small screen. We cheer as buildings crumble and innocent lives are inevitably upended or lost. A comical one-liner from an attractive protagonist is all it takes to make us forget the carnage. In the Marvel movies, some effort has been made to find a moral and ethical balance. And the DC cinematic universe infuses their narratives with brooding angst that lingers throughout. But “Uncharted” is all about the gold. Sure, there’s a murky story about Drake’s brother, but everything is played on the surface. And it’s that superficial tone that proves to be “Uncharted’s” undoing. The body count is high, but the film cuts away before revealing any gruesome images. One character’s throat is brutally cut with barely a drop of blood. It’s frustrating as the character lies lifeless with only a thin red line on this neck. I wondered if an effect was missing. Sure, the idea here is to appeal to a broad spectrum of viewers, many of whom are young. But the video game that this project is based on is nearly fifteen years old. The expected audience should be mature enough to handle some measure of convincing bloodshed. Director Ruben Fleischer (see his gloriously gory “Zombieland”) exhibits an overly restrained hand. But the lack of graphic violence doesn’t insulate the film from a potentially corruptive influence on younger viewers. The ultimate takeaway from “Uncharted” is that being a thief is cool and might even be a career choice. And in this growth industry, there’s honor among thieves, but the pursuit of gold is a higher good, even if that means destroying priceless relics and offing hordes of fellow pursuers in the process. Remember that Indiana Jones sought to preserve ancient treasures and history, not convert them to his personal benefit. The real thieves were the Nazis, right? Sure, I understand that Drake is on the hunt not necessarily for the riches but to find his lost brother. However, these potentially wholesome motivations are confused as the frantic action takes over. The camaraderie between stars Wahlberg and Holland does work to some degree in “Uncharted.” They would be perfect in a remake of 1988’s Tom Cruise/Bryan Brown drama “Cocktail.” In early sequences, Holland is entertaining as he mixes drinks and cracks wise behind the bar. This vibe continues as Chloe becomes a part of their team. Unfortunately, “Uncharted” isn’t that movie. Any box office success of “Uncharted” will be forged on the back of Holland’s boyish charm and growing, outsized stardom. However, for this potential franchise to continue something more than Holland’s magnetism is required. And the project’s moral conundrums will need to be reconciled in a way that brings balance to this absurd video game-inspired narrative.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," The film adaptation of Uncharted, the action adventure video game franchise, has been a long time coming. Development was started in 2008, shortly after the first game in the series came out. It went through numerous directors, stars, and release dates in its road to completion, something that as a film you generally want to avoid. In the meantime, three sequels and multiple spin-offs to the first game came out, raising the franchise to a high level of respect and fandom. So now that the film finally came out, why does it feel so much like an obligatory adaptation to an anonymous video game? And why does it feel like figuring out the answer to that question would have made a more interesting movie than the one we ended up with? The film centers around Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), a young pickpocket and would-be explorer who teams up with Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to discover a lost cache of gold from Ferdinand Magellan’s attempt to sail around the world. It’s the same thing Nathan’s brother Sam was trying to find when he disappeared years earlier. Teaming up with fellow tomb raider Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), our…heroes…race to discover the gold against treasure hunter Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his brutal enforcer Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle).  Uncharted is a pretty boilerplate video game movie from start to finish. It doesn’t really do anything to elevate itself or attempt anything new with the format. It has a sort of Resident Evil thing going for itself, throwing elements of the games into the film to tick the right boxes but without trying to stay terribly loyal to the games themselves. The plot is meant to be a prequel to the games, but it contradicts so much of the series canon that it’s incompatible as a prequel. At the same time, it only does enough of its own world-building to make its thin plot work, making the whole thing seem rather inconsequential and airless. Unlike the Resident Evil films, though, Uncharted as a movie lacks a truly captivating protagonist to make up for that lack of setting and context. Say what you want about Alice, but Milla Jovovich at least makes the RE films fun to watch. Tom Holland is inherently charming, and the extra muscle he packed on for the film looks absolutely delicious (especially in jeans). But there is just nothing terribly interesting about the film’s Nathan Drake as written. His tragic backstory isn’t explored enough to make it compelling, and his motivations seem to shift with the scene. Holland does what he can here, and it should be noted that he’s the only member of the cast with any emotional range at all, but it’s not enough. Nearly everybody else in the cast gives an entirely one-note performance, especially Mark Wahlberg. Oddly enough, he was originally meant to play Nathan when the film was first announced back in 2008. As Sully, he’s present. He took the cash, he cashed the check. He reads his lines well, but he doesn’t seem invested in doing anything with the character. That goes double for Antonio Banderas, who coasts by entirely on his natural charisma and a low, slightly gravely line delivery that lets you know immediately that Moncada is dangerous. Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle fare a little bit better,  but both are still trying to desperately make characters out of nothing. And in Garbielle’s case, she only comes off as more dynamic because of Jo’s signature weapon, a wicked-looking kerambit.  There’s a distinct lack of chemistry between most of the characters, and at times it feels like they’re all acting in different films and were composited into scenes together later. It’s especially noteworthy between Holland and Wahlberg, with Holland clearly doing the heavy lifting between the two. His rapport with Ali is slightly better, if only because Ali seems to be at least a little invested. Every character is betrayed by someone else at least once over the course of the film, and it never once feels shocking, unexpected, or dramatic. That just feels like a big problem. Most of the blame, however, has to rest squarely at the feet of the creative team. The cast, regardless of their levels of investment, are just reacting to the material they’re given after all. The script is relatively straightforward, with little complexity or wit. The opening scenes from Nathan’s childhood are pretty clunky and full of “as you know” dialogue. In some ways, it might be the most video game moment of the film because it feels very much like a prologue cut scene that you can’t skip over, no matter how many new game pluses you start. It’s clearly meant to have some heavy emotional weight, as it details the relationship between Nathan and Sam, but whatever theoretical impact it was meant to have just doesn’t show up on screen. Director Ruben Fleischer also doesn’t bring a tremendous amount of personality or verve to the film, either. It doesn’t have any of the cheeky subversiveness of Zombieland or even any of the cheesy retrofied vibe of Venom. He does handle the action scenes fairly well, and they’re at least moderately exciting with a mild degree of inventiveness. The film opens in media res with Nathan clinging to life on a series of cargo crates dangling out of a plane while being attacked by Moncada’s forces. The danger is genuine even if the physics are questionable, and it’s one of the few times the film comes close to evoking the excitement of the games. The climactic battle takes place between two 16th-century sailing ships that are being airlifted by helicopters over the coast of the Philippines, and it gets a lot of points for concept if not for execution. The choreography is a little muddy, but it succeeds if only for the audacity of the setup. Despite all this, the film isn’t an awful slog. It is at least 15 minutes too long, sure, but it’s not as tedious as it might have otherwise been. A lot — and I do mean A LOT — of that comes down to Tom Holland’s inherent likeability and his commitment to the physical (if not narrative) aspects of his character. Even if his Nathan Drake seems bit like a slightly more felonious and swear-ready Peter Parker (are far younger than Nathan was ever meant to be), it’s a role he fills very well. If he’d had a script up to his level, the film could have been something at least close to dynamic.  As it is, it’s just another video game movie, albeit one with grand ambitions that it never really comes close to achieving. It aims high, but it settles low, and the result comes off as fairly anonymous. Sometimes, it feels like a standard adventure film that had the Uncharted IP slapped on it at the last minute. The series deserves better, as does Tom Holland and Nathan Drake both. It might not be a terrible way to spend two hours; just don’t expect to make any new discoveries.  Daphne: Fred, why do ghosts and monsters and stuff turn up wherever we go? Is it something about us?Fred: No, this happens to everyone.Daphne: What? Fred: It would be just too much of a coincidence if this only happened to us. So, logically, everyone must run into ghosts and monsters all the time. Daphne: Really?Fred: Sure. It’s simple math. They must be everywhere.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 18, 2022"," It’s one of the problems of movie stardom in this superhero-driven era we live in. You’re an actor who wasn’t a star before playing a Marvel or DC hero — Chris Hemsworth, say, with Thor; or Gal Gadot, with Wonder Woman — how do you extend the brand? Not the superhero’s — yours. In olden days, meaning before the late Stan Lee started his cameo career, stars tried to avoid typecasting. Now it’s comic-book casting. Tom Holland, whose excellence as Spider-Man has done so much to make that franchise reboot a success, takes on the challenge in “Uncharted.” He plays Nathan Drake, a 25-year-old bartender in New York. Nate comes naturally by his longstanding interest in old maps and exploration, being a descendant of Sir Francis Drake. “At least that’s what mom and dad used to say,” his older brother tells him. Nate’s also quite the talented pickpocket. These seemingly unrelated areas of expertise come in handy when he’s sought out by Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a former Navy helicopter pilot now in hot pursuit of a hoard of gold supposedly acquired, and lost, during the voyage of Ferdinand Magellan, in the early 16th century. “In today’s dollars, 5 billion, easy,” Sully estimates. Does that description sound vaguely familiar? “Uncharted” is based on a popular video game. It has a lot in common with the “National Treasure” pictures, from the early ‘00s. And one of Wahlberg’s best movies (”Three Kings,” 1999) has him playing a character involved with a very different hoard of gold. You will not be surprised to learn that Nate and Sully have company in going for the gold. A Spanish kajillionaire named Santiago Moncada considers the hoard family property, since the Moncadas helped underwrite Magellan’s expedition. Inevitably, he is played by Antonio Banderas. Just as inevitably, Banderas is very good. Moncada is assisted, and then some, by a deadlier-than-the-male henchwoman (Tati Gabrielle, who’s OK). Also in on the chase is a former associate of Sully’s (Sophia Ali, who’s not). The hunt takes some or all of these individuals from New York to Barcelona to a resort in the Philippines. There’s even a flashback to Boston, where Nate and his brother were raised in an orphanage — and first acquired a taste for larceny (in Boston, that is, not the orphanage). Along the way, there are at least three double-crosses; two actual crosses, both made of gold; one vintage red Mercedes coupe; two 16th-century Spanish carracks; a very fancy auction (it’s the most entertaining sequence in the movie); a highly bravura midair action set piece that’s so casually ridiculous it almost seems ho-hum — almost. It figures prominently in the TV ads. Also, not to get too far ahead of things, the movie has not one but two Easter eggs. Holland is personable and boyish beneath his years. Sound familiar? He gets to do lots of Spidey-ish things: leaping and jumping and sliding and swinging. Sound even more familiar? The brand isn’t so much getting extended as repurposed. Wahlberg has the good grace to let Holland dominate things. As a character, Sully sits somewhere between (much) older brother and raffish uncle. The back-and-forth between the two characters isn’t bad. “Uncharted” is big on isn’t-badness. Quite competently done (Ruben Fleischer, “Zombieland,” is the director), it’s mostly diverting, but not especially inspired. In a movie whose stock in trade is inventiveness, it’s never an encouraging sign when the inventiveness seems mechanical. “Uncharted” feels like a movie where six writers had a hand in the script — three for each Easter egg? — and that’s only the ones with an actual screen credit. A good comp wouldn’t be the “National Treasure” movies, which have a real buoyancy and sense of momentum, but “Red Notice.” That’s the action movie from last fall on Netflix that was a bit of attempted brand extension for Gadot. In fairness to Holland, “Uncharted” works better for him than “Red Notice” does for her. Maybe the most useful way to understand “Uncharted” is with that Mercedes in mind. That’s not because it’s the best-looking onscreen vehicle this side of the orange Saab 900 in “Drive My Car,” though it is. It’s because “Uncharted” is like a well-tooled sportscar with an underpowered engine. The car does keep going, but not at high speed. Vroom . . . vroom? Vroom . . . sputter. Brand extension is one thing. Horsepower addition is another. Directed by Ruben Fleischer. Written by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, Mark D.

"Feb 18, 2022"," It's easy to be dubious of a video game movie adaptation, considering their shaky history. But Uncharted is alright. It's far from perfect, but still a good time at the movies with Tom Holland. The Spider-Man: No Way Home actor stars as Nathan Drake, the treasure-hunter-with-a-heart-of-gold, who leads the PlayStation video game series, on which the movie is based. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (of Zombieland fame), this adaptation stands on its own as an origin story for our pal Nate.  Rather than pulling from any one game, Uncharted draws inspiration from a series that was itself inspired by the likes of Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones. Holland's Nate is a bartending, smooth-talking history nerd, who supplements his income by conning customers out of their valuables. We learn early on that the source of Nate's penchant for criminal mischief is his long-absent brother Sam, who — after being expelled from the boarding school the Drake both boys attended — disappeared into the wider world. It's not long before Nate meets Victor Sullivan aka Sully. Mark Wahlberg may not be the most welcome presence on screen, but he initially seems well-cast as an untrustworthy grifter, who always comes off like he's playing an angle. Nate even calls him out at one point, angrily declaring something like, ""Stop figuring out the lie you're about to tell and just give me the truth!"" Sully has a job for Nate, a real big-money situation that he can't pull off on his own. The two are total strangers, but Sully has some history with Nate's brother. And the job he's planning — which Sam was set to help with before he disappeared — is really just one step toward a much larger reward: A lost gold hoard that once belonged to the 16th-century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his ship crew. There's nothing particularly surprising or original about the unfolding story in Uncharted. You'll see most of the double-crosses coming, either because they're telegraphed or simply as something you know in your gut because that's how movies like this work. An array of flashy action set pieces mix in with all of that. Even if you know how they're going to go in the end, they still make for a fun watch. There's one stretch through the catacombs beneath Venice that's reminiscent of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Another sequence cuts closer to the physics-demolishing chases that you'd see in a Fast and Furious movie. And of course, there's the cargo plane set piece we've all seen in trailers. This one is so intense that Uncharted double-dips, using a small slice of it for the movie's cold open before revealing everything with proper context later. In all this, there are brief flashes of a movie that distinguishes itself from the general landscape of action-fueled blockbuster entertainment. Nate's borderline-superhuman agility and knack for free climbing — which are major elements in the game series — is a slickly shot highlight of every set piece, with Holland's Spidey stunt training no doubt coming in handy as he stylishly leaps, slides, and engages in fisticuffs.  Holland is the strongest piece of Uncharted. His action-hero moments, which feel more like a nod to Jackie Chan's slapstick acrobatics than Marvel's high-flying wall-crawler, are only a piece of that. Nate likes a good wisecrack as much as any version of Peter Parker. But he's also an adult who has Been Through Stuff, and he acts like it. He's a little out of his element alongside veteran Sully. Yet he's far from the wholesome high schooler he's played in the Marvel movies. It's impossible to avoid making that comparison. Spider-Man: No Way Home is still doing great in theaters as Uncharted arrives. For fans of both, the dissonance between the two characters is unmistakable. Nonetheless, Holland is a magnetic presence. He's clearly not the same as the game character the role is based on, but he gleefully picks up the Indiana Jones torch and runs with it. I had no choice but to shout myself hoarse after he asks in a playful nod, ""Nuns. Why does it always gotta be nuns?"" It's a hilarious tongue-in-cheek twist, but also reflects how deep-seated and vaguely irrational fears haunt both men. As for Wahlberg, he is kinda just... there. His character's video game counterpart is a cigar-chomping conman who definitely loves Nate, but just as definitely loves himself and his personal enrichment far more. He's double-crossed his supposed friend more than once while still somehow always coming through in the end. We don't really like or trust him even as we see his lovable qualities. Exactly half of that is true for Wahlberg's take. Movie Sully is an unrepentant conman and serial liar, and he's very upfront about it in a way that's abrasive. There's nothing lovable about him. Maybe that's because Uncharted is giving us the origin of his relationship with Nate, but it's not just that. Wahlberg's performance is also short on personality. Sully arrives as a one-dimensional character, who never really grows beyond the template that Wahlberg seems to have copied/pasted from his role in the Will Ferrell comedy, The Other Guys. The further we dig into the cast, the lighter their characterizations get. The three would-be antagonists in Santiago Moncada, Braddock, and Chloe Frazer are all just different foils for Nate. Moncada (Antonio Banderas) is the mastermind, just out of reach and filled with schemes. Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) is the source of moment-to-moment tension as she and her flunkies hunt for and repeatedly scrap with Nate. And Frazer (Sophia Ali) is something akin to a femme fatale — less deadly by design. But just like Sully, she's driven most of all by a desire for financial self-enrichment. She's also the biggest disappointment.  Uncharted is a fine but flawed first step for what Sony no doubt hopes will be a new blockbuster franchise. But the game series it draws from is so much more than Nate, Sully, and set pieces. Frazer is a big part of that ""so much more,"" as a recurring character and regular presence in Nate's life. (She even starred in her own excellent spin-off game.) Uncharted sets up some of those pieces. But like everyone not named Nathan Drake, we never spend enough time with her to get more than a surface impression. That's a bad call on the filmmakers' part. The Uncharted games carefully sidestep most opportunities to reinforce toxic masculinity, but it's still a series that's led primarily by a white guy and his white guy partner in history crimes. As game developer Naughty Dog has matured over the years, that balance has shifted to give women and people of color both more prominent roles. So it's baffling that an Uncharted movie released in 2022 would short-change everyone after its lead white guy. Exposition and character development are clearly sacrificed at the altar of making a gripping blockbuster roller coaster ride. So, we're left with yet another video game movie adaptation that's a poor reflection of its sensational source material. Sure, Uncharted is filled with entertaining and visually dazzling moments. Holland steps out of his Spidey spandex and capably demonstrates his leading man action-hero chops. I'd love to spend more time watching this character get up to all kinds of treasure-hunting mischief.

"Feb 18, 2022"," One of the thrills of movies is the adrenaline rush that comes when an action flick spins your head around with jaw-dropping stunts. Though a shaky script doesn't get in the way, ""Uncharted"" -- in theaters for President's Day weekend -- adds up to a fun ride. Its rocket fuel is Tom Holland, 25, whose ""Spider Man: No Way Home"" is now the third-highest grossing film of all time and still climbing. It's nifty to buddy him up with Mark Wahlberg, 50, who survived two ""Transformers"" epics without losing his sense of mischief. Don't worry too much that ""Uncharted"" is adapted from a video game, a junk source for the tacky likes of ""Mortal Kombat"" and ""Resident Evil."" The film version finds its inspiration, not from PlayStation, but from such film blockbusters as ""Indiana Jones"" and ""National Treasure."" The British Holland plays Nate Drake, a New York bartender/pickpocket eager to join Wahlberg's Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan to tomb raid a church in Barcelona and run off with $5 billion worth of buried gold left behind five centuries ago by famed explorer Ferdinand Magellan. That's a cue for ""Zombieland"" director Ruben Fleischer to kick the heroics into high gear. But not before some backstory. Nate grew up in the St. Francis Boys Orphanage with his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), who went missing. Do you think Sam will show up again? You bet. And will Sully, with a suspicious past, have anything to do with it? Right again. Plot complexity is not a strong suit with ""Uncharted. But action is. Whether Nate is falling out of a plane, dodging booby traps, deciphering maps or matching wits and fists around the globe with rival scavenger Santiago Moncada—Antonio Banderas in villain mode—he's in it to win it. So is Moncada, who figures he's got dibs since his family financed Magellan in the 16th century. Women also figure in the farce, notably Sully's friend Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) and Moncada martial arts ally Jo Braddock (a terrific Tati Gabrielle), but the flirty entanglements stay PG-13. ""Uncharted"" is a bromance with snappy twists coming every time the ladies outsmart the guys. It helps that ""Uncharted"" is one of the better video games, a huge success that sparked three sequels and a prequel. The game has been around so long that Wahlberg was earlier meant to play Nate. Spotting Sully in a tux, Nate sasses, ""pretty old for prom, aren't you?"" Burn. There's a reason ""Uncharted"" is still a better video game than a movie, even with a $125 million budget and two stars going mano-a-mano. The you-are-there participation in a game is impossible to reproduce on screen, where filmmakers call the shots, not gamers. Still, ""Uncharted"" is far more watchable than it has any right to be and it gets better as it goes along, which almost never happens. The final sequence in which pirate ships are hurled into the air for a battle royale is eye-popping spectacle with nothing to apologize for. The final credits point to ""Uncharted"" as the start of a new film franchise with Holland as a Zoomer version of Indiana Jones. That's a big fedora to fill. And Holland and director Fleischer are leagues away from the whip-cracking wonders achieved by Harrison Ford and Steven Spielberg. But don't count out Holland's star power. He's unstoppable.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," There are a handful of watchable video game movies (the new Tomb Raider comes to mind, as does Paul W.S. Anderson’s initial Resident Evil). Some of them even approach a certain kind of goodness: I will defend Christophe Gans’s 2006 adaptation of Silent Hill, which uses set design, creepy fog, and genuinely terrifying character design to drape an oppressive blanket of dread over the proceedings. Helpfully, unlike most such films, Silent Hill had a very good cast: Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean, and Alice Krige are no slouches. Unfortunately, most video game movies are more like the original Tomb Raider starring Angelina Jolie or the sequel to Silent Hill (which is, I’m not exaggerating, one of the ten worst movies I’ve ever seen) or almost any of the Resident Evilfilms after the first one (excepting the third, which takes place in the wastes of Vegas and hits just the right mix of absurd action and video game homages). While I appreciate the efforts to rehabilitate the absolutely dreadful Super Mario Bros., Bob Hoskins was correct to remember it as his biggest mistake and greatest regret. The point of this preamble is to say that I’m not opposed to the idea that a video game could make a great movie. After all, for many years no one thought a comic book could make a great movie, and now we only make movies out of comics as best as I can tell. I’m just saying: the evidence shows it’s very hard to make a good video game movie, let alone a great one. Which brings me to Uncharted, which is based on the series of games that began with Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune. This is the sort of game series that feels particularly suited for adaptation to film: It is cinematic in the sense that it features exotic locations, it has action that’s well suited for both exciting stunts and entertaining gunplay, and it’s got a storyline that could’ve fit in with the adventures of Indiana Jones. The team assembled for this picture looks, on paper, to have been adequate to the task. Director Ruben Fleischer’s work on the Zombieland films has been well received (though, for the record, I’m not really a fan). The cast is very solid: Tom Holland (playing Nathan Drake), Mark Wahlberg (playing Nathan’s mentor, Sully), and Antonio Banderas (playing the scion of the Spanish Moncada family hoping to track down billions in gold stolen from his ancestors centuries ago) all have decent track records, while Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle add some femininity and edginess to the proceedings. But the final product feels a little paint-by-numbers. From the in medias res action-packed opening to the flashback to Drake’s childhood where we learn some of his backstory and the backstory of the quest at hand (something about Magellan and gold, that’s all you really need to know) to the fetch quest that teams Drake, Sully, and Chloe Frazer (Ali) to the puzzle-based search through the tunnels of Barcelona to the double- and triple-crosses by Mancado and henchwoman Braddock (Gabrielle) to the final big set piece involving flying pirate ships (just roll with it), you can feel the script (credited to three distinct teams comprising five writers) working through the motions as the film plays out in front of you. This is not to say that the picture is aggressively bad (it’s very competently done!) or that say there aren’t some funny bits (Sully gets a cat! Scottish accents are hard to understand!). But the whole thing is just kind of … dull. Tom Holland plays Drake like Peter Parkour,* hopping around and over and through various obstacles like he’s been pulled directly out of a film from 12 or so years ago. He’s done no favors by the part; there’s just a charisma mismatch when Holland is asked to play a young, wide-eyed Drake squaring off against and trying to stare down Banderas in the film’s opening act. I will say that Uncharted doesn’t fall into the video game adaptation trap of feeling like a video game brought to life (see, e.g., the first-person sequence in Dwayne Johnson’s Doom). It just feels like a somewhat generic action movie. And that’s progress of a sort, I suppose. *I will not be googling this phrase to see how many tens of thousands of people have already used it; it’s my joke, you must pay me royalties to use it.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," If you were not already aware, you won’t be too far into the big-screen adaptation of one of Playstation’s largest video games before you notice the obvious connections to the godfather of modern adventure, Indiana Jones. Thankfully, as the games so often did, the film adaptation of Uncharted honors its ancestors as well, even if a bit on the nose with that line. But the real question is this: does the movie respect the series it takes its own name from? In this origin story, Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is an orphan who is separated from his brother, Sam, as a child due to a poorly conceived breaking-and-entering job. On this job, we learn of the Drake brothers’ fascination with a treasure amassed by Ferdinand Magellan and lost to the world by the House of Moncada. While Nathan continues to receive postcards from Sam throughout his life, he never sees him again. Fast forward to the present day, and Nate is now a bartender with sticky fingers and a few too many viewings of Cocktail under his belt. One night, a “random” encounter with a slyly manipulative treasure hunter named Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) convinces Nathan to give up his life as a bottle-slinger and get into the treasure game… and possibly find his brother Sam as well. Along for the ride is fellow treasure seeker Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, pitch-perfect casting), badass assassin with a bitchin’ stylist Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), and Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a maniacal narcissist who believes these riches are his family’s legacy. As far as casting goes, Uncharted is stacked in names with genuine talent. If you have played the Uncharted games (which I have, repeatedly), then you probably have had a tinge of trepidation this entire time as you awaited to see if Tom Holland could possibly capture the screen presence of the sarcastic rapscallion and historian adventurer that IS Nathan Drake. In the games, Nathan is basically Bradley Cooper with a shoulder holster (or Nathan Fillion if you really want to get serious). Tom Holland has evolved into a very good Spider-Man, but Nathan Drake? Here’s the good with the bad for game fans: Tom Holland pulls off the role with aplomb, he is also not the Nathan Drake you know. Not yet. But by the end, he has edged much closer to the Nate that fans love. It is also an odd choice to create an origin story with new elements, yet borrow heavily from action set-pieces found in the games that technically occur later in the series (an entire airplane sequence from the film is directly lifted from Uncharted 3). Still, this team makes it work. For movie fans who prefer to get outside a bit more than me and have never touched the games, you’ll be quite content. Tom Holland nicely rises to the occasion to elevate his blockbuster stature with a role that affords him more opportunities for gunfights and quite a bit of exciting parkour. There is an emerging confidence to Holland’s portrayal that inspires excitement for what the future of this potential franchise might hold. Mark Wahlberg is Mark Wahlberg. That’s a good thing if you’re a Wahlberg fan (I am), not as great if you’re a Sully fan (I also am). It’s a situation of we have to just let those things go that we WANT and enjoy the movie as its presented. Wahlberg’s Sully is a confidence man who lives almost distinctively by his lack of code, and Nathan’s brash earnestness might just be the thing that jolts his moral compass to life. Nate and Sully onscreen share an easy chemistry that could have easily been exploited into an even stronger back-and-forth dynamic. With a bit sharper writing in the witty retort department, future sequels could really capitalize on the charm at hand with Holland and Wahlberg in the cockpit. Director Ruben Fleischer is a filmmaker who knows how to make the ridiculous and outlandish “fun” (Venom, Zombieland), and Uncharted is no exception. This is a rollicking adventure that I can easily see as one you will frequently re-watch while channel surfing. Set-pieces are engaging and thrilling, with at least one genuinely surprising twist. For a sprawling, worldwide adventure though, the cinematography never quite POPS to open the film up to an Indiana Jones-level. As well as the action occasionally suffers from quick cuts and extreme editing, but the potential is there for something great down the road. If a future installment is greenlit, I would happily jump onboard. After all, in the game world Uncharted 2 was an incredible leap in quality from Uncharted 1. Uncharted is not exactly what gamers wanted, but it also does not completely miss the mark. There is enough respect for the video games here to know they care about the fans. For general audiences who just wanted another Indiana Jones-esque treasure romp, you’re in for a rollicking thrill ride with a cast of charmers led by Holland and Wahlberg. By the time the end credits tease the next adventure, you’ll be ready to chart another course.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," Wondering if Uncharted is ok for kids? Rated PG-13 for language and violence, Uncharted is not kid friendly for all ages. However, with Tom Holland’s popularity right now after Spider-Man: No Way Home, many tweens and teens will want to watch this video game adaptation that is a bit meh. Here’s what parents need to know in this Uncharted Parents Guide.  Street-smart and smart-a** thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to recover a fortune lost by Ferdinand Magellan 500 years ago. It starts as a heist job, but then becomes a race to reach the lucrative prize and treasure before the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) gets to it. Moncada believes his family are the rightful heirs. There is quite a bit of profanity and language in Uncharted including at least 20-ish uses of sh*t, 3 uses of a**, bit*h, and damn, bastard, and words of Deity. Violence is PG-13 level in Uncharted with a lot of fighting and uses of weapons like guns, swords, and knives. A man’s throat is slit and you can see some blood. Uncharted is an action-adventure that may have too much action for younger kids. There’s nothing super over the top,  so tweens and teens can watch it as long as parents are ok with the violence and profanity. Uncharted is entertaining enough, but there’s nothing new here.  Uncharted is based on the PlayStation video game, but instead of having an original script for the film, it felt like a knockoff of several movies. I got Indiana Jones, Goonies, Pirates of the Caribbean, and National Treasure vibes, but all those movies were way better, so I’m not sure what will draw people to the theater besides Tom Holland and boredom.  Is it fun-ish? Sure. There’s plenty of fan service and enough to keep people entertained. I would have liked more backstory and character development. If you’re a Tom Holland fan, then you may be satisfied, but even all his and Mark Wahlberg’s star power couldn’t save the film for me. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," One of the first things that caught my attention during the press screening of Uncharted was the PlayStation Productions logo in the opening credits. Not just a mere logo but rather a 20-second animation, complete with some of PlayStation’s famous video game characters’ appearances. It sure looks cool, particularly if you are a fan of PlayStation games. Uncharted also turns out to be the first film released under the PlayStation Productions banner, which was formed in 2019. But despite making history and such, the big-screen adaptation of Naughty Dog’s popular action-adventure video game series of the same name is nothing more than a mediocre knockoff of Indiana Jones and National Treasure. Positioned as a feature-length prequel to the video game series, the film focuses on the younger version of Nathan ‘Nate’ Drake (Tom Holland), who is yet the famous treasure hunter that we know of. We first saw him working as a bartender and knows a thing or two about flair bartending as if he’s pulling Tom Cruise’s Brian Flanagan in Cocktail (1988). He happens to be a pickpocket too, making good use of his sleight-of-hand skill to steal his wealthy customer’s jewellery. Enter Sully (Mark Wahlberg), who is in the bar trying to recruit him to find the lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan centuries ago. Nate is reluctant at first but it doesn’t take long before he agrees to join him for the treasure hunt. Sully happens to know his long-lost older brother, Sam as well, who left Nate when he was just a kid. There’s a chance they might find Sam too but before that, they have to deal with various obstacles and setbacks. And this includes Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his team of mercenaries led by Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Then, there’s Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who also wanted to get her hands on the Magellan treasure. Uncharted has been a victim of development hell for over a decade when David O. Russell (yes, the same guy who gave us The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook) was first attached to direct the film. That was in 2010 and back then, Mark Wahlberg was initially cast as Nathan Drake, even though many fans prefer to see Nathan Fillion in the iconic treasure-hunter role instead. But Russell chose to drop out due to creative differences and since then, Uncharted has undergone several changes of different directors (Neil Burger, Shawn Levy and 10 Cloverfield Lane‘s Dan Trachtenberg, just to name a few), who were all attached but failed to get the film off the ground. Finally, Ruben Fleischer of Zombieland and Venom fame took over the director’s chair and he does show some technical prowess here. This can be evidently seen during the plane scene straight out from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception game, where Holland’s Nate leaps from one dangling crate to another before experiencing a freefall. It was the single best moment in the film and I get why this particular scene was heavily promoted in the trailers. The spectacular final third act is worth mentioning too, which involved helicopters carrying pirate ships attached to the cables. Too bad scenes like these are only a few and far between. Fleischer did include some National Treasure-like puzzle-solving moments but his overall execution feels like it’s a walk in the park. And it doesn’t help either when the stakes are surprisingly low most of the time. But the biggest problem of all has to be the film’s decision to venture into the prequel territory rather than adapting one of the stories from the video games. Sure, there are a few nods from the video game series, namely the aforementioned Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception and Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. And yet, there aren’t enough to overcome the bland origin-story approach of introducing a younger Nathan Drake. This, of course, brings me to the controversial casting decision of Tom Holland playing the role. It’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’m watching him acting all witty and boyishly reckless like Peter Parker in Spider-Man: No Way Home, which was only released two months ago in December last year. He sure handles the physically-demanding moments well enough, given his experience in Spider-Man films. His buddy-movie chemistry with Mark Wahlberg’s Sully, in the meantime, is a mixed bag. In terms of individual performance, Wahlberg’s largely sardonic performance feels like he’s stuck in the same old schtick that we see him too many times before in other action films. As for the rest of the supporting cast, Antonio Banderas sleepwalks throughout his antagonist role as Moncada. However, Tati Gabrielle shines as Moncada’s ruthless knife-wielding mercenary, Braddock while Sophia Ali delivers a feisty turn in her role as Chloe Frazer. Overall, it’s kind of a pity what we get here is a lukewarm action-adventure that charted off course instead of a potentially above-average effort. There are two post-credits scenes, though — both of which are hinted for the future sequel(s), provided the first Uncharted itself manages to make enough money in the box office.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 18, 2022"," Let’s start by saying that I’ve never played an Uncharted game, nor do I know anything about the lore or storylines behind the franchise. Yet adventure movies like this are exactly my thing so of course I was excited for this..hell it was even on my most anticipated list this year! Let’s be fair, no one really expected to much from this adaptation but I’m pleased to say that I absolutely loved it. This is exactly the kind of movie 10 year old me would have adored and one I still have fun with today.  Tom Holland makes for a fantastic action hero, his Nathan Drake may be younger than fans wanted but for me Holland is always a bonus. His charm and charisma onscreen works wonders alongside Mark Wahlberg, a Sully people will be rather mixed on but worked well enough for me, Sophia Ali, an accomplice that’s a tad to predictable and the two villains Tati Gabrielle and Antonio Banderas, the latter who’s sadly wasted within.  Nevertheless, I had an absolute blast with this film. Uncharted is at its best when it embraces the potential to be silly and spectacular. The auction scene is fun, plane scene gripping and the ‘flying’ ships scene, as shown in the trailer, is an absolute delight. The film holds so many enjoyable moments that it’s easy to overlook just how predictable it is and how shoddy the dialogue can be, and that’s exactly what I did, succeeding in doing exactly what it sets out to do, create a fun popcorn blockbuster.  It was always going to be a herculean task to adapt Uncharted to the big screen but for me it worked, setting a solid foundation for a new adventure franchise that has all the elements we look for in the genre while also having two stars that may not be the Nate and Sully people had in their heads, but ultimately do a rather great job and could easily get there with time.  Sony is hopefully on to a winner here, and for good reason: Uncharted is a well-known IP and has one of the biggest, brightest and best young stars on the planet at it’s forefront, not to mention it’s under the safe guidance of Ruben Fleischer, a filmmaker who has made three of their biggest films of the last two decades.  It’s easy to see why many will disregard it but for me, and I’m sure many others around the world, Uncharted proved to be a great time at the movies, a film I had fun with every step of the way and one I can’t wait to watch again.

"Feb 18, 2022"," UNCHARTED **1/2 (116 minutes) M
There are some ripping, screen-filling visual effect sequences in Uncharted, all of them taking place in the air at altitudes high and low. All up, that’s 15 minutes of the film. Maybe. The rest of Uncharted, sad to say, unspools as generic, stamped out, follow-the-clues action mulch directed without much style and topped off by two A-list stars who apparently forgot to bring their A-game. To say that there are no performances to speak of from Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg might be a bit rough, but it is accurate. For the most part the pair engage in a barking match that goes on for the entire film. There’s certainly no chemistry per se, and there’s no rapport because the exposition-heavy dialogue is so forced and forgettable. Story-wise, what have we got? Holland plays Nate, a bartending shyster who is approached by wily adventurer Sully (Wahlberg) to help find a couple of old sailing ships that are stuffed with gold. Along for the ride is sexy rival Chloe (Sophia Ali, from India Sweets and Spices) while chasing them is the sexier villainess Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), who does a great job continuing the tradition of action-movie equality for badass women, something we saw in Die Hard 4.0. In other words, when toasting time comes, there’s no special consideration based on gender. So the film deserves credit for that.  Yet here, for all the money hosed into the production, there’s a surprising lack of zest, even an uncertainty about tone, going from  National Treasure to Fast & Furious in the blink of an edit. It’s films such as Uncharted that make you realize just how long a shadow is cast by Indiana Jones. As Raiders demonstrated so brilliantly some 40 years ago, being derivative isn’t the issue, it’s the joy of being derivative that should be celebrated.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," A film over a decade in the making – it even played a role in the now-infamous Sony e-mail hack of 2014 – Uncharted, based on the Sony Playstation game series, has weathered the storm of multiple production woes and a global pandemic to finally unleash itself on the big screen.  Movies based on video games seldom have a good track record with their dedicated fanbase (just ask Super Mario Bros. and Assassin’s Creed) and, I suspect, Uncharted is likely to earn the same discourse. I only say that as someone mildly aware of the games and conversing with those intricately familiar with their narrative and game-play.  I, personally, have never played the games, so I’m coming into Ruben Fleischer’s actioner free from expectation and comparison, and solely judging it on its merits as a big screen genre piece that breaks no mould within its field but manages to entertain with its familiar premise. Favouring star power over deep-seated backstory, Uncharted places Mark Wahlberg and Tom Holland front and centre, with both actors playing to their signature personas in a manner that barely fleshes out their respective characters; cocky, ill-tempered Victor “Sully” Sullivan and the physically plucky Nathan Drake.  After being separated from his brother at their childhood orphanage, treasure-seeking Drake has grown up lifting jewellery from wealthy clientele, something he’s able to do in subtle frequency during his moonlighting gig as a flare bartender.  After witnessing his grifts first-hand, Sully, barely introducing himself, offers Drake the type of life-changing score that only exist in outlandish film scripts, telling him of his friendship with his brother and that in Drake retracing his steps comes ancient spoils. Throughout the course of the film’s 116 minutes, we witness the expected banter and should-I-or-shouldn’t-I trust-the-other temperament that leads the duo on various hunts across the globe.  And because there’s always a girl involved in such an adventure, Sully and Drake have to contend with both Chloe (Sophia Ali, sprouting what is assumed to be an Australian accent but barely holding it throughout), a contact of Sully’s who is all too aware that he shouldn’t be taken at face value, and Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, stealing the film from the entire cast combined), an impossibly glamorous villain whose connection with Moncada (a surprisingly underutilised Antonio Banderas), a fellow treasure hunter, consistently keeps her dangerously close to all three. Much like any of the Indiana Jones films, the Tomb Raider series, or the duo of National Treasure offerings, it isn’t so much about the final destination that we ultimately care about – it’s a given that they’ll always find the macguffin they’re after – it’s about the journey, the inherent fun there is to be had in uncovering hidden-in-plain-sight clues along the way.  Uncharted‘s story is one that breaks no new ground, and it seems in many ways screenwriters Rafe Lee Judkins (TV’s The Wheel of Time), Art Marcum (Iron Man) and Matt Holloway (Men In Black: International) were aware of this, allowing the film to hang together off the back-and-forth between Wahlberg and Holland, something that suitably lands. Of course being an action film means there has to be just that – action.  And knowing that audiences are now all too ready to accept gravity-defying, belief-suspended set-pieces, Fleischer has crafted some ridiculously entertaining spectacles within that more than owe their execution to the gradual insanity of the Fast & Furious series; the climactic sequence which features pirate ships being carried over oceans and throughout island structures by attached helicopters is truly a wild ride. Though there’s the occasional fan-service moment, most of Uncharted succeeds as being its own product, something that’s truly surprising when it comes to the realms of the video game feature.  The wheel is in no danger of being reinvented, and, again, this feels like a product designed to appeal to the masses rather than specific game players, but as a film coming out the other end of both a pandemic and over a decade of production woes, you could do a lot worse.  Yes, you could do better, but as a YA-adjacent Dan Brown-inspired affair, Uncharted tracks enough ground to keep us on Wahlberg and Holland’s tail.",POSITIVE

        The Automat, directed by Lisa Hurwitz, charts the rise and fall of the Horn & Hardart Automat in the US. The first Automat opened in Philadelphia in 1902 and then expanded a decade later to New York City. Hurwitz interviews with a wide range of people, such as Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Colin Powell, Elliott Gould, Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks, who fondly recall their memories of the Automat. If you're too young to have heard of or experienced the Automat, Mel Brooks describes it vividly with great attention to detail. He even remembers what the lady who exchanged a dollar for nickels there was like. There are even some amusing anecdotes. You'll learn about the origins of the Automat and what makes it so significant. RBG hits the nail on the head when she describes it as a place where people from all walks of life could come together, regardless of religion, race and even class. It was a melting pot that represented democracy at its finest. Howard Schultz, former CEO of Starbucks, talks about how the Automat influenced Starbucks. The food and drinks were served quickly at cheap prices without wait service. Their delicious coffee cost only a nickel. Eventually that changed, though, as Horn & Hardart tried to expand and had to raise their prices. Coffee suddenly cost 10 cents instead of 5 cents. As prices went up, demand went down and it never went back to normal after that. Hurwitz doesn't focus too much on the Automat's downfall, but she doesn't gloss over it either. She also interviews Paul Hardart, the great-grandson of Frank Hardart, one of the founders of Horn & Hardart. Clips from black-and-white movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood featuring the Automat help to bring it to life while showing how it became part of the cultural zeitgeist back then.         The Automat serves as an insightful, moving and nostalgic trip down memory lane that sheds light iconic landmark while also serving as a bittersweet reminder that every beginning has an end. Nothing that seems too good to be true lasts forever, but the memories are there and can now be shared with future generations thanks to The Automat. By the end of this enormously entertaining, delightful and illuminating doc, which clocks just 1 hour and 19 minutes, there's no doubt that there's nothing quite like the Automat today.

  A Banquet  Directed by Ruth Paxton
    
         Betsey (Jessica Alexander), a teenager, lives with her widowed mother, Holly (Sienna Guillory), and younger sister, Isabelle (Ruby Stokes). After a night of partying, Betsey experiences something strange in the woods and no longer behaves the same way that she did before. She suddenly stops eating without losing any weight. Her mother prepares plenty of meals for her and even asks her to just eat a few peas at the dinner table, but she refuses to. Meanwhile, her grandmother, June (Lindsay Duncan), visits and tries to convince Betsey that she's faking a physical illness for attention and is mentally ill.         A Banquet is a slow-burning psychological horror film. The screenplay by Justin Bull doesn't offer easy answers as it lets the audience decide if Betsey's illness has a supernatural element to it or not. He uses exposition very carefully without revealing too much too soon. Even what exactly happened to Betsey in the woods remains a mystery, but what's clear is that she's not the same after that point. The relationship between her and her mother also changes. Who's the real villain? That's not very clear. Holly shows signs that she's not a great parent by invalidating her daughter's feelings and lashing out at her, but she's justifiably frustrated. When June shows up, that's when the film becomes more interesting because you learn about Holly's relationship with her mother and something that her mother tried to cover up. Without using flashbacks, director Ruth Paxton and screenwriter Justin Bill provide the audience with a little backstory that explains some of what's going on with Betsey, but not everything. Perhaps A Banquet is really about a dysfunctional family that harbors dark secrets from their past which threaten to break the family apart. What Betsey experiences can be taken literally or figuratively. Even the third act that adds another layer of complexity leaves some room for interpretation without over-explaining or trying to be too subversive like in the painfully lazy film The Turning. Compared to The Turning, A Banquet is a masterpiece. It's not as scary or brilliant as Rosemary's Baby nor does it get as grim or twisted as Hereditary, but it comes close.          On an aesthetic level, A Banquet excels with visual poetry that combines lighting, color, editing and camera angles that add both style and substance. The images of the food that Holly serves Betsey look quite creepy and disgusting. This isn't a foodie movie at all despite all the food that's shown. The terrific sound design and visual effects are also worth mentioning, but keep in mind that A Banquet does not rely on those elements to entertain the audience. Nor does it rely on jump scares either which is quite refreshing. The performances are all solid, with Lindsay Duncan adding plenty of gravitas while making the most out of her supporting role. At a running time of 1 hour and 37 minutes, A Banquet is a poetic, gripping and creepy slice of psychological horror. It would make for a good double feature with Relic.
        The Automat serves as an insightful, moving and nostalgic trip down memory lane that sheds light iconic landmark while also serving as a bittersweet reminder that every beginning has an end. Nothing that seems too good to be true lasts forever, but the memories are there and can now be shared with future generations thanks to The Automat. By the end of this enormously entertaining, delightful and illuminating doc, which clocks just 1 hour and 19 minutes, there's no doubt that there's nothing quite like the Automat today.

  A Banquet  Directed by Ruth Paxton
    
         Betsey (Jessica Alexander), a teenager, lives with her widowed mother, Holly (Sienna Guillory), and younger sister, Isabelle (Ruby Stokes). After a night of partying, Betsey experiences something strange in the woods and no longer behaves the same way that she did before. She suddenly stops eating without losing any weight. Her mother prepares plenty of meals for her and even asks her to just eat a few peas at the dinner table, but she refuses to. Meanwhile, her grandmother, June (Lindsay Duncan), visits and tries to convince Betsey that she's faking a physical illness for attention and is mentally ill.         A Banquet is a slow-burning psychological horror film. The screenplay by Justin Bull doesn't offer easy answers as it lets the audience decide if Betsey's illness has a supernatural element to it or not. He uses exposition very carefully without revealing too much too soon. Even what exactly happened to Betsey in the woods remains a mystery, but what's clear is that she's not the same after that point. The relationship between her and her mother also changes. Who's the real villain? That's not very clear. Holly shows signs that she's not a great parent by invalidating her daughter's feelings and lashing out at her, but she's justifiably frustrated. When June shows up, that's when the film becomes more interesting because you learn about Holly's relationship with her mother and something that her mother tried to cover up. Without using flashbacks, director Ruth Paxton and screenwriter Justin Bill provide the audience with a little backstory that explains some of what's going on with Betsey, but not everything.

        In the later 19th Century, John (Boyd Holbrook), a pathologist, arrives at a small village to investigate strange attacks by a creature that terrorizes the villagers. The creature bites Edward (Max Mackintosh), the young son of Seamus (Alistair Petrie) and Isabelle (Kelly Reilly). Edward immediately becomes very ill before he vanishes into the woods.         Writer/director Sean Ellis has woven a compelling narrative that combines horror, mystery, action and drama very effectively. He doesn't begin the film by jumping right into the meat of the story, but instead starts with a prologue set during World War I that throws the audience right into a battle with no exposition. That opening scene might be confusing at first because of that lack of exposition, but patient audiences will be rewarded because it becomes clearer and  more significant later on, especially a silver bullet that a doctor extracts from a soldier's body. Then the film flashes back a few decades to the story of John, Seamus, Isabelle and Edward in the village. Isabelle has scars on her back which were most likely caused by the creature that terrorizes the village. What's the creature? Why does it terrorize the village? What happens to the victims after the creature bites them? What happened to Edward? Writer/director Sean Ellis takes his time to answer those questions so, again, he trusts the audience's patience.         Fortunately, he maintains a foreboding and grim tone without veering into uneven territory with outrageous humor (I'm looking at you, Lamb) or relying heavily on gore instead of a compelling story (I'm looking at you Antlers) or showing too much of the creature itself without leaving room for the audience's imagination (I'm looking at you again, Antlers. The Cursed could've easily become repetitive, dull and/or shallow with a less intelligent, sensitive screenplay, but the screenplay always adds new layers of complexities and revelations to the story as it progresses that make it increasingly intriguing. It even has a few scary scenes while it also relies on the audience's imagination which leads to even more genuinely palpable scares. Concurrently, Ellis keeps the film emotionally resonating because he treats the characters like human beings while grounding the film even further in realism.         The cinematography, set design and lighting as well as the landscape come together to create a film rich in atmosphere which helps to set the tone and to create an immersive experience. The DP, fortunately, doesn't shake the camera to create tension and grasps that the tension comes from the story itself, so the camera doesn't need to be shaken to generate tension. This isn't The Blair Witch Project, after all. The pace moves slow, but not too slow like in The VVitch or in the overrated Midsommar. A huge part of what helps to set the tone and to keep the film engrossing as well is the talented cast, particularly Boyd Holbrook who's quite charismatic and the underrated Kelly Reilly who gives an emotionally convincing, understated performance. At a running time of 1 hour and 53 minutes, which is just the right length, The Cursed manages to be genuinely scary, engrossing and captivating.

"Feb 18, 2022","The writing and dialogue are largely uninspired, and the action looks choppy and dull. Uncharted does not have the secret sauce to pull off a strong video game-to-movie adaptation.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," Then again, it's just as likely his management team sat him down and told him he can't be the Spider-Man guy forever and if he doesn't kick-start another franchise soon then his days of fancy Hollywood premieres will be over. Remember that guy who played Captain America? Not any more you don't.  Just look at co-star Mark Wahlberg, who well within living memory was the biggest box office draw on the planet (and was originally cast in the lead here a decade ago) but now seems lucky to be a sidekick in a video game adaptation where his character largely vanishes from screen every time there's an action sequence. It's a weird choice for him, as he's never given off the kind of ""lovable rogue"" vibes this role requires: you can easily imagine him cheating you and ripping you off, just not the ""ha ha, only kidding"" part. The story here is yet another Hollywood treasure quest complete with clues and death traps and codes and maps, none of which make a lick of sense on any level. Seriously, if you want to get any enjoyment out of this film at all do not spend a single second thinking about any of the puzzles; as you might expect, this is a problem for the movie as a whole. Holland is Nathan Drake, orphan turned bartender and pickpocket, who a): gets a lot of mysterious postcards from his runaway older brother Sam, who shared his obsession with the past and pirates and treasure and so on, and b): has Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Wahlberg) turn up at his bar one evening in a way that might make you think he's really Sam but no, he's a completely unrelated treasure hunter who wants Nathan's help and figures negging him like it was still 2014 is the way to get it. All you really need to know from there is that Nathan gets into a lot of (not bad) action scenes that require him to be very flexible, there's a running joke about his old cigarette lighter (that doesn't light) that never pays off, and the hunt requires them to go to all the usual locations - you know, fancy auction house, catacombs under a European city, the jungle primeval. Also, you can't trust anyone when it comes to treasure - including seemingly helpful Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), seemingly unhelpful Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), and rival treasure seeker Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas). And that all-action flash-forward scene the film opens with? That's about as good as it gets. Holland is the real draw here and he gives it all he's got, providing a charming, relentlessly likable performance that's easily the best thing about this film (and the only reason to wish for a sequel). Everyone else is fully aware they're in a limp jumble of stale Hollywood adventure cliches; he's the one taking it all seriously, presumably because this is his big chance to show he can make bank out of a Spider-Man costume.  Or any costume really. If it's surprising how often he either ends up in a soaking wet top or entirely shirtless, that's only because Marvel movies are so remorselessly sexless even the slightest reminder that Holland is a movie star - and those guys are traditionally meant to be objects of desire - now seems more startling than any rusty death trap.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022"," Someday, someone will make a really good movie adaptation of a video game. It has to happen, eventually, right? “Uncharted,” based on the PlayStation title, is the latest attempt. It’s an adventure yarn in the mold of Indiana Jones that has a likable cast, spectacular production values and plenty of over-the-top action. If it only had a brain. Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are thieves following cryptic clues in search of Magellan’s lost fortune. Despite its title, “Uncharted” covers territory that many better films have explored many times before. File the movie “Dog” under “pleasant surprises.” Channing Tatum stars in this entertaining and engaging buddy road movie which he also co-directed. Tatum plays an Army Ranger suffering from combat head injuries who experiences some misadventures when he’s assigned to transport a military working dog to its handler’s funeral. He reluctantly takes the assignment in hopes that his superior officer will reward him with a choice position. “Dog” has more depth than one might expect and is clear-eyed about depicting some of the difficulties that returning veterans experience. Smart, funny, and touching, this “Dog” has a surprisingly high pedigree. The very, VERY adult Norwegian comic drama “The Worst Person in the World” is one of the best movies now in theaters, an Oscar nominee for this year’s Best International Feature. Renate Reinsve is compelling as an aimless young woman who can’t quite get a grip on either her love life or career goals. Writer/director Joachim Trier employs cinematic tricks that might seem gimmicky in lesser hands, but they all seem to work, here. “The Worst Person in the World” is a witty, thoughtful, and relatable portrait of a fickle Millennial.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 18, 2022", This movie worked - mainly due to how charismatic and talented Tom Holland is in the role of Nathan Drake. It's a fun watch with great action sequences. Worth checking out whether you're a fan of the game or not. ,POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2022"," It’s a unique sensation when one person can be easily singled out of a group or project as the issue. It doesn’t necessarily mean that the person is bad on their own — merely that they are not in harmony with the others, whether it’s an inferior drummer in a stellar rock band, a mediocre outfielder on an all-star baseball team or a particular performer in a movie/TV show who sticks out like a sore thumb. Mark Wahlberg isn’t the only problem with “Uncharted,” but, given the importance of his role and the amount of screen time that he has, it is the most pronounced and frustrating of the bunch. The other detrimental aspects certainly hinder Ruben Fleischer’s film from being as great as it could be, but most could be forgiven, as they are offset by some fun sequences and lots of charm from Tom Holland and the rest of the cast. If “Uncharted” does become a movie franchise (as its two post-credit scenes set up), this Wahlberg conundrum can hopefully be resolved in some form to allow for a cinematic experience free from so many lulls and missteps. Nathan Drake (Holland) is recruited by Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Wahlberg) to help find the lost treasure that Ferdinand Magellan’s ships were reportedly carrying before they disappeared. Nathan is brought in because he’s an expert in history and exploration like his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow). Sam has been absent from Nathan’s life for decades, and now it appears that he’s missing completely after accompanying Sully on these adventures. Nathan, with his quick thinking and nimble athleticism, joins Sully on a race across the globe to locate the gold and hopefully some answers as well. This quest brings them into the sights of Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), an obscenely wealthy man who is obsessed with reclaiming the riches that he believes are owed to him as a descendant of the mariners. Moncada has employed a ruthless mercenary named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) to help unearth the treasure and kill anyone who gets in the way. Wading into all of this is Chloe (Sophia Ali), another adventurer/thief who forces Nathan to realize that no one can be trusted — not even Sully. “Uncharted” is based on the very successful video game series of the same name. However, there’s no need to be familiar with the game to enjoy any aspect of the film outside of a few nods (like a cameo by the game’s lead voice actor Nolan North or a joke about Sully growing a mustache). These minor bits of fan service feel forced and are probably recognizable as such even to people who don’t know exactly what’s going on in the moment. It’s a detail that honestly doesn’t come up often but represents an ongoing pattern in “Uncharted” where most sequences, storylines and performances are 90% fully formed but then have a weird gaffe here and there. Holland occasionally slips into a broad New Yawk accent before going back to his usual American patois, and many of his reactions to the crazy events surrounding him use a lot of the same verbal tics from the Spider-Man films. Additionally, while most of the chase sequences are impressive (with Holland seemingly doing many of his own stunts) and use the surroundings in fun ways, there are some action scenes where the cinematography and editing are too chaotic, which is not the norm for accomplished DP Chung-hoon Chung (“The Handmaiden,” “Last Night in Soho”) and editors Chris Lebenzon (“Top Gun”) and Richard Pearson (“Quantum of Solace”). These flawed set pieces are further marred by sloppy CG that makes it look closer to a video game cutscene than the exciting action beats that occur on physical sets. Besides these minor intrusions, “Uncharted” offers some legitimately fun character interactions and banter, especially between Holland and Ali. The screenplay creates a Nathan Drake who wants to believe in people being better than they are but isn’t completely naïve to their manipulations and lies, either. Gabrielle is also a terrific heavy whose sultry energy allows for a serpentine approach as she dispatches anyone who gets in her way, while Banderas is very much in Bond villain mode, complete with grandiose monologues. Make no mistake, none of this is meant to be gritty or mired in our reality. Instead, the characters’ relationships and reactions find their grounding in the swashbuckling spirit of the Indiana Jones films. And then there’s Mark Wahlberg. Putting aside the fact that he is miscast given the character in the games, he simply can’t pull off someone who knows a lot about archeology or who’s canny enough to double-cross so many people. His usual line delivery becomes increasingly pronounced as the film plays, and he exudes little to no charm with Holland. There are two highlights involving one truly funny joke (on purpose, no less) and an inadvertently hilarious sequence where, separated from Holland and Ali, he spends about two minutes constantly asking, “What’s going on? What’s happening?” without any change in wording, pitch or any other modicum of acting. Per his role in this film (not to mention the games), Sully should be someone that audiences don’t really trust but can’t help but like due to his natural warmth, humor and sardonic ways. Wahlberg lacks all of those qualities in this movie. Fleischer’s film is certainly flawed in ways that go beyond the co-founder of Wahlburgers. Whether it was due to a restrictive budget or schedule, there are elements that should have been easily recognized and then slightly revised to lessen their distracting natures. But apart from these unrefined missteps, “Uncharted” is a fun movie centered on a charismatic lead with enjoyable set pieces and engaging relationships. Invoking Indiana Jones in multiple ways doesn’t help with the comparison, but it’s certainly better than a vast majority of archeological adventures and a pleasant way to spend a few hours. There’s true gold within “Uncharted,” and hopefully the filmmakers will be able to extract and polish it off for any future endeavors in the series. You can find our full content archive

"Feb 18, 2022"," Chicago - Here’s the assorted loot you’ll find in the treasure chest of ""Uncharted"": Two slam-bang action setpieces, some lackluster plotting, a charming leading man turn from Tom Holland, an ensemble of wasted supporting players and a woefully miscast Mark Wahlberg. Does that add up to a hidden treasure or a disappointing haul? Well, that lies in the eyes of the fortune hunter.  ""Uncharted"" isn’t bad enough to be a bad movie, but not good enough to be a good one either. And for a highly anticipated video game adaptation that’s been in development for over 12 years (long enough for Wahlberg to have originally been cast as the young upstart rather than the mentor), that makes its long-awaited arrival a bit of an anticlimax.  For better or for worse, what ""Uncharted"" does succeed at is evoking other, more accomplished action-adventure movies. This is Bond meets ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""Tomb Raider"" meets ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" all heavily filtered through the history-based comedic banter of the ""National Treasure"" franchise. There’s even a touch of the Tom Cruise classic ""Cocktail"" in there too. When we first meet Holland’s Nate Drake, he’s a full-time bartender, part-time pickpocket with charisma to spare. Soon enough, however, his small-scale crimes get a big-scale upgrade when he’s roped into a global-hopping adventure alongside Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Wahlberg), a selfish fortune hunter on a quest to find Magellan’s lost gold. There’s ostensibly a personal connection at play too. The heart of the film hinges on Nate’s long-lost older brother Sam, who instilled a love of treasure hunting in his kid sibling before disappearing in the wind for 15 years. Sully claims he was friends with Sam and can help Nate find him if they locate the gold. But in a cutthroat world where everyone is just out for themselves, does Sully actually see Nate as a true teammate or just a pawn to be used?  Of course, it’s hard to imagine anyone on Earth heading to see an ""Uncharted"" movie primarily for its emotional character drama, which is good because there isn’t really any — at least not any that’s successful. In what could be a fun role for a game, grizzled actor, Wahlberg comes across more as one of the villain’s lunkheaded goons than a smart, self-possessed treasure hunter steeped in 16th century Spanish history. It’s as if the producers never told him whether he was filming a swashbuckling adventure, another ""Transformers"" movie or ""Ted 3,"" so he just decided to lean into his usual comedic schtick to be safe. And while the film does sort of try to lampshade what an odd fit Wahlberg is for this world, that mostly just leads to cringe-worthy comedy masquerading as banter.  Holland, thankfully, fares a bit better — and not just because his ""Spider-Man"" training comes in handy for Nate’s parkour fighting style. Though this younger, origin story take on Nathan Drake might not entirely fit the vibe of the hit PlayStation video game series (this reviewer hasn’t played it), Holland succeeds at aging up his Peter Parker persona without diminishing its appeal. This version of Nate is a confident charmer who’s also just a little less cool than he thinks he is, a choice that underlines the lighthearted tone of the whole project. Holland is an actor with major ""kid brother"" energy, and ""Uncharted"" wisely leans into that even as Holland tries to launch himself as a bulked-up adult leading man. Still, that’s not always enough to carry the movie in the (brief) stretches of downtime between its action scenes. The treasure hunting/heist plotting is about half as clever as it should be. And supporting players Sophia Ali (as reluctant ally treasure hunter Chloe Frazer) and Tati Gabrielle (as a sexy femme fatale mercenary enemy) are underserved by the material — although not as much as Antonio Banderas, who seems to have spent no more than two days filming his role as the film’s aristocratic big bad.  Yet just when ""Uncharted"" starts to become a slog, it throws in an action sequence that perks things up considerably. Yes, a lot of these setpieces come from the video game, and, yes, most of them have been spoiled by the film’s trailers. But for pure, dumb ""turn off your brain and enjoy"" fun, ""Uncharted"" has something to offer – particularly when it takes to the sky for its two biggest showstoppers. While one offers a demented sky-set riff on ""Frogger,"" the other evokes ""Peter Pan"" in a wonderfully unexpected way. In an era where giant apes and massive superhero battles regularly fill our screens, it’s easy to take this kind of CGI spectacle for granted. But in its best moments, ""Uncharted"" succeeds at conjuring a sense of awe and creativity, if not exactly originality.  The film’s goofy, playful sense of self-awareness also works better in its action moments than its purely comedic ones. There’s winking fun to a climax that’s half helicopter chase, half old-fashioned swashbuckling swordfight, as old and new combine in a way that feels distinct to this world.  ""Uncharted"" isn’t great cinema. It’s not even great action-adventure cinema. But if there are better ways to spend two hours, well, there are worse ones too.

"Feb 17, 2022",Fans of the games are likely in for a disappointing time (though may at least be inspired to re-play the series). Mild hope remains for those seeing it without expectations. Sadly no matter what it won't be an adventure film that stands the test of time. ,NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2022",These characters are not Nathan Drake and Sully. This is Mark Wahlberg and Peter Parker.,NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2022"," By definition movies made from video games are heavy on
action and short of virtually anything else. 
What makes some more tolerable than others is the likability of the
leads and the quality of the special effects. 
On those admittedly low standards, “Uncharted” succeeds better than
most. The script is based on the Naughty Dog PlayStation game
that debuted in 2007 and has been going strong ever since, emitting various
media offshoots.  The protagonist is
Nathan Drake, a treasure hunter searching for places and objects of historical
and monetary value.  The other main
characters are Drake’s comrade/mentor Victor Sullivan, reporter Elena Fisher
and fellow hunter Chloe Frazer.  In this
origins-episode outing penned by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway,
all but Fisher are included in the plot, with a few new figures added; the
scenario is “original,” so to speak—i.e., not directly taken from the games,
though the premise is. Nathan is introduced as a young orphan, played by Tiernan
Jones, who’s in the same Catholic facility as his older brother Sam (Rudy
Pankow).  They’re a troublesome pair,
caught one night after they’ve broken into a museum to investigate a map that
supposedly offers a clue about the lost treasure of Spanish explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who led the first circumnavigation of the earth.  Sam, unwilling to be sent to jail, escapes
into the night, leaving Nathan to grow up alone in every sense. Nathan turns into Tom Holland, working as a bartender in
a trendy NYC joint (Holland swipes some of Tom Cruise’s “Cocktail” moves) but
engaging in pickpocketing on the side. 
He’s approached by Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a more established scalawag,
who says he worked with the long-absent Sam in the past and enlists Nathan in a
mission to find the Magellan lode using the very map that entranced the boy and
his brother so long ago. With that the movie is off and running, and it’s lucky to
have Holland to do the heavy lifting in the action department; Wahlberg, whose
Sullivan proves an unreliable ally in any event, gets involved in the fights
and chases from time to time, but is more likely to be standing off to the
side, scowling as his younger colleague engages in amusingly perilous battles
and engaging in mildly snarky banter in the intervening dialogue sequences. In one Nathan dangles—again—from a bunch of tubular
fixtures as he tries to escape some burly guards at a plush auction house.  He’s there because he and Sullivan are trying
to purloin a sixteenth-century golden, bejeweled cross that’s one of two “keys”
to finding the treasure before it’s purchased by their chief adversary Santiago
Moncada (Antonio Banderas, who would be twirling his moustache if he had one),
a ruthless Spanish tycoon who would do anything—even eliminating members of his
own family—that might stand in the way of his finding the loot.  Moncada also has a fearsome helper in Jo
Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), a woman with a penchant for using knives in combat,
one of whose beefy aides is a burly Scotsman (Stephen Waddington) with a brogue
so thick it’s virtually impenetrable. The fourth major player is Frazer (Sophia Ali), another
treasure-hunter, who happens to possess the second cross and becomes an
off-and-on ally and rival in the search. 
Nathan engages with her in a breathless chase through Barcelona’s
tourist sites, a dangerous investigation of the underground chambers of one of
the city’s churches, and that flamboyant plane sequence, which also involves a
falling car.  She’s absent, though, in
the over-the-top climax, when Nathan and Sullivan have to face off against
Braddock and her minions at the end of the search, a cave where a couple of
Magellan’s dilapidated vessels, their holds crammed with gold, are found.  Helicopters are also enlisted in an action
explosion in which Sullivan’s trustworthiness gets the ultimate test. Holland’s real co-stars, though, are the crafts team, who
bring off the big action sequences with panache: kudos to cinematographer Chung-hoon
Chung, production designer Shepherd Frankel, editors Chris Lebenzon and Richard
Pearson, the huge effects team and the army of stuntmen and stuntwomen. Nor
should one forget the contribution of director Ruben Fleischer, who fortunately
brings his better half to the proceedings: 
here he’s more in the exuberant mode of his “Zombieland” movies than his
deplorable “Venom” ones.  Ramin Djawadi’s
score, meanwhile, gives a familiar boost to the frantic business. “Uncharted” is, of course, patent nonsense, and one needn’t bother trying to follow the clues that lead the hunters to their destination; in the games they might be important, but here they’re just obligatory window dressing.  But the ridiculousness is made more palatable by Holland’s engaging star turn and the expertise of the effects team, in whose hands the absurdity of the action set-pieces proves more exhilarating than exhausting.  It’s no wonder that the makers possess the confidence to add two Marvel style, sequel-promising clips to the end credits; this may in fact be the start of another tent-pole series for Holland.

"Feb 17, 2022"," A lone treasure hunter, outwardly cynical yet containing an optimist within–insofar as a belief that finding objects from the past can lead to fortune and glory–is a well established archetype at this point. Crystalized in Raiders of the Lost Ark and brought to video games via Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider series. Later on, Uncharted would bring some new gameplay elements and a focus on realistic graphics when the series debuted in 2007. A feature film adaptation has been in development almost as long, and now that the series has arrived on screen, it feels like most of the franchise’s appeal was lost along the way.  What made The Da Vinci Code such a runaway success was its incorporation of well-known art and history into its thriller narrative. For National Treasure, it leaned into Nicolas Cage’s manic energy, embracing the absurdity of buried treasure in an age of Google Earth. Both of them have main characters that border on smug, but are also scrambling and out of their respective elements when the guns start showing up. In its video game form, Uncharted has never shied away from mass murder, but the games also do their best to develop its main cast of characters over the course of each game to make them feel distinct. It’s solid action-adventure storytelling, nothing groundbreaking for the genre, but well done in my experience. Had I never played any of the series, this live action version wouldn’t make me seek them out. Instead, I would likely dismiss them as looking fun, but shallow.  Uncharted the movie decides it needs to be an origin story for Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), which is a fine choice, but the actual construction of his origin story feels cobbled together and not coherent. His motivations are kind of redundant, and he too often feels like a passive protagonist in his own story. Not helping matters is Mark Wahlberg, the film’s biggest weak point. I’m not a Wahlberg hater, I’ve seen the 2003 Italian Job at least 25 times, but he is totally miscast as Sully. The character is written to be selfish and duplicative, but Wahlberg’s performance never feels like a charmer. The chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg is a big step down from Holland’s work with Robert Downey, Jr., who actually would have been more fitting in the role. Antonio Banderas is also wasted in maybe the least interesting character he has ever portrayed on screen. The big bright spot in the film’s cast is Sophia Ali as Chloe. Ali brings a lot of fun, and works better with both Holland and Wahlberg than they do with each other. She is tragically sidelined in the third act, which is simply frustrating.  The action in the film is sparser than anticipated due to its video game origins. But what is here is competent enough. With a few exceptions, it’s easy to follow, but it lacks any sort of flair beyond the cargo airdrop featured in the trailers. For a franchise that emphasizes perspective and surprising sequences, this incarnation feels like it was assembled by a committee so worried about trying to feel like a real movie that they cut out any sense of flair or distinctness. It’s not that it’s bad, especially if you catch it on cable on a sleepy afternoon. But there’s so much wasted potential lurking behind every poorly-realized puzzle here. There’s just enough of a glimpse of what could be to make this totally fine movie a disappointment. Just go back and revisit The Rundown instead.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Like in the game, the movie takes place in a world where people have few scruples and angle after ill-gotten gains (in this case, a missing treasure). Never considers what the Spanish treasure ship and the explorers who crewed it did to the land and people they plundered, nor whether finding and keeping the gold is worth the toll it ultimately takes. Central character Nate is intended to be seen as principled compared to his fellow adventurers, who don't hesitate to double-cross each other. And he is indeed loyal to those he considers his friends, but he also kills dozens in his pursuit of wealth and never seems to question it. Sully and Chloe are even less principled, betraying each other at almost every turn, as well as killing conveniently anonymous villains. The two top-billed stars are White men. Within the central quintet of tough, brave characters, two are young women of color; everyone else is male. An antagonist is a man of unspecified Latino heritage who frequently speaks Spanish. Female characters are sexualized with bare, clingy costumes. Frequent action violence, with many set pieces in which the main characters must fight their way into or out of situations. Characters are often in mortal danger -- e.g., a scene in which they're trapped in an underground chamber filling with water. Two people are accidentally ejected from an aircraft and fall through the air while taking out villains. Deaths take place on-screen, including scenes in which throats are slit, characters are stabbed, and people fall off of planes and helicopters; blood is infrequent, and only one dead body is visible at length. Guns are used/brandished. Most of the opposition that main characters face is of the anonymous-henchperson type, with assailants seen quickly and dehumanized by shots that hide their faces. Flirting. A male character looks suggestively at a woman's body as she walks away; he's warned off by another character. References to characters being ""together,"" and a scene in which characters are seen asleep in bed with the implication that they slept together. Female characters, particularly one antagonist, wear costumes that are impractically tight and bare; male characters are frequently seen shirtless. Language and cursing includes ""s--t,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""bastards,"" ""ass,"" ""crap,"" ""oh my God,"" and ""Jesus"" (as an exclamation). Characters frequently say something ""sucks."" Several scenes take place at bars, with characters ordering cocktails by name (martini, negroni) and a bartender showily twirling bottles. In another scene, characters bond by drinking wine; by night's end, all look bleary and exhausted, and the room is littered with perhaps 10 bottles (for three people). A character holds, but does not smoke, a cigarette. Parents need to know that Uncharted is a treasure hunt action-adventure movie that's based on the popular video game series featuring hero Nathan Drake (Tom Holland). Expect lots of largely bloodless action violence, much of it in the form of set pieces in which the main characters have to fight faceless, dehumanized minions to get into or out of a location. Characters are frequently in mortal danger, including dangling from a flying plane and being trapped in an underground cavern that's filling with water. Guns are used, and people are killed by being hurled off of vehicles and falling great distances; one has his throat slit, and viewers see some blood and his dead body. Sexual content is limited to flirting, suggestive looks, and a scene that shows people in bed, implying that they slept together. While two of the main characters are women who are depicted as just as strong and brave as the men, they also wear clingy and sometimes unrealistically bare costumes that would be difficult to fight in, including spiked heels. Language includes ""s--t,"" ""son of a bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""oh my God,"" and more. Characters drink frequently; in one scene, three people share at least 10 bottles of wine and appear bleary and sloppy afterward. One character holds a cigarette and tries to light it but doesn't succeed. Drake is depicted as more heroic than the other characters because he doesn't betray his fellow adventurers, yet, like them, he pursues the lost Spanish gold at seemingly any cost, without concern for death and injury.

Based on the popular action-adventure video game series that started with Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, UNCHARTED focuses on the game's main protagonist: treasure hunter Nathan Drake (Tom Holland). Claiming that he and his long-lost brother, Sam (played as a teen by Rudy Pankow), are descended from renowned explorer Sir Francis Drake, Nathan is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to search for the lost riches of Ferdinand Magellan, with the grudging accompaniment of their associate Chloe (Sophia Ali). But they aren't the only team on the hunt: Nathan and Sully's globe-trotting forays are closely followed by the ruthless and well-funded Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his hired gun, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Beautiful to look at and crammed with heart-stopping adventure sequences set in picturesque foreign lands, this video game adaptation is thrilling, if overly long and morally iffy. What Uncharted mainly has going for it is adept adventure set piece directing and star Holland, who's an affable, even charming, lead. Nate is relatably anxious in the midst of mortal danger yet both game and good-humored, a fantastic foil for Wahlberg's Sully, who leans toward blank-faced derring-do. Holland's easygoing vibe makes viewers want to root for Nate on his quest in beautiful places and through immeasurable danger. But that quest is more enjoyable if you switch off your brain before watching. It can't be denied that the only difference between Nate and Sully and the better-funded Moncada team that opposes them is that we're told the Moncada family is involved in criminal enterprises. Real bad stuff, the film tells us in a few throwaway lines, and then, poof!, Sully and Nate are seemingly cleared to kill as many people as they want in horrible ways in pursuit of treasure. That doesn't sound like a particularly heroic quest, but the film treats it as such (none of the characters questions whether this is a worthy goal, even when lives lost in the hunt mount into the dozens), which certainly detracts from the messages viewers might otherwise take away. Fans of the video games may not care: Scenes in which Nate and Sully leap through midair from planes and helicopters and ancient Spanish galleons are certainly exciting, and the Holland-and-Wahlberg buddy team is pleasant enough to anchor the movie if you don't think too hard about it. Families can talk about whether you need to have played any of the Uncharted games to appreciate this movie. Does knowing the game(s) help sharpen your enjoyment, or is the comparison distracting? Do video games typically make good fodder for movie adaptations? Why, or why not? Many games have lots of deadly violence, with enemies killed in great numbers as the main character pursues their goal. How does the impact of that compare to what you see here? How does Uncharted dehumanize the characters who die so that viewers don't consider their deaths important and it doesn't detract from the movie's flow? Is that OK? How do you think viewers are meant to feel about Sully and Nate? About Chloe? Braddock? How do movies tell you who to root for and who to dislike? Consider that villains and heroes in this movie use the same ends to attain their means -- i.e., physical violence and trickery. With that in mind, what makes the heroes different from the villains?

"Feb 17, 2022"," Uncharted is an adaptation of the PlayStation relic-hunting video game series in which rugged adventurer Nathan Drake and an ever-expanding cast of friends, enemies and ambiguous associates race around the world in search of hidden fortunes. Movie stars throw themselves into elaborate green-screened action sequences left and right. But the one mystery the movie never solves is: why are we watching this, exactly? In fairness, if you’ve ever wondered what a Tomb Raider movie would look like if it starred Peter Parker instead of Lara Croft, this is that picture. Tom Holland – Marvel’s current web-slinger – plays the young Nathan, a small-time hustler racing around the world in search of billions in Spanish gold while trying to figure out if he can trust his fellow fortune hunters Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) and Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) to have his back against the baddies (Antonio Banderas, Tati Gabrielle) when the time comes. Allegiances are swapped, traps are sprung, puzzles are solved, priceless artifacts are waved around like conversation pieces. There’s an impressive IMAX-scaled climax, as these things require. Uncharted ticks all the boxes, but there’s no spark of life; it’s just another generic action picture with no ambition beyond launching another franchise. Ruben Fleischer, who’s made everything from the Zombieland movies to Venom, keeps it all moving quickly enough that fans won’t care how thin the story is, or how it asks nothing from its cast – to the point that Holland gives exactly the same chatty-brainy performance he gives in the Marvel movies, just in a wet Henley instead of a Spidey suit. (Wahlberg, somehow, does even less.) Still, the gamers at my preview screening were very happy to see their favourite characters brought to life exactly the way they expected them to look, so maybe that’s all it needed to do. I just wish Uncharted had something to offer the rest of us.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 17, 2022"," I’m not even going to pretend I played the Uncharted video games. But I have enough knowledge from friends to recognize a thing or two (maybe a cameo from a voice actor?). While I won’t be making any side-by-side comparisons between the games and the new film adaptation, what I can say is the Uncharted movie is soothing, extremely watchable B-level entertainment with a dynamite pairing in Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. It’s goofy and completely nonsensical, but it’s also a funny and thrilling adventure akin to The Mummy, the Jumanji films and National Treasure. After multiple production delays due to COVID-19, the film is finally arriving in theaters and IMAX screens this weekend. From what I’ve been told, the film adaptation takes inspiration from the fourth game in the PlayStation franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End.  Directed by Venom’s Ruben Fleischer, the origin story follows the street-smart Nathan Drake (Holland) as he goes on a globe-trotting journey in a bid to find unique treasures. He’s recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (a no-mustached Mark Wahlberg) to recover a massive fortune lost 500 years ago by a world explorer. However, when an ancient key to unlocking the gold’s location hits a New York auction, the duo soon realizes they’re not the only ones searching for clues. Look out for Antonio Banderas’ ruthless Moncada, Sophia Ali’s lovely-but-questionable Chloe Frazer and Tati Gabrielle’s cutthroat mercenary character Braddock.  The movie begins in media res, opening with the film’s arguably most gripping action scene. It sees Nathan tumbling out of the back of an airplane with several cargo containers. Holland brings over some of his Spidey characteristics when he accidentally knocks a goon to their death, saying, “Oh, man. Sorry!” But don’t worry about this feeling too much like Holland being plucked from No Way Home and tossed into another IP property. Holland carries over the charm, but he’s got some solid witticisms that punch up what we’ve seen. He even learned some impressive bartender tricks for the role, so you could buy Nathan’s sly hands. It’s believable and fun to watch. As Sully, Wahlberg is a good match for Holland, giving this older brother vibe with his smug attitude. Nathan and Sully’s dynamic is one of the strongest aspects of the film, toying with our emotions as to whether we should trust them together or not. The guessing game of the relationship keeps you locked in, especially as more shady characters pop into the picture. As far as the action goes, it’s not too far off from the Fast and Furious’ ignorance of physics and logic. It’s more grounded than cars cable-flying over bridges and jetting into space, but there are plenty of moments that press on the ludicrous gas pedal. Watch characters in Uncharted swing around on light fixtures and old ropes like they have endless lives to spare (kind of like a video game), and laugh hysterically at all the technology that survives water submersion. (Maybe they got Lil Wayne to test out their earpieces with champagne?) Regardless of the action IQ, the charm and jokes of the characters butter that popcorn. Moreover, it plays nicely on the IMAX screen. You might be able to notice some green screen frames and grainy stock images (as they go from location to location). But when the arms go swinging, the guns go bang and characters parkour all over Spain, it’s a delicious spectacle in a theatrically dry season.",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Salvo en honrosas excepciones, los aficionados al mundo del videojuego solemos contar las traslaciones a la gran pantalla como tremendas decepciones, en parte, por culpa de una industria obcecada en replicar las fórmulas —y efectos sobre el jugador— originales en un medio narrativo radicalmente diferente, y mucho menos visceral e inmersivo. Es por esto que la simple idea de llevar la saga 'Uncharted' al cine me producía escalofríos.  Con la publicación del espléndido y rompedor 'El tesoro de Drake' hace ya quince años, el infalible equipo de de Naughty Dog logró acercar más que nunca cine y videojuegos —algo que iría mucho más lejos en futuras continuaciones—, exprimiendo hasta la última gota de la potencia de la PlayStation 3 y evocando el cine de aventuras de corte más clasicista a través de unos personajes tremendamente carismáticos, de un guión repleto de sorpresas y de una concepción de la acción rara vez vista con anterioridad. Todos estos elementos, sumados al insalvable diferenciador de la interactividad, convertían la adaptación de 'Uncharted' en una misión condenada, a priori, al fracaso. Pero Ruben Flesischer, plenamente consciente de la naturaleza del proyecto, ha reformulado las claves que han hecho grandes las hazañas digitales de Nathan Drake, llevándolas a su terreno y transformándolas en un blockbuster modélico, respetuoso con su fuente de inspiración y tremendamente divertido. Desde que debutó en 2007, he disfrutado plenamente de todas y cada una de las entregas de la saga 'Uncharted', he adorado a todos y cada uno de sus protagonistas y me he quedado boquiabierto en no pocas ocasiones con el pad de control entre mis manos. Guardar tanto cariño y tener tan interiorizada la obra de Amy Hennig, Neil Druckmann y compañía podría haber sido un enorme palo en la rueda a la hora de enfrentarme al título que nos ocupa, pero no ha hecho más que enriquecer una experiencia que me ha mantenido con una enorme sonrisa en la boca durante sus ajustadísimos 116 minutos de metraje. Esto ha sido, mayormente, gracias al modo en que Ruben Fleischer y su ejército de guionistas —hay nada menos que cinco acreditados— han optado por adoptar componentes de las cuatro partes jugables numeradas e integrarlos en una nueva historia que funciona a la perfección como precuela, que se presenta salpimentada con un buen puñado de easter-eggs que harán las delicias de los parroquianos, y que captura toda la esencia del trabajo de Naughty Dog. Por supuesto, esto último se consigue principalmente a través de los personajes; y pese a que sea evidente que el de Tom Holland no es el Nathan Drake poligonal interpretado por Nolan North, el británico se las ha apañado para trasladar a esta versión rejuvenecida el encanto, socarronería y nobleza tan característicos del bueno de Nate. Aunque, si alguien roba todos los focos de la función por encima de él y de un Mark Wahlberg sorprendentemente acertado como Victor Sullivan —la ausencia de bigote es lo de menos—, esa es la Chloe Frazer de Sophia Taylor Ali. En lo que respecta a su forma, 'Uncharted' cumple con todo lo que cabría esperar de una producción de 120 millones de dólares basada en una IP como esta; comenzando por una factura audiovisual apuntalada sobre la notable fotografía de Chung Chung-hoon —DOP habitual de Park Chan-wook y autor de la magnífica 'Última noche en el Soho'— y sobre la contundente banda sonora de Ramin Djawadi, que no evita que se echen de menos las partituras de Greg Edmonson, pero que viste a la perfección unas setpieces realmente espectaculares. Es, en última instancia, a través de sus dosificadas, aunque ampliamente satisfactorias, escenas de acción donde la película se aproxima más a su referente; y lo hace tanto en las ""robadas"" —brutal la reinterpretación del avión de carga de 'Uncharted 3'— como en las originales, destacando unas coreografías de lo más dinámicas y con un sentido de la cinética envidiable que reflejan en pantalla el sistema de ""suerte"" —que no de daño— de los juegos. Así da gusto ver a Drake recibir golpes de todas las formas imaginables. En la inscripción del icónico anillo que Nathan Drake lleva en su colgante puede leerse ""Sic Parvis Magna""; algo que, en español, podría traducirse como ""La grandeza nace de pequeños comienzos"". Pues bien, si esta 'Uncharted' es el ""pequeño comienzo"" de lo que, más que probablemente, derivará en una nueva franquicia, el futuro no podría ser más prometedor. Y es que, quién iba a decir que ver a Tom Holland vistiendo las pistoleras de Drake al ritmo de 'Nate's Theme' le pondría los pelos de punta a un escéptico de mi talla.",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Before Nathan Drake  was a stubbly, world-weary treasure hunter who’d raided his share of tombs and knew his way around a puzzle-heavy, peril-filled PlayStation 3 RPG, he was just another twentysomething dude in New York. You know the type: looks like a movie star, likes to flip bottles while mixing cocktails, excellent at pickpocketing and parkour, has a missing older brother and a chip on his shoulder. He’s also got a deep interest in Magellan, as so many young people do these days, as well as the rumors that the explorer stashed a heap of gold somewhere while traveling around the world. His sibling, Sam, was obsessed enough to go searching for it, in fact. But a long period of radio silence suggests that something has happened to Nathan’s kin. Then into his life walks Victor “Sully” Sullivan, a father figure who might help this orphan find his only family member. It turns out that Sully and Sam went looking for Magellan’s gold together before the latter went M.I.A.; if Nate needs to aid him in locating the loot, they can track down his brother. Their quest will be filled with allies, archnemeses, evil billionaires, double crosses, hot pursuits, some globetrotting, and a knock-down drag-out fight in a Papa John’s in Barcelona, because why not? For gamers, these names and the promise of action set pieces brimming with the mashing of triangles, squares, R1’s, Xs and Os — translation: running, jumping, parsing clues and fast-and-furious-combo fights — may be thrilling. Everybody else may simply feel a strange sense of deja vu. We’ve been here, in this extremely well-mapped-out multiplex territory, hundreds of times before. Part intellectual-property barrel-scraping, part pumped-up star vehicle and part fumbling bid for Sony to cross media-revenue streams, Uncharted isn’t the worst attempt to bring a beloved video game to the screen — just the latest bit of evidence that these things are really a zero-sum game. It does start out on a high, or more accurately, about 20,000 feet high: our young Drake (played by Tom Holland) is introduced hanging by a strap to a series of cargo boxes dangling out of an airplane. It’s one of the stand-out missions in Uncharted 3, and director Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland) stages it like he’s dropping viewers into en media res gameplay, with Holland leaping from container to container, ducking giant flying objects, avoiding bullets and thugs as he tries making it back into the holding area. It’s a lovely opening salvo of well-paced chaos, and establishes this future adventurer-to-be as someone who hasn’t quite mastered the hero gig just yet. When he finally makes it back on board, Drake is immediately hit by an unmoored sports car and tumbles right back into the clear blue sky. This is what most people would characterize as a promising start. And then…everything immediately settles into what feels like a series of exposition-heavy cut scenes, occasionally braking for manic bits of recycled derring-do, nudges and nods to die-hards and 1,001 references to other, better blockbusters. The fact that Holland is not just a newly mintable movie star but also a graceful, highly athletic one — and happens to be in another Sony-owned property at the moment — means that the company’s getting their money’s worth, and viewed from the perspective of pitching the 25-year-old as not just a superhero but a 21st century action-flick swashbuckler, this prequel to the PS3 series works better as an audition reel than a franchise starter. As for the sound and the CGI flurry surrounding Holland, he’s more or less broad-shouldering the burden of this I.P. cashgrab on his own. No longer the gray-haired, guayabera-wearing mentor from the games, the slightly younger Sully is played by Mark Wahlberg, whose demeanor is completely wrong for the part. (His entire performance can be summed up as: I’m the one trying to get rich off a lot of lost treasure. You must be the other guy.) Antonio Banderas is the de rigeur villain with an accent, and simply proves that while Spanish ham is indeed delicious, it tends to lose its flavor when lazily slapped on top of leftovers. Grey’s Anatomy‘s Sophia Ali and The 100‘s Tati Gabrielle get slotted in to the respective gorgeous companion/fellow pirate-booty hunter and gorgeous henchwoman/assassin roles. They both deserve a lot better. So do Uncharted fanatics, for that matter. Video games are an active form of entertainment. Peruse the graveyard of attempts at rejiggering canon-worthy titles for a passive medium while trying to retain what makes them great, but without just delivering live-action character cosplay, and you’ll find it’s littered with corpses. The Uncharted games were great at letting players shoot, slide, sprint and scale their way through an old-fashioned adventure movie. Something — everything — gets lost in translation here. Sony very much wants to trade on the brand recognition of a PlayStation staple. The longer you watch them put Holland through his Drake paces, however, the more you feel like they wish they could get away with calling this Tomb Raiders of the Lost National Treasure of the Caribbean, Starring Spider-Man. It’s a second-generation copy of someone else’s static-y greatest-hits compilation. You’re better off watching old walkthrough clips.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Dirección: Ruben Fleischer Reparto: Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, Sophia Ali, Antonio Banderas, Tati Gabrielle, Steven Waddington Título original: Uncharted País: Estados Unidos Año: 2022 Fecha de estreno: 11–02-2022 Género: Aventuras, Acción Guion: Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway Fotografía: hung Chung-hoon Sinopsis: El astuto ladrón Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) es reclutado por el veterano cazatesoros Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) para recuperar una gran fortuna amasada por Fernando de Magallanes hace 500 años y perdida por la Casa de Moncada. Lo que en un principio era para ambos un plan de robo, se convierte en una carrera de infarto alrededor del mundo para conseguir el botín antes de que lo haga el despiadado Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), quien afirma que él y su familia son los auténticos herederos. Si Nate y Sully consiguen descifrar las pistas y resolver uno de los misterios más antiguos del mundo, estarán en posición de encontrar el tesoro valorado en cinco mil millones de dólares y tal vez incluso el hermano de Nate desaparecido por largo tiempo...pero solo lo conseguirán si aprender a trabajar juntos. Una de las virtudes de este retorno, sin complejos, tal vez sin originalidad y sin ninguna pretensión más allá de la de (casi nada) entretener, al cine de aventuras más clásico es que no se obsesiona en ser una sucesión de guiños a los fanáticos de la serie de videojuegos de la cual toma nombre, personajes y esquema, sino que simplemente (casi nada) cuenta una de esas búsquedas del tesoro que desde Robert Louis Stevenson a Steven Spielberg han hecho soñar a generaciones. Uncharted no decepcionará tampoco a los que han pasado horas o días ante una PlayStation (y las dos escenas post créditos son para ellos en ese sentido un regalo), pero eso no es lo que los guionistas y un Ruben Fleischer cada vez más cómodo como artesano consideran su objetivo principal. Una aventura como las de antes, filmada como las de antes pero en un mundo que ya es algo sin lugares secretos, destinos exóticos y botines de conquistadores esperando ser descubiertos. Una película de aventuras como las de antes en un cine actual que ha sacrificado la capacidad de sorpresa por la aparatosidad de sus secuencias, ilustraciones aisladas sin ningún tipo de misterio. Uncharted consigue devolvernos bastante de ese misterio, esa sensación de que bajo tu ciudad (ni más ni menos aquí que Barcelona, lo que para quienes somos de allí es un placer doble que al tristemente desaparecido autor de La sombra del viento, Carlos Ruiz Zafón, le habría encantado) hay cámaras secretas, mapas en relieve, catacumbas, fuentes-trampa e iglesias con enigmas. No es algo nuevo, por supuesto (la sombra de Indiana Jones y la última cruzada es alargada), pero sí lo es la energía con la que la película nos hace creer en el oro de Magallanes y de su tripulación. Energía que no decae nunca en sus más espectaculares set pieces, la aérea y la de los helicópteros y los galeones, donde Fleischer homenajea a uno de sus referentes de culto: Remo, desarmado y peligroso (Guy Hamilton, 1985) o en las que parecen no serlo tanto, pero que resultan deliciosas (el robo en la subasta, digno de la análoga secuencia con Cary Grant en Con la muerte en los talones). Con esa evidente deuda hacia Indiana Jones (a quien se cita expresamente) o al Nicolas Cage de La búsqueda de Jon Turteltaub (otro director orgulloso de ser un artesano y no un autor) y un rechazo evidente y agradecido a las Lara Croft cinematográficas, Uncharted realmente es una historieta de Tintin (El secreto del Unicornio y El tesoro de Rackham el Rojo, no por casualidad en el argumento de la adaptación dirigida por… Steven Spielberg) ambientada en el siglo XXI, quizás en un oasis de inocente optimismo dentro de esta época pesimista que vivimos.

"Feb 17, 2022"," There's little question about Tom Holland's movie star status. Once you achieve Marvel Universe creds, then you're about as legit of a Hollywood star as you can get.  But Holland is proving himself to be more than just a dude taking his lap around the Spiderman franchise. He does big screen very well. Holland performs with unjaded fresh face appeal even if the film is old-hat lazy. Directed by Reuben Fleischer (Zombieland, Gangster Squad, Venom), Uncharted stars Holland as Nathanial ""Nate"" Drake. Nate is a street-smart (adult) orphan lured into adventure by Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), who might know something about Nate's older brother. Also, Sullivan owns an original map charting Ferdinand Magellan's pre-empted quest for gold, something that fuels Nate's curiosity before his brother abandons him with a promise to return. Within the first few moments of Uncharted, Holland has convinced me that there are no pursuits more worthwhile than the very things my mother hoped I'd avoid pursuing: life as a bartender flinging cocktails like a circus performer, a nimble pickpocket, and a fearless thief, and (topping my mother's list) being an orphan. By the time Nate and Sully meet, and the two engage in a repertoire of one-up-conmanship, I've enough invested in Nate to not be too concerned where the rest of the film will take me. I felt destined to champion Uncharted as a playful send-up of the Hollywood blockbuster. And so, I strapped myself into a story that I knew would test credibility, distract with beautiful people cleverly bantering in exotic locations, and substitute suspense with ricocheting allegiances and a PG 13 body count. For a while, I manage to cling to that commitment. But eventually, my loyalty erodes into skepticism and finally into the harsh acceptance that, in the face of blockbuster action films, Uncharted is a bust. It's not easy to admit that this raucous adventure that chases history and artifacts through catacombs, beneath churches and cities, into hidden rooms, and narrowly escaped booby traps fails. It's even harder to pinpoint why. So, perhaps it's the grand-finale Disney ride set piece? Or the connect-the-dots script that promises the world but on a flat-earther's terms? Or is it the uneasiness that comes from watching a story striving for Indiana Jones appeal but delivers National Treasure disappointment? My bias is against Uncharted for being the latest in transitions from video games to blockbuster film. Uncharted may well be an engaging game to play, but as a movie dips well beneath the watermark of the throw-back matinee actioners, it so feverishly wishes to be part of.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 17, 2022"," A black hole of charm, Sony’s Uncharted is the opposite of inspired. Everything about this lazy, expensive, haphazard adaptation of the popular Playstation exclusive reeks of assembly-line blockbuster manufacturing. For a wannabe franchise-launching starting block, one that clocks in with an aggressive $120 million dollar budget, Uncharted feels little more than a hack pastiche of adventure movie tropes, airlifted in from better treasure hunter films and spackled with a coat of snide Mark Wahlberg one-liners. It’s painful by virtue of just how adamantly risk-averse and paint-by-numbers just about everything on screen ends up being. Adapted fairly directly from the Naughty Dog game franchise that began in 2007 and has since spawned three direct sequels and a couple of spin-offs, Uncharted plays fast and loose with characterization, turning series stars Nathan Drake and Victor “Sully” Sullivan into bland action stars with little personality to call their own. From the jump, Tom Holland (Drake) and Wahlberg (Sully) seemed like questionable casting choices and, having seen the film, I can confirm that they were indeed terribly miscast for their roles. Holland brings a whiff of spark to his version of Drake but he’s such a bland actor decidedly making few actual “choices” with his take that absolutely nothing pops about the character. He reminds us of Nathan Drake because he’s clothed like the character we remember, nothing more. That said, he’s far better suited to Nathan Drake than Wahlberg is to Sully. Wahlberg misses the mark entirely. Not only does he look or sound nothing like the character, he has none of his brackish appeal and acts as a source of annoyance rather than a guiding mentor. Tom Holland does technically look the part (especially from behind) but his youthful lack of experience just don’t fit the character as experienced in the game. I’m by no means a purist when it comes to adapting a video game property into a film but having Nathan Drake be an orphan turned New York bartender/petty thief only makes sense until he suddenly knows how to drive a boat or fire a weapon with deadly accuracy. Uncharted just kind of bumbles from moment to moment, too busy with plot double crosses and cringy humor to dig into who these characters are and what makes them interesting. The beginning of Uncharted speaks to the sloppy ride in store, the film from Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Venom) starting with a flash forward then a flash back before finally settling into “Present Day”. After Nate’s older brother Sam left him in the lurch years prior, the small-time thief has been left to his own devices, lifting jewelry off patrons at the swanky NYC bar he tends to. Drake is swiftly recruited by roguish ex-Navy officer Sully to find the legendary pile of treasure left behind by Megellan, battling Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) along the way. Because treasure. Then there’s Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a completely untrustworthy ally who seemingly can’t help but double cross Drake and company every other scene. The adventure plays out predictably and features almost no single moments worthy of note. Yes, the film is based predominantly on 2016’s “Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End” game, but Uncharted has been a pretty blatant spin on Indiana Jones from the get go. The fact that Fleischer’s film fails to inject any of the definitive material that helps distinguish Unchartered as a game from those other more familiar action-adventure series speaks to its ill-conceived approach. Much like the treasure seekers at the heart of the film are motivated by the lure of riches they’ll likely never get, so too is Uncharted an insipid cash grab – and so too does it come up empty-handed.

"Feb 17, 2022"," Of all
the video games out there, the Uncharted
series might be the ones most suitable for a movie adaptationor two or three
or more, as this initial go is clearly setting up at least one sequel. For those
who don't know, the games follow the adventures of a treasure hunter through
various exotic locales and ruins of reality or legend. While
the stories are fairly typical, the characters especially the jokey, likeably
cocky, and self-aware heroand their relationships are strongly developed.
While there's a lot of exploring, there's also plenty of running, jumping,
climbing, fighting, and shooting. Some of the action setpieces in the games
often rivaled or topped whatever Hollywood blockbusters in theaters around the
same time were giving us. The
games, in other words, were already pretty ""cinematic,"" so a movie
adaptation was more or less inevitable (as well as redundant, which is an
entirely different conversation). Now, we get Uncharted,
which definitely gives us the basic structure and general outline of the source
material. The plot does exactly what it needs to do, connecting various
characters and getting them from one locale to the next, but it's not until the
third actwell past the point of when the movie should have figured it
outthat the movie starts to develop a real sense of personality. The
movie begins in the middle of one of its two over-the-top action sequences, as
our daring adventurer Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is caught to the strap of piece
of cargothat just happens to be hanging from a plane mid-flight. Everything
slows considerably and for a considerable amount of time after that tease of a
flash-forward prologue. In a flashback, we learn that, as kids, Nathan and his
older brother, both orphaned, dreamed of searching for the lost gold of
Ferdinand Magellan, until their museum burglary got the brother in trouble with
the cops, forcing him to go on the run. Fifteen
years later, Nathan works as a bartender at an upscale bar in New York City,
making some extra money by swiping valuables from his wealthy and privileged
clientele. Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) spots the young
man's talent and offers him a chance to participate in some high-stakes
thievery. When Nathan learns that the loot is a golden cross, which could be one
of the keys to finding Magellan's gold and potentially learning the fate of his
brother, he accepts the job. After
the barely successful robbery, which has Nathan joking about a goon's thick
Scottish brogue and swinging from some light fixtures, the rest the plot follows
the usual globe-trotting and puzzle-solving formula of so many similar
adventures. A trip to Barcelona sends Nathan, Sully, and fellow thief/treasure
hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) through the catacombs of a church, some hidden
tunnels beneath the city streets, and through a series of traps. All the while,
the trio are being pursued by Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), whose
ancestors funded Magellan's expedition (not to mention the Crusades, the
Inquisition, and fascism in Spain), and Sully's former accomplice-turned-foe Jo
Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). The
games got away with the familiarity, not only because of the medium's
interactive element, but also because of the characters' self-aware,
devil-may-care, and sarcastic attitude, which is present to some extent here.
Because of the setup of these characters meeting and figuring out each other for
the first time, though, much of the chemistry between Nathan and Sully is
decidedly muted. It doesn't help that both Holland, clearly trying to prove his
leading-man action hero chops, and Wahlberg, showing mumbling disinterest in the
amount of exposition his character has to spout, frequently have an air of
self-seriousness about themselves. That eventually changes, although it's not
until the movie's mid-credits scene that the characters and the actors seem to
find their rapport. The
screenplay (written by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway) often
feels as if it's simply going through the motions, hoping that a couple of jokes
might be enough distraction from just how routine the plot's clue-finding,
location-hopping, and betrayal-filled specifics actually are. It's not, and
without the sense of fun that these characters might have brought to the
material, there's little comedic weight to the occasional knowing wink at or
undermining of the clichéd mechanics here (Sully, for example, finds a
centuries-old piece of an elaborate puzzle now to be part of the décor of a
pizza joint). Throughout
the movie, we can sense what the screenwriters and director Ruben Fleischer are
attempting to do in terms of the characters and the humor. It only starts to
click, though, during the extended climax, which is an admirably goofy and
rather clever sequence that has masted ships engaging in a sea battleonly
flying high above the water (The overblown spectacle of it is enough that one
might wish the makers of the games had thought of it first). Even if Uncharted
doesn't live up to its own potential, it does leave us with a little hope by the
end for what could come next.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 17, 2022"," At least give Sony credit for recycling. That is the best that can be said for its nitwit treasure-hunt movie “Uncharted,” an amalgam of clichés that were already past their sell-by date when Nicolas Cage plundered the box office in Disney’s “National Treasure” series. Now, it is Tom Holland’s turn to cash in with a musty story about ancient loot, old maps, lost ships, invisible ink and a wealthy scoundrel with disposable minions. But while he’s following in Cage’s inimitable footsteps, Holland also seems in training to become Tom Cruise 2.0. The similarities between “Uncharted” and the first “National Treasure” are notable, with both movies adhering to the same booty-questing template. Each opens with a flashback of the protagonist as a wee lad eagerly being primed for adventure by an older male relative, a misty rite of passage that seems calculated to put a family-friendly stamp on an otherwise greed-driven setup. In “National Treasure,” the kid soon becomes a character played by Cage, whose singular, offbeat performance style can elevate and disrupt crummy material. In “Uncharted,” the boy grows up to become a neo-buccaneer played by the boyish Holland, a likable, exuberantly physical performer who has traded his Spider-Man responsibilities for more old-school heroic duty. The Hollywood action movie seems an open field right now partly because most of the male stars who headline non-comic-book blockbusters are middle-aged or older. Holland is 25. He’s cute without being threatening or distractingly, Chalamet-esquely beautiful, and has enough presence and training (dance, gymnastics, parkour) that he can bluff and breeze past clichés while gracefully bouncing through fights and obstacles. Cruise will be 61 when the next “Mission: Impossible” finally (maybe) opens in July 2023. He’s likely to keep going Energizer Bunny-style for years to come. Still, the paucity of young male actors who have the profile, credits and skill set to sell studio goods like “Uncharted” may prove a lucrative opportunity for Holland and his treasure-seeking handlers. At any rate that may explain the images of his character, Nate Drake, a thief who moonlights as a bartender (or vice versa), pulling some smooth moves on the job, a bit of juggling tomfoolery that instantly triggers images of Cruise in “Cocktail.” Soon enough, though, Nate leaves behind his gig and his New York pad for an international escapade that he embarks on in tandem with Mark Wahlberg’s Sully, a more experienced, openly untrustworthy thief. A veteran of workaday blockbusters, Wahlberg serves twinned functions here as a presold pop-culture brand and an archetypal mentor for Nate. Sully can sprint, fight and trade unfunny quips without breaking a sweat, and Wahlberg is just fine delivering the same gruff, regular-guy performance that he always does. He shares top billing with Holland, but Wahlberg is largely onboard as training wheels for the younger actor. “Uncharted” is based on a PlayStation game of the same name that first hit in 2007 and that tracks the globe-trotting doings of its Everyman hero, said to be descended from the British privateer Sir Francis Drake. The movie, directed by Ruben Fleischer, nods to the game and Sir Francis, who circumnavigated the globe in the 16th century and was instrumental in England’s challenge to Spain. Given the current climate, though, it’s a surprise that the movie didn’t quietly ignore Sir Francis, who participated in establishing the slave trade. In 2020, a statue of Sir Francis in Britain was draped in chains with a sign reading “decolonize history.” Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

"Feb 17, 2022"," Movies based on videogames are either entertaining or eye-rolling. An interactive videogame that works at home on your PlayStation may not offer the same dopamine rush when translated to the one-way interactivity of the big screen. For every “Detective Pikachu” that hits the mark there’s a dozen “BloodRaynes” or “Mortal Kombat: Annihilations.” “Uncharted,” a prequel to the wildly successful PlayStation series starring Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, and now playing in theatres, is the latest entry in the videogame sweepstakes. Holland plays Nathan Drake, who, unlike Spider-Man, the actor’s other cinematic alter-ego, uses his sticky fingers to steal stuff, not scale the outside of tall buildings. Either way, both characters are adventurers who live outside the margins. In Drake’s case, it comes naturally. He’s a direct descendant of 16th century pirate Sir Francis Drake. By day Nathan is a bartender in New York, by night he’s a thief. Day and night, he hopes to reunite with his long-lost treasure-hunting brother Sam who he hasn’t seen since he was ten years old. Big brother hit the road, with a promise to return, leaving behind memories and some cryptic clues to the location of $5 billion worth of Spanish explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s lost gold. “The gold isn’t gone,” he said, “it’s lost and if it is lost, it can be found.” When fast-talking slickster Victor ‘Sully’ Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) asks Nathan to help track down the lost treasure, he agrees, hoping to find the gold and information on his missing brother. “There’s only one rule,” says Sully of their dangerous mission. “Don’t get caught.” The pair, along with fortune hunter Chloe (Sophia Ali), travel the world in search of two crosses that serve as a key to the mystery, all the while trying to stay one or two steps ahead of ruthless rich guy Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who has a personal connection to the gold, and his team of mercenaries. “Uncharted” mixes and matches the adventure elements of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “Tomb Raider” and “National Treasure” into a generic action movie that loses its way early on. Not even the combined charisma of its stars, Holland and Wahlberg, can put it back on track. Both play thinly sketched versions of characters we’ve seen before and better. When he’s on-screen Wahlberg plays a riff on his trademarked sarcastic smart alecky character but this is a Where’s Waldo style role for him. He disappears for long sections as Holland takes center stage. Holland plays Nathan as a cocky young man with a special set of skills. Sound familiar? It’s like watching Peter Parker do parkour without the webs but with an unnatural gift for figuring out puzzles that have confounded others for centuries. He’s fun on screen but he’s not doing anything here that feels new. Then there are the action scenes. The movie opens with a frenetic fight scene, heavy on the CGI, that sees Nathan flying through the air, battling bad guys. It’s high-flying action, but don’t worry if you are five minutes late getting to the cinema, the scene is repeated later in the movie. The large-scale action scenes are loud, frenzied but often feel like leftovers from Pierce Brosnan era 007. They fill the screen, but the movie’s flippant, light tone ensures there is very little jeopardy involved for any of the main characters. “Uncharted” does have a pretty good villain, and no, it’s not Banderas who does little other than speak in a low whisper. Tati Gabrielle as the ruthless killer and schemer Braddock brings some spark to her scenes, but not enough to kickstart this inert action flick.

"Feb 17, 2022"," From the indie darling to the tips you need for day one of the biggest games to classic cheats and codes, Cultured Vultures has you covered when it comes to gaming. Join Cultured Vultures as we bring you some of the biggest news from the world of wrestling. Whether it’s WWE news or something from across the sea, let’s talk shop. Big screen adaptations are tricky – both to make and to review. For the filmmaker, the challenge lies in trying to capture the spirit of their source material while still telling a story that works on its own merits. For the reviewer, it lies in determining how well the filmmaker has balanced these two competing goals – and if they haven’t, whether that ultimately matters. All of which brings us to Uncharted, Sony Pictures’ new live-action reimagining of the acclaimed Naughty Dog video game series of the same name. In many ways, this flick is the epitome of the dichotomy at the heart of every adaptation – the contradictory need to be both the same and different to something that already exists. And it turns out that, as a standalone movie, Uncharted is passable (if only just), but as a cinematic retelling of the original games, it lands very wide of the mark. In fairness, director Ruben Fleischer and screenwriters Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway have clearly tried to translate the key elements of the Uncharted formula to the screen. As in the games, the film sees affable thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and his mentor Sully (Mark Wahlberg) on a globetrotting search for a mythical lost fortune (here, it’s Magellan’s stash of gold). Along the way, the pair have to contend with rival treasure hunters, including beguiling potential ally Chloe Fraser (Sophia Ali) and merciless billionaire Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his equally- right-hand woman, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). There are thrills, spills, and a dash of romance, and everything is wrapped up in under two hours. It’s harmless fun, and benefits from a solid underlying structure and brisk pacing. Yet even for an action-adventure romp, Uncharted’s plot feels surprisingly thin and perfunctory, especially considering the original Naughty Dog video games are celebrated not only for their strong storytelling, but their cinematic aspirations, as well. Here, plot points are checked off like the objectives in a video game – one way in which Uncharted actually manages to hew too closely to its source material. This robs Uncharted of the sense of breathless wonder it’s clearly shooting for. Watching Indiana Jones, one of Nathan Drake’s major influences, solve fiendish ancient puzzles felt revelatory, whereas watching Drake perform similar feats of deduction is utterly underwhelming. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas made sure we always had a window into Indy’s thought processes, so it felt like we were deciphering clues along with him. Fleischer, Judkins, Marcum and Holloway blitz through or even outright omit Drake’s own intellectual legwork, and the eventual payoff is far less satisfying as a result. The same goes for Uncharted’s action set pieces. Fleischer has clearly modelled these sequences on the rollicking, matinee-inspired escapades that defined the Indiana Jones franchise, however, Uncharted favours weightless, CGI-driven spectacle over the practical stunt work needed to sell such over-the-top shenanigans. And when Holland and Wahlberg finally get the chance to really-for-real make a death-defying leap or throw a big right hook, it all feels too slick – there’s none of the down and dirty, scrappy vibe that defined the movies Uncharted is so desperately trying to emulate. But above all, where Uncharted truly comes up short – as both a standalone movie and as an adaptation – is in telling a story we can properly engage with. Admittedly, Fleischer, Judkins, Marcum and Holloway really do try to make us care about Drake, Sully, and their big adventure. Both Drake and Sully have (very) basic character arcs which see them try to work through their trust issues, and Drake’s tragic backstory – he’s not driven by greed, but rather the prospect of reuniting with his long-lost brother – is meant to add an emotional dimension to Uncharted’s treasure hunt. But none of these beats really land, despite committed performances by Holland and Wahlberg. Holland in particular really gives it his all in Uncharted, channelling the full force of his likeable energy and impressive physicality as Nathan Drake – so it’s a shame he’s also hopelessly miscast. Instead of the strapping, 30-something rogue of the video games, the 25-year-old Holland plays Drake as a cockier, slightly less principled variation on his Peter Parker character from Marvel’s Spider-Man movies. To its credit, Uncharted cops to the many discrepancies between the pixel-powered and live-action incarnations of Drake (how could it not?), however, even non-gamers will cringe at the sight of the fresh-faced, more modestly statured Holland take on a role clearly designed for Harrison Ford-type action star. By contrast, Wahlberg is more convincing as Sully. True, he doesn’t look like Sully any more than Holland resembles Drake, but he does come somewhat closer to evoking Sully’s presence as depicted in the games. More importantly, Wahlberg shares strong chemistry with Holland, and the banter between the two – much of it built around the 50-year-old Wahlberg being ancient in the eyes of his youthful co-star – is the closest we come to forging a real emotional connection with these characters and their story. The rest of the cast fares poorly by comparison. Sophia Ali gets points for her physical similarity to the Chloe Fraser of the Uncharted games, but doesn’t exactly share a spark with Holland, and brings little else to the table other than what is – to this Aussie reviewer’s ears, at least – the most painfully broad faux-Australian accent in recent memory. Then there’s Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabrielle, whose considerable talents are wasted as Uncharted’s forgettable stock villains, thinly-sketched takes on the genre’s entitled rich guy and breathy femme fatale tropes. That’s not all that feels wasted in Uncharted, either, as even the film’s stunning locations receive short shrift. Director of photography Chung-hoon Chung makes Berlin (filling in for New York), Barcelona, and Costa Brava (doubling for several spots in Southeast Asia) look as gorgeous as you’d expect. Yet aside from a handful of establishing shots, Fleischer never gives us any sense of these places as real, lived-in environments, and – save for one notable exception involving a pair of airborne pirate ships late in the game – does nothing overly inventive with them in the way that, say, a Bond film would. You can’t help but feel like we deserved more. Apparently, that’s what we’ll get, too. Uncharted wraps up with a duo of now-obligatory post-credits scenes teasing a forthcoming sequel. So, here’s hoping that whenever Uncharted 2 finally arrives, those involved chart a different course than the one Fleischer and his cast and crew have plotted here.

"Feb 17, 2022"," It is a bittersweet moment when a cursed Hollywood production finally hits the screen. Any writer who has served their time at a film desk is intimately familiar with the troubled production history of Uncharted: Sonyâs ambitious video game adaptation has been part of the Hollywood rumor mill since 2008, even playing a key role in the now-infamous Sony email hacks. But now, having fought its way through a pandemic production, Uncharted is finally here â and the result is an affable piece of studio filmmaking that easily clears our collective lowered bar. After being separated from his brother in their childhood orphanage, young Nathan Drake (Holland) earns his living tending bar and lifting jewelry from his wealthy clientele. So when a man named Sully (Wahlberg) shows up and promises to help him secure the score of a lifetime, Drake is quick to say yes. But to do so â and retrace his brotherâs final steps â Holland must first earn the trust of the mysterious Chloe Frazer (Ali) and stay one step ahead of the dangerous Jo Braddock (Gabrielle, who easily steals the film from underneath her co-stars). In casting Holland and Wahlberg, the producers of Uncharted cast aside backstory in favor of star power. Not much is learned about Drake or Sully outside of their frequent barbs, and neither actor strays far from their signature personas. Wahlbergâs Sully is âill-tempered arroganceâ; Hollandâs Drake is âplucky physicality.â As a film, Uncharted is built around letting stage presence drive performance, and it is a credit to the general malleability of the source material that the whole thing mostly hangs together. These are roles that both actors could play without a script, so it is no big surprise that their schtick translates well to the family adventure genre. As far as the action sequences go, they work, too. Seams are everywhere â every close-up of Holland seems to have been shot in some COVID-proof green room, and one can only wish a speedy return to prestige fare for cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon. But these characters do appear to exist in a world where physics (and pain) seem analogous to our own. If anything, these sequences demonstrate our shifting approach to Hollywood set-pieces. For every Mission: Impossible sequel where Tom Cruise actually straps himself to an airborne plane, we can have one Uncharted, where the camera moves just fast enough to make the CGI never too egregious. This is the cinematic language of the modern studio film, and judged on those standards, this particular entry is fine. And maybe thatâs the biggest surprise. With so many video game adaptations being little more than live-action fanfiction, Uncharted stands out by feeling like an actual movie, mostly eschewing fan service in favor of little organic beats between characters. The result is something of a YA National Treasure â both movies are heist films for a generation raised on Dan Brown novels, where historical objects are awash in conspiracies and secret mechanisms. Throw in a healthy dose of profanity â surprising in its prevalence, which says more about Hollywood than Uncharted â and you have a film that has emerged from production hell not terribly worse for wear.

"Feb 17, 2022"," It didn’t take long for Hollywood to adapt another video game into a movie franchise. This has been an ongoing mission for as long as video games and movies have been around. However, cinema tends to struggle to find the balance in bringing these properties to life while adding something fresh to the adaptation. Unfortunately, there seems to be no signs of slowing down. If Mortal Kombat (2021) gave insight into the downward spiral we’d be on, Ruben Fleischer’s Uncharted is what happens when that slope runs out and ends with a perpetual fall to quality hell. The film follows Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) on his journey to find the Magellan treasure. This adventure started as a quest with his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) to bring glory to their ancestor Sir Francis Drake. But after Sam’s disappearance, in walks Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), his former fortune-hunting partner. He offers to help Nate search for both the gold and Sam. Together, they pair up with Sully’s partner Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) to embark on an underwhelming escapade that borrows from its source material but leaves quality behind in the process. I can’t say I’m surprised. Naughty Dog’s beloved and thrilling game series laid a great foundation of what a franchise could be. But unfortunately, the film refuses to lean in on some of the game’s best features. What’s worse is that it’s not for lack of trying. Indeed, scenes throughout Fleischer’s adaptation pay heavy homage to the games. Set designs and action sequences, for example, outshine the oversimplified treasure hunting aspect. But the real disappointment here lies in the team’s attempt to reveal an origin story but falling short of an effective one every step of the way. Whoever’s call it was to go this route needed to consider two questions. How do we appease the game’s fans and reel in new audiences with the Uncharted movie? Something tells me that “do the bare minimum” wasn’t explicitly stated in the writer’s room, but it’s exactly what appears to have happened. The reasons for this depiction resulting in an inadequate version are too obvious to ignore. They simply tried to do too much too soon. One of the easiest things to consider when explaining how the three writers (Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway) managed to overstuff this film and underwhelm simultaneously is to take you back to the first Uncharted. The foundation for what great storytelling could be was there for the production team’s disposal. There were great characters, sure. But the important thing we fans got to experience was the connections between them. That meant spending time developing their relationships, observing how they operate in the line of fire, etc. As a result, fans established connections to the characters long before supporting roles were even created.

"Feb 17, 2022"," As “Uncharted” begins, we see Tom Holland asleep with a blue sky behind him. The image is peaceful, except for the steady, hard-to-place sound of rushing wind. Then he opens his eyes and a split second later, he realizes what we’ve just figured out: He is in the middle of the sky, and falling. It’s common for adventure movies to begin with a splashy action sequence, but most of the time, we get spectacle for the sake of spectacle. It’s too early to care what’s happening before we know why it’s happening. But this opener is so visceral — this is a place we’ve all visited in our nightmares — that our investment is instantaneous. The start of “Uncharted” is about as effective as can be imagined. What follows just builds on the situation, until the sequence is abruptly interrupted by a flashback. That usually doesn’t work well, either: Here we were having fun, and now we’re getting thrust back into the boring part of the story. But no, not this time. “Uncharted” takes its foot off the gas, but the video game adaptation doesn’t lose velocity. It stays interesting. Holland — who is beginning to seem like he can play anything — is Nathan, an orphan who lives by his wits as an adult. His only close relative is his brother, but he hasn’t seen him in years. And then one day, he meets Victor (Mark Wahlberg), who recruits him to help find the lost treasure of Ferdinand Magellan. This lost treasure is in gold, and there’s a ton of it. Over the course of the movie, Nathan and Victor do their best to find it, but notice this: At no point do they ever have a plan as to how to carry it out. This would seem to be an oversight. Nathan and Victor follow a series of ridiculous clues that make no apparent sense, each requiring some unlikely intuitive leap that invariably turns out right. This has been the formula for lots of mediocre adventures, so why does the formula work so well this time? It’s hard to say, but “Uncharted” was directed by Ruben Fleischer, who made “Zombieland: Double Tap” and the first “Venom” — two other genre movies that turned out a little better than they had to. “Uncharted” benefits from the combination of Holland’s light energy and Wahlberg’s dark energy, Holland’s open-book quality and Wahlberg’s way of making his eyes go opaque. Wahlberg has a funny way of simultaneously making you want to trust him and not trust him at all. The movie further benefits from Antonio Banderas, as the chief competitor for the treasure. He’s the cold-blooded billionaire descendant of the noble Spanish family that bankrolled Magellan — who else besides Banderas would you get to play somebody like that? There are also two strong women’s roles — played by Sophia Ali and the San Francisco-born Tati Gabrielle — each thoroughly evil, ready to do anything to get that gold. Needless to say, “Uncharted” eventually ends up back in the sky, with Holland opening his eyes to find himself in a real-life falling nightmare. Yet somehow the movie manages to top even that.",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Tom Holland does his best version of Indiana Jones in Uncharted, a mediocre take on a very good video game franchise. The film is based on Naughty Dog’s extremely popular action-adventure series, and alongside the excitement of the video games, this two-hour jaunt into Nathan Drake’s world feels limp, at best. Director Ruben Fleischer does his best to bring flashy set pieces and tensely-wrought action sequences into the narrative, but for most of the movie you wish you were the one holding the controls. UNCHARTED ★★ (2/4 stars)
Directed by: Ruben Fleischer
Written by: Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, Matt Holloway
Starring: Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, Antonio Banderas
Running time: 116 mins. As Nate, Holland is likable and attractive, although he isn’t given much characterization to work with. Here Nate is a suave New York bartender who swipes jewelry off unsuspecting customers, and he seems ready for adventure—a quick montage of him doing push-ups and rope climbs in his tiny apartment makes that, along with Holland’s swelling biceps, overtly clear. One night Victor “Sully” Sullivan, a badly miscast Mark Wahlberg, shows up at the bar and coerces Nate into helping him find a legendary stash of gold that dates back five hundred years, lost during the circumnavigating expedition of Ferdinand Magellan. Sully thinks Nate has a clue that will lead them to the gold, thanks to Nate’s long-lost brother Sam, shown only in a requisite flashback. The unlikely pair, who have as much chemistry as a PlayStation and an X-Box controller, set off on a mission to follow a sequence of clues with the help of Chloe (Sophia Ali). They’re armed with two gold crosses—actually keys—and a journal left behind by the captain of Magellan’s ship. Unfortunately, Santiago Moncada, whose ancestors funded the Magellan mission, also wants the gold. The one-dimensional villain, played gamely by Antonio Banderas, has an unlimited supply of money and many, many disposable henchmen. Essentially, the story is about two competing teams globe-trotting for the treasure, with dashes of Indiana Jones, National Treasure and recent Fast and Furious movies along the way.  Uncharted plays like something that has been written and rewritten too many times by too many people—the screenplay is credited to Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway—and Hollard, as amiable as he is, remains an odd choice to play Nathan Drake. In a short fan film from 2018, avid gameplayers cast Nathan Fillion in the role and the actor fit perfectly into Nate’s rugged shoes. Holland is a genuine movie star, particularly after Spider-Man: No Way Home, but he’s noticeably younger than the video game character with whom so many are familiar. Uncharted serves as a new prequel, of sorts, although after over a decade of development and numerous release date changes, it’s unclear what it’s intended as a prequel to.  The film’s finale, which involves a knock-out fight on pirate ships being flown over the ocean by helicopters, is absolutely ludicrous (so much so that it’s also pretty entertaining). But then almost everything in this movie requires some suspension of disbelief. Nate, thanks to his many push-ups and years of slinging a cocktail shaker, swings on ropes, jousts with swords and shoots guns like he’s had extensive training, and he solves complicated puzzles in all of five seconds. Ali and Tati Gabrielle, who plays mercenary Jo Braddock, are capable actors who give their characters a sense of sincerity, but Wahlberg basically just does his scenes as himself with a backpack and an obsession with gold. In the same way F9 made no sense but was mostly fun to watch, Uncharted sometimes finds real moments of fast-paced entertainment. It moves quickly and it’s a good diversion, even with the drag of Wahlberg.  Fans of the Uncharted franchise will enjoy the recreation of certain game moments and there are a few enticing nods in the two post-credits scenes, although the movie isn’t a remake of any particular game or storyline. It falters in similar ways to past video game adaptations, notably Tomb Raider and Hitman. Hollywood seems dead-set on continuing to channel video game IP onto the big screen, but the studios never have much success. It’s difficult to come up with one that’s really worked, save maybe for Detective Pikachu, which was a visually-stunning surprise. Did we need an Uncharted movie? No. Is it worth seeing? Sure, if you have nothing else to do and you’ve already played all the games in the series.

"Feb 17, 2022"," From the director of “Venom” … need I say more. “Uncharted” is adapted from the Playstation video game of the same name. For those unfamiliar with the game, it’s just another modern day Indiana Jones. With the global success of “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and a lack of film choices at the box office, “Uncharted” should quench the thirst for more Tom Holland. However, don’t expect great writing, acting or anything beyond an overreliance on stunts and special effects. Holland and Mark Wahlberg have little chemistry on screen, with the rest of the cast inhabiting forgettable characters. Playing second fiddle to Spider-Man, Wahlberg gets dad jokes matching his bored expression throughout the film. For fans of the video game or children 10 and under, the cliches and tropes of the genre might not be so tiring as it is for adults. Internet forum rules ...

"Feb 17, 2022"," Solía ser que los videojuegos eran entretenimiento sencillo: brinca aquí, corre para la derecha, dispara allá, salva la princesa, en cuarenta minutos terminamos. Adaptarlos a película era un reto, porque rara vez tenían alguna trama que contar, mucho menos justificar 90 minutos o más de contenido. En un irónico brinco del destino, gracias a los avances tecnológicos, aumento de presupuesto y competencia cada vez más dura, los videojuegos fueron volviéndose fuentes de historias más elaboradas, rivalizando el séptimo arte, al punto que adaptar un videojuego se volvió complicado por haber demasiado de donde sacar. Que mejor evidencia que algunas de las mejores adaptaciones estén en pantalla pequeña, donde creativos han podido substraer las crónicas para darnos excelentes series como Castlevania, Arcane, y DOTA: Dragon’s Blood. Pero el cine no se rinde y esta semana llega Uncharted, una adaptación que, tomó tanto tiempo, Mark Wahlberg pasó de interpretar el protagonista a ser el mentor de apoyo. Afortunadamente eso significó que el arrojado explorador sea encarnado por el carismático Tom Holland, fresquecito de su monumental éxito en Spider-Man: No Way Home. Uncharted está perfectamente ok. Nada revolucionario, nada rompe curva, simplemente un buen rato en el cine, para disfrutar las interacciones entre Holland y Walhberg, las secuencias de acción, persecución, y decente humor. No me aburrí en ningún momento, aunque una gran razón es la familiaridad con el material de origen (yo he jugado todos los juegos de la franquicia, excepto los títulos de PS Vita), y el uso de clichés del género –algunos quizás demasiado- como constantes traiciones y cambios de bando. Es el equivalente cinemático de ir a un restaurante de comidas rápidas; conocido, nada nutritivo, pero se consume tan fácil y veloz como se olvida. Holland es Nathan Drake, un cantinero aprovechando su trabajo en un restaurante lujoso para robarles a clientes millonarios, mientras busca su hermano perdido hace más de 10 años. Cuando un ladrón profesional llamado Sully (Wahlberg) lo recluta para un trabajo, descubre que su hermano estaba buscando el tesoro de Francisco de Magallanes que tanto discutían cuando niños, y ahora Sully también persigue, en competencia con otros ladrones, como Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), quien trabaja para Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas, cobrando un cheque sin mucho esfuerzo). También se les une Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), otra exploradora queriendo el tesoro para si misma. Al igual que los juegos, la aventura llevará el elenco a través de distintas partes del mundo, aunque no tantas localidades como esperaba, y sorpresivamente más cerradas de las que hemos visto en los siete títulos de la franquicia. Para ser una historia fuertemente inspirada en Indiana Jones, Uncharted nunca logra fascinarnos como lo hicieron las travesías de Indy, ni repetir la sensación de ansiedad durante las persecuciones, quedándose en lo dolorosamente genérico. El estilo direccional de Ruben Fleischer (Venom, Zombieland) es lo suficiente dinámico para mantener la trama moviéndose, con algunos momentos destacándose, como un escape desde un avión, y la alocada secuencia final. En realidad sales mejor jugando cualquiera de los títulos (el mejor obviamente siendo Uncharted: Among Thieves) pero tampoco pierdes entrando a verla en pantalla grande, pues Uncharted es un decente rato en el cine que me entretuvo de principio a fin.

"Feb 17, 2022"," Even when based on a video game, naming an adventure movie Uncharted is a bold move. There’s not much left to discover in the genre of historically inclined adventurers who face impossible danger to uncover buried treasure. But that doesn’t mean a journey into familiar surroundings can’t still be fun. For instance, I admired the reboot of Tomb Raider from 2018 starring Alicia Vikander and still hope for a follow-up, even though the Angelina Jolie versions remain an embarrassment. As for Naughty Dog’s Uncharted game franchise and its various sequels, they were bound to become Hollywood movies. Similar to the Lara Croft games, they represent another in a long line of Indiana Jones knock-offs that blend archeology and mythology with globe-trotting exploits and the occasional supernatural force. But they’re exciting games, usually well-written, epic in scale, and unabashedly cinematic. So it goes without saying that Hollywood would want to turn that intellectual property into a major motion picture. However cynical one could become toward the prospect of another breed of Romancing the Stone (1984), The Goonies (1985), or National Treasure (2004), Uncharted defies all odds, despite its gaming origins. Indeed, the history of movies based on video games is a sad chronicle of Uwe Boll disasters, Milla Jovovich starrers, and animated blue hedgehogs. Only last year did two movies, Werewolves Within and Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, manage to upend expectations and deliver on their potential. With few exceptions, video game source material usually results in a mess, disappointing fans and underwhelming the casual viewer. But Uncharted is a movie that understands the link between the franchise’s movie and game origins—all the more impressive given how long producer Avi Arad and Sony have been trying to get this made. A half-dozen directors, ranging from David O. Russell to Shawn Levy, tried to nail down the adaptation. The job finally landed in Ruben Fleischer’s hands, and the director of Zombieland (2009) and Venom (2018) delivers serviceable escapism.  After playing through the Uncharted games over the years, I expected to see cutthroat treasure seekers, chummy banter, underground tombs, elaborate puzzles, a loose sense of history, double-crosses, some parkour, and high-flying action. And the movie makes good on all fronts to varying degrees. Tom Holland plays the young Nathan Drake, who, years earlier, was separated from his brother Sam (Rudy Pankow). Orphans both, the Drake brothers hail from legendary pirate Sir Francis Drake, so adventure is in their blood. While on his own, Nathan, serving as a bartender straight out of Cocktail (1988), is recruited by his long-lost brother’s former partner, the duplicitous Sully (Mark Wahlberg). They’re both after a treasure lost since Magellan’s expedition in the sixteenth century, putting them on the hunt for two golden keys and a map that leads to billions in gold. The trail takes our heroes from the US to Barcelona to the Philippines. And from the midair physics-defying opener to the swashbuckling climax, the movie doesn’t disappoint in its video game logistics, which are only slightly more cartoonish than the average Hollywood blockbuster.  Investigating priceless antiquities with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer, our heroes have enough star power to overcome their miscasting. Wahlberg looks about 10-20 years too young for the usually grisled Sully, and Holland’s boyish appearance, while fodder for the pair’s banter, underlines the movie’s origin story quality (not to mention Sony wanting to invest in their Spider-Man star). There’s even a conspicuous montage of Holland exercising, which establishes that he’s somewhat more buff than Peter Parker and thus capable of Nathan Drake’s acrobatics—and without the help of a radioactive spider. Of course, he’ll need every well-honed muscle against the resident villain Santiago Moncada, played by Antonio Banderas. The latter delivers each line from the back of his throat and seems to enjoy playing the heavy. The supporting cast of characters includes Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), Moncada’s ruthless right hand, and competing fortune hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). And while Gabrielle and Ali steal the show, Holland and Wahlberg fill their roles sufficiently.  As a franchise fan, I found Uncharted to be a mostly fun and faithful movie, minus my quibbles about the somewhat miscast leads. Mind you, my enjoyment stems from lowered expectations and a better-than-average video game adaptation. The movie’s moderate pleasures won’t invite fervent rewatches or convert those unfamiliar with the source material—unless they’re rampant Holland or Wahlberg fans—but it keeps the viewer rapt in the unfolding plot. At least one of the twists and turns along the way brought a genuine shock, while the inorganic cameo by Nolan North (the game’s mo-cap actor who plays Nathan Drake) may seem confounding to the unfamiliar. Even though I had more of an emotional response to the last game, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End from 2016, and I’d rather be playing the game, Sony’s production kept my attention for two hours. That’s more than I can say for most movies based on video games. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," You would think adapting a video game is an easy task. The blueprint is already made as many playable works, especially those of modern times, have in their programming at least one cinematic element. And when there are plenty to spare, “cinematic trailers” to promote the games can even be assembled, afterward eligible for a Golden Trailer Award. But if the two iterations of Hitman, Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil and plenty more have shown, it is indeed a quest easier said rather than done. Not exactly strong responses to promos. Weak reviews on release. A “curse” gets mentioned. The consensus becomes to be fine with games going filmic yet to be wary with films tackling games. If the two mediums were a couple, without doubt only one is in better shape. And as long as apathy keeps on being present, this pattern continues. Uncharted has plenty of apathy. Yes, the expected limitations of a code-free reality and liberties taken to “un-game” game features are in the footage, but apathy is the item that keeps glinting. Based on the hit Naughty Dog games featuring adventurer Nathan Drake, this film sees itself as such since 2008, but the final product is more a mix between the need to get this off people’s plates for good and the wisdom to carve a new trail for the IP with the most basic, boring moves. In other words, the time, talent and reportedly $120 million went into manifesting this project that didn’t seem to want to be realized would have been better spent on a sequel to The Adventures of Tintin. Maybe a contemporary take on Cocktail, even, as reminded by the silver-tongued nature of this Nathan (Tom Holland) and some set pieces’ sporadic leanings into his bartending skills. Isn’t the bartender protagonist a lift from Assassin’s Creed, or a mark of character coolness that is much busier than Naughty Dog’s scribing and Nolan North’s voice? There is a problem with your video game adaptation when all it does is evoke everything else besides its source material, or at the least the joys within it. Holland does what he can with his apparent nimbleness and a palpably ardent will to self-validate, but that alone is far from enough to make Uncharted functional. In fact, he is the only player cognizant of the charms that Amy Hennig and company had embedded into their treasure hunter, even when his attempts are constantly undermined by writing (from Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) and direction (from Ruben Fleischer) supercharged with the “let’s just get this done” mentality. Needless to say, that is not “let’s just get this right” seen and felt in the four main games, whose key spices—all more spectacle-based than character—have been cherry-picked, slapped together and dismissed to form the next 116 minutes.  When it is decided that the familial notes of A Thief’s End and Drake’s Deception as your film’s fuel, why not give Nathan’s love for his missing brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) some weight and ask this swole version of Sully (Mark Wahlberg) to stop being a drill sergeant and instead a mentor? When said fuel goes into a vehicle with the looks of both Drake’s Fortune and Among Thieves, why is passivity the distinct trait in outmaneuvering the moneyed Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his fashionable assassin Jo (Tati Gabrielle)? Or in the syncing and trading of wits with Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), whose name is initially pronounced as “Klo”? The rush for the gold hidden by the crew of renowned explorer Ferdinand Magellan is, to one’s shock, unfeeling despite plenty of diving, flying, swimming, running and shooting from the characters—and, more importantly, despite the constant tug of the brother who may have perished. See what apathy has wrought. And from the indifference surfaces less an effort to translate the magic that is already there and more subpar cosplay currently showing in thousands of theaters. Unplugging Uncharted then becomes a smart move, but that will also reveal how this is not a good adventure film. It is loud and occasionally pretty—all thanks to director of photography Chung Chung-hoon, growing more comfortable with every new high-profile work—but not good. Sure, the next opportunity to mess around the fountains of Barcelona’s Palau Nacional or to see carracks engage in a dogfight over the waters of the Philippines might be ways away, yet the thrill is hollow without the romance. It’s like a skeleton deluding itself into believing it has some internal mass—to be blunt a worthy cinematic pair of the games—when the writing has a habit of telling what it is showing, the pacing vaults past character beats as if it’s a speedrun session, the summoning of roguish charm always borders loathing, and the music (from Ramin Djawadi) isn’t exactly aware of where its spirit of adventure has just landed. Again, apathy at work. And to also detect it at the level where Uncharted as yet another adventure film says a lot about the higher-ups in the game-to-film pipeline: They keep failing to reverse the curse because they don’t have enough love for the games they have bought the rights to. The blueprint from the developers, barely studied. They themselves make the adapting process difficult and then, as always, wonder why the play-through doesn’t end with a “ding!” and a “Charted!”",NEGATIVE
"Feb 17, 2022"," Do not miss the opening scene, especially if you risked your life during a global pandemic to see this movie on the biggest screen possible. (On IMAX it looks truly phenomenal!) The movie proper begins after the in media res opening scene and a flashback, which sounds like a long way to travel, simply to start a mindless movie based on a video game, but it sets up the sequence of events to follow and succeeds in making one anxious to watch the next action scene, whatever it might be, because it promises to relieve the tedium of sitting through yet another narrative exposition, which really doesn’t matter anyway, since this movie is all about the action scenes.  Well, that’s basically the plot of Uncharted, the live-action movie, directed by Ruben Fleischer, known especially for good-hearted comedies, starting with Zombieland (2009) and the extremely zippy, if less-heralded 30 Minutes or Less (2011), followed most recently by the larger-scale action pictures Venom (2018) and Zombieland: Double Tap (2019), which both played down to lowered expectations.  Tati Gabrielle adroitly portrays Braddock, a sleek, mysterious and deadly figure; Antonio Banderas plays Santiago Moncada, an heir to a fortune who speaks Spanish, which makes him immediately suspect; and Sophia Allie embodies the winsome Chloe Frazer, whose true motives remain unknown, yet highly suspicious.  Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg manifest their charming, friendly, and winning personalities as though they were on the longest red carpet in the world, which makes their constant, occasionally amusing banter the rightful center of the wildly uneven action adventure.  In the screenplay, which is credited to Rafe Judkins (the recent Prime Video series The Wheel of Time) and the team of Art Macum and Matt Holloway, who also produced, and are known for writing Transformers: The Last Knight and Men in Black: International, Uncharted doesn’t explore new territory so much as it reimagines a modern adventure movie. The film is quite open in its unspoken admiration for the great action classics that have come before, and even proudly name-checks one.  Its focus, though, is on imagining ever more outlandish and outrageously elaborate action sequences. Slender as it is, the slender plot-line is only intended to connect, somehow, the dashing, incredibly involved, daring-if-they-were-real sequences, which are deliriously unrealistic and unmoored to any sort of recognizable human reality.  The plot holes are big enough to hurl a flying pirate ship through, with room to spare for anything else your heart might desire to see on a big, big movie screen. The more, the merrier. The film opens Friday, February 18, only in movie theaters, via Sony. For more information about the film, visit the official site. Copyright 2010-2024 Peter A. Martin.

"Feb 16, 2022"," “Uncharted” is the latest in a proliferation of video game adaptations, and it’s not hard to see why this PlayStation game, which launched with “Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune” in 2007, was quickly picked up by Hollywood. The game, which came a few years on the heels of “National Treasure,” with Nicolas Cage, was very much based on movies. So it’s probably inevitable that “Uncharted” feels like a copy of a copy.  But, you might thinking, so what? Globe-trotting adventures with puzzles and tunnels and booby trap are, by their nature, fun. Even a bland imitation — which is what “Uncharted” is — can be a good enough time. What you get out of “Uncharted” will likely depend on your standard of “a good enough time,” but you can’t fault it for skimping on scale, or failing to stuff itself to the gills with ancient texts and symbols and old maps. If it’s treasure hunting you seek, regardless of reward, you have found it.  Director Ruben Fleischer, who eventually took over after “Uncharted” was in development for years with a long list of filmmakers, brings visual clarity and a touch of inventiveness to a handful of glossy set pieces. The movie opens with Nathan spinning through the air, a fitting place to start given that “Uncharted” trails Holland’s last flight in  “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” by just two months.  But after a few swings behind a cargo plane, “Uncharted” jumps back to Nathan’s childhood in New York. He’s there with his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), who describes them as descendants of the English explorer Sir Francis Drake and exhibits some of the same spirit of exploration. He’s particularly fixated on the path of Ferdinand Magellan and treasure said to have been hidden by his expedition in the 16th century. When they’re caught trying to steal Magellan’s map, Sam is kicked out of the orphanage and the two never see each other again. Nathan occasionally receives postcards from far away.  It is, for sure, a postcard-thin backstory. But “Uncharted” gets properly underway when Nathan, now working as a bartender and petty thief, encounters Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), an old treasure-hunting companion of Nathan’s brother, who comes to him with a mission to find Magellan’s lost treasure. Once they’ve tracked down a pair of MacGuffins — er, ancient keys — they set off for more clues in Barcelona. They have some competition, including a maybe-trustworthy adventurer named Chloe (Sophie Ali). But their main foe is a wealthy Spanish descendant of the Moncada family that financed Magellan’s trip, still looking to recoup. He’s played by Antonio Banderas, in his most growling villain mode, who’s joined by a lethal martial artist (Tati Gabrielle).  There are other things a little out of sync in the wanly watchable “Uncharted.” Every artifact uncovered in pursuit of the lost gold would, in their own right, be worth a fortune. And the bad guys here are so well financed that they could probably just sell their gear and be equally wealthy.  “Uncharted,” a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for violence/action and language.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Play just a few minutes of any Uncharted video game, and the basic concept becomes clear: What if you could be the main character in a blockbuster action-adventure film? Embodied by the dashing treasure hunter Nathan Drake, the player leaps from boulder to boulder, explores ancient ruins, and exchanges gunfire with evil mercenaries in a modern update on Indiana Jones. The series is so obviously indebted to the storytelling rhythms of movies that, about a year after the game’s 2007 release, work on a film adaptation began. But how to keep the project from feeling like a copy of a copy, a derivation of something that was already loudly, intentionally derivative? Well, after waiting more than a decade for the film’s development and keeping watch on its changing roster of high-profile directors and stars, we still don’t have an answer. Uncharted, directed by Ruben Fleischer and starring Tom Holland as Nathan, is a depressingly routine affair that fails to replicate the joys of its source material. When playing a video game, you can easily perceive the bindings of the world you’re within, the invisible rails guiding the player along the journey that’s been scripted for them. In the past few years, video-game-to-film adaptations such as Sonic the Hedgehog have tried and failed to translate that bird’s-eye view into a climactic story. The film version of Uncharted feels even more limited than its predecessors, plodding between a few familiar-looking locales and vainly searching for the vaguest of narrative stakes. The movie’s most fundamental error came before the cameras even started rolling: Holland is a bizarre casting choice as Nathan, who’s supposed to be a grizzled, stubbly roustabout we meet in his 30s, with many years of treasure hunting under his belt. Holland is 25 years old but still presents on-screen as an overeager teenager, recalling his work in the Spider-Man films; every line is delivered as an anguished yelp or a pleading sigh. To counteract Holland’s glaring youth, the story (written by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway) is positioned as a prequel to the game series, with more emphasis on Mark Wahlberg’s role as Nathan’s mentor and partner, Sully, who helps introduce him to the world of cutthroat antiquing. In the games, Sully is a cigar-chomping, fun-loving father figure; much like Holland, Wahlberg doesn’t seem to have gotten the character memo. The film should thrive on buddy energy, but their repartee is grimly forced, a grab bag of generic insults batted back and forth (Nathan is young, Sully’s old; Nathan is short, Sully is slightly less short; and so on). Wahlberg’s script probably should have been printed on the back of his paychecks, just to gin up a little enthusiasm for the material. Instead, as with several big-budget vehicles he’s starred in recently (think Infinite or the most recent Transformers movie), Wahlberg seems almost actively disdainful of the lines he’s reading, dispensing them through gritted teeth. Holland’s gee-whiz energy is equally frustrating. Nathan, a cheerful novice who grew up in an orphanage and whose older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), vanished when he was a kid, seems entirely unsuited to the backstabbing tactics of treasure seeking. Sully repeatedly tells him to trust no one, and the two duplicitous femmes fatales the pair cross paths with, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) and Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), give little reason to discount that advice, yet Nathan remains fairly guileless. Antonio Banderas introduces another threat as a villainous Spanish tycoon who delivers every line with a rueful purr. They’re all in pursuit of the explorer Magellan’s lost fortune, some hoping for riches but others (like Nathan) more driven by the sheer sense of adventure. To Fleischer’s credit, he endeavored to film mostly on location and avoid the hermetic feeling of green-screen sets. The middle portion of the film, easily the strongest, has fun with the characters bounding through the streets and sewers of Barcelona. Still, the movie can’t even summon the puzzle-solving energy of something like the most recent film adaptation of Tomb Raider. There’s rarely much logic at work; Sully consults one ancient text from time to time, but most of the clues leading our heroes from location to location are obvious. That episodic structure is more acceptable in a video game, where each new site is a whole universe to explore; in Uncharted, many of the destinations feel anonymous. The action sequences are similarly tame, but for one death-defying skydive out of a cargo plane that is composed almost entirely of goopy CGI and is many steps removed from the thrillingly real stunt work of a Mission: Impossible movie. Any Uncharted adaptation would have had a difficult task at hand, given the original material. Video games have gotten quite good at imitating movies, but translating games to cinema has always proved a much more challenging task. Games like Uncharted require a nonspecific tinge to their storytelling so that any player can identify with the world he’s operating in. But Uncharted removes the thrill of controlling the main character, leading to a sterile, banal viewing experience, a tech demo for an out-of-date product.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," Uncharted is a new action adventure film from Ruben Fleischer, the director of Zombieland and Venom, with Rafe Lee Judkins (The Wheel of Time) as co-screenwriter. As the name of the film makes clear, it’s a live-action adaption of the popular video game series, which is essentially a modern day Indiana Jones set up, where globetrotters and professional thieves go to extraordinary lengths to find the last, lost secrets of history. To that end, Uncharted is quite faithful to the nooks and crannies of the games, almost to a fault but not quite. Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, a vivacious pickpocket who cares more about finding his long-lost brother, Sam, than any supposed fortune. He teams up with the older Sully, played by Mark Wahlberg, who used to work with his brother and offers a chance at finding a mother lode of a treasure Nate’s been dreaming about since he was a kid. Along the way they compete with dastardly villains and uneasy allies, including a slippery fortune hunter named Chloe and played by Sophia Ali, a ruthless billionaire played by Antonio Banderas, and a cutthroat mercenary played by Tati Gabrielle. Similar to the games, Uncharted spends most of its time and attention trying to get two main things right. First, the set pieces. Uncharted isn’t Uncharted without thrilling blockbuster moments, and one of the obvious challenges of adapting the game is that you’re going from one medium where you can interactively play the set piece and experience the breathless action as the character, to the big screen version of storytelling where you’re just another face in the audience. Fortunately, the movie mostly gets out of this jam by amping up the danger and ecstasy in each of these ambitious scenes, starting right off the bat with a deliriously fun climb up loose cargo that is hanging from an airplane in danger of crashing. It’s certainly a call back to the second game’s triumphant opening sequence, where you have to scale a train that is falling down a mountain, and then of course the third game’s literal plane crash. So it works here for the film to quite literally set the stakes even higher, and incorporate other characters and physical twists that the game couldn’t really pull off without using a cutscene. The second thing Uncharted has to get right is the intrigue between characters. An added bonus would be for the mystery and treasure itself to be engaging and surprising, but the film never quite lands that target. But its saving grace is that it does have a competent, visceral hook into the character development of Nathan and Sully, and how their tension naturally progresses into something resembling honor among thieves. The film’s external and internal conflicts are far from uncharted territory, especially for films in this genre. But it works because these conflicts are executed in purely entertaining ways. So we’ve all seen the chase scene through the streets of a European city, in this case Barcelona, but the added flair of fancy here is Tom Holland’s parkour and how he has to pull off various, implausible stunts within the frame, with only a brief introductory montage toward the beginning to make clear how his training regiment would make him such a spry scaler. The film does trip over itself one too many times when it halting to call back directly to the video games, with one cameo in particular that is so egregious, I imagine people in the audience who’ve never played the games will assume it’s just an unforced error of a whiff that should’ve been cut out entirely, and they’d be right. Other times, the call backs are far more subtle and gratifying as tributes to the source material, without really distracting fans of the games who would otherwise want to stop watching and pick up the controller, instead. And that probably comes down to how likable of a performer Holland himself is, where he can pretty much develop his own Nathan Drake whole cloth, less an imitation and more an adaptation of necessity. The hard truth is that he simply doesn’t look much at all like the iconic fortune hunter, but this works in the film’s favor because if he did, then we really would have to consider why a movie should be made at all. All said, it’s a wonderfully unassuming, unpretentious blockbuster adventure with swashbuckling action, inventive set pieces, emotional character growth, and light-hearted quips that make the whole journey easy to sit through, let alone play through. It works as an Uncharted movie, it works as its own adventurous franchise starter, and it works as just about anything in between, assuming you’re willing to meet this film at its own breezy level.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Drawn from a popular action-adventure game series, it’s kind of surprising how old school this adaptation is. Settling into the well worn traditions of the Raiders, Mummys, and National Treasures, this one is only truly fun thanks to its very game cast. The lithe and charming Tom Holland stars as Drake, a nimble thief who is wooed into a treasure hunt of historic proportions, by veteran Mark Wahlberg. He’s Sully, btw. And Sully may just know more than he’s telling, as the two hop off to Barcelona to try and recover a fortune in gold, lost by Magellan some 500 years ago. Sophia Ali makes a very pretty and capable ally, or bad guy, or who knows what. And Antonio Banderas shows up as the rich thug who makes things difficult for our bounty hunters. While everyone here is of age and mention is made of past romances, the PG-13 rating is earned for its occasional violence and, hold onto your seats, language. Yes, there are a few “bad words”, but that’s about as passionate all these great looking people get. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, who gave us popular hits such as Venom, doesn’t waste time on a lot of fine points here. He’s aiming for something mass appeal and, while this one feels far shallower than the movies it tries to emulate, it’s not painful to watch, either. Perhaps your mileage will vary, depending upon your expectations. Keep ‘em low and you’ll be okay.",POSITIVE

"Feb 16, 2022"," The act of adapting a video game is taking an interactive story and removing the fun part — the playing of the game — which is the predominant draw of the medium. So the movie has to enhance the entertainment value of the story, whether that’s with over-the-top character portrayals (see Sonic the Hedgehog) or the sort of intense scares and action you’d expect from any good genre fare (see Silent Hill and some of the better Resident Evil installments). Uncharted, based on Sony’s hit video game series, gets points for at least making an effort with its outrageous characterizations and cinematic thrills. But it never overcomes two major problems: the “heroes” are unlikeable rogues, and their adventure is entirely based on greed. They’re indistinguishable from the “villains” in both regards. Following an unnecessary bit of action in media res, the movie goes back 15 years to introduce us to orphan brothers Nathan and Sam Drake as they attempt to steal a map from a museum. Sam runs away, leaving his brother behind, and the next time we see Nathan, now played as an adult by Tom Holland, he’s a bartender and petty thief who snatches jewelry off his customers while waiting on them. In comes Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) with a proposition. Together, they will embark on a trip to find a lost treasure of gold dumped by the survivors of the Magellan expedition in 1522 — and maybe also find the long-lost Sam. After an internet search that lets Nathan and us in on who Sully is as a person/character, they team up and plan an auction-house heist. That plan goes somewhat wrong, and it’s only the first of many fumbles made by the protagonists. Are we meant to be reminded that Nathan is a video game character and so by nature has a fallible brain – i.e. that of an everyday ordinary gamer – within his perfect superhero-fit body? At times he seems like a kid who has suddenly been given parkour skills but doesn’t exactly know what to do with them. Both Nathan and Sully are constantly dumbfounded by their luck as if they weren’t sure they could actually pull off any of the steps in their operation. Wahlberg, in particular, looks stunned most of the time as he utters “holy shit!” or “are you kidding me?!” in moments of astoundment coupled with relief. The two of them are nothing but knucklehead bros playing Indiana Jones. But Indiana Jones, in addition to being more confident, has a moral code defining his treasure hunting exploits. He believes the artifacts he seeks belong in a museum (an honorable notion that is also a debatable one in certain global contexts) and definitely not in the hands of Nazis. Nathan and Sully just want the gold for themselves. As do the other mercenaries and henchmen they encounter, whether they be allies or adversaries (including far more interesting characters played by Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle, plus Steven Waddington as a Scottish accent personified). The big bad of Uncharted, Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), may in fact be the most entitled to the riches given that his ancestors financed the expedition in the first place so many centuries ago. What makes Nathan the one we should care about to find and walk away with the gold? He’s just the guy who wins the game, as it were. That would be fine if he was sold as an antihero who then has to grow as a character, out of his small-time swindling and into someone more virtuous. Other characters tell him he’s a “good guy… too good,” but the movie doesn’t really do anything to show us that about him outside of his being more trusting than everyone else. That’s not good, it’s naive. Meanwhile, Sully is allotted the end of a character arc but not the beginning of one. To make up for their being underwritten, though, the movie does something even worse with the duo: it gives them incessant banter as though they’re supposed to be the ill-matched main characters in a buddy comedy, always bickering and jabbing for no other reason than to have them babbling on and on, perhaps to distract from the lackluster plot. Of course, they keep on with the jokey back and forth even when the movie ups the action in the third act. Without going into spoilers, Uncharted delivers one of the more original and spectacular set-pieces in recent memory, at least conceptually. Ruben Fleischer’s directorial execution of this sequence – and as a result the editorial execution, as well – leaves a lot to be desired. But there are a number of shots where it all looks cool enough to achieve a sufficient wow factor. Then, it’s over, and so is the movie, sort of (there are two gratuitous end-credits scenes), and there’s no payoff to any of it. Blockbuster entertainment is often excused for being empty and mindless amusement, but shouldn’t one based on a video game offer a feeling of mission accomplished? Maybe it’s unfair to view Uncharted as “a video game movie” first and simply a movie second. Should it do more or less, or should we even expect anything different from or excuse it as such for what it is? The movie begins with a logo for PlayStation Productions (the first film under this banner), so it’s hard to go in ignoring its video game connection. What viewers want out of something like this, whether they’re familiar with the games or not, will determine its success level to them. Still, anyone going out to the movies (these days especially) deserves a piece of entertainment that stands out on its own by having memorable moments, main characters who aren’t insufferable, and an ending that satisfies the promise that what has occurred beforehand has meant something.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," Tom Holland does his best to bring his charismatic spark to “Uncharted,” the long-in-the-making movie version of the popular video game, but it’s not enough to power this occasionally amiable but lethargic action-adventure. “Uncharted” isn’t unwatchable but it’s not particularly compelling either. Holland is Nathan Drake, a clever and athletic scammer who’s always looking for the next opportunity to make some easy cash, like the bracelet he pockets from a woman he’s flirting with at the restaurant where he works. But he has never gotten over the disappearance of his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), someone with whom he shared a zeal for old maps, age-of-discovery seafaring and treasure hunting. So when a fellow treasure hunter named Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) shows up in his restaurant with a proposal to find a couple of boatloads of sunken gold from one of Magellan’s voyages and maybe even his brother, Nathan — after some initial skepticism — is all in. Then it’s off to Spain where they are joined by Chloe (Sophia Ali), an old friend of Victor’s who may or may not be on their side, and have to fight off others on the hunt for the gold including rich and evil Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his vicious hireling, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), along with her crew of (inept, of course) thugs. A breezy movie like “Uncharted” hinges on the camaraderie and chemistry between the leads but the one-liners Nathan, Victor and Braddock use with each other mostly fall flat. That leaves the effects which, except for the hanging from the airplane sequences that come at the start and near the end of the film, aren’t particularly dazzling. There’s really nothing here that hasn’t been done before in such movies as “National Treasure.” Director Ruben Fleischer, here working from a script by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, did a much better job of navigating this terrain of adventure, humor and effects with “Zombieland” in 2009 but he has had trouble coming with anything — “Gangster Squad,” “Zombieland: Double Tap” — nearly as engaging since then.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Having become the champion of pandemic cinema with Spider-man: No Way Home, Tom Holland looks to make himself a new franchise in this live action adaptation of the Uncharted video game series.  He plays Nathan Drake, a barman and small-time thief with an encyclopaedic knowledge of history thanks to his missing older brother Sam. He is tracked down by Sully (Mark Wahlberg), an adventurer with a connection to Sam who sees potential in Nathan and offers him a job. The pair are looking to steal an ancient key that will lead them to the lost treasure of voyager Magellan. However, with the ruthless mercenary Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) also looking for the keys on behalf of a wealthy businessman (Antonio Banderas), Nathan must rely on his wits and courage in order to work out who he can trust.  Fans of the Uncharted video game may want to stop reading here, as this adaptation is very loose in a lot of ways. It retains the wit and adventure of the PlayStation series, but shifts in age and characterisation mean this is a different duo. To put it simply: the studio could get Holland and Wahlberg, so they made the rest of the film work around them. What transpires is a madcap series of stunts that rely heavily on the charisma of the leads, and the assumption that you won’t ask too many questions.  There are plenty of holes to pick at. The plot is often too frantic to follow, there is a double cross every couple of minutes, and only Holland comes close to being a character you can root for. However, there’s a pleasant mania to proceedings that are reminiscent of the National Treasure movies (although the script makes several unearned references to Indiana Jones). We’re here for a good time, not a long time, and Holland’s youthful exuberance fits perfectly into the world. He’s happy to flip, punch, and wisecrack his way across Europe, bickering back and forth with Wahlberg in a way that never gets old. Yes, the final aerial chase is ridiculous and overproduced, but this chaotic pair make it easier to swallow.  The rest of the cast are there to snarl and threaten, and nobody does it better than Gabrielle with ice cold delivery and henchmen to spare. Banderas feels detached, while fellow adventurer/love interest Chloe (Sophia Ali) is underdeveloped. However, Uncharted is all about big booms and quick gags as style beats substance into submission. It’s not clever, but it will make you smile. ",NEUTRAL
"Feb 16, 2022"," After nearly a decade and a half in Development Purgatory, the movie adaptation of the popular video game franchise “Uncharted” finally hits big screens — and you’d think that somewhere along that 14-year timeline, they would have remembered to put an actual movie inside the movie. You know how they say some athletes can do it all and excel in every major phase of their particular sport? “Uncharted” is kind of the opposite of that. It tries to do it all but doesn’t stand out in any particular element. Watching this movie is like having a particularly unsatisfying Wordle session. You start off in promising fashion but in a few quick moves, nothing is in the right place. Tom Holland reminds us of his versatility and inherent likability as he slips into the role of Nathan, a gymnastically inclined (hey!), street-smart hustler and bartender who’s pulling off some Tom Cruise-in-“Cocktail” level tricks behind the bar while working his pickpocket game on the upscale clientele. In a scene with strong echoes of the Danny-recruits-Linus opener from “Ocean’s Eleven,” the mysterious Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) pays a visit to Nathan at the bar and tells him if he’d like to take a big step up from copping jewelry and go on a REAL adventure, look him up. Sully wasn’t kidding about the stakes being raised. He’s on the ultimate treasure hunt, looking to recover Ferdinand Magellan’s legendary lost fortune of gold, which went missing some 500 years ago and is the stuff of myth — or is it the stuff of maps? With the help of Nathan, who’s something of an expert in this field, Sully believes he can use the clues from a rare map (and the clues that come in from an unlikely source) to determine the exact location of the treasure. As for why Sully would pluck Nathan seemingly out of nowhere to join him on this “Indiana Jones” of a quest: Sully was working with Nathan’s estranged brother, Sam, who Nathan hasn’t seen since they were both living in an orphanage and Sam had to leave — and never made good on his promise to return for Nathan. Now, if they find the treasure, Nathan just might find Sam as well! With a pair of bejeweled crucifixes literally symbolizing all the double-crossing that transpires along this convoluted journey, Nathan and Sully get into all sorts of death-defying, CGI-requiring, green-screen-heavy adventures, ranging from the slick and relatively grounded to airborne stuff straight out of one of the more ludicrous (or should we say Ludacris) “Fast & Furious” adventures. Antonio Banderas roars like he’s doing Shakespeare in the Park as the standard-issue billionaire villain Santiago Moncado, while Tati Gabrielle’s assassin, Braddock, is such a stone-cold, murdering psychopath, it’s as if she’s a spinoff character from the Hannibal Lecter franchise. Another curious piece of the puzzle that doesn’t quite fit is the character of Chloe Frazier (Sophia Ali), who is out for herself and can’t be trusted but Nathan and Sully have to trust her due to certain circumstances and she has to trust them as well but there’s a lot of talk about how none of them trust each other, cuz ABANDONMENT ISSUES. Given the longtime movie-star status of Wahlberg, and Holland’s undeniable range and skill set, it’s almost baffling how unmemorable they are together. Wahlberg seems particularly half-hearted in his line readings, though in his defense, the snap, crackle and/or pop isn’t really there in the dialogue. “Uncharted” features some gorgeous location shots and some fairly impressive CGI — even when we’re firmly in the land of the ridiculous and Holland’s Nathan is enduring punishment even Spider-Man might not survive. Here is a movie that springs from a video game long hailed for being so cinematic and vibrant — and yet the movie fails to live up to that promising foundation.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 16, 2022"," The Uncharted video game franchise is a lot of fun. The games really make you feel like you’re in the midst of an Indiana Jones-style adventure. They’re about as exciting as gaming gets, with solid stories, to boot. So, a film adaptation certainly had potential. In development for what feels like well over a decade, it’s finally come to fruition. However, the movie opts to be an origin story, aging down protagonist Nathan Drake. It makes financial sense, opting to make it a long-running franchise. Unfortunately, Uncharted has put the cart before the horse, and it’s unlikely that the flick will get a sequel. While never being overtly bad, it’s instantly forgettable and a pale imitation of better adventure tales. You may have an okay time watching it in the moment, but I dare you to remember it once it’s over. Uncharted is, oddly, better when its cast members are bickering back and forth, as opposed to when they’re actually on their quest. Plus, it mostly just reminds you how much more fun it is to play something like this, with just watching it all go down a miscalculation. A passive experience is not what this material is built for. An origin story for an iconic video game character, we’re introduced here to the street-smart Nathan Drake (Tom Holland). Bartending and picking pockets, one day he’s recruited by the seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), hoping to get his help in recovering a fortune hoarded by Ferdinand Magellan and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada. Initially skeptical, Nate is brought around in part by Sully having a relationship with his missing brother Sam. It seems like quick money for the hustler, but as he’ll quickly learn, nothing is going to be easy here. Tom Holland makes his version of Nathan Drake reasonably enjoyable, while Mark Wahlberg is clearly having fun. They’re solid together when they’re just bickering, though neither really does a whole lot with their action sequences. The rest of the cast, including Sophia Ali, Antonio Banderas, and Tati Gabrielle, are pretty much wasted. It’s all about Holland and Wahlberg. Supporting players include  Steven Waddington, but no one really gets much to do. Director Ruben Fleischer is a solid director, but he’s saddled with a mush of a script. A cavalcade of writers (Matt Holloway, Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, Jon Hanley Rosenberg, and Mark D. Walker all have credits) really struggle to introduce Nathan Drake to the big screen. They get the Nathan and Sully banter down decently well, but the adventure itself is muddled, overly complicated, and yet, rather telegraphed. It shouldn’t feel dumb, but Uncharted sure does at times. Fleischer just doesn’t have the style to overcome all of that. Video game adaptations almost never work, but I do feel like we’re getting close. Uncharted is just the latest one to fail, but hope springs eternal. The thing is, filmmakers need to focus on good stories, not material that takes away the fun of participation. When they do that, we’ll have a new day of movies based on games upon us. Uncharted is fine, I suppose. However, we’re right to expect more, given the leads, as well as the potential for a new adventure franchise. So, if you’re a big fan of the games, you might be curious. I know I was. Just keep your expectation in check. Or, better yet, just replay the last few games, which are glorious. This, decidedly, is not.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," Take Uncharted, the new long-in-the-works adaptation of the long-running video-game series, which features a cast filled with beautiful people doing ridiculously dangerous things in exotic locales … but never once rises to the bare-minimum thrill level of “gee, looks fun.” Even during the very expensive climax – which involves duelling helicopters, two massive pirate ships, cannon balls, sword fights, explosions, gunfire and more, more, more! – I struggled to maintain any sort of basic connection to the action on-screen. In the hands of a more skilled, determined and enthusiastic group of filmmakers, I could see how all of Uncharted’s mayhem might be twisted for maximum absurdity. But what director Ruben Fleischer and his many writers (three have final credit, but two more came before) have instead delivered is a straight-faced assault of under-the-top tedium. So, yes, this review is not a recommendation. But I can’t dismiss Uncharted entirely, at least as a curious artifact of how contemporary Hollywood retains a bizarre, utter disdain for its audience. PlayStation-owning fans have long been clamouring for an adaptation of Uncharted, which has cycled through so many filmmakers (Joe Carnahan! Dan Trachtenberg! Travis Knight! David O. Russell!?) that any development news over the past decade and change was treated as something of an inside joke. Somehow and for some reason, producers settled on Fleischer (Zombieland, Venom), who brings his trademark aesthetic of CGI-enabled emptiness to the job, as well as a bruised and battered script that cannot hide the fact that it’s been punched-up so many times around town that it’s now practically comatose. The one thing that Uncharted’s team got right: casting Tom Holland as series lead Nathan Drake, a fortune hunter who is a descendant of English explorer Sir Francis Drake, but is more like the unholy love child of Indiana Jones, Robert Langdon and whoever it was that Orlando Bloom played in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. As written for the screen, Drake is a terribly bland and unskilled hero, his most impressive trait being his habit of saying important plot developments out-loud to no one in particular (“gunpowder!”) and his ability to survive incidents that would kill Superman (or, really, Spider-Man). But just as in his infinitely more impressive Marvel Studios franchise, Holland brings a genuine aw-shucks charm to the proceedings, even when he has to deliver callbacks to far better movies (“Nuns, why does it always have to be nuns?”) and run around like a monkey across a football field’s worth of green screens. Not faring nearly as well is Mark Wahlberg as the more seasoned adventurer Victor Sullivan, who ropes Drake into a scheme to recover a 500-year-old fortune buried in secret by Ferdinand Magellan. Wahlberg, who was once linked to playing Drake himself back when Russell was involved in Uncharted’s early days, could have been wonderful playing an intensely crusty mentor type: think of the actor’s unhinged work in The Departed, or his sweaty passion in any one of Russell’s films (The Fighter, I Heart Huckabees, Three Kings). Here, though, Wahlberg puts on his best actor-tron voice and goes through the robotic motions with something approaching contempt for the material – a defiant choice that he doesn’t quite commit to, sadly, instead landing somewhere between indifference and incompetence. So, what is left in Uncharted to admire beyond Holland, who also earns a demerit mark for not being more discerning in projects between his Spidey gigs? Well, I guess Antonio Banderas has some fun as the movie’s snarling villain, who thinks he has a birthright to Magellan’s gold. But the actor is not on-screen nearly as much as he should be. Maybe Sophia Ali, who plays Drake’s fellow adventurer and sorta love interest Chloe Frazer? But like everyone else, the actress is given the absolutely shoddiest of material to work with. Ultimately, if you absolutely must see Uncharted – perhaps your romantic partner is a big video-game fan, or maybe you just need to get out of the house for one single minute of this infernal pandemic winter, both reasons completely understandable – then I guess see it for a Grade-A example of how old-school Hollywood is determined to run itself into the ground. Or into the sky, carried by helicopters and surrounded by CGI gunfire.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," The new blockbuster film, based on the popular video game series, sees Tom Holland play a swashbuckling treasure hunter alongside Mark Wahlberg. It’s a total bust.  The case of a film inspiring a video game giving birth to another film, Uncharted is an adaptation of Naughty Dog’s excellent Indiana Jones-esque PlayStation series that arrives in theaters following a torturously long development process that began back in 2008. Fourteen years later, the fruits of that labor are meager, as Zombieland director Ruben Fleischer’s action-adventure is a by-the-books treasure-hunting lark that’s been done a million times before and is headlined by a miscast Tom Holland. Like its source material, it’s been modeled after far more illustrious predecessors, the problem being that without the platformer’s interactivity, what’s left is merely a collection of clichés in search of a novel spark. Uncharted begins with a bang, picking up with Nathan Drake (Holland) as he dangles by the foot from one of many tethered-together cargo units that are fluttering in the wind behind a giant plane—a showstopper that directly recalls the memorable centerpiece of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Fortune. Before that death-defying predicament can come to a conclusion, however, Fleischer’s film leaps backwards in time to recount the efforts of young Nathan (Tiernan Jones) and his beloved older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) to steal a museum treasure map that pinpoints the route Magellan took when he discovered, and then hid, a priceless bounty of gold. Sam and Nathan share a dream of finding that loot, but it’s not to be—at least for a while, since once they’re caught by authorities, Sam is booted from the orphanage where they live and, rather than face legal justice, runs away for parts unknown. On his way out a bedroom window, Sam gives Nathan a ring attached to a necklace that boasts their ancestor Sir Frances Drake’s motto, “Sic Parvis Magna” (translation: “Greatness From Small Beginnings”). Yet as with quite a few other narrative elements in Uncharted, it winds up being largely superfluous. Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway’s script obscures plot holes via speed, keeping things moving quickly in an attempt to prevent moviegoers from thinking about sketchy developments, such as Nathan’s third-act procurement—out of the clear blue sky—of a speedboat that’s vital to accomplishing his mission. It’s possible, of course, that such details were simply left on the cutting room floor. Regardless, the film has the feel of a rushed patchwork job, which also extends to the banter shared by a grown Nathan and his unlikely partner-in-crime, Sully (Mark Wahlberg), their repartee straining mightily to generate both humor and a larger sense of their combative camaraderie. Nathan hooks up with Sully in New York City, where the former is working as a bartender, impressing hotties with moves straight out of Cocktail—a nod that, along with the Mission: Impossible-style daredevil opener, suggests some wannabe-Tom Cruise energy. Sully appears in Manhattan because he and Sam had been working together to acquire Magellan’s fortune, and now that Sam is dead—supposedly—he needs Nathan’s help to complete the quest. Luckily, despite having no apparent skills aside from twirling liquor bottles and pilfering jewelry from unsuspecting marks, Nathan is more than up to the task. Though he’s skeptical of Sully—a shady wisecracker whom Wahlberg imbues with shrugging cockiness—he accepts this daring assignment because he believes it’ll reunite him with Sam, who for the past decade-and-a-half has been sending him postcards from various spots around the world. Thus begins an odyssey that pits Nathan and Sully against Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a member of the very family that Magellan betrayed centuries earlier, and a ruthless businessman who hungrily covets the gold. Central to locating that plunder are two crosses that function as keys, one of which is at an auction that Nathan and Sully crash, and the other is in the possession of Chloe (Sophia Ali), a former Sully ally who cautions Nathan against trusting his new comrade. Uncharted strives to keep Sully’s good/evil nature in question until its climax, yet Wahlberg doesn’t hold up his end of the bargain, his turn too good-humored to sell the idea that Sully might actually be a nefarious villain. Worse, his performance feels tossed-off, which is also true of Holland’s leading-man routine. Coming across like a superhuman boy in a grown-up game—replete with multiple instances in which he evades trouble by Spidey-spring-boarding off a wall—he’s a bad fit for Nathan, generically stout when he should be rugged and roguish. All the while, Fleischer and company indulge in every genre trope they can imagine, from secret doorways, hidden compartments and cobwebby passageways to mysterious puzzles, land-sea-air showdowns and a handful of double-crosses by would-be allies. Somewhere lurking within Uncharted is a flicker of romance, but unlike Holland’s Spider-Man extravaganzas, Fleischer’s film can’t be bothered to humanize its characters with anything approaching engaging emotions or relations; the sole thing that matters is racing from one subterranean catacomb and buried cave to the next, the action punctuated by a few dull quips and some brooding over MIA relatives. Overt references to Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean only exacerbate the photocopied quality of the proceedings, making one pine for those superior forerunners rather than this pale imitation. Compounding matters further is the fact that, in Banderas, Uncharted has a regal star with first-hand experience with swashbuckling adventure (i.e. The Mask of Zorro). Rather than taking advantage of the accomplished actor’s familiarity with such shenanigans, however, Fleischer relegates Banderas to a suavely sneering archetype whose prime purpose is to fume at his father’s intended philanthropy and order around a bunch of henchmen—led by lethal mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle)—to kill Nathan and Sully and retrieve his rightful property. Even if it’s nice to see Banderas cashing in on his past glory in a big-budget studio outing, it’s depressing that the vehicle in question is so raggedy, devoid of any globetrotting glamour or breakneck suspense. The faster it plummets down its path, the more Uncharted proves schematic in every respect, a flat programmer lacking a fresh twist. And without a controller at the ready to let one take command of such standard swinging-punching-shooting-swimming mayhem, the result is a last-gen title rendered in two dimensions.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," Fans of video games know the story all too well: Their beloved franchise’s where they’ve spent hours upon hours unpacking and sorting while coasting on Red Bull at two o’clock in the morning finally get the live action treatment and there’s a glimmer of hope it might be somewhat decent only to crash and burn. Needless to say, adaptations based on popular games don’t have a good track record, so one might approach Ruben Flesicher’s “Uncharted” with a sense of apprehension and for good reason. How could a series that already felt like a cinematic experience translate to the big screen? The results aren’t as bad as one might assume thanks to the charisma of its lead star Tom Holland who is stepping away from the spidey suit momentarily to try and find a vehicle worthy of his talents. “Cherry” and “Chaos Walking” were disasters for Holland and considering “Uncharted” is passively watchable thanks to its gritty “Sahara” meets “National Treasure” vibes, it’s already one of the better video game adaptations by default because it at least tries to have fun even if you’d rather go home and play the games instead.  Holland plays Nate Drake, a young pickpocketer who uses his day job as a bartender to try and steal from wealthy trust fund clientele. Though this wasn’t a sublot explored in the games, it’s a nice bit of worldbuilding as it pertains to the introduction of Mark Wahlberg’s Victor “Sully” Sullivan, another beloved character from the game though here he’s much younger. (Someone more akin to Bruce Campbell could have done wonders in this role). Sully, a world renowned artifact collector and thief, lures Nate from his mundane lifestyle to the big leagues where dangerous foreign adversaries (say hello to the campiest version of Antonio Banderas who understood what was being asked of him) shoot first and ask questions later, but the haul is worth billions in gold.  Double crosses and alliances shift throughout the film (don’t even try to keep track) as Nate and Sully go on a globe-trotting adventure to track down an ancient treasure with plenty of puzzles and Indiana Jones-like booby traps popping up along the way. Fleischer, who directed “Venom” and “Zombieland,” keeps the tempo moving fast enough between sequences so the audience can’t stop and think about the corny dialogue or rough patch of green screen locales. The camera work isn’t particularly thrilling either, but Holland utilizes his dexterity (and spidey background) to parkour around a few national landmarks with a breezy pep in his step whereas Whalberg harbors the stereotypical: “I’m getting to old for this” schtick (though apparently Sully isn’t old enough for Tinder).  Regardless, nobody is expecting much from “Uncharted” and perhaps those basement level expectations opened the door for me to be slightly amused at several crafty brawls (one inside a lavish auction gala early in the film sparkles with energy). Plus, as a fan, picking apart the fun little nods and easter eggs of the games was a nifty treasure hunt on its own. Still, Holland, bless him, can’t handle the tougher emotional beats required of the role and part of that belongs to the five credited screenwriters (yes, five) who struggle to tap into the foundation of what made the games as fun as they were. Of course, “Uncharted” is being teed-up as the inaugural addition in a possible franchise (I loath when films put their cart in front of the horse like this) with two post-credit scenes to tease the next installment. Though I wouldn’t hate another go around with these characters on the big screen, especially as Holland and Wahlberg aren’t completely dreadful, let’s hope the narrative doesn’t get marooned in uncharted waters. ",NEGATIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," It’s well into the third act of “Uncharted,” during the airborne pirate ship battle, that I began to wonder: who on Earth are these people? Of course, we know their names, and what they’re doing — Mark Wahlberg is Victor “Sully” Sullivan, Tom Holland  is his young protégé, Nathan Drake, and they’re on a globe-trotting adventure to find a treasure trove of gold stashed by Magellan’s crew, and perhaps Nathan’s long-lost brother, but really, who are they? What do they actually want (aside from gold)? How did Sully’s profession become pillaging the pillagers? We know how Nathan got here and what he wants, as the young pickpocket/flair bartender  who  has been recruited by Sully for his very specific set of skills, and his connection to his missing treasure hunting  brother, Sam. Everyone else in this adventure seems to be there for nebulously greedy reasons that are never fully explained. Sully and Nathan’s partner, a vaguely Britishy Daria type, Chloe (Sophia Ali), claims a childhood betrayal as her driving force. The glamorous assassin Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) hired to stalk and stop them is seemingly in it for the money, but the one opportunity for her character to have a juicier storyline is quickly squandered. The only clearly outlined character is Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), a Spanish aristocrat descended from conquistadors who wants to repatriate the gold that Ferdinand Magellan’s men stole from the Philippines, oh so many centuries ago. Every other character seems to be along for the ride to simply to test out the limitations of their performance cargo khakis. Familiarity with the lore of “Uncharted,” the video game, should not have to be a prerequisite to invest in the lore of “Uncharted,” the movie, though it’s likely that die-hard fans of the game might be a bit disappointed with this iteration. The journey of “Uncharted” from PlayStation console to screen is about as epic as the adventures the central characters undertake. The film has been in development since 2008, and various directors and actors have come and gone through the process. Finally, the combination of director Ruben Fleischer and star Tom Holland stuck, with a script by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway. The story feels inspired by early Hollywood serials, and Fleischer throws Nathan into extreme-sports inspired scenarios with ticking clocks that are the same stuff that action filmmaking has been made of since Pauline was in peril. But while “Uncharted” should be a rip-roaring adventure, it neither rips nor roars. Instead, it’s a rather basic travelogue through various far-flung locations, filled with riddles, puzzles, symbols, keys and historical fun facts, like a “Da Vinci Code” with abs. If “Uncharted” survives on one thing, it’s the charming banter between Holland and Wahlberg. While Holland is a bit youthful for the role, he’s in a fun zone as a naughtier, zippier version of his Queens-born city kid Peter Parker. He’s matched by Wahlberg, who is locked in his signature high-pitched/rapid fire, “say hi to ya’ mother for me” cadence. The pair are so entertaining to watch that it’s a letdown when Holland interacts with anyone else. “Uncharted” is fine, and entertaining enough, but while some moments are inspired, others are completely inert. It’s oddly neutered and bloodless, the stakes negligible. It feels like a project with so much potential that never fully achieves liftoff, stumbling when it should soar.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 16, 2022"," Naughty Dog are some of the best storytellers in gaming, and the Uncharted series has often been referred to as films on rails because their games are so cinematic. The gameplay is great too, but it’s the story and presentation that sets them in a class of their own. The Uncharted film is anything but that. The action adventure film is perfectly content with recreating various moments from the games but lacks most of character and charm they have. It’s a soulless clone that lands with little impact. Why watch the film when you’re better of playing, or even just watching, the games themselves. Uncharted tells the origins of the adventures of Nathan Drake and Victor “Sully” Sullivan, played by Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg. Sully is a treasure hunter and is looking for the biggest score of his life. He enlists the help of a young Nate, whose proclivity for history and pick-pocketing  make him a suitable partner. Together they will scour globe in search of Magellan’s expedition that is rumored to hold $5 billion in gold on it. They’re not the only ones looking for it, however, as Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) is hot on the trail too and will go to any means to get it. It’s a race to discover the clues left behind by the famed explorer and be the first to discover the treasure. The first and biggest thing wrong with Uncharted is how terribly miscast both Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg are as Nate and Sully. Both of them are fine actors and action heroes, but they just do not fit their roles. Uncharted has been in development for more than 10 years and has gone through multiple changes in that time, with Wahlberg even set to star as Nate at one point before ultimately decided to do an origin story of sorts and skew everyone younger so a franchise can be built off Tom Holland. By doing that, they eliminate all of the chemistry and core relationships that make the games so fantastic. In the games, Nate and Sully are longtime partners who have been through thick and thin together but always manage to escape no matter how dire the situation might be. Sully’s intelligence and level-headedness pairs perfectly with Nate’s gung-ho attitude. The film forgoes all of this entirely, showcasing a more combative dynamic where nobody can trust anyone except for themselves. It makes a little sense given that this is their introduction, but it’s not Uncharted except in name. Tom Holland can quip and joke all his wants, but he never truly captures the bravado and charisma of Nathan Drake. They all put on a decent enough performance for an Indiana Jones or Goonies clone but they never manage to escape from being just another generic copy. And yes, the Uncharted games started out as a clone of Indiana Jones, but it was able to carve out its own place in the adventure genre. There’s nothing about the film that sets it apart, however. Audiences unfamiliar with the source material may get a kick out of some fun action sequences and a few humorous quips, but fans of the franchise will ultimately be let down. It’s unfortunate because the film has all the building blocks of the games; the history lessons, the artifacts and clues, the generic bad guys who are always one step behind the heroes. There are even action sequences that are pulled directly from them as well. The iconic cargo moment from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception is recreated beautifully, as is the daring auction encounter for Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. These scenes all look fantastic, but they carry no weight to them. Uncharted is merely a compilation of some of Nathan Drake’s most exciting moments stitched together haphazardly with little attention given to actually exploring who Drake and Sully are. It says something about Uncharted when some of the most enjoyment I got out of it was when it was referencing the game, like when it shows a Naughty Dog sticker on a suitcase or when Nolan North, Drake’s voice actor in the video games, makes a cameo appearance. Uncharted falls of the rails the games so-easily set up. It’s possible that potential sequels could catch up to the games and deliver the dynamic expected of the franchise, but after suck a lackluster debut on the big screen, I’m not entirely sure it’s worth the wait. Naughty Dog are some of the best storytellers in gaming, and the Uncharted series has often been referred to as films on rails because their games are so cinematic. The gameplay is great too, but it’s the story and presentation that sets them in a class of their own. The Uncharted film is anything but that.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Like many of Naughty Dog’s other video game properties, Uncharted wears its cinematic influences on its sleeves. Modeled after the Indiana Jones films, the exploits of treasure hunter Nathan Drake have been so clearly designed to feel like playable movies that they render the long-gestating film adaptation, directed by Ruben Fleischer, at best redundant and at worst a step down from its source material. With interactivity removed from the equation, this Uncharted essentially plays out like a series of cutscenes. One of the more distinctive aspects of the games is that Nathan is middle-aged, and as such has carried with him the experience of a lifetime of his grueling adventures. The film, though, doesn’t reach for the elegiac, as it serves as an origin story, and a distinctly Hollywoodized one at that. Here we come to know Nathan (Tom Holland) as a young adult being introduced to treasure hunting by a seasoned pro, Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), who’s also been de-aged for this film and as such sapped of some of the gravitas that comes with life. Holland’s Nathan feels like any other franchise protagonist of the modern moment, and if anything this Uncharted frames his knowledge of history as preternatural rather than something that was carefully gained over a long period of time and through reasoned inquiry. He also lacks the comfort level with Sully that defined their rapport in the video games, with the film replacing the banter that teems with shared, unspoken history with the sort of dreary, quip-heavy humor that has become a standard of blockbuster screenwriting. Sully recruits Nathan to help him find a treasure that was hidden by members of Magellan’s 16th-century expedition around the world, and those familiar with Uncharted will recognize the broad outlines of the plot and how it progresses: The pair, along with fellow treasure seeker Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), traverse the world combing through ancient landmarks and hidden chambers, looking for clues that will lead them to a treasure trove of gold. In sharp contrast to the games, which wouldn’t be the same without the consideration they put into parsing notes and solving puzzles, the film doesn’t paint a charming, or patient, picture of the art of sleuthing. Nathan uses his power of deductive reasoning to figure out each mystery almost as quickly as it arises. Similarly, the action moves swiftly through its locales. Only Barcelona, where the characters must traverse church catacombs that snake through the city’s underbelly, feels like it plays an actual role in the story, but even here the action is so rushed that you feel no sense of wonder for history and all the secrets that it contains. The film devotes most of its time to its characters in peril, as well as to a dizzying number of double-crosses among them. But the action is resolutely unintelligible, often playing out as a mishmash of close-ups of limbs and weapons. More weird, though, than this unintentionally vertiginous sense of movement is the intended showstoppers and their conspicuous lack of grandiosity, especially one set piece, a mid-air frenzy of flying cargo and falling bodies, that blatantly lifts one of the games’ definitive moments, only without the escalating absurdity. The games are fixated on the idea of honor among thieves, but you wouldn’t know that from the antic, meaningless depiction of the betrayals that play out across the film. What was once a carefully paced series of blindsides becomes a flurry of reversals not only between the main players but also their rivals, in this case Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), the descendant of a Medici-esque family whose blood-soaked history has ties to the Magellan expedition, and his henchwoman, Jo (Tati Gabrielle), who also shares a past with Sully. With everyone constantly turning on one another, no room is made for real characterization. Even Nathan, the star of the show, is exactly the same person at the end as he is when he’s first introduced. In many respects, Uncharted feels less cinematic than its source material, lacking the games’ interest in their lore and environments or watching characters grow by confronting their assumptions and biases. In the end, there’s no meaningful distinction here between the greed of the ostensible heroes and that of the villains, which could have made for cutting critique were the film itself not so beguiled by the intoxicating allure of ill-gotten treasure.

"Feb 16, 2022"," But the big-budget film, based on the popular PlayStation video game franchise of the same name, isn’t the unmitigated disaster its inconspicuous mid-February release date or negative early buzz suggests it could be. As far as these types of movies go, “Uncharted” is fine. Nothing more, nothing less. Fresh off “Spider-Man: No Way Home,” Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, the legendary treasure hunter from the video game but who in the film starts off as a kid who grew up studying Magellan and breaking into museums with his brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow). Cut to 15 years later when Nate is working as bartender/pickpocket in New York City and he’s recruited by seasoned swashbuckler Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), his future mentor in the video game, to help him find Magellan’s stolen treasure and possibly Sam, who has suddenly disappeared. First on their to-do list: steal an ancient artifact and literal key to unlocking the mystery of the treasure’s location from a heavily secured auction house. Standing in their way are the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), who believes the treasure is his birthright, and his lethal associate, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, Netflix’s “You”). The heist scene is, again, fine. But it’s also when you start to feel a sense of déjà vu that sticks with you throughout the film. “Uncharted,” directed by Ruben Fleischer (”Venom”), borrows heavily from both “National Treasure” and “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,” particularly when the action moves to Barcelona where Nate and Sully are joined in their quest by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, Amazon Prime Video’s “The Wilds”), who is essentially a grungier version of Elsa Schneider. Even the film’s most exciting action sequence, the airlifting of two of Magellan’s ships over the Banda Sea, feels like something out of a yet-to-be-made “Fast and Furious” pirate movie. Hit me up if you’re interested, Vin. Excessive recycling isn’t its only offense. Treasure films are fun because of the puzzle-solving involved. The answers here, however, come way too easily. It’s as if the clues were left by the proprietor of the escape room in your local mall and not highly motivated 16th-century pirates sitting on $5 billion worth of gold. But perhaps more egregious, besides Holland’s Nate, every character is one-dimensional. Backstories are eluded to then tossed aside. It’s like they were, gulp, written for a video game. Not all of it is bad. The action is indeed often thrilling, if not familiar and mindless, and the cast does its best to elevate the material they’ve been given. Holland is in full Peter Parker mode, bringing his signature boyish charm and risk-taking spirit to Nate. Wahlberg acts as if he’s having the time of his life. I’d see more (but different) movies with these two. Banderas is menacing as ever in his role, which, unfortunately, doesn’t amount to much more than a cameo. Gabrielle, in her feature film debut, steals every scene she’s in. Fans of the video game should get a kick out of a brief appearance by a certain actor. Are there worse ways to spend two hours in the dead of winter than “Uncharted”? Yes. Does the film actually venture into any uncharted territory that other action-adventure-treasure movies before it haven’t already?

"Feb 16, 2022"," Of all of Sony's hit PlayStation franchises that could transcend different mediums, Uncharted immediately stands out as the one that seems the most adaptable. Treasure hunts and daring heists have played out across screens both big and at home for long enough now that all it would take for Uncharted to make the jump is to slot the existing characters and references into their respective places, and for the most part, that's what this new live-action Uncharted movie does. It marries established characters with a recognizable cast and will probably be better at attracting new Uncharted fans compared to appealing to the diehards, but it's a fun, lighthearted time overall. Uncharted casts Tom Holland as Nathan ""Nate"" Drake, a treasure hunter known from the Uncharted games for his rugged charm, witty banter, and resourcefulness. Nate's more of an opportunist and a pickpocket than a worldly adventurer at the start of the film, at least until he's recruited by Mark Wahlberg's character, Sully, who coaxes Nate with the allure of treasure and a reunion with Nate's older brother, Sam. As anyone who's seen a treasure-focused movie might've guessed, they're far from the only ones after the score.  This movie serves as a prequel of sorts, given that it depicts a younger Nate than we're accustomed to, a direction which was actually executed well by mixing familiar game moments with an introductory storyline to start every viewer off on a more even footing. But even if people didn't know Holland as Spider-Man first and Nate second, third, or even fourth, it's difficult to view him as Nate throughout the movie. Holland makes for an excellent adventurer and could depict a superb treasure hunter named anything other than ""Nathan Drake,"" but Nate's adventures are well documented by now, which means it was always going to be a big task to fill his shoes. Still, Holland's got an impeccable grasp on Nate's humor, has boundless energy for the role. He bounces off Mark Wahlberg well, but Wahlberg's even further from Sully than Holland is from Nate with precious little of the mentor character's personality surviving the jump to film. Sophia Ali as the established Chloe Frazer and Tati Gabrielle as newcomer Braddock, by comparison, dominated their roles and commanded most scenes they were in. Chloe's had her own adventures independent of Nate's in the games, and if the same happened with Ali as Chloe in a spinoff, there'd be no complaints. There's a briskness to Uncharted's story reminiscent of smashing through cutscene dialogue as the good and bad guys are ferried around in a game of cat and mouse. Most plot pivotal moments and twists are either predictable or unsurprising, but that doesn't take away much from the film given how well-trodden the treasure hunting genre is already. What shines throughout the film is the choreography of the fights and bigger stunts. Holland's comedy translates to Nate's personality well by recognizing the absurdity of the situations he finds himself in, be that hurtling out of a plane or scrapping with a towering Scotsman, and it's during those moments that it's most believable we're watching a young Nate become more worldly by the second. When Nate's resourcefulness and Holland's banter intertwine – and they do often enough to make note of – it's during those moments that it does feel like we're seeing Nate on the big screen. The tumbling plane scene advertised so often takes inspiration directly from Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, but even beyond that, the movie's most memorable segments have a unique grasp of video game logic and what makes those replayable moments tick. Are they ridiculous and improbable? Sure, but they wouldn't be nearly as much fun otherwise. They don't leave you much time to ponder dubious outcomes or plot armor and instead segue you from one puzzle or brawl to the next, but it's hard to imagine any other direction working to the degree that tempo does. By the time the treasure trot starts wrapping things up, it's much easier to see – or at least see the start of – most of the cast merging with their respective characters. The faithfulness to some of the most recognizable looks is particularly appreciated and makes for great ""a-ha!"" moments for even the most casual of Uncharted fans. That's probably who'll enjoy this film the most; those who played one or two games in the series and could pick Nathan out of a lineup of protagonists but aren't invested enough to get hung up on inconsistencies. For those uninitiated to Uncharted, let Holland be your Nate and shelve this movie next to your Pirates of the Caribbean and Indiana Jones collections. The more fervent fans may never see their favorite characters translated as well as they'd like, but we'll almost certainly be getting more movies after this one, so it's best to look at Uncharted the same way it views itself – not too seriously.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2022"," rowing up in an orphanage together, Sam Drake imparts his love of exploration and artifact-hunting onto his younger brother Nathan. When Sam’s continued larceny finds him facing imprisonment, he’s forced to abscond. Years later, Nathan (Tom Holland) has grown up, but hasn’t lost his love for mischief and pilferage. When a more experienced “acquisitions specialist,” Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), approaches Nathan with information about both his long-lost brother and the long-lost riches of famed explorer Ferdinand Magellan, Drake is thrust into a race against time and competitors – ranging from fellow fortune seeker Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) to ruthless financier Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his hired army of mercenaries, led by the murderous Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Despite a few blaring differences – namely the ages of Drake and Sully compared to their polygonal counterparts – “Uncharted” accomplishes what few game-to-film adaptations can tout: faithfully simulating the source material. The look and feel of the film are ripped straight from game company Naughty Dog’s highly revered quadrilogy. While the plot finds the questers globetrotting to slightly different locations in pursuit of slightly different trinkets, their journey emulates almost identically the adventure the player behind the controller would experience. Invincible protagonists, increasingly difficult henchmen, vividly reminiscent environments, and escalating fantasy action sequences mimic the games with surprising accuracy. Even Wahlberg and Holland’s performances offer an impressively sincere recreation of the game duo’s verbal jousting and camaraderie. Yet the film’s perplexing desire to change key – though ultimately trivial – plot points and character interactions from what the games established will undoubtedly cause consternation among diehard fans. But the ensuing adventure still retains the humor and excitement most endearing to the franchise. The irony lies in the fact that while the video games broke ground by allowing consumers a chance to play in a game that feels like a movie, the reverse is a movie that feels like a video game – a concept that isn’t exactly fresh in the world of cinema. The sense of gameplay fun isn’t an easy concept to translate to the big screen – there are no characters here to manipulate; viewers are instead at the mercy of the equivalent of two-hours of non-interactive cutscenes. This is never more apparent than with the cold open, which works to elaborate upon one of the greatest of all airplane stunts, originally seen in “The Living Daylights,” in which characters grapple and dangle from cargo netting. But without the luxury of players specifically navigating their captive alter-ego through pause-able tussles and goals, this sequence is simply too steeped in computer graphics and models to impart any realism or tension. It’s ludicrously over-the-top. Ultimately, since controlling someone else’s actions through fantasy scenarios isn’t possible, the result is a prominent lack of originality; from the orphaned troublemakers, to the mysterious man offering a ticket out of mediocrity, to familial estrangement, to the overly knowledgable hotshot with a very specific interest in Magellan, to a total absence of restraint before heading off on a worldwide adventure with a complete stranger, “Uncharted’s” premise incorporates every component necessary for a terribly generic actioner. Even the subplots, motives, backstories, antagonists, love interests, and snappy gibes are frightfully commonplace. And when puzzles are brought up, referencing the video game, they’re strangely unsatisfying; audiences aren’t a part of their solving, which means they’re not of much use as a tool for amplifying suspense or thrills. In fact, most of them are dull and unspecific, augmented by mystifying coincidences (such as how complex machinery would still be operable centuries after disuse). Plus, the successes or failures of the lead characters are never of much consequence; they’re all utterly unconquerable, with devil-may-care attitudes amid perilous interactions that pose no believable threats. It certainly doesn’t help that they’re also morally indistinguishable from the villains – going so far as to switch sides regularly – displaying a duplicitousness that makes them all tremendously unlikable. The best of them are mere thieves, while the worst leave their accomplices to die; this assortment of booty searchers is entirely untrustworthy and undependable, making the continued, fragile alliances even more disappointing when they expectedly fall apart. There are intermittent nods to Indiana Jones, but no favorable recreations in tone or action or character designs; the exhilaration of archaeology, as so famously manufactured by that fedora-adorned adventurer, is nowhere to be found here. No matter how faithful to the source material “Uncharted” may be, it doesn’t equate to a competent adventure film.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Tom Holland the laws of physics both take a licking and keep on ticking in “Uncharted,” Sony’s big screen adaptation of the Sony video game starring Sony’s Spider-Man.  Holland’s kinetic turn as the young pickpocket/historian and bartender turned adventurer is emphatic proof that it’s not just digital effects and stuntmen in that spider suit. “Uncharted” co-stars Mark Wahlberg as the guy who might have “the key” to Magellan’s lost treasure, but who was probably cast because he’s one of two action stars who doesn’t tower over the diminutive Brit leading man. (The other? JCVD.) Yes, there are billions in gold that the Portuguese explorer working for Spain Ferdinand Magellan found and didn’t live long enough to bring home in history’s first circumnavigation of the globe. No, the gold part isn’t true, but never mind. When he was little, Nate Drake and his older brother Sam dreamed of tracking it down. But being orphans in Boston, fat chance of that. Sam went off on his own in his teens. Nate, the younger sibling “with pirate blood” (they think they’re descended from the first British circumnavigator, Sir Francis Drake) went to New York and mastered the light fingers that get the attention of Victor Sullivan (Wahlberg).  Actually, he knew about the kid because he met his brother. Now, he’s out to steal this golden crucifix that doubles as the key to the lost treasure. Sullivan needs a hustling, ballsy pickpocket who can hold his liquor so that they can split the $5 billion allegedly buried inside whatever those keys unlock. The complications are the heir to an ancient Spanish banking dynasty (Antonio Banderas unleashes his perfect growl), his treacherously sexy lieutenant (Tati Gabrielle) and the equally athletic, self-serving and sexy Spanish “partner” (Sophia Ali) in Nate and Vincent’s enterprise.  It begins with a “falling out of a cargo plane” set piece that we get back to later. Holland’s Nate battles gravity, and logic, and wins. Bugs Bunny Physics at its finest. And that’s not even the finale. But damn, is this movie stupid and dull or what? The plot is cut-and-pasted from a half dozen other movies. Every line is more banal than the one that preceded it. A good example, the billionaire banker never travels anywhere without his vintage Mercedes 300 Gullwing. He takes the time, as it’s loaded on the cargo plane, to tell a minion “Be sure not to scratch it.” Holland is perky enough, but the may be the most sexless role of his generally neutered career. And Wahlberg, without a good script, funny lines or a great director to insist he raise his game, only occasionally achieves “adequate.” There’s nothing wrong with popcorn pictures that blend history and action, even if the history is bent beyond recognition and the action is as implausible a Bugs Bunny or Captain Jack Sparrow cartoon. “Video games make lousy movies” has been a truism since SEGA, and while there have been nearly tolerable exceptions, “Uncharted” isn’t one of them. And Holland may very well do a lot of his own stunts, but he’d be better served picking his own scripts. ",NEGATIVE

"Feb 16, 2022"," Tom Holland is a busy man these days. He wrapped his newest film ""Uncharted,"" an adaptation of the popular video game series, a scant few days before beginning work on ""Spider-Man: No Way Home,"" the biggest film of the last year. In interviews, he spoke about how difficult it was to shake off the ""swagger"" of his new character, Nathan Drake, when returning to the awkward shoes of the friendly neighborhood Peter Parker, suggesting, to the contrary of most viewers' assumptions, that he has more range than playing boyish, clumsy, but lovable protagonists. The mere suggestion of his work on ""Uncharted"" being that much of a change of pace from the role that made him a household name implied we might be about to witness a new gear for Holland, a new set of tricks. But anyone hoping for a drastic divergence from the screen persona he just can't seem to shake should temper their expectations. When one finds themselves tired of ""vanilla,"" ""French vanilla"" only goes so far. An adaptation of the ""Uncharted"" games has been in development hell for the last 15 years, with an endless list of writers and directors swapping in and out trying to find the right angle on Nathan Drake and his exploits as a ragtag fortune hunter. This probably has to do with the fact that the source material is itself a playful pastiche on a variety of adventure movies, so porting that set of ideas back to the medium that spawned it is difficult without devolving into open thievery of other, better flicks. It's been fretted over long enough for Mark Wahlberg to age out of playing Drake himself, but not so long that he's truly old enough for his current role as Drake's mentor Sully.  Enter Holland as a younger take on the hero, in an origin story of sorts that sees him under the wing of a grizzled veteran he has two hours worth of awkward banter with. If that sounds too much like Peter Parker and Tony Stark, that's an unfortunate truth, because Holland, Wahlberg, director Ruben Fleischer, and everyone else involved sure tried their damnedest to make ""Uncharted"" its own self-sustaining vehicle. But over a decade of rewrites and a big budget funding brash action set pieces isn't enough to shake the sense that you're watching an AU where Spider-Man is trapped in the Holodeck acting out Indiana Jones cosplay. 
""Uncharted"" is another one in a long line of comic book and video game adaptations where healthy knowledge of the source material is only necessary to understand Easter eggs, as the core story itself feels like a whole cloth creation grafted to the general iconography of what it's based upon. Holland stars as Nathan Drake, but rather than the gruff-looking everyman with a storied career as a fortune hunter, he's a baby-faced youth grifting rich marks out of their valuables while moonlighting as a bartender. Then he meets Wahlberg's Sully and gets whisked away on a journey to find Magellan's long-lost ships and all the gold allegedly inside them. It's a simple setup designed to do what so much modern exploitation of IP has done before it: tell a story that teases thirsty viewers for the one they actually paid for.





On the surface, there's nothing inherently wrong with making a glorified ""Uncharted"" prequel, de-aging the principal characters and showing the foundational journal Nathan Drake embarked upon to become the beloved figure he is in all the games that inspired this film. But there's something to the shoddy construction of the film's script, its bargain bin dialogue with faux-charming banter and the general sense that none of this matters. That's because it all feels like little more than setup for a franchise that may or may not happen. 
It may feel unfair to criticize this movie for simply following in the footsteps of most movies nowadays, but the original blockbuster boom happened because there were big spectacle films that enticed audiences so much they wanted more, and studios went out and made more. There is a difference between going out to eat a full meal so good it warrants a second helping and being served small plates designed to make you hungry enough for a main course that may never come. Films like ""Uncharted"" that stitch together enough touchstones from the IP they're based upon to market what amounts to little more than vaporware to fans feel like feature-length teasers, and the more the marketplace becomes dominated by them, the harder it is to muster up the gumption to care.





The superhero movie boom has made the ""origin story"" paradigm too attractive to avoid. So much so that in lieu of engaging stakes and resonant emotional beats, moviegoers who pay for a ticket to ""Uncharted"" can look forward to things like Nathan Drake putting on his signature gun holster for the first time, or tongue-in-cheek jokes about Wahlberg finally growing Sully's iconic mustache. It renders all the efforts of the story that precedes these cheap pops meaningless, because we all know the story exists as a framework to deliver these moments, and little else.

Before getting even more negative about this admittedly watchable, admittedly tolerable example of what passes for a motion picture these days, it would be impolite not to at least highlight the few positives ""Uncharted"" offers.





Firstly, for a director who has failed upwards as often as ""Zombieland"" helmer Ruben Fleischer has, it's genuinely thrilling to see the energy and excitement he and his team put into the film's set pieces. The airborne climax of the film, split between a gripping introductory scene and its actual chronological placement in the narrative, makes up for what it lacks in grit and texture with a truly inspired sense of joy. At its best, ""Uncharted"" calls to mind Gore Verbinski's work on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" trilogy, tapping into a raw, swashbuckling sense of adventure. 
The supporting cast is also pretty lovely. It's always fun to see Antonio Banderas exert an unnecessary amount of thespian effort when playing sociopathic villains in action films, dating all the way back to his underrated work in ""Assassins."" But here he delivers a taciturn performance as a tortured, rich megalomaniac that feels like it's from an experimental character study and not a video game movie. Ditto Tati Gabrielle, doing a sterling impression of Ruth Negga as the film's heavy, Jo Braddock, and Sophia Ali as popular Drake foil Chloe Sullivan, who both make the most of their meager roles.





And in terms of the film's praises to be sung, Ramin Djawadi delivers a pretty strong original score. 
But at the top of the card, the two headliners just don't feel like the right fits for this feature. Wahlberg is already an actor with a pretty limited range, and in throwaway action flicks, he has a higher batting average when he's playing off of the right scene partner (Denzel Washington in ""2 Guns,"" Lou Diamond Philips in ""The Big Hit."") Thrust into the obligatory ""Mr. Stark"" role as young Drake's conflicted and untrustworthy mentor, Wahlberg's presence would probably wring more drama and interest if his chemistry with Holland didn't feel so fake and cutesy. It's the focal point of the biggest thing holding the film back, and that's Holland's casting.
His physicality is definitely welcome, as the parkour/wall crawling agility his dancer's background has blessed him with gives his fight scenes an Errol Flynn-esque flair. But it only serves to further highlight the strange Spider-Man-ification of an otherwise completely unrelated property simply by virtue of sharing a leading man who is unable to do more than one distinct thing onscreen.
Is it any different than the '80s when every spec script would have to be retrofitted to contort around Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger's bulging frames and super narrow ranges? Well, no. Not really. So long as you're comfortable with accepting that the mainstream marketplace's best box office draw is a sweethearted kid who always looks like he really misses his dad, Holland showing up as Spider-Man in more Spider-Man movies and even other non-Spider-man related films should be cause for celebration.





At this rate, it might be all Sony has left in the tank.

"Feb 16, 2022"," Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A treasure hunter walks into a Papa John’s franchise in the middle of beautiful Barcelona. He’s there to unlock a complicated puzzle in the hopes of getting one step closer to finding the gold lost during the epic journey of Ferdinand Magellan 500 years prior. The man is Victor “Sully” Sullivan, played by Mark Wahlberg, who appears to be going through the motions without any real fun or excitement, just like this movie. It’s a given with modern blockbusters that product placements will happen, but this isn’t like James Bond driving around in a Jaguar. A major action set piece in this film is set in an exotic locale yet still stuck in America’s worst pizza chain. It would be like if Spielberg shot Indiana Jones’ famous shootout from Raiders inside Egypt’s finest Orange Julius. It’s a flagrant use of corporate sponsorship that adds nothing to the story and embarrasses everyone involved. The rest of Uncharted, a sort-of prequel to the popular action-adventure video game series from Naughty Dog, is competently made and has a few moments of inspiration, which makes it the Citizen Kane of video game adaptations by default. Director Ruben Fleischer, who knew how to have some big-budget fun with Zombieland, brings his journeyman bonafide to this one, but can’t give the film the epic grandeur needed for a fun adventure. He even wastes the talents of Park Chan-wook’s longtime DP, Chung-hoon Chung, Uncharted shot either in close-ups or the characters are surrounded by screensaver-level vistas.  The script, written by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway, also doesn’t do anyone any favors here with a plot that works too much like the video games. The treasure-hunting crew must get Object A (Magellan’s gold) but before they get that, they need Object B (A random tree in Barcelona) but before they get that, they need Object C (A bedazzled cross from the 16th Century). This kind of plotting works when playing a goal-oriented video game where you can complete side-quests or collect items to keep things interesting, but when a film leans into this kind of deliberate plotting, it comes off like watching a PlayStation game cutscene instead of experiencing a story.  The exceptions are two standout sequences that come too late to make a big difference. The first, involving a chaotic showdown in an airplane cargo hold, is one of the only sequences that captures the breathless, mad-cap action of the video games (keep your physics logic at home, please).  But the climactic chase sequence is when Uncharted finally comes into its own, with an imaginative set-piece combining a helicopter chase with the swashbuckling fun of Pirates of the Caribbean. If only the filmmakers were able to start where they finished. Instead, they rely on Tom Holland‘s charisma as Nathan Drake to carry the day.  Luckily, Holland is one of our most charming actors working today, and he knows how to center a blockbuster, so he’s mostly able to carry this thing on his back. Nathan starts out as a young boy in an orphanage, saying goodbye to his big brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow). When Sully tries to recruit the grown-up (and expert thief) Nathan to help him find Magellan’s gold, he mentions he’s worked with Sam in the past. Nathan’s love of history and adventure comes from his big bro, so when he hears his name mentioned, he jumps at the opportunity. Nathan may be chasing gold, but he’s really chasing the brother that got away. It’s a deep emotional well that the game series taps into wonderfully (see Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception), but here it rings hollow. Holland does his best to keep himself (and the audience) emotionally invested, but the script hamstrings him with obvious foreshadowing and ham-fisted dialogue.  Still, Holland’s innate charm helps usher us through some of the worst of it, especially early in the film when he works as a bartender in New York City. He spouts history lessons as he serves patrons cocktails and steals their jewelry at the same time, a nifty little reminder that he can do the plucky-lead thing in his sleep, even when tha material doesn’t serve him well.  The other notable performance here is Tati Gabrielle as Braddock, the diabolical minion for the Big Bad of the film, Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas). The only thing more badass than her sharp white haircut is her sleeve tattoos. Gabrielle brings a cunning, playful intensity to the role, but the movie sells her short by having Sully warn Nathan how terrifying she is without showing her doing anything. When the plot thickens, Gabrielle’s performance gets more magnetic and surprising, but the script keeps her from her full Bond villain potential. Uncharted may not be the rollicking good time we want it to be, but people may forget that the first game wasn’t so hot either. With Holland at the center and infinitely fun ways to find treasure in beautiful locations, future sequels could get better as the games did. They could also jump ahead 20 years and cast Nathan Fillion to answer the prayers of the series’ ardent fans. But for now, we’re stuck with a dull attempt at a blockbuster franchise that’s as middle-of-the-road as the pizza that sponsors it. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them. Maybe you’ve just seen Oppenheimer and have the strongest urge to marathon—or more fun yet, rank!—all of Christopher Nolan’s films. Or maybe you’re one of the few who haven’t seen Interstellar yet. If you are, then you should change that immediately; the dystopian epic is one of Nolan’s best, and with that incredible twist in ...  Which Netflix Country has Interstellar? For whatever reason, The Hunger Games series isn’t available in the same countries around the world. You’ll find the first and second (aka the best) installments in Hong Kong, for instance, but not the third and fourth. It’s a frustrating dilemma, especially if you don’t even have a single entry in your region, which is ...  Which Netflix Country Has Each Movie of The Hunger Games?",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Uncharted game series protagonist Nathan Drake owns a ring he claims came from his forebear, explorer Sir Francis Drake. It’s engraved “Sic Parvis Magna,” or “Greatness from small beginnings.” The game series reflected that motto, with the modest first installment spawning three direct sequels, each better than the last.  But that greatness isn’t reflected in the movie version of Uncharted. It’s a small beginning for a possible Sony film franchise, but yet another dud of a video game adaptation. A glimmer of sequel potential is stowed away in a second post-credits scene, where a sudden burst of chemistry in the riffraff banter between treasure-hunting pals Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) is sure to make people wonder where such lively line deliveries have been for the last two hours. For one minute, everything about the characters feels right, but it comes far too late. Throughout the film, Zombieland and Venom helmer Ruben Fleischer and screenwriters Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway ping-pong between as many game franchise characters and new additions as they can possibly cram into one origin story. In the game series, the characterization is more compact and robust. The Drake-and-Sully duo function as the thieving core in the first installment, before the designers expand their roster and flesh out their backstory in subsequent entries. The series’ villains have never been interesting, but there’s some personality behind motives like seeking the Tree of Life to gain eternal youth, or magicians attempting to fracture Nathan and Sully’s deeply established friendship. That verve is missing in the film version as well. The film version feels like the writers were assigned different aspects of adapting the Uncharted formula: puzzle-solving, sneaking around, parkour, and larger-than-life action. The fragmented story makes it even more difficult for them to introduce and alternate between so many different characters. But even without the burden of introducing so many characters, the choices propelling Uncharted still lack stakes, genuine peril, fascinating twists on history, or adrenaline-pumping adventure. Some of the action sequences are lifted straight from the games, most recognizably the much-advertised cargo-plane fight from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, where Nathan free falls to what seems like certain death. Fleischer and the writers find convenient ways to initiate the set piece — which in the games builds from a car chase in which the player jumps into the plane as it’s taking off on the runway — but in live-action it’s done with a blockbuster kitchen-sink method that can’t escalate the tension with so many characters in the mix. It’s admirable that they want to shake up the familiar elements, but there’s no weight or emotional gravitas to anything that happens. (Also, anyone who’s played these games knows nothing should come easy or convenient for Nathan Drake.) The Uncharted games have never focused on realistic action, but some moments in the film adaptation still stretch the fantasy a bit too far. (There’s some business with a sports car that would make Dominic Toretto blush with embarrassment.) It’s as if no one bothered to consider how cartoonish chaos would come across in the context of a two-hour movie that veers between serious and lighthearted. There’s no room for any spectacle to stand out, or for the characters to develop a rapport organically. Various fight sequences are choppily and rapidly edited together, surrounded by obvious green screens. That’s a particular disappointment, considering the four mainline Uncharted games consistently pushed the boundaries of what the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 could achieve graphically. Worst of all, the central characters lack even a trace of dimension. In defense of Tom Holland, his basic movements — punching combos, climbing, and positioning behind objects when sneaking — are so carefully calibrated to his video game counterpart that when no one is speaking, and there is a moment of coherence in the action, it’s briefly thrilling to see Drake brought to life so efficiently on the silver screen. Even the way Nathan Drake and Sully disperse upon entering a Barcelona church to look for clues feels like it’s modeled after the games, with the audience in the action, searching alongside the characters. But from the moment Sully walks into a New York bar where Nathan is serving up drinks, being a know-it-all wise-ass, and pickpocketing patrons, the line readings feel forced in a manner that suggests neither of these performers has fully cracked how these characters bounce off each other. The script rarely gives them anything funny to say, which doesn’t help. Mark Wahlberg doesn’t even seem to be trying to replicate Sully, which makes it even stranger when he changes up his accent for one line to sound like him. The game’s version of the character is more of a sarcastic Bruce Campbell type than Marky Mark’s motormouth effusion. Even when Holland occasionally seems like a decent version of Nathan Drake, Wahlberg is usually in the same frame to obliterate the illusion.  Actors stepping into a video game adaptation don’t need to look or sound exactly like their digital counterparts. At the end of the day, all that matters is whether Uncharted the movie crackles as a quest for gold with likable characters. The problem is that it doesn’t. The version of Sully here is a much more selfish and greedy man who recruits Nathan to locate lost gold from a doomed Ferdinand Magellan expedition. Nathan is uninterested, until Sully mentions that he was trying to uncover the mystery with Nathan’s brother Sam, whom Nathan hasn’t seen since Sam ran away from the orphanage where they lived as children. Nathan has some stashed-away postcards Sam sent him over the years, suggesting that he does still care about Nathan. (Besides, it wouldn’t be an Uncharted story without crumpled handwritten visual clues.) According to Sully, the final clue is hidden in them, and following the clues could let the brothers reunite. With his hunger for the gold and Nathan’s for reconciliation intertwined, they join forces. Nathan comes into their first DIY field mission as a rookie who fumbles his plans and hasn’t gotten down the basics of jumping and swinging yet. That sequence — inspired by Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End — stands out slightly, given the sense that Nathan is actually in danger. But his flaws, and the life-or-death stakes, disappear in the blink of an eye. If the movie needs him to be good at something, he suddenly is.  Among the other game characters the film introduces, Sophia Ali manages the film’s best game-character mimicry as Sully’s partner in crime Chloe Frazer. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves implies Chloe and Nathan had a romantic past, but the movie doesn’t fill in any intriguing gaps, beyond how they met and how Nathan crushed on her. Instead, Uncharted uses all these characters and clues to set up a story about trust. Backstabbing takes center stage, but only as a mechanism to keep the plot going. None of these thieves can trust each other, which is par for the course in an Uncharted narrative, but there might be more double-crosses and betrayals here in two hours than there are in any one of the 12-to-15-hour games. Hot on Drake and Sully’s tail is Antonio Banderas’ Santiago Moncada, the son of a wealthy businessman and descendent of the original Magellan expedition. Santiago sees himself as heir to the spoils and will stop at nothing to retrieve the fortune, especially since his father has no intentions of passing the family’s riches down to him. In a move that might be more unbelievable than all the action sequences combined, Santiago’s father is thinking about giving that wealth to the people as a means of taking accountability for the family’s tainted lineage. So the race is on for Santiago to beat the heroes to the treasure, and he enlists mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, turning in a physically imposing performance) to get a leg up on Drake and Sully. The filmmakers have the right idea of what makes an Uncharted action set piece, whether they’re molding a sequence after something from the games, or inventing something entirely new that would fit within one of them, like a bit involving characters battling inside pirate ships hoisted into the air by airplanes. But the execution is flat, inconsequential, and boring. Not even a remix of the Uncharted theme during a climactic shootout, padded up to that point by generic action muzak, brings joy. One of the only laughs in the movie comes when Nathan Drake notices that even the bad guys are turning on one another. “Seems like it’s hard to keep a partner for long in this business,” he quips. It feels like something his game counterpart would say. Maybe someday, film adaptations of video games will stop betraying us by putting in minimal effort to acknowledge what fans enjoy about the source material, then failing to translate that vague understanding into onscreen excitement. Practically everyone here but Wahlberg is trying to ignite some sort of fire, but just as with the running gag about Nathan failing to properly use his trusty lighter, the spark keeps dying. Some things just aren’t destined for greatness.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," In the age of Google Maps and Google Earth, it’s refreshing, if perhaps also a bit naive, to imagine a world in which certain parts of it might still remain, as the title of a new movie has it, uncharted. Yet “Uncharted,” the action-adventure film inspired by the treasure-hunting video game franchise, is as old-fashioned as the notion of 16th-century Spanish galleons packed with billions of dollars’ worth of gold hiding someplace that just hasn’t been pinned on a map yet. The movie opens with, as it were, a bit of truth-in-advertising: a scene, without warning or preamble as to what is going on, that sets the level of preposterousness to which we are about to be treated. Tom Holland (playing who or what we do not know yet) is shown unconscious and clinging, by his shoe — stuck in the webbing of a large crate — to a chain of enormous parcels that are trailing from the open bay of a cargo plane in midair, like a string of giant pearls. Over the next minute or so, his character wakes up to perform a ballet of derring-do that is as physically improbable as it is fun to watch. That’s assuming that you are of a mind to swallow this load of malarkey. It’s as if the movie, directed with cartoonish glee and special dispensation from the law of gravity by Ruben Fleischer of the Zombieland films, is saying to us: “If you can’t buy this baloney, you might as well stop watching now. It’s only going to get worse.” Holland plays Nate Drake, said to be a descendant of the pirate Francis Drake, and the pickpocket-turned-partner of Mark Wahlberg’s Victor “Sully” Sullivan, both of whom are in pursuit of bounty that has been hidden by the crew of the explorer Ferdinand Magellan for hundreds of years. Their competition in the hunt comes from a trio of unscrupulous rivals, played by Antonio Banderas, Tati Gabrielle and Sophia Ali, the latter of whom is Nate and Sully’s sometime colleague. Alliances shift here, like the wind, including that between Nate and Sully (who complains about his bad ankle and failing eyesight, in an amusing nod to the almost 50-year-old Wahlberg’s advancing, er, maturity). What transpires is part heist flick, part “Mission: Impossible”-lite, with a dollop of Dan Brown (for the puzzles), the DNA of Nicolas Cage in “National Treasure” and mildly zingy buddy-banter dressed up with a bit of  “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre’s” existential darkness. It’s all filmed in Fleischer’s signature kinetic style, which culminates in a chase scene between two freight helicopters transporting big wooden boats over the Banda Sea. (True to form for this sort of thing, “Uncharted” globe-trots from New York to Teterboro to Barcelona to the Philippines, though it really takes place entirely in a world of make-believe.) We’ve all been cooped up so long, it feels a bit salubrious to imagine flight — not just the aviatic kind, but the flights of fancy that “Uncharted” takes us on. Far-fetched? Yes. Inconceivable, eye-rolling, absurd too. It also feels a bit unreasonable to expect anything more — or less — from “Uncharted.”",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," There is no question that Tom Holland is the YA heartthrob du jour. If his Spider-Man box office draw were not sufficient proof, the repeated shirtless shots of him in his new film Uncharted should convince you. But popularity does not always translate into effective cinema, and here, Holland’s undeniable charm and comedic timing aren’t enough to rescue this videogame adaptation from becoming lost in a sea of movie clichés that always seem to infect adventure films modeled after the Indiana Jones series. Uncharted opens with a gravity-defying sequence that involves the open sea, flying cargo, and a speeding plane. One thing becomes immediately obvious about the film, which hails from Venom director Ruben Fleischer — when it comes to visual effects, it is ‘go big or go home.’ The camera work by cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung aids the VFX well enough, creating both surreal as well as hyperreal sensations. The camera tricks are gravity-defying and even nauseating to some extent, particularly since the film features a lot of falling. Suffice to say that Uncharted is something of a visual wonder, one that will inspire both awe and fear in audiences, and remind even the most reticent ticket buyers that there still are reasons to go to the multiplex. The film’s grandiose ambitions do not end with CGI, of course. Physical stuntwork and kinetic acrobatics play a significant part here as well. In that opening sequence, Holland’s Nate Drake jumps, skips, punches, climbs, and runs. Later on, Fleischer visually explains Nate’s implausible physicality by showing a shirtless Holland strengthening his upper body and flexing his bulging muscles. After all, why ask audiences to suspend their disbelief when the point is to construct a real, believable action hero, no spider bites necessary. But, it soon becomes apparent that for all of its moviemaking magic, Uncharted really is just smoke and mirrors. Why did the film begin with that scene in the first place, as it turns out to be a spot in the narrative that arrives roughly two-thirds of the way through? The answer is never given. I guess Sony just wanted this movie to start with a bang. Instead, that exciting first sequence gives way to a 15-year-old flashback, wherein the younger Nate recalls exploratory adventures with his brother, Sam. Fast-forward to the present day, when Nate is a slick-talking, fast-moving NYC bartender, and Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a seasoned fortune hunter, shows up asking Nate to help him find Magellan’s lost gold, the same loot that Nate and his brother used to fantasize about. You see, Nate Drake is of the Sir Francis variety, and though he has done no adventuring for years beyond picking the pockets of enamored young ladies, he is somehow prepared and ready for this job. Written by Iron Man scribes Matt Holloway and Art Marcum, the ambitious screenplay spans multiple continents and eras, introducing Antonio Banderas as the film’s principal foil, Sebastian Moncada, who like our young hero, is also of a centuries-old lineage. Sophia Ali flutters in and out of the proceedings as Chloe Frazer, a mysterious adventuress who Sully repeatedly warns Nate not to trust, resulting in some predictable consequences. Tati Gabrielle is the film’s acting highlight, as she portrays dangerous vixen Jo Braddock, who is entrusted by Moncada to ruin Nate and Sully’s little treasure hunt. The clichés begin to pile up quickly from that point on. Sully repeatedly warns Nate not to trust anyone in the con artist world they inhabit and then repeatedly betrays him. Chloe does the same, and the three of them engage in a game of backstabbings and double-crossings that becomes so predictable and uninteresting that it takes the “fool me once, fool me twice” saying to a whole new level. Of course, beneath the persistently traitorous facades of these characters lie hearts of solid gold, shining as bright as the ingots they’re after. The most hackneyed part of this unoriginal exercise — the predictable conclusion to the adventure — can be seen miles away and without a map, which puts a damper on the movie-watching experience. Worst still, Uncharted travails well-known trails at almost every intermediate stop between origin and destination. To be fair, Holland and Wahlberg share a kind of father-son chemistry and their connection is most evident while exchanging some well-placed jokes that are made more effective by Holland’s believably innocent demeanor and Wahlberg’s sarcastic, deadpan growl. Unfortunately for them, the very creation of their relationship is cliched and, therefore, it ultimately lacks much substance. The same goes for the sweeping vistas and the different sets that the duo visits. The scope of the proceedings — from New York to Barcelona to the Philippines — feels very Da Vinci Code. Just picture that film starring a young James Bond or Indiana Jones Jr. Unfortunately, the search for a long-lost treasure sprinkled with some family drama and a few amusing chuckles simply does not cut it anymore on the big screen, especially in comparison to those iconic franchises. Fundamentally, it is a shame that Uncharted’s creators did not pay as much attention to the screenplay as they did to the breathtaking special effects. The latter, combined with the appealing Tom Holland’s star power, should’ve been enough to lure audiences back to theaters, but moviegoers are also smart enough to smell Uncharted‘s groan-inducing script a mile away. There are 25 James Bond films available to watch at home with your family for less than the price of a single movie ticket, so why bother with what’s essentially a YA remake that breaks no new ground? The very title of Uncharted would seem to invite audiences on a journey to a place heretofore unexplored, untraveled, and unknown. For this movie to turn its back on that promise is a fatal error that is simply too hard to overlook for this critic.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Like text that’s been translated into another language and then re-translated back by someone else, Uncharted bears a clunky resemblance to any number of classic action-adventure movies. Technically, the film is a loose adaptation of Naughty Dog’s popular PlayStation video game series featuring treasure hunter Nathan Drake and his quest to solve various historical mysteries. Because the games themselves are heavily influenced by Hollywood, however, turning them into an actual, non-interactive movie inevitably creates an off-brand approximation of familiar multiplex fare. It’s a personality-free jumble of Indiana Jones, James Bond, National Treasure, The Da Vinci Code, and the more obnoxious Pirates Of The Caribbean sequels, serving up less inspired variations on fights, stunts, and clues you’ve seen before… minus all the distinct fun of navigating them yourself. What’s more, Uncharted isn’t even especially good fan service. Rather than adapt any of the actual games, its three credited screenwriters chose to invent a new origin story—one that omits the franchise’s primary female character, Elena Fisher. Drake, originally a sardonic figure clearly modeled after vintage Harrison Ford, is embodied onscreen by Tom Holland, who sheds his adolescent Peter Parker dorkiness but doesn’t replace it with anything especially forceful or memorable.  Following a quick in medias res opening (missing only the record scratch plus freeze-frame plus “Yep, that’s me”) and teen prologue (setting up Drake’s beloved, otherwise unseen older brother), we first encounter young Nathan working as a New York City bartender, flirting with customers as a prelude to picking their pockets. Almost immediately, he’s recruited by a former associate of his brother, Victor Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg, looking and sounding very little like the games’ gruff, mustachioed Sully), who wants Drake’s help in recovering—stealing, really—a centuries-old ornate cross that Sully claims is one of two secret keys that may unlock Ferdinand Magellan’s lost cache of gold. Sure, says Drake, because, hey, why not?  That degree of functional cutscene efficiency predominates throughout. Rarely do we get more from a non-action scene than the absolute minimum required to move the plot forward. Non-expository dialogue frequently has the general shape of badinage but lacks any actual wit, or even humor. (“Everything out of this one’s mouth is an exaggeration, a half-truth or an outright lie,” someone tells Drake of Sully. The latter’s deathless rejoinder: “You know what? That is not true!”) Occasionally, something legitimately funny sneaks in—there’s a terrific payoff to Drake’s reason for including a cat in the list of items he needs Sully to procure for him at one point—but Uncharted’s default mode is disappointingly generic. That’s especially true of its ostensible bad guy, rival treasure hunter Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), whose ruthlessness might as well be a cruise-control setting. Only marginally more interesting are Moncado’s primary muscle, Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, appropriately fierce in a traditionally male role), and game favorite Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), whose motives and loyalties remain typically ambiguous. Alas, everything skews gargantuan these days, and director Ruben Fleischer (who’s previously helmed the Zombieland films and the first Venom) also orchestrates some physics-defying green-screen outrageousness, riffing on vertiginous action scenes from the games. Clambering up a series of crates dangling from a plane’s cargo hold is a blast in Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception; watching Tom Holland do the same on the big screen, it’s hard not to look around for Tyrese Gibson and Ludacris. By the time Drake is engaged in pirate-style skirmishes on the deck of a sailing ship being airlifted by a helicopter, Uncharted has fashioned an exhaustively detailed map of the average viewer’s Blu-ray collection and/or Netflix queue. And if you’re somehow hungry for a sequel, never fear: Uncharted 2 (ft. Pilou Asbæk) actually kicks off during the closing credits. This is how we live now, apparently.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022","  Uncharted fans need to lower their expectations for the hit video games big-screen adaptation. A-list leads Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg elicit a few chuckles with their banter. But they never fully inhabit the beloved personalities of the swashbuckling fortune hunters. Uncharted has a rote and uninspired plot that struggled to hold my attention. The film comes across as an adventure by checklist. Ticking boxes for parkour, puzzles, and gunplay as a weak nod to the much better source material. It also doesn’t help that the clunky CGI action looks like PS4 cutscenes.   The story begins with a young Nathan Drake (Tiernan Jones) watching his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), run away from their orphanage after a botched heist. Years later, the adult Nathan (Tom Holland) works as a bartender at an upscale New York City restaurant. He gives the patrons history lessons while ripping them off. Nathan gets a visit from Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). He and Sam were partners searching for Ferdinand Magellan’s fabled lost gold.   Nathan joins Sully’s quest to find out what happened to his brother. They have formidable adversaries also seeking the treasure. Santiago Moncado (Antonio Banderas), whose family funded Magellan’s expedition in the 16th century, has hired a ruthless mercenary to recover his ancestral birthright. Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and her goons will stop at nothing to find the billions in gold. Nathan and Sully are forced to join forces with Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), another ex-partner, on a globetrotting race against Moncado.   Let’s start with full disclosure. I’ve played and thoroughly enjoyed every Uncharted video game since the classic “Drake’s Fortune”. My goal was to watch this film as a die-hard fan. And to also view it dispassionately for those who aren’t familiar with Naughty Dog’s Playstation franchise. Uncharted sadly fails on both counts. It’s a lackluster representation of the game and a tepid action-adventure flick. Cardboard supporting characters, a banal script, and cartoonish visual effects add up to disappointment. There’s an engagement level the film never attains. The fun factor is missing from the narrative.   Tom Holland is miscast as Nathan Drake. He has a charming disposition and definitely bulked up. But doesn't have the swagger and physical stature of the game's protagonist. The attributes that make Tom Holland a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man work against him as Nathan Drake. A decade ago we were all begging for Nathan Fillion. I couldn’t help but think about him while watching the film, Fillion as Drake and Russell Crowe as Sully. That ship has long sailed to fantasy land. Uncharted’s producers need to bend the character towards Holland’s strengths for the inevitable sequels.   I wish there was something outstanding in this film to warrant a recommendation. Uncharted goes through the motions but never finds its footing. Antonio Banderas was obviously collecting a paycheck here. Stick around during the credits. The game storylines are very entertaining on YouTube if anyone wants a better Uncharted experience. Uncharted is produced by Columbia Pictures, Playstation Productions, and Atlas Entertainment. It will have an exclusive theatrical release on February 18th from Sony Pictures.  Julian Roman has been with Movieweb for twenty years. An avid film buff, he watches nearly 200 films a year across every genre. He feels lucky to have interviewed and written extensively about Hollywood's greatest talents. In his spare time he plays guitar, treasures good company, and always seeks new adventures. The MMA fighter will make his acting debut in the reimagining for Prime Video, but Hollywood was courting him long before Doug Liman came along.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," When is a cannonball not just a cannonball? When it's a sight-gag aimed straight at Tom Holland's crotch, that's when. Rolling up out of nowhere in the explosive and overblown finale to Ruben Fleischer's fitfully entertaining but mostly lifeless video-game adaptation Uncharted -- which involves two full-sized pirate ships being swung below dueling helicopters careening through tropical passageways; don't ask --  the cannonball strikes me as more than just a cannonball and more than just a kick-in-the-nuts punchline. The cannonball becomes a Mousetrap-type puzzle-piece that Uncharted doesn't have the madcap skill to deploy in any interesting fashion. It's a what-could-have-been in the movie that never was. We would have seen them banging around the unsteady surface of these freewheeling topsy-turvy boats, perhaps hitting bad guys at the right moment. Perhaps there's a chase where the characters run on them Wile E. Coyote style? Picture that maze game we all played as children where you try to get the little ball into the center hole by tilting the surface around, made blockbuster larger-than-life epic. Imagine what a Steven Spielberg or Joe Dante would have done with the physical comedy of setting that cannonball up for a richer target? The pieces they would have planted early on in the sequence that become pay-offs down the line. But no, ten minutes into this ongoing spectacle Fleischer just has a cannonball pop out of nowhere and hit Tom Holland in the nuts. That's the low-hanging fruit (sorry) that Uncharted deals in, time and again -- if there's an obvious, this movie will find it.  If you're unfamiliar with the video games (I'm with you) they're Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider adjacent, with Nathan Drake as a globe-hopping adventurer looking for the typical glittering booty of yore. I did know beforehand that there was outcry when Holland was cast as Drake, who in the games is a middle-aged man scamp of the Nathan Fillion sort -- Tom Holland is not that, and Uncharted very much wants Tom Holland to very much not be that. Uncharted wants Peter Parker. Just one who can swear lightly and rob rich girls without a second thought. And so that's what we get. Don't go so far as to think that this is might be a Peter Parker who fucks, though -- at one point Mark Wahlberg's character (as the potentially dubious treasure-hunter who drags Tom on the treasure's trail) implies Tom's got the hots for a woman and it lands with all the thud of a cannonball -- this dude's crotch is for violence and mild chicanery only, thank you. The story, a stitched-together patchwork of old frayed maps, cobwebbed passageways, and sinister Euro-sleaze types (Antonio Banderas, collecting a paycheck), has Nathan living life as a pickpocketing bartender, abandoned years earlier by his brother Sam. Soon enough Drake gets sucked into the bigger-time by Wahlberg's Sully, who has been trying to find Magellan's fabled gold stash along with Sam before something mysterious happened, leading to Sam's disappearance. Sully thinks Nathan might have a clue via cryptic communications from his brother on about where to go next, and before you know it they're smashing through the churches and Papa Johns of Barcelona together, forging a sibling-like relationship of their own all while a gang of scary mercenary-types (led by Tati Gabrielle, far too good for what she's given) conduct most of their violence just off-frame, lest this thing get too scary for the target audience. There are some good gags scattered about Uncharted -- I quite liked how the hunt that takes them through the usual crypts and tombs buried beneath ancient Barcelona is broken up by a literally-underground dance club and the aforementioned Papa Johns -- but like that product placement this is first and foremost a sanded-down franchise-building machine at work, and feels it from start to finish. The baddies are so nondescript that the standout is best known for being Scottish, and the globetrotting (a big part of what makes this genre so much fun) is rushed and half-glanced, so we could be in any ""beach"" or any ""city"" at all times. A quick shot of Gaudi's Sagrada Família at one point feels like it's kind of own desecration; this generic movie does not earn that true spectacle.  Uncharted isn't as bad as Netflix's Red Notice earlier this year and that was, by their accounts, a hit, so perhaps this one too will sit well with audiences who are understandably just looking for a distraction -- I get it. Holland is serviceable, khaki-bland, appealing to all the quadrants. Wahlberg is terrible but what's new there; somebody apparently likes what he's bringing. If only some ingenuity and personality had managed to weasel their way through the committees that plainly compacted this Franken-movie into its final perfect cubed form, what could have been? Right? If you deviate off the map that's when your trip gets interesting. And sometimes a proper kick in the nuts is just what's called for.  This looks so bloated.  I love Tom Holland but I have no interest in seeing this film at all.  It just looks so generic and totally beneath Holland.",NEGATIVE

"Feb 15, 2022"," As soon as they put bubble gum in Tom Holland’s mouth as Nathan Drake in Uncharted, he looks and comes off like a kid. Any character shadings that were attempted to make the young man look and act more 25 than 15 go right out the escape hatch window with every clumsy chomp. The gum is just the first of many (likely picky) things that set Tom up for maturation failure.  There’s desirable women calling him “sweet” and “cute” like he’s an elementary schooler instead of seeing him as a studly hero. There’s the more capable Mark Wahlberg calling him “kid” every chance he gets. Even the shortened nickname of “Nate” sounds like the nice boy from Algebra class writing you notes at your locker and not the “puckish rogue” out there challenging history’s great mysteries with determination, grit, and courage. None of those interactions and traits do Tom Holland any favors in a big spot that he should have been allowed to outright own. By golly, it’s a good thing the kid (see, there I go doing it too) is an upper-level movie star athlete pulling off his own moves and an even better thing the high adventure that requires him to run, jump, leap, flip, and swing without his trusty Marvel webs is very entertaining. Still, what should be the second coming of Indiana Jones comes off more like a graduation and gender swap of Dora the Explorer. Loosely borrowing plot points from the hit gaming universe created by Amy Henning (particularly the fourth console chapter), Uncharted plays like an origin story to thrust the Sir Francis Drake descendant into the world of treasure hunting. Nate’s older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow of Outer Banks) introduced him to the mythic spectacle of exploration history as an orphaned pre-teen before disappearing on the run. The grand lost ships and absconded gold of Ferdinand Magellan was the legend Sam most chased with nothing but postcard breadcrumbs of his world-hopping whereabouts. Fast-forward to the present and the now 25-year-old Nathan gets by as a Brian Flanagan-wannabe bartender and pickpocket before being recruited by Sam’s old partner Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) to join where his brother left off in the search for Magellan’s riches. That puts the two Bostonians in a precarious race of potential betrayals against the merciless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas, chewing the scenery of his Barcelona stomping grounds), the Spanish billionaire who claims a generational birthright to the missing gold, his fetching hired muscle Jo Braddock (The 100’s Tati Gabrielle), and the side-choosing tweener Chloe Frazier (Sophia Ali, formerly of Grey’s Anatomy). Uncharted spins its globe from there. With big studio backing and excellent stunt work coordinated by Stephen Dunleavy (The Matrix Resurrections), the sizable set pieces and physical brawn of Uncharted are top-notch. Cinematographer Chung Chung-hoon (Last Night in Soho) and editors Chris Lebenzon (Top Gun: Maverick) and Richard Pearson (Wonder Woman 1984) created a polished production of visible stability that glides with the moving muscles on-screen and avoids the herky-jerky shaky cam of other action flicks. Holland’s extraordinary athleticism is on full display and that key trait couldn’t be more fitting for this role. Everyone else is out there trying to keep up with him, including the subpar score support from composer Ramin Djawadi.. That said, the way Tom and the movie are brought down is with the underlying ageism in the script and ensuing actions. A little thing here or a little thing there would have been passable because the boyish charm is a very evident strength of Brit. However, thanks to his work playing a teen Spider-Man, Holland has not been able to fully demonstrate adult charm in his career to date. He couldn’t pull off getting aged in Cherry, and he’s not going to be, from the chest up anyway, a cultured and cultivated Fred Astaire whenever that rumored biopic gets to shooting if he’s constantly pigeon-holed. LESSON #2: LOSE THE KID JOKES– Here in Uncharted, it started with the aforementioned bubble gum and “kid” labels. The puberty jokes for facial hair, dead-end flirting failures, and even nonsense like the inability to tie a necktie at the age of 25 when you’re a high-end bartender to the point where you need Mark Wahlberg’s father-figure help all pile on in a recurring fashion. Even if he knowingly does not match the classic character description anymore than Tom Cruise matched that of Jack Reacher, all those belittlements peck away Tom Holland’s legitimate efforts to rise into this iconic part with the proper physicality and maturity. How are we expected to take him seriously when the movie doesn’t try to do so in the first place? Many may be left looking back at the long developmental hell of Uncharted and wishing for what could have been. Mark Wahlberg was attached to Nathan Drake and his dirty henley shirt for over a decade. At 50 with impeccable hair and plenty of buffness left in his broad shoulders, Wahlberg comes off as too young to play the gray-haired Sully part. Mark probably should have kept the leading role, which suits the usual Hollywood ball hog who’s made a living essentially playing himself and stealing spotlights. But then we wouldn’t have Tom Holland. We would be left with just another Wahlberg-playing-Wahlberg movie.  In many ways, Tom Holland’s efforts in Uncharted are sabotaged. If Zombieland and Venom director Ruben Fleischer and his trio of screenwriters with varying TV and Transformers series experience shaved out all those dumb pot shots and gags, both Holland and the entire movie would be tougher and tighter without losing an ounce of charismatic appeal. The lush international escapades of it all are that good and crowd-pleasing for the big screen. Yet, they can’t seem to help themselves with the low-hanging fruit, and here we are stuck with diminishing returns that are too telegraphed and too easy. Tom is the gift that is wasted. LESSON #3: IF IT’S LOST, IT CAN BE FOUND– Uncharted ends with accomplished heroes and teasers promising big developments and future capers. Like the movie says over and over with this lesson’s mantra, there is time and growth possible to save and improve this eager PlayStation Studios franchise starter. With the origin story out of the way, maybe they can unshackle their marquee star and get into some real danger. To do that, they need to start with spitting out all the bubble gum.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," Uncharted is one of those video game franchises that wows you to no end. As adventurer Nathan Drake, the player traverses the globe exploring all different environments, most of which become the settings for some of the most epic, jaw-dropping action set pieces imaginable. And you’re in the middle of the action, as the player, hanging on for dear life. In the film version, directed by Ruben Fleischer and hitting theaters on Friday, that general idea is present. Nathan Drake, played by Tom Holland, is still an explorer traveling the world. He’s getting into impossible situations and the film aims to give its audience unforgettable action set pieces with an emotional connection needed to give them drama and stakes. However, during its roughly two hour runtime, it never quite finds the balance a game can in five or six times that. And what happens when there’s no balance? You fall flat. The problems begin almost right from the start as Uncharted cold opens in the middle of one of its two epic action sequences. Nathan Drake wakes up in midair, stuck in a cargo netting falling from the sky. He fights his way back up and before you know it, it’s 15 years earlier. Drake, now 10 years old (and played by Tiernan Jones) and his older brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) are getting into trouble at a Boston boarding school and Sam decides to split, leaving Nathan behind. The story then jumps back to the present where Nathan, living in New York City and making his way as a bartender and pickpocket, is asked by James “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a man who was friends with Sam in the 15 years he’s been gone, to help him finish what he and Sam started. Truly, there’s almost no better microcosm for Uncharted’s fatal flaws. A big action scene goes right into a scene meant to deepen the characters, which is a little too rushed, and then the plot of the movie runs in, a little too conveniently. It’s a pattern that continues throughout, but is at least bolstered by a frequently funny back and forth repartee between Nathan and Sully. Their goal is to find $5 billion worth of gold the explorer Magellan hid centuries ago, which will require them to have two special keys, a map, solve a bunch of riddles, etc. Also on the case is rich guy Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) who believes he has a birthright to the treasure and has hired a vicious mercenary named Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) to help him get it. And so Nathan and Sully, with the help of the mysterious Chloe (Sophia Ali), go after the treasure while battling Moncada and Braddock. Which, on the surface, sounds great—if only it gave us those big Uncharted action scenes held together with some meaningful emotion. Instead we get two set pieces total, the one that we see for no reason at the beginning on the plane and at the very end with giant, flying pirate ships. (Both of which I’m OK spoiling because each feature prominently in the trailers, as does the movie’s mid-credits scene—in case you were wondering just how little Uncharted cares about big surprises.) In between there are other action sequences, but most are very familiar: shooting, punching, solving clues like something out of The Goonies, pretty standard.  As for that emotion, huge chunks of what might have made the characters more interesting are mentioned then thrown away, almost like writers Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway knew these things were crucial but weren’t able to give them enough time to develop. We learn early on that Nathan and Sam lost their parents, but how and why never comes back. We know both brothers are interested in history and exploration, but after Sam leaves it isn’t explained what or why Nathan is doing living in New York as a bartender. Once Sully and Chloe are introduced, the main thing they all bond over is not trusting each other, which leads to some clever double crosses, but a real lack of faith in them as humans. So basically we’re just watching people we don’t really know, but have heard a little bit about, running around being bad to each other. Which sounds awful. And while it’s not good, it’s surprisingly watchable thanks to the performances of the actors. Tom Holland is just plain charismatic as Nathan Drake. Even though the character as written doesn’t have much depth, Holland’s charming, lovable demeanor makes it not just work, it makes it fun. Add to that his banter with Wahlberg’s Sully, and even when the movie isn’t going anywhere, it’s enjoyable to see them going back and forth time and time again.  The other standout is Tati Gabrielle as Moncada’s gun for hire, Braddock. Best known for playing Gaia on The 100, she’s terrifying in a way that you’d almost like to see her win because she’s that damned cool. It’s probably because the film doesn’t care about her backstory, only making her look wildly awesome, that she comes off that way. She’s a star in the making. And, I have to admit, those two big Uncharted set pieces are damned near worth the prices of admission on their own. They could have been more rousing if the movie was more concerned with its characters—but even so, they’re about as close to the excitement of playing Uncharted as you can imagine seeing on screen. However, in comparison to the rest of the film, they feel so out of place that it almost makes you wish they weren’t in there. Almost.  If you sit down to watch Uncharted, you won’t hate yourself for doing so. The plane and pirate ship scenes are exhilarating to watch, Holland is super charming, his banter with Wahlberg is humorous, and Gabrielle’s Braddock is a showstopper. But all of that feels less carefully constructed and more thrown together with the hope that a name brand will tie it all together. It does not, a fact that becomes abundantly clear during the film’s credits. Then, and only then, is when the very recognizable, very awesome musical theme to the Uncharted games by Greg Edmonson is played. There it sits. Catchy, emotional, and a total afterthought, like so much of the movie before it.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022","  When Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune was released in 2007 on the PlayStation 3, one of the main compliments the Naughty Dog-developed game received was that it was like playing a movie. As the franchise has grown and technology has improved, this has only become more true, as the adventures of treasure hunters Nathan Drake and Victor Sullivan felt like the closest thing gamers could get to recreating their Indiana Jones dreams. Yet what made Uncharted such a compelling and engrossing series wasn’t its story—which, while solid, was still a mishmash of adventure stories seen plenty of times before—but that the player could experience these events first-hand, escape death at every corner, fight enemies around the world, and search for long-hidden treasure. What made Uncharted so great was that it put the player in Nathan Drake’s shoes.   Since Uncharted the game series borrowed so heavily from previous adventure stories, this franchise made the most sense as the first movie by PlayStation Productions. But in the over decade-and-a-half in development, filmmakers like David O. Russell, Free Guy’s Shawn Levy, and 10 Cloverfield Lane’s Dan Trachtenberg have all joined and left the project, while Venom director Ruben Fleischer has finally brought this story to the screen with Uncharted. But with Uncharted out, it’s easy to see what might have been the major obstacle in adapting such a cinematic game to film. When a game like Uncharted is so heavily influenced by adventure film formulas we’ve seen before, turning that game into a movie can start to like a copy of a copy of a copy.   Tom Holland stars as Nathan Drake, a young thief who is recruited by treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) for an adventure that will send them looking for 5 billion dollars worth of gold that has been missing for centuries. Along the way, Nathan and Sully will face double-crosses—both literal and figurative—adventure, and mysteries that have laid dormant since the age of Magellan. Victor and Sully are also joined by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), another treasure hunter who doesn’t trust this pair, as they try to find this mysterious prize before Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his associate Jo Braddock (TatiGabrielle).   Holland makes a decent Nathan Drake, playing the overwhelmed nature of the character in the most intense sequences quite well. Wahlberg and Banderas are both fine, but they do seem like odd choices in these roles, while Gabrielle is a standout, an intense villain who gives Uncharted its only real sense of true danger.   Fleischer starts this adventure with a cargo plane action scene ripped directly from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, then continues with a flashback of the younger Nathan and his brother Sam (Rudy Pankow), also almost shot-for-shot the same as the game. For many of these sequences that Fleischer tries to recreate, the overabundance of CGI not only takes away the stakes that were inherent in these games, but makes the viewer feel like they’re simply watching a video game being played.   Strangely, it’s the more gamey aspects of Uncharted that work well here, such as when Nathan, Sully, and Chloe try to solve several puzzles throughout Barcelona. Again, this segment is like watching a video game being played, but the focus on various clues, traps, and mysteries makes it one of the more intriguing parts of the film. The same could be said of Uncharted’s final action set piece, which is in the spirit of Uncharted, but at least tries something new, even if the lack of stakes and excitement are absent thanks to the over-reliance on special effects.   But still, Uncharted tries to recreate what worked in the game and can’t just copy-and-paste these elements in the way Fleischer attempts. The humor is extremely bland, the dynamic between Nathan and Sully never quite reaches the father-and-son relationship it wants to have, and the action can’t reconstruct the exhilaration and dread that these scenes once held. Narratively, some of these ideas can transcend format, but taking them and simply putting them as they once were in a decades-old video game doesn’t do Uncharted any favors.   Uncharted also struggles to not be extremely predictable along every step. The Uncharted games owe a large debt to Raiders of the Lost Ark, while the film tries to follow in the footsteps of Pirates of the Caribbean. Even though the film shouts out Indiana Jones and Jack Sparrow doesn’t negate the complete appropriation of what made those films work for this story. It’s also hard to stay completely invested in a mystery when the audience is usually several steps ahead of the supposed treasure-hunting experts.   Like another recent video game adaptation, Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City, Uncharted attempts to recreate iconic moments from a beloved game, while also trying to inject some decent new ideas into the story. The result is a mixed bag, as it shows fans things they’ve already seen, such brought to live-action, while for newcomers, these scenes are watered-down versions that don’t have the spirit that once made them great. In trying to please everyone, this type of borrowing from the games pleases no one.   But especially compared to other video game adaptations, Uncharted is better than most, which, still, isn’t exactly saying much. As the video game series grew, Uncharted became a fascinating world of interesting characters and exciting adventures full of opportunities and possibilities. Over the years, Naughty Dog shifted this series from a Raiders takeoff into its own gripping world, and while the Uncharted film is still too heavily reliant not only on what has worked in other action films, but more importantly, in these games themselves, there is the possibility this could be the start of a wonderful action franchise. There are elements that could be fleshed out in the future, but as a movie series, Uncharted isn’t quite there yet.

"Feb 15, 2022"," How is a movie based on a video game more soulless than the game itself? The knock against the world of gaming has long been that they lack a human element, but Ruben Fleischer’s “Uncharted” feels emptier than the award-winning franchise on which it’s based. Dominated by green screen special effects and thin treasure-hunt plotting, “Uncharted” fundamentally lacks the sense of adventure that turned the Sony games into some of the most beloved of all time. What’s most startling is how much the games themselves feel more cinematic in terms of world building, character, and narrative than the actual movie. It’s not quite as disastrous as some video game adaptations, and it’s at least light enough on its feet to never insult the intelligence of its fan base as so many of these movies tend to do. However, “Uncharted” seems to want to ride the goodwill of the video game adventures of Nathan Drake more than create any of its own; it takes no risks and feels like a bare minimum effort in terms of storytelling. Roger famously said that video games can never be art. The ones on which this movie is based are certainly more artistic. If anything saves “Uncharted” from the depths of the worst video game adaptations, it’s the relative charm of the cast. Holland may be miscast, but he’s just an incredibly likable movie star, and I hope he can find parts that better utilize his charms. Wahlberg creates a nice balance between his charisma and the exhausted tone of a treasure hunter who has seen and done enough, and just wants that final gig that can set him up for life. Banderas is wasted and Gabrielle is inconsistent, but Ali is arguably the one performer who gets that “Uncharted” should be fun. She gives the film some much-needed energy and unpredictability when she's on-screen.

"Feb 15, 2022"," Ruben Fleischer's Uncharted is the kind of video game movie that playfully enjoys being a video game movie and revels in how silly video game plots can get. 

Tom Holland's Nathan Drake finds himself on an incredible journey that spans the globe and defies rationale — far beyond what Indiana Jones might comprehend. It's more in line with National Treasure, but even louder and with even more extravagant action, which is a good thing with such a by-the-book screenplay that submits itself to the kind of spectacular events made for controllable game playthroughs. Fans of Naughty Dog's cinematic series about Nathan Drake's exploits will find a younger Nathan portrayed by Holland. Mark Wahlberg co-stars as Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan, who encounters Nathan for the first time — well before their longstanding and much-storied partnership. 

Sully's chasing Ferdinand Magellan's lost fortune — from the House Of Moncada — but so is the House's prodigal son, Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas). It's Sully and Nathan vs Santiago and his assassin sidekick Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), but there's more at stake than just riches for Nathan. Sully's the last person who's seen Nathan's brother Sam alive — searching for the same treasure. If Nathan locates that missing gold, maybe he'll reunite with Sam after many lonely years. It's a film almost a decade in the making — dating Sony's first intentions to bring Nathan Drake to the silver screen — which initially had Mark Wahlberg in the Nathan Drake role. You can't ignore the specter of doubt surrounding movies like Uncharted that get stuck in development hell, but Fleischer handles the challenge well. Newcomers to Nathan Drake's legacy and die-hards, who've maxed out their Uncharted Playstation achievements, are on equal ground given how this prequel starts fresh. Nathan is a cocktail-swinging New Yorker who Sully selects to go on the adventure of a lifetime — there's not much else to know about the backstory outside Nathan's brotherly woes, sticky fingers and the constant reminder that Nathan should trust no treasure hunter. Tom Holland's performance as Nathan Drake overcomes the two biggest fears headlining internet conversations. Could he prove why the fan-favorite, Nathan Fillion, wasn't selected as the picture-perfect Nathan Drake? Would Holland be able to shed the ""young Marvel hero"" persona that's currently his brand? Both questions are answered by a certainly no gruffer and yet believably action hero-y Holland, whose chemistry with Wahlberg is double aces. The two swindlers and thieves maintain an antsy repertoire that proves why you can't trust swindlers and thieves but slowly builds their relationship into more than just throwaway accomplices. Nathan's pure heart and Sully's cynical business approach lead a winning expedition into action-comedy beats that don't skimp on either (it's humorous only when appropriate). As accomplices and villains get involved, Holland and Wahlberg only shine brighter. Sophia Ali's presence as rival-slash-helper Chloe Frazer is the foil to Nathan's innocence as her guile gets her what she wants and keeps both men on their toes. Assassin, Tati Gabrielle, is a stone-hardened badass who rightfully amplifies tension whenever her knockout killer character, Braddock, steps into the frame. Antonio Banderas is there for namesake appeal and to sip fancy liquors while Braddock does the heavy fight choreography lifting — which Gabrielle executes with ease. More Tati Gabrielle in ass-kicker roles, please! As for the adventurer perils and mega-sized action set pieces of Uncharted, expect plenty of ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"". Everything from ancient temple chambers with signature traps, like water floods and shot arrows, to aerial ship battles as helicopters transport centuries-old wooden vessels with working cannons. Fleischer ensures that countless sequences feel at home within video game structures by throwing logic to the wind in favor of excitement — especially when recreating the ludicrous survival mission that is Uncharted 3's cargo plane crash. It's ""big"" and ""loud"" in all the right ways, reinforced by Nathan and Sully's wisecracks as they defy death— whether free-falling miles above ground or parkouring across Spanish rooftops. There's an Indiana Jones glimmer to it all through winks and nods, but Uncharted easily keeps stride with the classics. Against all odds, Ruben Fleischer breaks the Uncharted curse and has created something franchisable that puts (and keeps) butts in seats. Tom Holland has laid the groundwork for a Nathan Drake he can mature into, the same for Mark Wahlberg's curiously cat-friendly version of Sully. The swashbuckling, conquer-the-world, no-fear nature of Uncharted is alive and well in this enjoyable blockbuster treat. One that wears its intentions proudly like the gaudiest golden jewelry, somehow sporting the charisma and bravado to pull off the whole nutty ensemble.

"Feb 15, 2022"," When it comes to video games turned movies, they have a pretty bad track record. There have been very few who have made anyone really happy but Uncharted manages to bring us into the fold of Nathan Drake’s story in a new and exciting turn while still having that video game feel in the best possible way.  It’s not perfect and there are moments where the movie lags but not even Mark Wahlberg could stop me from having fun while watching Tom Holland come into his own in this take on Nathan Drake’s origin story.  Tom Holland plays Nathan Drake, an explorer who pairs his love of history and adventure with a thirst for the unknown thanks to his brother Sam. While Nathan was left at the orphanage after his brother was kicked out, he kept all the postcard correspondence that Sam had sent him throughout the last 15 years while still wearing his brother’s ring around his neck. All of this to establish that Nathan Drake cares about one person and it is his brother. All of this is just to set up why Nathan even takes an interest in what Sully (played by Mark Wahlberg) has to offer. Drake is a bartender who lives off of stealing small things like a bracelet off some woman who came to the bar. Sully comes to see him, slips him his card (and steals the bracelet off of Nathan) and waits for Nathan to come and find him. Their relationship starts with Sully using Nathan for his knowledge and what he thinks he knows thanks to his brother but he’s leaving information out so that Nathan will keep playing along with him. This constant struggle of not trusting anyone goes throughout the movie and there are times when it gets annoying because it is every character who doesn’t trust someone else but it does lead to a pretty shocking twist in the third act with Tati Gabrielle’s Braddock. While Uncharted is a high stakes action movie, it also has moments where you care about these characters. Nathan Drake is someone who grew up without his parents and only had his brother to look up to. Well, and the nuns of the orphanage where he lived. Something that the movie references multiple times, especially when Nathan has to go into a church with Sully and Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) and is afraid of a nun. Showing us that Nathan’s trauma from his childhood is still there under the surface even if he’s not the type to voice it. But what the movie really sets up is Nathan’s understanding of how the game works and how his relationship with Sully grows because of it. Every person who meets him when he’s with Sully tells him not to trust him but even when they’re on their first mission together, we can see Sully protecting Nathan.  Nathan doesn’t know where his brother is or if he’s alive still but we know throughout the movie that Sully both wanted Nathan to think he had seen him recently for his own benefit but also to protect Nate.  We know from the trailer that the cargo scene from the game happened and it’s a bit different this time around. Sully and Nathan are hiding in a car but when Nathan confronts Braddock and ends up having to fall out of a plane without a parachute (because, you know, a CAR hits him). The thing is: This movie is absolutely outrageous but in a way that works. You’re rooting for Nathan even though you know he’s probably going to figure it out and you end up cheering when he puts on the gun holster for the first time. It’s the kind of movie you’d want out of the Uncharted world and it is fun to see Tom Holland shine doing fun stunts and bringing an iconic character like Nathan Drake to life. Tati Gabrielle, Sophia Ali, Antonio Banderas, Mark Wahlberg, and Tom Holland bring the world of Uncharted to us in a new and exciting way and if this is the next big franchise for Holland, I wouldn’t be mad about it. Even if he did go full Peter Parker and apologize to a man plummeting to his death during that cargo scene.",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Sony’s feature film “Uncharted” may have its origins in a PlayStation game, but the real inspiration comes from a more analog source: jet-setting adventure flicks of decades past. The film’s script, the product of six credited writers, feels like a “frankensteined” effort of unrealized sequels to series such as “Indiana Jones” or “National Treasure.” Like the figures portrayed on screen, there’s a grail just evading their grasp. But unlike the characters, the film itself never recaptures that elusive glory. “Uncharted” gets quite the assist from casting two actors with well-known personas that can help fill in the gaps of their thinly-sketched characters. Tom Holland takes the lead as Henley-clad hero Nathan “Nate” Drake, an orphaned bartender (and erstwhile petty thief) summoned to an adventurous quest by the mere prospect of reuniting with his disappeared brother. This nebulous fraternal trauma is but the faintest of motivations propelling Nate forward, but in the hands of a skillful star like Holland, that matters little. He’s got the guilelessness of the “boy next door” archetype down to a science, leveraging the hopeful innocence of his appearance and attitude to gain immediate sympathy. Holland’s pairing with Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, a treasure hunter interested in fortune over friendship, makes sense on paper. The charm of his Spider-Man derived primarily from foiling him against Robert Downey, Jr.’s jaded Iron Man. Holland’s innate sweetness hit all the harder when seen directly opposite the alternative of cynicism. But “Uncharted,” asks him to go toe-to-toe with Wahlberg in smarm as the two men bicker across the globe in pursuit of treasure in Ferdinand Magellan’s lost ship. Throwing barbs feels anathema to Holland’s earnestness, and he never quite feels comfortable delivering the film’s over-workshopped zingers. (Luckily, Holland gets more to do than simply riding sidecar to the burly Bostonian.) Simply placing Holland and Wahlberg in the same film presents an interesting generational narrative. Both hail from disciplines that some regard as less masculine – Holland from theater and dance, Wahlberg from modeling — and have sought to establish their machismo in rugged action films such as these. Yet “Uncharted” chooses to extinguish any sparks that could be generated from the friction of their meta-narratives, always opting for the safest and blandest route toward its inevitable conclusion. Every line feels as if it had to pass a corporate committee vote, leaving the actors little to deliver beyond exposition and the occasional off-handed wisecrack. What “Uncharted” does not seem to understand about the best adventure films is that action set-pieces alone do not make for an exhilarating journey. It’s as much about the little interstitial bits that come in between, those revealing moments when the audience can realize the ordinariness of characters pulling off the extraordinary. When sanitized down to the barest minimum of component parts, there’s something lost — even if said parts are supersized and infused with adrenaline. And without well-defined characters, the emptiness of a quest for a MacGuffin becomes all the more pronounced.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Video game film adaptations have had quite a rollercoaster ride over the past 20 years. While there has yet to be one adaptation I’d consider outstanding or an all-timer, there have been an exciting array of films worth noting. Starting with the “so bad it’s good” Super Mario Bros., a movie that made all gamers and cinephiles aware that Mario and Luigi’s last names were indeed Mario. Then there’s Mortal Kombat: Annihilation, a film that cemented its place as one of the worst films I’ve ever seen from the first time I saw it. Despite that rough patch, the last few years have seen the quality of these films improve, and with one of my favorite video game franchises, Uncharted, on the horizon, I was optimistic a grand entry was near. While mostly entertaining, Uncharted is more “the greatest hits” than a faithful adaptation of the beloved franchise. Uncharted tells the story of Nathan Drake and opens familiarly with the third entry in the video game franchise. We enter Nathan’s world as Nathan and his brother Sam are off on an adventure that ultimately leads to Sam disappearing from Nathan’s life. Fast forward 15 years, Nathan is a bartender getting by until he meets Victor “Sully” Sullivan. In their encounter, Sully lets Nathan know about his connection to his brother, which leads to a quest to find Ferdinand Magellan’s lost treasure. To some, the film’s beats may feel familiar to Indiana Jones and National Treasure. However, Uncharted can stand on its own two feet with an origin story that allows its viewers to invest in the growth and development of Nathan Drake. While the third entry in the game franchise has sprinkles of prequel sprinkled through, Ruben Fleischer’s film dives deep into the origins of Drake, which allows those unfamiliar with the franchise to invest in Nathan and his ambition fully. While the CGI is borderline cringe-worthy at times, the action set pieces are delightful. From the parkour chandelier sequence to the Cocktail bartending scenes that would put a smile on Tom Cruise’s face, the film carries a punch of entertainment for all. While those set pieces are entertaining, it’s the nod to the opening of one of the games with Nathan hanging on for dear life on falling cargo, and it’s the finale with two ships that stand out. This is where the mix of practical effects and CGI works best as it leads to the thrill ride of a finale that is sure to please the majority of cinephiles. While Tom Holland was a controversial choice to some, I found it ideal casting for the direction Fleischer and his team were going in. Holland delivered a charismatic and emotional performance as Nathan Drake. Rather than embodying Drake’s grit and veteran mindset in the games, this version of Drake is still learning who he is and his motivations, which allows Holland to grow 100% into the Drake we all know and love. When it came to the casting of Mark Wahlberg, I wasn’t a fan. Nothing about Wahlberg’s performance gives fans comfort that Sully will be a great mentor to Nathan. Sully is quite unlikeable and will have fans long for Nathan to go on his journey without the nuisance of Sully. While Antonio Banderas and Tati Gabrielle understood their assignments, it’s quite a shame that Banderas was not given more to do other than play a villain. Instead, an Academy Award nominee was left to be a mustache-twirling villain that ultimately left me longing for more. Sophia Ali’s Chloe Frazer lays the cookie crumbs for a compelling character that is likely to be examined more if a sequel is green lit. While Uncharted did not fully enter the stratosphere of greatness, the film allows cinephiles to escape and travel into the world of Nathan Drake and its beautiful locales. Uncharted doesn’t break new ground but is entertaining enough. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," LOS ANGELES, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- Video games like Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia evoked classic adventure movies, but when they themselves were turned into movies, the films were just derivative. Uncharted, in theaters Friday, is a movie worthy of those that inspired the Playstation games. The quest for gold captures a modern day Indiana Jones adventure, which is also what the Tomb Raider games and movies were going for. Drake, Chloe and Sully solve puzzles from ancient texts, and explore booby trapped chambers. Some ancient temples clash right up against modern franchise establishments in a fun juxtaposition of how some historic cities evolved. The big set pieces encompass more of a modern visual effects aesthetic, but still evoke a video game sense of physical puzzle solving and overcoming escalating challenges. For example, the Pirates of the Caribbean and Mission: Impossible movies have pushed the limits of practical stunts and visual effects. Uncharted raises the stakes by combining a helicopter chase and pirate ship battle. The film obviously had to rely on green screen and visual effects elements to make that sequence possible. However, it incorporates enough of a natural environment and feeling of gravity to maintain a sense of real danger and excitement. The characters attempt to evoke a cat and mouse caper with constant double crosses. In that regard, there's minimal tension since no one ever has a strong upper hand. So the audience is never worried that the heroes won't soon prevail again. Braddock and Chloe make memorable foils, though, both rising above the stereotypes of villainess and love interest respectively. Drake is an endearing hero who will be fun to follow on other adventures, but his relationship with Sully has less energy than classic movie buddies. Wahlberg mumbles a lot of exposition anyway so viewers may miss half their relationship. If Uncharted were not based on a video game, it would hold its own with modern adventure movies. Since it is based on a video game, Uncharted overcomes the stigma of Super Mario Bros. and Prince of Persia to set a high score among adaptations.

"Feb 15, 2022","  Uncharted is a largely lifeless blockbuster, playing out as a series of basic set-pieces that follows the genre formula to a fault. A charming lead performance by Tom Holland, however, elevates the material, hinting at the far more unabashedly goofy and endearing action movie it could have been.   Uncharted serves as something of a prequel to the video game series of the same name. It follows the exploits of Nathan Drake (Tom Holland), a young thief and bartender who finds himself dragged on a globe-trotting adventure alongside the treasure-hunting conman Vincent Sully (Mark Wahlberg). After discovering that Sully formerly worked alongside Nathan's long-missing brother Sam (Rudy Pankow) on his search for lost treasure, Nathan agrees to accompany Sully as they hunt for the lost gold from the Magellan expedition.   Along the way, they race against rivals for the gold, including fellow treasure hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), the wealthy Spanish antiquities collector Santiago (Antonio Banderas), and the ruthless mercenary Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Their adventure takes them from the high-society of New York City to the streets of Barcelona, eventually leading to a race to recover the treasure in the Philippines. Along the way, Drake finds a surprising rapport with the distrustful Chloe and a love/hate bickering relationship with Sully -- whose promises of revelations about Sam entice Nathan along for the ride.   The Uncharted video game series was largely defined by recreating the tone of classic adventure films like Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, which makes the film a love letter to an extended love letter. As a result, there's nothing particularly unique or interesting about Uncharted, which is directed with workmanlike efficiency by Ruben Fleischer (Venom). For the most part, Uncharted will feel familiar to those who have seen an adventure movie before.   The script by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum, and Matt Holloway follows the basic plot beats one would expect from this genre, with the prerequisite romantic tension, betrayals, and pratfalls. The dialogue is wooden, and character motivation shifts at any given time to adhere to obvious double-crosses and plot twists. The special effects are stilted, and the dramatic beats that do land are almost immediately ignored after the fact while characters quip at each other.   The basic nature of the film, if nothing else, proves that Tom Holland might really be one of Hollywood's biggest stars. Drake's scattered story arc provides various tonal highlights for Holland to knock out. He proves just as adept at action, comedy, and drama as he's been in better fare, and brings a genuinely joyful element to what would otherwise be a soulless endeavor. Wahlberg and Ali do their best when they share scenes with Holland and mine real laughs out of their chemistry. Coupled with a handful of genuinely goofy action-set pieces (including an unapologetically ridiculous final set-piece that becomes fun despite itself), Holland turns a series of snarky traits into something resembling an actual character. Holland almost saves the film with sheer charm.   Uncharted could be much better than it is. Holland is a surprisingly good fit for Nathan as a character. His actual rapport with Wahlberg is solid if largely underutilized, with the pair separated for large swaths of the film. If it mined more over-the-top material, like the final act's completely bonkers set-piece, then it might have stood out beyond the clear inspirations that drive the run-time. While there have been far worse films, there aren't many that are as forgettable as Uncharted -- which is disappointing, considering how close Holland and the rest of the cast come to elevating the minor action film into something more engaging.  The Red Book in which Bilbo, Frodo and Sam wrote their adventures was more significant to The Lord of the Rings than it initially seemed.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Uncharted is a simple, safe, but ultimately pretty effective introduction to treasure hunter Nathan Drake. Fans of the beloved PlayStation games might be surprised to see how much has changed to fit an Uncharted story in a single movie’s runtime – it squeezes in a new origin story while reenacting action sequences from multiple games – but it all makes for a decently fun sampling of what Nate and Sully have to offer on the big screen.  For an origin story, Uncharted ironically doesn’t waste any time explaining the backstories of any of the characters. We’re immediately thrown into the exploits of cocky young thief Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and veteran treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), who tries to recruit Nate for an upcoming heist. They’re both looking for the next big score and that's really all the backstory you need to know. This allows Uncharted to hit the ground running, in a good way; I appreciate that the script doesn’t spend much time on unnecessary exposition, assuming you’re either in for the adventure or not. It doesn’t take long for Nate and Sully to meet up with the mysterious Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a fun and energetic addition who keeps everyone in this world-spanning adventure on their toes. As a fan of the games, the biggest question I had was if Tom Holland could pull off Nathan Drake, playing a slightly younger version of the character we know. The answer, thankfully, is yes. He’s as charismatic as ever, sinking his teeth into playing an Indiana Jones-type. I was never once distracted by the fact that this is the same actor who played Spider-Man in one of the biggest movies ever just a couple months ago. Mark Wahlberg does a decent job playing a wise-cracking mentor to Holland, but some of the things that make Sully so recognizable in the game didn’t survive the transition to the film. Sully is iconic, at least in part, because of his thick mustache and dark, booming voice, none of which Wahlberg has. After all, there’s no reason they couldn’t have thrown a ‘stache on Wahlberg, which even young Sully has in the games. At times, it felt like Mark Wahlberg was just playing Mark Wahlberg in an action movie instead of, you know, Sully. That being said, Wahlberg and Holland have fun chemistry, including some very good emotional scenes, so it’s mostly pretty easy to look past him not being entirely loyal to the source material. The cat-and-mouse plot doesn’t take itself too seriously, which is exactly what I would expect from a movie based on the Uncharted games. Basically, if this were a two-hour video game cutscene (which, I guess, is technically a movie anyway), I never felt like I wanted to press the skip button. We don’t get many moments that lean into its video game origins, but the movie does a fine job bringing the world of Uncharted to life. It plays it safe, seeing Nate, Sully, and Chloe engaging in witty and sometimes tech-heavy banter that isn’t prevalent in the games (for example, Nate makes fun of Sully for having Tinder on his phone). The trio gets into their fair share of fights, chase scenes, and booby traps as they go about collecting clues, solving puzzles, and traveling the world. It’s all pretty straightforward, but there were plenty of fun reminders that I was watching an Uncharted movie. Plus, Uncharted sets itself apart from other generic heist movies by leaning in on its solid dialogue and the silly, immature ways Nate tends to act in deadly situations. Very early on, Nate bumps into fellow treasure hunter Moncada (Antonio Banderas), and the way they exchange quips is endearing in a cartoonish sort of way. These types of scenes will be fun for a casual audience, but for those familiar with the games, it’s a loving recreation of the defining traits we know and love the most about Nathan Drake.  Speaking of the villains, the ones here are mostly forgettable. Antonio Banderas is great, but he’s not on screen nearly enough; his hired gun (Tati Gabrielle) is meant to be an equal rival from Sully’s past, but so little time is spent with her that I had to look up her name (it's Braddock) after I finished watching because the few passing mentions weren’t memorable at all. The villains’ storylines are anti-climatic and one-dimensional, and any motives for seeking the big treasure beyond simple greed are unclear. In a way, though, it’s oddly fitting, because while the Uncharted games have featured many antagonists, the real evil has always been about what greed can do to people. That theme is present throughout the movie, and that’s good enough for me. Announced in 2009, the Uncharted movie had been in development for so long that Mark Wahlberg went from being originally cast as Nathan Drake to eventually playing father-figure Victor Sullivan. In that time, the movie would have six directors come and go, including Shawn Levy (who left to direct Free Guy) and Dan Trachtenberg of 10 Cloverfield Lane fame. Sony finally locked in Venom director Ruben Fleischer in early 2020 and actually began filming in March 2020, only to shut down immediately due to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. After a decade of different writers, directors, and creative and scheduling conflicts, it made me wonder if there was some sort of ancient curse on this movie. Luckily, Sony was finally able to solve the puzzle, lift the curse, and find the treasure (which was my movie ticket). My favorite scenes in Uncharted all lived in the final act, where we finally see Nate and Sully in their element of pirate caves, shootouts, and shouting one-liners while being attacked by henchmen. It’s not until the end that we truly see the movie lean into its video game counterpart, with Holland running, jumping, and narrowly escaping death in moments that could have easily been a quick-time event. The love for the games is especially present in two mid-credit scenes, and it made me wonder why this movie couldn’t have been more of a direct interpretation. While it gets away with doing a new origin story and remixing other storylines directly from the games, it left me wanting more in a frustrating way. Still, if it’s your first experience with Uncharted, it’s a solid adventure that benefits from Holland’s charm, no matter how straightforward the plot might be. Uncharted is a safe but serviceable sampling of a new globe-spanning adventure. As a young Nathan Drake, Tom Holland is fun to watch and has good chemistry with Mark Wahlberg’s Victor Sullivan, even if their antagonists are pretty forgettable and the story never thinks outside the treasure chest box. This should be effective in introducing the world of Uncharted to people who are meeting Nate and friends for the first time, although the changes it makes can be inexplicable and jarring to those of us who’ve spent many games with these characters.",POSITIVE

It used to be that video game movies were bad because video games didn’t give movies enough to work with; say what you will about Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton’s “Super Mario Bros.,” but they had to do something to flesh out a story that basically amounted to “Italian stereotype runs from left to right.” Nowadays, in an age when interactive epics are so vast and cinematic that Playstation characters are regularly played by movie stars (and sometimes even modeled to resemble major filmmakers), it seems that video game movies are bad because video games give movies way too much to work with. No big screen adaptation of “Uncharted” could ever hope to match the globe-trotting, rope-swinging, plane-exploding excitement of Naughty Dog’s massively popular action-adventure franchise, in which professional treasure hunter Nathan Drake scoured the planet in search of priceless artifacts, searched for every corner of the map for even more priceless information about his long-lost brother, and killed enough faceless henchmen along the way to make John Rambo look like John Oliver. Considering that a live-action remake of “Uncharted 4” would be so expensive that a film studio probably wouldn’t even be able to fund it with all the booty in the fabled pirate utopia of Libertalia, it’s no great disappointment that Sony Pictures’ “Uncharted” — for all of its copious and crappy CGI — is still bound by the limits of a piddling $120 million budget, and too small in scale to even feel like a free piece of DLC. The games felt like adventure movies you could play, and so any “Uncharted” movie was always going to come with a pre-installed sense of redundancy. All an “Uncharted” movie had to accomplish — all that it possibly could accomplish — was to capture the glint and derring-do that helped the series port the spirit of Indiana Jones into the modern world. And while it’s true that the best moments of Ruben Fleischer’s thoroughly mediocre (if not unpleasant) adaptation manage to achieve that goal for three or four entire seconds at a time, this generic multiplex adventure falls so far short of its source material because it fails in the areas where history says it should have been able to exceed it. The areas where movies have traditionally had the upper hand over video games: Characters. Personality. Humor. Humanity! You know, the things that films get for free, and video games have to create through witchcraft. The same things that someone up the ladder decided to leave behind when they took a solid-gold brand like “Uncharted” and turned it into an IMAX-sized chunk of cubic zirconia, resulting in a movie that isn’t just less playable than the game on which it’s based, but less watchable too. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when in this movie’s sordid development process that decision was made, but casting Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan is likely what set it in stone. Bringing the same half-cocked, eyebrow-raised, “Peter Berg probably thinks this is funny” energy to the part of Nathan’s grizzled older partner that he has to any number of other roles over the past 15 years, Wahlberg grounds “Uncharted” in a plug-and-play mode that it never has any hope of escaping. Not that credited screenwriters Rafe Lee Judkins and the team of Matt Holloway and Art Marcum — the same Matt Holloway and Art Marcum who wrote the “Transformers” sequel in which Wahlberg learns that the Autobots were once helped by Harriet Tubman — give the actor much help. On the one hand, Sully gets the best line in the movie. On the other hand, that line is about Sully realizing he’s in a Papa John’s. Needless to say, the character’s relationship with Nathan never gets any deeper than “the real treasure was the father figures we made along the way,” and often strains to sell even that. For his part, “Spider-Man: No Way Home” actor Tom Holland does a fine job of playing a courageous young New Yorker who always does the right thing in the face of potentially corruptive opportunities, the only problem is that Peter Parker doesn’t belong in this story. De-aging Nathan Drake from the flinty Nathan Fillion type he was in the games was always going to be a curveball in service of the movie’s chronology — this “Uncharted” is an all-too-accessible origin story, and therefore a prequel to the games — but the good-natured cockiness and critic-shaming bulk that he brings to the role aren’t enough to offset the feeling that his version of the character is just an overgrown kid. I had to suspend my disbelief to buy that Nathan is old enough for a job at the swanky bar where he works at the beginning of the film, let alone ready to zip around the world in search of Ferdinand Magellan’s lost gold and kill whatever henchmen get in his way; when Nathan meets the villainous Spanish billionaire Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas doing very Antonio Banderas things) at a fancy auction for high-priced MacGuffins, I half-expected the bad guy to laugh this fresh-faced Zoomer right out of the room. The unfortunate effect of Holland’s casting is that it roots “Uncharted” in Marvel territory during the rare non-superhero tentpole that might offer multiplex audiences a reprieve from that world. The mere sound of Holland apologizing to the first red shirt he offs in the film’s wonderfully high-flying cold open (a setpiece so fun that Fleischer revisits it again later) is enough to cement the Spider-Man of it all for the next two hours, and the movie’s utter denial of blood and sex only deepen that connection. Despite being half-naked whenever he isn’t soaking through a shirt that must have been sewn with some kind of magical elven fabric that never dries, Holland exudes all the danger and animal magnetism of Tin-Tin. Even when Nathan and his slippery rival Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali) are forced to share a hotel room together, they are conspicuously never seen in the bed at the same time. No one was asking for “Uncharted” to be some kind of unfettered NC-17 fuck-fest — this isn’t a Netflix movie about Marilyn Monroe or anything — but the sheer edgelessness of its lead performance reflects the entire tone of a movie that aims to be as plastic as possible at all times. Fleischer’s competently anonymous direction contributes to the film’s general flavorlessness, as Nathan and Sully chase new clues to the treasure’s whereabouts (and to the location of Nathan’s missing brother) from Barcelona to the Philippines without any sense of urgency or purpose. Set pieces are so hectic and slathered in CGI that you’d eventually trade a Spanish galleon full of gold for a single clear wide shot, which is all the more frustrating because the film’s small handful of action sequences are conceived with more imagination than any recent “Fast & Furious” movie has been able to muster. It doesn’t help that the entire third act is dulled by insultingly under-thought mini-bosses. Moncada’s goons include Steven Waddington as a henchman whose sole trait is “being Scottish,” plus the wildly overqualified Tati Gabrielle as a radiant femme fatale whose only motivation is to get in Nathan’s way. But the climactic setpiece boasts a high-flying sense of fun, even if Fleischer’s best efforts only serve to indicate how exciting this all might have been with more lucid staging and better visual effects. Perhaps the film’s Walmart approach to its action would’ve been more forgivable if the “Uncharted” games weren’t so frequently suffused with Spielbergian flair, just as the film’s archetypal characters may have been less underwhelming had the games not managed to establish 10 times the pathos with none of the same flesh and blood. Then again, anyone who still thinks a mega-budget movie will be as cinematic as the video game on which it’s based only has themselves to blame.

"Feb 15, 2022"," This weekend, you’ll be able to go to theaters and see a highly entertaining thrill ride of a movie, featuring Tom Holland performing death-defying stunts and spending a good portion of the film’s running time engaging in witty banter and flying through the air. Oh, there’s also Uncharted, the feature film version of the hit PlayStation video game series, starring Holland as globe-trotting, history-obsessed treasure hunter Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as Victor “Sully” Sullivan, Nathan’s shady mentor. The film deviates from the video games in a number of ways, being an origin story featuring younger versions of the beloved characters. And if you’re thinking that Wahlberg once would have been a great choice to play Nathan himself, you’re not alone. The film has been in development for so many years that he was formerly attached to play the role until he eventually aged out of it. Resembling the love child of Tomb Raider, Raiders of the Lost Ark and National Treasure, Uncharted definitely feels like a video game adaptation, so rapidly segueing from one elaborate action set piece to another that your fingers may start twitching while watching it.  Director Ruben Fleischer knows his way around this sort of material, having previously helmed such movies as Venom and Zombieland, and he understands that the target audience isn’t particularly interested in deep characterizations or sophisticated dialogue. Still, it would have been nice if screenwriters Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway had come up with something more interesting than this generic adventure in which Nate and Sully team up to first commit a robbery at a high-end auction house and then head to exotic locales in search of Ferdinand Magellan’s lost treasure of gold. Or more interesting villains than the ruthless Santiago Moncada, played by Antonio Banderas in a performance that can best be described as detached. Or wittier exchanges than Sully constantly teasing Nate about his gum-chewing and Nate responding in kind about Sully’s habit of leaving too many open apps on his cell phone. More problematically, Nate and Sully, mutually supportive in the games, here come across like a bickering couple on the verge of divorce. Wahlberg’s Sully looks and behaves disgruntled so much of the time that you begin to wonder how these two went on to form a long-running partnership. (Or maybe the actor was just annoyed at disappearing from the story for long stretches of time.) This star vehicle doesn’t exactly feel like a stretch for Holland, since his Nate, an expert pickpocket, is basically a more larcenous Peter Parker minus the web-spinning — at one point, he apologizes to a bad guy he’s just sent plummeting to his death, which is exactly what Peter would do. As made evident by his many shirtless scenes, the actor clearly buffed up for the role, the better to perform the numerous high-octane stunts that include falling out of an airplane and a lengthy parkour-style foot chase. The film features plenty of photogenic real-life locations and some genuinely exciting action sequences, including the aforementioned airplane scene — which opens the film and is reprised later on — and a breathless battle involving airborne 16th-century sailing ships. Refreshingly, it’s the female characters who are the most badass. Sully’s longtime treasure hunting associate Chloe Frazer (a charismatic Sophie Ali) more than keeps up with the guys when it comes to physical derring-do, and Moncado’s blade-wielding henchwoman Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, fearsome) is a homicidal villainess who could give James Bond a run for his money. You can’t say that the makers of Uncharted lack confidence, since the film ends with the sort of cliffhanger that basically promises a sequel. It’s a bold move, considering the number of video game film adaptations that have crashed and burned, but with the charismatic Holland as its star, it just may pay off.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," It’s a rather impressive feat to bury Tom Holland’s considerable charisma, though that is one of the few aspects where his new film “Uncharted” actually succeeds. Based on the popular video game series (which somewhat dooms it from the start) and directed by Ruben Fleischer (“Zombieland”), the vanilla action adventure (★★ out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) is an Indiana Jones knockoff that pretty much misses everything “Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did well. As young fortune hunter Nathan Drake, Holland takes off the Spider-Man mask and embraces daring stunt scenes a la Tom Cruise, but it’s all for naught in this uninspired triviality that does just enough interesting things to be frustrating. Nate is a New York bartender with a big brain who can tell you everything you need to know about the history of the Negroni cocktail but also has a tendency to steal stuff. He meets Sully (Mark Wahlberg), a guy who specializes in “private acquisitions” (aka he steals ancient stuff) and also knows Nate’s big brother Sam. Nate was separated from his sibling a decade ago and has been receiving postcards from various locales around the world since. Sully tells Nate that he and Sam were partners tracking the infamous lost gold from Magellan’s 16th-century trip around the world when Sam vanished. Using an old diary and some important artifacts, Sully and Nate embark on a globetrotting quest to find the treasure as well as Sam. The journeymen run into Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), a fellow adventurer who doesn’t trust Sully and thus is wary of Nate as well. Their main foe is Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), whose family financed Magellan’s trip back in the day and now wants the loot for himself, though he tends to disappear too often to be a proper villain. Much more dangerous is relentless mercenary leader Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), one of the better characters in this international affair. Nate, Sully and Chloe piece together various clues to find the treasure and naturally stumble into every sort of deadly situation one can imagine. Mid-air conversations on top of a falling car? Sure! Airborne sailing ships? Yep, that’s a thing. There are a few scenes that at least feel a little fresh – including one involving a fire-breathing bit in a dance club – but mainly it’s a whole bunch of far-fetched sequences with C-grade special effects where even James Bond would be like, “Come on, lads, this is too much.” Wahlberg does his usual sarcastic schtick here opposite Holland, which would be all right except brotherly bickering and nonstop one-liners are what count for character development in “Uncharted.” None of the characters are all that likable – again, Holland does what he can but Nate’s personality is all over the place – and there’s so much double- and triple-crossing that you wonder who you’re supposed to be rooting for way too often. Not that strong personalities and deep-rooted themes are the point here – if you want that out of a Holland movie, go see “Spider-Man: No Way Home.” This is the launching of what hopes to be an “Uncharted” movie franchise (with end-credits scenes and everything), full of Easter eggs for gamers and a shiny young new hero to maybe one day inherit Indy’s big-screen mojo.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," I try to go into every movie with open eyes and an open mind, but I confess that this Buddhist goal can be seriously tested by the prospect of sitting through a video-game movie. Sorry, but I’ve been burned too often — by “Super Mario Bros.” (the first one out of the gate, back in 1993), by “Street Fighter” and “Mortal Kombat” and their sequels, by the 637 “Resident Evil” films, by the operatic death-plunge bombast of “Assassins’ Creed,” which looked like it was adapted from the 100 greatest prog-rock album covers. Are there good video-game movies? I enjoyed the 2018 reboot of “Tomb Raider.” The audiences for these films, who tend to be steeped in the games, would say that any number of them are good. But for those like me, who are looking at the movies as movies rather than live-action adjuncts, there can be a sludgy sameness to them: the kinetic fight-club visuals, the skeletal scripts, the “world-building” that starts to look like a series of digital-production-design show reels. But “Uncharted,” based on the Naughty Dog game whose first installment dropped on PlayStation in 2007, is at least trying for something. It’s built around an appealing pair of actors: Tom Holland, who I think registers more vividly as he grows less boyish (he’s in a more rough-and-tumble mode here), and Mark Wahlberg, who knows how to play a hard-ass who is also a trickster. (It’s no insult to Wahlberg to say that his intelligence is his secret weapon.) Holland is Nate Drake, the valiant but naïve adventurer hero, and Wahlberg is Victor Sullivan, who becomes Nate’s mentor by recruiting him to go on a mission to find the legendary stash of gold, which is essentially pirate booty, that was discovered 500 years ago during the around-the-world expedition of Ferdinand Magellan. Can you say “Raiders of the Lost National Treasure of the Fast & Furious Caribbean”? “Uncharted” opens on one of those leap-ahead-to-the-middle-of-the-story moments, so that the film can entice us with its most astonishing sequence: an unintentional airplane escape, with Nate, having fallen out of the plane, shimmying across a roped chain of bulky oversize packing cubes, each equipped with a parachute — a sequence that may sound standard, but the technology for this kind of thing has advanced, so that it’s done in a seemingly all-in-one-shot breathless way, until you could swear that Tom Holland is actually thousands of feet up in the air, hanging on with one finger. It’s the kind of sequence that makes the video-game-movie skeptic in me sit back and say, “Okay, cool, I’ll go with this.” Back on the ground, before all that happened, Nate is a New York bartender who’s also a pickpocket and a loner, because he grew up in the St. Francis Boys Orphanage with his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), who got kicked out, leaving the 10-year-old Nate to fend for himself. When Wahlberg’s Sully shows up out of the blue, it’s not really a coincidence — all the connections in the movie trace back to Nate’s vanished sibling — but these two are still thrown together as if they’d been assigned to the same cop car. “Uncharted” is a buddy movie that takes place in the air, on the water, and in tombs with mechanical puzzle entrances tucked away in the catacombs of Barcelona. In a fun early sequence, Nate and Sully infiltrate an auction so they can steal its prize antique: a dripped-gold ruby-studded key that looks like an ornate cross. There are two of the keys out there, and for them to work you need both. The pair’s rival in all this is Santiago Moncada, whose ancestors funded the Magellan mission; he’s played by Antonio Banderas, who glowers in one-dimensional villain mode. “Uncharted” is essentially an action thriller about two lethally competing scavenger-hunt teams. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, who made “Venom” and the “Zombieland” films, the movie is less obviously video-game-ish than most entries in the genre. Yet after the initial fireworks, you begin to see the design of the thing. “Uncharted” must have looked like a natural movie to make, because the game it’s based on is so “cinematic.” But what that means, in practice, is that the game crossbreeds legendary movie tropes in an abstract way, and when they’re adapted back to the big screen the abstraction is still there. “Uncharted” is a lively but thinly scripted and overlong mad-dash caper movie, propelled by actors you wish, after a while, had more interesting things to say and do. In a scene that takes place in a bedroom between Nate and Chloe (Sophia Ali), who has the other golden cross, I was struck by how the movie makes a point of showing off the very buff Holland, but what would have been a romance a decade ago is now…not a romance. (Maybe it’s set to become one?) I’m not saying the film needed a cliché love story to snuggle up against its other clichés, but at least it would have been an additional element. The vibe of “Uncharted” is breathless and a bit neutral. I chuckled at the Scottish hooligan (Steven Waddington) with a brogue so thick that Nate has to ask him to repeat his threats just so he can understand them, and I enjoyed the playful way Wahlberg suggests that his character might be a scoundrel. The climax, in which Magellan’s ancient ships are hoisted into the Philippines by bottomless helicopters, is both absurd and spectacular — a nice combo. But if you sit through the credits, you get not one but two separate preview sequences, the second one hidden like an Easter Egg. I don’t know if I’d call that presumptuous, but I’d definitely call it optimism.",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," I’ll be the first to admit that I know very little about the video game on which Uncharted is based, except that I know that it’s been a Sony Playstation exclusive while I’ve mostly been an XBox guy. (Where is the Overwatch movie already?!) In other words, if you’re looking for the definitive review comparing the movie to games, then sorry, kids. This ain’t it. Feel free to go to IGN for that. On paper, this one could go either way. It stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, both whom I generally like, and I could say the same for director Ruben Fleischer’s work when given the right script and cast – as he was with Zombieland and its sequel. Going into Uncharted without much in terms of background knowledge or expectations, Holland plays Nathan Drake, a petty thief and history buff whose older brother Sam left Nathan when he was 10 to go out on his own adventures. In the present day, Nathan still has dreams of adventuring, specifically looking for Magellan’s fabled gold cache. He runs into Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a rather crooked gold hunter who wants to use Nathan’s knowledge and skills to find the gold. But they’re not the only people looking for that fortune worth billions, as Antonio Banderas’ already-wealthy Santiago Moncada also wants to get his hands on it, as does the deadly Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and Sully’s sometime-accomplice Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who has the other necessary key to find the gold. None of them trust anyone else and for good reason. Oh, and before we get into all that, we meet Nate as he’s hanging high in the sky outside a cargo plane hooked onto said cargo as it’s flying out the back, but we’ll get back to what is already an impressive set piece in time. First, we have to meet the aforementioned characters and learn more about them. The good thing is that most people will already know and like Holland from the Spider-Man movies, and that charm and sense of humor carries over to Drake. In fact, there’s a few moments in Uncharted where you can see Holland mirroring a young Tom Cruise, between doing those aerial stunts, some impressive juggling behind the bar ala Cocktail era Cruise, and also doing a lot of running, another Cruise mainstay. (In fact, Holland is about the same age as Cruise when he was in Top Gun, The Color of Money, and yes, Cocktail.) Holland effortlessly slips into a different type of action as easily as he does the Spider-suit with a combination of parkour and straight-up fist fighting, though never acting like the tough guy in the room. Holland works particularly well, because he’s well-paired with Wahlberg, as they take verbal shots at each other, but also with Ali, who I thought was just fantastic in one of two pretty decent female roles, as the two women get just as much into the action as the guys. I’m not sure if either of these characters are from the games, but regardless, they work well enough that they frequently steal scenes from the two more famous stars. Although Banderas is great at playing sleazy money, Gabrielle is equally terrific as the film’s other villain, who is by no means secondary.  The film does face a few hurdles as it transitions back and forth from action to puzzle-solving, but I never lost interest in the story being told or how it was being told. As mentioned, I’ve generally liked most of Fleischer’s work as a director (not Venom), but he does particularly impressive work here from all the action set pieces, including a third act climax that will look just amazing on the larger screen format like IMAX. He has a great partner in cinematographer Chung-hoon Chung, who last shot Edgar Wright’s Last Night in Soho, and whose kinetic camerawork does a great job capturing all the jaw-dropping locations and action. Ramin Djawadi’s score is great as always, just perfectly suited to everything the story entails. Maybe the results aren’t quite up to the first National Treasure, but Uncharted is so much better than all three Tomb Raider movies – though that probably wouldn’t be very hard. Ultimately, it’s an energetic first foray into a world of action and adventure I hope fares well enough to see more of these characters. It’s all about fans of this sort of international action-adventure genre getting off their butts and getting to the movie theater this weekend, I guess..",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," As video games have seen massive increases in budget, and thus graphical ability, they have become as cinematic as most movies. And one could argue that Naughty Dog’s adventure franchise, Uncharted, is the most cinematic of all. So why was it so hard to adapt it for the big screen? Literally, this adaptation has been in the works so long that we’ve lived to see Mark Wahlberg go from being cast as young treasure seeker Nathan Drake to instead playing his much-older mentor, Victor “Sully” Sullivan. After the long wait and loads of production woes, the final version of Uncharted hits on many of the swashbuckling thrills provided by the game, but not much else. The long delay might’ve been for the better, as it allowed Tom Holland to take over as Nathan Drake. And who doesn’t love Tom Holland, seriously? Nathan is something of a scamp; a petty criminal with quick hands and a bartender prone to winning over patrons with extensive history lessons. The kid knows his stuff, and that puts him on the radar of Sully, who recruits him for a dangerous mission to find Magellan’s lost treasure. Why Nathan? Because the quest once involved Nathan’s long-lost older brother, Sam, the siblings descended from the great explorer Sir Francis Drake. Of course, there are villains also seeking this lost pirate booty. Antonio Banderas once again plays an evil rich dude (think his Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard role), Moncada, who hopes to restore his family legacy.  Sabrina badass Tati Gabrielle plays his murderous heavy, Braddock, who might know something about Sam’s fate. This is one of those films where nobody can trust anybody, and so we also have franchise regular Chloe Frazer, played by Sophia Ali, who never met a double-cross she didn’t like. Although more than half a dozen directors tried their hand at Uncharted, it was Venom filmmaker Ruben Fleischer who ended up with the gig. His job should be pretty easy given the likable cast and game’s obvious Hollywood influences. The film actually begins by teasing its most impressive setpiece, with Nathan dangling thousands of feet in the air attached to loose cargo hanging from a plane. It’s an impressive sequence when seen in full, with Holland showing an impressively believable physicality and agility, no surprise given his Spider-Man roots. He fights with the speed of a cat, swinging from the ceiling and flipping over tables; he even swings a pirate sword and fires cannonballs like a champ. It’s a fun role, and Fleischer shoots Holland like a star. It’s funny, though, how much this is still a Mark Wahlberg vehicle. While Holland gets the bulk of the attention, the coolest lines and moments belong to Wahlberg, almost like he’s still the star when he’s obviously not. Wahlberg’s influence extends to the relationship between Sully and Nathan. Let’s be honest, Wahlberg plays exactly one type of character and when he’s in a two-hander like this, it’s especially true. So it’s unsurprising that the back and forth between Sully and Nathan sounds a lot like the banter in 2 Guns, or The Other Guys, or Spenser Confidential. On the other side, Holland’s version of Nathan is basically him doing Peter Parker. Gone is Nathan’s trademark grit and steeliness, which might irk die-hards, but this is more in Holland’s wheelhouse. Also very good is Tati Gabrielle, whose Braddock is devious, cunning, and more than just a hired goon. She’s got screen presence to spare and I hope to see her in bigger roles in other films of this scale. Drawing inspiration from a couple of the Uncharted games, the story is pretty straight forward. The games are basically Tomb Raider with a dude; lots of puzzles and riddles and far too much exposition, like someone watched The Da Vinci Code once too often when they should’ve paid more attention to National Treasure. Between the action scenes, Uncharted gets bogged down by dialogue that sounds like a Wikipedia entry, while at the same time failing to sell us on the partnership between Nathan and Sully. Neither character is fleshed out with enough detail, and that goes double for their supporting cast. They want us to buy into the “thieves’ romance” between Nathan and Chloe, but there’s no steam behind it. Maybe in later movies. Uncharted really earns its money in the gigantic final act that finds Nathan and Sully fighting aboard treasure-filled pirate vessels swinging from soaring helicopters. It’s a breathtaking, eye-popping finale worth the price of admission, and it makes you wonder what future sequels will do to top it. With Holland and Wahlberg aboard, the plan is clearly to build a franchise that can rival the video games. While the film doesn’t hit on all cylinders the way playing Uncharted at home on your console does, daring, high adventure is a rare find on the big screen nowadays so best to sit back and enjoy it.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," Culture Representation: Taking place in New York City, Boston, Spain and the Philippines, the action film “Uncharted” features a predominantly white cast of characters (with a few African Americans, Latinos and Asians) representing the working-class, middle-class and wealthy. Culture Clash: A 25-year-old American man who’s had a longtime obsession with finding Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s legendary gold fortune teams up with two cynical art thieves—a middle-aged man and a woman in her 20s— to find this treasure. Culture Audience: “Uncharted” will appeal mainly to people who are fans of stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, because their on-screen appeal is one of the few highlights of this messy and idiotic action flick. Even by standards of suspending disbelief for far-fetched action movies, “Uncharted” is still a disjointed and disappointing mess that thinks it’s funnier and better than it really is. Not even the on-screen charisma of stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg can save this movie from being relentlessly moronic, with sloppily staged stunts, characters with cardboard personalities, and a storyline that often drags. Unfortunately, “Uncharted” is just another in a long list of movies based on video games that fail to improve on the video game in a cinematic way. Nate (who is not a superhero with superhuman abilities) is able make leaps and bounds in the air, like he’s Spider-Man, a character played by Holland in other movies. Maybe the filmmakers of “Uncharted” think that just because Holland is Spider-Man in other movies, audiences are supposed to believe any human character that Holland plays in another movie can magically have Spider-Man-like powers too. It just makes this movie (and its visual effects) look even more absurd. As Nathan bounces around and leaps unrealistically from box to box in the air, a red Mercedes 300 Gullwing suddenly starts barreling out of the airplane directly toward Nate. Someone then grabs Nate’s hand, but the movie then does a dissolve edit to show a flashback to 15 years earlier in Boston, when Nate’s older brother Sam grabs Nate’s hand to prevent him from falling from a building. In the last third of the movie “Uncharted” circles back to the airplane scene by showing what caused Nate to fall out of that plane. In this flashback, 10-year-old Nate (played by Tiernan Jones) and Sam (played by Rudy Pankow), who’s about five or six years older than Nate, are breaking into a museum at night to steal what is purported to be the very first map of the world. The screenplay for “Uncharted” (written by Rafe Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway) is so shambolic, it never really explains why these two brothers want to steal this priceless art. Is it a prank? Is it to sell the map on the black market? Is it because they think they can keep the map like a trophy and are too stupid to know better? Whatever their reasons are for this inept break-in, Nate and Sam are quickly apprehended by security guards. Nate and Sam are orphans whose parents have gone missing and are presumed dead. They are living in an orphanage run by Catholic nuns. Because Sam has been in trouble before, and now has “three strikes against him,” he’s kicked out of the orphanage and is expected to be held in a juvenile detention center. For whatever reason that’s never explained in the movie, Nate escapes any punishment. Sam runs away from the orphanage the night before he’s supposed to be taken into custody. Before he leaves, Sam gives Nate his most cherished possession: a brass ring on a chain, as proof that he has an incentive to see Nate again. Sam tells Nate: “I’ll come back for you, Nate. I promise.” Nate hasn’t seen Sam in person since that night. Nate and Sam are history buffs who are obsessed with the legend of a gold fortune hidden in the 1500s by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. As children, they planned for years to go looking for this treasure when they got old enough to do so. But this separation has put a big halt to those plans.  The same night, after the lounge has closed, a customer sitting at a table refuses to leave. He introduces himself as Victor “Sully” Sullivan (played by Wahlberg), and he tells Nate that he wants to hire Nate for an adventurous job. Nate is suspicious, but he takes Victor’s business card, which lists Victor’s address, phone number and business title as “Private Acquisitions.” Out of curiosity, Nate shows up unannounced to the address on the card. Victor is there, and that’s how Nate finds out that Victor collects valuable and historical artifacts, most of which are stolen. And that’s not all: Victor knows Sam, whom he says he hasn’t seen or heard from in about two years. “He ghosted me,” Victor says about Sam. Victor is also interested in finding Magellan’s gold treasure, which is valued at about $5 billion. Victor has sought out Nate because Victor figures that Sam might have left some clues for Nate to find this treasure. Victor suggests to Nate that if they both team up to find the gold together, there’s a chance they’ll also find Sam. Does that make any sense? Of course not, but Nate goes along with it anyway, mainly because Victor has the money and resources to finance this trip. But not so fast, Nate. Victor is skeptical that Nate has what it takes for some of the violence that’s sure to come with this job. Victor sees Nate as just a nerdy young guy who might be too sheltered and inexperienced to be an effective partner for Victor. And so, Victor wants Nate to pass a test.  There’s an upcoming auction of rare Spanish art from the Renaissance era. Victor’s plan is to steal a jewel-encrusted crucifix at this auction. And he wants Nate to be his accomplice. And this auction leads Victor and Nate to encounter the two chief villains in the story. At the auction are two people who will stop at nothing to get this crucifix too. Santiago Moncada (played by Antonio Banderas) is a wealthy Spanish collector who’s the heir to a family fortune. But not for long, because Santiago’s father Armando Moncada (played by Manuel de Blas) has recently announced that he’s giving away the family fortune to charity. Santiago, who’s the head of the Moncada Foundation, is infuriated by this decision, but Armando remains unmoved by Santiago’s pleas to change his mind. “I should have cut you off years ago,” Armando tells Santiago with disgust. The other person who’s at the auction to get the crucifix is a mysterious and shady mercenary named Jo Braddock (played by Tati Gabrielle), who wants to be called by her last name. Braddock used to be romantically involved with Victor, but he broke up with her. She’s very bitter about it, so there’s an extra reason why she wants to beat Victor at his own game. It’s briefly mentioned that when Braddock and Victor were romantically involved with each other, she was his partner in crime too. The auction devolves into one of many of the movie’s ridiculous fight scenes, where people with weapons spend too much time trading insults when they could easily defeat their opponent by using the weapons. And even though Braddock has combat skills, she unrealistically defeats several armed people who are much taller and stronger than she is when they gang up on her in a group. In reality, anyone would be easily defeated when being the only person to fight a group of at least five or six armed and dangerous people. Victor and Nate soon find out there’s someone else who wants the crucifix too. She’s a skilled thief named Chloe Frazer (played by Sophia Ali), who’s also looking for Magellan’s treasure. Victor already knows Chloe, since they’ve been rivals in previous art thefts. Predictably, Nate and Chloe have an instant dislike of each other, which turns into mutual attraction, which they try to fight/deny/suppress in a cliché “will they or won’t they get together” subplot. Nate and Chloe have a hard time trusting each other, since one of them could betray the other at any moment. Victor, Nate and Chloe team up for a flimsy reason explained in the movie. Their shenanigans take them to Spain and the Philippines, two landmark destinations for Magellan’s voyage around the world. The villains are never far behind, of course. Santiago wants Magellan’s treasure too, because he claims it was stolen from the Moncada family. The bombastic and moronic fight scenes that would kill people in real life will have viewers wondering by the middle of the movie: “How are these characters still alive?” Victor and Nate’s reluctant partnership just rehashes the over-used movie stereotype of “the grouchy older guy who’s annoyed with the eager younger guy, but they have to find a way to work together.” On the way to the auction that’s shown in the beginning of the movie, Victor ridicules Nate for chewing bubblegum at this black-tie, formal event. The bubblegum comes in handy though, when Nate uses it to prop open a door to a room that can only be accessed through an electronic system. Victor keeps calling Nate a “kid” in a condescending manner, which gets very tiresome, very quickly. There’s a scene shown in one of the trailers for “Uncharted” where Victor has a newly grown moustache. Nate asks Victor, while pointing and grinning, “What is that thing on your face?” Victor replies, “Puberty’s right around the corner, kid. You can grow your own.” It’s more than a little ridiculous that Victor treats a 25-year-old Nate as if Nate is a pre-pubescent child, but that’s what you’re going to see while Victor and Nate exchange unfunny jokes that fall flat.  The movie also tries to have “cutesy” banter between Victor and Nate. An example is when Nate tells Victor during an action scene: “You can get shot in the head, or you can come down here for a cuddle.” Fortunately, the stale and witless dialogue between Victor and Nate isn’t in the majority of “Uncharted,” because there’s a long stretch of the movie where Nate and Chloe work together without Victor being around at all. In addition to having cringeworthy dialogue, “Uncharted” has very phony-looking production design. Hidden tunnels and hidden caves that are supposed to show signs of rot and decay instead look like very polished and overly staged movie sets. This lack of authenticity is very distracting and just makes “Uncharted” look too glossy instead of being the gritty action flick that it should have been. “Uncharted” takes a steep nosedive into stupidity with too many action scenes that would cause death or serious injuries in real life, but the characters barely show any signs of being affected. One of the worst is a scene where Chloe and Nate plunge deep into the ocean as a result of falling from high above in the air. When they emerge after being thrashed around by deadly waves, they have no injuries, their clothes are still fully intact, and Chloe still has full makeup on. As much as Holland tries to inject some fun into his Nate character, Holland is just doing an older version of the teenage Peter Parker character that he plays in the “Spider-Man” movies. Wahlberg’s portrayal of Victor is just recycling the same sarcastic grump character that Wahlberg has played in dozens of other movies. Banderas hams it up as a generic villain, which is essentially a shallower version of the wealthy villain he played in the obnoxiously bad 2021 action flick “The Hitman’s Wife’s Bodyguard.” Ali’s portrayal of Chloe is adequate, but Ali is stymied by the filmmakers not letting Chloe be a fully developed person but just a character to do stunts and trade sardonic quips with Nate and Victor. Chloe tells a little bit of a backstory about herself to explain why she has a hard time trusting people, but this background information is literally a brief mention that seems like a half-hearted attempt to try give Chloe more depth. As for Gabrielle’s Braddock character, she has no depth at all and has some of the worst lines in this terrible movie. The characters are boring villains and superficial heroes. This horribly edited movie also tends to drag and get repetitive. An epilogue and mid-credits scene make it obvious that the “Uncharted” filmmakers want to make a sequel. “Uncharted” is such a horrendous dud, any plans for an “Uncharted” movie series should be left permanently off of the movie industry map, but good taste never gets in the way of filmmakers who want to make millions from churning out garbage movies.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," In the tradition of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” “The Mummy,” “National Treasure” and “Jumanji,” “Uncharted” taps into a familiar tradition of globe-trotting, roguish adventure, and disguises the influence of those earlier films (and countless others) considerably better than you might expect.  Since making his debut with “Zombieland,” director Ruben Fleischer has developed an aptitude for cheerful proficiency (if not a ton of discernible personality) that he deploys to great effect in this brisk pastiche, especially with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg bickering their way through one set piece after another.  Meanwhile, Sophia Ali and Tati Gabrielle steal much of the movie from their better-known co-stars with intriguing turns as competitors and more-than-equals for the prize Fleischer keeps tantalizingly out of reach from all of them. An adaptation the Playstation video game of the same name, “Uncharted” stars Holland as Nathan Drake, an orphan obsessed with 16th-century explorers; he grows up to become a bartender and pickpocket after his older brother, Sam (Rudy Pankow), abandons him in childhood to avoid arrest. While living vicariously through the postcards Sam sends him from exotic, faraway lands, Nathan gets contacted by Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Wahlberg), a fortune hunter seeking his help to locate a treasure supposedly lost during Magellan’s trip around the world. Nathan reluctantly agrees in the hopes the journey will somehow reconnect him and his brother, but they soon run afoul of Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas), the son of a wealthy industrialist who wants to find Magellan’s gold for himself. Collaborating with Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali, “Grey’s Anatomy”), Nathan and Sully soon find themselves combing the streets of Barcelona looking for clues that might point to the location of the gold. But if Moncada’s limitless resources and ruthless determination don’t present big enough obstacles for the scrappy fortune-hunting trio, he also hires Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, “You”), a former colleague of Sully’s, to match wits — and if necessary, weapons — with them to retrieve the treasure. Like many of the performers that the Marvel Cinematic Universe catapulted to stardom seemingly overnight, Holland possesses an undeniable charisma and a sincerity on screen that makes him tirelessly likable, even when Nathan is pickpocketing a young customer at the bar where he works. Here, he possesses an almost Harold Lloyd–like quality where each of his stunts feel improvised and effortless at the same time, combined with an inner incredulity that he’s pulled off yet another feat of derring-do.  In fact, the only thing Holland seemingly cannot do is generate chemistry with Wahlberg as Sully, a counterpart and proxy brother with whom Nathan should be irresistibly clashing; instead, he limps through their interactions like scripted awards-show presentation banter. Wahlberg shrewdly takes a back seat to Holland in the film, but his buddy-comedy bona fides flourish more when he’s pitted against a type that pushes him outside of his comfort zone. He seems unable to decide if Sully is truly a scoundrel, or actually a nice guy pretending to be tough, and it results in a toothless performance that creates no friction for Holland’s character, even after we discover a secret connection to Nathan’s brother’s fate. As the third member of their team, Ali isn’t altogether convincing as a hard-shell fortune hunter toughened up by a life of loneliness and betrayal, but in comparison to Wahlberg, she and Holland have chemistry for days, and some of the film’s best sequences occur when the two of them share the screen. As Jo Braddock, meanwhile, Gabrielle is unfortunately saddled with an almost comically dopey villain role — there’s no opportunity to accomplish a task that she won’t tackle from the most counterintuitive approach possible — but she’s so magnetic on screen, whether she’s groveling to Banderas or pummeling Wahlberg, that you can’t take your eyes off of her. Suffice it to say that action movies as a genre mostly abandoned the basic principles of physics long ago, but “Uncharted” indulges in some of the most preposterous sequences put on screen in a long time. No matter how skilled Holland might be at actually performing (or seeming to perform) Nathan’s parkour-influenced fighting style, the movie just keeps escalating the danger over and over without bothering to bring along a sense of danger or urgency. For example, a climb up a group of tethered equipment pallets hanging out of the back of a mid-air DC-10 was perhaps obviously always going to be silly, but Fleischer sacrifices suspense for momentum, so the scene becomes a showcase for the imagination of the film’s visual effects team instead of the characters we’re supposed to care about.  All of that said, it’s one of the first times I’ve watched a movie and thought “I’d like to play that game,” which may be a dubious accomplishment, but it speaks to the movie’s ultimate aims: namely, to re-create the serialized, task-oriented nature of its source material, which of course was cribbed liberally from the films listed above and the serials that in turn inspired them.  Four decades after Indiana Jones was dragged behind a truck, Nathan Drake aspires to be his next-generation counterpart — which is why only being towed behind an airplane will do. That doesn’t especially make “Uncharted” a great film, but for better or worse, you can probably feel the same level of satisfaction after watching Nathan complete just one or two of its single-serving challenges than in trying to lose yourself in the superficiality of the entire journey.",POSITIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," Nathan (Tom Holland, left) and Chloe (Sophia Ali) search for treasure under the streets of Barcelona, in a scene from the action-adventure “Uncharted.” (Photo by Clay Enos, courtesy of Columbia Pictures.) It would be hard to find a movie that’s as much a generic corporate product as “Uncharted,” a paint-by-numbers action-adventure made by one arm of Sony — Columbia Pictures — based on an intellectual property from another arm of Sony, Playstation., and starring another Sony product, Tom Holland, aka Spider-Man. Holland portrays Nathan Drake, a Manhattan bartender and masterful pickpocket who catches the attention of Victor “call me ‘Sully’” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), a smooth-but-shady procurer of things he’s not supposed to procure. Sully wants Nathan to join him on a quest, to find the legendary lost gold of Ferdinand Magellan’s ill-fated circumnavigation of the globe. Nathan catches on quickly that Sully is not to be trusted. But one thing convinces Nate to sign on: Sully says he knows what happened to Nathan’s brother, Sam — who Nathan hasn’t seen since they were boys, in the orphanage in Boston, getting into trouble and dreaming of adventures like this. (We meet the young brothers — Nate played by Tiernan Jones, Sam played by Rudy Pankow — in the prologue.) The quest begins with Nathan and Sully trying to steal a bejeweled gold crucifix from an auction house, where tycoon Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) is eager to possess it. Moncada, we’re told, is the scion of the family that bankrolled Magellan’s voyage 500 years ago, and he believes it’s his destiny to reclaim the fortune. Moncada hires a knife-wielding operative, Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle, from “The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina”), to keep Nathan and Sully out of his way. After the New York adventure, Nathan and Sully follow the trail to Barcelona — which happens to be Moncada’s base of operations. There, they team up with another thief, Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who knows Sully well enough not to trust him, and assumes Nathan is untrustworthy because he’s with Sully. The bulk of the Barcelona segment involves following clues through an underground maze, with the requisite cobwebs and booby traps. Someone calls someone else “Indiana Jones,” and the audience’s response is: “You wish.” It goes on like this, as director Ruben Fleischer (“Venom,” “Zombieland”) and a tag-team of screenwriters connect the dots from one action set piece to the next. Exactly one of these action sequences is in any way remarkable, and it’s the one that dominates the movie’s trailer: Nathan hanging onto the netting of a line of cargo containers dangling behind the back door of a plane somewhere over the Philippines.  The movie might have had a chance, if screenwriters Rate Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway had given Holland or Wahlberg characters to play instead of one-note cliches — or made Gabrielle’s Braddock something more than an anime figure, or given Banderas anything interesting to work with in his villain role. These aren’t characters, they’re avatars, hollow figures to mark the place someone real should be. And that, I realized after watching “Uncharted,” is the answer to the question Hollywood has been asking for decades: Why movies based on video games never work.  When you play the game, you solve the riddle or win the boss battle, and you get to the next cut scene. If you fail, you keep trying again until you succeed, and the cut scene is waiting for you. A movie like “Uncharted” is all cut scenes, with the action connecting the viewer from one to the next — and where’s the surprise in that? Also, think about it this way: The most interesting character in a video game isn’t Mario or Lara Croft or (for my game of choice, “FIFA 22”) Lionel Messi. The most interesting character is always you, the player. And substituting a movie star in that central role is never as fascinating to you as you are — I don’t care how boyishly handsome Tom Holland is. And when you substitute yourself with a character with no discernible personality, as this movie does with both Holland’s Nate and Wahlberg’s Sully, it’s game over.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," Without exaggeration, we have been writing Uncharted stories on CinemaBlend for a decade. The extremely popular video game franchise begs to be adapted into an Indiana Jones-esque swashbuckler. Hell, the game itself is so cinematic, any director would only have to follow the blueprint laid out by the designers at Naughty Dog to produce just a modest hit. But for reasons unknown, numerous directors taking shots at mounting Uncharted for Sony Pictures came and went, and the seemingly sure-fire entertainer languished in development hell until the studio’s current lucky charm, Tom Holland, agreed to step into the lead role.  Because of the age difference between the current on-screen Spider-Man and Uncharted’s primary hero, Nathan Drake, this first movie is refashioned as a prequel, or early chapter, in the saga of the treasure hunter and his seasoned partner, Sully (Mark Wahlberg). This leads to a lot of narrative background information being mapped out in the movie’s first half. But once Uncharted settles into its treasure-seeking groove, the movie finds its footing, leading to a thrilling third act and the promise of a new successful franchise for Holland and Wahlberg. As someone who religiously played the Uncharted games on my Sony Playstation, I had an idea in my mind of who should play Drake on screen. Firefly fan fave Nathan Fillion, often associated with the part, fit the bill. I even understood the casting of Mark Wahlberg in the Nate role when directors like David O. Russell (The Fighter) circled the project. Because the unshakable reality is that Tom Holland, while gifted and charismatic, is too young to play Drake in the first Uncharted movie. The narrative in the games eventually gets to a point where flashbacks allow one to play as teenage Drake, and I’m sure the majority of players would tell you that the side missions with Kid Drake felt like forced detours we had to endure to get back to the main action. Uncharted has a little bit of that feel as Holland gets used to being Drake, and we get used to seeing him as Drake.  This means audience members who have no history with the game, and just want to see Tom Holland doing his thing, will have less issue with his casting. Because when it comes down to the physicality and the stunt work that accompanies Nathan Drake’s adventures, Holland brings his full skillset to the table. Uncharted director Ruben Fleischer creates as-practical-as-possible set pieces, and it’s clearly Holland doing the stunts, which is admirable once you see what they require. The fresh-faced 25 year old doesn’t convey the scrappy toughness of Drake (or even Indiana Jones, the inspiration for Drake). But he shows enough to prove it’s a role he can grow into.  Uncharted is a popular video game because the gameplay puts Drake (and by extension, the player) into scenarios they’ve never seen in a game before. Drake will find himself in a train car that’s dangling off of a cliff, and has to deduce the only possible way out. It’s pulse-racing… and if you can’t replicate that adrenaline rush on the screen, then why are you even bothering?  The second and third acts of Ruben Fleischer’s move, though, ramp up to the levels of action that the Uncharted game delivered. Two of the movie’s most memorable set pieces were seen in the trailer, one involving crates falling from a plane and the other involving pirate ships being carried by helicopters. The photography and fight choreography in these sequences is stunning, and warrant the bump to an IMAX screening if you are checking Uncharted out at all. It’s in these moments that Holland earns his keep through the physical nature of Drake, but credit goes to screenwriters Art Marcum and Matt Holloway for dreaming up these set pieces, as well as to Flesicher and his team for executing them.  Without giving away any plot details, Uncharted leaves plenty of plot threads that point to the promise of at least one sequel, so long as this first movie finds an audience. Again, those who played all of the Uncharted games will be able to guess some of the places that sequels to this movie can and will go. And when I got to the end of Fleischer’s movie, I found I wanted to continue the narrative, and follow Nate (Holland) and Sully (Wahlberg) on their next quest. The two men might not be the most obvious choices for these recognizable characters, but accept that alteration and the fun of this video game adaptation will carry you through a worthy big-screen adventure.

"Feb 15, 2022"," Uncharted is far from the worst movie you will see this year. However, it is another video game adaptation that fails to adapt the interactive medium to an inactive medium without losing some of the magic that made the source material so good. Director: Ruben Fleischer
Summary: Street-smart Nathan Drake is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada. The thing that tends to make adaptations fail right out of the gate is neglecting to take into consideration how people interact with the media. You don't watch a TV show like you read a book, and you don't watch a play the way you watch a movie. All of these experiences are incredibly different. When it comes to video game adaptations, there is the added hurdle of taking an interactive way of storytelling and making it inactive. If Uncharted were a series that had one of the most unique stories ever, this series wouldn't have such a hard time making itself unique. However, these games have always had an incredibly generic story, which is not an insult to the games. The story being very ""paint by numbers"" allowed the developers to focus on making the gameplay, the graphics, the puzzles, all of the things that make a game a game the best they can possibly be. The story being pretty damn good with some memorable voice performances and set pieces are things that made this series so popular and why they greenlit a movie based on Uncharted in 2008. However, you aren't doing anything but watching when you're watching a movie. You aren't figuring out the next puzzle, you aren't trying to figure out the next clue, you're just watching an actor do that, and the thing that made this series great is lost. What is left is the same treasure hunter story that we've seen a million times before. The story isn't bad, it's fine, but that's all it is, fine. It does nothing to elevate the genre it is attempting to launch a franchise into, but it also doesn't do anything to the detriment of the genre either; it merely exists. If that is all someone wants out of an Uncharted movie, then there is a very good chance that there is plenty here to enjoy. Some of the puzzles are pretty neat; stars Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg have the kind of chemistry where you're not sure if these two guys are about to exchange friendship bracelets or strangle each other. It works more than it doesn't, and while some of the one-liners are a little cringy, it isn't anything bad enough to take you out of the movie by a long shot. Their arcs are just as generic as the rest of the story, but they do a fine job with them. As previously stated, this movie has been in development since 2008, which means people born the year this movie came out are old enough to go see it in theaters. The script has been through rewrites and many different directors, but you wouldn't know that by watching Uncharted. There isn't anything here that feels particularly ""modern"" about this script. If it was the exact same one from 2008, no one would be surprised [even though we know it isn't because the original script was exceptionally far removed from the source material]. The most modern thing about this movie is how it seems to embrace its own source material. In 2008, nerd properties were still a little ashamed to be nerd properties, and today it is considered a mark of pride to be based on a game, comic, or something of the sort. Those things tend to come in the directing and cinematography with a couple of first-person shots that will give you vertigo if you see this in IMAX, and the framing will make fans of the series fingers twitch as they try to make the quick time event work. The action scenes are very good, and it's clear to see why this movie quite literally almost killed its star. There is a clear setup for a franchise with a pre-credits and mid-credits scene, and it's clear that Sony wants to make more of these. However, they don't leave a bunch of dangling plot threads for the said sequel and wrap up this movie's story fairly well. Uncharted took over a decade to make it to the big screen, and it's unclear whether or not it was worth the wait. The things that made the games great are the things that cannot translate to movies. That was always going to be the biggest challenge for this movie to overcome, and it might not have been able to do it no matter how hard they tried. Instead, we got another video game adaptation that fails to stick the landing, but at least this one isn't completely terrible.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022"," This film isn’t the best action-adventure film but I can be very forgiving if I’m having fun. That’s the thing with action-adventures especially when it’s focusing on the adventure of itself. I’m not familiar with the PlayStation game but it never stopped me from having fun. The script isn’t above itself for paying homage to the Indiana Jones films either–replace snakes with nuns and you’ve got a very familiar line. There’s also a reference to the classic line about objects belonging in a museum. In the time since Indiana Jones, you’ve had Lara Croft and others. Perhaps video game fans will like this or maybe they won’t. However, Tom Holland sure knows how to sell his Nathan Drake character. Once Sully and Nathan arrive in Spain, they’re met by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali). The thing about Chloe is we don’t know if she’s working with them or if she’s only looking out for herself. It goes back to the whole issue of trust when it comes to this genre. Sully has Juan Sebastián Elcano’s diary. It’s a race against time to find the treasure in Barcelona before Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and her mercenaries do. Chloe and Jo could not be more different. While we don’t know if we can trust Chloe, Jo is only in it for herself and her actions show it. Just their luck–it’s another clue but one that points them in the right direction to find the missing gold. It all comes to a climax in a not-too-surprising set piece. But then again, we’ve been down this road before in plenty of films. This is the thing with hunting treasures: you don’t know who to trust. At the moment you’re starting to trust someone, you find out that they double-crossed you. When you’ve seen one film of this nature, you know what tropes to expect. The person who used to work for you before switching sides? Check. The person who knows you’re a liar and doesn’t trust you? Check. And this is just starting to go down the checklist while hiding what happens before you see the film. That’s not to say that there aren’t some exciting set pieces along the way! Of course, if you’ve played the game before, this is Nathan Drake’s origin story. But if you haven’t, Uncharted is still an entertaining action-adventure thanks to the chemistry of its cast and what it offers to audiences. Give credit to filmmaker Ruben Fleischer and production designer Shepherd Frankel for going after real sets as much as possible. Blue screens can work when needed but there’s nothing I love more than watching actors in a real set. It’s one of the best things to enjoy about the filmmaking process. They use the real Santa Maria Del Pi and sets when necessary. For Moncada’s headquarters, they turn to a Victorian market called el Born. Interestingly, it’s now an archeological site in real life because they discovered ancient Barcelona upon digging into the foundation.

"Feb 15, 2022"," 
There is a frightening trend in action tentpoles nowadays: when the frame is not being filled with CGI explosions and various stuntmen doing acrobatic flips off camera, it's being filled with quips. Worse yet, they're not even funny quips, but they roll off the tongues of our devastatingly handsome leading men so quickly that you're halfway to chuckling before you register that there wasn't even a joke. Just the semblance of sarcasm and the rhythm of a jab.

I won't point fingers at where this trend started, or say who does it best or who even does it well, but I will say that ""Uncharted,"" the Tom Holland-starring action-adventure flick based on the popular video game series, is the latest film to do it badly.
 There is a frightening trend in action tentpoles nowadays: when the frame is not being filled with CGI explosions and various stuntmen doing acrobatic flips off camera, it's being filled with quips. Worse yet, they're not even funny quips, but they roll off the tongues of our devastatingly handsome leading men so quickly that you're halfway to chuckling before you register that there wasn't even a joke. Just the semblance of sarcasm and the rhythm of a jab. I won't point fingers at where this trend started, or say who does it best or who even does it well, but I will say that ""Uncharted,"" the Tom Holland-starring action-adventure flick based on the popular video game series, is the latest film to do it badly. 
Directed by Ruben Fleischer of ""Zombieland"" fame and penned by Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, ""Uncharted"" shambles along like a reanimated husk of better action-adventure movies before it, filled not with a soul but with jokes and funnies to make up for the fact that we've seen all this before. Like the ""Tomb Raider"" movies before it, and like every treasure-hunting action flick this side of ""Indiana Jones,"" ""Uncharted"" is pretty par-for-the-course for an action-adventure film. There's a spunky protagonist who's unusually adept at puzzles and parkour, there's a long-buried treasure around which centuries of myths have sprung, and there's a globe-trotting quest upon which the protagonist and their grizzled/hot band of fellow adventurers must embark, encountering all kinds of mustache-twirling villains and their henchmen along the way. And while there isn't anything wrong with retreading this genre, ""Uncharted"" doesn't offer anything new. If anything, its similarities to other movies only call greater attention to its shortcomings.

Far from the great heights of the classic ""Indiana Jones"" movies, ""Uncharted"" is closer to ""National Treasure"" without the weirdo energy of Nicolas Cage, mixed with ""The Goonies"" without the childlike irreverence of Amblin. It's glossy, witty, and franchise-ready. Which would be fine if the jokes were good!
And those quips are part of the fabric of the film from the beginning, when the movie opens in medias res, as Holland's Nathan Drake wakes up in midair, his foot tangled in the ropes holding a cargo container that is falling out the back of a plane. A henchman climbs toward him and they tussle, Nathan finally kicking the man in the chest and sending him flying, responding with a panicked, ""Oh my god I'm so sorry that was purely reactive!"" Holland is used to these kinds of guileless quips — he's played Peter Parker for 6 years, after all. But the script struggles to match with Holland's level, giving us unfunny banter about Nathan Drake looking too young to be tending bar (which he is, he's a child), and about how Mark Wahlberg's seasoned fortune hunter Victor ""Sully"" Sullivan has too many apps open on his phone.

As someone unfamiliar with the games upon which ""Uncharted"" is based, I'm told that the games are already pretty funny, but they have to be better than the hollow jokes we get with the ""Uncharted"" movie. If you're going to make your movie 90% quips, at least have them be good. There's only so far that Holland's aw-shucks geniality can carry a movie.

Now that we've got the biggest sin of ""Uncharted"" out of the way, let's turn to the lesser of its sins: the origin story. Like an alarming amount of recent video game movies — ""Tomb Raider,"" ""Mortal Kombat,"" etc. — ""Uncharted"" has decided to go the prequel route with its protagonist, aging down Nathan Drake to a twentysomething Holland, who still seems to be too young to be playing an orphaned bartender-turned-treasure hunter. Which makes it even more ridiculous when the film flashes back 15 years to show an even younger Nathan Drake (somehow not 5 years old?) as he and his older brother dream of finding the long-lost treasure of the Magellan expedition. What is this secret treasure? Well, apparently, the Magellan expedition wasn't actually made with the goal of circumnavigating the globe — it was intended to find gold. And gold they found, burying it deep under the streets of Barcelona. Nathan Drake is recruited on a quest to find this treasure by Sully (a phoning-it-in Wahlberg), who dedicated years of his life to finding the Magellan treasure and was briefly joined by Nathan's brother Sam before he disappeared. Hoping to reunite with his brother and find this mythical treasure, Nathan warily joins forces with Sully and is dragged into a whole new world of backstabbing, billionaire conspiracies, and a surprising amount of falling out of airplanes. He also gets to tangle with a (literally) cutthroat mercenary named Jo (a practically purring Tati Gabrielle, the movie highlight) and a ruthless billionaire treasure hunter (Antonio Banderas, wasted). Throughout all this, it's hard to get a handle on why we should root for Nathan Drake, apart from the fact that he looks like Tom Holland. Before he takes up the treasure-hunting mantle, he's little more than a pickpocket with some fancy bartending skills, and throughout his journey with Sully — where he gets betrayed by Sully, then Sully's acquaintance Chloe (Sophia Ali, doing her best in a fairly thankless role), then Sully again — he takes it all with a stride that is almost superhuman. But, and Holland should know, we don't care as much for the mask as we do the person who wears it. And the movie cares so much about the mask, about the costume and persona of Nathan Drake, that it makes a big to-do of him finally putting on the shirt and the gun holster, and forgets to give us normies a reason to be as invested as all the gamers who love ""Uncharted"" so much. ""Uncharted"" has fun moments — there are spectacular set pieces involving ancient ships being towed through the sky, and the aforementioned cargo-hold fight — but its overreliance on unfunny quips and uninspired retreads of the action-adventure genre makes it another disappointing non-MCU outing for Holland, and another spiritless adaptation of a beloved video game. Unlike its title, ""Uncharted"" finds no new territory for the treasure-hunting flick. In the words of our greatest cinematic treasure hunter, it belongs in a museum.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 15, 2022",Uncharted delivers stale execution of a thrilling video game franchise...the originally charismatic duo of Nathan Drake and Sully become wooden action heroes that aren't able to soar like their video game counterparts.,NEGATIVE
"Feb 15, 2022"," After years in Development Hell, the movie adaptation of the popular video game series Uncharted finally lands in theaters. Venom director Ruben Fleischer has seen Uncharted over the finish line with Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg headlining the adventure flick. But, as is the case with so many video game movies, Uncharted is an odd, disjointed film that features no shortage of big set pieces slathered in CGI, but what it really lacks is a personality. Is this to be the start of a new action franchise? I don’t see much of a future unless the hoards of devoted gamers turn out to the theater to passively watch characters they’re used to actively interacting with. After a flashback to the time 15 years prior when his brother left in the middle of the night, we follow Nathan Drake (Holland) as he works as a bartender in New York City. He’s recruited by Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Wahlberg) to join him in the search for a golden cross that will lead them to lost gold hidden by Magellan that is worth billions today. They’re in competition with the ruthless Santiago Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his lethal underling Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Soon, Nate and Sully will be joined by Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), who also has her own clues leading to the lost gold. However, there’s little trust between anyone in the search for a lost treasure. The plot of Uncharted with Magellan’s lost treasure is notably absurd, yet the film’s ability to just along with it prevents you from giving too much thought to the silliness. But the ability to just kind of gloss over the plotting doesn’t work as well when it comes to character development. To call these characters paper-thin would be an understatement. The motivations of these characters are all but non-existent, and it becomes increasingly clear over the course of the film that the makers of Uncharted would much rather just lean into the movie star personas of Holland and Wahlberg than, you know, actually write some depth to these characters. It’s this shortcoming that makes it so difficult to become invested in any of the action that unfolds. The rest of the cast, with the notable exception of a sadly underutilized Antonio Banderas, can’t even lean into a well-established persona to make their characters the least bit interesting. Uncharted’s lack of personality extends into its action sequences. There are a few moments that briefly work as visually compelling action, but there are not too many. Too often Uncharted is content to just let movie stars stand in front of green screens and let the unimpressive CGI paired with some generic quips do all the work. It really highlights the limitations of adapting a video game into a movie because this interactive adventure series with nods to Indiana Jones just translates into an unengaging Indiana Jones knock-off. While Uncharted did nothing to impress me, there’s nothing about that I truly hated. It’s an entirely forgettable and inoffensive movie. You can’t blame Sony for trying to turn its vast library of video games into film franchises, but if this the plan going forward – after all, Uncharted is the first film produced under the Playstation Productions banner – they’re going to have to put in much more work to give these stories characters with depth and personalities, not merely personas. I can’t speak for how fans of the Uncharted series will feel about the movie as I’ve never played the games, but I can say that the feature film is wholly uninspired and will be gone from my memory in a matter of moments. An inoffensive, completely forgettable video game adaptation, Uncharted leans heavily on its CGI set pieces and movie star personas to gloss over an absurd plot and paper-thin characters. This here writing represents a symbol of Sean Mulvihill's individuality, and his belief in personal freedom. He's also a hack writer who drinks too much and falls in love with girls.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2022"," Tom Holland plays a youthful Nathan Drake, teaming up for the first time with Mark Wahlberg as his mentor Victor ‘Sully’ Sullivan in this lively Ruben Fleischer-directed take on the hugely-popular PlayStation adventure games. Fans of the games have expressed their displeasure – and how – at the casting of the youthful Holland and the moustacheless (most of the time) Wahlberg as their pixelated heroes, but Sony won’t be losing too much sleep as Holland’s currency is as high as it gets right now with his latest Spider-Man outing powering towards a global $2 billion box office haul. The chances of Uncharted achieving similar success are remote but this is a lively, likeable old-school treasure hunt romp likely to find favour with audiences looking for unsophisticated escapist fare or people who have never heard of Indiana Jones. Uncharted is actually anything but uncharted; it ploughs cinematic furrows we’ve travelled many times in the past, touching base not only with Harrison Ford’s famous fedora-sporting icon but also Nic Cage’s National Treasure series, Tomb Raider, and pretty much any other feature film where the heroes unfurl a musty rolled-up map. The film kicks off in fine style with a snippet from the sequence where Drake is thrown from a cargo plane and battles gun-wielding thugs and dodges tumbling crates – and even a car – as he somewhat implausibly defies the laws of gravity. We then flashback fifteen years and meet a young Nathan and his brother Sam who pledge to work together to uncover a cache of long-lost pirate treasure. The brothers are torn apart and in the modern-day, Nathan is working as a Tom Cruise-like cocktail barman who indulges in a little bit of pickpocketing on the side.  He meets up with Sully, who is looking for a sidekick to help him in his own treasure-hunting quest, and the two pair up and embark on a breakneck globe-trotting quest to locate an eye-watering fortune in legendary lost gold. But hot on their heels is ruthless fellow treasure hunter Moncada (Antonio Banderas), wily fortune hunter Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), vaguely placed as Nathan’s love interest, and Braddock (Tati Gabrielle),a mercenary in Moncada’s employ who has her own agenda. The stage is set for two hours of frantic rushing across the world (complete with an onscreen map chronicling their journey with red dots), lots of fights and stunts and implausible jeopardy and bags of double crossing (entirely appropriate as an early Macguffin that powers the plot is, quite literally, a double crucifix). Uncharted sidesteps any concerns about its almost utter lack of originality by throwing itself with gusto into its narrative at such a pace that you’re unlikely to even question the gaping plot chasms and utter illogicality of the whole thing. Holland and Wahlberg are charming company, uneasy adventurers swapping cheesy one-liners and getting themselves into ever more outrageous scrapes.  We revisit the opening sky-high fight scene that manages to take our breath away even though we’re well aware that it’s really just a triumph of green screen. Uncharted really comes alive in its last act and if you’re ever going to throw away your critical faculties and just allow yourself to wallow in the silliness of it all then it’s here, as our heroes and several no-good types descend upon a pair of hidden rotting galleons in readiness for the final high adrenalin confrontation. Uncharted is a big, warm-hearted derivative dose of high adventure nonsense and it almost defies its audience not to enjoy it despite its shortcomings, which, in end, only the most mean-minded are likely to really give too much of a damn about. Stick around for two sequel-baiting mid-credits sequences.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2022"," Oh, mon Dieu, as the great Hercule Poirot might say. Where to start, as Kenneth Branagh’s long-awaited, much-postponed, scandal-hit remake of Death On The Nile finally staggers into our cinemas? Well, let’s begin with the astonishing array of accents. There’s Branagh himself doing Belgian, which, as he’s once again playing Agatha Christie’s magnificently moustachioed Belgian detective, is fair enough. But then there’s American Annette Bening doing British but mainly shouting, London-born Sophie Okonedo doing Deep South American and being the best thing in it, and Scottish Rose Leslie playing a French maid. With Gal Gadot doing something unplaceable and the disgraced Armie Hammer (multiple allegations of sexual abuse, rape and even cannibalism surfaced after filming was completed) not really bothering at all, it comes as something of a relief that the inexplicably cast Russell Brand is not allowed to say anything. Throw in stop-start editing, exhaustingly restless camerawork and expensive visual effects trying ever so hard to recreate Egypt in the late 1930s and there’s no doubt Branagh’s second go at both directing and playing Poirot – his star-studded version of Murder On The Orient Express was released in 2017 – gets off to a problematic start. But, mes amis, just as you’re longing for Peter Ustinov and the hugely enjoyable 1978 film, it does get better, as wealthy heiress Linnet Ridgeway (Gadot) and her handsome new husband Simon (Hammer) depart on a honeymoon cruise down the Nile. They’re joined by a freeloading party of friends and relatives, the inevitable lawyer and doctor, and stalked by Simon’s understandably furious former fiancee, Jacqueline de Bellefort, played by the excellent Emma Mackey from TV’s Sex Education. I rather like Branagh’s slightly more red-blooded interpretation of Poirot (after David Suchet’s iconic performance, he had to do something different) and enjoyed the stylish black-and-white flashback that movingly explains the origins of the moustache. But despite an obvious improvement in the quality of the screenplay in the second half, this still feels like a Christie adaptation that never really makes it out of third gear. Marry Me is essentially Notting Hill in reverse, in that it begins with the world-famous singer Kat Valdez (Jennifer Lopez) marrying totally unknown single father and maths teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) as a face-saving publicity stunt when she belatedly discovers that her actual fiance and fellow pop star Bastian (played by the Colombian singer Maluma) has been unfaithful. Ah, as fellow devotees of romantic-comedy will have quickly worked out, what if – rather than having their fake nuptials instantly unwound with the help of a large cheque and a signed non-disclosure agreement – Kat and Charlie actually fell in love? On paper this shouldn’t really work. The premise is slight and predictable and Lopez, at 52, and Wilson, at 53, are surely a little too old to properly convince. On screen, however, it’s a rom-com treat, which is helped by some lovely set-pieces, a well-polished screenplay and the fact that Lopez – obviously playing a version of herself – has always been good at this sort of thing. Uncharted has been a popular video game for almost 15 years and is very much in the adventuring, historical treasure-hunting traditions of Tomb Raider and Lara Croft. But unless you’re a young active player or a former fan, it’s difficult to see how anyone else is going to get much out of a new and distinctly underwhelming film adaptation. Yes, Spider-Man star Tom Holland plays the central character of Nathan Drake and yes, director Ruben Fleischer has both Venom and Zombieland to his name, but the story, which sees Nathan reluctantly teaming up with rival treasure-hunter Victor Sullivan (played by Mark Wahlberg) to track down Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan’s long-lost gold, feels flat, linear and distinctly lacking in convincing jeopardy. The film has obvious echoes of both the Indiana Jones films and Pirates Of The Caribbean, while the supporting cast fail to rise to the occasion and Wahlberg is certainly no Harrison Ford. It’s good to see the likes of Riz Ahmed and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau putting some of their hard-earned film-star cash into Flee, a feature-length Danish animation that tells the extraordinary story of one particular Afghan refugee.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 14, 2022"," Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code are clear influences but really this is just a string of breathless action sequences for Spider-Man actor Tom Holland. The Brit plays thinly sketched Nathan Drake who, after growing up in an orphanage with his now-missing brother Sam, embarked on an unlikely career as free-running pickpocket/cocktail mixologist. After a perfunctory flashback to his childhood, we see Nathan impress Mark Wahlberg’s mysterious punter Victor “Sully” Sullivan by stealing the bracelet of a young woman who visits the bar.  Sully, some sort of explorer, invites him on a globe-trotting mission to find his brother and track down the treasure of 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 13, 2022"," Very little about Jonas Poher Rasmussen’s Oscar-nominated documentary Flee is what it seems. The film tells the story of a gay Afghan man named Amin Nawabi who in the 1980s fled Afghanistan for Russia before finally finding sanctuary in Denmark, but Amin is not his real name. Nor does he appear before the cameras, because he did not want to be filmed, so instead his story is animated much like Persepolis: clean, unfussy strokes and washes of colour that turn his story into a heartbreaking odyssey.",POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2022"," Back in 2011, in a commercial made for the Japanese market but which has since appeared online, Harrison Ford sat down in front of a TV to play the third video game in the Uncharted series. “Fantastic. Oh, incredible,” said the star, as he hammered the X button with his thumb. “So cinematic.” It was a publicity coup — the actual Indiana Jones stepping into the pixelly shoes of his gaming equivalent, Nathan Drake. It was yet more evidence that Uncharted — a brilliantly executed PlayStation adventure franchise which is, yes, cinematic as hell — was destined to become a film series too. But the ad also hinted strongly at the biggest problem facing anyone daring to take Drake to the big screen: the shadow of Spielberg’s Indy films, the gold standard for movies about treasure-hunters dodging dusty booby-traps and falling out of planes. After roughly 15 years of development, Uncharted the movie is finally here. Dusty booby-traps and plummets from planes are present and correct. Alas, despite the promise and all that time expended, it’s disappointingly weak sauce. For die-hard fans of the games, there’s little that lives up to their ingeniously unfolding action set-pieces, such as the train sequence in Uncharted 2 which builds and builds in intensity until a cliffhanger that involves actual cliff-hanging, or the wild horseback gun-battle in part 3. Non-Drakeheads, meanwhile, are likely to wonder what all the fuss was about. What’s on screen is amiable enough, a hunt for $4 billion of pirate booty that involves a lot of double-crossing (plus, thanks to the film’s twin MacGuffin, a pair of crucifixes, a literal double-cross). But while it clearly aims for Raiders Of The Lost Ark — “When did you decide to become Indiana Jones?” someone says at one point, while our heroes’ trek is depicted by a red dotted line on a map, Indy-style — it lands somewhere around National Treasure 2 instead. Over the years, the search to fill the two lead roles — Drake and his grizzled mentor Sully — cycled through pretty much every actor in Hollywood with a gym membership card. It finally landed on Tom Holland and Mark Wahlberg, two actors who can be charming and funny individually, but who struggle to muster up much in the way of comic chemistry here. It doesn’t help that the dialogue they’re given is significantly lamer than that uttered by their video-game counterparts; as they bicker in catacombs over ancient riddles (Wahlberg was at least well-cast in the sense that his resting expression suggests he is perpetually trying to crack an ancient riddle), scenes start to feel like cutscenes that you wish you could skip. Antonio Banderas, likewise, makes for a colourless villain, with monologues about “diversified investments” so inert that even his goons look bored. There are moments when it jolts into life: a well-executed, lengthy single shot tracking Drake as he freefalls from an aircraft; some Goonies-esque underground map-syncing. But only the final 20 minutes, with a pirate-ship battle that takes to the skies, lives up to the giddy, inventive spectacle of the source material. Otherwise, Uncharted plods around an all-too-familiar map.",NEUTRAL

"Feb 12, 2022"," Street-smart Nathan Drake is recruited by seasoned treasure hunter Victor “Sully” Sullivan to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada. It’s easy to take a look at Naughty Dog’s phenomenally successful Uncharted video game franchise and consider it among the IP ripest for a movie adaptation. After all, the games are focused squarely around a charmingly roguish protagonist being forced through one vertiginous set-piece after another, in a style so fluidly cinematic that it could be translated near-verbatim to live-action. Yet when you get into what Uncharted really is, it’s clear that bringing the globe-trotting action-adventure series to the big screen is a little trickier than it first seems, as director Ruben Flesicher (Venom) and the film’s trio of screenwriters ultimately fail to reconcile. It’s no secret that the Uncharted games owe a massive debt to the Indiana Jones movies, and while that creates a compelling hook for a video game in which the player is an active participant in the running, shooting, jumping, climbing, and puzzle-solving, as a movie it ends up feeling like, well, a dull facsimile of Indiana Jones. This isn’t to say that the film couldn’t have been a fun time; with worthy casting of intrepid treasure hunter Nathan Drake and his cantankerous older mentor Sully, and a script that exploited their well-honed chemistry from the games, Uncharted had a better chance than most video game movies of actually succeeding, and even becoming a viable blockbuster IP in its own right. But top to bottom this is patronisingly low-effort hokum that lacks both the gut-wrenching suspense and organic good humour of its immediate source material. The problem first and foremost is that neither Tom Holland nor Mark Wahlberg are particularly well-suited to their parts. Fans have long decried Holland being considerably younger than the Nate from the games, and it’s difficult not to view that casting decision through the cynical lens of a Hollywood studio. Numerous age-appropriate actors have been touted for the part over the years – Nathan Fillion was a long-time fan favourite, and Wahlberg himself was up for it when David O. Russell was attached to direct years ago – but one can easily picture the Sony execs picking Holland on the pure basis of his success playing Spider-Man. But of course Peter Parker and Nathan Drake are very different characters, even ignoring their ages, and yet Holland’s Nate feels more-or-less a sublimation of his Peter Parker. The swagger and confidence of the video game Nate is mostly absent here, and while you can argue that this is supposed to be a younger, less-assured Nate, is that really what anyone who loves the video games was interested in seeing? Wahlberg is similarly much younger than the Sully of the games, and true to form gives a playing-himself performance that offers sporadic amusement but more often feels uninterestedly phoned-in. The biggest calamity of all, though, is that Holland and Wahlberg’s chemistry lacks the crucial spark around which this entire enterprise is hinged. Not even a bevy of well-executed set-pieces could buoy the film if this part was lacking, which it is. The “funny” quips and banter feel horribly forced throughout, albeit in large part due to the almost parodically formulaic script. There’s keener promise among the wider supporting cast but the talented players are largely squandered; Antonio Banderas sleepwalks his way through a nothing role as overarching antagonist Santiago Moncada, a scowling treasure hunter with some all-timer daddy issues. As his lieutenant, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) is far more appealing, though beyond her neat look and a few crunchy action beats, she’s a cardboard standee of a character. To get back to the video game characters, though, there’s one who’s actually somewhat well-served here, and that’s Nate and Drake’s regular frenemy Chloe Frazer, brought to vibrant life with a spunky turn from Sophia Ali. Ali both physically resembles Chloe from the games and, more importantly, captures the essence of her personality, enough to make you lament the fact that she’s stuck in a movie with actors playing crude maquette imitations of their video game namesakes. But the cast is unaided throughout by an embarrassingly lousy screenplay which semi-randomly borrows cues, plot points, and action sequences from the video games yet without any of their ingenuity or craftsmanship. Nate and Sully’s treasure hunt is thunderously boring for long stretches, exacerbated by their slack chemistry and the fact that watching people solve puzzles in dimly-lit ruinous environments isn’t nearly as interesting to watch as it is to play in a game. The real disappointment for many will be that Uncharted doesn’t even really function as a passable action film; the majority of the generic set-pieces on offer are over in a flash and feel weirdly constrained, while director Fleischer – less an artist than a hired gun of a filmmaker – has little knack for approximating the games’ splashy style. He gets close with two back-to-back sequences in the final third – an adaptation of Uncharted 3′s cargo plane sequence and a finale involving flying pirate ships – but even then, there’s nothing here that can hold a candle to the creativity of the games’ action. From its ill-suited cast to its scrawled-on-a-napkin script, mediocre action, and generally thrown-together feel – including a distracting overabundance of ADR dialogue piped in to add “pep” to action beats – Uncharted is a fascinatingly underwhelming misfire that can’t even satisfy as a basically disposable adventure romp. Whether this marks the launch of a major video game movie franchise will depend on its commercial performance, and though loyal fans will surely flock to it reviews be-damned, something this shamelessly vanilla and snoozy really doesn’t deserve to succeed where so many other adaptations have failed. Uncharted again proves that video games inspired by classic movies – in this case Indiana Jones – should probably stay video games, because this soulless action-adventure flick feels like a dusty double-photocopy of Harrison Ford’s blockbuster franchise.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 12, 2022"," ‘No, no, no no, no!’ ‘is one of the trademark phrases of adventurer Nathan Drake in the popular Naughty Dog video game, usually as he struggles to gain purchase on a crumbling temple ledge; if you haven’t played the four astonishingly cinematic Uncharted games, you’ve missed out on one of life’s hidden treasures. Drake is a thief and an adventurer, and his life is a non-stop story of discovery, betrayal and friendship; climbing up a train as it dangles over a precipice, solving centuries old puzzles in mythical kingdoms, navigating ancient buildings at they collapse and firing RPG’s at marauding enemies from horseback. But after a number of wrong turns, and despite the efforts of top talent in front of and behind the camera, one of the best video games of all time makes for a rather ordinary movie. So non-gamers can start here, since you don’t need a VR helmet to enjoy this lush, expensive venture from Playstation; Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) is a bartender AND a thief in New York, and he’s approached by suave action-man Sully (Mark Wahlberg) to track down some legendary gold. Hoping to find some clues as to the whereabouts of his long-missing brother, Drake agrees, launching the upstart and his snarky mentor onto a cross-globe trip that takes them up against the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his gang of hardball mercenaries. Part of the problem here is that Uncharted the game featured a world derived from films, then developed into something rather more extravagant; the formula is hard to reverse engineer back to traditional movie tropes. The characters of Drake and pal Victor ‘Sully’ Sullivan were fairly boilerplate creations, and their adventures were initially generic; as the games developed, so did the characters and the sophistication of the story. Aside from a brief opening flashback, Ruben Fleischer’s film barely features any of the game’s well-developed lore, looking more like a bland sub-Red Notice action film, and only the last half hour creates the kind of imaginative diorama of ‘Indiana Jones on steroids’ run-and gun-action that the games conjured up with such good humour. There’s a brief shot of Sully doggedly climbing up the mast of a galleon being held in mid-air by a helicopter that’s exactly the right grandiose vibe; it just takes this film a long time to get there. The casting isn’t great either; Holland is too young for Drake, constantly on the brink or retiring in the game, and Wahlberg doesn’t have Sully’s grizzled cigar-chomping style; Nathan Fillion and Nick Offerman could have filled these roles with much more character. The takeaway is that Uncharted isn’t a game-changer like the IP that it’s based on, but it is a competent blockbuster that will probably work best for those who have never heard of Drake. Holland and Wahlberg are personable stars, and the big action highlights are certainly grand in scope; the best of these lift knockout moments directly from the game like getting caught in the billowing nets of a cargo plane mid-flight. With less humour or gunplay, but more bickering and tedious plotting than might have been expected, the final sequences of Uncharted eventually tap into the enterprising mojo that powers the much-loved franchise, but it’s too little and too late for the millions who will prefer to play the game. I’ll see this at some point when it turns up on Amazon or the like. I have never heard of the game so won’t be disappointed in that aspect at least. The game is phenomenonal, like being Indiana Jones in an Indiana Jones movie. A better movie than most movies. Don’t your library have games, or just dinosaur toys? Three cheese mac is possible, a bit of stringiness is acceptable, maybe pulverise some potato crisps and sprinkle them on top, then put in a pyrex dish in the over at 180 degrees for about twenty minutes. Then  grill the top a little, and serve up for a hearty evening meal. Especially nice is the Jamie Oliver recipe for cauliflower & broccoli cheese with crispy breadcrumb topping and 3 cheeses. I know he’s a knob but that’s the yummiest recipe for cauliflower cheese I’ve done so far. We must have been watching different films. I knew nothing of the source video game so came at this fresh. Looks to me like a new franchise. Thought Holland was just right and they were a great pairing. Clues, crosses, double-crosses, great female action characters, non-stop story, and the grand finale of ancient ships bursting our of the water in an amazing aerial duel. The airborne stuff was like the game. It’s like being Indiana Jones, just a cinematic game to play, the film really doesn’t do it justice. Hope they get it right next time. No idea it was a game. So hope there are gazillion like me who don’t care whether the adaptation was good or bad and just want to see an enjoyable picture without bringing pre-judgements to the table. Incidentally, one of the bits in the trailer came from the end-credits section pushing the sequel. Completely agree that Holland is too young for this role; I would have much preferred Fillion. I get that he’s 50, but that hasn’t stopped older action stars. I’m getting that people who dodn’t know the game find this an engaging action flick, but it feels like a step down if you love the game; Nathan Drake is about one more gig, rather than a fresh-faced newbie. I guess people dig Holland right now, and that’s what gets the film made.. This demo site is only for demonstration purposes. All images are copyrighted to their respective owners.

"Feb 11, 2022"," Synopsis: When approached by swindling treasure hunter Victor Sullivan with the key to finding the lost treasure once sought by his estranged brother, aspiring thief Nathan Drake embarks on a globe-trotting adventure following the footsteps of Magellan whilst being hunted by a ruthless magnate who believes the treasure is his by birthright. The Uncharted series sits in a bit of a weird position when it comes to video game-to-film adaptation, as it is both so story-driven and cinematic that it makes for a smooth transition, and yet too cinematic that all a movie version could end up being equivalent to just watching someone else play the game. Regardless, an Uncharted movie has been in some form of development for over a decade, seemingly as cursed as some of the artifacts intrepid adventurer Nathan Drake has sought over the years. Heck, it’s been in the pipeline so long, Mark Wahlberg was originally attached to play Drake back in 2010, and that was just the first iteration of a project that’s been through multiple directors and writers since. Finally unleashed to theatres as the first of a planned slate of adaptations from PlayStation Productions (they’ve even got a fancy Marvel Studios-esque logo and everything), can Uncharted take advantage of everything great about the games without falling the usual video game movie traps? In short: yes, but not without major caveats. The pacing is incredibly tight as the plot moves briskly whilst still finding moments for the characters to breathe, and it absolutely makes sure to cram in as many elements from the games as it possibly can. Overly complex puzzles and scavenger hunts that require constant checking of journals? Check. Pseudo-intellectual exposition dumps? Check. Both heroes and villains constantly double-crossing each other? Check. Action sequences that tempt the laws of physics and feature so much casual killing that it makes you question Drake’s morality? Double check. Seriously, the only things they’ve left off the checklist are some dark twist about the hidden treasure and watching Drake die constantly as he (or, more accurately, the player) misidentifies what is a climbable ledge. If that’s all you want from an Uncharted movie, you’re probably going to be satisfied, but without that sense of player connection that made the games more than just interactive movies, it’s not an experience you’ll remember for long. There was some doubt when it was announced Tom Holland would don the iconic half-tucked Henley of Nathan Drake, especially from those who were still dead set on casting Nathan Fillion (guys, the man is 50 and he already did that fan film, so please just leave it be). Thankfully, Holland ends up being the glue that holds the movie together when the action can’t. Playing a younger Drake just starting his career as a plunderer of lost treasure, he’s given a certain amount of leeway to not be an exact imitation of Nolan North (who gets a nice tip-of-the-hat cameo), but from his cocky quips in the face of danger to his penchant for knowing the exact historical trivia to solve a puzzle, he’s recognisably Nathan Drake regardless. It’s a role Holland certainly has room to grow into, and in future installments, they’ll hopefully incorporate more of Drake’s obsessive and thrill-seeking tendencies. On a similar note, Sophia Ali captures the essence of series mainstay Chloe Frazer to a T, from her teasing sarcasm to her inability to trust anyone (or be trustworthy herself…). In the villain’s seat is Antonio Banderas as the brutal Moncada, and whilst he’s certainly an intimidating adversary at first, he’s barely in the movie. Most of the actual antagonising comes from his lieutenant Braddock (who I’d bet hard cash was Nadine Ross from A Thief’s End and The Lost Legacy in early drafts), who lacks any of the history and connection to the treasure that Drake and Moncada have, nor has much of a personality beyond being tough.  The film’s most frustrating casting, though, comes from Mark Wahlberg as Drake’s mentor Victor Sullivan. Though he has a solid report with Holland and by tale’s end starts to take on the iconographic traits of his digital counterpart, he completely lacks that “cool uncle” wit and charm that makes Sully such a memorable presence in the games. Wahlberg might as well be playing any number of his interchangeable action heroes from over the years, and most of his attempts at being charming come off as smarmy rather than endearing. At the same time though, it’s his character arc of slowly becoming more trusting of Drake that serves as the emotional backbone of the story. Despite a throughline of following the trail of his missing brother Sam, Nathan’s progression is mostly relegated to becoming a better treasure hunter and helping Sully be a better person rather than any personal fulfillment. Wahlberg is not an untalented actor and playing a lovable scoundrel like Sully is in his wheelhouse, but neither he nor the filmmakers have made the effort to bring that character to life beyond a brief promise they may eventually. The developers at Naughty Dog have prior said that they usually come up with the set pieces of each Uncharted adventure first and then construct the plot around them, and it often feels like a similar approach has been taken to the action in its celluloid counterpart. The film opens with a bang in typical Nathan Drake fashion with a flash-forward to later in the story as our hero is in the midst of some death-defying situation; in this case, a faithful recreation of the famous crates-hanging-out-of-an-airplane sequence from Drake’s Deception. It sets expectations quite high for thrills to come, but it takes a long time for anything comparable to that tease to arrive. Other than a brief display of acrobatics during an auction house robbery inspired by A Thief’s End, Drake and Sully spend most of the film in basic foot chases and henchman brawls you could find in any action blockbuster. Some are a little more imaginative, such as when Drake has to fend off Moncada’s thugs in a crypt-turned-nightclub whilst Chloe frantically solves a puzzle, but compared to the average life-or-death situation you’d find in the games they pale in comparison. Thankfully, the finale does a lot to make up for it by creating a set piece wholly original to the film and yet would make for an epic level of the games. If the film had at least one more action beat that impressive nestled somewhere in the first two acts, it would be easier to forgive its more pedestrian moments. As a technical package, Uncharted looks about as slick as any typical Hollywood blockbuster but that also means it has many of the same faults, most evident in its overuse of CGI. Whilst both the plane sequence and the final battle are a blast, it’s blatantly obvious how much of it is being done on a soundstage with digital doubles stitching together the more ludicrous stunts. Perhaps the borderline-insane antics of the recent Mission: Impossible have spoiled us, but it’s hard to settle for Tom Holland jumping on boxes in front of a green screen when you know Tom Cruise has done more dangerous stunts practically. Much of the rest of film’s aesthetics have a similar expensive-but-expected approach, with Chung-hoon Chung’s cinematography capturing the exaggerated cinematic look of the games but with much of the grit and playfulness softened at the edges. It all feels too focus-tested and corporate, which isn’t made more obvious than in a scene where Sully conveniently finds a keyhole to solve a puzzle inside a Papa John’s; easily the most egregious use of product placement since Krispy Kreme in 2017’s Power Rangers. This is all topped off by Ramin Djawadi’s score the, whilst the way it slowly incorporates the familiar Uncharted theme as Drake grows as a character is a nice touch, otherwise lacks the adventurous John Williams-like feel of the game’s music and opts for a more rock-infused soundscape comparable to Djawadi’s work on Iron Man and Eternals. No disrespect to the composer, I love most of his other work, but I’d certainly love to see a rescored version using Greg Edmonson and Henry Jackman’s compositions from the games. Uncharted is at least spiritually faithful to the games and makes for a decent bit of matinee fun in the vein of National Treasure or 1999’s The Mummy, but without the controller in your hand, it lacks the magic ingredient that makes it so special. It’s a triumph when compared to most video games movies, but stacked against the best of them (none of which would garner above a 7/10 from me) and it’s probably not even in the top five. Whether the potential sequel decides to more closely follow the games or go off on their own tangent, what it really needs to prioritise is to find its own niche in the genre beyond OTT action and self-deprecating repartee. I think that’s the real hurdle that has hit almost every video game adaptation: satisfyingly replacing what’s lost by removing player agency. Resident Evil isn’t as scary when you aren’t the one opening that creepy door, Mortal Kombat isn’t as brutal when you aren’t the one pulling off that fatality, and Uncharted isn’t as thrilling when your quick thinking isn’t what gets Nathan Drake out of a jam. Whenever they figure out how to compensate for that loss, that’s going to be when video game movies can go beyond being tribute acts and become great films in their own right.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," Just as she is about to get hitched again, Kat sees news reports that the “love of her life” has been unfaithful and calls off the nuptials. That “regular guy” is divorced, single dad teacher Charlie Gilbert, played by Owen Wilson. He is considerably less convincing in his role — none of my teachers ever looked or acted like him. Kat’s likeable manager, played by Game Of Thrones actor John Bradley, says it’s “nuts”. This is a classic fish-out-of-water tale where Charlie raises the laughs by not knowing any of the showbiz rules. Wilson and Lopez deserve credit for developing just enough on-screen chemistry to make the romance work. The actress, though, surely can’t imagine that such a cheesy movie will win her many plaudits. It contains all the rom-com cliches, including the post-break-up sequence of Charlie trudging alone through the city with his best pal telling him some home truths. If you want a Valentine’s weekend film with an airport dash — including a “there are no seats left on this flight” moment — you may as well say I Do to Marry Me. This has included multiple allegations of sexual abuse against leading man, Armie Hammer – something he denies – and its leading woman, Gal Gadot, facing a backlash for comments on the Israel-Palestine conflict. In 1937 London, the detective is watching couple Simon Doyle (Hammer) and Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey) dancing in a jazz club. Then Jacqueline’s best friend, multi-millionaire Linnet Ridgeway (Gadot) arrives. Within weeks Linnet and Simon are hitched and on a honeymoon cruise on the Nile, joined by friends including new pal Poirot. But jealous Jacqueline is following them. PIECE the ancient clues together to find the treasure before the bad guys is the not especially original premise for fortune hunters Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) and Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg). But hot on their heels in the race to find the hidden booty are villains Monncada (Antonio Banderas) and his snarling sidekick Braddock (Tati Gabrielle). Based on the best-selling PlayStation game, the film remains a rudimental complete the levels”, and not much more is asked of anyone. Holland – fresh from his Spider-Man exploits –  is funny and charismatic as Nate, Banderas snarls on command and Wahlberg’s Sully doesn’t have much to do except yell frantically through drains and call Nate “Kid” a lot.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," Based on the much loved video game franchise of the same name, Uncharted is a diet version of Indiana Jones that coasts by on the charisma of its star, Spider-Man’s Tom Holland, and some fun action sequences. Holland plays protagonist Nathan Drake, here a street-smart orphan with an in-depth knowledge of history (and buried treasure) who is also a dab hand at petty thievery. Wanting to find explorer Magellan’s lost fortune to honour his long-missing brother, Nathan teams up with seasoned (meaning: humourless) treasure hunter/thief Sully (Wahlberg) to find it. Sully isn’t to be trusted, of course, and there are other people interested in the hoard, too, including lethal Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), rival Chloe (Ali) and financier-with-daddy-issues Moncada (Banderas). Their adventures take them scurrying along the rooftops and under the streets of Barcelona, and across the globe in search of Magellan’s missing gold-laden ships. Fans of the games probably won’t be impressed (there is a nice little cameo to watch out for at least) as the movie doesn’t have enough jaw-dropping sequences to rival its computer game inspiration, while anyone who has seen the Indiana Jones movies (which are knowingly referenced) will wish the film had even half of that franchise’s wit. There are other problems, too – Banderas is surprisingly muted, Tati Gabrielle and Sophia Ali’s characters are underwritten and Wahlberg just looks like he’d rather be somewhere else (is he upset he wasn’t cast as Nathan Drake, maybe?) That being said, there are some terrific moments as well, such as the opening falling-from-a-plane sequence, the Barcelona chase and treasure hunt, and a bonkers and logic-free finale that involves historic ships being dangled from helicopters. Plus, Holland is extremely watchable as the adventurous Drake, and while this never reaches the heights of an Indiana Jones movie (though it is better than Crystal Skull) or The Goonies, it is nonetheless a fun adventure movie that should entertain kids and anyone who looking for an easy to digest slice of big screen adventure. There are action sequences involving fights, guns and swords that may be too much for the under-10s, and characters are threatened, often in danger and at one point almost drown.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," The Uncharted Playstation games following the adventures of a swashbuckling treasure hunter have always been hailed for their cinematic appeal. It was only a matter of time, then, before talk of a film adaptation became real. Nathan Drake has a lot to live up to following the likes of Indiana Jones, The Mummy and even the less well-received but fun National Treasure and Lara Croft movies. Nevertheless, there’s certainly a gap in the movie market for a fresh take on such globe-trotting quests for ancient gold and historical artefacts that probably belong in a museum. Surely, the only real hump to get over was the curse of the video game adaptation, but with the right leading man the blockbuster visuals of the Uncharted series could carry it through right? Possibly, but if only they’d cast the right guy to play Nathan Drake. Don’t get me wrong, Tom Holland is an appealing movie star who can carry a franchise; proven by his action prowess and charm even just a few weeks ago in Spider-Man: No Way Home. However, he’s just not the right fit for the Playstation action hero, who was based on a cross between Jackass stunt legend Johnny Knoxville and Harrison Ford himself. This should be a Chris Pratt or a Bradley Cooper, a beefer and older hunk who’s at least in his early-to-mid thirties. Yet when Tom Holland pitched a young James Bond movie to Sony, the studio thought their bankable star could lead a new franchise in an Uncharted prequel of sorts. No doubt assuming the Spider-Man actor could be playing the role for years to come. The problem is, however, that Holland really is just miscast and can’t quite decide if he’s still playing the awkward geeky Peter Parker or the confident and assertive Drake. Like the games, the Uncharted movie sees him team up with Victor “Sully” Sullivan, played by Mark Wahlberg as they follow clues to find a great treasure. The banter between the young swashbuckler and his con artist mentor provides plenty of wisecracks, although the lacklustre script saw only the mildest of titters land from the audience. At times the dialogue is painfully cheesy too, with one scene having Nate pretending to be a pirate at the wheel of a ship as Sully shouts something along the lines of “Alright there, Jack Sparrow?” The blockbuster is perfectly watchable and reasonably entertaining with some incredible action from Holland and fun puzzles deep in ancient chambers along the way. Although the CGI is a bit ropey at times. It’s easy to dismiss, but if the box office isn’t too low to not warrant a sequel, here’s hoping they give it another go as treasure hunting movies can be and should be really enjoyable. But next time, give it to a James Gunn or another writer-director with more of a comic edge and clear vision to deliver something incredibly entertaining.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," Those trying to keep the multiplexes alive must view Tom Holland, aka Spider-Man, as a god. There are surely projector-room shrines across the globe, in which candles flicker beneath posters of Holland’s ruefully perky little face. Is his new Sony blockbuster as glorious as No Way Home? No way. But in that it’s bound to put many bums on seats, it will answer a lot of prayers. Uncharted is based on the super-successful PlayStation series. Movies inspired by video games have a terrible track record, though Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog (accessible to outsiders, adored by fans) have partly broken the curse. Uncharted’s director, Ruben Fleischer, ensures there are no obstacles for the uninitiated  - you don’t need to be a gamer to love Uncharted. You just need to have a very soft spot for buddy movies, maps, puzzles, pirate ships and Holland’s chest. That’s right. The chest of gold, here, is the 25 year old actor’s torso. I was expecting off-the-chart silliness. I wasn’t expecting Tomb Raider-with-pecs. But more of that later. Holland plays Nathan Drake, a jaunty, sticky-fingered barman living in New York, who longs to be reunited with his treasure-hunting brother, Sam. Nathan gets involved with a grizzled scavenger, Victor ‘Sully’ Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg), and Sully’s bad-ass, Australian-Indian frenemy, Chloe (Sophia Ali). Apparently two ornate crosses and a church in Barcelona hold the key to finding $5 billion worth of buried gold. Will Sam be at the end of this rainbow? Either way, entitled tycoon, Moncada (Antonio Banderas), and his side kick, Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), aim to get their hands on the loot first.  Holland, even when delivering lines like, “We’re in some kind of ruined antechamber!” is adorable. He’s sparky with Gabrielle (Nathan and the sexily vicious Braddock lock eyes early on, and even the way our hero then tries to steer clear of her is cute) and with Ali - dancing together in a packed nightclub, they’re such a good fit. He and Banderas have a great connection, and, of course, Holland and Wahlberg (in my humble opinion, a comic genius) make the best of the banter. Still, the way the leading man is fetishised by the camera is surreal. It’s like someone behind it is shouting, “Tom, take your shirt off!”; “Tom, it’s time to get wet!” Thanks to a variety of oceans/lagoons/malfunctioning fountains, Nathan gets wet a lot. Which means his shirts cling. Despite being coy on the subject of sex (Chloe and Nathan share a bed but aren’t seen doing anything in it) Uncharted is destined to be both a gay classic and a hen night favourite. It’s also guaranteed to boost gym membership.  Might this experience, though, be what prompted Holland to consider taking a break from acting? After the shoot, he aired doubts about the quality of his performance, wondering if he’d put too much energy into trying to “look good”. But it’s the film, not him, whose priorities are askew. Just to be clear. Though elements of the plot grate (what fuels Braddock’s fury is that she was dumped by Sully; ah, of course, she’s a woman scorned) Uncharted is not hateful. And though Chloe is much more interesting in the PlayStation game, Ali is a talented actor and puts a nice spin on even the most robotic lines. And yet. The same goes for Holland. He’s too good for this would-be franchise. It’s hard to talk away from this kind of money, but it’s time for him to skedaddle.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," Abandon hope all ye who enter here. There truly is no future for the video-game-to-movie adaptation if Hollywood can’t even crack Uncharted. The treasure-hunting franchise – consisting of four games and several spin-offs – is regularly dragged out as an example of the medium’s cinematic potential. Like Tomb Raider before it (and Indiana Jones before that), Uncharted borrows heavily from the adventure serials of the Thirties, digging deep into the romantic traditions of discovery and exoticised wanderlust. The Uncharted games all adhere to the same basic, reliable structure: treasure hunter Nathan Drake, at the behest of some ancient map or cryptic piece of archaeology, solves a few puzzles and crash-lands into far-flung locations. He’ll hitch a ride on a freight train, a helicopter, or a speedboat, and dodge bullets shot by faceless goons. These are rigorously traditional stories. That always seemed to be the point. Uncharted’s rich set of characters and finely tuned gameplay – which slips in and out of cut scenes with a balletic elegance – allowed players to feel like they were in the driver’s seat of their favourite childhood adventure. So why, then, does the Uncharted film feel so passionless and inert? While it’s not detached from its source material, it’s hardly enamoured by it either. Video games might be becoming more and more like movies (2019’s Death Stranding features a 31-minute cut scene), but the movies have yet to figure out that people do, indeed, like and play video games. Say what you like about Detective Pikachu, but at least it knew what Pokémon were. Uncharted has the distinct whiff of a studio cottoning on to the financial success of the series, without ever bothering to ask the questions of “how” and “why”. This is how we ended up with Tom Holland playing Nathan Drake, a character so well-known for looking like Castle star Nathan Fillion that the actor was hired to play him in a 2018 fan film. The giveaway that Sony Pictures hasn’t invested all that much thought into the character is the fact that Mark Wahlberg, previously attached to play Drake back in 2010, has now jumped into the role of Drake’s mentor and father figure, Victor “Sully” Sullivan, without the slightest hesitation. The film’s plot is a hodgepodge of sequences from the games. We open where Uncharted 4 began, with a flashback of Nate and his rebellious older brother Sam, who has since all but disappeared minus the occasional postcard. Now working as a bartender and petty thief, Nate is enlisted by Sully to uncover the hidden treasure of Magellan – though they’ll have to beat Antonio Banderas’s Santiago to it. He’s part of the shady Moncada family, who funded the Inquisition, the Franco regime, and any other part of Spanish history you could pluck out of a textbook. Holland, as a matter of distinction, is meant to be playing the younger, less experienced iteration of Drake. And, certainly, he’d be a great fit for an aged-down version of some other adventurer – in an action landscape largely populated by human bricks, it’s quite refreshing to see a former Billy Elliot slip, slide and bounce off walls with such nimble grace. But the film has a poor grasp on what a “Tom Holland as Nathan Drake” character should look like. It feels as if he’s retreated back into his “gee-whiz”, Spider-Man shtick. Wahlberg, too, is an odd fit. He’s mostly on eyebrow-cocked autopilot in Uncharted – which has worked in the past, but functions on an entirely different energy level to the ever-sincere Holland. The actors are left to force some rapport out of a script that has no idea what either of these characters mean to each other. Sully is a conflicted man, though that’s oddly represented by an early reveal that he was part of the looting of Baghdad’s national museum – thus, he’s committed an actual war crime. He’s also a technologically clueless boomer who Drake mocks for having “so many apps open”. Who’s meant to be the mentor figure here when they both come across as incompetent? There’s a lot, in fact, to Uncharted that feels haphazard or under-considered. The only roles for women – Sophia Ali’s Chloe Frazer, who is from the games, and Tati Gabrielle’s Braddock, who is not – are both written as slight variations on “cool, emotionless action girl”. The film’s finale also eschews the effective, foreboding message of the games (borrowed from Raiders of the Lost Ark and its face-melting spirits) that history is to be respected, not exploited for our own gain. For fans of the source material, it may be disappointing to see such a rich series reduced to several heavily CGI-ed sequences of people clinging to things mid-air (and the lack of decent puzzles! What is an adventure film without puzzles!). For those new to Uncharted, they’ll just be left to wonder what all the fuss is about.",NEUTRAL

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. After being stuck in development for more than a decade, long-awaited videogame adap Uncharted finally hits the big screen. Director Ruben Fleischer (Venom, the Zombieland movies) delivers a fun, globe-trotting quest, one that unashamedly draws inspiration from a name-checked Indiana Jones while never quite managing to capture the same spirit of his adventures.  Serving as a prequel to the games, it sees Tom Holland step into the formerly pixelated shoes of Nathan Drake, here a skillful bartender, history nerd, and occasional pickpocket, who is recruited by his estranged brother’s partner Sully (Mark Wahlberg) to search for the lost treasure of Magellan. Action-packed antics ensue, filled with enough old clues and secret passages to make Dan Brown’s Robert Langford blush. Throughout, the film revels in the adventure-movie genre, proudly wearing its cliches on its rolled-up safari shirt sleeves. However, Fleischer isn’t able to muster the right sense of momentum for what should feel like a thrilling race-against-time pursuit. Holland, at least, really proves his leading-man credentials outside of the MCU, bringing fresh-faced energy and physicality to a role that puts the ‘buff’ in ‘history buff’ (one montage sees him researching 16th-century artifacts between shirtless chin-ups). Drake is quick on his feet in both senses, thinking fast during fight scenes in a way that allows Holland to flex his own acrobatic talents with flashes of parkour.  Meanwhile, Wahlberg’s untrusting and untrustworthy Sully adds sass and sarcasm to what is clearly supposed to be an entertaining buddy-cop-style dynamic. Sadly, Holland and Wahlberg fall short of the chemistry required to really spark on screen. Their relationship evolves, but they never feel more than just treasure-hunting ‘colleagues’. With trust among thieves a key theme, Sully’s betrayed associate Chloe (Sophia Ali) completes a triangle of suspicion among the adventurers. But, overall, the game of alliances and betrayal that plays out just makes it more difficult to invest in anyone’s real motives.  There’s much to suggest that the film is intended as the start of a new franchise. And with plenty of potential and a door swung wide open for a future sequel, Uncharted makes a decent play for filling an Indy-shaped hole in the movie market right now. But the series will need to beef up its reserves of charm and swagger to be in the same league as cinema’s favorite archaeologist. Uncharted is in UK cinemas now and US theaters from February 18.

"Feb 11, 2022"," If some pitiless sadist fed a copy of The Da Vinci Code through the Hollywood Marveliser, Uncharted could easily be the result. Spun off from a popular series of PlayStation games, it’s a plastic archeological swashbuckler which goes through the genre’s motions with all the elegance and verve of a glazed-over gamer Pavlovically prodding the buttons on his joypad.  Fresh-ish from Spider Man: No Way Home (though in fact Uncharted was shot first, during the first year of the pandemic), Tom Holland stars as Nathan ‘Nate’ Drake, a direct descendent of Sir Francis – or so his parents told him, before whatever tragic event left him and his elder brother Sam in an orphanage, from where the two steal out under cover of darkness to relieve a local museum of its antiquities.  Fast forward into Nate’s early adulthood and Sam’s gone AWOL, while our still fairly young hero is mixing drinks in a chic New York bar while picking the pockets of its bourgeois clients.  Enter, with a clunk, Mark Wahlberg, jarringly miscast as debonair treasure hunter Victor Sullivan, who enlists Nate in his search for a legendary cache of gold hidden somewhere or other by the crew of the Magellan expedition, and never seen again for 500 years.  As a blue-collar stoic or preening meathead Wahlberg can be terrifically good value, but he proves about as natural a fit for a suave surrogate father figure as would a ballgown for an orangutan, and the very thought of him leading young Nate into a cutthroat netherworld of ruthless artefact collectors doesn’t ring true for a moment. Nor, sad to say, does the netherworld itself, which largely consists of Antonio Banderas’s gravelly oligarch and his small team of henchmen, one of whom is armed with a non-native Scottish accent which – hoots, mon – even Russ Abbot might have deemed a touch de trop.  Banderas’s character is the kind of strategic mastermind who will murder an enemy in broad daylight in a car park beside a major tourist hotspot – while a plot twist that feels more like the result of a scheduling clash than screenwriter daring leaves him offscreen for the film’s entire third act, during which Tati Gabrielle’s Braddock, a knife-toting mercenary, finds herself promoted to villain-in-chief by default.  At this point, things mercifully warm up a bit. The climactic action sequence, which takes place across two ancient galleons as they're airlifted from an island cave to a waiting cargo ship, is a nice idea well executed, even if the scene’s improbable physics attest to Uncharted's video-game roots.  Elsewhere, the action is dire from every angle: lots of pushing artefact A onto plinth B in order to make secret door C wobble open.  There’s also a fight in and outside an aeroplane’s cargo hold in the rough style of the iconic stunt from The Living Daylights, which the film is evidently so pleased with that it shows it off twice: once in truncated form in a quick flash-forward prologue, then again in full when it occurs in the course of the plot around two thirds of the way through the film.  But every frame is so obviously green-screened, airbrushed and otherwise climate-controlled that it unfolds without a squeak of peril – the stakes couldn’t have felt lower if an extra-life counter were sitting in the corner of the screen. As for the script, you can almost hear the words NEEDS TO BE FUNNIER written in capital letters in the margins at least once per scene. Even as a test of Holland’s star power beyond the Marvel franchise, Uncharted feels like an ill-advised choice. He’s just too lamblike to convince as an open-shirted heartthrob in the Harrison Ford mould, and his chemistry with Sophia Ali, who plays on-off adventuring partner Chloe, is foot-shufflingly meek.  Of course, when a whole generation of stars have been purpose-grown for franchises that shrink in horror from human sensuality, this is the embarrassing result. Buried treasure in the Philippines is all well and good, but wait until you hear about sex.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 11, 2022"," With laser-guided precision, with the exactitude of a Nobel-winning rocket scientist or a world-class neurosurgeon, this film measures right up to what you’d expect from a movie based on a PlayStation video game. It’s a huge greenscreen action-adventure with a reasonable bang-buck ratio, but a box office algorithm where its heart is supposed to be. It’s all about a couple of ripped guys on the trail of some lost 16th-century gold belonging to legendary explorer Ferdinand Magellan; the film cheerfully rips off Indiana Jones, the National Treasure films with Nicolas Cage, and there’s a touch of The Goonies in there somewhere. Tom Holland has been doing some serious work with his personal trainer for his role as Nathan Drake, a tough kid with serious abs and a talent for parkour that looks like it is only partly faked with a stunt double. He is now making a few bucks as a cocktail waiter but he’s also a pickpocket, ripping off rich people in the bar – and dreaming of finding Magellan’s loot, which his adored older brother once told him about before mysteriously going missing. It’s then that Sully Sullivan (played by a detached Mark Wahlberg, who is maybe not entirely engaged with a second fiddle role) comes up to the light-fingered Nate in his bar with a proposition: a scene pinched from George Clooney meeting Matt Damon for the first time in Ocean’s Eleven. They can team up to search for the gold, and maybe find Nate’s brother, too. But in doing so, they come across some tough customers: gold hunter Chloe (Sophia Ali) and ice-cold martial arts warrior Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) who is in the pay of the smooth-voiced bad guy Moncada (Antonio Banderas). The lovable rogues bop around from glamorous location to glamorous location and the whole thing runs smoothly enough, with some spectacular touches. Holland gives it his all, but the rest of the cast look a little less committed. An efficient, soulless hologram of a film.",NEUTRAL

A film adaptation of the Uncharted game series has been in development for the best part of two decades – so long, in fact, that Mark Wahlberg, now cast as mentor figure Sully, was originally due to play hero Nathan Drake (now Tom Holland). The biggest problem for the series was that the games began as an Indiana Jones wannabe, and escaping that long fedora’ed shadow was no easy feat. Finally, it arrives as a prequel, with a younger Drake taking his first steps as a treasure hunter. When we meet him as an adult, in fact, he’s a bartender and pickpocket – but we know, from a childhood opening scene, that he’s also a history nut from a long line of treasure hunters. Wahlberg’s Sully recruits him to find the lost treasure of Magellan, promising him clues to his lost brother’s whereabouts on the way. But ranged against billionaire Santiago Moncado (Antonio Banderas) and his hitlady Braddock (Tati Gabrielle), and with one of the clues in the hands of the untrusting Chloe Frazer (Sophia Ali), it won’t be easy. Cue people falling from planes, underground chases, traps and puzzles – all present and correct from the games. But despite the usually steadying hand of Zombieland’s Ruben Fleischer as director, the tone is uneasy. In Holland’s first scene he apologises to a faceless henchman, which is far too Peter Parker for Drake. It’s as if the studio didn’t trust his charisma away from Spider-Man – although they should – and while his performance is good the script puts his characterisation all over the place. Wahlberg, too, is given a Sully who is far less supportive than in the games, actively prickly and sometimes outright hostile. The film seems to be going with a Pirates of the Caribbean-style approach where absolutely everyone is untrustworthy all the time, and in an adventure caper like this it’s nice to have actual friends here and there. Still, the spectacle is achieved rather impressively, with a protracted but fun plane sequence, a two-level hunt through Barcelona and a visually original finale that is a little too CG-heavy but undeniably full of visual dazzle. There still hasn’t been a truly great film based directly on a video game, and the characterisations here are more likely to annoy than delight the hardcore fans, but the jetsetting and sunshine here is a welcome break from more serious action movies, and Holland will just about hold the interest.  By entering your email address you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy and consent to receive emails from Time Out about news, events, offers and partner promotions.

"Feb 11, 2022","The Uncharted movie may pilfer from assorted better films, but it's a victimless crime. ",POSITIVE
"Feb 11, 2022"," The idea of swashbuckling has somewhat fallen out of favour in Hollywood. We’re a long way removed from Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn swinging swords around and it’s been decades since anybody cared about Captain Jack Sparrow and the other alumni of the Pirates Of The Caribbean franchise. But my personal taste of adventure was satisfied recently by the unlikeliest of movies – a video game adaptation. Uncharted – based on the Naughty Dog franchise of treasure-hunting PlayStation games – has had a turbulent and winding path to the big screen. At least seven directors have been attached at one time or another, with the project in some form of development as far back as 2008. But in 2020, Venom filmmaker Ruben Fleischer signed up to helm the movie for a 2021 release, with Tom Holland as protagonist Nathan Drake and Mark Wahlberg as his mentor – seasoned treasure pilferer Sully. COVID-19 put the kibosh on the initial filming plan but, a year later than initially scheduled, the movie is finally seeing the light of day. Plot-wise, there’s nothing here to break the mould. Sully tracks down Drake for help in finding the ultimate treasure hunter prize – a stash of billions of dollars in gold, previously sought by Ferdinand Magellan. Uber-rich businessman Moncada (Antonio Banderas) is also on the hunt for the lucrative bounty, with deadly mercenary Braddock (a brilliantly dangerous Tati Gabrielle) willing to do his dirty work. While too many movies based on video games bog themselves down in dense lore and crowbarred fan service, Uncharted is a pleasantly pared-down piece of work. Rather than attempt to adapt every facet of the games’ stories or replicate the feeling of playing them – something cinema can never really hope to do – Fleischer is content to tell a simple, enjoyable action-adventure story. As it turns out, that might well be the secret to cracking the nut of making a video game film that actually works. Of course, it helps to have one of Hollywood’s most dependable leading men on the marquee and Tom Holland breathes real life into Nathan Drake. We first meet him charming a young woman with his impressive salesman patter and bartending skills – before stealing her watch – and his charisma keeps the movie chugging along, even as it traffics in some slightly ropey CGI when it reaches for big action sequences in the final third. Banderas, meanwhile, hams it up as one of his typically enjoyable villains and British cinema stalwart Steven Waddington does stellar work as a comedy-accented Scottish henchman. Certainly the movie could never be accused of subtlety, with Wahlberg’s brash Sully – who sometimes feels ported over from a different take on the material (and possibly was) – clearly positioned as an ersatz father figure for Nate and Sophia Ali’s Chloe Frazer serving as one of many underused elements seemingly introduced with one eye on franchise potential. But Uncharted is at its best when it’s not worrying about being an adaptation or firing the starting pistol on a blockbuster series. When it embraces the potential to be silly and spectacular, it’s an absolute delight. A foot chase along the rooftops of Barcelona gets the pulse racing and a climactic skirmish involving pirate ships dials up the ludicrousness to absurd levels. This is often just a movie about attractive people in vests chasing after preposterous MacGuffins and solving intricate clues – and that feels like a throwback in the best and most entertaining way. Uncharted has three credited screenwriters in the shape of Rafe Lee Judkins, Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, with two further scribes credited for assisting with the story. If that sounds like a lot of cooks in the kitchen, that’s certainly born out by the slightly muddled feel of the finished film. The tone lurches wildly throughout, with several of the most broadly comedic moments – particularly an awkward running gag about a cat – feeling as if they were randomly tacked on out of fear that the movie wasn’t funny enough. As entertaining as the film can be at its all-action best, it often feels as if it doesn’t have the confidence of its own convictions and hedges its bets in an attempt to be all things to all audiences. It remains to be seen whether Uncharted will work with those who are more devoted fans of the games than I am but, from a purely cinematic perspective, it’s an enjoyable adaptation in the vein of the surprisingly entertaining Alicia Vikander-led take on Tomb Raider which surfaced in 2018. It’s further proof that Tom Holland is a rare example of that most valuable Hollywood commodity – a bona fide, old school movie star. Certainly Uncharted shows he can swashbuckle with the best of them.

"Feb 11, 2022"," With 2022 set to be the year of big-budget video game adaptations for both movie studios and streaming services – with the Sonic the Hedgehog sequel, Paramount+ Halo series and the HBO The Last of Us series all proving highly anticipated IPs  – Sony Pictures Entertainment are hedging their bets on one of their biggest game franchises.  Developed by studio Naughty Dog, Uncharted is one of the most loved and successful Playstation games to date, with the latest instalment – Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End – reportedly hitting over 15 million individual copies sold. Despite the success of the games, the journey to the big screen hasn’t always been plane sailing, with Hollywood attempting to adapt the series for roughly 15 years. The film entered development back in 2008, with multiple directors and stars attached to the project, including Nathan Fillion, Zachery Levi, Ryan Reynolds, Jensen Ackles and even Mark Wahlberg all rumoured for the role of lead Nathan Drake. However, it wasn’t until Tom Holland pitched a young Bond film to Sony Pictures that he was consequently offered the role, finally propelling the live-action origin project to fruition. Directed by Ruben Fleischer, Uncharted centres on young bartender Nathan ‘Nate’ Drake (Tom Holland) as he’s recruited by Victor “Sully” Sullivan (Mark Wahlberg) for a heist job. Tasked to retrieve an ancient artefact from an auction linked to explorer Ferdinand Magellan and his lost treasure, the pair quickly find themselves embroiled in a global race against time, with the ruthless Moncada (Antonio Banderas) and his minions hot on their heels. With numerous clues to decipher linking to his long-lost brother Sam (Rudy Pankow), Nate might just find the answers – and riches – he’s been searching for. With the ‘curse’ of live-action game adaptations looming, fans of the beloved series have been waiting with bated breath since the first-look images and trailers were released. However, unlike the most recent Tomb Raider adaption, Fleischer sticks closely to the source material, with the essence of the game series woven throughout the story beats and action set-pieces. Acting as an origins tale, the film opens with a flashback of the hero and his brother in their younger years at the orphanage, tapping predominantly into the Young Drake storyline from Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End.  Launched with the aim of setting up a larger franchise, the Venom director does well to establish the universe with a real sense of adventure, as you’re swept along on a globe-trotting treasure hunt filled with ancient maps, clues and booby traps aplenty. For the most part, it’s a fun popcorn blockbuster which ticks all the action-adventure boxes, with a sentimental story of found family at its core. However, just as the film hits its stride with an impressive hidden tunnel and chase sequence, Fleischer forgoes this more Indiana Jones inspired approach in favour of a more bombastic CGI fest, rushing from one clue to the next in order to reach the bonkers Fast and the Furious-esque finale. Unfortunately this results in a disappointingly clunky and uneven affair, particularly following a questionable development. Thankfully the charismatic central partnership of Holland and Wahlberg helps steer the ship throughout the more bumpy moments. While Holland isn’t quite the happy-go-lucky Nathan Drake we all know and love yet, there’s plenty of nods to the adventurer – including his wardrobe (and signature brown shoulder holsters), his little “oh crap” moment before being hit by a car, along with his many impressive slides and physical gymnastic flair throughout the chase sequences. Wahlberg is pretty much playing himself, constantly bickering with his younger partner, however his character is afforded slightly more growth throughout. On villainous duties is Banderas, who is seems to be having a blast but is surprisingly underused, while Tati Gabrielle excels in the more physical action sequences. However, the weak link is Sophia Ali as fellow treasure hunter Chloe Frazer, who’s questionable accent really is all over the place throughout. As previously mentioned, there’s plenty of entertaining fight sequences and action set pieces for action-adventure fans to enjoy, which also pay tribute to the source material. The film’s big action scene – a jump-and-fight segment unravelling midair amid cargo falling out of an airplane – is pulled straight from Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception. While the scope and scale of this scene is undeniably impressive, the visual effects are unfortunately so obvious that it feels lifted from Hardcore Henry, overtly propelling you into the action in a first-person type sequence.  For those missing globe-trotting adventures, there’s plenty of beautiful locations featured, filmed predominantly in Spain. Barcelona – particularly Palau de Nacional and La Sagrada Familia – feature heavily, along with the Catalan town of Lloret de Mar which was transformed for the Southeast Asia sequences. Unfortunately composer Ramin Djawadi potentially has his first misfire here, with a score that’s so overtly intrusive and generic – although Nate’s theme is the main highlight. With plenty of action-adventure moments and a great chemistry between Holland and Wahlberg – but also clunky world-building and dodgy visual effects – there’s just enough for fans of the games to enjoy in Uncharted. Fleischer succeeds in doing what he set out to do – creating a fun popcorn blockbuster which lays the foundations for more – but whether it has the legs to launch a fully fledged franchise is another question.

"Feb 10, 2022"," Tom Holland y Mark Wahlberg son Nathan Drake y Victor 'Sully' Sullivan en la primera película basada en los videojuegos de Naughty Dog. Una búsqueda del tesoro muy entretenida y de gran escala. Sony lleva más de diez años intentando que Nathan Drake dé el salto a la gran pantalla. Por los despachos del estudio han pasado un sinfín de directores, de guionistas y de potenciales protagonistas (curiosamente Mark Wahlberg fue uno de los que más cerca estuvo, pero ya volveremos a él) que nunca llegaron a dar con una idea que realmente fuese a contentar a los fans de una de las franquicias de videojuegos más importantes de PlayStation (y ahora también PC) a la vez que funcionase como una película. Fue Tom Holland con su loquísima idea de una historia de origen para James Bond quien llevó a los ejecutivos del estudio a pensar que quizás hacer otra película con el Nathan Drake que ya conocemos de los píxeles era redundante. Los juegos de 'Uncharted' ya son maravillosas películas de aventuras, con el valor añadido de hacernos protagonistas de la acción. ¿Pero y si la película sirviera para cubrir huecos que no hemos visto en los juegos, a la vez que permiten darnos un Nathan diferente por estar en un punto vital diferente? Por fin encontraron un hilo que merecía la pena tirar, y encima con el actor estrella del estudio, el joven que les ha llevado a batir récords de taquilla en plena pandemia. Así se convirtió Tom Holland en un Nate de 25 años que trabaja como camarero y carterista aficionado en un bar de Nueva York. Allí se cruza por primera vez con Victor Sullivan, Sully para los amigos, que aprecia el talento de Drake para quedarse con lo que no es suyo y le ofrece un golpe mucho mayor. Muchísimo mayor. El tesoro de Magallanes. Supuestamente el botín más grande de la historia que jamás ha sido encontrado. Aquí comienza la carrera como cazatesoros de Nate, y esa amistad entre dos de los personajes más carismáticos que nos han dado los videojuegos en los últimos años.Ruben Fleischer ('Venom') ha sido finalmente quien ha tomado las riendas de este proyecto y lo ha llevado a buen puerto. En varias entrevistas ha remarcado que su principal objetivo era hacer primero una buena película y no centrarse antes en contentar a los fans de los juegos. Por eso han optado por no adaptar una de las aventuras que ya conocíamos sino crear una enteramente nueva, aunque esté plagada de reminiscencias a la saga creada por Naughty Dog. 'Uncharted' es, primero, una película de aventuras de corte muy clásico, y en eso es un auténtico triunfo. Los videojuegos también lo eran. Tenemos todo lo que un fan de Indiana Jones podría pedir: localizaciones repartidas por el mundo, mapas, diarios llenos de enigmas, datos históricos random, tesoros, llaves, cerraduras, pasadizos secretos, trampas... Hasta la transición de un lugar a otro es un avión recorriendo el globo terráqueo.La película es de una escala gigantesca y cuenta con un ritmo estupendo que sabe aprovechar las algo menos de dos horas que dura. Junto a Nate viajaremos de Nueva York a escenarios como una Barcelona que ocupa mucha parte del metraje (y que nos da momentos maravillosos como una persecución por Montjuic) o la costa de Filipinas. Tenemos peleas, tenemos escenas de acción que son un espectáculo visual por muy ""fantasmada"" que sean, y tenemos una búsqueda del tesoro que no tiene mayor pretensión de hacernos disfrutar. Fleischer y el equipo de la cinta han logrado que la película sea accesible a cualquier espectador, conozca o no los videojuegos. Aunque obviamente no inventa nada que no hayamos visto en otras películas de aventuras previas (el videojuego tampoco huyó nunca de las comparaciones con Indy o con 'Tomb Raider'), al no ser un género precisamente muy prolífico últimamente, lo que consigue es una buena sensación de déjà vu, de que apetecía un montón una aventura así, un viaje por el mundo en busca de tesoros. Siguiendo la estela de 'La búsqueda (National Treasure)' o de los propios videojuegos, 'Uncharted' es una fantástica actualización del género sin obviar lo que hace a estas películas tan divertidas.Pero no se olvida para nada de los fans que sí han recorrido un montón de kilómetros junto a Nathan Drake. 'Uncharted' consigue tenernos tan entretenidos que los que hemos jugado a los videojuegos viviremos pocas veces esa extraña sensación de no tener el mando en la mano y estar tomando las decisiones. Pero la película sabe mantener el ADN del juego. Toda ella es una búsqueda de guiños y Easter Eggs a detalles de la franquicia, desde la recreación directa de la escena del avión de 'Uncharted 3', digna de cualquier película de Tom Cruise (aunque en esta haya mucha más ""magia del cine"" involucrada), a detalles del vestuario de Nate, localizaciones como el orfanato donde se criaron los hermanos Drake, e incluso el cameo del Nathan Drake original: Nolan North. El uso del tema principal de la banda sonora del videojuego es un auténtico subidón.Tu amigo y vecino... ¿Nate?Más allá de los guiños, 'Uncharted' funciona relativamente bien como ""episodio desconocido"" de la historia de Nathan. Aunque toma varios elementos de 'Uncharted 4', como la subasta, descarta el flashback del primer encuentro entre Nate y Sully y cuenta su propia historia en la que la desconfianza es la primera lección que tiene que aprender Nathan del mundo en el que se va a meter. Cuando conocemos a este Nate cinematográfico encontramos a un joven inteligente, muy seguro de sí mismo y con bastantes buenos reflejos. Pero también es un inocentón que irá viendo cómo su nuevo compinche, y todo el que se cruza en la búsqueda del tesoro, tiran a ser bastante egoístas y por muy buena relación que forjen siempre hay que tener un punto de duda. Nunca te puedes fiar de un ladrón, aunque creas que es tu aliado. Este toque más naif es el principal cambio respecto a los videojuegos, un viaje al pasado para entender cómo Nathan Drake se convierte en la persona que llegará a ser. Y aunque esta versión tiene potencial, no puede escapar de un gran problema: Tom Holland. Y no quiero que se me entienda mal. El actor está volcado en el personaje al 200%, y sigue siendo un gustazo verlo en pantalla. Pero aunque valoro que haya intentado cambiar su forma de moverse para parecer más adulto, o que se haya machacado en el gimnasio para ganar más masa muscular, al ser una versión a medio cocer de Nathan Drake no me quito de la cabeza a Peter Parker cuando le veo. Tanto él como la película, que por alguna razón busca constantemente la excusa para ponerle una bebida alcohólica en la mano, intentan huir de la imagen de niño que tenemos de él, pero su cara, su complexión y que le acabemos de ver hace tan poco de nuevo como Spider-Man no consigue que disociemos los dos personajes y sigamos viendo a nuestro amigo y vecino. Incluso en el tema de la violencia, pasamos del letal Nathan Drake que deja un reguero de cadáveres a su paso (como impera en los videojuegos) a un Nate más inexperto en esa materia pero que llega hasta a pedir perdón a uno de los matones que golpea. De nuevo, Holland ha hecho todo lo que ha podido, y aunque me encanta conocer un poco más del pasado del personaje, y funcionaría como canon dentro de la franquicia, no soy capaz de ver cómo él se convertirá en el Nathan Drake de los videojuegos.Pero por suerte lo que sí han conseguido es que él y Mark Wahlberg tengan una química maravillosa, que es en realidad de los retos más complicados que tenían en una adaptación de 'Uncharted'. Ambos se lanzan y devuelven las pullas con mucho estilo y Wahlberg sorprende para bien como Victor Sullivan, aunque no tenga todavía el bigote tan característico del personaje. Qué curioso es Hollywood. Por culpa de tantos retrasos, el que iba a hacer de Nathan Drake ha acabado haciendo de un estupendo Sully, que encaja estupendamente las bromas sobre su edad. Hablando de bromas, la película no peca de basarse en chistes constantes, como parecían augurar los tráilers.La película de 'Uncharted' también tiene un cierto problema con sus personajes femeninos y los villanos. Sophia Ali se convierte en Chloe Frazer, otra buscadora de tesoros que también viene de los videojuegos, y que se aliará a regañadientes con Nate y Sully para seguir la pista del oro de Magallanes. Tati Gabrielle es Braddock, una mercenaria contratada para encontrar el tesoro en nombre de la familia Moncada, quienes creen que el botín les pertenece por herencia. Los dos personajes tienen el mismo problema de que son bastante típicos, quizás más el de Gabrielle, rozando el que se pudieran eliminar de la película y no pasaría nada. Una pena sobre todo por Chloe, que en los videojuegos logra destacar bastante, y que aquí se queda solo en aptitudes que no acaban de explotar. Capitaneando la casa Moncada tenemos a Antonio Banderas, que tampoco tiene mucho espacio para lucirse y que acaba dando una interpretación que mezcla varias cadencias que ya le hemos visto antes. Igualmente, el actor sabe cómo aprovechar un par de momentos, sobre todo una conversación con Nathan, para dejarnos ver que sería un villano estupendo si le dejaran.A la película de 'Uncharted' le ocurre un poco lo que al primer videojuego de la saga, en el que muchos supimos ver el potencial que luego Naughty Dog desplegaría a lo grande a partir del segundo. Ruben Fleischer consigue unas bases sólidas para crear una saga de aventuras que vuelva a revitalizar el género gracias a saber darnos lo que buscamos de ellas (viajes, tesoros, acción desenfadada) y a haber encontrado dos actores que quizás no son el Nate y el Sully que tenemos en la cabeza pero que pueden llegar a serlo con el tiempo y que, sobre todo, sí que cuentan con la química necesaria para llevar la saga a cuestas. Cuando llegan las dos escenas postcréditos y se avanza lo que está por venir, la sensación es de que nos subiríamos a cualquier barco, avión o coche con ellos, a pesar de que sabemos que acabarán estrellados en una escena absolutamente espectacular. Pero a eso hemos venido, a correr peligro. Con o sin un mando en la mano.'Uncharted' está en cines desde el viernes 11 de febrero.Nota: 7Lo mejor: Como película de aventuras funciona a las mil maravillas. Está llena de guiños a los videojuegos, pero no hay que conocerlos para disfrutarla.

El actor está volcado en el personaje al 200%, y sigue siendo un gustazo verlo en pantalla. Pero aunque valoro que haya intentado cambiar su forma de moverse para parecer más adulto, o que se haya machacado en el gimnasio para ganar más masa muscular, al ser una versión a medio cocer de Nathan Drake no me quito de la cabeza a Peter Parker cuando le veo. Tanto él como la película, que por alguna razón busca constantemente la excusa para ponerle una bebida alcohólica en la mano, intentan huir de la imagen de niño que tenemos de él, pero su cara, su complexión y que le acabemos de ver hace tan poco de nuevo como Spider-Man no consigue que disociemos los dos personajes y sigamos viendo a nuestro amigo y vecino. Incluso en el tema de la violencia, pasamos del letal Nathan Drake que deja un reguero de cadáveres a su paso (como impera en los videojuegos) a un Nate más inexperto en esa materia pero que llega hasta a pedir perdón a uno de los matones que golpea. De nuevo, Holland ha hecho todo lo que ha podido, y aunque me encanta conocer un poco más del pasado del personaje, y funcionaría como canon dentro de la franquicia, no soy capaz de ver cómo él se convertirá en el Nathan Drake de los videojuegos. Pero por suerte lo que sí han conseguido es que él y Mark Wahlberg tengan una química maravillosa, que es en realidad de los retos más complicados que tenían en una adaptación de 'Uncharted'. Ambos se lanzan y devuelven las pullas con mucho estilo y Wahlberg sorprende para bien como Victor Sullivan, aunque no tenga todavía el bigote tan característico del personaje. Qué curioso es Hollywood. Por culpa de tantos retrasos, el que iba a hacer de Nathan Drake ha acabado haciendo de un estupendo Sully, que encaja estupendamente las bromas sobre su edad. Hablando de bromas, la película no peca de basarse en chistes constantes, como parecían augurar los tráilers. La película de 'Uncharted' también tiene un cierto problema con sus personajes femeninos y los villanos. Sophia Ali se convierte en Chloe Frazer, otra buscadora de tesoros que también viene de los videojuegos, y que se aliará a regañadientes con Nate y Sully para seguir la pista del oro de Magallanes. Tati Gabrielle es Braddock, una mercenaria contratada para encontrar el tesoro en nombre de la familia Moncada, quienes creen que el botín les pertenece por herencia. Los dos personajes tienen el mismo problema de que son bastante típicos, quizás más el de Gabrielle, rozando el que se pudieran eliminar de la película y no pasaría nada. Una pena sobre todo por Chloe, que en los videojuegos logra destacar bastante, y que aquí se queda solo en aptitudes que no acaban de explotar. Capitaneando la casa Moncada tenemos a Antonio Banderas, que tampoco tiene mucho espacio para lucirse y que acaba dando una interpretación que mezcla varias cadencias que ya le hemos visto antes. Igualmente, el actor sabe cómo aprovechar un par de momentos, sobre todo una conversación con Nathan, para dejarnos ver que sería un villano estupendo si le dejaran. A la película de 'Uncharted' le ocurre un poco lo que al primer videojuego de la saga, en el que muchos supimos ver el potencial que luego Naughty Dog desplegaría a lo grande a partir del segundo. Ruben Fleischer consigue unas bases sólidas para crear una saga de aventuras que vuelva a revitalizar el género gracias a saber darnos lo que buscamos de ellas (viajes, tesoros, acción desenfadada) y a haber encontrado dos actores que quizás no son el Nate y el Sully que tenemos en la cabeza pero que pueden llegar a serlo con el tiempo y que, sobre todo, sí que cuentan con la química necesaria para llevar la saga a cuestas. Cuando llegan las dos escenas postcréditos y se avanza lo que está por venir, la sensación es de que nos subiríamos a cualquier barco, avión o coche con ellos, a pesar de que sabemos que acabarán estrellados en una escena absolutamente espectacular. Pero a eso hemos venido, a correr peligro. Con o sin un mando en la mano. Lo mejor: Como película de aventuras funciona a las mil maravillas. Está llena de guiños a los videojuegos, pero no hay que conocerlos para disfrutarla. La química que tienen Tom Holland y Mark Wahlberg. Lo peor: Tom Holland no logra quitarse de encima el halo ""Peter Parker"". Los villanos y los personajes de Sophia Ali y Tati Gabrielle son bastante planos.",POSITIVE
