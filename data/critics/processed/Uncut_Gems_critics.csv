"Apr 4, 2024","Regardless of how and why, Uncut Gems is a unique rollercoaster experience matched by nothing else in 2019.",POSITIVE
"Jul 26, 2023"," As the lights go down and Adam Sandler springs to frenetic life as protagonist Howard Ratner, a New York Diamond District sleaze, you might muse as to why it took so long for someone of his boorish, magnetic ilk to get a star turn in a film. You may also wonder, there in the dark with your coreligionists, if non-Jews are really ready to encounter Ratner without viewing him as proof of certain ethnically-charged judgments. Sure, the American public has been primed to accept a certain sanitized yiddishkeit via “Seinfeld” and the schtick of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen. And courtesy of two other filmmaking brothers, Joel and Ethan Coen, cinephiles have lately become fluent in another more serious mode of Jew: the tortured schlemiel haunted by ancestral anxiety. But the Howard Ratners of the world have rarely been allowed on screen on their own terms, or with such specificity. Surely, film history has no dearth of stereotypically greedy, sex-crazed or slovenly Chosen, but never ones so thoroughly and meticulously rendered by and for Jews. Jewish auteurs’ resistance to examining a Ratner is understandable. There’s a justifiable fear that such characters are a shanda far di Goyim. Ratner is a man driven by vice and flagrant in presentation, adorned with rimless glasses, diamond-pierced ears and a prized Knicks championship ring glued to his finger. He’s also the type of guy who forgets to remove the tags from his shirts. He is irrepressible, grating and yet somehow hard to hate as he strives for his biggest win to the detriment of all around him. The trouble begins when a crew of thuggish debt collectors come by his store. Ratner owes them 100 grand from his sports gambling habit, but he has an ace up his sleeve: The Celtics’s Kevin Garnett, who comes in that same day and promises a big payday. As it happens, Garnett, who plays himself, arrives at Ratner’s shop in the same hour as a stone-encased block of black opals from Ethiopia. Mesmerized by the stones, Garnett wants to buy them for a sum that could clear Ratner’s gambling debts. It would be a very short film if Ratner agreed to that price. Ratner thinks the gems are worth a whole lot more than Garnett’s offering, and plans to auction them for over a million. It’s the first of many poor decisions over a whiplash-inducing two hours. Howard jeopardizes his marriage and business by continuing an affair with a much younger employee, Julia (Julia Fox); pawns Garnett’s championship ring, which the power forward left him as collateral; and runs backstage at his daughter’s high school play while dodging money-seeking goons. Filmed in unsettling close-ups, punctuated by noise pollution and a synth-heavy score by Daniel Lopatin, “Uncut Gems” often feels like a personal affront to a people prone to dyspepsia. For a Jewish viewer, it will likely often be triggering in its familiarity. Ratner is a new brand of ambassador for the People of the Book, an alternative to the nebbishes and benignly annoying types we’re used to seeing, and one not so distant from villains whose portrayals flirt with — or outright buy into — anti-Semitic tropes. Your tolerance for his cringe-y behavior may best be judged by whether or not you enjoy that most Jewish of properties, “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” which is as fundamental to the film’s DNA as the anti-heroics of “The Sopranos” or “Breaking Bad.” The Safdie brothers have been working up to “Uncut Gems” for a decade. While its scope is more ambitious than their previous work, it retains their hallmarks — first-time actors (Fox, Garnett and a crew of actual jewelers), real locations and a refusal to explain the lived-in world the film presents. When Julia gets a tattoo of Howard’s name, he says, “You can’t even be buried with me now,” but doesn’t go into the halacha of it all. Howard’s kids tear up their grandfather’s house looking for the afikomen, but the film stays mum on what the afikomen is, or why it matters. Most of all, “Uncut Gems” feels no need to explain Howard Ratner, positioning him as a fact as eternal and unchangeable as the black opals he hopes to use to make his fortune. In a time of growing anti-Semitism, the choice to devote a film to an unflattering face of American Jewry might appear treacherous. In fact, it is as humanizing as it is defiant. We, like any other people, have unsavory characters who root their personal identities in our peoplehood. We should not have to make excuses for or overlook them for fear of what others might say. We need not sit shiva for them either. And, yes, we can even enjoy them. The first decade of the 2000s ended with the Coens’ “A Serious Man” (2009), a Midwestern, Jobian parable of a Jewish school teacher whose life falls apart due to his unavoidable fecklessness. With “Uncut Gems,” the Safdies take things a step further by activating a new type of Jew, concluding this decade with a New York tale of a man whose utterly avoidable actions undo him. The contrast makes one wonder what Jewish cinema might look like if we were unafraid to be obstreperous, lewd, crude and amoral. In other words, permit ourselves to show our people as just as flawed — really, just as ordinary — as everyone else. In this age of misinformation, our work is needed like never before.

"Apr 25, 2023","Uncut Gems is unlike any movie I’ve ever seen before, and more people definitely need to see it. It’s an ugly look at the horror of gambling addiction.",POSITIVE
"Mar 1, 2023","Sandler's portrayal as Howard, the degenerate gambler and jewelry man, makes us garble anxiety with his high energy running around to pay off debts while playing footsie with Kevin Garnett over a stunningly large opal.",POSITIVE
"Dec 2, 2022","Overstuffed on every level—Uncut Gems is definitely not boring, but it’s a lot, more than I can comfortably handle.",POSITIVE
"Nov 11, 2022"," Uncut Gems was a brash, bold and nerve-shredding choice for this year’s #LFF Surprise Film. One that proves writer-directors The Safdie Brothers are diamonds in the rough. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a New York jeweller who is up to his eyes in debt at the bookies. Upon receipt of an uncut opal stone, Howard sets in motion of chain of events that will either set him up for the ultimate win or find himself digging a deeper hole he won’t get out of. It has many similarities with their previous film Good Time, which drew you in to the protagonist’s story and chase for resolution. The real skill is taking characters who are not necessarily the most likeable but still have you willing them to succeed. Adam Sandler is someone who has delivered a number of questionable films over the years. To the point that finding a quality film or performance is like finding a sterling silver needle in a haystack. Yet here, he is absolutely magnetic that, just like the eponymous uncut gem, you cannot take your eyes off him. He is like a cinematic Energiser Bunny. His energy keeps the audience on the edge of their seat. Channeling that anger and charm into arguably his finest performance since Punch Drunk Love. The Safdie Brothers take that energy and use it to propel the film forward. Using Darius Khondji’s cinematography and Daniel Lopatin’s score to maintain its breakneck pace that never takes its foot off the gas for a second. It is one of the most intense movie-watching experiences of the year. Audiences will find themselves captivated and completely emotionally invested in the outcome of a basketball game… even if they are not sports fans. It was famously said that “Diamonds are a girl’s best friend”. For fans of cinema, especially those who love A24 films, Uncut Gems is your new best friend.",POSITIVE
"Aug 22, 2022",The Safdie brothers&#8217; third act is ferocious&#44; fervent&#44; and one of the most jaw-dropping of the decade&#46;,POSITIVE
"Aug 21, 2022"," I can’t tell you the last time I was genuinely curious about an Adam Sandler movie. Maybe 2002 with “Punch Drunk Love”? His latest man-child venture, the blandly titled but propulsive “Uncut Gems”, reminds us that when given the right kind material Sandler is more than capable of keeping your attention. And he certainly keeps you watching here even when other elements of the film test your endurance. “Uncut Gems” comes from the directing duo of Josh and Benny Safdie. The pair also co-wrote the film along with Ronald Bronstein. It doesn’t take long to notice the movie doesn’t have much in terms of narrative. The Safdies seem far more interested in breaking the single movie f-bomb record than really putting together a compelling plot. Obviously I’m being a little facetious, but with the exception of a character or two, no one can hardly utter a line of dialogue without it. It’s a pretty big distraction. The story is as simple as this: Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a sleazy jeweler working in New York’s Diamond District who owes some really bad people a lot of money (for what, I don’t know). We do learn he is a compulsive high-stakes sports gambler and he’ll pawn off anything for money whether it belongs to him or not. We end up following him around for over two hours as he works different angles to try and score some cash to pay off his debt. It requires a lot of lying, a lot of yelling, and a lot of avoiding various people he owes. Howard thinks he has found the answer to all his problems when he gets his hands on a rare Ethiopian opal which he values at $1 million. Normally that would be an incredible score, but Howard fails to consider his one biggest hurdle – himself. He’s a natural screw-up and after one irresponsible act here and a poor choice there he finds himself deeper in trouble than he was before. The Safdies do try to add a little depth to Howard by throwing in some scenes with his estranged wife (Idina Menzel) and kids. To no one’s surprise they don’t like him very much since he’s proven himself to be self-centered and unreliable. About the only person who does is his girlfriend-on-the-side Julia (Julia Fox) who he secretly shares an apartment with. She’ll pretty much help him with anything and forgive him regardless of what he does. None of the family scenes add much other than to establish his credentials as a crappy husband and father and also that he is Jewish. But again, the Safdies aren’t too concerned with that. They’re all about propelling forward at an adrenalized fever-pitch. The film’s aggressive pacing is relentless. There’s no nuance or complexity. It simply wants you to grab hold and brace yourself as it bulls forward. Stop to look for more and you’re going to be disappointed. One of the film’s big upsides is Darius Khondji’s kinetic cinematography. Khondji has shot several films I truly love including “Se7en” with David Fincher, “Midnight in Paris” with Woody Allen, and “Amour” with Michael Haneke. Here he creates a gritty, street-level aesthetic that maintains this steady fluorescent glow. He uses tight closeups and assertive camera movements which gives the movie some extra kick. Many have mentioned anxiety and frazzled nerves when talking about “Uncut Gems”. I didn’t really have that kind of reaction. Instead I found myself asking more questions than I should have. How has Howard not been arrested? How has he not been killed? How does he still have a business? How is he still married? How can so many people be swindled (either emotionally or in business) buy such an obvious scumbag? I guess you could argue that Howard is shrewd and charismatic. But in “Uncut Gems” all we see is him consistently failing. But again, the Safdie’s are more interested in the ride. So if you’re into what the Safdies are doing you’ll probably love this. But for others it will be similar to colonoscopy we see at the very beginning – extremely unpleasant. Sandler’s character may not be the best company, but his performance is solid. All of them are including from Lakeith Stanfield and NBA star Kevin Garnett. But I think you could make a case that this film wants to be off-putting. If so, mission accomplished. I didn’t love Good Time but I am genuinely interested in how this goes. I’m pretty sure the last movie I thought Sandler was good in was Spanglish. It has gotten a ton of praise and in many ways I can see why. If you can lock in to what it’s doing you’ll probably enjoy it. I found myself wanting something deeper. I’m still interested in seeing this just to see what Sandler would do when he’s not catering to the lowest common denominator.  Plus, I still haven’t seen anything by the Safdie Brothers though I think Good Time is the film I want to see from them first. I’m in the minority on this one it seems. Lots of people are crying Oscar nomination. I don’t see it but again, lots of people love it, and I admit Sandler is quite good in it. Highly enjoyed this movie, which shocked me as I didn’t love Good Time like everyone seemed to. Since I last stated on Twitter that it was in my top 5, I’ve since rethought that take. But, can still say it’s in my top 10 easily with only a few more “must sees” to get through. I think Star Wars is the last thing I need to see. I’ve given up on 1917 coming to my area this year. Bums me out but out of my hands. Already started a rough draft of my Top 10. Hard to believe it’s already that time of year. I think realistically I think I just can’t be bothered. I am a huge fan of both The Wedding Singer and 50 First Dates but Sandler just seems like he chooses the most ridiculous projects! He’s getting tons of praise for this one. Maybe even an Oscar nomination soon. I just couldn’t get in with it though. I feel like I’m in the minority. Bummer that you didn’t like the ride man! 😉 I liked Good Time better, but shit, a 2-hour movie has rarely flown by so fast!! I do respect what the movie is going for and it is good to see Sandler do something other than juvenile non-funny comedies. Maybe he’ll pay attention to the praise he’s getting. “The film’s aggressive pacing is relentless. There’s no nuance or complexity. It simply wants you to grab hold and brace yourself as it bulls forward. Stop to look for more and you’re going to be disappointed.” Maybe this is just me, but nowhere does it say that all films need to be really complex in order to be good. A film like “Die Hard” may not have the deepest plot in the world (terrorists seize large building, smart ex-cop in said building runs wild and eventually takes them all out), but it’s so well-crafted and well-written that I didn’t care in the slightest. Personally, I think the same is true for “Uncut Gems” as well, though I might have to watch it again in order to be sure. Also, “Uncut Gems” was heavily inspired by the directors’ father’s experiences with the NYC diamond district trade, so it’s obviously a very personal film for them. At the very least, you have to admit that it captures the lives of these rough, down-and-dirty hustlers very authentically. Nope, all films don’t have to be complex in order to be good. I have tons of reviews in my archives that prove that to be true. But sticking with your comparison, Die-Hard isn’t a deep think-piece. But it has so many other things that make it such a great film: great genre appeal, thrilling action, terrific characters, a top-notch villain, etc. It’s a film where you CAN look elsewhere and see more things worthwhile. That’s why I would call Die-Hard a significantly better film than Gems. Different genres of course but you get what I mean. Also, your review never mentions the incredible music by Daniel Lopatin (also known as Oneohtrix Point Never), which I absolutely loved. Even if you didn’t like it yourself, it’s at least worth bringing up there. Perhaps. It’s just not something that stood at to me which is why it’s not mentioned. To be honest I don’t remember a thing about the music. I do know others who really liked it though.",NEUTRAL
"Feb 22, 2022"," Uncut Gems may feel like pure chaos shot into the viewer’s brain, but it only seems that way from the countless number of reversals, switches, setbacks, and impulsive choices that befall its protagonist. Adam Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a fast-talking gambler who owns a store in New York’s diamond district. Howard’s unrelenting procession of can’t-lose hustles, unforeseen disasters, and big scores on the verge of paying off make Josh and Benny Safdie’s film an exhausting, breathless, and turbulent experience to behold. Except, every choice has been expertly rigged and wired to explode at a specific moment. The Safdies have orchestrated Howard’s life into an endless, discordant visual and aural barrage: a film of overlapping, Altmanesque dialogue; pestering cell phone calls; enforcers lingering in the distance, hoping to collect on Howard’s past-due account with a bookie. It’s a relentless disharmony that makes the viewer squirm in their seat with exhilaration and dread, as though the Safdies have tied us down in the pit and forced us to watch the pendulum swing ever closer. Though the pressure-cooker environment of the film leaves us roasting in our seats, it’s also evidence of two filmmakers in complete control of their craft.  The Safdie brothers have mastered anxiety-ridden stories about self-destructive characters perpetuating their own downfall in a series of hastily made bad decisions. Their brand of storytelling reflects the unyielding pace of their usual New York milieu, captured on actual city streets, often with real pedestrians in the shot. If there’s a template to their work, it must be Martin Scorsese’s After Hours (1985), a pulpy nightmare comedy that never lets up. Neither does the central character in the Safdies’ Daddy Longlegs (2009), about a dysfunctional father driven by impulse and his own sense of victimhood. The same is true of the heroin addicts in Heaven Knows What (2014), as well as Robert Pattinson’s desperate criminal in Good Time (2017)—the closest comparison to Uncut Gems both tonally and structurally. Both Pattinson’s and Sandler’s characters are interminable hustlers, exploiting every relationship and acquaintance before setting the bridge ablaze and mining another. The Safdies have replicated the DNA of Scorsese’s early work on the mean streets of New York and, with Scorsese executive producing, they have earned his blessing. But their efforts do more than merely clone Scorsese; they create a fascinating mutation whose limits reach the cosmos. The inspiration for Howard Ratner comes from Josh and Benny’s father, who shared stories with his children about his time working in the once-great diamond district, a largely Jewish neighborhood that has been reduced to a single block in Manhattan. Howard runs a shop with bulletproof glass doors and broken buzzer, and he tries to sell iced-out Furbies to his clientele. Despite his expensive inventory, he owes thousands to a fed-up bookie (Eric Bogosian), not that his debts prevent him from pawning items he doesn’t own to secure cash for another in a long line of sure-thing bets. His wife, a strained Idina Menzel, has stopped humoring him with affection. And no wonder, since Howard keeps a mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), also his employee at the shop, in a separate apartment. But the story, set in 2012, kicks into gear with the arrival of Boston Celtics basketball champ Kevin Garnett, playing himself. Garnett is the latest client of Demany (Lakieth Stanfield), Howard’s partner who calls him a “fucking crazy-ass Jew.” Demany wrangles customers into the shop for Howard, and though the All-Star plans to buy a watch, his presence is kismet—at this same moment, Howard receives a long-awaited package. Wrapped in plastic and styrofoam and hidden inside the stomach of a bagged fish is a rare, almost otherworldly, unpolished black opal the size of a large mango.  The opening sequence transitions from the opal’s spatial iridescence into Howard’s colonoscopy, implanting an immediate sense of dread over the exam’s results. If there’s another inspiration for the Safdies, it’s the Coen brothers’ A Serious Man (2009), about a beleaguered Jewish protagonist whose punishing trials—including the dreaded results of a medical exam—have almost biblical consequence. Much like the Coens’ Larry Gopnik, Howard scrambles to find some grand purpose to his life. He agrees to lend the opal to Garnett, who believes the stone to be a good-luck charm, in exchange for the player’s diamond-encrusted championship ring. It’s a temporary swap, as Howard needs the opal for an upcoming auction, where he expects it to fetch nearly a million dollars, especially with Garnett’s interest. Is the basketball player’s sudden presence a sign in Howard’s destiny with the opal? Almost immediately, Howard leaves his shop to temporarily pawn Garnett’s ring, securing him $21,000 for a bet, on Garnett’s game no less. It’s a bold move and just the latest in Howard’s juggling of maneuvers to get ahead, which proceed onward without the slightest consideration of their personal or professional consequences. Howard craves the possibility of winning regardless of the cost, and the Safdies have littered enough small victories throughout the tense narrative that we come to understand his addiction.  Uncut Gems cannot be called a pleasant experience. It’s like being forced to take a double dose of uppers and dance barefoot on a floor littered with broken glass. Much like Good Time, it thrills even as the viewer recoils from the frantic ride and the strained morality of its central anti-hero. Many will reject the film as unpalatable and deeply nasty, but it’s an unquestionable joy when filmmaking of this caliber propels the viewer and manipulates us at every jittery turn. From the Safdie’s oversight of the film’s squirm-inducing scenes to the brilliant, hypnotic score by Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never), which sounds like the lovechild of Vangelis and Tangerine Dream, Uncut Gems never stops stimulating. All the while, Sandler’s performance is so pitch-perfect, just the right blend of detestable yet charming, that he almost makes us forget about our foreboding. What could be more appropriate for a compulsive gambler who fails to recognize his pattern of behavior? It’s a testament to the Safdie brothers’ enveloping schema that, in the climactic scenes, when Howard seems to have masterminded his escape from under the boot of his many creditors, we actually believe he might come out ahead.

"Oct 22, 2021"," What’s the best movie I can watch on Netflix? We’ve all asked ourselves this question, only to spend the next 15 minutes scrolling through the streaming service’s oddly specific genre menus and getting overwhelmed by the constantly shifting trend menus. Netflix’s huge catalog of movies continues to expand day by day, week by week, month by month. This makes the challenge of keeping up to date with best the service has to offer — let alone finding something the best of what to watch after a long day — a task that feels herculean at best and impossible at worst for someone not plugged into its inscrutable rhythms. We’re here to help. For those suffering from choice paralysis in February, we’ve narrowed down your options to not only our favorite current movies on the platform, but the best movies Netflix has to offer. If you’re looking for a specific genre, we’ve got the best action movies on Netflix, the best horror movies on Netflix, the best thrillers on Netflix, and the best comedy movies on Netflix ready for you. And for our readers across the pond, we have a list of the best movies on Netflix U.K. We’ll be updating this list weekly as Netflix cycles movies in and out of its library, so be sure to check back next time you’re stuck in front of the app’s home screen. Our latest update added The Killer as our editor’s pick. The Killer is too good to fit into any specific boxes. David Fincher’s latest movie, once again a Netflix-only release like Mank, feels distinctly post-genre. Sure, technically it’s a thriller about an assassin who botches a hit and has to deal with the consequences, which include a price on his head too. But it’s so much more than, like a comedy about one bad day of work, or a tragedy about a guy who loves The Smiths too much. Fincher’s real flex in The Killer is to present all of these seemingly competing genres and styles as one consistent tone where no moment ever feels out of step with another, whether it’s jokes about McDonald’s or bone-crunching fights.  Aside from Fincher’s technical skills, the other thing that makes The Killer’s dexterity possible is Michael Fassbender’s terrific performance as the assassin at the movie’s center. Fassbender goes from a winding monologues about the requirements of precision in every aspects of one’s life, to lamenting his latest fuck up in a moment’s notice without ever losing his put-on bravado. And it’s hilarious every single time. Polygon’s staff consistently keeps up with new Netflix originals and titles added to the streaming platform, adding to this list with the best movies across both Netflix productions and library titles. We prioritize quality, unique artistic vision, and variety — different genres, different eras, different vibes, different filmmaking nations — to make sure every reader finds multiple options that interest them, as well as movies they may have never encountered before. Suburban paranoia is as time-honored of an American tradition as baseball, apple pie, and redlining. In this 1989 horror comedy, Gremlins director Joe Dante taps into a wellspring of simmering communal tension and urban superstition and strikes gold. Tom Hanks stars as Ray Peterson, an overstressed homeowner trying to enjoy his weeklong vacation, if only everyone in the cul-de-sac of Mayfield Place would just leave him the hell alone. Unfortunately for him, the mysterious goings-on of his reclusive new neighbors have drawn the over imaginative ire of fellow suburbanites Art (Rick Ducommun) and Mark (Bruce Dern), who enlist Ray in a harebrained scheme to uncover what they’re absolutely certain is a murderous home-grown conspiracy.  A sleek and sexy thriller that makes hacking look extremely cool, Michael Mann’s unfairly maligned Blackhat stands tall as a high mark in digital filmmaking. It is peak Mann — if you’re not a fan of the Heat director’s work, your mileage may vary. In the film, Chen Dawai (Wang Leehom), a captain in the PLA’s cyber warfare unit, is tasked with getting to the bottom of a computer attack that melts down a nuclear power plant in Hong Kong. While liaising with the FBI investigation, Chen insists on the aid of his old friend Nicholas Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth, who has never been hotter or cooler), an imprisoned genius hacker. When Hathaway and Chen’s sister (Tang Wei), a networking engineer also helping with the case, fall for each other, it adds an extra wrinkle to an already high stakes situation. Viola Davis and Holt McCallany feature as FBI agents who aren’t super happy to have to rely on a notorious criminal. This scintillating neo-noir captures Denzel Washington as he was ascending the mountain of movie stardom, all in a brilliant story of postwar racial tensions in Los Angeles, featuring some of the best cinematography of the 1990s. Eega is a delightful slapstick romantic comedy from the director of RRR, about a fly and his human girlfriend conspiring to ruin a man’s life and then murder him for vengeance. If that doesn’t sound up your alley, I’m not sure what will. Eega tells the story of a man who is murdered by a wealthy businessman. After being reincarnated as a fly, he makes it his mission to exact vengeance on the man who killed him. As a fly. One of the smartest movies about the gig economy and our modern money struggles, Emily the Criminal was criminally (ayyy) underappreciated when it came out in 2022. The movie follows a debt-ridden woman (Aubrey Plaza) who gets involved in a credit card scam to pay off her student loans. This pulls her in the orbit of charismatic ringleader Youcef (the reliably handsome Theo Rossi), and also deeper and deeper into the world of crime, as she looks for a way out of her difficult situation. Director Bassam Tariq recently got replaced on Marvel’s upcoming Blade movie, and it’s as good a reason as any to catch up with his masterful 2019 short. Best known for the hip-hop drama Mogul Mowgli starring Riz Ahmed, Tariq’s previous movie is an enthralling documentary well worth the 21-minute running time. Earlier this week, I stumbled across a group of random posts discussing Inside Man, Spike Lee’s 2006 heist movie starring Denzel Washington. Naturally, my interest was piqued: I hadn’t seen the movie in a while and I wanted to give it another shot to see if it stood the test of time. After settling in for a rewatch, I can say without a doubt that it most definitely does.  There’s no better time than the present to watch the best Quentin Tarantino movie ever (and by some margin). I said it and I meant it. Adapted from Elmore Leonard’s terrific novel Rum Punch, this crime thriller stars the unmatched Pam Grier as a flight attendant who is caught bringing back money from Mexico for an arms dealer (Samuel L. Jackson). When a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) is assigned to pick her up, the two forge an unlikely bond in the midst of a complex scheme. Movies about the Power of Cinema™ can be self-important, saccharine, and worst of all, boring. Jigarthanda DoubleX is none of those things. A sprawling tale of gangsters, movie stars, politicians, and the people caught between them, it’s one of my favorite movies of 2023, and a truly special film. It’s the 1970s, and a coward who believes it’s his destiny to become a cop gets framed for a quadruple murder. He gets released from prison by a corrupt movie star/politician on the condition that he kills one of the lieutenants of that movie star/politician’s rival. Naturally, our coward poses as a movie director, because his target (a notorious gangster who loves Clint Eastwood) has made it his new mission in life to be the first dark-skinned movie star in India. While making their silly movie (a biopic of the gangster, of course), they fall in love with the magic of cinema and its transformative power on a personal and societal level. In 1984, director Jonathan Demme made one of the finest concert films of all-time with the Talking Heads in the raucously triumphant Stop Making Sense. A little more than three decades later, Demme’s final feature film was another joyous concert movie. Justin Timberlake + The Tennessee Kids depicts the final show of a long tour for Timberlake and his excellent backing band at the gigantic MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. In typical Demme fashion, the staging and framing of the energetic pop numbers is electric, but he also takes time to show just how much work goes into setting up and breaking down such a large production. The Oscars are this weekend (or, at least, they are when I’m writing this), so I thought it would be fitting to recommend one of the bigger Oscar snubs of the year. Yes, May December got nominated for its (great) screenplay, but it is also one of the best films of 2023 and features three of the most outstanding performances of the year, none of which had room in a stacked nominations list. The latest film from New Queer Cinema icon Todd Haynes (Carol, Safe) sees the legendary director reunite with frequent collaborator Julianne Moore for one of their most intriguing projects yet. May December follows an actor, Elizabeth (Natalie Portman), who travels to Georgia to prepare for a role based on Gracie (Julianne Moore), a woman who became a focus of national attention after sleeping with (and eventually marrying) Joe, a 13-year-old boy when their relationship first started. The Night Comes for Us just fucking whips, OK? Why waste time on subtlety and preamble; the film certainly doesn’t! Indonesian action thrillers have been enjoying a renaissance period ever since Gareth Evans’ 2011 film The Raid kicked the door down and mollywhopped everything else in sight. Timo Tjahjanto’s 2018 film certainly follows in the footsteps of Evans’ own, with The Raid star Joe Taslim starring here as Ito, a gangland enforcer who betrays his Triad crime family by sparing the life of a child and attempting to flee the country.  2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was a genuine before-and-after moment in the history of American animation. The film not only introduced a new generation of audiences to Miles Morales, but sent a shockwave through the entire industry through its pioneering approach to CGI animation that drew heavily from the texture and techniques of comic book storytelling. In short, it was a bona fide cultural phenomenon. How exactly do you top that? Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse feels like an answer to that question on several fronts; visually, tonally, and technically. Miles is faced with a personal and moral dilemma in the form of the Spot, a dimension-hopping supervillain whose vendetta against Spider-Man threatens to endanger the entire multiverse. If that weren’t enough, Miles inadvertently runs afoul of Miguel O’Hara (Oscar Isaac), the leader of a group of Spider-People from alternate universes, who believes Miles himself is the source of the problem.  This 2021 French-language animated drama centers on Makoto Fukamachi, a tenacious reporter who accidentally stumbles upon the biggest mountaineering story of the century: Proof that George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, not Sir Edmund Hillary, were the first climbers to reach the peak of Mount Everest in 1924. However, his only lead to break the story — an elusive mountain climber known as Habu Joji — has been missing for several years. Poring over the details of Joji’s life in the years preceding his disappearance, Makoto finds himself inadvertently drawn by the very same sense of accomplishment and meaning that has compelled countless climbers to crest Everest themselves. As far as horror movie premises go, it’s hard to get more fundamentally terrifying than “zombie outbreak on a train.” Yeon Sang-ho took that basic idea and ran with it to create a gory, pulse-pounding survival thriller about perseverance in the face of the apocalypse.  It’s easy to forget sometimes, but Adam Sandler really is one hell of a dramatic actor. The Safdie brothers’ 2019 crime thriller Uncut Gems was a bracing reminder of that fact, giving Sandler the opportunity to flex his chops as Howard Ratner, a duplicitous gambling addict whose chaotic attempts to play every angle — and everyone — to come out on top backfires in spectacular fashion.  The film is stacked with terrific, surprising performances, from basketball superstar Kevin Garnett’s portrayal as a fictionalized version of himself to Julia Fox’s breakout turn as Howard’s mistress, Julia. To top it off, the score is phenomenal; Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) reunites with the Safdies to deliver a mesmerizing soundtrack to Howard’s downfall, including an exquisite track inspired by the 1988 anime classic Akira.  Quality sports dramas are a rare thing in Hollywood. In Warrior, two estranged brothers — one a former Marine and onetime wrestling prodigy (Tom Hardy), the other a former MMA pro turned high school physics teacher (Joel Edgerton) — compete in a massive MMA tournament, with more at stake than just the big cash prize. Gavin O’Connor’s heartfelt siblings-destined-to-collide story features terrific central performances, terrific MMA fight scenes (second unit director J.J. Perry is a modern action legend), and a strong tournament narrative structure that holds the whole thing together.  There’s a place for movies like Alien, where a script written for a male lead character was left unchanged when a woman was cast in the role. But there’s also a place for movies like Wingwomen, an action comedy that thrives in its specificity around its characters and their experiences as women in our world. In Wingwomen, Carole (director-star Mélanie Laurent of Inglourious Basterds) has a very close and protective relationship with younger Alex (Adèle Exarchopoulos) — a found family situation. They are both caught in the web of crime lord Marraine (Isabelle Adjani) and looking for a way out. When they meet a new member of their team — skilled racer Sam (Manon Bresch) — they see an opportunity for one last score to break away from their life of crime and live peacefully together.",POSITIVE

"Jun 9, 2021"," For most of the 21st Century, Adam Sandler has been a bit of a joke. From puerile bro-comedies like Big Daddy to dumbed-down family dross à la Pixels, there was one unifying thread – it was all a bit shit. But in recent months, the Pied Piper of man-babies has enjoyed somewhat of a resurgence. Murder Mystery was Netflix’s most-watched film of 2019, Daniel Day Lewis complimented his dramatic chops and Saturday Night Live invited him back for the first time in 24 years. Uncut Gems, his new movie with indie auteurs the Safdie Brothers, is yet more proof of the ‘Re-Sandler-ssance’. Set in New York, the film follows Howard Ratner – a charismatic jeweller with a fledgling gambling addiction. Always on the lookout for the next big score, Howie’s dream of hitting it rich is counteracted by his terrible luck. After racking up debts to some of the city’s nastiest crooks, he stakes everything (family, business, love) on one final throw of the dice. As a mid-career change of direction, Uncut Gems is a masterstroke. Sandler’s been here before – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch Drunk Love was an early foray into serious drama – and Howard is yet another of the dopey-but-likeable everymen Sandler made his name with. But this seems different. Whereas Punch Drunk Love ambled around in a fog of surrealist dreamscapes, the Safdies’ crime thriller is almost unbearably tense. At 135 minutes, it should feel bloated, but at no point is the action any less than gripping. Uncut Gems is an anxiety-inducing heart-attack of a movie that grabs its audience by the throat and shakes until there’s no breath left. Short of nit-picking, there really is no way to criticise this film. Beautifully shot by cinematographer Darius Khondji (Se7en, Midnight In Paris), it has a gritty, twitchy vibe that only adds to the paranoia. As a leading man, Sandler has never been better – flipping from revved-up temper tantrum to cuddly teddy bear in seconds flat. Such is the critical acclaim his performance has received that the actor has promised to “make a crappy movie on purpose” if he doesn’t win an Oscar. After Uncut Gems, you wonder if he’s capable of that anymore. Of course, there are flashes of the Sandler of old – like the bizarre moment when he throws a punch at pop star The Weeknd. Rolling around amidst the cigarette butts on a grotty nightclub floor, the unlikely cast-mates scrap like children fighting over a new toy (in this case, Howard’s girlfriend Julia). It’s a scene we’ve seen many times in Sandler movies, but here, it just reminds us how far he’s come.",POSITIVE
"Apr 14, 2021"," What a year for the movies, and for intense reflection, both individually and collectively, about filmmaker’s own selves and the crises we are all living through. In composing my list, I tried to talk less about the things most critics have said about these films–as plenty more qualified than me are in crafting their words–and let a more personal view shine through (Spoilers through and through). Putting together a top ten list in January is also pretty tough, as there are so many films left to watch. But isn’t that always the case? Here are a few I’m still looking forward to seeing: Little Women, Honeyland, The Farewell, Motherless Brooklyn, One Child Nation, Jojo Rabbit, 1917, and Monos. Look, blockbuster cinema has been a mainstay for everyone born since the early ’80s, and the “end” of a 23-film saga is both the culmination of the most commercially ambitious cinematic feat ever and a towering specimen of the last decade’s reigning movement, franchise cinema. Lauded by fans and critics alike, it’ll probably sit out most top ten lists as being too commercial. So much of the art form is about storytelling, and bringing so many side stories and characters to a satisfying conclusion is tough, and the film blended a (rather) unpredictable plot with emotional character beats deftly enough to earn a spot on the list. Think that’s easy? Though many other franchises tried to pull it off this year (Game of Thrones, Star Wars), they ended with a mere whimper. A great example of what genre cinema can be on its best days, Rian Johnson’s whodunit takes the rules, bends them, plays with them, reverses them and then realigns them so smoothly at the end people don’t even seem shaken that a man kills himself without ever having to. Playful and reflexive, it’s a sharp critique of our time not just because of its characters, but also through its reflection of class tension and America’s resentment towards immigration. Ana de Armas has the best role and performance of her impressive career. Still, Johnson could have been a little bit bolder if his only immigrant-descendant character looked more like so many others in the country and less like, well, the next Bond girl. Allow me a little nationalistic subterfuge by placing two films on one spot. Brazilian cinema survives on tax rebates and government credit lines, not unlike similar incentives in every other country in the world, in some degree or another (even Marvel gets in rebates by filming in Georgia these days). With the swearing in of a president hell bent on eradicating the country’s artistic community, it might all go away. It’s downright sinister, as even the National Cinema Agency was forced to take down film posters in its offices and its website. Despite this, Brazilian cinema had an incredible year, winning awards in film festivals around the world, including Cannes. Bacurau is a sci-fi western with horror elements (the name of a school in the film is “Escola João Carpinteiro”, or “John Carpenter Elementary”) that paints a portrait of armed resistance against foreign aggression. Steeped in historical imagery and angst, it doesn’t really bother explaining a lot of its richness to foreign audiences. The Invisible Life, on the other hand, is a tropical melodrama that is so tactile you can practically smell all of the grime and bodily fluids presented on screen. The story of two sisters, torn apart by the men who surround them, is set in the 50s but speaks clearly to audiences today. I’m a sucker for space travel, and truly believe landing on the moon is humanity’s greatest achievement so far. To have seen our world from outside of it, feet planted on the ground of another celestial orb, is philosophically and metaphysically mind-blowing. Damien Chazelle’s First Man is an underappreciated masterpiece, and will make a great double-bill with the real thing. There are no talking heads and no voice-overs in this documentary–the images and dialogue speak for themselves. My wife and I watched this film separately because we didn’t want the stress of each other’s presence bearing down on us. We are, by no means, in the process of a separation or a divorce, but we knew that a movie with so many raves had to have that universality of feeling, that recognition of a truth being told to every viewer who sees it, even if the story being shown isn’t his or her own. I can’t even imagine how the people around Noah Baumbach might feel. Though he claims it isn’t autobiographical, there is no doubt that a lot of his life has been put onscreen for all to see. Yes, it takes place in the milieu of a white, privileged, couple, but the raw emotion and the overwhelming dehumanizing inherent in the process can be felt by everyone. Also, who wouldn’t want a spin-off series with Laura Dern and Ray Liotta, squaring off against each other every week, with guest appearances by Alan Alda every once in a while? Kudos for the funniest sequence of the year, at least in my book: the one where Charlie (Adam Driver) cuts himself while showing off a childish stunt. Though there are no men in this sumptuous period romance, they are the ones who have set the rules around Marianne’s (Noémie Merlant) and Héloise’s (Adèle Haenel) lives. Their absence is also a metaphor for their ignorance of, or careless nature about, the issues women face amidst a patriarchal society (in that sense, it speaks a little to The Invisible Life, number 8 on this list). High cliffs are a constant landscape in this short-term Eden, but the interesting thing about this story is that the culmination of its tragedy is not that one of the women will throw herself to death in a cliché-ed act of rebellion, but that they will go on with their lives, unable to make their own choices. Every single time Adam Sandler decides to turn off auto-pilot, people are surprised at how good of an actor he really is. It hasn’t been news for almost 20 years, though, but what remains a surprise is that his charisma is enough to sustain affection for someone as loathsome as Howard Ratner, the jeweler with a gambling problem in the Safdie brother’s newest ulcer-inducing joyride. They, like the Coens, will put their characters through hell while still maintaining some type of affection for them. The film isn’t just a rollercoaster ride, but also a screed on Man’s fascination with shiny things and greed, with a prologue that calls to mind The Exorcist‘s unleashing of a demonic curse and an Oscar-moment screed from Ratner to Kevin Garnett, inspired casting. Supporting characters are played by veteran actors and locals. Though Ratner’s fate is hardly in doubt (even if he survived the film it would be only a matter of time), the Safdies solve this obviousness with a gunshot so sudden it still takes you by surprise. Julia Fox is a find, and the fate of her character, and all that money, is left deliciously ambiguous. It’s only been 2 years since The Meyerowitz Stories, so maybe the intervals where Sandler is a little more willing to take risks are growing shorter. Many critics’ #1 choice, but I still can’t forgive that 3rd act introduction of an almost literal monster that betrays the film’s intricate structure. It was as if Bong Joon-Ho had designed a puzzle so perfect, he didn’t know what to do next and thus resorted to a reverse deus ex-machina not to save his characters, but to condemn them. Still, everything that happens is still an incredible exploration of class struggle and the illusion of upward mobility. Of the many other films that explored inequality this year, Parasite is the most inventive and thrilling. The Brazilian press is also high on the film, and I have to say, this isn’t the kind of movie I’d expect from South Korea. The country is supposed to have its sh*t together, and to witness such a plot taking place there is to witness how far of a crisis liberal capitalism is really in around the world. It is striking to consider how much Parasite and Jordan Peele’s Us have in common, from the reflective image of two families to the underground metaphor. A great double bill about inequality in 2019. It’s a lazy description, but also true: The Irishman is the anti-Goodfellas. Not just in de-glamorizing how its characters feel about being in the mafia, but especially in its contemplative pace and lack of virtuoso momentum. De Niro as Frank Sheeran never seems to have any ambition other than being a workingman mafioso, but that line at the end, “what kind of a man makes a phone call like that?”, boy, is that telling. It reminded me of a moment in Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing, where one of the genocidal members of Indonesia’s past military dictatorship, while fishing, mentions that he still has nightmares of old victims. Of course, that is little consolation to those who died and those who remain alive, but it still is some kind of damnation, a small sliver of hell. Critics who have admonished Tarantino’s playfulness with history in his Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, but heaped praise on The Irishman, have some thinking to do, as Scorsese’s movie is the bigger sin. The characters and situations that take place here are presented as fact, and will be understood as such by the public, transforming a work that has been largely discredited into History with a capital ‘H’. For a little heartbreak, just try reading this op-ed in the New York Times.  While cinema is not to be restrained by reality, it is the double standard with which this film is judged that kept it at number 2 for me. Also, Joe Pesci makes it clear he is a national treasure. For me, Tarantino made a comeback this year. Nobody thought he was gone, of course, but those people might not have realized that his true muse was editor Sally Menke, who passed away in 2010. She was right there with him, from Reservoir Dogs to Inglorious Basterds, even in that rarely-mentioned short from Four Rooms. While the violence in his films grew at a steady pace, it would gain an odd masturbatory affect in the two films that followed her death, Django Unchained and The Hateful Eight. To me, Menke seemed to contain his worst excesses. Finally, with Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood, he shows a little bit of restraint again, and is more interested in exploring affection between his characters rather than contempt and vengeance. Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton, when talking about Roman Polanski, isn’t possessed by the resentful envy of someone who’s passed his prime and is being forced to step aside by a younger generation, but admiration and awe. The sequence at Spahn Ranch is terrifying, and Brad Pitt’s never been better. Dalton’s trailer meltdown and subsequent tour de force performance as a Western Black Hat is invigorating, and the violent denouement is less than 5 minutes long in a 161-minute movie. The whole thing is a journey of affection–for its characters, setting, and culture. The inadvertent saving of Sharon Tate was no surprise to me, it seemed like the only tasteful thing for him to do, and Inglorious Basterds had already set a precedent. I spent a while unsure of what to think of it, and while all complaints make good points, I just let myself feel happy that, for a moment, cinema seemed capable of avenging a terrible crime. It was risky, ambitious, and uplifting.",POSITIVE
"Mar 13, 2021"," The Safdie Brothers follow up their electrifying breakout film Good Time with an antagonistic, adrenaline shot of a movie. The pair, Josh and Benny, have spent years creating a catalogue of flawed and desperate thrill-seekers that are often based on reality. With Uncut Gems they carve out a caustic, compulsive gambler, NYC hustler and jewellery dealer who sells diamond-encrusted Furbies, among other gaudy items. Adam Sandler stars as Howard Ratner – a character who can only be described as a complete piece of work. He’s spent the majority of his life taking risks on high-stakes sports bets, eventually landing himself in hot water with the bookies he’s been taking for a ride. Ten years in the making, Sandler turned down early versions of the script, with names such as Harvey Keitel and Sacha Baron Cohen attached along the way. Sandler’s eventual agreement proved to be a coup for the ambitious filmmakers, as he strikes gold with an unforgettable performance that blends traits from both his mainstream comedies, such as Happy Gilmore, and arthouse fare, such as Punch-Drunk Love. The film excels at plunging us into the mindset of Ratner and the terrible decisions he makes, with gritty cinematography and kinetic camerawork from Darius Khondji, a manic and occasionally giggle-inducing soundtrack of synth, percussion and woodwind from Daniel Lopatin, and a melancholy edge drummed up by Sandler’s sensational turn. The NY diamond district is used with an eye for detail and authenticity, with real-life jewellers cast to strike a discordant ambience as fiery negotiations take place and fast deals are made. The meeting point between materialistic wealth and spiritual and physical wellness is examined via an opening scene where we are witness to an accident, as Ethiopian miners search for a rare black opal and are then magically guided up Ratner’s anus as he’s undergoing a colonoscopy. From the very start it spits in the face of the capitalist nightmare with heaps of humour and a captivating oddness. It crafts an atmosphere that can be equated to the highs and lows of living in a gig economy – a place where people relentlessly worry about money and feverishly live off the whiff of social media likes. Ratner chooses an opulent lifestyle and is met with few admirers and many detractors. The supporting cast is a bold mix of actors and real people who all add their unique charm to a simmering portrait of a man who does not think about the repercussions of his actions for those around him. Idina Menzel plays his long-suffering wife, Dinah, who is sick and tired of his BS. Julia Fox, as his mistress and employee, inexplicably adores him and Lakeith Stanfield‘s fellow wheeler and dealer pushes Ratner to new and deserved extremes of misery. Meanwhile, basketball player Kevin Garnett and The Weeknd both play themselves and get gleeful moments to wind up the central character into fits of jealousy and rage. Eric Bogosian’s intensely intimidating turn is also one of many highlights. The breakneck speed at which a sweaty, flustered Ratner persistently lands himself in trouble recalls the stressful experience of watching Elaine May’s nail-biting 1976 crime thriller Mikey and Nicky starring Peter Falk and John Cassavetes.

"Feb 17, 2021","  The concept of the anti-hero is always something that makes the audience question their own morality. What does it say about us when we’re rooting for Bonnie & Clyde, Walter White, or Tony Soprano to succeed in their misdeeds? Of course, usually anti-heroes have at least shreds of redeeming qualities, something that can’t be said of the protagonist at the center of Uncut Gems.  Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a jewelry shop owner in New York who caters to high-end clients like NBA star Kevin Garnett. He’s also brash, confrontational, and a degenerate gambler who owes money all over town. He has a beautiful wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), so naturally he’s carrying on an affair with one of the workers at his shop, Julia (Julia Fox).  Howard has struck a shady deal for a raw opal from Africa that he hopes will land him big money in an auction, one in a series of high-stakes gambles that few others would take. But when Garnett takes a shine to the opal and borrows it for good luck during the playoffs, it sets off a chain of events where Howard keeps risking more and more to ensure he gets the win.  Whether you find this movie pleasurable to watch will depend on your tolerance for chaos. Written and directed by Benny and Josh Safdie, the movie starts off with the pedal to the metal and never lets up. The preferred method of communication for Howard is profane yelling, and since he’s in virtually every frame of the movie, that's what we get for the entire 135-minute running time.  Given that he has a steady stream of clients and has managed to convince not one but two beautiful women to have sex with him, Howard would seem to be a charismatic man. But that charisma is rarely on display in the film, where he chiefly comes off as out-of-control and unconvincing. It’s unclear why anyone would want to be around this guy, much less do business or have an affair with him.  The entire story is full of similar insanity. Howard’s brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) uses goons to try to get Howard to pay a debt, although said goons are hit-and-miss with their enforcement techniques. Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), a go-between who procures clients like Garnett for a fee, gives the run-around to Howard, seemingly the only person willing to call him on his demeanor.  The Safdie brothers have set the movie in 2012 seemingly just to fit Garnett into the story, and the time period and city in which it takes place bring up a few unanswerable questions. The biggest one is why Garnett, who’s shown playing for the Boston Celtics against the Philadelphia 76ers, makes multiple visits to New York during the playoff series. Even given his attachment to the gem and the relative proximity of Boston and Philadelphia, it seems a step too far to visit Howard on more than one occasion.  This is a rare chance for Sandler, who’s known for his goofy comedies, to show some dramatic chops, and he’s certainly made some interesting choices. The character is irritating as hell, but that doesn’t necessarily equate to good acting. Stanfield is much better, showing yet another side of his talent and bolstering his already-stacked résumé. Garnett is pretty good in his first film role, although it’s not exactly a stretch to play himself.  The Safdie brothers are out to make viewers into balls of stress when watching Uncut Gems, and there’s an argument to be made that their success in doing so makes it great filmmaking. Far be it from me to say that’s wrong, but I’ll pass on another experience like this one. 1. Dallas neighbor shines as the 2nd happiest city in the U.S., report finds.

"Jan 30, 2021"," 
	Director Greta Gerwig keeps the bones of Louisa May Alcott’s “Little Women” in the new big screen treatment of the 19th century story, but reshapes the March sisters’ coming-of-age in fresh and exciting ways. 
	Set at the time of the Civil War, the eighth film adaptation of the tale sees the March’s, debutant Meg (Emma Watson), strong willed Jo (Saoirse Ronan), sickly and sweet Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and self-centred Amy (Florence Pugh), with mother Marmee (Laura Dern), living a threadbare existence. The war has stripped them of whatever money they once had but they remain committed to charity—helping a destitute family down the road—and one another as they wait for the return of their father (Bob Odenkirk) from the battlefield. 
	As the story jumps through time, their lives intersect with Theodore ‘Laurie’ Laurence (Timothée Chalamet), a charming, wealthy lay-about neighbour who has designs on Jo, his millionaire uncle (Chris Cooper), acid-tongued Aunt March (Meryl Streep) and Mr. Dashwood, the terse-talking newspaper publisher. 
	Told on a broken timeline, “Little Women” forgoes the linear structure of the novel to jump back-and-forth in time. It’s a clever device that takes some getting used to—at first it’s not immediately obvious the story is skipping around — but ultimately it provides insightful perspective on the characters and why they make the decisions they do. Gerwig has fiddled with the story’s collision of feminism, romance and family dynamics just enough to amplify its resonance for a modern audience. Playing around with a well loved and well-worn classic is risky, but Gerwig pulls it off with panache, aided by an extraordinary cast that brings the material to vivid life. 
	Chalamet, reteaming with Ronan and Gerwig after the success of “Lady Bird,” drips charisma as the foppish and devoted friend/love interest Laurie. He’s equal parts awkward and arrogant, putting a new spin on a character that has been played by everyone from Peter Lawford to Christian Bale. 
	Streep and Letts drop in for some comic relief but it is the chemistry between the sisters that is the film’s biggest success. Previous adaptations have tilted in Jo’s favor, giving her the most screen time and the juiciest character arc. Gerwig recalibrates, allowing each of the sisters to shine. The story still revolves around Jo’s interactions with the women, but in this adaptation, each of them push the story forward. Watson brings kindness and empathy to Meg. In Scanlen’s hands, Beth is sweetly realistic about her lot in life. Ronan and Pugh leave the largest impression, imprinting the tale with their steeliness, humour and humanity. 
	“Little Women” is a rarity. It’s an adaptation of an often told tale that manages a rethink while still holding true to what made the source material so beloved. 
	“1917” is a simple story of duty wrapped up in a high gloss technological package that delivers a vividly immersive look at life during wartime. 
	Designed to look like one continuous shot, the action in “1917” begins in the trenches of Northern France with two men, Lance Corporals Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), assigned a dangerous mission. With telephone lines down, their general (Colin Firth) dispatches the pair travel through No Man’s Land on foot to the front lines. If they can make it past the barbed wire, booby traps and German snipers, they are to deliver the message that the Germans have set a trap, enticing the unwitting British to attack. “If you fail, it will be a massacre,"" the general says. If successful, Schofield and Blake could save 1,600 lives, including Blake’s Lieutenant brother (Richard Madden). But first they must travel through nearly 13 kilometres of the most dangerous territory on earth. 
	It’s easy to feel that “1917” is a gimmick film. In the opening scenes I found the continuous, one shot nature of the filmmaking a distraction. I kept wondering, “How is Sam Mendes doing this?” or looking for clever, surreptitious edits. It took me out of the story but once accustomed to the gliding camerawork by the legendary Roger Deakins I began to focus on the story’s tale of bravery and resilience, and less on the trickery that created it. 
	The horrors of war are duly represented—there’s barbed wire, rotting corpses litter the landscape and a bombed-out town is nothing more than the skeletons of buildings—but “1917” doesn’t focus on that. This is a contemplative story of a mission and the men who sacrifice their own safety for the greater good. It highlights the ever-present danger of attack but it is the character’s emotional journey that makes for a compelling story. Blake wants to stop his brother from walking into a trap, while Schofield is driven by a sense of duty. Both men are working for the collective, which in our era of the individual, is a potent reminder of the importance of the cooperative effort. 
	“1917” is a beautifully grim movie. Death lurks around every corner and the success of Blake and Schofield’s mission is never assured. Hope is a remote, elusive concept in the theatre of war but Mendes weaves in enough humanity—the relationship between the soldiers, a scene with a French mother and her daughter—to give viewers a window into the horrors of war. 
	When we first meet Walter McMillian (Jamie Foxx), known to friends and family as Johnny D, he’s in his element, in the woods chopping down a tree as part of his pulping business. The calm and serenity of his life is soon uprooted by Alabama lawman Sheriff Tate (Michael Harding). What at first seems to be a routine stop takes a turn when Tate snarls, “You wanna make a break for it? ‘Cuz after what you did I’m happy to end this now.” 
	Those words kick off the action in “Just Mercy,” a based on life events legal drama starring Foxx and Michael B. Jordan. Johnny D is sent to death row even before he is tried and convicted of the murder of an 18-year-old local girl. “You don’t know what it’s like down here when you are guilty since you were born,” he says. 
	After languishing in a tiny cell near the prison’s “death room” for several years, Johnny D is visited by Harvard-trained civil rights defense attorney Bryan Stevenson (Jordan). The former church pianist is an idealistic young man, new to the profession but fuelled by a passion to fight injustice. “I wanted to become a lawyer to help people,” he says. Moving to Monroeville, Alabama—where Harper Lee wrote “To Kill a Mockingbird”—he sets up the Equal Justice Initiative with the aid of Eva Ansley (Brie Larson) to focus on undoing wrongs. 
	It’s a daunting task. On his first visit to the prison he is illegally strip searched by a leering guard on his way in. Worse, the community sees him as someone who wants to put convicted killers back on the street. He deals with death threats, witness intimidation and racism but the biggest hurdle comes down to one cold, hard fact: “You know how many people been freed from Alabama death row?” asks Johnny D. “None.” 
	Working against the odds, Stevenson begins a campaign to expose the corruption that landed his innocent client in jail. “Whatever you did your life is still meaningful,” he says, “And I’m going to do everything I can to stop them from taking it.” 
	“Just Mercy” does a good job in setting up the obstacles Stevenson encounters on his search for the truth. The film could be criticized for director Destin Daniel Cretton’s traditional, linear approach but the entrenched racism and systemic resistance to change Stevenson deals with are undeniably powerful indictments of a legal system that favours the establishment over everyone else. 
	The core cast brings the tale of injustice to life with formidable but understated performances. Jordan and Foxx keep the theatrics to a minimum. As Stevenson, Jordan is all business, driven by personal passion but bound by his professional attitude. Foxx is stoic, a man who has lost all hope. When his case takes a turn, the change in his body language is a subtle reminder that his attitude has shifted. 
	Equally as strong are the supporting players. As death row inmate Herbert Richardson, Rob Morgan brings vulnerability to the kind of character who is so often portrayed as a one-dimensional stereotype. 
	The film’s showiest performance comes from Tim Blake Nelson as a man tormented by his role in Johnny D’s wrongful conviction. His face contorted and scarred, he gives the character an arc within his relatively short time on screen. 
	It has been a long time — possible forever — since anyone has written that one of the year’s best movies stars Adam Sandler. No, it’s not a rerelease of “Billy Madison” or the director’s cut of “Happy Gilmore;” it’s a crime thriller from acclaimed indie filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie called “Uncut Gems.” 
	Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a walking, talking raw nerve. As a New York City jeweller, his life is a mess. His business is failing, he owes everyone in town money and yet he can't stop gambling. He’s planning on leaving his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) for new girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) — who also works in his store — and the damn security door in his shop is on the fritz. 
	Like all hustlers he’s always looking for the big score and thinks he may have found it in, of all places, the History Channel. After watching a documentary about mining in Africa he hatches a plan to get his hands on a rare Ethiopian black opal he figures is worth more than a million dollars. He has a buyer in NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (playing himself), who thinks the gem has mystical powers that will help his game, but Howard needs more cash upfront than the basketball player is willing to pay. 
	Watching “Uncut Gems” is an exhausting experience. Howard’s jittery personality is brought to vibrant life by Sandler. For two hours he’s like a N.Y.C. traffic jam come to life, complete with the shouting and jostling. He’s the architect of his own misfortune, constantly in motion, bringing chaos to all situations. With handheld cameras the Safdies capture Howard’s gloriously scuzzy behavior, luxuriating in the character’s foibles. 
	Sandler has breathed this air before — most notably in “Punch Drunk Love” — but he’s rarely been this compelling. He brings his natural likability to the role but layers it with Howard’s neurosis, frustration, conniving and even joy. It’s a remarkable performance powered by jet fuel, and by the time Sandler is locked in the trunk of his own car, naked, you'll be drawn into the dirty little world of “Uncut Gems."" 
	The animated “Spies in Disguise” features the voice of one of the biggest movie stars in the world and one of the strangest premises we have seen all year. 
	Back at HQ after a daring mission, he’s drinking from his '#1 Spy' mug when he’s taken into custody for stealing a secret weapon called the M9 Assassin. He claims he’s innocent, that a villain named Robot Hand (Ben Mendelsohn) stole his identity and made off the weapon. One daring escape later Sterling sets off to prove his innocence. 
	Trouble is, he’s easy to find so he tracks down the one person who can help him, MIT grad Walter (Tom Holland), a junior inventor in the agency’s Gadget Lab. “I need to disappear,” he tells the youngster. 
	Walter obliges, sharing his biodynamic concealment potion with Sterling. The spy disappears but not in the way he hoped. Instead of becoming invisible, the next best (or worst, depending on how you look at it) thing happens. He turns into a pigeon. “There are pigeons in every major city,” Walter says. “It’s the perfect disguise.” 
	It’s a good way of going incognito perhaps but not practical in the hunt of Robot Hand. “I’ll come with you and show you all the advantages of being a pigeon,"" Walter says. ""It might even make you a better spy.” Together they set off to find Robot Hand as Marcy (Rashida Jones), the agency’s head of security, tries to find and arrest them. 
	Featuring Pierce-Brosnan-era-007-style action and gadgets, “Spies in Disguise” is frenetic, family friendly James Bond Lite. Directors Nick Bruno and Troy Quane keep the pace brisk, pausing only to emphasize a gag. The movie works best not when it’s in action but when Sterling is adjusting to life as a pigeon. As his latent avian instincts come on strong, for instance, he finds he can’t resist eating garbage on the road. It’s goofy fun that is more interesting than Sterling’s human form, which is all swagger. 
	The script, by Brad Copeland and Lloyd Taylor, also mines a considerable amount of humour from the odd pairing of Sterling and Walter. Sterling is a shoot first and ask questions later kind of spy while Walter favours unusual methods, like disarming the baddies with wild, glittery cat videos because, well, everyone loves a cat video. “You can do more by bringing people together than blowing them up,” he says. 
	“Spies in Disguise” is buoyant enough to entertain the eye but the messages for kids about the benefits of being part of a flock and celebrating one's differences are expertly woven throughout. 
	“The Song of Names,” based on Norman Lebrecht's award-winning novel, is a story of two people sent off in different directions searching for lost family members. 
	The action begins in 1951. On the eve of his debut concert performance for a packed house of kings and queens, Polish musical prodigy Dovidl Rapoport (Jonah Hauer-King) disappears. His adopted English family, including his brother Martin (Gerran Howell) is distraught. They first met Dovidl as a nine-year-old who, when he moved in with them to study violin, declared, “If I snore I snore in tune. I am a musician!” The family kept him safe from the Nazi threat and groomed him for greatness. 
	Cut to 1986. Martin, now played by Tim Roth, is adjudicating a music competition in Northern England when a contestant uses a technique that seems very familiar. Thoughts of his former brother have consumed Martin and this simple but unique method of rosining the bow sets Martin on a journey that will take him to Poland and finally New York City. His quest has one simple purpose: to find out why Dovidl (played as an adult by Clive Owen) left. 
	As a celebration of music, “The Song of Names” is terrific. Legendary composer Howard Shore has written new music for the film, including the “Song of Names,” a moving recitation of the names of all the Jewish people killed at Treblinka. It’s a powerful moment, solemn and heartrending, that is the film’s absolute high point. More playful is a violin duel in a London air raid shelter between the nine-year-old Dovidl and a teenage rival. Both scenes display the power of music to move us, whether it is to tears or to applause. 
	It’s the detective story that falls short. Clues that have eluded Martin for decades suddenly become obvious and the journey seems less like a mystery and more like a game of “Where’s Waldo.” More intrigue may have brought with it more emotional weight.",POSITIVE
"Jan 28, 2021"," Sometimes you watch a movie and you feel like you just haven’t seen the same thing everyone else saw. For me, Uncut Gems, from directors Benny and Josh Safdie, is just such a movie, because the roar of praise behind it baffles me. Adam Sandler plays Howard, a jewelry dealer who owes a whole lot of money after a whole lot of bad gambling decisions. He’s the kind of guy who never stops talking, hoping to overwhelm everyone else into buying whatever he’s selling. But instead of having the gift of ultimate persuasion, he has the gift of talking himself into the worst possible decision at all times. As this is Adam Sandler, I should stress this is a dramatic role, and he’s very good, though maybe not the revelation some people have made him out to be. But he’s distressingly believable as an addict, an adrenaline junkie, and a man with supreme — and supremely misguided — confidence.  The movie itself mirrors Howard’s character, all jittery intensity, never letting up for a second. The Safdies obviously have the talent to be upper-tier filmmakers, but they have the sensibilities of college students talking about what would look really cool as they sit on the couch under their Mean Streets poster. It’s incredibly frustrating, because they’re often right—what’s supposed to look cool does look cool, what’s supposed to be grimy is terribly grimy, and they can certainly create unrelenting tension… although I did have trouble distinguishing between tension and my own irritation. Because everything they do is empty and artificial. There’s nothing real about what’s going on. No one behaves like actual people, they only do what the Safdies want them to do as they play their own game, and nothing — nothing — exists organically; it’s all entirely manufactured to fulfill the Safdies’ ends. None of it’s there because it ought to be, it’s there because they want it to be. There is one exceptional 20-minute sequence near the end, though it hardly justifies what comes before, and certainly not what comes after, with the most hacky ending possible, a move that was edgy in 1994 but already tired and used up by 1995. Still, the Safdies have their supporters—in fact, it seems that’s everyone but me, given Uncut Gems’ reception. But it feels like they’ve just pulled off a giant hustle, which frankly isn’t a terribly respectful thing to say of my fellow critics, so maybe it’s best if I just say that this movie is very, definitely, not for me.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 7, 2020"," t the Welo Mine in Ethiopia in 2010, a miner’s leg injury causes an upheaval amongst the workers and supervisors. At the same time, deep underground, an unfazed duo discover a massive gem. Two years later, in New York City, 48-year-old Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) undergoes a colonoscopy at the hospital. When he returns to his jewelry shop, KMH, he’s shaken down by thugs sent by a man trying to collect $100,000 owed for some bad debts. A short time later, Kevin Garnett and his crew turn up at the showroom, forcing Howard to divert plenty of attention to the high-rolling basketball star. But it doesn’t stop the jeweler from ignoring his disgruntled employees in favor of unwrapping a million-dollar opal, which Garnett negotiates to keep overnight – as a lucky charm for the game that evening. Of course, Howard snags the NBA pro’s championship ring as collateral, which he pawns for some quick cash to place hasty bets. Ratner’s life is hectic and spontaneous, which is instantly annoying. The supporting characters mostly appear as if non-actors (and, indeed, many of them are recognizable celebrities), lending a certain realism to the nonstop ordeal of Howard’s compulsive gambling, general financial recklessness, and negligent parenting. But the majority of the dialogue crowds the audio, overlaps to the point of unintelligibility, or gets lost in heated arguments. And, most aggravating of all, is the soundtrack music, which is so overbearing, unfitting, and disruptive that character lines are frequently difficult to make out. And the mood of the music is always wrong; when it should be tenser, it’s melodic or choral, and when it should be calmer, it’s frenzied and dark. The score is perhaps the most upsetting piece of an incredibly pitiful jumble of poor editing decisions, even if they’re collectively orchestrated to create a specific vibe. “I don’t need your watch; it probably fell off a truck anyway.” The characters are morally bankrupt, which makes it difficult to care about any of their various plights or overall wellbeing – or even their ultimate outcomes. Nevertheless, Sandler’s performance is amusing, if only because it’s a grand departure from his previous, memorable, comedic turns. But the novelty of it wears thin pretty quickly. “I happen to be a litigious individual.” Plus, he’s surrounded by despicable people and, as the story requires, continual ugliness, particularly when gangsters attempt to recover lost, lent funds. From a shady partner (LaKeith Stanfield) to a mistress/employee (Julia Fox) to an understandably bitter wife (Idina Menzel) to uncaring children, Howard has alienated everyone in his life who should be on his side, leaving him utterly alone with the violent consequences of dealing with underworld brutes (and being unwaveringly selfish). It doesn’t help that the bulk of the script is cursing, physical fighting, verbal sparring, and all sorts of disordered episodes of untethered tempers – unfolding at loud, screechy volumes. There’s nothing even remotely pleasant or absorbing about this tumultuous yarn, and certainly nothing that Sandler’s uncommon persona can save; it’s an overlong, uninteresting, badly arranged (the overly contrived scenarios are astounding), extremely disagreeable downfall that only gets worse as it goes along. At least there’s a curious irony in the opening scene transition, which moves from the mesmerizing colors of the precious stone to the slimy caverns of Howard’s large intestine.

"Nov 27, 2020"," The predictions for this year’s London Film Festival (LFF) surprise film was always between two highly anticipated pictures, Parasite and Uncut Gems. Even with the tease of “who likes musicals? Who likes cats?” didn’t convince the crowd as the Safdie Brothers, introduced their latest effort to the crowd. For those lucky enough to grab tickets, they were in for a stormy ride as we are whisked into the world of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). While previous surprise films at LFF have been crowd pleasers (Lady Bird) or tamer affairs (Green Book), Uncut Gems was a massive shock to the system for those expecting a relaxing evening. In New York, Howard Ratner has the opportunity of a lifetime to make some serious money after a rare opal arrives on his desk. Basketball player Kevin Garnett, becomes obsessed with the gem and the supposed power it possesses, Howard finds himself in debt and on the run. Couple that with his addiction to gambling and Howard is in for a tough week as he struggles to juggle money issues, a fractured relationship with his children, and a mistress with a taste for the high life. This probably all sounds overwhelming to experience and I won’t lie that it really does throw you in at the deep end and doesn’t care if you sink or swim. Even as the opening credits roll, we are immersed in  Howard’s world as people constantly talk over each other and conversations are cut short or just left hanging. It works perfectly as an introduction to his frantic life and serves as a reintroduction to the energy that the Safdie Brothers achieved so fantastically in their previous film, Good Time. The similarity between the two films leads are clear to see as they both live in the moment, hoping to make a break but always being pulled back in by the lure of a bigger win. This film feels like a constant adrenaline shot to the system, as though every couple minutes when you feel yourself relaxing, another spanner is thrown into the works, throwing off the audiences and Howard’s equilibrium.  While many have lauded the performance of Sandler as his best since Punch-Drunk Love, this film relies more heavily on his comedic charisma than it does the romantic-comedy skills he had perfected with Drew Barrymore in the 90’s. Every moment on screen feels fresh and he owns the role with the experience of an actor really enjoying himself. As a character, Howard is constantly looking for success but with a bad temperament that should make him unattractive but somehow his charismatic aura draws people into trusting him. Had he somehow not been so likable and trustworthy despite his clearly questionable morals, this film could have collapsed in on itself. Aside from Sandler, the stand out performance is from Kevin Garnett playing himself, joining other sporting stars Michael Jordan and LeBron James in making the move from the Basketball court to the cinema screen. He plays off some incredible actors and holds his own while also making us eager to see if he’ll do more acting work in the future. Continuing the links to their previous film, Good Time, composer Daniel Lopatin joins again to provide some incredible atmosphere that really helps dial up the intensity of the film. While the dialogue comes thick and fast, it’s the score that really captures Howard’s energy so perfectly. At times running at a low hum as though bubbling just underneath the surface waiting to explode into an orchestra of synths. The Safide Brothers seem to understand the power that sound has on the cinematic experience and have been able to exploit that perfectly here. Uncut Gems is the perfect example of a Marmite film. You could watch this and experience levels of anxiety that are unparalleled and have an awful time. However, if you can keep your cool, and take the journey one nail biting experience at a time then you may find yourself having a glorious time. If my cinema experience is anything to go by, the audience will be cheering on a Basketball match that happened seven years ago with the intensity of a world cup final shoot-out. Somehow I am getting excited for rebounds and tip-offs despite never watching a match before outside of Space Jam. If a movie is able to draw me so deeply into a world that I feel completely enthralled in it’s conclusion  then it’s doing something incredibly special. ",POSITIVE
"Nov 27, 2020"," A charismatic New York City jeweler always on the lookout for the next big score, makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides, in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win. Directors Benny and Josh Safdie are an acquired taste.  Their gritty, in-your-face, manic approach overshadowed their first three films, undercutting their hard-edged stories.  However, they tone things down just enough to allow this tale of small-time hustler Howard Ratner, brilliantly played by Adam Sandler, to resonate. As their anti-hero’s schemes come tumbling down around him, the directors’ already intrusive camera bores in even further on Sandler who fills the screen with a sense of misguided bravado and frantic desperation that’s a revelation.  Not for all tastes, this is a daring piece of cinema that signals a new and welcome direction for Sandler.",POSITIVE
"Oct 27, 2020"," Despite having thousands of movies to choose from, a sleek navigation system, and a hit-or-miss algorithm, it can be difficult to decide what to watch on Netflix. That is why we're bringing you our list of 70 0f the best movies currently streaming on Netflix India (as of October 2020). Go forth and binge watch. Anurag Kashyap's modern-day reimagining of Devdas is less of a breath of fresh air and more of a welcome punch to the gut. Whether it's the depiction of complex female characters or how it blends music with narrative (it was composer Amit Trivedi's breakout film), Dev D is less about plot and more about exploring the mind of its angst-fuelled protagonist. Amy Adams plays a professor of comparative linguistics tasked with communicating with aliens in Denis Villeneuve challenging sci-fi tale. Arrival expertly uses conventions of the genre to explore free-will, experiences and memory, in a film that is as personal as it is relatable. The heartfelt and deeply empathetic Telugu film from debut director Venkatesh Maha spans four love stories across religion, caste, and generation, and features a charming cast mostly made up of non-actors. Spike Lee tells the extraordinary true story of a black police officer who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in 1972 with the assistance of a Jewish cop Flip Zimmerman in film which is as playful as it is deeply political. Oh and also Adam Driver and John David Washington. Enough said. Martin Scorsese's sprawling gangster epic remains one of the finest testaments to Netflix's commitment to putting talent first and making the kinds of films the studio system has turned its back on. It's Pesci, Pacino, De Niro and a fantastic 3 hours. Noah Baumbach's heart-wrenching relationship drama, starring an excellent Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, follows the undoing of a married couple, exploring the joy, love and searing pain of a relationship like few before him have. Vishal Bhardwaj concluded his much-discussed Shakespeare trilogy with this modern-day adaptation of Hamlet, and transposed the story to Kashmir, masterfully using the Bard's work to explore insurgency and conflict. Throw in a career-best performance from Shahid Kapoor and our case is made. Two legendary British thespians in a movie largely limited to their lengthy conversations becomes so much more in Fernando Meirelles' The Two Popes. Anthony Hopkins plays doubt-ridden, conservative Pope Benedict XVI and Jonathan Pryce is Cardinal Bergoglio, his reluctant and progressive successor resulting in a masterclass in drama. A heart-warming and deeply empathetic fantasy feature from the one and only Bong Joon-ho, Okja uses the story of a girl and her best friend, a large, weird animal called Okja to making powerful statements about the modern meat industry. Nadine Labaki's Lebanese drama, based on a 12-year-old boy who decides to sue his parents for ""child neglect,"" is the highest-grossing Middle-Eastern film of all time. More importantly, it's a stone-cold masterpiece.  Alfonso Cuaron's most personal film is also his finest – an affectionate portrait of his childhood as well as modern Mexico City through the eyes of a young nanny.  Ildiko Enyedi's Hungarian love story – between a CFO of a slaughterhouse and his new health inspector – is the definitive portrait of introversion, loneliness, outcasts and kindred souls.  Despite its laundry list of accomplishments, SS Rajamouli's game-changing, industry-altering two-part epic remains, above all, just great storytelling which proves Indian cinema can, in fact, be just as imaginative and expansive as its Western counterpart. The best of Aaron Sorkin's razor-sharp writing and David Fincher's visual style come together to bring to life the riveting true story of the birth of Facebook in a film that resonates now more than ever. Petra Costa's Oscar-winning documentary, stalking the rise and fall of two Brazilian Presidents during the country's socio-political crisis, is unflinchingly personal, and challenges our perception of ""political"" filmmaking.  One of the finest Brazilian films of the last decade, Aquarius is a snapshot of bureaucratically backward Brazil through the story of a woman – the last resident of a building – who refuses to sell her apartment to a construction company.  The funny, thought-provoking film has become arguably one of the most revisited and discussed films of our time. Jim Carrey plays Truman Burbank, a seemingly everyday man who slowly learns his life is the subject of a live 24-hour reality show. The ahead-of-its-time film spoke volumes about everything from politics to the rampant rise of reality TV. Alejandro G. Iñárritu's Best Picture-winning drama stars Michael Keaton as a washed-up superhero actor who struggles to revive his career with a Broadway play. The entire film was shot to resemble a single long take and its cast included Edward Norton, Zach Galifianakis, and Emma Stone. Need we say more? Arguably one of the best coming-of-age high school comedies in recent years, The Edge Of Seventeen stars Hailee Steinfeld as an awkward teenager navigating the trials of high school. Her heartfelt friendship with teacher-mentor, played by Woody Harrelson, alone makes this a wonderful watch. Tamara Jenkins paints a deeply personal portrait of a couple, played by Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti, struggling with infertility, navigating the world of adoption and assisted reproduction. In his award-winning Kannada-language film set in a remote village, Raam Reddy masterfully examines three generations of men in the aftermath of their 101-year-old patriarch's demise. Made with a cast of non-actors, Thithi was a community a film – one where the community it's set in becomes the film, where the reel and real blend together in the most wonderful ways. Vidya Balan stars in what remains one of the best thrillers Hindi cinema has ever produced. Sujoy Ghosh's film follows the mysteries surrounding a pregnant woman who travels from London to Kolkata in search for her missing husband. Angelina Jolie's Khmer-language war-period thriller is an empathetic, informative and unerringly elegant dissection of Cambodia's bloody history through the eyes of a 5-year-old girl trained to be a child soldier.  A Sundance Grand Jury winner, Elite Zexer's first film – an intense look at Israel's patriarchal pillars through the experiences of a Bedouin mother and daughter – is driven by two of the finest performances in recent memory. A Caméra d'Or winner, Houda Benyamina's scintillating urban thriller – about two young female buddies hustling the streets of Paris – is a triumph of filmmaking, social commentary and doomed girlhood.  This is based on the true story of Oakland Athletics and manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt), who attempt to build a competitive team by relying solely on statistical analysis, with help from a Yale graduate (Jonah Hill). Throw in the great Philip Seymour Hoffman and what you get is a deeply empathetic sports drama that's more about people than it is about the number crunching. A charming take on the changing dynamics of modern relationships, the quirky Marathi comedy drama stars Amey Wagh and Mithila Palkar as a young couple who decide to part ways, something their parents can't seem to come to terms with. Filmmaker Adam McKay's pivot from comedy legend to high drama director began with his scathing exploration of the 2008 global financial crisis. Led by an electric ensemble including Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt, The Big Short is as informative, insightful and innovative as it is drop dead entertaining. No modern Bollywood film has encapsulated that feeling of a much-needed breather of fresh air, or resonated as widely and deeply with Indians everywhere quite like Queen. The flagbearer of 'New Bollywood' follows the story of Rani, a girl who decides to tour Europe on her own resulting in a journey of self discovery, independence and freedom. At a time when 'high school movie' is a light, fluffy flick, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower showed it could be infinitely more. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a delicate film which captures the pain, fragility, love and joy of being young like few before it have. A story of five thirty-something friends who struggle to find a place in Mumbai to play football becomes so much more in the hands of debut director Milind Dhaimade who uses a feel-good light-hearted tale to explore gender, generational and religious divides along the way. In this hopeful comedy-drama about how family can both connect and divide us, Noah Baumbach brought his distinctive voice to a story about a dysfunctional siblings and their dictatorial father brought to life by stellar performances from Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Allison Janney and Dustin Hoffman. Pankaj Tripathi is peak Pankaj Tripathi in this brooding Delhi-based crime drama about a kidnapping gone wrong. Gurgaon is a brutal, unforgiving film about the circle of violence and remains an achievement in how it creates mood and feeling to amplify its narrative. Knock Down The House follows the campaign of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the now famed AOC, and three other female candidates as they run for Congress in 2018 resulting in one of the greatest political underdog stories seen on screen. One of Netflix's first animation projects is a humorous, heart-warming take on the Santa Claus story with a rich new style of animation that feels as comfortable as it is refreshing. Director Lijo Jose Pellissery's electric gangster story remains one of the most talked about Indian films of recent years. With a cast of 86 fresh faces, he tells his tale of a bunch of outlaws on the streets of Angamaly with dizzying style. That now-iconic 11-minute long shot alone is worth the experience. Among the many recent gems of Malayalam cinema, Sudani From Nigeria is a beautiful story of friendship between a Nigerian football player stranded in a small Kerala village and its residents who take care of him. It's a heartfelt story that argues that the things that bind us far outweigh those that divide. With his Marathi film about an 11-year old boy who must adapt to a new life after his father's death, Avinash Arun's directorial debut succeeds in telling a simple story bursting with heart. Aside from being one of the best films of 2020 so far, Alice Wu's film took a step away from the typical glossy high school movie and gave us characters who felt real and familiar. For a film to be made about love in this day and age that has something new to say is nothing short of a triumph. Under the guise of a post-apocalyptic horror film, actor-turned-director John Krasinski offered a deeply emotional meditation on family and parenting that was as riveting as it was affecting. The film that stirred up a generation, the Aamir Khan-led ensemble drama about getting the youth to take a stand and call out social injustice, has never been more relevant. The Safdie brothers had funnyman Adam Sandler showcase his remarkable dramatic chops in this frantic, hyper stressful tale of a New York City jeweller trying to outrun the debt collectors after him. A tender father-son story about a man who visits his 84-year-old father who is slowly slipping into dementia, this Bengali film examines the shifting values across generations and the process of coming to terms with loss. Sanjay Mishra is exemplary in Rajat Kapoor's philosophical film about a man who decides not to believe everything that he's told until he sees it with his own eyes. A simple enough premise which becomes a layered, emotional story about family and modern society. Arguably the finest Hindi film of the decade, Ritesh Batra's film made urban isolation feel almost aspirational in his story revolving around Saajan (Irrfan Khan), a reclusive middle-aged office-goer, and Ila (Nimrat Kaur), a disenchanted housewife whose odd encounter with Saajan through a case of mixed up lunchboxes blossoms into a soulful romance. Sriram Raghavan's celebrated thriller involves an allegedly blind pianist, a Shakespearean vamp, an ageing actor and blind rabbits. A delicious cocktail of black humour, suspense and drama, Andhadhun will keep you guessing till the very end. And beyond. Even 10 years on, Vikramaditya Motwane's directorial debut about a sensitive boy and his abusive father remains a piece of storytelling so tender and personal, that none of the artists associated with it have touched these dizzying heights since. Dibakar Banerjee's anthology of three stories linked by a threadbare connection bursts through the clutter, both, in terms of its brutal narrative as well as its distinct CCTV-footage visual style. Nearly 20 years after its release, Ashutosh Gowariker's Lagaan remains just as memorable. One of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog tales, a powerful script, impressive execution and an unforgettable soundtrack from A R Rahman made it one of three Indian films to bag an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film.  Manmohan Desai's iconic film about three brothers who are separated in childhood and raised in different faiths has a galaxy of stars, a terrific performance by Amitabh Bachchan and Kader Khan's infinitely quotable dialogue. What more could you want? Thiagarajan Kumararaja's delectable hotchpotch of dark comedy, drama and sheer unpredictability offers a unique cinematic experience that is fun, philosophical, zany and moving all at once. Halitha Shameem's charming Tamil anthology is a breath of fresh air. Following four stories, the film shows the beginning of connections, leaving the conclusion to our own interpretation.  Allu Arjun's energetic action drama about a child separated from his parents at birth, only to be reunited later, offers a spree of entertainment with comedy, drama, and action. Filmmaking duo Raj & DK's ability to weave a story that is at once surprising, disturbing and witty never fails to impress. Nowhere did that feel as raw and distinct as it did in Shor In The City, a film about about three interconnected stories in the maximum city. In a year where the biggest hit was the loud, gaudy Himmatwala, Shekhar Kapoor's Masoom, with its realistic textures, nuanced performances and insightful narrative, seems to have sprung from some other filmmaking universe. The film follows a married man discovering that he has a son with another woman. Asim Abbasi's bold family drama made many sit up and take notice of Pakistani cinema once again. Cake examines dysfunction, masculinity and miscommunication while making you  laugh, smile and cry along the way.  In a politically-motivated bid to close a high profile robbery case, policemen in Andhra Pradesh torture four innocent Tamil daily wage earners to confess to a theft they haven't committed. The National Award-winning crime thriller directed by Vetrimaaran explores police brutality like few before it. ",POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2020"," It's practically undeniable that Uncut Gems features the best performance of Adam Sandler's career, though if you're unfamiliar with Sandler's meatier dramatic work this may sound like a not particularly lofty statement. If you are familiar with Sandler's meatier dramatic work, and you should be, then you may be shaking your head in disbelief that Sandler's turn as jeweler and fuck-up extraordinaire Howard Ratner in the Safdie Brothers' Uncut Gems could rival Sandler's acclaimed work in such films as P.T. Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love, The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), the criminally under-appreciated Reign Over Me, and to a lesser degree Funny People.  By now, the Safdie brothers have pretty much become known as mindfuck filmmakers. This may never be more evident than it is in the opening scene of Uncut Gems, a scene that opens in the diamond minefields of Northern Ethiopia and ends in the asshole of an asshole we're going to get to know over the next two hours and fifteen minutes - Howard Ratner, whose colonoscopy is a minefield all its own and more than likely symbolic of more than a few things that we're going to get to know about Howard and his life over the next couple hours.  This colonoscopy is pretty much the highlight of the couple of days we're going to spend with Howard, whose life sort of resembles that of a hamster constantly running on the hamster wheel but never actually getting anywhere.  The Safdies have crafted one of the year's most tense, unnerving and unforgettable thrillers, a film both funny and frenzied and so at times relentlessly exhausting that you may find yourself working up a cinematic sweat just watching it.  Howard runs the kind of shoe-box sized jewelry shop that glitters amidst the dust of New York City's Diamond District, a district defined by non-stop chaos that perfectly fits with the non-stop chaos that defines Howard's life. Howard likes to pretend that he has hopes of escaping the chaos, a hope that exists in the form of a huge gem discovered in the film's opening scene and a gem that finds its way into Howard's hands. He plans to auction it off within the week to the expected tune of a million bucks. It's a million bucks that will allow Howard to solve his financial woes and escape the clutches of the goons who monitor his every move.  Uncut Gems introduces us quickly to Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), Howard's right-hand and connection to A-list hip-hop stars and professional athletes like Kevin Garnett, playing himself here to tremendous effect, who are attracted to the kind of bling that Howard offers. Howard, and ya gotta' love him even when you hate him can't help but flash his prized gem and before long he's loaned it to Garnett for just one night when Garnett becomes convinced it'll help him get back to the NBA finals.  For the next couple of hours, Howard deals with the fallout of these bad choices including his crumbling marriage to his wife (Idina Menzel) and his potentially cheating mistress (Julia Fox). whose affair is reported to be with hip-hop star The Weeknd, also playing himself here.  Howard is an addict, his gambling addiction only skimming the surface of a life that is entirely built upon one more deal, one more trade, one more risky choice, and a complete inability to not double down on even the worst choice. Howard is his own worst enemy, even worse than the goons that trail him including a sociopathic one frighteningly portrayed by Eric Bogosian. Howard thinks he wants to quit, but he can't and even if he gets ahead he's going to get behind again because he's addicted to the adrenaline rush that comes with risky behavior and poor choices. The fact that the Safdie brothers, working from a script they created with regular collaborator Ronald Bronstein, have turned all of this into a nailbiting thriller that works is nothing short of miraculous and it has given Sandler his best role to date.  Sandler has most definitely risen to the occasion. The casting of Sandler is a stroke of genius, just as was true with the casting of Robert Pattinson in the Safdie's last film, Good Time. An inherently likable actor, Sandler never loses us despite being a nearly non-stop asshole for the film's entire running time who can't shut the fuck up long enough to figure out that he's the problem and not everyone around him. It's easily one of the year's best performances and deserves to be recognized with an Oscar nomination at the bare minimum. Sandler finds the quiet, pitch-black laughs dancing between the screams and the shouts here, while he also manages to infuse Howard with an abundance of pain and rage and pity and self-destruction.  Idina Menzel gives a tremendous performance as Dinah, Howard's long-suffering wife who radiates a repressed hatred for her husband but still seems to, rather begrudgingly, care about him. Julia Fox is also tremendous as Julia, while Lakeith Stanfield proves once again to one of the best of the up-and-comers. Both Garnett and The Weeknd shine when they get their turns, while Eric Bogosian is just plain frightening.  D.P. Darius Khondji, replacing usual Safdie cinematographer Sean Price Williams, captures all the dusty glitter of a tainted New York City while practically bathing the film in the seductive, washed-out colors of an addiction-tinged world that promises so much and delivers so little. Daniel Lopatin's original score starts off brilliantly and never pulls back.  Uncut Gems isn't likely a film for everyone. It's a relentless film, the kind of film that is so immersive that you practically shake the dust off of you as you leave the theater and call your counselor on the way out the door. For those willing to be immersed, however, Uncut Gems is one of the year's best cinematic experiences and is worth it if only to watch Adam Sandler as you've never seen him before and as you'll want to see him again. You may tell yourself that you've seen a better film in 2019 than Uncut Gems, but with relentless authenticity and exhausting exhilaration, you most certainly won't have another cinematic experience that even compares to this risk-taking, intuitive work of wonder. ",POSITIVE
"Jul 29, 2020"," Adam Sandler has played straight drama before, but nothing will prepare you for this adrenaline-pumped film that feels like a plunge into a vat of battery acid. It’s a wild ride made all the more disorienting by the presence of Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner, a jittery, jaundiced Manhattan jeweler who is always on the lookout for a quick buck, be it through bad bets or shady business deals. Up to his neck in gambling debt, one step ahead of the bookie’s goons, Howard miraculously finds himself in possession of an opal-embedded rock that, he’s convinced, will enable him to finally pay everyone off. Of course, it’s not that easy. Nor is it easy to sit through Uncut Gems, a movie that explodes from the gate with reckless abandon, then barrels through its course offering little in the way of surprise or reflection before running into the brick wall we’ve never doubted for a moment stood at the finish line. With no reward at the end, we’re left only to marvel at Sandler’s bravura performance — and that’s not quite enough to make the whole ordeal worthwhile.  Film directors Benny and Josh Safdie are New York brothers with a distinctively New York vision — make that New York circa 1975, when you had to keep your head on a swivel, street hustlers scurried along the littered sidewalks like hopped-up rats, and only an idiot ventured down a dark Manhattan block after hours.  Everybody hates Howard, including his wife — heck, including his girlfriend — but like a black hole, he draws everyone in his unfortunate vicinity toward his self-destructive event horizon. Like them, within minutes of making Howard’s acquaintance we want to punch him right in the kisser, but we’re also held in a masochistic kind of thrall. Besides, we want to stick around to see what awful choice he’ll make next.  Strangely, the role of perpetual loser Howard seems a natural shift for Sandler, who’s made his career playing irresponsible boobs. He doesn’t disappear into the role of Howard so much as channel the anger and cluelessness of Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison into a chasm of nervous energy. ",NEUTRAL
"Jul 8, 2020"," Para el tiempo que tardó en llegar “Diamantes en bruto” a México, seguramente ya habrás escuchado todo sobre la brillante actuación de Adam Sandler y cómo estuvo muy cerca de obtener una nominación al Oscar. Pues, estoy aquí para confirmar que esos no son cuentos chinos y efectivamente, “Diamantes en bruto” es todo lo prometido y más: los hermanos Safdie (Josh y Benny) dirigieron un filme impresionante. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) es un joyero judío neoyorquino que invierte exorbitantes cantidades de dinero en una piedra preciosa para luego venderla a un alto costo; pero al hacerlo se queda endeudado y se ve en la necesidad de recurrir a un montón de negocios engañosos para intentar obtener de vuelta su inversión. Esto involucra empeños, gritos, persecuciones, apuestas y hasta el involucramiento del famoso basquetbolista Kevin Garnett.  “Diamantes en bruto” es un torbellino que te arrastra, revuelve tu cerebro y constantemente te intenta inducir ataques de ansiedad. Imagina esto: un montón de personas alteradas metidas en un pequeño cuarto gritando de todo durante varios minutos mientras el timbre de una puerta suena constantemente, todo acompañado de una edición furiosa que desafía tu paciencia. Esa es una de muchas escenas en donde no hay control y los hermanos Safdie te abofetean sin cesar… y lo mejor, es que la historia es excelente. Después de ver “Diamantes en bruto” vas a necesitar unos minutos para componerte. Tal vez quieras correr un rato o gritar mucho para desahogar los sentimientos acumulados causados por el implacable ritmo y la desesperante historia. Esto puede sonar negativo pero no lo es. Sufres viendo “Diamantes en bruto” porque las decisiones de su protagonista son terribles y exasperantes, pero… también son fascinantes. ¿Ahora qué? ¿Cuáles serán las consecuencias de sus actos? ¿Podrá salirse del problema en el que está metido? El filme es absolutamente absorbente y nunca deja de ser entretenido.  Estamos ante la redención de Adam Sandler. El hombre es la pieza perfecta para lo que los Safides intentan hacer. Su personaje Howard es un hombre adicto a las apuestas, insistente y ambicioso cuya boca nunca se detiene. Hay un sentido de urgencia en todo lo que hace, pues está corriendo por aquí y gritando por allá, siempre con la presión del tiempo y el dinero encima. Sandler es deslumbrante en su ejecución: te hipnotiza con tsunamis de halagos y mentiras, y controla todo cuadro de la película, obligándote a ver cada segundo de ella aunque ya estés harto de tanto barullo. Sin duda alguna, es la mejor actuación de su carrera y una que, en un año menos competitivo, le hubiera dado un Oscar. El reparto del filme no se queda atrás: tenemos a Julia Fox, Lakeith Steinfeld y el legendario Kevin Garnett, todos haciendo impecable trabajo dándole un aura de autenticidad al desarrollo de la trama. Además de la tremenda edición de Robert Bronstein y Benny Safdie, el score musical de Daniel Lopatin ejerce enorme autoridad en la historia. Parece un lenguaje propio cuyos sintetizadores y sonidos insólitos buscan aumentar tu angustia. El volumen sube y baja, a veces es contemplativo y otras veces es caótico. La música es como una válvula que se mueve constantemente para generar sentimientos como felicidad, histeria o frustración: cada nota mueve algo en tu cabeza. “Diamantes en bruto” es extraordinaria. Una película que asalta tus sentidos, te absorbe y no te suelta. Es como ver un agotador, ruidoso y emocionante partido de ping pong cuyo final parece nunca llegar y en donde cada movida te acerca a un ataque de pánico. Y tal vez ya te quieres ir, tal vez estás exhausto… pero no puedes dejar de verlo. Los hermanos Sadfie dirigieron una película que es como nada que hayas visto antes,  que es siempre entretenida y te sorprende en cada esquina. Señor Adam Sandler, queremos ver más de esto, por favor.",POSITIVE

"Jun 27, 2020"," It must be tough to be Adam Sandler. To once have been on top of it all, one of the biggest box office draws in the world, only to crash so hard that he’s gone from respected comedian to comedians’ joke. He has attempted image changes in the past, though they’ve usually included some form of comedy. In his latest, Uncut Gems, we get full dramatic Adam. Howard Ratner (Sandler) is a jeweler in New York City’s Diamond District. He’s the kind of guy who’s always “on” and seems to know everyone. He has a wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), three kids and is having and affair with one of his employees, Julia (newcomer Julia Fox). He’s also the kind of guy who, despite appearances from the façade he’s meticulously created, is a karmic loser. Life is consistently kicking him in the crotch. He’s perpetually in debt to someone, which then means he’s hustling someone else for money in a vicious circle. His luck is about to finally change, though. He’s come into possession of an uncut opal, and he has arranged to have it sold at an upcoming auction. Yet, because he’s Howard, the path to riches is paved with potholes, not the least of which is Arno (Eric Bogosian), to whom Howard owes a lot of money and whose goons hassle him on a nearly hourly basis. Uncut Gems is a near masterpiece of filmmaking, both in story and style. Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, from a script co-written by Ronald Bronstein, it fully cements their storytelling prowess and is a worthy follow-up to their brilliant Good Time. In fact, this film does for Adam Sandler what that previous film did for Robert Pattinson: Provides the lead actor with a role so extremely different to what an audience is used to seeing from them it succeeds in breaking them free of their typecasting. Sandler knocks it out of the park, here. He has to, since almost every frame of film is focused on him. Between his performance and the Safdie’s writing, Howard becomes that rare character who’s both utterly despicable yet someone you can’t help caring about, much in the same vein of Pattinson’s Connie Nikas in Good Time. Sandler’s manic performance and the Safdie’s equally frenzied directing style also keeps everything moving at a good clip. Though it carries a 135-minute runtime, it feels more like 90 to 100, at the most. There isn’t a moment of drag, and only a few seconds here and there to catch your breath. Even the rather subdued auction scene is fraught with underlying tension. Then there’s the score by Daniel Lopatin. It surfs the wave between the sound of Michael Mann’s 1980’s output and music you’d swear was pulled directly from the anime classic Akira. While that might strike you as an odd combination, it beautifully mirrors the film’s carefully crafted tone. If you had said to me at the beginning of 2019 that I would be praising an Adam Sandler movie, even going so far as to say he wholly deserves an Oscar nod, I would have laughed so hard I’d probably continue to laugh every time I saw you for the next week. Yet, here we are, and Uncut Gems is exactly that Sandler movie. If he can figure out how to keep this momentum going, continue finding scripts this strong and provocative, he might have a chance of shedding the stigma of being a joke and maybe earn the same kind of acting respect we gave those such as Robin Williams.

"Jun 22, 2020"," Reader, are you there? I hope so, because it's time once again for that annual ritual of almost instant regret and months-long second thoughts, the public declaration of my choices for the best films of the year. Since The Commercial Appeal no longer publishes movie reviews on a regular basis, the selection was particularly tough this year. I had a lot of catching up to do, having failed to see as many movies in theaters as I usually do. Of course, the concept of ""movies in theaters"" is not as essential as it once was. Several of this year's most significant films — including a couple that made my list — were produced primarily for streaming services, notably Netflix. Even so, I'm sticking with my longtime methodology of restricting my choices to new movies that screened publicly in Memphis for the first time during the past year, with an allowance for older movies that came to a theater here when they received their first significant U.S. theatrical distribution. This tradition eliminates, for example, the much-lauded ""Marriage Story,"" which remained exclusive to Netflix in Memphis; but it enables me to consider the many one-time screenings of new films hosted by Indie Memphis and Crosstown Arts.  This also means that most people in Memphis had an opportunity to see the movies on these lists—  even if most people didn't take that opportunity.  1. “The Irishman”: “Russell went to church. Then he went to the prison hospital. And then he went to the graveyard.” Change the name and remove the word “prison” and that summary of a life from Martin Scorsese’s 209-minute career monument could apply to many, maybe even most of us, even if we never torched a laundry or hijacked sides of beef or punched bullet holes in a gangster named “Crazy Joe” in a clam bar in New York. The very definition of a late-period masterwork, this reckoning with a quarter-century of American corruption and damnation touches upon historical and fanciful milestones as if they were the stations of an inverted cross; the sacraments are here, too, including unholy parodies of Holy Communion, when gangsters Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci break bread and dip it into wine. Produced for Netflix, the movie screened Dec. 2 at the Paradiso, in an event hosted by Indie Memphis. 2. “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood”: Something new in Quentin Tarantino’s wish-fulfillment rewrites of history, this — unlike “Inglourious Basterds” and “Django Unchained,” which visited righteous wrath on Nazis and slavers — is a preemptive revenge fantasy, enacting savage man-vs.-woman violence upon Manson Family members who have yet to kill anyone (“You don’t belong here,” Leonardo DiCaprio’s Rick Dalton tells them, just because he doesn’t want scruffy hippies in a noisy car in his exclusive neighborhood). And yet, until the ugly climax (mitigated if not exactly redeemed by a poignant coda), this is the writer-director’s most tender and transcendent film, filled with yearning for a minutely specific-yet-fairy tale past; brimming with swoon-worthy performances by DiCaprio, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie (she's an angelic Sharon Tate, presented — per Tarantino — as a “walking, talking sunbeam”); and fashioned from one indelible scene (cowboy actor Dalton meets his 8-year-old co-star), shot (check out Brad’s suede moccasin boots) and shout-out (Bruce Lee, Steve McQueen) after another, after another, after another ... 3. “Uncut Gems”: An essential if nerve-frying experience, Benny and Josh Safdie’s fourth feature film is both microscopic and macrocosmic in its vision; it’s as if one Safdie is peering through a jeweler’s loupe — or a colonoscopy camera — while the other wields the Hubble telescope, as the writer-directors (in collaboration with writer Ronald Bronstein) place the pathetic scheming of a tornadic New York gem dealer and gambling addict (Adam Sandler) within (a) an intensely specific ethnic and cultural milieu; (b) the web of a world economy fueled by misery and injury, from Ethiopia to Manhattan; and (c) the shock wave of history, from the Big Bang to the dinosaurs to the NBA Eastern Conference semifinals, Celtics vs. Sixers, Game 7, 2012. Dizzying in its overlapping talk-talk-talk, incessant ambient din and translucent set design (glass is everywhere), the movie seems to radiate energy, heat, light and pressure — it crushes scenes into diamonds. 4. “Honeyland”: Short-listed for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and Best International Feature (a nomination in both categories would be unprecedented), this eye-opener about a honey-harvesting elderly woman in rural Macedonia is (yes) sweet, but (yes again) it stings, as the beekeeper’s kindness, gentleness and smart stewardship of her resources prove irrelevant and unpersuasive to her disruptive new neighbors, whose short-term-profit exploitation of the hive becomes a small-scale representation of rapacious, environmentally destructive capitalism. Like many of the best documentary filmmakers, directors Tamara Kotevska and Ljubomir Stefanov provide intimate access to a place and a way of life that otherwise would be entirely unknown to most viewers; the beekeeper, Hatidze Muratova, may be the year’s most unforgettable and awe-inspiring hero. 5. “Babylon”: Unreleased in the U.S. until this year (Indie Memphis screened it in April at the Studio on the Square), director Franco Rosso’s rediscovered 1980 masterpiece is set among the Black immigrant and working-class communities of London, where “sound system” disc jockeys chase the freshest buds and beats from Jamaica while police officers and racists literally beat the doors down. The central M.C. is played by Brinsley Forde, leader of the British reggae band, Aswad; his musical presence is just one element of authenticity in a movie that never strikes a false note. 6. “Parasite”: A fiendishly original and ingeniously constructed (physically and narratively) comic suspense thriller, South Korean director Bong Joon-ho’s latest genre/art crossover is a wonder, even if its well-intentioned political message is muddled by its plot mechanics (the outcome, like the economy, is rigged). Song Kang-ho stars as the patriarch of a struggling working-class family that insinuates itself, through deception, into a wealthy household seemingly walled-off from the consequences of inequity; the shocking discovery of a desperate and even less visible literal underclass is evidence that water (to use a euphemism) rolls downhill, as Bong demonstrates in the movie’s most vivid set piece, when a downpour that is picturesque at the level of the mansion becomes a flood by the time it washes into the poor family’s vulnerable neighborhood. 7. “Peterloo”: Glorious words (“calumniated”) and painstaking pictures recreate the events leading to the horrendous “Peterloo massacre” of 1819, in which British soldiers charged into a crowd of thousands that had gathered in Manchester to demand fairer representation in Parliament. Overlooked by audiences and undervalued by most critics, this is another top-tier effort from writer-director Mike Leigh, who presents history as breaking news and as augury: The age of “gilded reptiles” — to borrow a labor agitator’s characterization of the 19th-century ruling class — is with us still. 8. “The Souvenir”: Set in the 1980s, writer-director Joanna Hogg’s quasi-autobiographical coming-of-age remembrance stars Honor Swinton Byrne (daughter of Tilda Swinton, who is in the movie) as an intellectual but naive film school student whose relationship with an urbane but somewhat louche and mysterious Foreign Office staffer (Tom Burke) is a source of inspiration and disillusion. Literary in tone and cinematic in expression, the film is entirely singular: It embraces sincerity and bravery and rejects cynicism, even as it recognizes the appeal of dissolute privilege. 9. “Portrait of a Lady on Fire”: A young artist (Noémie Merlant) in 18th-century France travels to an isolated island estate to create a portrait in secret of a reluctant bride (Adèle Haenel) in an arranged marriage in writer-director Céline Sciamma’s formally rigorous yet uncanny drama, which recognizes the hope and futility that accompany the attempt to capture another person’s essence, in love or in art. In a lengthy central section, Sciamma imagines a community minus not just men but hierarchy or authority: Is it a surprise that it’s almost a Utopia? 10. “The Dead Don’t Die”: Inspired by George A. Romero (whose “Living Dead” films were social commentaries with real bite) and Mad magazine (complete with the fourth-wall-breaking asides that characterized that satirical publication’s movie spoofs), writer-director Jim Jarmusch’s latest is a beautiful complement to his previous horror-genre gloss, “Only Lovers Left Alive”: If that 2013 vampire movie was Jarmusch looking into the mirror (the bloodsuckers were stylish hipsters with a fondness for urban decay and Neil Young), the new zombie movie is Jarmusch looking out the window — and being distressed by what he sees (the climate crisis, for one thing). “This isn’t going to end well,” drawls Adam Driver’s deputy sheriff, who repeats the comedic line until it becomes unfunny — until we realize it’s not a punchline but a prophecy. 1. ""Apollo 11"": Produced on a budget of billions (if one includes the cost of the U.S. space program up to 1969), this documentary by director-editor Todd Douglas Miller uses archival footage (including stunning 70mm film never before seen by the public) to present the first mission to the moon — from launch to landing to return — as both nail-biting adventure and visionary achievement; captured with face-melting proximity, the closeup shots of the propellant blasts of the Saturn V rocket during lift-off represent the year's most astonishing ""special effects."" Although Miller lets the footage speak for itself, the film — which opened March 1 at the Paradiso IMAX and has been playing for months now in a condensed version at the Pink Palace — inevitably mourns the passing of an era when U.S. lawmakers valued science and could suspend partisan politics to transform bold imagination into heroic realization. 2. “Burning”: Adapting a short story by Haruki Murakami, South Korea’s Lee Chang-dong delivers what may be cinema’s most elliptical serial killer drama, about an unsettled young would-be author (Yoo Ah-in) who finds himself inside a not-quite love story turned could-be mystery that is as vague and uncertain as the novel he tells people he plans to write. 3. “Chained for Life”: A pretty actress (Jess Weixler) in a low-budget horror movie is paired with an actor recruited for his real-life disfigurement (Adam Pearson, who has neurofibromatosis) in this tricky balancing act from writer-director Aaron Schimberg. Assured and unexpectedly chipper (thanks largely to Pearson’s wry presence), the film works as both an affectionate movie-industry comedy (with references to Franju and “Freaks”) and as a provocative inquiry into the parameters of onscreen “representation.” 4. “Dolemite Is My Name”: Working from a script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski that harks back to the duo’s “Ed Wood,” Craig Brewer’s Netflix-hosted return to feature filmmaking is a spiritual sequel of sorts to “Hustle & Flow” and a hilarious homage to the Memphis director’s own family-and-friends filmmaking roots. Eddie Murphy is ideally cast as real-life “adult” party record and “blaxploitation” pioneer Rudy Ray Moore, an ambitious but frustrated man determined to defy the naysayers and express himself through his do-it-yourself art. 5. “Hail, Satan?”: Directed by Penny Lane (yes, that’s her real name), the year’s funniest documentary chronicles the media-savvy provocations and occasional humbug devil-worship rituals of The Satanic Temple, a yokel-baiting, First Amendment-fortifying tax-exempt “church” that challenges government displays of the Ten Commandments with petitions to erect its own tributes to the goat-headed demon, Baphomet. Rarely has so-called blasphemy seemed like so much prankish fun. 6. “Hyenas”: Making its overdue Memphis public debut after being restored and made available in the U.S. by Metrograph Pictures, Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mambéty’s 1992 comic masterpiece about a wealthy elderly woman who plunges her hometown African village into chaos is blisteringly definite in its targets (the persistence of colonialism as consumerism, especially) but universal in its consideration of human existence as both tragedy and farce (the movie is adapted from a Swedish play). Another of the year’s best movies, “Atlantics,” a political supernatural drama that screened during the Indie Memphis Film Festival, was directed by Mambéty’s niece, Mati Diop. 7. “Little Women”: Apparently undaunted by the challenge of crafting the sixth screen version of Louisa May Alcott's beloved novel since movies began to talk, Greta Gerwig delivers a work that is at once light and sturdy, charming and strong, classic and timely; under the writer-director's assured supervision, the ensemble cast — the title sisters are Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh and Eliza Scanlen — and complex fractured chronology never become confusing. Characters this warm, admirable and persuasive haven't been seen onscreen since last year's Mr. Rogers documentary; when ""Marmee"" (Laura Dern) tells her daughters ""Be good to each other,"" you may find yourself resolving to do just that. 8. ""Midsommar”: A daylight horror movie motivated by heroine Florence Pugh’s inconsolable anguish and the “mansplaining” and passive-aggressive gaslighting of her dubious boyfriend, writer-director Ari Aster’s flower-draped folk-horror followup to “Hereditary” was not everybody’s cup of menstrual blood tea. I loved it. 9. “Transit”: In updating the story from World War II to a mysteriously Fascist-occupied present-day Paris, German director Christian Petzold transforms Anna Segher's 1942 novel into both a Philip K. Dick-esque ""alternate history"" thriller and a Kafkaesque neo-""Casablanca."" Either way, it's an on-point commentary on the fragility of Western-style freedom. 10. “Us”: Writer-director Jordan Peele’s followup to the epochal “Get Out” is as messy and overstuffed as its predecessor was direct and elegant. Still, it’s a nonstop kick, bristling with milestone achievements (Lupita Nyong’o’s fierce dual performance); potent jokes and scares; and Peele's confidence that the terrorism of American racism can be clarifyingly refracted through the prism of “Twilight Zone”-esque horror-fantasy — even if Peele’s key inspiration this time wasn’t Rod Serling but Pogo Possum, who said: “We have met the enemy and he is us.” (“Us” equals “U.S.,” you know.) Also worth seeing: ""Amazing Grace,"" ""Avengers: Endgame,"" ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" ""Best Before Death,"" ""Booksmart,"" ""Border,"" ""Brightburn,"" ""Child's Play,"" ""Clemency,"" ""Climax,"" ""Crawl,"" ""Dragged Across Concrete,"" ""The Farewell,"" ""Ford v Ferrari,"" ""Frankie,"" ""Harriet,"" ""Her Smell,"" ""The Hottest August,"" ""In Fabric,"" ""Jojo Rabbit,"" ""Knives Out,"" ""The Lighthouse,"" ""Little Joe,"" ""Ma,"" ""Memphis '69,"" ""Midnight in Paris,"" ""Missing Link,"" ""Monos,"" ""The Nightingale,"" ""Pain and Glory,"" ""Raise Hell: The Life and Times of Molly Ivins,"" ""Richard Jewell,"" ""Roll Red Roll,"" ""Ruben Brandt, Collector,"" ""Shazam!,"" ""Shoplifters,"" ""Synonyms,"" ""Toy Story 4,"" ""Varda by Agnès,"" and many more.",POSITIVE

With only a handful of festival screenings around the world, and a very limited cinema release in the US, this gripping tale of redemption can now be found on Netflix. Adam Sandler demonstrates without question that he has some serious acting abilities. It's well worth watching this on the biggest screen possible with your best audio equipment. It's intense filmmaking that starts slow and messy and accelerates to a mesmerising climax. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a New York jewellery-store owner who is struggling to deal with business and family pressures: problems all of his own doing. A chronic gambler, Ratner has huge debts and owes money to a number of people, including his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian). But, as a charismatic schemer who seems to know his way around the city, Ratner has a few deals in place and thinks that one of these will generate the cash needed to pay everyone off. His main hope rests on a rare black opal (the uncut gem) that he's secured illegally from Ethiopia and which he intends to sell for a small fortune. His plans get complicated when celebrity basketball player Kevin Garnett (playing himself) visits the shop and decides he must borrow the gem as good luck for that night's game. Bullied by his assistant Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) who brings the high-net-worth celebs to the store, Ratner finally agrees, taking a valuable ring from Garnett as collateral. Convinced that Garnett's team - the Boston Celtics - will win, Ratner also places a big bet on the game: one that he can't afford to lose. On the personal side of life, Ratner's situation is just as badly stitched together. Although he is planning a divorce, he's still living at home with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and two children, but he's paying for an expensive apartment for his mistress (and employee) Julia (Julia Fox), who is devoted and difficult. Ratner spends his days juggling demands, smoothtalking the devil at the door and wheeling and dealing. Although it's all a desperate strategy to keep everyone happy while waiting for the big pay-off, he relishes the challenge, thriving off the dangerous energy. Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie (Heaven Knows What, Good Time), who co-wrote with Ronald Bronstein, this is one of those rare films that manages both to build a riveting plotline and let us watch a complex, compromised character in action. Yes, Ratner is part rat, cunning and clever, but he's also a rough diamond, driven by a naive optimism that makes him likeable despite the motor-mouth, the bling and the ridiculous promises that you know are only going to make everything worse. The Safdie brothers design this as relentless, immersive storytelling, backgrounded by an incessant buzz: from the endless jostling noise of the streets and clubs of New York to the vulgar décor of Ratner's love-pad. Supporting Sandler's dazzling performance are excellent turns from Fox and Menzell, playing female characters fully aware of both the charms and dangers of this man. Stanfield also does great work playing Ratner's assistant, slowly revealing the limits of tolerance for those in Ratner's orbit. If ever there was a film that demonstrated the way members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences vote, this is it. Despite a swag of critics' awards and near universal praise - in particular for Sandler - the movie didn't receive a single Oscar nomination. Sandler's reputation as a comedian of dubious taste is almost certainly the reason. But set aside any doubts or prejudice you may have about Sandler's talent here: he is riveting and remarkable.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2020"," Everything might be unspeakably terrible, but at least there’s one good thing coming on the horizon: Uncut Gems will be on Netflix before the end of May. If you’ve found yourself endlessly scrolling through your streaming apps lately, May will bring a fresh batch of options—including Crazy Rich Asians, Rocketman, The Graduate, Jaws, and new comedy specials from Jerry Seinfeld and Hannah Gadsby. New series including Steve Carell vehicle Space Force and Ryan Murphy’s Hollywood are set to premiere this month as well, along with new seasons of critically-acclaimed shows like Ramy and Homecoming. Hopefully, these will keep you busy enough to avoid doomscrolling for at least a couple hours. As someone who spent most of her high school years wearing black, bathing in eyeliner, and avoiding the sun, I might have been squarely in the middle of Underworld’s target demo when these films came out. That said, the Kate Beckinsale-in-leather vehicle Underworld and its second sequel, Rise of the Lycans—starring an insanely committed Michael Sheen—are both pure popcorn fun. Evolution, the first sequel in the series, will be available as well, but you can and should just skip it. (Available May 1.) More Frank Oz! The main feature of this director’s cut is that famously nihilistic alternate ending—which might land a little strangely right now, given, well, everything. But if that’s your fancy, it’ll be available May 1.",POSITIVE
"May 1, 2020"," Josh and Benny Safdie have spent a decade making scrappy, low-budget movies on the streets of New York; freewheeling, urban stories, in other words, that hark back to an earlier era of filmmaking. In their last film, Good Time, Robert Pattinson played Connie Nikas – a bright, resourceful petty crook who falls into a night-long churn of violence and exploitation, redeemed only by the unshakeable love he holds for his brother Nick. A good reference point might have been Scorsese’s underrated and arguably more commercial work from the ’80s – After Hours, in particular. Uncut Gems, the Safdie brothers’ latest, is a kinetic, midtown Manhattan tale, a jewellery-district drama that features a towering performance from Adam Sandler – continuing the run of good work that includes Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a brash jewellery salesman whose life is constantly on the edge. Always in debt, Ratner is one of life’s schemers, and he comes to believe that the answer to his prayers is a valuable stone, illegally imported from Ethiopia. When a famous basketball player, Kevin Garnett (playing himself), becomes obsessed with it, Ratner figures his ship is finally coming in – but fate has other plans for him. For those turned off by Sandler’s usual comedy shtick, the good news is that there’s very little of it here. His company might get a little wearing, but that’s partly the point, and the Safdies offset his abrasive nature with some sympathetic supporting turns, notably from Julia Fox as Ratner’s mistress. We are rocketed through Ratner’s world – a place of permanently raised voices, propulsive camera work and blaring noise – accompanied by a pulsing score from Daniel Lopatin, AKA Oneohtrix Point Never. Aside from Scorsese, the Safdies channel other masters of New York’s discomfort zone, including Paul Schrader, Abel Ferrara and James Toback. The Safdies more than deserve to sit at the same table.",POSITIVE
"Apr 30, 2020"," “I heard you had your swimming pool resurfaced,” is one of the more benign threats you’d expect to hear in a thriller, but coming from Arno (Eric Bogosian), it drips with menace. You see, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) owes Arno a great deal of money, and Howard has been using that money he borrowed to line bets up all over NYC. Howard thinks he can talk his way through this with Arno, but he’s not really talking to Arno, he’s dealing with first-class psychopath Phil (Keith William Richards). Like any gambling addict, Howard’s optimism knows no bounds, but he likely didn’t see himself getting stripped and stuffed into the back of his wife’s SUV. Howard plays off every new calamity with an assurance that everything will be fine, and it’s easy to believe him. Uncut Gems counts on that belief to put the collective nerves of viewers in a vice and ratchet them up for two straight hours. The Safdie brothers – whose last film, Good Time, redefined Robert Pattinson for a lot of moviegoers – are prepared to show you a new side of Adam Sandler. Sandler’s man-child persona has been folded into something more self-destructive this time around. Howard Ratner exudes chaos merely through being. An addict relies on highs, but there aren’t any highs for Howard, just an ever-continuing series of lows that put him deeper in debt. Yet that six-figure debt never stops Howard from itching for his next payday. Howard is a jeweler in Manhattan’s famed Diamond District, ergo he doesn’t need to be doing any of this. He has a luxurious home, a family, a mistress (Julia Fox), and her own apartment to boot; he just wants more. Howard’s latest score involves a black opal from northern Ethiopia that catches the eye of NBA All-Star Kevin Garnett. Howard’s already promised the opal to an auctioneer, but he agrees to loan the stone to Garnett in exchange for his championship ring. This isn’t an altruistic move, however, Howard senses something in the way that Garnett eyes the opal and Howard wants to make money off whatever that look means. Using Garnett’s ring as collateral, he puts a massive bet down to clear his books for good. As this is a Safdie brothers movie, you can imagine things won’t prove so easy for Howard. The immersion into this deeply anxious film starts with Howard, passed out on a doctor’s table, receiving a colonoscopy. To truly pass that discomfort on to the audience, cinematographer Darius Khondji does a deep zoom through Howard’s colon. That is the only time of rest as Howard perpetually moves forward, stumbling through one transaction with other people’s money into another, dodging Arno and his associates (somewhat) successfully, and trying to keep his head above water. The pulse of the score by Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) becomes indistinguishable from Howard’s racing heartbeat. It’s an unrelenting presence that feels like waiting two hours to exhale. Adam Sandler knows how to turn it up when called on (Punch Drunk Love, Funny People) and his performance as Howard Ratner is not only one of the best roles of 2019, but maybe his entire career. Equally, con-artist and schmuck, Howard deludes himself just as much as the people relying on him to pay them back. When a broken and beaten Howard yells “I’m exhausted,” it’s perhaps the only true thing he says. The man is so comically self-absorbed that he hardly notices the high-risk situations he puts his family and Julia (Julia Fox, in a breakout performance) into. What makes Sandler’s time as Howard so endlessly watchable is because his unpredictability often leads to disaster. Though it’s tempting to regard as a one-man show, Uncut Gems surrounds Sandler with an outstanding supporting cast. In addition to Eric Bogosian, Julia Fox, and Keith William Richards, the film adds LaKeith Stanfield, Judd Hirsch, and a scene-stealing Kevin Garnett to bounce against Sandler. Of course, as entertaining and comedic as Uncut Gems can be, the Safdies are always ready to catch that laugh in the back of your throat. Just as Darius Khondji began the film with a spiraling journey through the black opal, he ends the film just the same. A cold reminder that we come from the same Earth as that opal and return to it in a blink. With that transition, the Safdies reveal their fatalistic worldview: Howard isn’t unique in his eternal quest for more everything.

"Mar 29, 2020"," As people restrict their movements, maintain “social distancing” and follow official advice to stay at home as much as possible, most places are either deserted or have been declared no-go areas. Pubs, clubs, casinos, restaurants, malls, gyms and theatres have been hit hard. The Melbourne International Comedy Festival, which was meant to start next week, was cancelled, as was the Grand Prix. Whole economies have been hobbled. Even Bondi beach has been shut. The effect the virus has had on cinema has been devastating. The Sydney Film Festival is off and cinemas across the US, UK, China, Italy, Spain, India and Poland have closed. In the US, the closures are expected to last two months. Locally, Palace cinemas has shut its screens nationwide while the major chains forge on, limiting patrons per theatre to less than 100 – as per the PM’s edict about the cap on public gatherings – and spacing people apart. Needless to say, ticket sales have nose-dived, with many major films, such as the new Vin Diesel film Bloodshot, playing to audiences of one.  One wonders why all cinemas don’t simply shut down until people are more relaxed. After all, should you find yourself alone in a huge cinema but for one other person and half-way through the film you hear that person sneezing, how’s that going to affect your movie-going experience? Heaps of major films have been postponed: Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway; Black Widow; the 007 film No Time to Die; Mulan; The New Mutants; Antlers; A Quiet Place 2; Fast & Furious 9 (till April next year!); and Minions 3. So, what to do with all that spare time stuck at home? Finish writing that novel? Learn to knit? Finally get around to clearing out that spare room? Nay. People, quite sensibly, are turning to their TVs and computers for salvation from bordem. There is, of course, free-to-air programming, your DVD collection and all the delightful offerings on YouTube. As well as paid streaming outlets, don’t forget the free online services run by the TV networks, which offer a huge range of archived programs for you to catch up with and binge on. For films though, special mention must be made of  SBS on Demand, a splendidly constructed website that is a true blessing in our online landscape. Its library contains a wealth of films –  from classics to contemporary, niche to mainstream, quirky to queer – so please check it out. In response to the virus some studios have brought the digital release of some major titles forward so people can enjoy them now while they endure self-isolation, rather than waiting the three months it usually takes for a theatrical release to hit the home market via disk and stream. Since the advent of powerful streaming platforms such as iTunes, Netflix, Stan, Amazon Prime, Google Play, Apple TV and so on, the sanctity of that 90-day grace period – during which exhibitors try to sell up every possible cinema ticket before the film is made available in the home market – has been under siege. We’ve recently seen major films such as The Irishman, The True History of the Kelly Gang, The King, Marriage Story and The Report get short theatrical runs – a pre-requisite for award eligibility – before hitting the stream. They ran at independent cinemas because the big players don’t embrace the idea of shortening the theatrical window. In the US people will get early access to Frozen 2 (also available here on Disney+), The Invisible Man, Emma, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, The Hunt, Just Mercy, The Way Back, the Pixar film Onward (opening early in cinemas here on 26 March – provided cinemas are still open), Birds of Prey, Bloodshot (in cinemas here), The Gentlemen and Sonic the Hedgehog. In a major virus-related move, Trolls World Tour will come out in the US on digital platforms on 10 April as well as in cinemas – if they have re-opened, that is. Otherwise, the stream will have the running, disregarding the usual 90-day window that all other delayed films will apparently observe. So it seems the Coronavirus might indirectly add heat to the tussle over the longevity of the traditional three-month window, a tussle that was already getting hot.",POSITIVE
"Mar 9, 2020"," There are all kinds of people in this world… rich people, poor people, good people, religious people, selfish people, altruistic people, and downright douchebags.  You know the type.  The kind of person who uses anyone and everyone to get what they want and doesn't care who they step on along the way.  Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler; The Wedding Singer) is exactly that kind of guy.  A New York, Jewish jeweler who owes a ton of money to a loan shark looking to collect. Ratner scams and schemes his way through New York in the award-winning film, Uncut Gems. However, Garnett doesn't want to return the stone believing it is his good luck charm and it turns out Ratner's loan shark took the money from the bookie so Ratner has no money to buy the ring back.  Things get worse from there.  Ratner and his girlfriend break up, his wife hates him, the uncut gems only appraise at auction for less than $200,000 when he thought it would be at least a million, etc.  Every time Ratner seems to get a break something else bad happens.  It isn't like Ratner doesn't deserve it though.  However, just as he is on the verge of losing it all, Ratner wins big but sadly never gets the chance to truly enjoy it. I tend to like Sandler in his more serious roles, though many of those characters seem to have a good guy, romantic slant to them.  While Sandler is excellent in this film, I find nothing redeemable about Ratner and, much like Pacino's Tony Montana in Scarface, I can't root for him.   Every move he makes aggravates me and whenever he opens his mouth I cringe. Of course, I think he got what he deserved in the end.  His lovely ladies, Julia De Fiore (Julia Fox in her feature film debut) and Dinah Ratner (Idina Menzel; Frozen),  are both terrific and compliment him perfectly. The Blu-ray is presented with the standard 1080p resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  While the details are crisp, at some points the film has an overall underlying grittiness/graininess to it to give the feeling of a somewhat ""underworld"" of New York City, Jewelers and loan sharks.  The DST-HD Master Audio 5.1  is excellent and really shows off the eclectic soundtrack.  The dialogue is sharp while the ambient noise isn't particularly overpowering.  The combo pack offers the Digital HD and a DVD along with the Blu- ray disc but the only ""true"" extra is called ""Money on the Street: The Making of Uncut Gems. Filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie bought a quality product to audiences this past year and Sandler shines and the wholly unlikeable Ratner, but the film has flaws.  The story has several moving parts and none of them seem to make up one cohesive unit and Ratner is not a character one can sympathize with or empathize with so I found him annoying and pitiful rather than the charismatic charmer the Safdie brothers wanted him to be.  The story is decent and Sandler does a great job, but I just didn't care what happened to the central character and that is the big problem.

"Feb 28, 2020"," The first type enjoys his broad comedies – the crasser the better, the more Kevin James and Rob Schneider on screen, the better. If Sandler is off in some sunny location, goofing around with his mates and calls it a movie, woo!  The second type of Sandler fan is extremely selective. They think his early stand-up work is good, they might even cop to liking Happy Gilmore (but maybe wouldn’t if they saw it again). But what they really like is when Sandler is in other people’s movies. The point is, for the second type of Sandler fans, when he’s in other people’s movies, and when he has little involvement in the creative development of those films, that’s when he’s at his best. Which makes the Sandler you see in Uncut Gems a marriage of the two camps. It’s a very Sandler performance – intense, loud and big. But in a movie that is so far from a typical Sandler movie.  Uncut Gems is directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, indie filmmakers with a track record for challenging thrillers. The Safdies don’t make easy-to-watch, forgettable comedies, they make high-stakes, madcap films that captivate and linger. Much like the hunk of rock at the centre of Uncut Gems, a thousand-plus carat of black opal which hypnotises, described by Sandler’s character Howard as “you can see the whole universe in there”. Howard is a dealer in Manhattan’s diamond district, a man with a lot of complications in his life, all of which he’s brought on himself. A problem gambler being chased by his loan shark’s (Eric Bogosian) goons, he’s also juggling between a wife (Idina Menzel) who’s about to leave him and a girlfriend (Julia Fox) whose apartment he’s paying for. When the black opal, wrapped inside a fish, shows up, Howard is mesmerised by its beauty but also by how it’s going to get him out of debt. So, he probably shouldn’t agree, however reluctantly, to lend it out to legendary NBA player Kevin Garnett (playing himself) for good luck. Your first type of Sandler fan might be surprised by the kind of movie they’ve signed up to with Uncut Gems, but hopefully they’ll stick around because the propulsive thrills are so visceral, it’s an experience they won’t find in Grown Ups 3 (god help us if that actually eventuates).  Uncut Gems is a sensational movie – from the first minute to the end, it won’t let up. There is no reprieve from the tension that’s been stretched so tight you’re certain it’s going to snap. But the Safdies are so adept at maintaining that anxiety, you have to just sit back and marvel. Sandler is on excellent form and gives a performance with so much momentum, chaos and power, it once again begs why he doesn’t do this kind of thing more often.  Anchored around that key Sandler performance, Uncut Gems works on every level – the dazzling script, the cinematography with its gritty aesthetic and the production design which drops the audience into this gauche world. But the thing that elevates it above all else is the frenetic energy that infuses every scene, yet calibrated so perfectly so that it stays, barely, on the right side of frustrating. There’s nothing more thrilling than that. The film Civil War is an anxiety-inducing experience from start to finish – but one scene in particular will likely stay with you long after the credits roll. A major film up for five awards at this year’s Oscars has been accused of “line by line” plagiarism in an explosive new report published on the eve of the event.",POSITIVE
"Feb 18, 2020"," A self-destructive gambling addict who is swiftly spiralling out of control is the subject of the Safdie brothers’ latest film, Uncut Gems. The film is an intense crime thriller driven by a terrific performance by Adam Sandler. The protagonist is Howard Ratner (Sandler), a jeweller who is addicted to sports gambling and owes money to his loan shark brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian).  His personal life isn’t faring any better than his financial situation. His estranged wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), wants a divorce, although the couple are keeping up appearances for the sake of their children. And, he is shacking up with his mistress and jewellery store employee, Julia (Julia Fox). Howard hopes his luck will turn with the auction and sale of a rare gemstone he has acquired and that Basketball player Kevin Garnett (playing himself) has taken a shine to. But things, as you would expect, don’t go quite according to plan. With each misstep, he falls deeper into trouble. Every time the debt collectors come calling, he finds himself in hot water(s). You spend nearly two hours squirming at Howard’s actions, choices, and dishonesties, wondering if he will manage to redeem himself or will instead fall prey to his own vices.  But even though he is a thoroughly unlikable character, you eventually get to the point where you still find yourself hoping he wins. If for no other reason, than to give the viewer a respite from the constant stress of the situation. Between the frenetic pacing, non-stop chattering and yelling, and chaotic predicament, the tension rarely lets up. That might be why watching Uncut Gems isn’t exactly an enjoyable experience – it’s stressful and hectic and anxiety-provoking. But, that doesn’t take away from the fact that the Safdies have created a drama that is downright fascinating. The setting, too, is interesting, although perhaps delving a little deeper into the harsh backdrop might have made it even more intriguing.  A slight misstep also emerges in the form of the intrusive soundtrack which, it’s fairly obvious, was meant to be visceral, but is instead often jarring, especially in the initial sequence. The credit for carrying the film goes entirely to Adam Sandler who is surprisingly terrific in his role as a hustling sleazeball. It really is a shame that the actor didn’t get an Oscar nod, and whether you have liked his previous works or not, chances are you will walk out of Uncut Gems impressed by his performance while simultaneously dreading and looking forward to the terrible movie he promised to make if he was snubbed by the Academy.",POSITIVE
"Feb 16, 2020"," I never have been a fan of Adam Sandler movies. The pictures he makes often are vulgar and mean, and some are simply terrible excuses for films. But Sandler as an actor … that’s another thing entirely. I liked him in “Spanglish” and was surprised at his talent in “Reign Over Me” and the astonishing Paul-Thomas Anderson film “Punch-Drunk Love.” Now he may earn an Oscar nomination. And I’m on board with that because of his performance in “Uncut Gems,” an unflinching look at a gambling addict and the people in his life — some of whom want to kill him. Benny and Josh Safdie (“Good Time”) wrote (with Ronald Bronstein) and directed this drama in which Sandler stars as Howard Ratner, a New York jeweler who would rather gamble than anything else, including spend time with the people he loves. His wife Dinah (Idina Menzel, Elsa’s voice in the “Frozen” movies) has had it with Howard’s detachment — he isn’t with her even when he’s beside her. His mistress Julia (Julia Fox) loves him, but feels uneasy about his jealous nature. Howard’s biggest problem is his gambling addiction. He owes a lot of money to his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian). But Howard figures he has a solution: He has purchased an uncut opal straight from an Ethiopian mine, and he plans to sell it for more than $1 million. He continues to gamble and gets in deeper and deeper, lying and trying to manipulate everyone around him while he places bets, ignores his family, hovers over his girlfriend and continues to find himself at odds with more and more people.  This is a loud, sometimes shocking film with more violence than you might expect: In some ways, it resembles mobster movies directed by the likes of Martin Scorsese. Not surprisingly, it contains a lot of yelling, not only from Howard but also the other characters, many of whom are exasperated with him. Howard rarely stops talking and shouting, and his family and others simply try to out-yell him to get his attention. NBA star Kevin Garnett plays himself (he’s very good) as a client who is taken with the uncut opal and thinks it might bring him luck. That means Howard must bet on the game. The character of Howard is unlikable. But he’s always interesting, and while we watch his downward spiral we can’t help but wonder how it’s all going to end in this fast-paced character study that may result in a golden statuette for Sandler.",POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2020"," Brimming with anxious energy, Josh and Benny Safdie’s latest feature is a densely packed medley of memorable lines, characters and debut acting performances. Reminiscent of their previous outing – GOOD TIME – UNCUT GEMS nevertheless applies the anxiety-inducing approach polished there in new and interesting ways. Adam Sandler leads as Howard Ratner, a jeweller in New York City’s Diamond District with a penchant for high-stakes deals and gambling. In a prologue we are introduced, by way of the human misery it has already caused, to a black opal from Ethiopia. Howard has purchased this stone with the intention of auctioning it for a potential seven-figure sum. Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who recruits clients for Howard in exchange for storage of questionably sourced watches, brings in Kevin Garnett (playing himself) of the Boston Celtics. In awe of the opal, Garnett convinces Howard to let him keep the gem overnight in exchange for his NBA championship ring as collateral, believing the opal confers mystical abilities onto him. Howard has a habit of pawning client belongings as part of a precarious daisy chain of deals, cash, and gambling – and his latest gambit starts off a chain reaction he must try to outrun. Much like GOOD TIME, which probably brought on more anxiety headaches than any other film released in 2017, there is rarely a calm moment in UNCUT GEMS. At every stage something is unravelling for our protagonist – whether it is his latest bet, someone screwing him over, his family life, his various dodgy business deals, or his relationship with extra-marital girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox). Beyond the excellent performances and the jittery filming style, the music of Daniel Lopatin polishes this prism of anxiety through which we interpret the characters. Similar to the use of the music in GOOD TIME, the strange collection of synth-like curios feels like an uplifting nightmare; the sort of fog of pain and terror which is endured for the supposed pot of gold at the end of its shit-strewn rainbow. “…the strange collection of synth-like curios feels like an uplifting nightmare; the sort of fog of pain and terror which is endured for the supposed pot of gold at the end of its shit-strewn rainbow.” Adam Sandler is reliably excellent in the lead role, retaining sympathy even as his self-destructive and opportunistic behaviour drags more disaster into his world. Howard is a role that demonstrates Sandler’s curious versatility and duality – on the one hand he is denigrated critically for enormously popular but reductive comedies, on the other he is lauded for blackly comedic drama roles in critically lauded independent work. And never the twain shall meet, apparently. Nevertheless, the on-screen likability that makes many of his comedies tolerable is also what gives him the depth to play the likes of Howard Ratner, Danny Meyerowitz or PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE’s Barry Egan. The Safdies’ film also highlights their capability in eliciting engaging and charismatic performances from debut actors. Julia Fox is an energetic whirlwind and does significant work during the film’s concluding movements. When Sandler isn’t on screen she carries the nervous energy of the film. Kevin Garnett moves between rich exuberance and calm dignity with ease, much more easily than any recent NBA player should be expected to (and more so than anyone familiar with the screen career of Shaquille O’Neal has a right to anticipate). UNCUT GEMS achieves many things, including weaving a compelling tale of addict behaviour augmented and elevated by all the aforementioned elements. The film communicates Howard’s anxiety for his next high, his joy in achieving it, and the crushing despair of failing or having the rug pulled from under him. UNCUT GEMS behaves like a wounded great white shark, constantly moving forward lest it dies, but bleeding out nonetheless. It does this, however, with less kinetic style than GOOD TIME: a film that was often found tracking Robert Pattinson at high speed down streets and around corners. UNCUT GEMS is much more at home jittering nervously in enclosed, claustrophobic spaces like Howard’s car, his double-locked jewellery store, or crowded black-lit nightclubs. The Safdies have not conferred mystical powers onto their film, but like the black opal at its heart, UNCUT GEMS will transfix the viewer by reflecting something a little different back at you depending on what angle you consider it from.",POSITIVE
"Feb 13, 2020"," Take 2014’s Heaven Knows What, which follows a woman torn between her two loves: her boyfriend and heroin. There’s also 2017’s Good Time, which shows the aftermath of a botched bank robbery that turns into a race against the clock for survival (a film that further solidified Robert Pattinson’s art-house cred). In their latest film – Uncut Gems – the Safdies once again create a breakneck-speed film that centers around a law-skirting citizen who can’t help himself from getting in too deep. Uncut Gems follows sleazy huckster Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a fast-talking jeweler whose gambling problems constantly overpower the responsibilities he has as a store manager to his employees and friends (LaKeith Stanfield), his wife (Idina Menzel) and kids, and to his illegitimate girlfriend (Julia Fox). Like any gambler, Howard believes that all of his troubles will be solved with the acquisition of a rare Ethiopian Opal (commonly referred to as “the gamblers gem”), which he intends to sell at auction for a king’s fortune. However, his cockiness blocks his better judgment when he lets Celtics star Kevin Garnett (as himself) borrow the gem for a night, hoping that the Opal’s good luck will help him win the bet he placed on the game. When the Opal isn’t returned on time as promised, Howard is thrust into an intense marathon throughout New York City to track down the Opal, not only to save his future investment but also himself from nasty debt collectors who’ve decided that Howard’s time is up. What follows is dazzling, anxiety-inducing mania that spares no moment for viewers to catch their breath. Handheld and grainy camerawork (Darius Khondji serves as director of photography) lend further pulpy energy to this world that consists of overly-crowded nightclubs, sidewalk screaming matches, and dimly lit casinos. As for the score, Brooklyn-based artist Oneohtrix Point Never, who also scored Good Time, lends electronic and experimental compositions (arcade-style sounds are reminiscent of collecting gold coins in Super Mario video games) that help the audience escape reality and get lost in the world of the madness of the Safdies. Returning to his more dramatic side, Adam Sandler delivers a stunning performance as a man on the edge of a mental breakdown. Those who found Punch Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories a solid platform for the more “serious” Sandler to excel, Uncut Gems will be a welcomed return to the big screen. Proving himself to be one of the most dynamic actors of our time, under the direction of the Safdie’s provocative direction, Sandler’s natural talent is accelerated to new heights. Aside from transforming big-name actors into unrecognizable characters, the Safdies also have a gift when it comes to scouting amateur talent. Here, a majority of the cast are non-actors, including Kevin Garnett, The Weeknd, and Julia Fox (who credits Uncut Gems as her first film). This deliberate decision to cast non-professionals gives off a sense of liberation and unrestricted actions not common in feature films. Like Howard Ratner – a maximalist through and through – Uncut Gems is very much a reflection of his go hard or go home lifestyle. Unsettling in all of the right ways, this film is no doubt a treasure to be sought out and celebrated.",POSITIVE
"Feb 12, 2020"," Deadliest Catch or Sexiest Catch? It's hard to tell at first. Because if that really is a mermaid that fishing trawler hauls out of the Bering Sea in the dead of night, we don't get a good look at it. Whatever it is quickly mauls a fisherman and then scuttles off into the boat's inky hold. And what are the odds that a bunch of US Navy SEALs would immediately abseil down from a helicopter, dart the... creature... and then make off with it and with the wounded fisherman? While it's possible to imagine the current US president establishing a military mermaid taskforce after being gulled by one of the Discovery Channel's fake mermaid documentaries, things still seem a bit, well, fishy. Back on dry land, the small fishing town of Bristol Cove, Washington, is in the swing of its annual mermaid festival, a nice little tourism earner built on mermaid legends dating back to the time of the town's founding. Local trawler magnate Ted Pownall (David Cubitt) takes centre stage at the official proceedings, while events are observed with some displeasure by shopkeeper Helen Hawkins (ever-delightful New Zealander Rena Owen, most recently seen in The Gloaming). One notable absentee is Pownall's marine-biologist son, Ben (Alex Roe), who would rather be down at the local marine research centre with his girlfriend, Maddy (Fola Evans-Akingbola). All well and good, but isn't there a certain mermaid-shaped piece missing? Without giving too much away, let's just say that there's a new girl in town, slightly built, elfin featured, seemingly mute, and possessed of unsettling, twitchy mannerisms that might lead some folks to assume that she's a member of the local methamphetamine community. Belgian actress Eline Powell (a recognisable face to your more tragic Game of Thrones tragics), is terrific in the role, combining the artlessness of the ingenue with the nervy menace of the cornered animal. Equally impressive is the way the effects department handles the mermaid transformations, with echoes of werewolf movies adding to the sense of primal danger. It's all quite well put together, a cut above your usual non-premium, small-town-monster-mystery-meets-military-conspiracy kind of show, and the early episodes deliver some neat surprises. The town's back story of mermaid genocide has obvious parallels with the dispossession of Native Americans, but the series doesn't seem intent on labouring the point. Worth checking out. Workaholics' Adam DeVine and the disembodied voice of Rose Byrne are wonderfully puerile fun in this sweet but dirty-minded rom-com from the makers of The Hangover. DeVine plays mobile-phone addict Phil, a friendless dork who lives in San Francisco and works writing listicles in a clickbait sweatshop. When Phil gets a new phone its Siri-style personal-assistant program (Byrne) turns out to be a foul-mouthed rogue intent on improving his life by tearing it apart. Wanda Sykes is an absolute show-stealer in her little role. Emotionally authentic but procedurally dodgy, this bright-and-busy British series has Top Boy star Ashley Walters and Sherlock's Amanda Abbington as coppers policing Brighton's pebbly beaches. Walters' no-nonsense PC is particularly aggrieved at being made training officer for the superintendent's callow, queue-jumping son (Jacob Ifan). Brighton quickly reveals itself to be a sun-drenched hotbed of daylight ram-raids, nudism, truancy, parkour and racist violence. Slightly rote, but watchable. Adam Sandler's dramatic performances are so much better than his woeful latter-day comedies that he really ought to quit the comedy business altogether. He even got some Oscar buzz for Uncut Gems. It's a brilliantly exhausting movie that gaffer-tapes us to motormouth New York gem dealer and degenerate gambler Howard Ratner (Sandler) as he tells lie after lie and pulls scam after scam trying to get out from under some violent debt collectors. The thrill and despair of the addict are palpable. Even by Narcos standards, the first season of Narcos: Mexico was a harrowing one, leading up as it did to the real-life torture and murder of DEA agent Enrique ""Kiki"" Camarena (so memorably played by Michael Peña). And just when it looked as though the blowback might finally bring down cocaine kingpin Felix Gallardo (Diego Luna), Mexican institutional corruption put him right back on top of the heap. In the new second season it's still 1985 but Gallardo faces a new threat in DEA agent Walt Breslin (Scoot McNairy), who is leading a posse of DEA agents on a campaign of revenge kidnappings. But might the spider become the fly once more? As ever, it's exquisitely written, cast and shot, making great use of Mexico's stunning landscapes, opulent haciendas and colourful '80s fashions. The series does a fine job too of keeping the viewer straight about a big cast of characters – including a little up-and-comer by the name of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman (Alejandro Edda) – and of placing events in the context of American involvement in the war in Nicaragua. Brilliant. It's fitting that the first track we hear in this celebratory but emotionally dappled documentary is Wilson Pickett's Land of 1000 Dances. The rich, elemental energy of the recording encapsulates what would become known as the Muscle Shoals sound. Pickett, Aretha Franklin, Percy Sledge and countless others are on hand to explain how an unlikely outpost of racial harmony in 1960s Alabama changed the courses of lives and careers and brought us some of the most soulful music ever recorded.",POSITIVE
"Feb 11, 2020"," Los directores de Good Time regresan a Netflix con Diamantes en bruto, ofreciendo otra dosis de entretenimiento tan frenético y vertiginoso como insustancial e irritante. Joyas, deudas, apuestas y matones se alían en este banquete de vulgaridad y bullicio difícil de digerir. Inexplicables las buenas críticas recibidas en los medios y la nota de 6,9 con la que se pasea en FilmAffinity –la misma que Burning que es una obra maestra–. Los hermanos Safdie desechan por completo la sutileza y la elegancia para proponer una amalgama de situaciones caóticas llenas de conversaciones que se superponen y personajes que se dedican a lanzarse improperios. Posiblemente sea una de las películas más molestas que he visto en los últimos años. Parece que está hecha por alguien hiperactivo con déficit de atención que no deja que ningún momento respire. Una aplicación práctica del concepto de horror vacui orientado a la generación del Instagram. Lo único salvable de Diamantes en bruto es la actuación de Adam Sandler, la presencia más o menos carismática de Julia Fox y Kevin Garnett y alguna que otra escena moderadamente interesante. En general, es una película para pasar el rato y poco más, aunque exige unos niveles importantes de paciencia y que te adentres en ella con el cerebro medio desconectado. Tampoco me ha gustado Diamantes en bruto, pero debo admitir que la actuación de Adam Sandler estaba a tope. Solamente esto me ha hecho terminar la peli. Creo que el problema con el review viene por el lado de la subjetividad. El arte es así, a cada uno nos provoca cosas diferentes. Yo veo la actuación de Sandler casi excelente, aunque no consigue quitarse cierto no sé qué de su propia personalidad, como que siempre lleva algo de su persona a sus personajes que interpreta. Eso le pasa a muchos actores. Pero el desempeño en este papel igual es excelente, salvo por ese detalle, que no le quita nada al mérito de interpretar una personalidad que no sé si todos conocemos o estamos habituados a ver.
Otro tema aparte es la trama, que si bien es muy interesante, uno puede no estar de ánimo para ver un thriller y sobre todo ver relaciones disfuncionales, una persecución casi constante al propio personaje por sus acreedores y a la vez pensar que eso pasa en la vida real, y el tratar de ponerse en el lugar del personaje (que al menos es lo que yo hago cuando veo una película para entenderlo mejor), creo que da un “sock” importante al espectador que puede o no gustar, pero que cuenta una historia que bien puede ser real, sin problemas, al menos en un lugar tan frenético y materialista como Nueva York.
Así que mi opinión sobre la película es  que es realmente muy buena, sólo que hay que estar de humor para ver un thriller tan demandante.",NEGATIVE
"Feb 10, 2020"," Los hermanos Safdie, Joshua y Benny, han participado en el debate abierto sobre si ver cine en salas para ello, solo ahí, es parecido a verlo en plataformas como la de Netflix. No solo han participado en la discusión, sino que ahora ofrecen un buen filme en dicha plataforma titulado Diamantes en bruto (2019). Los Safdie escribieron: “La cruda realidad es que, como promedio, el público experimenta en video el 80% de vida de cada película. No significa que no debamos hacer todo lo que podamos por proteger la experiencia inspiradora, humana y relajante práctica colectiva de ver una película en el cine”; es una declaración que, bien analizada, defiende ambas opciones. Como crítico, uno desea que hubiese solo buen cine (lógico), algo así como que tengamos mejores películas que superhéroes, vengan de donde vengan estos. Es una lástima que no sea así, por lo menos con la gran industria de Hollywood. En lo personal lamento no poder ver Diamantes en bruto en la pantalla grande de una buena sala de cine. De una vez, he de aclarar que dicho filme alcanza fácilmente la categoría de buena película, pero sin llegar a ser extraordinaria. Que esté o no postulada a un Oscar me tiene sin cuidado, ¡para lo que significa esa estatuilla! Mejor pensemos en la buena trama que tiene la película, que comienza en Etiopía, en 2010, con la obtención de un valioso ópalo. Luego llega a una situación en un hospital en Nueva York, en el 2012, que nos permite conocer al personaje de la película, de presencia absoluta durante el metraje, por lo que el guion pierde la habilidad de manejar subtramas que le habrían venido como anillo al dedo. Una vez que Diamantes en bruto se concentra en su personaje, el núcleo dramático pasa por la actuación del actor que lo encarna, en este caso un histrión poco valorado que ustedes saben quién es: Adam Sandler, quien tiene un registro distinto. Sandler puede ser simpático o no con sus comedias y se le ve casi siempre inexpresivo (pero sin la grandiosidad de un actor eterno en ese estilo, como Buster Keaton). Esta vez pasa a ser lo contrario: en exceso expresivo, con más muecas que las de Robert de Niro en su peor película. Adam Sandler sigue siendo un mal actor. Es una lástima, porque aquí su actuación siempre desaforada le hace perder proporción al buen argumento del filme. De paso, la trama necesita de más equilibrio en su ritmo, por lo que confunde la intensidad dramática con el desorden visual o la agitación injustificada. Eso sí, he de aceptar que Diamantes en bruto sostiene en firme su denuncia social y nos muestra los juegos sucios o mafiosos que se dan en una sociedad manejada por el afán capitalista de la codicia, donde no hay ética alguna, y donde aparecen las apuestas como método supuestamente fácil para enriquecerse. Igual con los asuntos raciales. Creo que Diamantes en bruto ha tenido una buena campaña mediática que la ha sobrevalorado; pero siempre es filme que uno debe recomendar y Netflix da ocasión para verla.

"Feb 8, 2020"," The follow-up to Good Time from Safdie brothers Josh and Benny feels similarly frantic but also proves darker and more unsettling, with a strong, if occasionally infuriating, performance by no less than Adam Sandler.  Having coaxed memorable work from another problem child, Robert Pattinson, in Good Time, here Josh and Benny Safdie similarly push the goofy-comedy-friendly Sandler in new and disquieting directions. Sandler can really act (see Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love, Jason Reitman’s Men, Women & Children and Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories for proof) but rarely stretches himself, and while he was cast after the filmmakers first considered Harvey Keitel, Sacha Baron Cohen and Jonah Hill, he’s still awfully good. Back in 2012 Howard Ratner (Sandler) runs KMH Gems & Jewelry in New York’s ‘Diamond District’, and his life is an increasingly dangerous mess. A compulsive gambling addict who lives and works in chaos, Howard is used to daily situations (like Pattinson’s Connie in Good Time) where a hundred things are happening at once and everyone’s talking (and swearing) incessantly. But chances are the viewer isn’t, and this sort of profanely Robert-Altman-like atmosphere should prove hard to take for more than a few. Howard divides his time between his estranged wife Dinah (Broadway star and Frozen voicer Idina Menzel) and employee and girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox), and owes $100 000 to his loan shark brother-in-law Arno (scary Eric Bogosian), who keeps harassing him with help from some seriously nasty guys. Our flawed protagonist receives a rare black opal first glimpsed in the opening sequence, and although he hopes to auction it off for big money, pay off Arno and then spend quality time with Julia, he instead winds up lending it to one of his favourite customers, Kevin Garnett (the former pro basketballer playing himself rather well). There’s a heavy suggestion that Kevin has glimpsed
something mystical deep within the opal and wants to hold onto it for luck, yet
Howard could certainly do with a fair bit of that himself, as he makes several
more bad decisions and gives the similarly foolish hero of The Gambler
(original 1974, remake 2014) a run for his ill-gotten money. Impressive but somewhat exhausting at 135 minutes, this still has a great deal to admire, from the pitch of nervous tension, to the entire supporting cast (some of whom go uncredited), to Daniel Lopatin’s (who makes electronic music as Oneohtrix Point Never) musical score, to Sandler’s pretty daring playing.  And yet the frenetic aspects here are a little wearying, and you can’t help but long for Howard to yell, “Quiet!”, and plead with everyone to talk one at a damn time. And, with an F-bomb tally surely reaching into the hundreds, the film certainly lives up to its uncut title.",POSITIVE

"Feb 3, 2020"," No, no es Después de hora, aunque Martin Scorsese sea uno de los productores. Pero esta película de los hermanos Benny y Josh Safdie es como si Good Time: Viviendo al límite, con Robert Pattinson, con la que compitieron en 2017 en el Festival de Cannes, hubiera sido el aperitivo -para el espectador- y la mejor preparación para este convite. Adam Sandler se metió a medio mundo en el bolsillo con su interpretación de Howard Ratner. Salvando las distancias, lo mismo logró una década atrás Guillermo Francella con su Pablo Sandoval en El secreto de sus ojos. OK, Sandler tuvo en Embriagado de amor (2002), de Paul Thomas Anderson, una oportunidad que no supo aprovechar. Ambos cambiaron la consideración del público, que los ve con otras aptitudes e idoneidades que les desconocían. Sandler se olvida el payaso en la sala de vestuario -aunque, inevitablemente, los Safdie le dejan servidas un par de humoradas- y se pone en el ropaje de un hiperkinético joyero de Nueva York. Nada parece irle bien, le debe dinero (y mucho) a más de un prestamista, está por separarse de su esposa, cela a su amante. Y confía solamente en una carta. Una carta fuerte. Porque Howard es un jugador empedernido. Un tipo que no puede tener más de cien dólares en el bolsillo que va y los apuesta. Compró un ópalo negro, con varios kilates, que los mineros etiopíes le han vendido por la décima parte de lo que él supone que obtendrá cuando lo subaste. Así piensa saldar todas sus deudas y dejar de escapar hacia adelante, como viene haciendo día tras día, hora tras hora, segundo a segundo. Esa vida frenética se compatibiliza con el ritmo que los Safdie le imprimen a Diamantes en bruto. Uno, sentado en el living de su casa, viendo esta coproducción de Netflix, siente que está en movimiento continuo. ¿Hacia dónde? Hacia el mismo lado. Porque cuando hay indicios de que Howard va a zafar, es él mismo el que parece -no parece, lo hace- boicotearse. Es 2012, pero poco importa más que para que Kevin Garnett, el ala pivot por entonces de los Boston Celtics, sea uno de los que quede fascinado con el ópalo. “Estoy conectado con esta piedra, irradia energía”, dice el basquetbolista que se interpreta a sí mismo. ¿Y qué hace Howard? Se lo presta -a días de la subasta- y va y empeña el anillo de campeón de la NBA de los Celtics. Si hay algo que los Safdie saben es mantener la tensión. No importa los días que pasen, los lugares donde Howard se mueva y hable, o mienta y engañe. Hay una idea de estar corriendo contra el tiempo, que es lo que atrapa. También rescataron a varios intérpretes, alguno como una suerte de guiño (John Amos es un vecino de Howard), llamaron a The Weeknd, el ex de Selena Gomez para también hacer de sí mismo. Y a Eric Bogossian (La radio ataca) y a Judd Hirsch (el psicólogo de Gente como uno) les dieron dos papeles de importancia. Suele suceder que cuando se hablan maravillas de una película o de una actuación, al verlas la experiencia sufra un desencanto. Diamantes en bruto no es Guasón, que tienen en común la sensación de agobio, y que tuvieron sus premières casi al mismo tiempo, una en el Festival de Toronto y la otra en la Mostra de Venecia. Y así como Joaquin Phoenix va a ganar el Oscar y Sandler lo verá, como ha hecho con todas las ceremonias, en su casa, ambos actores logran acaparar toda la atención sobre ellos. De acuerdo, no es solamente la interpretación, hay una historia que engancha y atrapa.",POSITIVE
"Feb 3, 2020",Sandler puts everything into his performance. [Full review in Spanish],POSITIVE
"Feb 1, 2020"," Synopsis: Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) embarks on a long day’s journey into night as he attempts to avoid creditors while leveraging uncut opals that came from an Ethiopian mine. Review: In another of their tour de forces of frantic contingency, the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems may have even surpassed their previous minor masterpiece Good Time as some sort of cinematic parable on the sheer nauseous toxicity of a life lived on the edge in New York City. It’s very much in the lineage of Good Time: the narrative built around unfurling contingencies, the de facto real time feel, and the distinctive stylisation (roving cinematography that approximates the unfolding mess, the fractured synth score, and the lurid neons and chromes of nocturnal NYC). As with Good Time, it’s a thrilling and breathless journey – the Safdies suck you almost viscerally into Howard Ratner (a stellar turn by Adam Sandler) and the conveyor belt of crises he’s forced to manage and/or evade. And much like Good Time, my only marginal, perhaps even churlish, criticism is that the Sadfies almost try to oversell this manic, stressful world view once or twice, especially through the sinister and jagged synthesiser chords that play too much as a literal manifestation of the on-screen chaos.",POSITIVE
"Feb 1, 2020"," Hay un momento de Diamantes en bruto –una auténtica obra maestra, digámoslo de entrada–, en el que The Weeknd, que se interpreta a sí mismo, exige que pongan las luces negras antes de cantar para un reducido grupo de incondicionales en un exclusivo club de Manhattan. La escena tiene su miga. En primer lugar, porque conecta Uncut Gems (título original, más cortito) con la estética de la anterior, y no menos magistral, película de los Safdie, Good Time (2017), una odisea nocturna que se caracteriza por la fotografía fluorescente de Sean Price Williams, aquí revelado por la fotografía nerviosa y los planos cortos de Darius Khondji. El público exclusivo de la discoteca también podría simbolizar a la discreta camarilla de locos seguidores de la que han gozado los Safdie hasta la fecha, incluso con Good Time, una película increíblemente maltratada que, a pesar de haber competido por la Palma de Oro, apenas si recibió premios, y se estrenó de tapadillo en Netflix, además de estrellarse contra muros de obtusa incomprensión. Esperamos que Uncut Gems –en Netflix, a partir del 31 de enero– corra mejor suerte, aunque sólo sea por la estrecha relación que su máximo protagonista, un extraordinario Adam Sandler, mantiene con la plataforma desde sus inicios. En Sandler recae la responsabilidad del reconocimiento de los Safdie.   Dejando de lado que The Weeknd se consideró como un auténtico revolucionario en el ámbito del rap y r&b –al igual que los Safdie en el mundillo del indie americano, que ya padecía falta de autenticidad– la escena también nos trae a la mente El rey de Nueva York (Abel Ferrara, 1990), la película que marcó un antes y un después, con aquel bailoteante Christopher Walken, en la cinéfila relación entre el hip hop y el mundo del hampa. No es extraño que imágenes de otras películas nos bombardeen mientras contemplamos (extasiados) Diamantes en bruto, porque, sin ser en este caso una referencia explícita, los hermanos Josh y Benny Safdie, tal y como ellos mismos nos revelaron en Go Get Some Rosemary (2009), tienen alma de proyeccionistas. Les encanta comentar sus referentes en las entrevistas, y sus películas se construyen a partir del cine del pasado, para proyectarlo hacia un futuro que, sobre todo gracias a ellos, ya está aquí. Así, si dijimos que Good Time es el Libertad condicional (Ulu Grosbard, 1978) del siglo XXI, con Robert Pattinson corriendo en la noche como si fuera Max Dembo, también podemos asegurar, sin que nos tiemble la mano, que Uncut Gems, bien podría ser El asesinato de un corredor de apuestas chino (John Cassavetes, 1976) del Nuevo Milenio, y lo siento si, dejando de lado esa Nueva York que es algo más que el decorado del universo Safdie, he tirado de dos referentes muy de la Costa Oeste. El filme de Grosbard es ineludible al tratarse de la adaptación de la novela de Edward Bunker –ya saben, Mr. Brown–, posiblemente el escritor que mejor ha sabido, por venir de ahí, describir los bajos fondos de la sociedad norteamericana, algo en lo que los Safdie también se han convertido en expertos. De Bunker también han heredado el estupor de la violencia. Es decir, el impacto de esa violencia seca, no espectacularizada, que también se da, y no poco, en Uncut Gems. Podríamos seguir tirando de ahí, y llegar hasta la más espectacular Heat (Michael Mann, 1995), película asesorada por Bunker, sólo para relacionarla con Ladrón (1981), del mismo Mann, que tiene, como Uncut Gems, un poderosísimo personaje central, aquel no menos inmenso James Caan, y luce una estética que a su vez también era una mezcla de suciedad setentera y sintes ochenteros, con Tangerine Dream como antepasados directos de Daniel Lopatin, alias Oneohtrix Point Never, que firma las bandas sonoras tanto de Good Time como de Uncut Gems.  Podríamos seguir ad eternum con el juego de los referentes, pero concentrémonos en la película que nos ocupa, y en su epicentro: Adam Sandler, que posiblemente brinda la interpretación más memorable de su carrera. Él es Howard Ratner, un joyero judío del distrito de diamantes de Nueva York, endeudado hasta las cejas, y adicto al doble o nada, en un perpetua huída hacia adelante con la que bordea constantemente el abismo. Ratner puede parecer un personaje absolutamente despreciable –egoísta, ludópata y carente de escrúpulos–, que ya ha sido calificado con acierto de dickensiano (no diríamos lo mismo de su amante, la deslumbrante Julia Fox), pero no resulta nada difícil identificarse con él, en estos tiempos de frenética inseguridad, amén de que los Safdie saben muy bien cómo dibujar e inyectar humanidad hasta al más nimio de sus personajes. Como el Cosmo Vittelli de Cassavetes, Ratner es un endeudado contra las cuerdas, perseguido por sus acreedores, que se mueve en un entorno que exuda verdad gracias a la cámara nerviosa de los Safdie, que remite al estilo directo del documental, como a la galería de personajes, en buena parte sacados de la calle, con los que se cruza a lo largo de 135 minutos que se disfrutan con un nudo en el estómago. Los Safdie vuelven a demostrar que son maestros de ese ritmo adrenalínico (no por nada se les pasó por la cabeza un remake de Límite 48 Horas, clásico thriller a contrarreloj), que nos retuerce las entrañas, en una mezcla perversa de angustia y placer.   Scorsese, que se sumó al proyecto como productor ejecutivo, tuvo que tener claro que hoy en día no hay nadie como ellos para recuperar el realismo sucio de los 70, y empaparlo en un humor lisérgico, profundamente contemporáneo que tampoco le es ajeno (recuérdese la magistral El lobo de Wall Street). Good Time y Diamantes en bruto forman una doble sesión imbatible para los que buscan thrillers realistas y trepidantes, pero también son películas esenciales para cualquier cinéfilo que se precie. Un retrato de tan honda humanidad como el que protagoniza Adam Sandler no se ve muy a menudo. Está de Oscar, aunque, claro, la pulcra, apolillada y conservadora Academia de Hollywood nunca le entregaría una dorada estatuilla a un marrano. Eso que se pierden.",POSITIVE
"Feb 1, 2020"," Magic rocks, diamond-encrusted Furbies, Adam Sandler: all the arcane forces of the universe come to bear on Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems (available on Netflix January 31), an electrifying sprint through Manhattan’s high-stakes, fame-adjacent netherworld of sports betting and Midtown hustlers that’s as much cosmic fable as gauntlet-running indie thriller. “They say you can see the whole universe in opals,” says middle-aged jeweller Howard Ratner (Sandler), spellbound by the newly excavated gemstone that sets the plot in motion, “that’s how fuckin’ old they are.” The ancient power awakens in the film’s opening moments, the camera swooping like a locust across an Ethiopian mine to find a bunch of workers, overseen by their multinational bosses, in an opal-struck frenzy that recalls nothing so much as the discovery of the demon idol in The Exorcist. In one of their dazzling, amusing formal tricks, the Safdies then push in on the rainbow colours of the gem (a high-tech version of the eerie shot in Australian filmmaker Alena Lodkina’s Strange Colours [2017]), via what feels like the entire universe, only to emerge right among the squishy innards of Howard himself, prostrate, mid colonoscopy, in a New York doctor’s office. Talk about a possession. Set to the New Age electronic score of Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never), which channels Tomita’s bleeps in the Safdies’ Heaven Knows What (2014), the sequence has a strange, holistic calm – in stark contrast to the nervy, chattering chaos of the city’s Diamond District, the crucible of the film’s action. It’s here, in this seemingly lost-in-time, quintessential New York space – just seconds from the oppressive jumbotron fantasia of Times Square – that Howard, slippery in a leather jacket and the leisure polo of a galactic card shark, holds court as a manic duke of the jewel trade. He flips watches, rings and memorabilia to clients, from shady goombahs to slumming sports stars (often lured into his orbit by his wily assistant, Demany, played by Lakeith Stanfield.) Howard’s is a world of spinning plates: crumbling family life with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) on Long Island; a slick uptown pad and a mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), in the city; and rising gambling debts that have put a pack of gravelly voiced goons, led by his grouchy brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian), on his tail. Stirred into the mix is NBA star Kevin Garnett (played by the man himself), whom Howard tempts with his custom-bejewelled Furbies – a totem of some bizarre, alternate consumer timeline. Their bugged-out eyes, savoured in disconcertingly goofy close-up, seem to portend the nerve-wracking delirium to follow. But Garnett is quickly ensnared by the opal, believing it will bring him a winning streak on the court, while Howard thinks the opal’s energy comes from its discovery by displaced African Jews. Each is bewitched in his own way, the uncut rock, like some Tolkienian ring, giving shape to its beholder’s best and worst instincts. (In one sequence, Garnett touches the gem and triggers a hallucinatory montage that seems to span both the history of Africa and the NBA playoffs.) The film is set in 2012, itself a strange interzone where The Weeknd (also appearing as his younger self) is a fledgling R&B singer on the verge of stardom (“What the fuck is a Weeknd?” grumbles Howard), and Instagram posts are still framed by the blocky queen blue – a world away from the present, where the app currently features Uncut Gems selfie filters with gold chains and Furby pendants for a new generation of aspirant bling ringers. The Safdies, who grew up between Manhattan and Queens, were just lo-fi filmmakers at the time, but their subsequent ascent has been spectacular. This is the brothers’ first film since 2017’s Good Time, a breakout hit that ricocheted bleached-blond scammer Robert Pattinson through a pinball machine of similarly random circumstance, and also revelled in their love for the city that reared them – in all of its cacophonous, race-and-class melting-pot glory. Pattinson’s work with the Safdies was seen less as star transformation than an extension of his daring independent turn, but Sandler’s performance – notoriously, and foolishly, snubbed in recent Oscar nominations – has drawn the predictable backhanded praise reserved for the comedian. For years, Sandler has been anathema to a certain type of snob, the kind of middle-brow cineastes who insist that the actor’s only good performances exist in the likes of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love (2002) or Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories (2017) – “proper” films seen as aberrations in a career otherwise dedicated to peddling broad comedies. This approach diminishes Sandler’s gift for manic character study and unpredictable comic rhythm; tolerated in “dumb” classics like Billy Madison (1995) and Happy Gilmore (1996), sure, but sadly overlooked in his later works, such as the inclusive, hilarious Zionist parody You Don’t Mess With the Zohan (2008) or his much-maligned, though very charming, gender-switch pantomime Jack and Jill (2011) (which also happens to include Al Pacino’s best 21st-century performance this side of The Irishman). Sandler’s performance in Uncut Gems isn’t some great metamorphosis, as such; it’s Sandler doing what he’s always done best: cultivating an uneasy, livewire anxiety that pulses on top of his characters’ essentially humble, flawed humanity. There’s a scene here in which his badly beaten-up Howard – tissue paper jammed up his nostrils, a pendulum of drool swinging from his lips – is whimpering in his lover’s arms, and it’s all but indistinguishable from any of his man-baby tantrums of yore. I felt bad for the guy but also cackled, and I suspect directors and star would be happy with either response (after all, what’s funnier, and more absurd, than human plight). Sandler’s genius is his ability to convey that highest mode of expression: a synthesis of sincerity and satire, wrapped up in a ball of snot. And where plenty of movies have depicted the hapless travails of Dostoevskian putzes chasing that one lucky score – usually at their comedic expense – the Safdies are, like Sandler, empathetic chroniclers of the desperate and down-on-their-luck. They don’t pity or patronise Howard but embrace him, and we share in his euphoria – despite that fact that he’s kind of a dirtbag. Likewise, there’s a surfeit of wonderfully drawn, rough-around-the-edges supporting performances: among them the fantastic Julia Fox, holding her head defiantly high in tandem with cinematographer Darius Khondji’s breathtaking tracking shots; and Frozen balladeer Menzel, who goes from priceless, exasperated disdain at her husband’s exploits to full-tilt comedic withering. “Your face is so stupid,” she screams at Howard, on the verge of post-Passover divorce. “You are the most annoying person I have ever met.” Even richer: an appearance from real-life New York character Wayne Diamond, who drops into the action like a leathery angel of fate, and a cameo from Good Times (1974–79) and Coming to America (1988) star John Amos, which I half expected to conclude with him telling Howard to “Stay off the drugs.” As Howard drills himself ever deeper into trouble, and the opal carves its own path toward destiny, Uncut Gems barely has time to pause for breath, like a playoff game starring New York’s jewellery–dealing underworld where Lopatin’s high-strung score and Billy Joel’s “The Stranger” stand in for the courtside “Charge” fanfare. (You’d better believe the Safdies crank that shit loud.) “What is it about you Jews and basketball?” Demany asks Howard at one point, and indeed both character (who’s frequently seen glued to the game) and filmmakers (whose Lenny Cooke followed a teenage ball player) are obsessed to an infectious degree. When Howard, rapt in a Celtics game, exclaimed, “It’s all down to the last two minutes,” he wasn’t kidding: Uncut Gems burns itself right to the wire, leading to an astonishingly tense and funny climax – set against the outcome of the actual 2012 Boston versus Philadelphia playoff match – that pivots on, of all things, a faulty office door buzzer. When the camera finally returns to flesh, and into the cosmos, you can almost feel the universe chuckling like some celestial bookmaker, shades tilted, pearly smile flashing, as if to throw the much-memed Sandler moment back at humanity: “This is how I win.” Magic rocks, diamond-encrusted Furbies, Adam Sandler: all the arcane forces of the universe come to bear on Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems (available on Netflix January 31), an electrifying sprint through Manhattan’s high-stakes, fame-adjacent netherworld of sports betting and Midtown hustlers that’s as much cosmic fable as gauntlet-running indie thriller. “They say you can see the whole universe in opals,” says middle-aged jeweller Howard Ratner (Sandler), spellbound by the newly excavated gemstone that sets the plot in motion, “that’s how fuckin’ old they are.” The ancient power awakens in the film’s opening moments, the camera swooping like a locust across an Ethiopian mine to find a bunch of workers, overseen by their multinational bosses, in an opal-struck frenzy that recalls nothing so much as the discovery of the demon idol in The Exorcist.

"Jan 31, 2020"," Aunque siempre hay lugar para alguna que otra agradable sorpresa, la tónica general en la industria actual, centrándonos en todo momento en los grandes estudios norteamericanos, invita a pensar en una sequía creativa en la que plantillas y fórmulas dominan el grueso de producciones. Pero dentro de este desolador y nada estimulante desierto, una —cada vez menos— pequeña compañía como A24 se ha ganado a pulso la etiqueta de oasis fílmico. Desde sus inicios, la productora de la Gran Manzana nos ha brindado piezas de la talla de 'Under the Skin', 'Ex-Machina', 'Lady Bird' o 'Hereditary', destacando entre su catálogo del año 2017 una brutal 'Good Time' que puso en la candelero el nombre de los hermanos Safdie, reafirmándoles como un dúo de cineastas tan brillantes como únicos en cuanto a sello autoral respecta tras haber enamorado al público indie con su 'Heaven Knows Why'. Con 'Diamantes en bruto', Ben y Joshua han llevado un paso más allá la propuesta de la cinta protagonizada por Robert Pattinson en un ejercicio de estilo descomunal, tan arriesgado como jugarse una final de conferencia con un triple en el último segundo. 135 minutos de pura adrenalina sin cortar encabezada por un Adam Sandler gigantesco que ya tiene un hueco reservado en mi top con las mejores películas de un 2020 que acaba de empezar. Si algo hace tan grande al —buen— cine, es su capacidad para generar sensaciones genuinas y extrañamente orgánicas en el respetable. Desde su paso por el Festival de Telluride, han sido muchas las voces que han reivindicado 'Diamantes en bruto' como lo más parecido a un ataque de ansiedad cinematográfico a lo que podamos enfrentarnos; algo que puedo corroborar después de haber pasado dos horas con las palmas de las manos empapadas de sudor y respirando a bocanadas. Esta reacción a lo acontecido en pantalla es posible, en parte, gracias al endiablado ritmo que han insuflado Los Safdie a su violenta odisea neoyorquina. Tras una breve secuencia introductoria y una transición imposible, el detonante no tarda en aparecer, desencadenando una auténtica maratón entre rascacielos y suburbios ante la que es complicado no terminar exhausto. 'Diamantes en bruto' posee un magnetismo impensable para tratarse de un filme que te golpea una y otra vez sin ningún tipo de piedad a cada revés que sufre su protagonista. Una deliciosa tortura que impide apartar la mirada, filmada con un nervio próximo al caos ordenado —las conversaciones son antológicas—, capaz de sacar de sus casillas al espectador más templado, y narrada en un crescendo constante, de esos que te hacen apretar la mandíbula y rechinar los dientes inconscientemente. El dominio de la cámara y la maestría en la puesta en escena de los Safdie se ven enriquecidos por un tratamiento formal casi temerario. Rodado en un 35mm dominado por el grano y las texturas más crudas, el largometraje aísla a su protagonista y le oprime contra los escenarios de la jungla de asfalto en la que intenta sobrevivir, combinando zooms, focales largas y movimientos de seguimiento imposibles en una apuesta visual que va mucho más allá de su espíritu ochentero. Ha quedado claro que, formal y narrativamente, 'Diamantes en bruto' es un auténtico prodigio; pero aún queda una bala en la recámara, con nombre y apellido, para terminar de volarnos la cabeza por completo. Esta no es otra que un Adam Sandler libre y desatado que nos regala la mejor interpretación de su carrera, perilla en ristre, y enfundado en una abrigo de cuero que grita 2012 —año en que se ambienta la película— a los cuatro vientos. 'Diamantes en bruto' toma todo lo que hizo grande a 'Good Time' y lo eleva a la enésima potencia con una salvaje representación de la conjunción latina ""lupus est homo homini"" que, desgraciadamente, el público español no podrá disfrutar en todo su esplendor —verla en pantalla grande, además de un privilegio, es una experiencia impagable—. Por suerte, el buen cine sigue siéndolo independientemente del tamaño de la superficie sobre la que se proyecte.",POSITIVE
"Jan 31, 2020"," Los hermanos Safdie han mostrado una mano notablemente audaz al momento de dirigir sus cortometrajes y películas. Desde la feroz readaptación del clásico infantil Le ballon rouge (1966) en The Black Balloon (2012), pasando por el agudo retrato de adicción a la heroína en Heaven Knows What (2014), hasta llegar a la exploración del frenesí y la desesperación en Good Time (2017), Josh y Benny Safdie redefinen la urbanidad neoyorquina en términos distintos a los de maestros como Martin Scorsese o Sidney Lumet. Su visión, más ágil pero también más cínica, filma la urbe como un asfixiante laberinto de concreto y cristal, que en el caso de su más reciente largometraje, Diamantes en bruto, encierra lo sagrado y lo profano en una vitrina de joyería. Adam Sandler interpreta a Howard Ratner, un joyero neoyorquino que constantemente busca aumentar sus ganancias a través de empeños, subastas y apuestas arriesgadas y cuantiosas en el basquetbol. En medio del acoso de usureros, el rechazo de su esposa (Idina Menzel) y de su familia y la inestable relación con su joven amante (Julia Fox, extraordinaria), Howard recibe desde minas africanas una extraña opalina incrustada de gemas que capturan la atención del célebre basquetbolista Kevin Garnett, de quien dependerá la última apuesta de Howard, la más audaz de todas. La película inicia con la extracción de la opalina en una mina etíope, cuyas resplandecientes gemas son exploradas por la cámara antes de transformarse en la colonoscopia de Howard. Los Safdie comienzan su frenético relato con la misma audacia que habrá de llegar hasta el final de sus poco más de dos horas de duración. El vigor de su estilo, prodigiosamente refinado en Good Time, parece venir de los clásicos de Cannon Films –como 52 Pick-Up (1986)– e incluso el estupendo score de Daniel Lopatin parece evocar ese espíritu constantemente, tan sucio e inmoral como atrayente y adictivo. Uncut Gems, su título en inglés, podría parecer a primera vista una película sobre los peligros que rodean a la codicia, pero apunta a un lugar muy diferente: la necesidad de ganar y de creer que el destino se puede controlar a través de una apuesta. Si la apuesta se gana, es posible adelantarse al designio divino y llegar a un punto casi orgásmico, pero si se pierde, siempre existe la oportunidad de volver a intentarlo. Eso es lo que nos hace identificarnos con él irremediablemente: la incapacidad de detener nuestra propia espiral hacia abajo y dejar de apostarle a nuestra propia tragedia. La peor decisión es la de desear “ganar”, quizá por ello, no dejamos de tomarla.

"Jan 31, 2020"," Después de ver sus tres notabilísimas últimas películas queda patente que los hermanos Safdie saben filmar el desasosiego y provocar la excitación del espectador, quizá incluso el estrés desaforado, insoportable y apasionante. En Heaven Knows What (2014), inédita en España, acompañando a una heroinómana sin techo en una ficción sobre su propia vida, con impactante realismo y estridente música electrónica. En Good Time (2017), estrenada en sección oficial del Festival de Cannes, con la lisérgica odisea nocturna de un hombre desesperado por conseguir dinero para una fianza. En Diamantes en bruto, que se estrena hoy exclusivamente en Netflix, con la cruel y casi cómica descripción de otra adicción, la del juego, expuesta en los tartamudeos vocales, las exasperantes mentiras y la tierna huida hacia delante de un joyero crápula de mirada aterrada, desquiciado vendemotos profesional al que encarna con maestría Adam Sandler. Como siempre en Ben y Joshua Safdie hay mucho del cine estadounidense de los setenta en su nuevo trabajo. En Heaven Knows What entroncaban con Pánico en Needle Park, la obra maestra de Jerry Schatzberg. En Good Time lo hacían con ¡Jo, qué noche!, que es de los ochenta pero con espíritu de los setenta. Y en Diamantes en bruto, de nuevo con Martin Scorsese, esta vez con el de Malas calles y su cine de rabia desbocada, a borbotones, con desequilibrios de guion pero con inusitada fuerza visual y sonora; y también con el Robert Altman de la insólita y ludópata California Split, y esas secuencias con cuatro o cinco personajes hablando a la vez, sin apenas profundidad de campo, turbadoras y conmovedoras. El insigne fotógrafo iraní Darius Khondji, que debuta con los Safdie, impone unas texturas ásperas, de grano duro, iluminando una puesta en escena radicada en los primerísimos planos de Sandler y en la utilización del teleobjetivo en las fascinantes secuencias de calle. Y el formidable uso del sonido para acabar de taladrar el celebro del espectador, música electrónica de Daniel Lopatin, recursos insignes como el ruido de la puerta de la joyería cada vez que se abre, completa una obra sobresaliente en lo formal y en lo interpretativo, con gran debut de la actriz de reparto Julia Fox, y sorprendente presencia del exjugador de la NBA Kevin Garnett, que hace de sí mismo con inusitada desmitificación. Sin embargo, como ya ocurría también con sus anteriores películas, el fondo se queda algo corto. ¿Una comedia criminal sobre la codicia? Sí, obvio, pero quizá insuficiente en este aspecto, pues apenas hay más subtextos a los que agarrarse, algo no imprescindible pero sí aconsejable. Ahora bien, el glorioso desenlace, a contracorriente y suicida, seco y cortante, rodado sin subrayados, te deja atónito. Continuemos siguiendo a los Safdie.",POSITIVE
"Jan 31, 2020"," The greatest scene in Uncut Gems — a great film — involves Adam Sandler’s character coming face-to-face with the object of his desire. It’s an object that he has been tirelessly trying to acquire for about an hour. As audience members, we’ve been made aware that if he fails to obtain the object in a certain amount of time, he’d be at the risk of losing everything — his family, every last penny he has, and perhaps even his life.  But when the elusive object is finally within touching distance, Sandler’s character — a New York jeweller by the name of Howard Ratner — realises, along with us, that the glass door separating him from it is jammed. Howard proceeds to do everything in his power to pry the door open; he would’ve taken an axe to it, but we’ve been told that it is bulletproof.  It is perhaps the most thrilling, frustrating and anxiety inducing action scene of the year — but not a single punch is thrown, nor a single shot fired. The effect of the scene, and of Uncut Gems in general, is to tether you, for two hours, to the most repulsive train wreck of a man as he digs himself into a hole, and then attempts to claw his way out of it — painfully, repetitively, unsuccessfully. You’re the explosive vest strapped onto the body of a suicide bomber.  Howard is having a bad day -- he’s up to his neck in debt, the million-dollar ‘uncut gem’ he spent a year trying to get his hands on has sort of been stolen, his wife is divorcing him, his children seem to be turning into him, his mistress is seeing someone else, he’s worried he might have colon cancer, and to make matters worse, the door of his showroom is jammed.  While the escalation of tension is almost unbearably relentless, the lasting sensation of watching Uncut Gems is almost like tumbling down a hill, with no branch to cling on for support. There is an inevitability to Howard’s actions; you know that it won’t end well for him, but you want it to. Directors Josh and Benny Safdie pull off the most difficult dramatic deadlift; they make you care about a self-destructive man with next to no redeeming qualities. Uncut Gems is the most accurate film about addiction since perhaps Steve McQueen’s Shame. It features what is without a doubt the greatest performance Adam Sandler has given in his career. Uncut Gems finds him in rare dramatic form; it’s a weapon in his arsenal that the actor keeps hidden, breaking it out on occasion, almost as if to reassure himself that it still works. This isn’t the Jack & Jill version of Sandler; this is Sandler in Punch Drunk Love and Funny People form — an utterly magnetic and imposing screen presence.  As Howard pinballs from one bad decision to the next, all you can do is observe in horror as his life disintegrates before his eyes. You root for him not because you want him to win, you root for him because you want him to survive.  The Safdies’ version of New York is unlike any other. It is perhaps on the opposite end of the spectrum from Woody Allen’s romanticised idea of the city. Even Martin Scorsese, who is one of the executive producers on Uncut Gems, allows a certain sentimentality to seep into his New York films, as grounded as some of them may be. The Safdies, meanwhile, almost appear to be chipping away the decades of cinematic sheen that has polished the city’s reputation. In Uncut Gems, they take turns down alleys that we’ve never seen on screen; areas like the Diamond District are rarely represented in movies, and therefore, almost exotic. This is the first time that the Safdies are working with the legendary cinematographer Darius Khondji, who last lensed New York for director James Gray in The Immigrant. On the surface, you wouldn’t be able to tell that you’re viewing the city through the same man’s prism; but there is an unforgiving quality to NYC in both films. It’s a place that can consume just about anyone, regardless of how successful they may be.  Howard isn’t someone you’d pay much attention to if you were to pass him by on the street, even if he were arguing with his mistress, begging forgiveness of a couple of gangsters, or being pushed into a large fountain. Big cities are great equalisers. Everybody always has somewhere they need to be.  Through the course of Uncut Gems, Howard’s path crosses with dozens of people, most of whom he appears to already have some sort of relationship with. He haggles with pawn dealers and confronts up-and-coming music stars; he pleads with his wife and bumps into NBA champions. For someone who depends so desperately on other human beings, he’s quite alone in life. It’s the ultimate parable about the modern man — a creature pushed to his limits by a world that has no time for hesitation and humility. It’s a world where everybody is expendable, a competitive arena that systematically beats the decency out of people and pushes them to insane limits just to be able to feel something. Anything.  In the years to come, the power and relevance of Uncut Gems will be appreciated even more. It is a capsule of our terrible times; a lightning-in-a-bottle movie that will be studied in schools, debated among our (hopefully) saner descendants, and discussed endlessly on Letterboxd. Who cares if it was ignored by the Academy? It will far outlive the Oscars it wasn’t nominated for. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 31, 2020"," On paper, Uncut Gems reads like a tale of Talmudic recompense, the story of Jewish diamond dealer Howard Ratner, his debts, his rocky marriage and his pending colon cancer diagnosis during Passover. Howard, played by Adam Sandler, is a rough-around-the-edges father of three, and in the hands of lesser filmmakers, his story mightâve made for an adequately charming dramedy about working oneâs way out of financial corners and making amends with family. It is, in a way, but in the hands of Josh and Benny Safdie â whose sleazy, high-intensity New York indies feel like genetic hybrids between John Cassavetes and 1970s Times Square pornos â the film proves to be intoxicating on the surface, and downright stressful underneath. Uncut Gems is one of the very few movies to exude BME: Big Mad Max: Fury Road Energy. Itâs a mile-a-minute masterpiece punctuated by shots of adrenaline, and anchored by career-best work from Sandler and everyone involved. Itâs not just about a man trying to be righteous in an un-righteous world â Jordan Hoffman calls it â
aggressively Jewish
â in his Times of Israel interview with the Safdies â itâs also about how that struggle for righteousness gets complicated when addiction is thrown in the mix. Where the Safdiesâ recent efforts (Good Time, Heaven Knows What) plunge into the world of street drugs, Uncut Gems is about a man who canât stop betting on basketball games. In some ways, the film even follows the structure of a sports film; it features the same highs and lows, the same speeches and rousing moments, and the same cross-cut climax involving the big game and secondary characters watching it intently â only itâs told from the perspective of one of those outsiders looking in. But basketball, and sports betting, are just the vehicles for Howardâs real addiction. The high he chases is success, in whatever twisted form he can get it and no matter how much it hurts him. Howardâs way in to the world of NBA happens to be real-life Boston Celtics player Kevin Garnett, who plays a warped version of himself during
the summer of 2012
. Upon visiting Howardâs window-less showroom in New Yorkâs Diamond District (accompanied by Lakeith Stanfield as hot-headed assistant Demany, who helps Howard reach high-profile Black clientele), Garnett becomes obsessed with a gorgeous uncut black opal, which Howard painstakingly smuggled from an Ethiopian Jewish tribe. Garnett, or âKG,â is convinced the opal gives him mystical good luck, but the stone isnât for sale; in fact, Howard has just agreed to auction it so he can pay people back. Through a barter intended to be temporary, the stone ends up in Garnettâs possession for longer than Howard can afford. Given the number of people Howard already owes â including a group of tough-as-nails loan sharks who begin to stalk him at family events â he goes down a path of increasingly desperate hijinks. What little money he does make ends up with his bookie, in case he can make some more, and the snowball effect of his borrowing-and-betting soon leads to chaos. Itâs this chaos which the Safdie brothers are so adept at capturing, and which editors Benny Safdie and Ronald Bronstein (who co-wrote the film) build on so methodically, ultimately re-shaping it in the filmâs heart-pounding climax, into something rhythmic and euphoric. The film is cacophonous, rife with overlapping dialogue that makes even small-talk teeter towards sensory overload. However, it achieves momentary serenity in the moments someone talks business; this clarity makes Howard, and the audience, perk up and pay attention. Similarly, objects and people which Howard finds alluring (financially, sexually, or both), exhibit a luminescent quality. Mere minutes into the film, as Howard goes about a regular work day, his messy state of mind is crystal clear to us: everything and everyone is noise â unless they can help him either crawl out from under his debts, or place new bets. Howard is a man who has nothing but good luck, even at betting, but he either squanders it at every turn, or has it squandered by people he already owes. The filmmakers constantly subvert expectations by setting up scenes where it seems like his personal life is about to implode, and then it doesnât (among them: a secret visit to his young mistress, played by Julia Fox, that feels like it could go wrong in ten different ways). Yet moments later, Howardâs addiction causes things to implode anyway, either through his own actions or six-degree domino effects. Sandler plays Howard as a man spread paper-thin, both by his financial situation and by his life on the brink of divorce. Every exhausted line of dialogue is uttered from between clenched jaws, as a forced smile sits jaggedly beneath his eyes. If youâre alive and reading this in the shit-show that is 2020, itâs hard not to see him as a mirror. He radiates the feeling of âbarely keeping it together,â in what isnât just the best performance of his career, but the best performance by any American actor in 2019; itâs a sham(e) the Oscars donât recognise this. Each supporting performance stands out too, thanks in part to the Safdiesâ penchant for filling non-star roles with everyday people. Non-actors, first-time actors, and veterans usually relegated to the margins all shine in the Safdiesâ work, especially in Uncut Gems, where characters veer in and out of Howardâs day at breakneck speed, but still leave a lasting impact. Itâs one of the few films to capture the radioactive, in-your-face energy of walking down a crowded New York sidewalk. The Safdiesâ gritty approach extends, unapologetically, to their use of faces and bodies far outside âconventionally attractiveâ norms. Itâs realism as stylism in the context of Hollywood gloss, whether itâs Sandlerâs naked âdad bodâ during vulnerable moments, or a uniquely-shaped face youâd remember vividly if you passed it on the street. Each close-up reveals seams most often hidden by makeup, from wrinkles to razor burns, and each character gets to look as achingly human as they feel.

Most of the film unfolds in dim locales, but itâs never hard to tell whatâs actually happening; often times, mere glimpses of eyes or mouths are enough to convey a core sensation. The film was shot using long, anamorphic lenses, which make every rapid lateral movement feel disorienting, especially in tight spaces. The deep black-ness in the frame provides a greater contrast with the garish colours â most often, hues of blue â and shooting these low-light scenes on 35mm lends itself to a heavy film grain reminiscent of seedy â80s crime flicks (picture
Joker
âs aesthetic, but actually purposeful). The combination of grain and lens choice adds a peculiar, fluid texture to the aforementioned un-made-up faces, as if your eyes are meant to dart towards and around them, taking in each imperfect detail. When Howard is kidnapped in a dimly-lit car, all the characters are shot almost entirely in closeup. Relevant exposition claws its way out from under chaotic yelling â you barely notice the word âfuckâ is used a record
408 times
â as more than half the screen is occupied either by Sandlerâs disheveled five oâclock shadow, or Bogosianâs world-weary dark circles. Itâs a scene emblematic of most of the film, and the collective effect is nerve-wracking; all thatâs missing is the stench of stress sweat. I could spend all day fawning over the plot â have you really experienced cinema if you havenât seen the star of Grown Ups 2 fight a coked-up The Weekend, awash in black light and set to
Kendrick Lamar
? â but words pale in comparison to being swept up in the filmâs discordant melody (punctuated by the
unsettling synth sounds
of experimental musician Oneohtrix Point Never). Uncut Gems is the kind of movie that burrows into your pores. It makes you feel unclean, but itâs also a rapturous experience; a ârollercoaster of emotionsâ insofar as the rollercoaster has malfunctioned mid-loop, oscillating back and forth while youâre suspended in free-fall.",POSITIVE
"Jan 31, 2020","Despite Adam Sandler doesn't deliver an extraordinary performance, he surprises with this character. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Jan 30, 2020"," Chaotic, high-stakes thriller Uncut Gems is the latest from brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, who seem to have struck a rich cinematic vein as purveyors of propulsive, tragicomic New York City odysseys. Their previous offering, the deceptively titled Good Time, saw Robert Pattinson on the run after a botched bank robbery — the glamourous Brit remade as a wild-eyed, greasy-haired lowlife. It's Adam Sandler's star wattage that powers Uncut Gems, as the comedian — many of whose films of late have seemed little more than thinly disguised summer vacations for him and his buddies — ventures outside his comfort zone, with dazzling results. (Not that he hasn't proven his mettle as an actor before — he shone in Paul Thomas Anderson's Punch-Drunk Love, as he did more recently in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories.) As perpetually wheeling-and-dealing Diamond District jeweller Howard Ratner, Sandler swaps his trademark toilet humour for flashy stud earrings, a set of fake chompers, and a walk-in closet full of garish Gucci threads. A fearless 21st century take on the age-old stereotype of the avaricious Jewish merchant, Howard has an obsession with money that goes well beyond simply keeping himself, his family, and his considerably younger, doe-eyed mistress Julia (newcomer Julia Fox, playing a fictionalised version of herself) in the style to which they've all become accustomed. And, with an unchecked gambling habit that complements his deep love of basketball (a love shared by Sandler and the Safdies), he's found himself trapped in a complex web of bets and debts of his own reckless making. Howard's attempts at keeping creditors at bay with reassuring words and Rolexes (fake ones), both distributed like candy as he wends his way daily through midtown Manhattan, are becoming less and less effective. He's banking (quite literally) on the arrival of a hefty and long-awaited Ethiopian black opal, which he believes will bring in over a million dollars at auction, and so enable him to pay back — firstly — the hundred grand he owes to Arno, his loan shark brother-in-law (the riveting Eric Bogosian, most recently seen in Succession), as well as the numerous other money-lenders and bookies he's got on his back. This being a Safdie brothers film, predominantly non-professional actors are cast in these supporting roles — diamonds in the rough, plucked from the city streets and shopfronts; collectively a rogues' gallery worthy of Diane Arbus. The title sequence suggests that Howard is cosmically bound to his beloved opal. In the course of a dazzling virtual rollercoaster ride through its striated interior, the cavity walls change from midnight blue in colour to pink and fleshy — the journey culminating as an image on a computer in Howard's doctor's office, where the protagonist is midway through a colonoscopy. (OK, so there is a dash of toilet humour in the film.) Indeed, through cinematographer Darius Khondji's lens, the film itself appears to be under the stone's spell. From the icy blue light that bathes Howard's claustrophobic showroom to the black-lit club where he sees The Weekend play, through to the forest green glow of the trunk of his Mercedes (where he's briefly confined), the film's colour palette could well be termed opalescent. Khondji's prismatic camerawork is paired with a shimmering, ominous score by Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never, whose music also played a major role in creating the nervy ambience of Good Time. Upon its delivery, the opal quickly gains another ardent admirer in basketball legend Kevin Garnett, who plays himself circa 2012 — when the film is set — in an auspicious screen debut. The Boston Celtics power forward drops by Howard's shop in the company of Demany (Lakeith Stanfield, of Knives Out), the go-between responsible for reeling in cashed-up potential clients. ""They say you can see the whole universe in opals, that's how f*ckin' old they are,"" wheedles Howard, eager to impress, as KG drinks in the rock through a loupe. ""This is old school, Middle-earth shit."" Sufficiently impressed, Kevin is determined to borrow it for the night, convinced that it has talismanic properties that will help him ""destroy Philly"" out on the court. Of course, he generally needs no encouragement in that arena. And that's because what drives him is not the idea of getting rich (or rather, richer), but the orgasmic rush of winning — a rush that he'll pursue at all costs. This applies to his broken-down marriage too. ""Gimme another shot,"" he beseeches his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel, best known as the voice of Frozen's Elsa) at Passover seder, oblivious to the depth of her contempt for him, even after she laughs raucously in his face. It's this kind of relentless optimism, and the full-bodied excitement he displays at every windfall, that ties Howard to the overgrown man-children Sandler made his name portraying: f*ck-ups who blunder through life see-sawing between sweetness and rage, their essential naivete somehow intact. Though the film initially meanders a little — marinating in its own, finely textured world — the pace steadily ramps up across the 135-minute run-time, fuelled by the accumulation of Howard's erratic choices, until reaching something that feels uncomfortably like fever-pitch. Equal parts infuriating and exhilarating, Uncut Gems is an accomplished piece of high-anxiety cinema from a pair of filmmakers with a clear knack for the form, a sense of their own, deeply felt excitement emanating from the frame.

"Jan 30, 2020", It’s not often you get to write the words “Adam Sandler” and “Shakespearean” in the same sentence. But that is the perfect adjective to describe his character in the Safdie brothers’ marvelous new film “Uncut Gems” (out Friday on Netflix). ,POSITIVE
"Jan 30, 2020"," There were numerous egregious snubs when the Academy announced its crop of Oscar nominations a few weeks ago. Many rightfully furrowed their brows at Lupita Nygon’o missing out for the year’s finest leading female performance found in Jordan Peele’s Us. On the flip side, the year’s greatest male leading performance was also painfully omitted. And one of the year’s greatest films was ignored completely. Academy voters, you’ve got some explaining to do. Forget Joaquin Phoenix and Adam Driver. The man who should be taking home that little bald gold man for Best Actor is Adam Sandler, who offers a revelatory performance in Uncut Gems that should have easily netted the actor his first Oscar nomination, let alone a rightful victory. An anxiety-inducing rollercoaster viewing experience that will truly have your heart racing, Uncut Gems is one of the most unnerving and strangely exhilarating films of recent times. Fast-talking New York jewellery store owner Howard Ratner (Sandler, in electric form) is a man in a constant state of chaos, which is seemingly just the way he likes it. A gambling addict with dreams of landing one big score, Howard thrives where others would falter. When he’s not busy fending off loan sharks and their hired goons, he’s juggling the anarchy that is his private life, shrewdly dividing his time between his semi-estranged wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and his ballsy young mistress Julia (a dazzling Julia Fox). While he continues hoping for his big payday, his shop appears to be doing relatively well, mostly thanks to his street-wise broker Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who leads a series of wealthy sports stars and musicians into Howard’s store in exchange for a cut of the sale. But the answer to all his prayers finally arrives when Howard gets his hands on a rare Ethiopian uncut black opal, which he plans to auction off for a small fortune. When NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (playing an exaggerated, self-deprecating version of himself) lays eyes on the football-sized rock in Howard’s store, he’s instantly smitten, believing the gem could be his new lucky charm for the upcoming finals series. Against his better judgement, Howard agrees to loan the uncut gem to the basketball star, setting off an inexplicable chain of events that quickly spiral out of control. Masterfully crafted by Josh and Benny Safdie, this is another dizzying creation from the brothers who are fast becoming two of the most electrifying filmmakers working today. Seeking to portray what it’s truly like to live life on the edge, Uncut Gems is purposely caustic and chaotic, as it constantly pushes the limits on just how much mayhem an audience can withstand. The Safdies drop the viewer right in the thick of Howard’s messy life, offering a film that’s often genuinely overwhelming, but therein lies the giddy fun. Filmed with such frenetic fashion by cinematographer Darius Khondji to truly capture the outlandish world of a gambler juggling too many balls at once, Uncut Gems is a heart-pounding endurance test for audiences, but one well worth experiencing. When the film appears to finally stop to take a breath, such as when Howard takes the night off to watch his daughter’s school play, there’s barely a moment before something turbulent happens to put the gambler right back in trouble. It’s a film that consistently threatens to lose complete control, but we’re in safe hands with the Safdie Brothers, who’ve proven to be masters of choreographing controlled mayhem, as seen in their break-out 2017 film Good Time. They have such a tight grip on this film, playing gleeful puppetmasters to a neverending nightmare that gets more outrageous as it barrels along. Whether it’s the swooping camerawork, the restless editing by Benny and Ronald Bronstein, or the pulsing synthesised score by Daniel Lopatin, the Safdies are in total command of every facet of this film. In a role he was clearly born to play, Sandler offers a career-defining nuanced performance that’s a complicated mix of bravado and vulnerability. Howard is a desperately disorganised mess of a man, constantly scheming his next move, while still attempting to escape his latest catastrophe. In the hands of a lesser performer, Howard would be entirely repulsive, but Sandler finds the pathos, offering a character that’s equal parts fascinating and frustrating. There are echoes of The Wolf of Wall Street‘s Jordan Belfort here, minus the endlessly luxurious lifestyle. It’s a frantic performance, born of Sandler’s necessity to portray Howard’s crippling gambling issues with an authenticity that will ring true to anyone with first-hand experience with the addiction. At times, you will beg Howard to just stop and take a damn breath, but it’s simply not in his nature. Howard thrives in this frenzied environment and there’s something strangely admirable about a man who lives for the win. He’s a product of his own making and failures, crafting a tragic character that elicits sympathy, even in the midst of some truly maddening narrative choices. Sandler’s performance is only elevated by a terrific ensemble cast, with Fox stealing focus at every turn in a breakthrough debut performance that suggests a bright future ahead for the young actress. When we first meet Julia, she appears to be nothing more than a stereotypical brainless bimbo who does as she’s told and suffers Howard’s negligence with like all good mistresses. But Fox is blessed with a character who’s far more than meets the eye, taking deft delight to unveil the true nature of her character in ways you won’t see coming. Without heading into spoiler territory, Uncut Gems leads to a lengthy climax that’s as tense as cinema gets. In the final five minutes, you genuinely will find yourself holding your breath and clutching your sweat-soaked palms. A total blast from start to finish, Uncut Gems is a riveting and engrossing portrait of a life lived to the limits. Its energy is unrelenting and its final impact is simply stunning. Strap yourselves in and enjoy this white-hot thrill ride. If anyone needed further proof the Safdie Brothers are auteurs in the making, they just knocked all doubt right out of the park.",POSITIVE
"Jan 29, 2020"," Una línea recta como una colonoscopia es la mejor manera de sintetizar la progresión hacia los más escarpados abismos del agobio que experimentan los protagonistas de las películas de los hermanos Safdie. En Diamantes en bruto, su obra más catedralicia hasta la fecha, a Howard Ratner ya se le presenta directamente con un prolongado plano detalle del interior de sus intestinos, imagen encadenada a partir del fulgor de una piedra preciosa recién excavada. Obviamente, se trata de una de las mejores presentaciones de personaje del cine reciente. Y es el único instante de calma antes de que se desate la brutal ciclogénesis de acontecimientos que sacudirá la vida de este joyero judío del Diamond District; ese tramo de la calle 47 con alta concentración de joyerías donde empezó a trabajar como recadero el padre de los directores cuando llegó a Nueva York, y entre cuya fauna ellos han encontrado una inagotable fuente de inspiración humana. En la tradición de personajes Safdie extraídos directamente de las aceras neoyorquinas, cuyo ambiente e idiosincrasia los hermanos plasman con una cercanía y veracidad inusuales en el cine estadounidense (que su forma favorita de rodar sea sin pedir permisos y con técnicas de cine de guerrilla también ayuda), Howard es un tipo irritante, excesivo, manipulador e irresponsable. Vende joyas y relojes que consigue por ahí o pide prestados, se endeuda para hacer apuestas deportivas de incierto pronóstico, camela a sus interlocutores con una incansable cacofonía de promesas y embustes, desatiende a su familia y mantiene una relación paralela con una empleada de su joyería; esencialmente, es un buscavidas que siempre confía en que la hipotética ganancia del próximo chanchullo le permita pagar las deudas de los anteriores, aunque también sabe que antes terminará reinvirtiéndola en pos de más. El capitalismo le ha enseñado a respirar así. Adam Sandler hace una interpretación colosal de Howard, encarnando perfectamente esa fusión entre caracter inaguantable pero entrañable que define a los protagonistas masculinos de los Safdie, del padre desastre que su guionista Ronald Bronstein interpretó en Go Get Some Rosemary (2009) al estresado Robert Pattinson de Good Time (2017), quien también sabía moverse únicamente hacia delante, sin importar las consecuencias más allá del plazo inmediato. Esa sensación de carrera a contrarreloj contra la ansiedad impulsa a empujones cada escena de Diamantes en bruto. La sensación de taquicardia inminente es potenciada por la nueva banda sonora omnipresente de Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) y los agitados planos cortos rodados en 35mm con teleobjetivo por Darius Khondji, tomando a la perfección el relevo de Sean Price Williams a la cámara. (el jugador de baloncesto Kevin Garnett haciendo de sí mismo). Pero ninguno de ellos, ni siquiera la gema más refulgente, luce como un Adam Sandler pletórico, desmedido, brillante. ¿Sabes cuándo fue la última vez que pasó eso? Con Embriagado de amor (2002). Otra obra maestra. Howard Ratner es el propietario de una exclusiva joyería situada en el barrio de los diamantes de la ciudad de Nueva York. Este establecimiento solo vende objetos a personas con mucho dinero. Sin embargo, un robo hará que deba enfrentarse a una deuda económica que no está preparado para afrontar.

"Jan 29, 2020"," Conforme las tendencias del cine de autor acentúan más el silencio y la sutileza, los hermanos Safdie se han distinguido con un cine cada vez más bestial en su velocidad de depredador y su ruido incesante. ¿Quién mejor que ellos, entonces, para contar una tragedia ligada a los excesos del mundo capitalista? Quizá —ojalá me perdonen el fanatismo— el productor ejecutivo de su última película, Martin Scorsese , pero su Lobo de Wall Street ( The Wolf of Wall Street , 2013) fue una sátira, motivada tal vez por un fraude financiero que sufrió en 2010. Diamantes en bruto (Uncut Gems, 2019), por el contrario, se trata de una inusual tragedia donde el mayor placer no está en comprender al personaje y sus motivaciones o en encontrar un símil de nuestro carácter, sino en acompañarlo a lo largo de su caída incandescente. En la realidad sería repugnante emocionarse con una historia como la de Howard Ratner ( Adam Sandler ), un joyero que hace una riesgosa apuesta mientras intenta vender un rarísimo ópalo negro al basquetbolista Kevin Garnett, y aunque es una obviedad que lo ficticio nos permite —o nos obliga— a emocionarnos aun ante las situaciones más crueles, se me ocurre esta idea por la forma en que se mezclan lo artificioso y lo realista en Diamantes en bruto . Aunque en la trama abundan inesperados giros, no me parecen una mera manipulación sino eventos lógicos en el mundo que nos presentan los Safdie . Como ya lo sugería, son los desastres y milagros en la vida de Howard los que nos describen su carácter y las consecuencias que le rebotan encima, para bien o para mal, como un balón de basquetbol. Una dirección más torpe revelaría la falsedad de una metáfora tan obvia pero los Safdie poseen un talento anormal para suspender la incredulidad, aunque retienen elementos más propios de una pesadilla. En Diamantes en bruto el tono onírico es más sutil que en filmes anteriores de los Safdie, como Heaven Knows What (2014) o Good Time (2017). Los colores neón aparecen en circunstancias más naturales y el mundo de la joyería neoyorquina es capturado como por un documentalista. Los Furbies enjoyados que vende Howard son tan grotescos y absurdos que sólo pueden parecernos reales, y detalles como la rigurosa entrada a su tienda, o su regateo con una casa de subastas sugieren una investigación extensa. De hecho, el juego de basquetbol que decide la suerte de Howard realmente pasó. En una entrevista con Cinema Scope los Safdie cuentan que el guión está escrito para Kevin Garnett y el juego de 2012 que ve Howard hacia el desenlace. Este compromiso con la realidad enmascara los artificios pero no los oculta del todo. En una escena Garnett y su cohorte se quedan atrapados en la puerta de seguridad de Howard. Los Safdie no sólo nos preparan con esto para el desenlace —ya los espectadores sabrán por qué— sino que aprovechan para explotar el alborotado tono de la película. Howard es seguido por la cámara mientras va y viene rápidamente para intentar solucionar el atasco; Garnett y su gente gritan encabronados, y Howard también, pero quizá decidido a irritar y, con ello, manipular a sus clientes. Las imágenes en movimiento constante, el ruido, los cortes, conspiran para alterar al espectador e involucrarlo, en caso de que el guión no le esté logrando por sí mismo. Si conseguimos distanciarnos, podremos ver el diestro manejo del lenguaje fílmico, pero los Safdie hacen todo lo posible por que su película nos trague. Considerando lo anterior, parecería que estoy describiendo Diamantes en bruto como efectista pero su intensidad trasciende por mucho las trampas del cine convencional. La excesiva dirección de los Safdie me parece subversiva, en ese sentido, y además inteligente por la forma en que complementa sus temas. La desgracia de Howard no sólo tiene una explicación en su carácter temerario sino en la codicia que provoca un mundo obsesionado con la posesión de objetos carísimos e innecesarios. La primera escena, que nos muestra a un trabajador herido en una mina en Etopía nos sugiere, por un lado, el precio real de conseguir los productos de Howard, pero también la maldición que conllevan. Quizá por coincidencia este preludio de Diamantes en bruto evoca los de El exorcista (The Exorcist, 1973) y Parque Jurásico (Jurassic Park, 1993), películas donde el colonialismo y el complejo de dios maldicen a los protagonistas y los intentan destruir, pero, juntos, sus preludios y sus temas apuntan a la destrucción que conlleva el poder. Ya para cerrar me parece importante discutir el acierto más grande de la película, en mi opinión: Adam Sandler . Su selección para el rol de Howard me parece importante porque quizás un rostro menos conocido no generaría tanto interés en el personaje. Cuando vemos a una estrella se produce una dualidad entre la celebridad real y la persona que interpreta, de tal modo que nos preocupan ambos. Pero además de esa ventaja emocional, Sandler hace una interpretación formidable de un ganador irritante. Su voz suena más nasal de lo acostumbrado y su volumen busca desesperarnos pero siempre desde el cálculo, es decir, Sandler sabe que Howard lo hace a propósito como herramienta de negociación o como la arrogancia impostada de un hombre que fanatiza su propia habilidad para ganar. Sin una actuación como la de Sandler, las tortuosas aventuras de Howard serían quizás insoportables: el retrato de un capitalista intrascendente. Pero gracias a él, a los Safdie y a su equipo tenemos con Diamantes en bruto una feroz fábula de un sistema tan voraz que se come a sí mismo.",POSITIVE
"Jan 26, 2020"," By now, you’ve seen the story countless times in reviews: during the 2019 TIFF premiere of Uncut Gems, someone from the crowd yells “Give An Oscar To The Sandman!” I attended this premiere and can confirm the love for Sandler was palpable. Sandler's less-to-be-desired film projects have made his career record spotty. Thankfully, the Safdie Brothers-directed Uncut Gems serves as a reminder that Sandler - when given the right material - can act with the rest of them. Set in NYC in 2012, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a jeweler with a serious gambling problem. Howard invests in an uncut black opal from Ethiopia, with the hopes of auctioning it for a lofty price. Juggling the auction, his crumbling marriage, and debt collectors, Howard faces the biggest bet of his life.  Uncut Gems fits perfectly within the Safdie Brothers universe of high stakes, high-stress films. Like their last lauded film, 2017’s Good Time, they take their time ramping up the drama up until the 3rd act. There’s a switch from “anticipation” to “panic” that makes you hold your breath, hoping for the moment of release. The brothers also pull double-duty, co-writing the script with Good Time collaborator Ronald Bronstein. The screenplay strikes the right balance between realistic - to the era and the New York backdrop - and gritty. The story has direction but you can tell personal touches were encouraged to give the film a raw, lived-in feel. But no one does this better than the film’s lead. Sandler delivers a great performance as Howard, invoking the calmness but chaos of a gambling addict. A smooth talker, Howard networks his way through bigger stakes, not caring about the consequences. Sandler has shown to be a great actor when in the right vehicles to showcase his talent - examples of those include Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories and Judd Apatow’s Funny People. Recent creative projects - in particular, his slew of Netflix films - haven’t highlighted his skill as an artist as they should. But with Uncut Gems, we get Sandler in his prime, giving him the space to flex his acting muscles and remind audiences of what he’s capable of. Time will tell if an Oscar will go to The Sandman but one thing’s for sure: Uncut Gems makes a case for consideration. It's a real, New York, thrilling story that captures your attention at the onset. And Sandler's performance raises the ante in the right ways, without getting close to folding.  MTR Premium Members can listen to Ro and Kriss give their spoiler review for Uncut Gems below.

"Jan 21, 2020"," Look closely at the start of the film and that universe turns before our eyes from the sparkling multicolours of the gemstone into Howard’s colon as he undergoes a medical procedure; and throughout the film his tunnel vision means he misses much of what’s around him, as we follow him on an adrenalin-fuelled snakes and ladders game across the city. Apparently it isn’t, but it could be. The quality of the product is entirely different – Howard may sell Furbys but they’re gold, diamond-encrusted ones – though there’s a parallel between both men, in that both seem determined to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, sabotaging their own lives in the process. Though Howard, it must be said, always takes high stakes to a new and elevated level. In the Safdie brothers’ hugely enjoyable if agitatingly tense tragicomedy, Howard’s tendency to always have his eye on the next prize, and refusal to call it quits when he’s ahead, could literally be the end of him. Sandler is glorious as a man whose addiction to massive bets has already destroyed his marriage to wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) to the extent that she calmly tells him “I hate looking at you, I hate being with you and if I had my way I would never see you again”. Their divorce is planned for after Passover, and until then they go through the motions of family life. Howard’s reverence for risk is matched only by his reverence for gemstones. His latest purchase is a rare black opal, mined by Ethiopian Jews; it’s a historical and cultural link for Howard that makes it even more attractive to him. The opal is still uncut when it arrives at his jewellery shop, where he delightedly shows it to Boston Celtics basketball player Kevin Garnett (playing himself), and allows Kevin to borrow it for one night to hopefully bring good luck in the game. Howard takes Kevin’s elaborate ring as collateral, immediately pawning it so he can place a bet. And this is Howard all over, pawning, paying, and playing people off against one another. Kevin refuses to give back the opal straight away as he loves it so much. He even tries to buy it but Howard has had a valuation for over a million dollars, and sends it to auction. This should be the big payday that will finally set Howard free from loan shark Arno to whom he owes one hundred thousand dollars. Meanwhile he continues to place huge bets on sports games, while having an affair with his young assistant Julia (Julia Fox). It’s a fine line he draws for himself, careering along a high wire with no safety net. While success would mean a massive victory and a huge payday and failure would mean the loss of everything, I don’t think that’s why he’s doing it. This life of glittering jewels, gambling and violence isn’t glamourised as Sandler paints a picture of a man who couldn’t live any other way and can only escape by running forwards. Not even the fear when Arno’s henchmen turn up at his daughter’s school play, or the humiliation of his estranged wife having to release him from his own car boot after he’s been shut in naked, is enough to give him pause. This is a joyous and tightly plotted frenetic thriller, and watching him became an addictive thrill for me too; partly because of its pace and twists, and partly because Sandler so expertly chips away at Howard’s brazen, seedy, thoughtless exterior to the broken family man within. Howard’s mistake is in rarely stopping long enough to see himself. Suddenly when it all quietens then we – and he – see the Broken Howard. His mistress is a gem, cheery and unfazed, and Fox imbues her with un-airbrushed sexiness and genuine warmth. In a story about rocks she’s the real deal.  They truly love each other but their relationship has the honestly and selfishness of children: “I’m really upset too” says Julia, looking at his tear-stained and beaten-up face. “I wish you were nicer to me” he replies, and, bereft of his next move, “I can’t figure out what I’m supposed to do”. The soundtrack is often chirpy ’80s synth, which goes well with the bright brashness and the 100-mile-an-hour lifestyle loved not just by Howard but many of the people he associates with, the noise and shouting and freaking-out reactions to anything and everything. It often looks like one big, noisy family. As we follow Howard, his bad decisions seem less like anything he has control over; in fact they don’t seem like decisions at all, but propulsion. His private and business lives are entwined; at one point he gets into a fight with The Weeknd because he thinks the singer is getting off with Julia. Not for nothing did I find myself whistling Tubthumping by Chumbawumba under my breath. This is a thrilling (on the surface) and melancholy (underneath) experience, watching one man bounce up and down, the likelihood of failure growing with each new choice. Note: one of the delights of Uncut Gems has been reading some of the articles and interviews around it, whether about its pop culture influences or its Jewishness (I am neither Jewish nor American). I loved Hannah Woodhead’s article for Vulture about the famous Furby and this from Heather Schwedel for Slate, where she interviews the Sadie Brothers about “making the most Jewish movie in years”.",POSITIVE

Si llegaron a ver “Good Time”, la película anterior de los hermanos Safdie, sabrán exactamente qué esperar de “Uncut Gems”. Así como dicha cinta tuvo como protagonista a un artista infravalorado, dispuesto a demostrar su rango actoral (Robert Pattison), en este caso tenemos a un Adam Sandler desatado, fuera de su zona de confort. Pero lo más importante es que “Uncut Gems” también es un ejercicio de tensión extrema, dos horas de adrenalina e incomodidad puras, en las que uno es testigo de los errores tremendos que puede cometer un hombre inmaduro, impulsivo, e irresponsable. No se trata de una experiencia convencionalmente “entretenida”, pero sí de un filme que no podré olvidar en un buen tiempo. “Uncut Gems” se lleva a cabo en el año 2012, y tiene como protagonista a Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), un neoyorkino judío dueño de una tienda de diamantes. Al comenzar la cinta, somos testigos del ritmo acelerado y caótico de su vida; los clientes entran y salen de su tienda, hablan al mismo tiempo, gritando y riendo, el teléfono suena casi todo el tiempo, y Howard utiliza tanto el dinero como los bienes que obtiene de la gente con la que trabaja, para realizar apuestas y pagar viejas deudas. Uno se va dando cuenta, desde un principio, que nuestro protagonista no es alguien especialmente responsable con sus finanzas o con su propio negocio. Y en casa las cosas están peor. Lo que desde afuera parece ser una vida familiar completamente normal, en realidad es algo bastante más problemática. Howard quiere a sus tres hijos, sí, pero está a punto de separarse de su esposa, Dinah (Idina Menzel). Y aunque se siente bastante feliz con su novia, la atractiva Julia (Julia Fox), se trata de una relación que parece pender de un hilo, al igual que el resto de su vida.  Desgraciadamente, las cosas no mejoran —cuando Howard logra conseguir una roca llena de ópalos multicolores, decide ponerla en subasta, como para ganar algunos miles de dólares y pagar sus deudas. Pero como nada en la vida de Howard es fácil, se verá involucrado con unos imponentes gángsters que quieren ver rodar su cabeza, y más importante, con el jugador de la NBA Kevin Garnett (haciendo de sí mismo), quien está obsesionado con la piedra, y su peligroso amigo Demany (LaKeith Stanfield). ¿Podrá Howard de verdad subastar su nueva adquisición? Y más importante; ¿podrá balancear su adicción a las apuestas con su vida familiar, profesional, y los adversarios que andan detrás de él? Ver “Uncut Gems” es una experiencia frenética; sí, la historia comienza de manera inesperadamente pausada, pero una vez que el conflicto principal es establecido y desarrollado, todo lo que uno hace es ver a Howard cometer error tras error, involucrándose con gente cada vez más peligrosa, arriesgando la estabilidad de su vida familiar y romántica. Howard es un personaje tremendamente complicado y vulnerable; es carismático, sí, pero a la vez incapaz de resistirse a las cosas que disfruta de la vida, como el dinero, las apuestas y el sexo. Verlo tomar decisiones, arriesgadas e irresponsables, es como ser testigo de un accidente vehicular sin poder hacer nada al respecto. Todo lo que le queda al espectador es simplemente ver el choque y rogar que nada malo le pase a los involucrados. La decisión de elegir a Adam Sandler como protagonista es simplemente brillante. Uno está acostumbrado a ver al infravalorado actor en comedias idiotas, siempre interpretando a hombres inmaduros e infantiles supuestamente “adorables”. Y aunque “Uncut Gems” es ciertamente más seria y complicada que cualquiera de sus propuestas más ligeras, su interpretación funciona precisamente porque se siente como una deconstrucción de sus personajes más populares: Howard es tan irresponsable y decadente como cualquiera de los protagonistas de sus comedias. La diferencia acá, es que sus actitudes tienen como consecuencias situaciones verdaderamente peligrosas. Cuando Sandler comete un error en sus comedias, lo peor que puede pasar es que alguien le grite, o que se lleve a cabo un gag particularmente estúpido. Pero cuando Howard comete un error, uno termina temiendo por su vida. Lo cual no quiere decir, por supuesto, que Sandler se haya dormido en sus laureles. De hecho, se puede argumentar que esta es la mejor actuación de su carrera. Con un aspecto bastante distinto al que nos tiene acostumbrados —chivita, peinado con gel, aretes en ambas orejas—, Sandler se convierte en Howard, otorgándole una palpable energía casi maniática para convertirlo en un hombre turbio, intenso, y a veces bienintencionado. Howard comete actos moralmente dudosos, pero a la vez, uno no puede evitar sentir que merece tener un final feliz. Las escenas que comparte con Julia Fox —inocente, valiente, completamente enamorada de Howard—, por ejemplo, demuestran que Howard tiene su corazoncito, y que hay gente que todavía lo aprecia, por alguna razón. A nivel visual, “Uncut Gems” se siente como una continuación de “Good Time”. Los Safdie hacen uso de una cámara siempre en movimiento, favoreciendo lentes largos, con fondos desenfocados, y un look granulado, lo cual hace que el filme se sienta como un producto de los 70s, pero con sensibilidades más contemporáneas. Tuve la suerte de ver “Uncut Gems” en el cine, con una proyección en celuloide de 35mm —a pesar de que se trata de una producción de Netflix, recomiendo que la vean en la pantalla grande. Se trata de una experiencia visual —con recorridos por el interior de gemas y piedras y ópalos, sensoriales y visualmente espectaculares— que definitivamente se aprovecha más en la pantalla grande. “Uncut Gems” es un ejemplo más de la libertad creativa que Netflix le está otorgando a directores que, de repente, no se sienten completamente cómodos trabajando con los grandes estudios de corte más tradicional. Se trata de una experiencia que me dejó exhausto —de un ejercicio de tensión y estrés que pone a prueba los nervios tanto del Howard de Adam Sandler, como de los miembros del público. Intensa y llena de momentos de inesperada violencia, “Uncut Gems” no es una película apta para todos; de hecho, estoy seguro que algunos espectadores podrían encontrarla demasiado frenética y cínica. Los demás, sin embargo, estoy seguro encontrarán algo único y memorable en esta cinta —así como una razón más para defender a Sandler, quien ha podido demostrar ya varias veces que puede ser algo más que un simple y desesperante comediante.",POSITIVE
"Jan 18, 2020"," Howard also has problems
at home: his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) is well aware that he’s set up his
mistress Julia (Julia Fox), who also works in his store, in an apartment in the
city, and he even drags his son (Jonathan Aranbayev) into the fraught
situation.  Not that his relationship with
Julia is any less troubled; when he suspects that she’s playing the field while
leading him on, he tosses her out—though not for long. In this midst of
everything that’s closing in on him, Howard has an escape plan.  He’s acquired a rock from an Ethiopian mine
that’s encrusted with gems, and intends to sell it a prestigious auction,
bringing in enough to cover his debts and then some.  Naturally things do not go as he’d planned. Sandler carries “Uncut Gems” with a ferocious performance.  It’s not that he’s departed from his well-known frantic, man-child persona; instead he’s taken it to its utmost—you could say that he’s gone Sandlerissimo.  But it’s certainly effective in this context.  And the Safdies (along with co-writer Ronald Bronstein (who also edited, with Benny) and cinematographer Darius Khondji, have crafted some excruciatingly tense sequences for him, not just the auction and the final stand-off with Arno and his men, but a sequence set at a school talent show where Howard is threatened by Arno’s enforcers.  They also generate considerable suspense )along with some dark comedy) in a familial Passover celebration where both Howard and Arno participate, watching one another warily, and effectively intercut some of Garnett’s actual NBA footage into the action.",POSITIVE
"Jan 17, 2020"," Just how much can a movie push your buttons before you shut down? How much screaming, arrogance, and impatience can it depict while refusing to even acknowledge any sort of moral core before it—just like its protagonist—ends up a shout into the void? Most filmmakers like to put a version of themselves into their movies, but Josh & Benny Safdie go by a different accord. Take a type of movie. Grind it down to its most basic parts, then coat it with mirrors until it fractals into psychosis. Glide between pastiche and starved, youthful energy, and then edit it until each jagged piece slides into a whole. Take that, squeeze a diamond out of it, and then leave the soot around the edges. Now you’ve got a main character in the form of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). Do it all again to a bigger extent and now you’ve got Uncut Gems. Both are imperfect, but as unit and vessel, they’re tailor-made for each other. He’s the kind of guy who wants to be a Scorsese character yet somehow managed to make it. He’s scrounging to keep up his act, sure, but he’s making it all the same. He bets on sports; he cheats on his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel). He sleeps with his jewelry associate and mistress, Julia (Julia Fox); he flaunts his winnings to his son, Beni (Jacob Igielski). Everything is a means to an end for him, and if he has to rip off some impoverished miners in the Third World to further his success, so be it. His latest conquest is an Ethiopian black opal that he snatched up for $100,000 with the intention of selling off for $1 million. It’s as dirty as it is lustrous, a fitting MacGuffin for the movie. It’s also a constant reminder of the arbitrariness at the center of it all. All of this for a rock? the Safdies seem to laugh about at points. Contrarily, their filmmaking is anything but haphazard, with the pair closely attuned to Howard’s brand of internal logic that flips between amusing and futile. Even if the script isn’t capital-D Deep, it cares about how it chases its own tail. The ingredients are all there. It’s the flavor, though, that keeps it running. Darius Khondji (Amour) has an attention to grain and depth, which takes Howard’s comparatively insipid quest and forces a professionalism upon it. If anything is ersatz here, it’s the use of neon and strobe effects that, in short bursts, scrape off the grit to remind audiences of the plastic that lies beneath. The editing from Ronald Bronstein and Benny Safdie, on the other hand, feels like it’s on the verge of catching fire at times, blending the directors’ coverage into what shouldn’t work. It does, however, and it makes for a cacophony so specific that its planning has to be commended. The script from Bronstein & the Safdies can take too many detours in the first half and its 2012 setting doesn’t provide many layers thematically, but when it has its eyes on the prize, it runs for it. But there is one prize that’s onscreen the whole time, and that’s Sandler’s performance. His neuroses, his swagger, the insecurities beneath the bling—they all bubble up more than a few times each, grounding what could have played solely as pastiche. There’s a very specific talent required to make such an obnoxious character watchable, and it’s a great role to remind audiences of his talents that, for whatever reason, only get plumbed about once every 10 years. It speaks to the synchronicity of Uncut Gems, too. It’s a bit too baggy at 135 minutes and the first third could have been tightened, but for all its flaws, it’s like that million-dollar rock. It’s wobbly and looks like it could crack at any moment, and that’s part of its charm. It also shines, and when it does, it shines blindingly bright. Cord-cutting once carried the promise of reducing live TV costs, but with most services nearing a $100 per month, that statement checks less every day. That said, there is a handful of cord-cutting services with reasonable monthly prices. Below we list them.

"Jan 16, 2020"," Current talk of the town Uncut Gems has one of the great opening sequences of last decade. In a mining camp, a group of Ethiopian Jewish miners strikes gold — well, rare black opal. Right now, a 95x36mm one of these prized gemstones is going for $3,000 on Etsy. An apparent price drop. Sheesh.  As for the black opal our miners find, there’s barely enough time to sit with the discovery, or what it means, before we’re transported into the heart of the gem. 70s synth sounds pace a psychedelic odyssey. And on the other side, a GI doc cruises through Howard Ratner’s (Adam Sandler) innards in the midst of a colonoscopy. I haven’t seen a more imaginative introduction to a hero or his story in quite some time.  But it’s not just the distinctive visual storytelling and editing (especially sound editing) that stands out in the Safdie brothers’ latest feature. It’s the tension. And I’m not just talking run of the mill tension. In every scene, the anxiety meter is turned up to the max. Tension is mined for everything its worth. Josh and Benny Safdie have made a simple buzzer dramatic — and possibly even traumatizing — in the same way that Peele shook everyone with stirring tea. A few miles due north of Wall Street, Ratner plays a jeweler in New York City’s Diamond District. It’s hard to say he’s a complete failure. Ratner has the upper middle class totems of a Manhattan apartment, where his mistress Julia (newcomer Julia Fox) crashes, and a house in the burbs with his soon to be ex-wife Dinah Ratner (Idina Menzel) and kids. On the other hand, he seems to owe everyone money, conducting business layaway style; he’ll pawn off an heirloom to pay off some guys on Tuesday, even if it means having to manifest even more cash to pay back his lifeline by Thursday.  As a newcomer to the Safdie’s work, it took a little while to get adjusted to their early scenes. After his colonoscopy, Ratner returns to work at his jewelry store, a cacophonous tightly packed outfit where everyone seems to be talking and demanding something of him. This quickly and smartly establishes Ratner as a leader and an authority. He juggles a lot and the audience is required to walk this tightrope as well, dealing with the many mechanics involved in the day in the life of a jeweler who doesn’t exactly operate above board. It feels real and raw, and somehow not gimmicky, and I was slowly seduced into starting to root for this unlikely hero. One day, that prized black opal from Ethiopia shows up at Ratner’s shop and just in the nick of time. Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who has ties to the hoops and hip hop world, intros NBA all-timer Kevin Garnett who’s come to see Ratner’s stuff. Later, rapper The Weeknd, born of Ethiopian parents, also makes a cameo. Uncut Gems, by the way, takes place in the early 2010s. KG is in the midst of a playoff series against the Elton Brand era Philadelphia 76ers, and is looking for a new good luck charm.  Ratner isn’t really an inquisitive man, but he lights up as he talks about the history of the gem and how he played the long game to nab it. Maybe it’s even worth millions. All he knows is that it will change his fate. KG is touched by it too and convinces Ratner to loan it to him for a game. In exchange, Ratner borrows KG’s hallowed Boston Celtics ‘08 championship ring. Soon, a past his prime player’s resurgent game (credit the gem) sparks another Ratner scheme. Go all in on Kevin Garnett in the world of sports betting. I’ve noted how it’s been a while since I’ve seen a hoops movie or television treatment that shows extended scenes of actual basketball. Usually the depiction doesn’t focus on the actual game played on the beautiful parquet. Well the genre-bending Uncut Gems finally gives us hoops fans something to cheer about. Ratner (and Brooklyn native and Knicks fan Sandler) somehow becomes a Celtics fan for a week or so, desperately watching games at his apartment, in a bar, on his phone when he should be reading to his kid in bed, and ultimately, even when looking down the barrel of a gun.  Uncut Gems really nails the anxiety involved in watching sports, and the joy. But while this investment can come from being a noble fan rooting for their home team, there are so many other ways to have skin in the game. Ratner’s final bet to end all bets, an almost farcical affair where more than two dozen things need to go right for his big payday, speaks to the current state of the NBA and its obsession with number-crunching analytics. The Safdies also somehow make high dramedy out of the 2012 Eastern Semis, where whoever advanced was sure to get trounced by Lebron and Wade’s Miami Heat. And of course, the filmmakers wouldn’t be righteous Knicks fans without a dig at owner James Dolan.  While Ratner juggles bets and avoiding the many goons who come to collect, he also deals with home and family life. Julia is painted kind of thinly at first, but later reveals that she knows a lot more than she lets on. There’s an especially fun scene where Ratner, always the goofball, arrives home early and hides before Julia enters. They begin phone sex, when all of a sudden Ratner jumps out from hiding and surprises her.  Outside of the city, Ratner tries to rekindle things with Dinah, who has her heart set on a divorce. He keeps delaying it, not above using Passover seder as an excuse for why they should present a united front for longer. And when Ratner gives his hail mary speech, telling Dinah that he’s a changed man, the reaction is surprising. Laughter. She doesn’t even undress him in a didactic or expositional way for the audience’s benefit.  No attempt to redeem. Just laughter. But while Uncut Gems wisely avoids being heavy-handed with Ratner’s internal struggle at some points, in others, it doesn’t feel like it digs deep enough. When Ratner is at his lowest, fresh off his worst whooping to date, he finally breaks down in front of Julia. To be sure, this vulnerability is significant and shows change. But to me, the breakdown felt more ostentatious and performative, and just as non self-reflective as he was at every other point in the film. At this point, I think I expected a more quiet and honest insight from him about exactly what he wants and why he wants it. Similarly, there were times when my anxiety levels felt so high that I felt more manipulated than thrilled or satisfied. While the drama that came from Ratner’s own doing was usually believable and compelling, the drama that came from, say that protracted buzzer scene, just felt like our strings were being pulled. And more to the point, it seemed like a departure from exploring the theme of someone being their own worst enemy. Storytelling is about contrast and emphasis, but if the dial is always turned up, some viewers might just shut down, having felt bludgeoned. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," At first glance, 1917 seems a strange film, a First World War picture that arrives three years too late for a centenary, three months too late for Remembrance Day, and where there is some considerable doubt about whether any of the extraordinary events it depicts actually happened. And yet it has just won the Golden Globe for Best Drama, picked up another for director Sam Mendes and secured no fewer than nine Bafta nominations. That’s definitely pretty good going for a film not so much based on the stories handed down by Mendes’s novelist grandfather, Alfred, who enlisted at the age of 19, but certainly inspired by them. Telling the story of two very ordinary lance corporals dispatched on a desperate mission behind enemy lines to prevent a massacre of British troops, it is an astonishing and, at times, quite dazzling piece of film-making. The first ten minutes – when it becomes clear that Mendes intends to follow Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) in what appears to be one single, film-long shot – take your breath away, as Roger Deakins’s tireless camera follows the men from a green and pleasant field behind the lines into the muddy, sandbag-lined chaos of the trenches. Even at this early stage, it’s impossible not to be hugely impressed by what’s on the screen – not just the ingenious camera work (look out for the moment when the camera appears to float across a flooded shell-hole) but the hundreds of yards of authentic-looking trenches that appear to have been dug, the immaculate production design, the marshalling of the extras and, of course, the almost invisible visual effects that bring the serial horrors of the battlefield – and no man’s land in particular – so vividly and realistically to life. Such is Mendes’s pulling power these days that Colin Firth is the first of several eminent actors who pop up in minor roles (Andrew Scott, Mark Strong and Benedict Cumberbatch are others), with Firth playing the general who knows that the Germans’ apparent retreat is in fact a trap.  Unless Blake and Schofield can get a message to the 2nd Devons, two battalions of men could be wiped out. Including, in something of a Saving Private Ryan-like twist, Blake’s brother.  Make no mistake, this is a film that is going to win lots of awards and will certainly be among the front-runners at the Oscars. But that doesn’t make it perfect – I wasn’t particularly moved by it, which, given the emotive subject matter, is fairly extraordinary.  And part of the reason for that, I believe, is that I was constantly distracted by all the ‘film-making’ so obviously going on. For the record, there are cuts in the seamless-looking narrative; it’s just that they are cleverly hidden. There’s a real danger that you’re so busy admiring the technical ‘craft’ that you forget to immerse yourself in the story Mendes co-wrote with the relatively inexperienced Krysty Wilson-Cairns.  Yes, there are moments of great tension, but there are also moments, amid much sprinting through ruined villages, when it comes perilously close to a point-of-view video game.  Wearing a succession of tantalisingly short but no doubt historically authentic outfits, Kristen Stewart certainly looks the pretty part as Jean Seberg, the gamine actress for ever associated with the 1960 French nouvelle vague film Breathless, but who actually hailed from America’s Midwest. But she never quite disappears into the role, hampered by director Benedict Andrews’s highly visual style and by a screenplay that certainly grabs our attention but eventually fails to do full justice to its shocking and very sad underlying story. Nearing 30 and with her marriage to the French novelist Romain Gary already struggling, Seberg returns to Los Angeles in the troubled summer of 1968, meeting the black activist Hakim Jamal (Anthony Mackie) on the plane.  They begin an affair and she pledges her financial support for his radical civil rights campaign, little knowing that the FBI is watching – and recording – her every move. Stewart, clearly identifying with the vulnerable and much-wronged actress, gives it her best shot as Seberg, but it’s never quite enough in an uneven film that raises more questions than it answers and, at a more fundamental level, just never really convinces. Adam Sandler is an annoying actor at the best of times, but here he’s obviously been specially chosen to play a really annoying character: a Jewish New York jeweller aggressively trying to bluff and haggle his way out of financial trouble – in a film that has clearly set out to be really annoying too.  In some quarters this has been declared some sort of minor masterpiece. Me, I’d say it’s hard to imagine a more uncomfortable way of spending over two hours in the cinema and advise you to avoid it, shock ending and all. Mark Addy and Tara Fitzgerald may head the cast list but what you need to know about Richard Heap’s debut feature is that Addy’s character – a former fisherman who now runs the donkey rides on Whitby beach – bows out after barely 15 minutes, while Fitzgerald is an even more token-feeling presence at the end. In between, in a film plagued by an uneven pace and even more uneven tone, the action belongs to the three children who run away after their father’s death and improbably take two of their donkeys with them. ",NEGATIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," The Adam Sandler awards film has arrived: Sandler is Howard Ratner, a dodgy New York jeweller with a gambling problem, whose Diamond District business attracts buyers from all walks of life. Howard is in deep with the wrong people. He’s struggling to pay his debts and his marriage, too, is in trouble. Then one day, Howard hits it big. The bloke has somehow managed to acquire a black opal still embedded in rock, from an African mine; an ‘uncut gem’, which he claims is worth $1m. He plans to auction it to pay off his debts, but first, he must contend with Kevin Garnett, the American basketball player, who pops into Howard’s store and develops an obsession with the gem. Against his better judgement, Howard allows Kevin to hold on to the opal for one day. You can probably see where this is going. Long story short, all hell breaks loose when Howard is informed that Kevin is in no rush to return the gem. Meanwhile, Howard loses more money, his marriage crumbles, his mistress gets cosy with a famous singer, the loan sharks come in thick and fast, the auction goes sideways, and our boy has the most stressful 48 hours of his life.

An unflinching Sandler — a marvellous dramatic actor, who has spent too much of his career punching below his weight — is mesmerising as a sleazy jeweller, who refuses to acknowledge the magnitude of his mistakes. Indeed, Uncut Gems plays by its own rules. It never shuts up. It unravels and explodes like a thrilling gangster flick on steroids, and I must admit, my anxiety levels went through the roof while watching it. If you can handle the onslaught, you’re in for the ride of your life. A fabulous, uncompromising piece of cinema.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," Adam Sandler is synonymous with comedy, and love 'em or hate 'em comedy at that. However, his turn to dramatic acting is proving only loved. His turn in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories was wonderful and here in the Safdie brothers' frenetic, exhausting drama he once again turns in a fantastic performance. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a New York jeweller. From the beginning there is a sense of a man who has pushed everything - his marriage, his career, his finances, absolutely everyone's patience and goodwill - to the limit and he has one chance to claw it all back. This chance is a rock containing raw black opals which he will sell for an enormous profit. A lot goes on around a man who lives by the seat of his designer pants and never gives up despite his endless self-sabotage. He has an angry wife (Idina Menzel) in the suburbs, a girlfriend he mistrusts in the city (Julia Fox), a brother in law to whom he owes money (Eric Bogosian) and a basketball player, Kevin Garnett playing himself, who wants the opals. Ratner is nowhere near as odious as he should be and this is in large part due to Sandler wringing out nuances. It's a loud, sweary, stressful watch and it is really very good. We are all suspicious now of officialdom, but 50 years ago most people believed that governments and agencies like the FBI were a force for good. To have been suspicious of them must have seemed unhinged, which doubled their power over anyone they targeted. Actress Jean Seberg was one such FBI target when she openly supported the Black Panthers in 1969, and Benedict Andrews's film (screenplay by Anna Waterhouse and Joe Shrapnel) tells that story. Lance corporals Schofield (George MacKay) and Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) are called in to a private meeting with General Erinmore (Colin Firth). They are tasked with a mission to leave their trench in northern France and venture far into enemy territory in order to hand-deliver a vital order halting a planned assault on German forces. If they manage to make it in time and get the order through to superiors, they will have prevented some 1600 soldiers from walking into a deadly trap. The concept of two impossibly young men being saddled with such a terrifying and impossible responsibility is compelling to consider, as is the scale of the horror their generation were made wade through. The enemy remains a largely faceless threat, with director Sam Mendes's screenplay (drawn from his own grandfather's account and co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns) concentrating on the personal ordeal of the two heroes, one of whom has added incentive by way of a brother posted among the endangered 1600. The imperative nature of the mission is underscored by extensively long single-takes courtesy of cinematography genius Roger Deakins as the two men set off into their own real-life Mordor. Time is surely of the essence, you'd assume, in this lavish, wide-screen cousin of Saving Private Ryan and (less so) Dunkirk. It is and it isn't, it turns out. While astounding as a feat of production, there are issues with 1917's pacing. Sometimes the desire to make things as immediate and realistic as possible can have the opposite effect, and 1917 is such a case. The gimmick of its ultra-long takes makes the fortunes of its two protagonists seem fanciful and strangely episodic, as if they are computer avatars completing a series of levels. They go from one remarkable incident to the next, mostly, it appears, in real-time in a manner that robs the tale of credibility and loosens our grip on the characters. A Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture (Drama) is thus surprising for a film that works best when it takes its focus away from Schofield and Blake and loses itself in extravagant set piece.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," War is hell. Except when the flares of its doomed participants catch the ruined buildings at night, casting long expressionist shadows that caress the screen like Nosferatu’s fingers. That would seem to be the message of Sam Mendes’s First World War drama 1917, which is somewhere between a war film and a collection of the most eye-catching screensavers ever knitted together for general release.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020",Let's just say that Uncut Gems is a heck of a ride.,POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," Early on in this ferociously involving New York thriller, gem merchant and gambling addict Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) sets eyes on a black opal and groans: “Holy shit, I’m gonna come!” Later he writhes with delight in the back of a cab when he realises a sports bet has paid off. Success can go to a man’s head. Howie’s good fortune goes straight to his loins. Daniel Day-Lewis apparently loves Sandler’s sexy-scuzzy performance. Of course he does. Day-Lewis’s wife Rebecca Miller appeared opposite Sandler in The Meyerowitz Stories (2017). Day-Lewis’s favourite director, Paul Thomas Anderson, cast Sandler in Punch-Drunk Love (2002). If you’ve seen either of these films, you won’t need telling that the king of low-brow comedy is a seriously good thesp. Still, a lot of people need persuading. When the Oscar nominations are announced, Sandler is widely expected to be one of the candidates for best actor. The odds of him winning the award, though, are 25/1. Howard would adore those odds. It’s 2012, and over the course of the movie he tries to capitalise on the preciousness of his opal, eventually making a bet-to-end-all-bets, involving superstitious NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself, with aplomb). If his gamble works, Howard will be able to pay off a $100,000 debt to his loan shark brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian, whose eyes emit silent screams). It will also impress Howard’s flighty mistress Julia (newcomer Julia Fox; bound for stardom) and bitter wife Dinah (Idina Menzel). Not to mention all the people in the universe who think Howard’s a pushy moron and a “crazy Jew”. The film’s young directors, Josh and Benjamin Safdie, are Jewish. They say they deliberately made Howard “aggressive” because they’re tired of seeing Jewish characters who are “nebbish or a little bit weak”. That’s a direct challenge to Woody Allen, whose Jewish heroes are invariably timid hypochondriacs, but it’s also an up-yours to directors like Guy Ritchie who, in The Gentlemen, serves up a Jewish villain both weedy and greedy. The Safdies take anti-Semitic tropes and rework them in a way that challenges racism. If this film has a message, it’s that all capitalists are rapacious. The Safdies, by the way, have an experimental streak. They opt for a manically spaced-out electronic score, shock edits and cinematography that makes grand things look grubby and vice versa. Their vision is bracingly nostalgic; the city, here, is a palimpsest of Scorsese’s New York (Scorsese’s not being robbed; he executive-produced the film). Though there are nifty set-pieces galore, the most memorable concern the glass ante-chamber that protects Howard’s showroom from the corridor outside — a claustrophobic (and, as it turns out, often malfunctioning) enclosure which seems designed to turn all visitors into gibbering wrecks and/or make them as angry as Hannibal Lecter. It’s just a shame that Uncut Gems short-changes Menzel and totally wastes the sublime Lakeith Stanfield (as Howard’s unofficial assistant). Meanwhile the ending, though undeniably tense, is somewhat generic. And sentimental. Howard is a fan of mystical connections and, in a rush of rhetorical fervour, claims kinship with Garnett. The film’s final moments suggest Howard and Garnett do, indeed, have a uniquely profound bond. Nice try, but that feels like a bromantic fantasy. US critics deem this quite the big gem. Having looked at it closely, I’d say it’s being over-valued. But not by much.",POSITIVE
"Jan 14, 2020"," It is rare that a film as relentlessly propulsive and uniquely gripping as Uncut Gems comes along - probably about as rare and mesmerising as the uncut opal around which a lot of the action centres in this high-octane thriller. From acclaimed sibling filmmaking duo Josh and Benny Safdie, who were behind the excellent 2017 crime drama Good Time starring Robert Pattinson, Uncut Gems similarly thrives on chaos and a mounting sense of stress that verges on panic-inducing. Adam Sandler is fully immersed in the role of Howard Ratner, a fast-talking Manhattan diamond district jeweller who funds his compulsive gambling habit with increasingly high stakes dodgy dealings. He's a hundred grand in the hole with Arno (Eric Bogosian), a sinister loan shark who also happens to be his brother-in-law, and has pinned all his hopes on making the money back by auctioning off an uncut black opal smuggled in from Ethiopia. The gem promises to be more trouble than it's worth. When Howard's middleman Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) brings in NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (playing himself) to the store, the basketballer becomes obsessed with its supposed auspicious properties. He insists on taking it as a good-luck omen for an upcoming match and leaves Howard with a valuable ring as collateral. So begins an increasingly high-wire act where Howard must juggle making progressively outlandish bets and smooth-talking the knuckle-cracking goons on his tail, all the while navigating his complicated family life. Sandler puts in a career-best performance as the wheeler-dealer who operates under levels of stress and worry unimaginable to anyone else. Idina Menzel has a smaller but no less impactful role as Howard's estranged wife Dinah, while newcomer Julia Fox is magnetic as his employee and girlfriend Julia. The Safdie brothers have built a whole world for these characters to live in - garishly painted and crackling with tension. The non-stop chatter and overlapping dialogue create a sense of pandemonium that leaves your head swimming, but in the best possible way. It's an endlessly nerve-wracking, visceral assault of a movie that will leave you exhilarated and probably more than a little relieved to be exiting the cinema. © RTÉ 2024.

"Jan 14, 2020"," The title sequence of Uncut Gems opens on the depths of a fine black opal, penetrated to observe lightning flashes of Day-Glo orange and green. This fades into the smooth, gray-pink walls of a human colon during a colonoscopy. Tonight, we're going to see an asshole thoroughly probed. In the role of Howard Ratner (asshole and rat), Adam Sandler has a certain fascinating yet monotonous drive. He's Howie, a terminal hustler with colossal gambling debts. He's also an NYC Diamond District salesman, who caters to the kind of thug-life clientele whose quarrel-prone, armed entourages would scare off most dealers. The more top-drawer names in hoops and hip-hop are led to Howie by his pilot fish (Lakeith Stanfield), where they're beguiled by watches that cost 20 grand, and diamond-studded trinkets such as a miniature Furby whose eyes swivel. Through shifty means, Howie acquires the opal we see in the title shot: a million-dollar score, obtained from exploited Ethiopean Jewish miners. In a moment of chatty foolhardiness Howie shows the opal to Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett (playing himself). Garnett wants it and takes it, no matter what trouble it causes for Howie. Directors Josh and Benny Safdie have the advantage of considerable forward motion, as well as the Hitchcockian law that we won't judge a lowlife as long as he's good at his game. Any given movie audience today is at least half-full of debtors, so Uncut Gems has a hook they'll feel. It's sins of the flesh that get Howie. Julia (Julia Fox), who works with him, is the standard film noir girl—crude, hot but totally decent; obedient as a sexbot and tough enough to resist the hand that tries to sweep her away. Her willingness for everything is a contrast to Dinah (Idina Menzel), Howie's Jewish empress of a wife, who is waiting until after Passover to file for divorce. Menzel is primarily a stage actress, and they haven't yet made a movie that she doesn't overpower. Uncut Gems can be read as an ethnic story, a tale of the punishment that a Chosen Person can expect for straying. This is underscored in a Passover litany of the plagues unleashed by He Who Shall Not Be Named. Maybe I'm too gentile to get Uncut Gems, but I'd counter-accuse people who didn't turn up for the Coen Brothers' A Serious Man because they heard it was all about Jewish self-loathing. Compared to this? The movie winds up with a final hustle, in which the loan sharks (Eric Bogosian and Keith Williams Richards) are trapped in a glass security booth. Aesthetically speaking, it's like standing outside that prime rib place in San Francisco where you can watch the sides of beef aging through the glass windows. The Safdies have talent, and if they'd cut this uncut gem they'd get closer to the work they're emulating—Sidney Lumet's Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, for example. Photographer Darius Khondji makes the work fevered and appropriately opalescent. Let's see what they do next. Hopefully it's something where they aren't contractually obligated to remind you that the protagonist is a mensch every five minutes.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 13, 2020"," The Safdie brothers, Josh and Benny, once programmed a season of films entitled Emotional Sloppy Manic Cinema, and if sloppy is subtracted from that description, it’s a pretty accurate summation of their work here in Uncut Gems. This is edge-of-the-seat filmmaking, with vertiginous camerawork by Darius Khondji and a relentless, immersive soundscape of electronica and layered dialogue. Adam Sandler, transformed with false teeth and a dazzling selection of designer shirts and shades, plays Howard Ratner. He’s a compulsive gambler and jewellery dealer who sells diamond encrusted Furbies and dodgy Rolexes to stars from the world of sport and music. Ratner's also a family man who has been cheating on his ferocious wife (Idina Menzel, a long way from Elsa in Frozen) with a pneumatic floozy (Julia Fox) who works in his Diamond District store. Once Passover is done, he plans to tell his kids he’s getting a divorce.  Ratner owes money everywhere; to his brother-in-law, Arno (played by Eric Bogosian with all the icy cool of Robert Mitchum) and to assorted loansharks who chase him down, even at his daughter’s high school drama. Over the course of a few days, Ratner tries to pull off one spectacular bet on a big basketball game, funded by his belief that a black opal, he’s had smuggled in from Ethiopia will fetch $1m at auction. Augmenting Sandler’s image-changing performance are fine turns from Lakeith Stanfield (above centre), whose job it is to bring basketball player Kevin Garnett (left), here playing a version of himself, and musicians, including rapper The Weeknd to the jewellery store. Subtle swipes are taken at the obsession with bling and the exploitation of the black miners who sweat for the precious stones. There’s a fascinating essay to be written on the Safdie brothers fearless take on Jewish and African-American stereotypes, but this probably isn’t the place for it. In their portrayal of family loyalties and suppurating rivalries, there are echoes of what Martin Scorsese did for Italian-American gangsters in Goodfellas and The Irishman. In Howard Ratner, the Safdies have created a character who is both fully rounded and wholly reprehensible. ",POSITIVE

"Jan 13, 2020","  Winner of best drama and best director at the Golden Globes last weekend, Sam Mendes’ new film 1917 builds on a story his soldier grandfather told him about fighting on the Western Front and expands it into a race-against-time action film about the fragility of human life. Set in Northern France over the course of a few frantic hours, the film follows a pair of soldiers tasked with delivering an urgent message to a British battalion about to walk into a German trap, with Mendes reinforcing the urgency of the theme by shooting the movie in two simulated single takes divided by a midpoint blackout that allows the film to transition from daylight to pre-dawn the following day.   It’s a technique that was used brilliantly in Birdman a few years ago, though Mendes – who road-tested the single-take action sequence with the opening scene of Spectre – arguably set himself, co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns and genius cinematographer Roger Deakins a bigger challenge by having this story take place almost entirely outdoors, with protagonists negotiating the ravaged landscape of war-torn France. Appropriately enough, the film wastes no time plunging us into the horrors of war – not with a big battle scene, but with its eerie aftermath as Lance Corporals Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay) are ordered to travel across no-man’s land and behind enemy lines to deliver crucial intel to British forces who think they’ve got the enemy on the run.   In lieu of a visible enemy, Mendes ratchets up the tension here by having Blake and the Somme-scarred Schofield learn quickly that barbed wire and rats might prove just as fatal as gunfire if they’re not careful. Yet, having explored the detrimental psychological effect of inaction on battle-ready professionals in his Gulf War drama Jarhead, he also examines the flip side of this by having these young men – who barely look older than boys – encounter various battle-hardened and higher-ranking soldiers who’ve been ground down or dehumanised by this war of attrition. Andrew Scott is the stand-out among the many big name actors recruited for cameos (Colin Firth, Benedict Cumberbatch and Richard Madden also appear) and far from these being distracting, they help shoulder the weight of a story that sits a little uneasily at first on its young leads. Chapman, especially, struggles to match his acting style to the harrowing realism the film demands, though MacKay does have the haunted look of those young soldiers staring out of the screen in Peter Jackson’s They Shall Not Grow Old documentary and, as the film progresses, he seems to grow into the role the more urgent his character’s mission becomes. Though the second half’s somewhat theatrical transition into more mythic territory isn’t quite as gripping, as the film pushes on towards its Gallipoli-like climax, the tension returns and Mendes pitches the ending just right, capturing the shellshocked emotional toll of war on those all too familiar with its devastating impact.   Outstripping 1917 for sheer nerve-jangling tension is Uncut Gems. This latest arthouse thriller from New York auteurs Josh and Bennie Safdie (Good Time) stars Adam Sandler as a diamond dealer on a chaotic downward spiral as he tries to pull off the deal of his life (it involves selling an uncut black opal he’s imported from an unregulated Ethiopian mine). A compulsive gambler who seemingly spends every waking second making deals to offset his debts, the film zeroes in on a few days of his life as he negotiates the imminent implosion of his marriage, the stress of his relationship with his much younger mistress, the debt collectors who are starting to demand payment in ever more violent ways, and his own inability to stop himself making crazy bets on the basketball play-offs he’s obsessed with. The Safdies have a real skill at capturing the sights and sounds of New York with overlapping dialogue, documentary style camera work and naturalistic performances from a cast of stars and non-professionals alike, but they jack things up in intriguing ways – with Daniel Lopatin’s swirling synth score adding a surreal edge and an early 2010s period setting allowing them to build the film round a real series of basketball games (they even recruit the NBA player at the centre of them, Kevin Garnett, to play himself in a major role). The end result is frantic but carefully constructed filmmaking, full of little details that have big pay-offs later on. And Sandler really is astonishing. Described in the film by his wife (played by Idina Menzel) as the most annoying person she’s ever met, his character is maddening yet oddly sympathetic. Even as he’s behaving badly, it’s hard not to root for him.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2020"," DO you remember the sketch in The Fast Show where a family – led by a frantically screaming father – would be charging across airport terminals or train platforms? That anxiety, that sheer lead-in-your-stomach lurch has been encapsulated in film format in the most tense and stressful 135 minutes you’ll have for a long time. It is also totally fantastic. This crime thriller from the Safdie brothers stars Adam Sandler –  NO, WAIT . . . COME BACK! HE’S BRILLIANT IN THIS – as jeweller Howard Ratner, a man who is the epitome of someone who “lives on their nerves”. A chronic gambling habit has put him up to his ears in debt, with a string of heavies queuing up for their pound of flesh. His marriage is in tatters, and his relationship with his mistress – shacked up in his bachelor pad – is not faring much better. All his hopes, and his future relationship with his limbs, rely on him getting a decent price for a rare black opal he has dodgily imported from ­Ethiopia. If it gets the $1million he expects, great. If not, well . . . It goes missing and so begins the cat and mouse story that left me having to go to the toilet just to catch a breath. It is extraordinary and unlike any film I’ve seen in years. Sandler is incredible and the New York portrayed here is about as far from the glamour of Hollywood-style Manhattan as you can get – there is no Woody Allen romanticism. If the fear looks genuine, it probably has something to do with real blood being spilled. Sounds such as doorbells are used to infuriating effect, building up this film from a twitchy start to a whirlwind last half-hour that has you gripped.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2020"," Benny and Josh Safdie, aka the Safdie brothers, are quickly defining themselves as crown jewels of New York cinema, who can go toe to toe and pound for pound with the greats.  Uncut Gems marks their follow up to their critically acclaimed film Good Time, starring Robert Pattison. There’s a spontaneity and vitality to Uncut Gems that feels totally improvised, but make no mistake it’s a finely crafted structure; a diamond through and through.  It might have something to do with the Safdies spending a decade honing the script, distilling it down to its absolute purest form. But somehow even this explanation doesn’t cut it. It’s more likely the result of some mysterious unseen process, that’s nothing short of cinematic alchemy. Uncut Gems is an incendiary display of virtuoso, acid-soaked filmmaking. It seems to have been born straight out of the head of Zeus, like a bolt of lightning. The film follows a full-tilt day in the life of jeweller, and chronic high-stakes gambler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). There’s a wild glisten in Howard’s eye, a yearning ambition that seems unfathomable in its scope. As Howard traverses the New York diamond district, we’re brought into the sphere of his world.  His working and domestic lives are an interconnected mess, and where one ends and the other begins is impossible to discern.  He settles bets. Trades bets. And pawns goods, only to place more bets. He’s separated from his wife. But has a lover at work. But he has to see his kids. And then, of course, he’s up to his neck in debt. But the values of his relationships rise and crash from moment to moment. It’s a perpetual hell-like dynamic, and his soul’s split in two, as he struggles to balance his insatiable desire, with his paternal responsibilities.  But when Howard’s violently beaten by debtors, he pawns anything and everything, and lays down the bet of a lifetime; and everything hangs in the balance. The Safdie’s have capitalized on the spiritual essence of Sandler, and utilized it in a way that casts aside any doubters. And Sandler is riveting, his anxious charisma and beating heart have never been this finely tooled.  He grounds Howard with a humanity, and an existential longing which rages through his heart and drives his destabilizing lifestyle. This is the defining performance of Adam Sandler’s career, it’s a masterclass in acting that utilizes his talent to hypnotizing effect.  The cast is rounded out with a wealth of talent including Indina Menzel, Eric Bogosian, Judd Hirsch and NBA superstar Kevin Garnett. The Safdie’s turn the New York diamond district into a vista of fluorescent and neon-soaked horror. Their vision is crystallized by the inimitable genius of legendary cinematographer Darius Khondji, who wields his camera and lighting with ferocious honesty. There’s a heightened naturalism and reality to everything that feels more like a documentary. Every second within the frame there’s a tension that anything can happen, and it does; life unfolds, at a dizzying gymnastic pace. This is complemented with a score courtesy of the Safdies’ regular collaborator Daniel Lopatin. His punchy dance score is a battle of beating synthesizers and brass that are moulded and cast to euphoric effect.  Between the sonic insanity of uncategorizable beats, there’s an impenetrable loneliness that’s so Howard Ratner. But past the glisten of diamonds and the cocaine mist of Uncut Gems, the Safdie Brothers have a crafted a potent mediation about the cost of our desires. And it’s a mesmerisingly unique human experience. The Howard Ratner experience. His life instantly feels both familiar and unfamiliar, and it’s this paradoxical mystery that won’t let you stop watching. There’s a profound cosmic hunger and melancholy that fuels Howard at the core. He’s magnetically drawn to the chaos of the moment even when he risks gravitating towards destruction. Ultimately, this all adds fuel to fire, making Uncut Gems an open-veined shot of adrenaline straight to the heart.",POSITIVE
"Jan 13, 2020"," 
  YOU know when Adam Sandler is bad he is very, very bad (I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry), and when he is good he is excellent (Punch-Drunk Love)? Well, in this New York-set drama from Josh and Benny Safdie (Good Time), the Sandler man is flat out terrific.
 
  Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a jeweller in the middle of the mother and father of a mid-life crisis. But then chaos seems to have been following the hard-gambling, fast-talking, womanising hustler all his days. But now he has a chance of a big score, courtesy of an opal from Africa, if he can just keep all the plates in his life spinning long enough to cash in. This is a white-knuckle ride of a film that never lets up in pace and plot. Howard, as his loathing wife tells him, is the most annoying man you will ever meet. He is also the most indefatigable, taking everything fate sends his way and coming back for more.

Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. How do you find out what an actor is made of? For New York indie-film brothers Benny and Josh Safdie, you put them under extreme duress and watch closely. In 2014’s no-fi heroin movie Heaven Knows What, non-professional lead Arielle Holmes delivered an electrifying study in desperation and resilience. Meanwhile, 2017’s Good Time has become go-to viewing for proof that Robert Pattinson deserves the Batmobile keys. For the Safdies’ latest character driven exercise in pulp-crime anxiety, Adam Sandler headlines Uncut Gems. It’s cruelly funny, for one thing. For another, the Safdies don’t so much reinvent Sandler as reframe him, playing to his impulsive man-child strengths in an environment that stretches them anew. A jeweller and debt-riddled gambler with an appetite for self-destruction, Sandler’s Howard Ratner gets into trouble as he tries to usher imported black opals to auction. He believes loaning them to NBA star Kevin Garnett will boost his luck, but fate decrees otherwise. As misfortune strikes, Ratner pinballs between estranged wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), patient lover Julia (Julia Fox) and no-nonsense creditors in his desperation to retrieve the rocks. Punch-Drunk Love aside, he’s never been better cast. A time-bomb of foolish compulsion and childlike rage, Sandler maintains our attention and empathy even as his behaviour becomes increasingly moronic and morally impaired.  Meanwhile, the Safdies cook up an atmosphere of conflict to magnetic effect. Conversations become f-bombstrafed explosions, turning the air of NYC’s Diamond District blue. Castwise, Menzel’s soul-freezing stare, Fox’s slow-burn nuances and supporting heavy Keith Williams Richards’ projections of threat charge the atmosphere with stakes and intensity.  Director of Photography Darius Khondji’s images contribute a dense, textured sense of immediacy; a Jewish dinner scene, meanwhile, feels entirely lived-in. Impressively, this inside-out engagement with a specific world manages to evoke the ’70s films of Sidney Lumet and Martin Scorsese (executive producing here) without suffering by comparison. Bursts of expressive direction strengthen the Safdies’ hold, such that even Ratner’s relationship with doors – surging through them, locked behind them – becomes loaded with meaning.  Daniel Lopatin’s grandiose synth score helps thicken the mood, pulsing with tension. Some viewers may find this wired worldview abrasive, but the Safdies’ uncompromised confidence of vision brings its own tumultuous rewards. As for Sandler, a gold  statuette come the Oscars would  not be undeserved.  Kevin Harley is a freelance journalist with bylines at Total Film, Radio Times, The List, and others, specializing in film and music coverage.

"Jan 10, 2020"," ★★★★☆One of the opening shots of Uncut Gems is a dazzling coup de cinema that zooms into an extreme close-up of newly mined opal, then dissolves into a quantum-level swirl through that stone’s molecular structure, then farther still, through a dreamlike dive into the fabric of the universe, before emerging outwards, very slowly, through the lower digestive tract of our central protagonist, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). He is unconscious and in the middle of a colonoscopy — the procedure is tastefully shot, but we can tell exactly where the medical camera is being inserted. It tells you everything you need to know about the subsequent film. It is beguiling, original, thought-provoking, yet also profoundly cloacal.",POSITIVE
"Jan 10, 2020"," I’m afraid I’m out of sync once again with most of my fellow critics on two of the most celebrated films of the year, Marriage Story and Uncut Gems. The movies as a whole did not impress, but some of the performances were true stand-outs. Noah Baumbach’s script, on the other hand, about the trials and tribulations of divorce and custody battles, is really nothing we haven’t seen before, on big or small screens. I will say the couples’ careers are new; one is an avant guard, award winning play director in New York, the other is a television star in Los Angeles. So relatable! At least it added a bicoastal aspect into the mix, and made their situation seem all the more dramatically untenable. As for Uncut Gems, who knew Adam Sandler, who plays Howard Ratner, an NYC Diamond District dealer, had that kind of raw, in-your-face talent? It’s by far the best performance of his career. Idina Menzel’s part as Ratner’s not-so-long-suffering wife is so far from frozen it’s smoking, and Julia Fox, as Sandler’s smarter-than-you-think girlfriend is a revelation. But that acerbic, abusive and abrasive script, in which almost everyone is aggressive and annoying, can drive a viewer to distraction. At first I found the Safdie brothers’ technique fresh and interesting. But you can only take so much of the leads yelling at each other while everyone in the background is yelling at the same time. Guys, give us a break! My companion and I had to pop a CBD gummy halfway through just to chill and keep our heads from exploding. Enough with the shouting already! Expect to see lots of awards nominations from these two films, but not a lot of wins, including from my own organization, The Critics Choice Association. The acting is outstanding, but the films, as a whole, are not. And that’s hard to overcome. If this Marriage Story review hasn’t dimmed your desire to see it, stream it now on Netflix. And if you still want to see Uncut Gems, it’s likely playing at a theater near you. Vegan CBD gummies available at BioFit360.com. You nailed it! I have a slight headache from the yelling and unfortunately had no CBD to help! Several people walked out, I almost did but kept thinking it was gonna “develop.”  It never did. I agree and the music was very strange and annoying and seemed misplaced. The opening credits went in for too long and the “background” music was not.

"Jan 10, 2020","Uncut Gems diminishes one of the richest comic sensibilities in modern cinema. It turns Sandler, the smartass who always chooses family and friendship over streetwise selfishness, into an icon of grungy nihilism.",NEGATIVE
"Jan 10, 2020"," The clue’s in the name Ratner – it’s not a positive association for us Brits (was this deliberate, I wonder?) and Howard is pushing the ‘crap’ envelope in his downmarket premises. He’s a gambling addict being chased by heavies for his huge debts, yet he can’t resist trying to solve all his problems with yet another massive gamble – smuggling in a rare, massive 5,000-carat black opal from an Ethiopian mine, hoping to sell it at auction for millions. In fact, Uncut Gems starts with the miners deep in the bowels – the winding tunnels – of the African mine, segueing almost imperceptibly into the endoscope following the interior of Howard’s own bowels as we see his colonoscopy live on screen. It’s telling us the desire for gems as a panacea for his ills is deep within his being. He’s addicted to risk and it drives all his bad decisions –like the bad decisions made by Robert Pattinson’s character in Good Times – over the course of a frenetic couple of days. The camera in Uncut Gems, like its ever more desperate manic central character, never stops hurtling around the streets of central New York and its suburbs. The rapid dialogue piles layer upon layer of fast-talking New York accents so that at first it’s hard to work out exactly what’s going on. What emerges is a man in free fall in both his shaky business and personal life – he has a wife, son and a mistress to keep happy – who never stops running just to stay in the same place to stand still for long enough to keep all his plates spinning in the air. Does his crazy plan work out for him? Does he get his life together? Well, he’s basically a shmuck but Sandler plays him to perfection and suspends our disbelief, even perhaps creates a little sympathy for him by the end of the film. Uncut Gems is a brilliant achievement for the two Safdie brothers – it’s exciting, entertaining filmmaking, a bittersweet soufflé with a hard centre, well worth seeing for Sandler’s virtuoso performance alone.",POSITIVE
"Jan 10, 2020"," Adam Sandler knows how to confound his critics. His career has developed a tendency to slip into semi-parody, as he cashes $500m cheques and, in return, delivers the Hollywood equivalent of a family vacation video (take last year’s Murder Mystery, conveniently set in the sun-kissed Mediterranean). But, on occasion, he’ll whip out a collaboration with auteurs such as Noah Baumbach or Paul Thomas Anderson and kick off the same cycle of disbelief at his talents as a dramatic actor. Yet what’s fascinating about his work is that the artful and artless represent two sides of the same coin. Whether it’s the Sandler of Pixels or The Meyerowitz Stories, his characters are always some heady combination of bitter egotism, childish naïveté, and impotent rage. He’s the unappreciated master of ruffled masculinity. In the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems, he plays Howard Ratner, a gambling addict and jeweller in New York’s Diamond District – it’s the best performance of his career. Sandler toys with his audience’s empathy, disgust and pity like a cat with its next meal. Much like the Safdies’ Good Time, which stars Robert Pattinson a small-time crook having the worst night of his life, Uncut Gems follows a downward spiral of self-made disaster. Howard, cornered by those he’s in debt to, attempts to outsmart destiny by acquiring a rare black opal from an Ethiopian mine in the hopes of selling it at auction for a cool million. His plan goes awry when he reluctantly agrees to let basketball player Kevin Garnett (generously sending himself up) borrow the opal as a good luck charm for the NBA’s Eastern Conference finals. Howard thrives on the facade. His arrogance comes from the belief that there’s no situation he can’t talk himself out of (or into). He’ll use gold-and-diamond encrusted Furbies and fake Rolexes as a distraction, treating human beings the same as magpies. But the bitter comedy of Uncut Gems is how easily Howard can be broken. He’s humiliated time and time again – chewed out in public by his assistant (Lakeith Stanfield) and dressed down in private by his estranged wife (Idina Menzel, whose stare could melt steel). Even the person most loyal to him – his doll-faced, attentive mistress (Julia Fox, in a knockout debut) – ends up screaming in his face outside a club at 3am. He’s pathetic, but both Sandler and the Safdies find ways to spin tragedy out of karmic retribution. The film magnificently frames modern life as a world of illusions, where a busy life equates to a successful one and the gamble always pays off. It’s an almost punishingly chaotic film, though each line of overlapping dialogue and jittery camera move is carefully orchestrated. The film opens on a tracking shot that travels through the cosmic heart of the opal before smoothly transitioning into the inside of Howard’s rectum during a routine colonoscopy. It’s mysterious and grotesque in equal measure, as Daniel Lopatin’s twinkling synth score interjects at crucial moments to hint at the opal’s supernatural hold over those who come into its possession. In fact, the only moment of stillness in the entire film is when Howard is left alone with the gem, fondling it with a mix of sexual desire and religious awe. For the audience, it comes with the crushing realisation that he’s sacrificed everything for a piece of rock and a hare-brained scheme. Uncut Gems is a fairytale written by the hand of capitalism, where mystical highs are followed by crushing blows – and there’s always a price to pay. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2020"," Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love has long been held aloft by Adam Sandler advocates as proof of the 53-year-old’s acting chops. While years of shoddy comedies have undone some of that good work, A24 and Netflix thriller Uncut Gems is another sorely-needed reminder of his obvious talents. The latest film from brothers Josh and Benny Safdie (their last outing Good Time saw a bank-robbing, peroxide Robert Pattinson take centre stage), Uncut Gems is not only one of the tightest, tensest American thrillers of recent years but also a fine addition to the New York-set movie canon. Sandler plays blink-king Howard Ratner, a compulsive gambler and the brand new owner of a rare and valuable black opal – the uncut gem of the title – stolen away from Ethiopian “black jews” after a 17-month pursuit. With plans to auction off the opal for $1 million-plus and in debt to local loanshark Arno (Eric Bogosian), all Howard needs is for the fates to smile upon him once again. However, when a chance encounter with the Boston Celtics’ Kevin Garnett (playing himself) sees the basketball star lending the opal for longer than promised in order to harness its supposed “mystical” powers, Howard is forced to gamble with other people’s prized possessions – and cash – in order to retrieve the stone in time for the impending auction date. Taking us from an Ethiopian opal mine to the streets of 2012’s NYC via Howard’s own colon – an early contender for best “opening” of 2020 – Uncut Gems marries its frenetic, fast-paced narrative of big bets and even bigger stakes with a plethora of bravura visual flourishes. In his endless quest for the next pay-off, Howard takes in neon-bathed nightclubs, pawnshops and even a family Passover meal, each location resplendent with its own unique sights and sounds. Add to that a pumping electronic soundtrack courtesy of Daniel Lopatin and a stellar cast (Sandler is ably supported by LaKeith Stanfield, Idina Menzel as Howard’s long-suffering wife Dinah and newcomer Julia Fox), and Uncut Gems is a film endlessly rich in tone and texture. Already A24’s highest-grossing film of all time at the US box office (on $38 million), the odds have certainly been in the Safdie brothers’ favour when it comes to their most commercial offering to date. Combine that with Sandler’s unquestionable legion of fans – Netflix subscribers or otherwise – and Uncut Gems should reach the wide audience it so richly deserves. While this isn’t the type of film – or central performance – the Academy normally celebrates, perhaps we can even dream of an Oscar nomination for Sandler next week. As Howard himself exclaims: “I made a crazy risk, a gamble, and it’s about to pay off.”",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2020"," For all the negativity that surrounds Adam Sandler, the comedian continues to prove his value in the industry. Most of the noise revolves around his buddy films at Happy Madison, which seemingly release every quarter or two. However, Sandler has now been a staple of American entertainment for more than a quarter-century. Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison became classics of the 1990s, and many of his romcoms, specifically the Drew Barrymore films, have earned their place in pop culture. Sandler remains one of the generational stars and godfathers of comedy, regardless of how you feel about the man-boy antics. Its wonder that the stars have aligned for Sandler and his new film Uncut Gems, which instantly becomes one of the most unnerving experiences of the year. Uncut Gems follows Howard (Sandler), a popular jeweler in New York’s diamond district. While he has a wife (Idina Menzel) and kids, Howard’s consistently looking for the next big score. A gambling addict and serial cheater, he needs adrenaline to live. When he loses money to a local boss Arlo (Eric Bogosian), his anxiety and bad behavior spin out of control. As he attempts to unload a valuable Opal from Africa, NBA star Kevin Garnett provides Howard a way out of his troubles…if he can get control of his life. Every once in a while, a director with a vision takes Sandler down a different path. The results speak for themselves, with Sandler often earning best-in-show acclaim when he goes this route. The Safdie Brothers now join this list, using the anger and inherent comedy within Sandler to their advantage. There’s something about his smile and wolfish glances at women that will unnerve you. Creating the character of Howard feels like Sandler returning to his roots, both embracing the scummy underbelly of his career and his Jewish heritage. The things that make Sandler so damn likable are on display, and you empathize with a man who would be the textbook definition of unlikable. Sandler’s revving on all engines, and will certainly become one of the most talked-about performances of his career. Josh and Bennie Safdie prove to masterful in their use of tension. For a film that breaks the two-hour mark, it moves with astonishing speed at times. They demonstrate a masterful handle on tension, allowing the film to hit several peaks and valleys along the way. Their snapshot of the diamond district impresses, allowing us to feel the dichotomy between the grimy world Howard inhabits and the big money that works as its lifeblood. You would rarely expect millionaires and the super-rich to find themselves in the mud, but the Safdies create the ultimate playground for these men. To complement to film’s visuals, a synth-based score echoes throughout the film. Composer Daniel Lopatin knocks it out of the park with the unnerving energy in each musical accompaniment. Unsurprising to most basketball fans, but likely shocking to most moviegoers, Garnett absolutely owns the screen. The future Hall-of-Famer gets a juicy role, and in his limited time, he impresses. He functions as a stand-in for the audience, and his reactions are priceless. KG shows off, running laps around many lifelong performers. Menzel plays wildly out-of-type with some great moments too. Her anger and a general disdain for Howie inform the longevity of his bad decision making. Without Menzel, you do not realize the life he’s giving up in his quest to hit it big. Uncut Gems will not be for everyone, and a big reason for that will be its marketing. Far from being the pseudo-heist film that was promised, the tension driven thriller will fray some nerves. With Sandler’s deeply unlikable Howard leading the way, many will tune out. Yet the hypnotic story captivated me, and with dozens of my favorite things in a single movie, I came out of it grinning from ear to ear.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2020"," There always has been and there ever will be a tremendous fascination in watching a human being self-destruct. Call it morbid curiosity, moral pathos or shock of recognition, but the vision of a man hitting the skids through his own fatal flaws — Cain, Achilles, Tiger Woods, Richard Nixon — exerts a gravitational pull on our collective attention. It is the essence of tragedy: Glad that’s not me, that could be me and, on the deepest level, that is me. Watching the downward trajectory of someone blind to their own imminent smash-up, whether in life or in art, is also wildly anxiety provoking, and it’s here that the Safdie brothers, co-directors Benny and Josh, have planted a cinematic flag. Their 2017 film Good Time, about the aftermath of a botched bank robbery, is a masterpiece of adrenalized claustrophobia — a hyper-real panic attack that can’t draw a breath without further fucking itself. The latest Safdie offering, Uncut Gems, is both more and less of the same. It lacks their previous film’s hallucinogenic, rapid-fire aesthetic of millennial paranoia, swapping it out for a more sustained and deliberate (but no less anxious) gaze into its antihero’s unraveling. In this regard, it’s no wonder that one of the executive producers on this one is Martin Scorsese, to whom the Safdie’s owe a massive debt with a seriously jacked-up vig. To wit, the smarmily charming, chronically self-sabotaging Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in Uncut Gems is an updated, older and paunchier version of Robert De Niro’s Johnny Boy in Scorsese’s Mean Streets, and if you know that 1973 film, you know to a large extent where Uncut Gems is going, and how it feels to get there. This isn’t a bad thing, necessarily, though the familiar territory does rob the film of that edgy sense of discovery that was Good Time’s greatest strengths. At the center of the story is the titular uncut gem, a rare black opal unearthed in an African mine by Ethiopian Jews. Ratner, a shady jeweler in New York’s Diamond District, gets his hands on a load of these gems embedded in a chunk of rock, with the plan of auctioning them off to pay off a loan before the sharks get him. When former NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (yes, the real Garnett) enters his store, Ratner convinces him of its almost supernatural significance, setting off a weird chain of events in which Ratner — constantly robbing Peter to pay Paul, and placing outrageous sports bets — hopes to strike it rich. Subplots proliferate, each one an etch on Ratner’s character: There’s Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), a con man who becomes Ratner’s go-between with Garnett; his falling-apart marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel); his affair with his imperturbably loyal girlfriend and employee Julia (Julia Fox); and his pursuit by Arno (Eric Bogosian), a low-level gangster who also happens to be Ratner’s brother-in-law. Judd Hirsch is great at Gooey, Ratner’s long-suffering father-in-law. A Jewish man-child adrift in the dregs of the American Dream, Sandler’s Ratner is — like, often, Sandler himself — a figure whose attractive qualities are nearly indistinguishable from the repulsion he inspires. I’ve never found the man all that funny, but I am compelled by the sliver of nihilism that seems to lurk in his character, and that darkness here suits him well. Despite his petty villainy and emotional cowardice, you can almost root for the guy to hit it big, all the while understanding that the idea of hitting it big is the root of his problem, and ours.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2020"," It takes great discipline to deliver indiscipline on this scale. Josh and Benny Safdie dipped toes in New York's pinballing underground with the compulsive Good Time, but Uncut Gems marks a notable escalation of hostilities. It is to the earlier film as Ulysses was to A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. At times, the portrait of midtown Manhattan suggests a flick-book of Polaroids viewed amid an inner-city riot. It is all grain and noise and desperation. One dreads to think what they might have accomplished with the addition of Odorama. Yet there is a shape here. These angular film-makers wouldn’t allow anything so sentimental as character development, but their encouragement to sympathise with an urban weasel of Dickensian proportions ultimately proves hard to resist. The devil has the most cacophonous tunes. That useless, energetic hustler – a jeweller in the Diamond District – takes the Marmite form of Adam Sandler. Having run up gambling debts of some $100,000, Howard Ratner (that surname's resonances are entirely fortuitous) has pitched hopes of salvation on a rare black opal smuggled in from Ethiopia. Things go wrong. Things always go wrong for Adam Sandler characters. The best of the star’s straight roles – think Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love – have been those in which he plays a terrifying version of his stock comic weirdo. Ratner is smarter than the fools in Big Daddy and Happy Gilmore, but, like them, he is essentially a child in man’s trousers. Distracted and flattered by the attentions of a professional basketball player, he loans the rock out for a few days. Misunderstandings with his bookie (an ageless, sinister Eric Bogosian) soon highlight the foolishness of that decision. Eventually, as you might expect from a Sandler joint, he ends up naked in the boot of a car. Sandler uses his talent to irritate for good in a film that never soothes when it can grate. Daniel Lopatin amplifies ambient drones into effective simulacra for tinnitus. Darius Khondji’s camera apes the spotty fuzz of aged 16mm. All this invites such total immersion in one corner of New York that the picture takes on an anthropological flavour. To ape Joyce again, future societies could rebuild the Diamond District from a few viewings of Uncut Gems: creased brows, expensive suits, stuffed glass cabinets everywhere. There is humanity in here as well. Julia Fox offers a touching breakthrough performance as Howard's girlfriend. Idina Menzel owns the screen (and the whole cinema and the entire block on which it sits) as the misused, defiant mother of his children. The audience, eager to give such characters their due, has to crane its collective neck as the momentum drags it to a relentless conclusion. But it's worth the muscular strain. There's more to Uncut Gems than dizzying momentum. I am not, however, altogether sure I could handle their Finnegans Wake.",POSITIVE

"Jan 9, 2020"," This sensationally good New York crime drama is rocket-fuelled with greed and crack-fumed with fear. It is directed by the Safdie brothers, Benny and Josh, who create something deliciously horrible, working with their longtime screenwriter-collaborator Ronald Bronstein. It conjures up the work of James Toback and John Cassavetes – and indeed early Martin Scorsese, who is an executive producer here. There is a consistency of purpose that their earlier film, Good Time, lacked. In its unforced, gripping, black-comic chaos, Uncut Gems resembles nothing so much as a super-violent, feature-length episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Safdies have cast as their leading man Adam Sandler who gives a glorious, career-best turn as a fast-talking Manhattan diamond dealer called Howard Ratner (dare we hope for a cheeky reference to the British jeweller Gerald?), sporting a black leather jacket, dark glasses, earrings and an ingratiating, unreliable grin. Sandler has been known for pretty crass comedies in the past, though polite broadsheet opinion traditionally makes an exception for his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2002 film Punch-Drunk Love. For me, that was a bit overblown, and in any case Sandler is far better here. Howard is semi-separated from his wife Dinah (played by Idina Menzel – the voice of Frozen’s Elsa) and kids, though still importantly embedded in the Jewish customs involved in her family dinners. He has now installed his sexy, vocal-fry-toned employee Julia (Julia Fox) in a cheesily decorated bachelor apartment in the city. His diamond shop is a heavily fortified, sweaty and airless emporium, protected by a castle-keep system of inner and outer toughened-glass doors opened with a nerve-jangling buzzer. Howard’s business is doing reasonably well, thanks to a middleman called Demany (great work from Lakeith Stanfield) who brings high net worth individuals from the world of music and sports into Howard’s store in return for a cut of the sale price; Howard takes his own commission for selling Demany’s counterfeit Rolexes as certified genuine. Howard is looking to make a fat profit with an illegally imported black opal from Ethiopia, the equivalent of a “blood diamond” but a stone of mythical import and rarity that fascinates Howard’s biggest celeb customer: NBA megastar Kevin Garnett (playing himself) who is capriciously convinced that this is an anti-kryptonite rock that guarantees victory on the basketball court. Like vintage 70s horror, Uncut Gems begins with an eerie prologue showing this occult stone being discovered deep underground. So things look good for Howard, but there’s a problem. He is a compulsive gambling addict whose habit is raging out of control – though part of this movie’s 70s feel lies in the fact that he is never described as an “addict” and never recognises himself as such. He has a sideline in taking customers’ valuable pieces of jewellery for supposed repair (a kitsch figure of the crucified Michael Jackson being a case in point) but actually using them as collateral for huge mob loans that he will then bet on pro sports: usually basketball, with which he is obsessed. And he is borrowing against future assumed sales or sure-fire gambling wins to make other bets or pay off other creditors. Howard is in very deep with an intimidating player called Arno (Eric Bogosian) whose man-mountain goons make an unwelcome appearance at his store. Sandler’s superb performance shows how Howard has what amounts to a superpower – his optimism, his toxic gift of the gab, his deranged delusional cheerfulness and his refusal to be fazed or scared by things that would reduce ordinary people to jelly. There’s an incredible sequence on the streets of Manhattan – which the Safdies and their cinematographer Darius Khondji shoot with rangy, loose-limbed exuberance – showing Howard getting punched in the throat by one of his debt collectors and then, after a moment of traumatic wheezing, he goes on walking, talking, attempting to bamboozle his assailant with ersatz charm. But Howard is robbing Peter to pay Paul, in such a way that Peter and Paul are eventually going to take turns holding him down while the other beats the daylight out of him. His whole life is a pyramid scheme of dishonesty, in which the victim is himself. And all the time the film is in a state of deafening cacophonous uproar: the white noise in poor Howard’s head is displaced into the streets, the clubs, the sports arenas where his terrible humiliation is to be played out. It’s a cinema of pure energy and grungy voltage, and the Safdies make it look very easy. This will be the year’s most exciting film. You can take that to the bank.",POSITIVE
"Jan 9, 2020"," Adam Sandler puts in an extraordinary turn in Josh and Benny Safdie’s anxiety-inducing new crime thriller Uncut Gems. The brothers whose 2017 film Good Time went a long way towards adding some much needed street cred to Twilight star Robert Pattinson's acting career, could well earn a best actor nod for Sandler at the Oscar next month. The adrenaline-charged drama is  the brothers' most Jewish production to date. Set in 2012 in the New York Diamond District, Uncut Gems follows the trials of Howard Ratner (Sandler), a hapless Jewish jeweller in the midst of a destructive midlife crisis and mounting gambling debts. With Pesach around the corner and a life split between his soon-to-be-ex wife Dinah (a fantastically acerbic Idina Manzel) and much younger new girlfriend Julia (newcomer Julia Fox), Howard may have finally bitten off far more than he can chew. Chased by creditors around town, Howard has pinned all his hopes on a  fraudulently acquired piece of rock covered in uncut gems. After bragging about his new acquisition to new customer and famous NBA player Kevin Garnett (Garnett playing himself), basketball-mad Howard agrees to lend him the rock for 24 hours for luck. All hell breaks loose when Garnett fails to return the rock on time, leaving Howard unsure if he’ll be able to add the piece to an upcoming auction. This disjointed intense thriller has all the makings of an instant classic and is  the Safdie brothers’ best work to date. Along with co-writer Ronald Bronstein, the fearless filmmaking duo have given us a heart-racing experience which should come with a health warning for those of a nervous disposition. Elevated by a fantastically eclectic soundtrack courtesy of Brooklyn based electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never — the musician also worked on the Safdies' previous film Good Time — Uncut Gems provides a respite from the usual run of the mill crime thrillers being churned out by Hollywood .",POSITIVE
"Jan 8, 2020"," Brothers and co-directors Josh and Benny Safdie are two of the most exciting names working in modern independent cinema, so their film “Uncut Gems” debuted alongside a shadow of grandiose expectations. The bottom line is that the film is good but far from great, and I’m comfortable going out on a limb and guessing those crowing the loudest about how fresh and original this movie is haven’t seen their far superior 2017 film, “Good Time.” New York City jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is always on the lookout for the next big score. When he makes a series of high stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime, Howard finds himself struggling to keep the balance between the growing list of adversaries, his business, his scams, and his home life. There isn’t much to the story other than a lot of cursing and ongoing scams, but there’s a decent sense of suspense that carries through the majority of the film. The most shocking thing about “Uncut Gems” is that it lacks depth, especially when compared to “Good Time.” It’s not unfair to compare the two films, as each portray a gritty side of the city with antiheros who are close to completely hitting the skids. An effective crime thriller should have a lead character you can at least root for if not relate to, and Howard isn’t it. Sandler’s character is an irritating scumbag and while I guess that’s what he was going for in his performance, it’s shrill and unpleasant to spend time around this loser. I didn’t really care to see the end of Howard’s story because by the time it rolled around, I was completely worn down by his repeated poor decisions. Here’s what happens in the film: Howard lies, gets cash, gambles it away, extends himself, gets a beating / stern warning / workplace visit from goons, then lies, gets cash, gambles it away, extends himself, and gets another beat down / visit from more goons. It’s an exhausting repetition of watching a sleazy scumbag spiraling out of control by digging himself deeper into a hole. His cycle of poor decisions is coupled with an indestructible optimism of a life-changing big score. Why should I care about somebody like that? Sandler is good in the lead role, but much of the praise seems to be coming from the fact that, after a career in comedy films, his performance is unexpected. He’s a talented man, but he’s been even better in other, smaller films (like Noah Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories”). Howard is a loud, crude, unpleasant man to spend time with, but Sandler inhabits the role as a shady jewelry dealer and degenerate gambler in a way that lends the slightest glimmer of humanity to an otherwise detestable character. The film plays like a hardcore, taxing Scorsese ripoff. It’s not very exciting, and the tension that does exist feels forced. The direction is more conventional than the material suggests, but major applause to the Safdie brothers for conveying their clear vision and having the courage to stick with it. They’ve started to corner the cinematic market on adapting the gritty side of New York for a modern era. I don’t feel the Safdies are as overrated as some other critics do, but I do think this film is bloated in all the wrong ways. He did see it, he didn’t like it and didn’t really want to bother with writing a review. The film really divides people, that’s for sure! I wanted to love it because I absolutely adored “Good Time,” but little about “Uncut Gems” worked for either of us.  Additionally, your blanket statement that “those crowing the loudest about how fresh and original this movie is haven’t seen their far superior 2017 film, “Good Time.” is objectively wrong, as some of Uncut Gems’s most popular reviews state that it’s even better than “Time”. Just Google Chris Stuckmann’s and Peter Bradshaw’s reviews to see what I mean by that. [I initially tried linking to them, but that got my comment removed, so I guess that isn’t something I can do here. Oh well.] Oh, the removed comment just showed up again, and it says “Your comment is awaiting moderation.” (even though I first published it more than 6 hours ago).

Thanks. “Sandler’s character is an irritating scumbag and while I guess that’s what he was going for in his performance, it’s shrill and unpleasant to spend time around this loser.” What’s interesting about that (at least, to me) is that “Good Time”‘s protagonist, besides loving his brother, didn’t have many redeemable qualities either (particularly when he literally seems to be on the verge of having sex with an underage girl to distract her), yet that film got a much higher rating from you. What compelling qualities did you feel Connie Nikas had that Howard Ratner just didn’t? Your style is unique compared to other people I’ve read stuff from.

"Jan 8, 2020"," Usually the combination of Adam Sandler and Netflix would bring us out in a cold sweat, but Uncut Gems opened up a whole other can of anxiety – in a good way.  It seems odd to recommend a movie that makes you feel constantly stressed, yet it's a unique experience that you'll find hard to tear yourself away from. That's if it doesn't all become too anxiety-inducing for you, mind. He thinks he's found it in the form of a rare black opal that he's acquired from Ethiopia at some cost, with Howard aiming to sell it at auction and net himself a huge pay day, but only if a series of high-stakes bets come off. After a cold open set in Ethiopia, Uncut Gems certainly has an bold statement of intent as it introduces Howard by showing us the journey through his colon (on a hospital monitor fortunately, not in close-up). You'd think it was because the writer/directors Josh and Benny Safdie just wanted to be shocking, but you come to realise that being in-your-face and bold is just what Uncut Gems does. We follow Howard as he goes about his business in the store, which includes working with Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) to sell fake watches, and goes about town setting up outrageous bets and pawning collateral to set even bigger bets. Characters constantly talk over one another and the impressive score feels like it's been set at a volume that's just a bit too loud. There's a lot to take in and the worry when Uncut Gems hits Netflix is that it'll turn some viewers off after 20 or so minutes, especially as Howard rattles off basketball terms and betting lingo that will alienate those not in the know. But you soon get used to the rhythm and the tone, getting sucked into Howard's world as he tries everything to finally come out on top. It's two and a bit hours of watching a gambling addict take increasingly terrible – and increasingly risky – decisions, constantly aware that it's probably not going to end well.  In large part, that's down to the excellent performance from Adam Sandler. We know he can do dramatic roles, so it's not a huge surprise, but it's a transformative role for the actor and his best yet. Howard really isn't too likeable (and characters frequently call him out on it), yet Sandler's performance makes you will him to succeed, even when he's being a dick to his girlfriend Julia (a terrific Julia Fox). It's what makes the final act an almost-unbearable watch. Just when it looks like things are on the up for Howard, outside circumstances – and Howard himself – conspire to pile on the tension. Uncut Gems leaves you breathless and stunned as the credits roll, and it's not a movie you can instantly make a judgement on, if only because you'll struggle to get your words out. That doesn't make it flawless. It could do with some trimming, especially during the middle act, and things can get a little shouty – for want of a better word – as Howard frequently clashes with those around him.  ©2024 Hearst UK is the trading name of the National Magazine Company Ltd, 30 Panton Street, Leicester Square, London, SW1Y 4AJ.

"Jan 7, 2020"," Adam Sandler. We know he can’t act. He’s the latter-day embodiment of a certain type of late-1970s, New York frat-boy cultural specimen who tended to be drawn to the toilet-centric early work of Howard Stern, Frank Zappa, Lou Reed, Monty Python, and the Ramones. Goofball Adam—he’s always been a kind of uncut gem himself. Ratner’s shop in the Big Apple’s diamond district is a watering hole for a variety of social vermin as well as those looking for a nice rock to go down on one knee with. Ratner specializes is some seriously tacky pieces, like diamond-encrusted Furbies with manually movable eyes. And if Ratner keeps living on the gambling edge, his shop will soon also be attracting bounty hunters. Ratner’s barely holding it together; he’s that kind of individual with a particular kind of grit that thrives on the chaos of a myriad shifting deals, of sudden setbacks, a fed-up wife, a too-young mistress, and the ever-present, unsavory gangster fringe of loan sharks and bookies he owes. One of these would-be debt collectors is Arno (Eric Bogosian), who would seriously hurt Ratner if it weren’t for the fact that he’s also married to Ratner’s wife’s sister. So Arno merely locks Ratner, naked, in Ratner’s car’s trunk as an interim retribution. Garnett was brought to Ratner’s showroom by Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who Ratner hired to schmooze the hip-hop crowd and the athletes with tales of rare trinkets and bling, and also brings in occasional high-end watches. From whence they cometh is unclear. “Uncut Gems” is set in the not-too-distant past, which makes it feel like Garnett, who retired in 2016, is still playing. Garnett must have that uncut opal, and he must have it now, so they work out a deal where he can carry it around for a day in exchange for his giant, white-gold Celtics championship ring (with an inlaid emerald clover) as collateral. Ratner’s life is an elaborate train wreck waiting to happen, where we see the boulder sitting on the tracks, but he manages last second to shunt the train down an alternate set of tracks we didn’t see over there in the underbrush. It’s a pressure cooker—a cunning yet hapless clown juggling 15 balls simultaneously, and it’ll seriously raise your blood pressure. The question is, do you feel the need to do that? “Uncut Gems” is like the dark, serious cousin of “Midnight Run,” another film about taking gambles, debt-collecting, and juggling a million catastrophes.",NEUTRAL

"Jan 6, 2020"," Directed by Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie.
Starring Adam Sandler, Julia Fox, Lakeith Stanfield, Kevin Garnett, Idina Menzel, Eric Bogosian, Jonathan Aranbayev, Mike Francesa, Jacob Igielski, Noa Fisher, Paloma Elsesser, Judd Hirsch, Benjy Kleiner, Josh Ostrovsky, Sahar Bibiyan, Lana Levitin, Keith Williams Richards, Pom Klementieff, The Weeknd, Trinidad James, Tilda Swinton, and Natasha Lyonne. A charismatic jeweler makes a high-stakes bet that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. In a precarious high-wire act, he must balance business, family and adversaries on all sides in pursuit of the ultimate win. It’s basically a set pattern at this point that Adam Sandler surprises audiences with an effort-filled performance every couple of years, sandwiched in-between several lousy Netflix “comedies” and all his usual genre output. But this time he’s not paired himself with a storied auteur such as Paul Thomas Anderson or Noah Baumbach, but the down-and-dirty – yet undeniably on-the-rise – filmmaker duo Benny and Josh Safdie, best known for their riveting 2017 Robert Pattinson-starring thriller Good Time. And the result of this unorthodox partnership is a beguiling yet frequently stunning piece of work that’s easily the best thing its star or creators have ever done. While sure to alienate both fans of Sandler’s traditional content and anyone with moderate-to-severe levels of anxiety, Uncut Gems is nevertheless an entrancingly intense ride well worth taking. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a jeweler operating in New York’s snazzy Diamond District, who quite unfortunately also happens to be a gambling addict. When his creditors come a-calling, Howard hopes that his recent receipt of a prized black opal gem, which he intends to send to auction, might solve all of his problems. But ever at the mercy of his own compulsive vices, Howard wrestles as much against his own self-destructive gambling habits as he does those he owes money. This is a tricky proposition of a film for several reasons; first and foremost, almost every scene in the movie consists of characters talking over – and often, shouting over – one another. If this annoys you enough in real life, it’s likely to do the same here, even accepting the fraught nature of Howard’s situation – if often self-inflicted. But this overlapping approach to dialogue does also help Uncut Gems feel uniquely grounded and believable as a scenario which could transpire, in all of its wordy drama, in real life. The second major hurdle is that Sandler’s protagonist is such a tough sell. He’s loud, he’s vulgar, and he frequently seems to shuffle himself closer to the edge of a cliff he just can’t help but peer down at any moment. Even when a bet or deal goes his way, he’s immediately pondering how he can parlay the win into an even bigger windfall. While frustrating, it perfectly encapsulates the gambler’s self-annihilating mindset, and in a remarkably subtle way, Sandler quite brilliantly exploits his popular persona to shockingly subversive effect. Though Sandler is best known for his boisterous, obnoxious knucklehead characters, Howard is a more believable brand of brash, and most crucially, is also imbued with a weird and unexpected amount of charm by the funnyman. He becomes a figure the audience almost comes to root for if only to see him avoiding a grim fate, and that’s largely because Sandler lends an air of quiet sympathy to a man who is quite clearly his own worst enemy. It’s a remarkable trick from Sandler, a talented actor who frequently takes the creative low-road for a mighty paycheck, and a performance that is without question the most nuanced and engaging work of his entire three-decade career. He’s also backed up by a killer supporting cast. Julia Fox, quite unbelievably a first-time actress, is rather brilliant in her own right as Howard’s mistress Julia, and despite her first impression perhaps suggesting a trophy girlfriend stereotype, she’s by turns far more complex than that. Lakeith Stanfield is also reliably solid as Howard’s frustrated assistant Demany, and Judd Hirsch gets a few cracking scenes as Howard’s father-in-law Gooey – though many of the film’s most memorable roles actually come from non-actors. In particular, former NBA star Kevin Garnett is surprisingly hilarious here, playing a fictionalised version of himself who becomes near-literally hypnotised by the opal gem which comes into Howard’s possession, and occasional actor Idina Menzel, of course better known for her singing, is effective in a few brief scenes as Howard’s exasperated, long-suffering estranged wife Dinah. Uncut Gems is certainly directed with all the urgency and panache befitting a pair of hungry young filmmakers, and the Safdies are supported by a robust technical package throughout. The aesthetic revels in its scuzziness almost as much as Good Time did, with legendary DP Darius Khondji’s grainy, handheld camerawork perfectly creating a lived-in, grungy depiction of the New York streets. If a stirring musical score from Daniel Lopatin – who also scored the Safdies’ previous – sets the tone wonderfully, what’s truly memorable about Uncut Gems aurally-speaking, is the fantastic sound mix spearheaded by Oscar-winning mixer Skip Lievsay (Gravity, Roma). Ingeniously, incidental dialogue – be it the bustling city streets or peripheral characters speaking in the background – is pushed to the front of the mix and, when viewed on the big screen, recreates the enervating intensity of reality with a jaw-dropping verisimilitude. Though it’s probably an effect too subtle for the Academy to reward with a Best Sound Mixing Oscar nomination, and its impending Netflix release internationally means many won’t benefit from hearing it through an industry-grade sound system, it is absolutely one of the most creative and effective soundscapes of the entire year, without a spaceship, superhero, or race car in sight no less. Uncut Gems won’t be for everyone, and that’s absolutely fine; I can’t blame anyone who finds its aggressive pace too offputting or simply struggles to connect with Sandler’s character. But for audiences prepared to follow Sandler and the Safdies down this dark path, it’s a tremendously rewarding – and, yes, stressful as hell – drama without even a whiff of artistic compromise about it.",POSITIVE

"Jan 6, 2020"," Diamonds are formed under extreme pressure in the Earth’s crust. But it seems unlikely that any gem has been subjected to pressure quite as extreme as that which bears down on Howard Ratner, the hero of this triumphant flop sweat of a movie. Howard, a fast-talking dealer of precious stones in New York’s Diamond District, is a man in perpetual crisis. He’s introduced mid-colonoscopy (the placement of the camera is one hell of a mission statement), wheels frantically between two women (his unimpressed wife and his adoring mistress), and plies his trade in a glass cube of stress (the blaring door buzzers alone will take  a toll on your nerves). And that’s before you even consider the dead-eyed goons dogging Howard’s every step, determined to extract the debt he owes. Howard isn’t great with money, you see, or rather he’s never happy with the money he’s got, always angling for a big score. The film rushes alongside him towards something major: whether that event will make him or break him is the great unknown. The idea of a feature-length panic attack, essentially the cocaine-chopper-and-cooking freak-out scene from GoodFellas stretched out to two hours, might not sound appealing. Especially when you consider that Howard is played by Adam Sandler, making this his latest Netflix film after such non-classics as The Ridiculous 6 and Murder Mystery. Yet the Safdie Brothers’ Uncut Gems proves to be one of the most mesmerising thrillers in a long time, and Sandler is a major reason why it works. It’s a career-best performance, reminiscent of his character study 17 years ago in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love but even more layered and magnetic. His Howard is instantly iconic: part Job, part Jordan Belfort, part Jerry Maguire, he’s louchely attired, balancing out his shady wardrobe and dirtbag facial hair with a Star of David pinkie ring. Rarely stopping to take a breath, he is by turns hilarious, soulful and maddening; drilling down into a character who seems initially cartoonish but becomes ever more fascinating and human, Sandler is totally believable as a rapacious lowlife with big dreams. “I’m gonna come!” he gasps early on, as he glimpses his latest acquisition, a hunk of rare Ethiopian opal he’s procured with great effort on the strength of a YouTube video clip. This mine-dug rock, which shimmers with all the hues of the rainbow and which may or may not have mystical powers, is the film’s MacGuffin, Howard’s own personal Infinity Stone, and he is hellbent on getting it to auction. Complicating this goal is a superstitious NBA superstar (former Celtics player Kevin Garnett, playing himself in a meta plot-strand which places the story as unfolding in 2012), fake Rolexes, a brace of local gangsters and other factors it’s better not to reveal. And doing a masterful job of orchestrating all the mayhem are sibling directors Josh and Benny Safdie, proving once again that they are the maestros of the New York stressmare. Their 2017 breakout hit Good Time cast Robert Pattinson as a crook hustling around the city’s grimier corners in the aftermath  of a bank robbery. Uncut Gems follows a similar formula, but it’s even slicker and more propulsive, evoking such classics as Dog Day Afternoon and After Hours in its ability to wring maximum ‘what now?’ tension from its milieu. Sequences that promise to deliver some respite from the overriding sense of dread, such as Howard’s attempt to see his daughter perform in her school play, have a tendency to spiral out of control. And even his late-night amorous visit to his mistress (played with a winning mix of guilelessness and grit by newcomer Julia Fox) is staged in a way designed to put you on edge, thanks to Howard’s inability to do anything without taking some kind of risk. It’s a breathless hustle, a wild ride that threatens to fly off the rails at any moment. But there’s actually a meticulous control of every element: the Robert-Altman-on-crack overlapping dialogue (designed to subtly steer your ear to the most crucial information); the ducking-and-diving camerawork (jittery even in quieter, domestic moments); the perfectly cast supporting players (it says a lot when Eric Bogosian isn’t the most menacing-looking person on screen); the intense electro score by Daniel Lopatin. All of it locks you firmly inside the head of a man who can’t slow down, even if he wanted to. “Boils... Locusts… Death of the firstborn,” he recites at one point during a tense Passover Seder, listing the Biblical plagues. Then he grins: “Hardcore.” For Howard Ratner, that’s a slow Tuesday.",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020"," It’s a compulsion that pulls us to slow down and gawk at accidents and train-wrecks; the very thing that allows a television program like “The Jerry Springer Show” to exist. Cinematically, that uncomfortable draw that keeps audiences on the edge of their seats can be the same feeling that prevents people from seeing an incredible film more than once. The much heralded, Golden Globe-winning “Joker” is like that, as is the latest feature from Josh and Benny Safdie, the writer-director brother indie darling tandem behind 2017’s standout crime drama “Good Time.” With their new movie “Uncut Gems,” the Safdie brothers crank the volume up to 11 on their signature brand of frenetic, gritty New York City film spectacle in a must-see, then likely never see again drama. Adam Sandler gives the transformative performance of his career as Howard Ratner, a diamond district jeweler whose obsession with sports gambling and the big score puts him at odds with clients, loan sharks and his estranged family. Sandler disappears so fully into Howard that it’s often hard to remember Sandler’s comedic work during “Gems.” There’s an eccentricity to Sandler’s performance that emboldens audiences to live inside the world of the film and accept this familiar character on his own terms and not as it relates to Sandler. When audiences watch an actor like Robert De Niro or Al Pacino, they often find themselves engulfed within their performances and still never take their minds off the fact that De Niro or Pacino are playing the parts. Who they are as personalities can never be totally removed from the work. Sandler’s Howard pulls viewers in so fully – in large part thanks to the Safdies’ pitch-perfect screenplay – that the comedian himself fades away behind the glasses and goatee, something Sandler has never been able to pull off before in a 20-plus year movie career. The film’s ensemble cast boasts a bevy of talented character actors with ruthless, memorable work including Eric Bogosian as a vindictive loan shark, Broadway and “Frozen” star Idina Menzel stunning as Howard’s angry wife Dinah and Lakeith Stanfield as Howard’s assistant and client valet. Former National Basketball Association star Kevin Garnett delivers a tremendous, intense performance as a fictionalized version of himself in one of the best acting performances by any major sports athlete, enhancing the film with an authentic, controlled turn that pushes the drama in new directions. The film’s breakout star is newcomer Julia Fox, who pulls focus away from Sandler in a wonderful supporting turn as Howard’s employee/mistress. Fox charms audiences in a way that feels manipulative but largely isn’t and her presence on screen is reminiscent of the dynamic energy Margot Robbie brought to her first major role in Martin Scorsese’s “The Wolf of Wall Street.” What sets “Gems” apart is the film’s relentless uncertainty where literally any outcome or repercussion can occur at any time. This keeps viewers apprehensively engaged and tense, forcing them into Howard’s corner as every action he takes feels like a miniature wager with ever-growing stakes. It’s a tremendous pairing of screenplay and performance that allows the chaotic pace of the film to genuine and earned rather than deliberately contrived. The Safdies, who have sought Sandler for the role of Howard for the better part of a decade, perfectly pen a character to fit the longtime comedic actor’s unique quirks in such a way that opens up Sandler to a world of new opportunities cinematically. Shot on 35 mm film, the visual artistry of “Gems” maintains a raw, gritty vibrancy and the Safdie brothers play with lights and colors to keep the dynamic energy of their screenplay alive regardless of the situation. This works especially well during a scene where Howard enters a club filled with blacklights which gives the screen an off blue hue complemented by a bright neon orange hoodie worn by a character antagonizing Howard that visually represents the story the Safdies are trying to tell. Sandler has an outside chance for a best actor nomination if newer members of the Academy rally behind him and the film, though it’s more likely their support will go to Eddie Murphy’s turn as a struggling comic turned movie star in Netflix’s “Dolemite Is My Name.” “Uncut Gems” clearly stands out as one of 2019’s best independent films and a dramatic career pinnacle for Sandler that needs to be seen on the big screen to truly be appreciated.",POSITIVE
"Jan 6, 2020"," Uncut Gems generates a propulsive energy throughout that will make you invigorated. Kinetically shot and packed with restless, breathtaking sequences, the film is anything you’ve seen before. It’s also a showcase for Adam Sandler, who squeezing a lot out of the narrative, delivers his most dazzling performance since Punch Drunk Love. Steeped in a busy, high-end New York atmosphere, the film marks another well-told chapter in the admirable filmography of the Safdie Brothers, authors of excellent indies about never-to-be-forgotten people - Daddy Longlegs (2009), Heaven Knows What (2014), and Good Time (2017). Once again, they teamed up with Ronald Bronstein for a brilliant screenplay. The story centers on Howard Ratner (Sandler), a Jewish-American jewelry store owner whose hectic life feels like riding an ultra-rapid rollercoaster. Not even us, the viewers, have time to breathe when peeking at Howard’s tense affairs and inextricable predicaments. Because of his gambling addiction, rough debt collectors, who work for loan sharks, frequently stop by his office and give him a hard time. Moreover, most of his employees are unsatisfied for having to deal with his financial imbroglios on a daily basis; his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), sees him as an irresponsible imbecile, while his lover and store collaborator, Julia (Julia Fox), was found on the verge of cheating on him with the R&B singer The Weekend (himself) at the latter’s party. On top of that, he embarks on a risky business with the NBA player Kevin Garnett (himself), who got obsessed with an uncut Ethiopian opal. Bursting with inventiveness and vibrancy, Uncut Gems is simultaneously nerve, guts, passion, and brain. A triumphant exercise in cinematic storytelling, stirred by the main character’s mercurial ups and downs. Very few recent films can boast this intensity, humor, and unpredictability. And the Safdies attained glory.",POSITIVE
"Jan 5, 2020"," Uncut Gems is directed by Josh and Benny Safdie and stars Adam Sandler, Kevin Garnett, Lakeith Stanfield, and Julia Fox. The story revolves around jeweler and perpetual gambler, Howard Ratner as he takes risk after risk and gamble after gamble to solve the problems in his life. The film has a lightning-fast pace and takes audiences on a journey that is uncomfortable, thrilling and disheartening.  The central theme of Uncut Gems is hope, or in this case, a hopeful character put into a world completely devoid of it. As the audience follows the story of Howard Ratner getting deeper with the loan sharks, his gambles get riskier and his actions get more dangerous. Ratner is a man always thinking his next big bet will be the one to cure all his ills and bring happiness back into his life. The truth of the matter is, his life was much more complicated and broken. Ratner’s family life is a disaster, on the verge of a divorce and a shaky relationship with his children. At work, Howard’s jewelry shop is not much better. Seemingly in deep debt, riddled with fake and counterfeit watches and at the mercy of high-level clientele, nothing seems to go right for Ratner, outside of Julia Fox’s character, Julia.  The casting of Uncut Gems is almost as impressive as its script. Adam Sandler shows up with arguably the best performance of his career. Sandler does not stop talking in the film it seems, a quality of his character, Ratner, who would just talk over and under any other dialogue in the film. This represents a sense of anxiety that underpins the film. Sandler’s anxiety to fix his life, the anxiety of those around him as things get hostile and the anxiety the audience feels over what will happen next all clash together to create a very tension-filled environment. To add to it, the film brings in basketball legend, Kevin Garnett. Garnett was larger than life and a show-stealer in every single scene he was in. As he towered over the other actors, the film does an impeccable job giving him a role that felt both believable and authentic, tying together with a real-life playoff series between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers.  Right by his side was Lakeith Stanfield. Stanfield is quickly becoming one of the best actors in Hollywood, with an impressive resume building around him. Uncut Gems was one of his best performances to date. The breakout star of the film was Julia Fox. Her character, also named Julia was Howard’s employee and mistress, the only true bright spot in Howard’s broken life, Julia truly felt believable in her role and as the film slowly put her into the driver’s seat as the primary co-star, she truly embraced it.  Josh and Benny Safdie brought a level of uncomfortable realism to Uncut Gems. Setting in during a specific NBA playoff series, having Kevin Garnet, NBA superstar, has a prominent role, bringing in stars like The Weeknd to play versions of themselves brought a sense of real-world setting while also blending in elements of fantasy, and unexplainable moments. The one word to describe Uncut Gems is anxiety-inducing. The film gives the audience gut punch after gut punch but unlike Joker, a film that provides the gut punches back to back, Uncut Gems does something worse, it builds you up first.  The script of the film revolves around Howard’s gambling and has the audiences also join in, except to gamble his life and the plot of the film. You end up feeling like Howard has a chance to make it right and on many occasions, he almost does before the film hits you with the sledgehammer of reality. Howard was never going to win, and that sense of hopeless hope is perfectly portrayed by Adam Sandler.  Overall, Uncut Gems is perfectly directed, written and acted, featuring breakout performances by Kevin Garnett and Julia Fox, and Adam Sandler’s career-best, playing a hopeful character in a world devoid of it. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020"," For the vast majority of his career, Sandler has been content playing obnoxious dolts in such low-I.Q. fare as Big Daddy, Grown Ups, and Just Go with It. Thanks to his indiscriminate fans, he makes millions from these imbecilic features, so why exert any energy or employ any imagination? (My favorite quote regarding his relationship with his audience comes from Slant’s review of Jack and Jill: “More bluntly than ever before (and that’s saying something), Sandler uses an entire film to let his loyal fans know that he thinks they’re all a bunch of stupid assholes.” But I digress.) Pair Sandler with a talented director, though, and evidence of his abilities shines through. Paul Thomas Anderson with Punch-Drunk Love, James L. Brooks with Spanglish, Noah Baumbach with The Meyerowitz Stories — these are among the very few filmmakers who have made the actor straighten up and give a damn. Add to that list Benny and Josh Safdie, the brothers behind Uncut Gems. The Safdies were among the first to reveal to the world that Robert Pattinson really could act — check out the trio’s intense drama from 2017, Good Time (reviewed here) — and here they similarly cast a spotlight on Sandler. Written and directed by the Safdies (with Ronald Bronstein also serving as a co-scripter, as he did on Good Time), Uncut Gems finds Sandler cast as Howard Ratner, a small-time New York jeweler who tests the patience of practically everyone who meets him. His wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) no longer loves him and wants a divorce; his mistress Julia (photographer, filmmaker, and former Playboy model Julia Fox in an impressive acting debut) loves him but finds his jealous streak to be a major problem. Howard’s biggest fault, though, might be his gambling addiction, as it has led to him owing a sizable sum to a loan shark who just also happens to be his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian). But Howard reasons that his acquisition of an uncut opal straight from an Ethiopian mine will save him, since he plans to sell it at auction for over a million dollars. Since the bulk of Uncut Gems involves people constantly screaming at each other, jittery moviegoers might want to seek entertainment elsewhere — honestly, the characters’ hostility, accentuated by the up-close-and-personal camerawork by Darius Khondji and the rapid-fire editing by Benny Safdie and Bronstein, works on the nerves as effectively as the shock sequences from any superior horror film. And no one is louder than Sandler’s Howard Ratner, who’s irritating and generally unlikable but, in a few (very few) key scenes, also strangely appealing in the manner of a scrappy underdog taking on the merciless world surrounding him. I’m not on the “Give Adam Sandler an Oscar nomination” bandwagon — I’ve easily seen at least five leading male performances more varied and more interesting, including the one by Pattinson in The Lighthouse (reviewed here) — but he’s certainly up to the task presented to him by the Safdies. Granted, some might watch Uncut Gems and see the actor merely playing yet another loud-mouth boor, and they would be correct. But in this case, there’s conviction — not to mention an actual character — behind the shouting and the scheming, and that makes all the difference.",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020"," These characters aren’t really human beings, they resemble something more akin to impulsive animals. Sure, that may appeal to some, but few films have a character slate as potentially off-putting as this one does.  Based on audience reaction, this movie is an example of the growing critic/audience divide, but in reverse: Critics love the film, audiences seem to really struggle with it. Working at breakneck speed for two unrelenting hours, Uncut Gems is a frenetic, suspense/thriller featuring Adam Sandler as the somewhat unlikely centerpiece of the latest film from brothers Josh & Benny Safdie (Good Time).For those familiar with the Safdie Brothers, they don’t do things half-way, and Uncut Gems starts fast and only accelerates headlong into a series of surprising and exhausting scenes. Sandler is at the heart of every moment, delivering a performance that has the potential to turn the tide with many of his most dismissive critics, who have attributed Sandler’s recent oeuvre as lazy, uninspired, and not particularly funny.As Howard Ratner, Sandler is a jeweler, running an appointment-only high-end jewelry store in Manhattan. He also has a gambling addiction and frequently strings along clients and bookies for thousands and thousands of dollars, robbing Peter to pay Paul and all the rest.We learn from the opening of the film, set in 2012, a rare rock discovered from an Ethiopian mine is going to be the catalyst that sets Howard on a rabbit-hole like journey into chaos. When the rock, basically an uncut opal, arrives at his shop, he is in the midst of haggling with NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (in an extended cameo) and his entourage. When Garnett becomes dissatisfied and is ready to bounce, Howard, desperate to keep his client happy, shows Garnett the opal and inexplicably allows him to “borrow” it for good luck for the night’s game.What follows is an rather insane shell game where Howard is dodging debtors, making side-deals, and trying to not only keep the peace with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and his children, but also his mistress Julia (Julia Fox).The Safdies care little about whether you like their characters or not, and Howard is about as insufferable and unlikable as they come. Sandler’s commitment to this performance however, is one of the biggest surprises of 2019, maybe even the decade. As Howard, it serves as a reminder that, as we have seen before in movies like Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, and The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), his dramatic chops are significant.

"Jan 4, 2020"," You have to hand it to the Safdie Brothers: They start Uncut Gems in Adam Sandler’s ass and never let up the intensity. Their latest crime thriller after the breakout success of the Robert Pattinson-starring Good Time is a relentless onslaught of people talking over each other, people in constant motion, people always hustling, doing so much that it becomes too much, all adding up into a certain milieu of New Yorkness that feels simultaneously authentic and performative. The film, which cowriters and codirectors Josh and Benny Safdie have talked about making for a decade, is an overstuffed menagerie of NYC references (shout-out to Smith & Wollensky steaks), nods to Jewish cultural practices, and exponentially irresponsible decisions that would make any money-conscious viewer increasingly horrified. Adam Sandler works well as the guide into this glitteringly manic world, but Uncut Gems often feels like a cacophony of bluster without much emotional payoff. Sporting fake teeth, wire-rimmed transition lenses, and a baggy black leather jacket, Sandler stars as diamond dealer Howard Ratner, a man who can never get out of his own way. He’s known to nearly everyone in NYC’s Diamond District, mostly because he’s always ducking someone: Estranged wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), who wants to finalize their divorce proceedings. Employee Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who is responsible for bringing clients into the store, who keeps asking Howard about the stash of Rolexes he’s entrusted to him, high-dollar items that Demany wants to move on his own. Mistress Julia (Julia Fox, whose ass is now a source of constant meme fascination on Film Twitter), who barely shows up to work at Howie’s store but who lives at an apartment he funds, who sort of talks about building a career as a photographer but who mostly just seems like a party girl. And, most importantly, a couple of enforcers, the burly Phil (Keith Williams Richards) and Nico (Tommy Kominik), who muscle their way into the store at the behest of loanshark Arno (Eric Bogosian from Succession, exceptional), whom Howard owes $100,000. Howard is endlessly pushed and pulled in numerous directions, juggling the demands of his family and his jewelry store and all the people coming out of the shadows demanding money he took from them and didn’t pay back—interrupting his workday and his walk down the street and his daughter’s performance at a school play. But the man is an addict, and an addict is always thinking about his next score, so Howie’s persistent fascination isn’t what he can actually do to make amends. Instead, his obsession is a gigantic hunk of opal that was discovered in Ethiopia’s Welo Mine in 2010 and which Howie finally gets his hands on in 2012—the titular uncut gems that Howie believes are his next big payout. 415 carats at $3,000 a carat, totaling at least $1 million at auction, enough money for Howie to pay his debts and divorce his wife and start a new life with Julia. “That’s history right there,” Howie says of the gem discovered by African Jews in a continent far, far away, but it’s Howie’s future, too. Uncut Gems is about everything that goes wrong after the opal appears in Howie’s life, though, and the Safdie Brothers layer it on fast and furious—so much so that it often feels like the movie is rushing along without your total involvement in it. The movie’s rhythm is built by Howie’s manic energy, by his desire to always jump forward into a fantasy life and how constantly he is dragged back into the futility of his real world, and to his credit Sandler thoroughly inhabits that persona by balancing the character’s self-absorbed confidence and pathetic petulance. It’s in how the man cajoles doubters who don’t want to accept another sports bet by Howie, who can’t bear to see the man throwing money away again.  It’s in how completely simpatico he is with Julia, who hands over with ease a necklace she stole from pop star The Weeknd so that Howie can pawn it, and yet how ashamed he is when he realizes his children are picking up on the fact that he’s stepping out on his marriage. The jettisoning between the highest of highs and lowest of lows is familiar if you’ve seen any addiction movie, like Mississippi Grind or Requiem for a Dream, but it’s surprising how well Sandler pulls this off, how much hope and desperation he imbues into a character who could have easily been a caricature. In fact, Uncut Gems is full of surprises that are more fulfilling than the movie’s main narrative. Sam Lisenco’s production design and Darius Khondji’s precise cinematography, which together capture the intimacy of events like Passover dinner and the familial lines of loyalty and resentment within such a space, or the chaotic capitalism of the Diamond District, with its stacked-on-each-other stores, capital-C Characters, labyrinthine hallways, and secret back rooms. Menzel as the put-upon Dinah, leaning fully into “fuck you, pay me” energy by fitting into her poufy neon pink bat mitzvah dress while reading Howie for filth.  Bogosian as the weary, worn-down Arno, whose relationship with Howie takes on different weight about midway through the movie, whose judgmental looks toward Sandler’s character hold greater depth. And Kevin Garnett is an unexpectedly fantastic revelation as, well, himself, playing a version of the Garnett who in 2012 is a leader on the Boston Celtics as they prepare for the NBA’s Eastern Conference finals. Enthralled by the opal and the possibility that it provides good luck, Garnett adds additional mysticism to a film that already indulges Howie’s idea of himself (“Aren’t we supposed to be the Chosen People?” Howie asks his also-Jewish gastroenterologist), and the script from the Safdies and regular collaborator Ronald Bronstein builds effective friction between two men who are each convinced of their own singularity. “You fucked up, and you are a fuckup,” someone says to Howie; “It’s about fucking winning,” Howie later says of his own approach to life; and Uncut Gems examines the wide gap between those two statements, in how people view us vs. how we view ourselves. Does the ending undercut that tension? Sure, especially once you realize toward which characters the film’s sympathies lie. But before that point, Uncut Gems is a fairly entertaining exploration of the glossy allure of wealth, of believing your own myth, and of the corruptive mistakes inherent to both. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 4, 2020"," Sandler becomes the dentally challenged New York City jewelry/gem dealer perpetually looking for the score of a lifetime while walking a tightrope on the precipice of destruction every moment of this tense, funny, and fraught film. Under the innovative direction of Josh and Benny Safdie (Good Time, Heaven Knows What), Adam Sandler’s gives the best performance of his career. But there’s so much more going on in this film. It grabs you from the opening scene showing a bloody, horrific injury to a jewel miner in Ethiopia, switching to a mesmerizing psychedelic color travelogue through Howard’s colon and ending out his butt! It’s a bit of a bizarre transition.  Outwardly Howard is an established jeweler, but his real vocation is trying to cover his gambling debts. He especially loves to bet on the NBA and loves even more being able to rub elbows selling high priced jewelry to high profile sports figures. Howard’s showroom is very informational. The way jewelry is sold in New York’s diamond district is unique. There are buzzers to let customers in  the first set of glass doors by someone known or escorted in by someone known. And there’s no getting out unless you’re buzzed out both walls. It’s game on! When Boston Celtic’s Kevin Garnett becomes obsessed with owning the huge stolen uncut opal Howard has acquired from that Ethiopian mine seen in the opening scene. Howard is putting the gem up for auction, for an ultimate score. This film takes place in 2012 when Garnett was still playing and he believes that this stone is his personal good luck charm. The scenes of him admiring the fiery opals as he turns it in his hands show how much he relishes having this item in his possession. Garnett does a more than credible job as an actor.  Howard doesn’t give the stone up easily. He talks Garnett into giving him his championship ring as collateral. Garnett wants the opal in his locker during a playoff game. As with so many moments during this movie you want to shout, “Don’t do it!” as Howard uses the ring to make more bad decisions. He just never learns. Even having a couple enforcers hang him upside down outside a window many floors above the street threatening to bounce him on his head can’t convince him to make better choices. Writers, Josh and Benny Safdie with Ronald Bronstein, contribute to the frantic situations with colorful dialogue, layered at a fast pace. You’ll hear more than 400 F-bombs. Can’t believe they were all written into the script, but we’re sure a number more were thrown in. It’s yelling, non-stop, so loud, your ears will be ringing. One of the major sources of nervous tension throughout is the sound design. This is a noise machine of a movie with 14 listed credits in the Sound Department. Multiple conversations, including yelling and screaming create a constant din in the background of Howard’s jewelry store, yet it’s always possible to catch the thread of his speech. Quite an achievement. Sandler runs with it, managing to infuse Howard with some of the smart-aleck, bumbling qualities of his past comedic characters that infuriated audiences, as in Grown Ups and more. Sandler adds so much more to Howard’s personality. There’s more desperation and scheming, but also a desire to try to do right by his family. The scene at a Passover Seder brings that all into focus. He’s at his best and worst, all at once, but, because of his actions, it’s hard to like Howard, but easy to be frustrated by his actions.  The constant movement of cinematographer Darius Khondji’s camera also contributes to the nervous feel of almost every scene.  It must’ve been hard following Sandler as he is constantly moving. He bobs and weaves as if he is always on the make, looking for his next deal or a way to fix the last bad one. There’s a grainy quality to the shots that gives off an ominous feeling that something dangerous is always on Howard’s horizon. Howard stays married, in name only, to Dinah (Idina Menzel) for the sake of his two children. She’s gad enough. The on-going affair with sexy, knockout, Julia, one of his employees,(Julia Fox) is an open secret. Fox is a surprise delight in this film as a vixen who has a love/hate relationship with Howard. Julia is New York sassy and alternately ditzy in a pivotal role helping Howard facilitate his big bet finale. She is adorable, stunning, smart, dumb, but may really love Howard.  LaKeith Stanfield, fresh off his sedate but amusing detective performance in Knives Out does a 180 degree turn in this film as Howard’s tough, backstabbing employee Demany. He procures high-profile customers like Garnett and The Weekend who become the target of Howard’s ire for messing around with his girl. But it’s not just what Howard does. It’s how Sandler manifests the characterization. His wheels are always turning, trying to figure out how to beat his pursuers by making the next deal. It’s so frustrating how Howard always manages to turn what should be big wins into major screw-ups. You’ll want to yell at the screen!  The earsplitting sound and layered dialogue coupled with the Safdies’ frenetic directing and pace create a film that careens off the screen bombarding your brain. Watching Adam Sandler is like watching a sped up version of dodge ball, talking non-stop to justify his every move. And once you get into his rhythm, it’s hard to look away. Adam Sandler has given life to an unforgettable character in a “gem” of a performance. ",POSITIVE
"Jan 3, 2020"," Perhaps the most enjoyable film to be this relentlessly unpleasant to watch, Uncut Gems has the sound and feel of a hurried fork stabbing at and missing food while on a blind date your mom set up. It’s Panic Attack: The Movie, featuring an actor with a stupid face that is genetically designed to make you want violence to happen to it. That’s not an opinion. That’s almost exactly what Idina Menzel explicitly says in this movie. If the voice of Elsa says your face is dumb, your face is dumb. Those are the rules. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler)—perhaps the most deliciously on-the-nose name for a shitbag character—is a jeweler and degenerate gambler. He spends what little time he has that’s not taken up running away from people trying to collect on his debts sleeping with his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox). As all adulterous, greedy weasels do, Howard has a plan to make a big score. This involves exploiting a group of Jewish-African miners by fleecing them out of a stone filled with uncut black opals. However, Howard is stupider than he is miserly. He tries to impress NBA star Kevin Garnett by showing him the piece. Garnett becomes obsessed with it, demanding Howard let him borrow it overnight for good luck during a playoff game. This sets off a chain of what is either bad luck, quality karma, or divine smiting, depending on whether you think a sentient God would intentionally make a face like Adam Sandler’s. Writer Ronald Bronstein and writers/directors Josh and Benny Safdie offer a plot that basically asks “Okay, but what would make this situation even worse?” Virtually every scene features people yelling at one another or talking loudly at the same time. This is somehow made even more anxiety inducing by the songs in Daniel Lopatin’s score, which are basically trippy space jams. Why is it more awful to grind out a scene with violent gangsters trapped inside a cage when that scene is set to Eastern meditation music? You’ll have to ask the Safdie brothers the alchemy behind that one. One of the best things about Uncut Gems is how well it steers into the palpable unlikability of its lead character. Too often, films with dirtbag protagonists encourage the audience to sympathize with them. That cannot be done with Howard Ratner. He exists beyond sympathy. He exists as a distillation of all the gross personality traits no human should have. The tension doesn’t come from a kinship with the movie’s subject but from a desire to escape the cinematic cage you voluntarily walked into. At a time when so many films seem painfully contrived to provide only expected reactions, the discomfort of Uncut Gems feels gloriously new. Repeat viewings likely reveal dense, heady themes about Judaism, cosmic purpose, and the depravity of capitalism. Yet, the thought of sitting through that mental meat grinder again is tantamount to intentionally watching any other Adam Sandler movie for the first time on purpose. Once is enough to declare Uncut Gems unpleasurably brilliant.",POSITIVE
"Jan 2, 2020"," Everything you may have heard or read about Uncut Gems is true: it’s tough to watch, especially at the start. In-your-face filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie throw a lot at us in the opening sequence, which establishes the tone of their movie and the frenzied life of its protagonist, a high-stakes jewelry store owner (Adam Sandler) who works in the diamond district of Manhattan. Anyone who’s ever spent a little time there will recognize the cacophony of life on West 47th Street, both inside the showrooms and on the sidewalk. This is amplified by Daniel Lopatin’s score, which is loud and every bit as off-putting as Sandler’s character—at first. It’s Sandler’s inherent likability that helps make Uncut Gems palatable. His character is insufferable but somehow fascinating, a compulsive gambler and wheeler-dealer who traffics in sports memorabilia and other valuables as well as jewelry. He not only skirts disaster at every turn, he courts it, making one risky decision after another. Sometimes he comes out ahead, sometimes not, and he seems to accept this perpetual high-wire act as the norm in his life. Even taking that as a given, the crush of incidents that occur back-to-back over the course of the film push Sandler out on a ledge, literally and figuratively. He’s impressed by one of his newest customers, NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself), and foolishly loans him his latest acquisition, a misshapen rock mined in Ethiopia and studded with precious stones. The moment he lets this highly desirable piece out of his hands we know he’s made a mistake. He’s borrowed against it in a complicated domino scheme that involves thugs and hoodlums who mean it when they threaten violence. Meanwhile, Sandler makes a half-hearted attempt to maintain a family life in the suburbs with his enraged wife (Idina Menzel) and kids while keeping a mistress (Julia Fox) housed in a Manhattan apartment. Here again we see him on a collision course that’s bound to end badly. Everything he does is in extremis. The Safdie brothers, cinematographer Darius Khondji and editor Ronald Bronstein (who also shares screenplay credit) maintain a frenzied pace, with occasional moments of relief—like a family Passover Seder—and make even the most absurd turns of plot play realistically. Nothing feels contrived or out of place in the world that Sandler’s character inhabits. 
Ultimately, my only criticism of Uncut Gems is that it takes a long time to play out and feels it. Even so, it’s a movie that commands your attention and lingers afterwards, as does Sandler’s intensely focused performance. This tops everything he’s done before and is worthy of an Oscar.

"Jan 1, 2020","Sandler is fascinating to watch in this role as the shady wheeler dealer Howard Ratner. He whipsaws from manic emotional highs, tenderness and mischief to devastating lows. Watching Ratner desperately juggle bets and deals is something to behold.",POSITIVE
"Jan 1, 2020"," Uncut Gems casts Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner, a slick, fast-talking jeweler who attempts to pull off a series of high-stakes bets to pay off the various debt collectors on his tail. Filmmakers Benny and Josh Safdie have infused Uncut Gems with an impressively stylish sensibility that’s reflected in its myriad of attributes, with, especially, Daniel Lopatin’s ominous score and Darius Khondji’s lush, captivating visuals effectively perpetuating the Safdies’ visceral sensibilities. And although the picture boasts an absolutely spellbinding turn from Sandler, with the actor delivering an impressively transformative performance, Uncut Gems‘ episodic structure paves the way for an exceedingly erratic midsection that’s rarely as engrossing and tense as one might’ve anticipated – with the film’s arms-length atmosphere compounded by the protagonist’s somewhat inexplicable behavior (ie why doesn’t he just stop?) The ongoing inclusion of admittedly absorbing sequences (eg Howard attempts to repair a security door in his shop) proves effective at buoying one’s interest on a fairly regular basis, at least, and yet Uncut Gems‘ lack of connective tissue ensures that the whole thing hardly concludes on the taut note that the Safdies have clearly intended – which is a shame, certainly, given that the movie does boast a whole handful of better-than-average elements. (Sandler is indeed just that good here, despite the always-distracting fake teeth.)",NEUTRAL
"Dec 31, 2019"," BY DAN TABOR FILM CRITIC There were several points while watching Uncut Gems that my Apple Watch began to go off letting me know that my heart rate was getting out of control, and that I needed to take a moment to “breath.” Watching the film in a darkened theater, I felt very much like its protagonist – trapped, anxious and fearing for my own sanity. It was during the third haptic Apple Watch alarm that I knew I was witnessing one of the best films this year. Uncut Gems the newest film by the Safdie Brothers (Good Time) begins in Ethiopia, in the aftermath of a bloody mining accident. In all the chaos, a rare black opal worth at least a million dollars is smuggled out of the mine by a pair of entrepreneurial miners and ends up in the hands of New York diamond district Jewish jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler). Ratner who is a compulsive gambling addict, an adulterer and neck deep in debt is looking for an easy out with the rare stone. That’s when now-retired NBA star Kevin Garnett, playing none other than himself, is brought into his showroom and has a spiritual connection with the opal, and asks to borrow it for luck. This is during the 2010 playoffs between the Celtics and the Sixers.  When Garnett, pulls off a series best with the gem in his possession, he isn’t so quick to let go of the gem that is due for auction, as Ratner is just trying to make it through the Passover holiday with both of his kneecaps intact. While I don’t consider myself an Adam Sandler fan, and haven’t sought out a film of his since high school, given the premise and directors I was intrigued to say the least. Unlike Robert Pattinson in Good Time, something remains pure and almost redeemable about Sandler’s gambling-addicted degenerate jeweler. This empathy seriously amps up the tension in the Safdie Brother’s trademark gritty underworld, as we see Ratner dig himself deeper and deeper still believing his big score is just over the horizon. It’s a tense watch, but one that gives the actor better known for his dick and fart humor the chance to show his detractors, just what he can do with the right material. Sandler is electric on screen with his manic take on a man struggling to keep his head above the surface in shark infested waters. Sandler is surrounded by a cast that includes Idina Menzel, the always great Lakeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett who all deliver very grounded takes, contrary to Sandler’s larger than life personae. Ratner feels at times like he is plugged into something almost ethereal once the gem is in his possession, which is similar to Garnett who we witness glimpses something spectacular, when he looks into the opal. It’s an almost mystical layer of subtext that for me brings something new to the loan shark film genre, a very dark sub-genre in Chinese cinema. Like other Safdie brother’s films Gems has a bleak documentarian look that to me felt like it was looking at New York as the unsafe urban jungle that was the playground of exploitation directors did in the ‘70s. Uncut Gems is tense, sleaze-filled trip through the dark underbelly of New York’s Jeweler’s Row. Sandler is gloriously unhinged on screen in what is hands-down the performance of his lifetime. Gems is a complex narrative that has this ethereal subtext as well as an interesting cultural deep dive into Ratner’s relationship with his African American hip-hop and sports clientele. It’s a very nuanced script, with a lot of moving parts, that never leans into stereotypes, but also isn’t simply content with being a thrill ride. The Safdie Brother’s assisted by Ronald Bronstein have crafted a masterpiece that manages to get its audience to side with its tragically flawed protagonist and even root for him in a third act that left me speechless and almost gave me a heart attack, as Ratner goes for broke one final time.",POSITIVE

"Dec 30, 2019"," If you think you know Adam Sandler aka the Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison personas, think again. Starring in the Safdie Brothers’ film “Uncut Gems,” Sandler shows us the depth of skill he possesses, never relenting and giving us one of the best performances of the year. The film opens to a brutal scene as the infamous Black Opal is being mined. The camera takes us to an injured worker, then dragging us into a cave and down the depths of a mine where two men chisel away to unearth a rare gem. We are transported into the gem, and seemingly into the universe where all things are possible, but on the other side of that, we find ourselves on the wrong end of Howard Ratner (Sandler), a NYC jeweler who is having a colonoscopy. If that’s not bad enough, we learn that Ratner is up to his ears in debt to the wrong kind of people, thanks to his insatiable gambling habit. Awaiting the arrival of this precious gem, his knight in shining armor, which is in his mind is more valuable than life itself. He is now set to auction it to the highest bidder and get himself out of his proverbial hole. Ratner is the kind of man who flaunts his wealth, deceiving you into thinking he’s the guy in the know, and the one to know. But beneath his ostentatious exterior is a man barely staying afloat, all the while making one poor decision after another. He robs Peter to pay Paul. He’s cheating on his wife and putting his family in harm’s way. He’s also gambling money he doesn’t have by pawning precious items. He’s an absolute train wreck and we watch as he makes these decisions which catapult him in a variety of directions, never knowing if we should uncover our eyes and look. Ratner is a deplorable protagonist in this story. We are offended by his words, actions, and subsequent reactions to his consequences. There is absolutely no redeeming qualities of this man. But for some reason, he attracts high-end cleintele the likes of the pro basketball player Kevin Garnett, thanks to the paid lackey Demany (LaKeith Stanfield). We find ourselves a part of Ratner’s despicable situation and wonder if his saving grace, the rare black opal, truly can save him. While we cannot (hopefully) relate to or understand this man, it is like driving past a gruesome car wreck. We don’t want to look, but we have to. We have to see the carnage and watch what happens next. “Uncut Gems” is quite possibly the most personally and intrinsically polarizing films to date. I was undeniably uncomfortable throughout the entire film thanks to dizzying camera work that felt as if it screamed, “I’m in your face! Do something about it!” and a musical score that gave a sense of constant fingernails down the chalkboard, accentuating the craziness of it all. If that wasn’t enough, the frenetic energy induced by the dialogue and reactionary dialogue consistently on the highest level possible, sends you into a fight or flight motion. For those who stick with it and don’t let their sympathetic nervous system rule their decisions, the final act is well worth the investment. Sandler brilliantly creates Ratner, pushing his own boundaries and exhausting us as we watch. He’s crude. His language is as offensive as his actions, but there is a reality to him that is not only intriguing but engaging. That reality comes in part by the Safdie’s documentary or hand-held cinematography. We’re in the tight confines of the jewelry store, on lock down, and the constraints that Ratner feels, we feel. The camera captures that franticly chaotic internal mechanism called Ratner’s mind. He flits and fleets as he processes information and makes decisions, all poor ones according to a reasonable person’s mind. The pace of the film is equally frenetic making us feel as if we are a young child being dragged against our will as Ratner chases his dreams of finally making it big. He’s running for his life, holding our hand and pulling us along, trying to cover his tracks, balance his kids’ lives, and hide his unique love life. The music punctuates the fast paced life he leads which is inherently unnerving. While this isn’t a film I enjoyed, the writers-directors certainly do it justice by making this an experiential film. We, the viewer, experience the emotions, high at all times, of the stress of our main character. Achieving this cinematic brilliance, however, is at a cost. That being said, no matter how disastrous Ratner’s life is, it’s imperative to know how it all ends and Sandler shockingly does so. It’s an ending that will stay with you and we all know that endings can make or break a film and this one makes it.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019","It's a full-bodied role born by the Brothers Safdie (Josh and Benny), capitalizing on both Sandler's manic obnoxiousness and tender underbelly.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 29, 2019",Uncut Gems should be lauded for its commitment to embracing nihilism and chaos.,POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019"," As many of us do, the arrival of the year’s end is a time for me to look back. If I were to sum it up, 2019 was all about surprise. Putting aside the absolute insanity of our politics, the year in film has been wild as hell. We saw both the Star Wars and MCU franchises come to a temporary end. We saw films about cathartic cults, flicks involving doppelgangers, and a number of movies examining class warfare. Perhaps strangest of all, we saw one of the best performances of the year delivered by Adam Sandler. Maybe it’s not so strange, though! I’ll grant you that a cursory look through Sandler’s filmography is dire, to say the least. The majority of his films are bro-ey comedies where he’s doing little more than dicking around with his friends and getting paid for it. I generally don’t begrudge people enjoying a thing, and I’ve read numerous times that Sandler is a genuinely good dude. The sad fact is that his comedies aren’t for me. It doesn’t matter if they’re for me, because his movies have made billions at the box office. Quite a lot of people love his comedy, and in order to be a successful comedian, you’ve got to have a keen understanding of human behavior. Sandler might play the fool, but he’s far from an idiot. He pays attention and files those little behavioral tics away for later. Once in a while, he’ll even explore the dark side. Along with his comedies, he’s played a jaded movie star in Funny People, a man annihilated by 9/11 in Reign Over Me, and a desperately lonely entrepreneur in Punch-Drunk Love. When Sandler has the right material — and I’m not kidding here — he can not only hold his own against anyone, but he can also deliver acting that’s skilled and nuanced. Sandler continues to prove that with his bravura performance in the new film Uncut Gems. It’s by no means a film for everyone, but those attuned to its panicky rhythms won’t forget it. Some people experience addiction through their struggles with drugs or alcohol. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a little different. There’s a great yawning void inside him that he fills with near-constant chaos. How did he get to that point? We’re never told outright, but brief asides tell us everything we need to know about his likely beginnings and probable end. Howard operates a store in the midst of Manhattan’s Diamond District. It’s small, claustrophobic, and the dual security entrances give Howard a much-needed buffer between himself and whatever likely pissed-off person he’s dealing with. He’s constantly hustling, and his associate Demany lures in potential clients for wildly overpriced sales. Surrounded by valuable stones, Howard yearns for the deal that will push him over the top. The acquisition of a black opal from Ethiopia might be the deal he’s waiting for. Sure, Howard feels a connection to it due to the Ethiopian Jews who unearthed it. His larger connection is the upcoming auction of the black opal and its potential value of over one million dollars. Making the deal even sweeter is the arrival of basketball player Kevin Garnett, who sees the opal and is bewitched by it. He asks Howard if he can “hold onto it” for luck at that evening’s game and offers his blinged-out championship ring for collateral. Howard says yes, and this is only the first of many, many poor decisions he’ll make. You’d think that would be stressful enough for Howard, yet he immediately pawns Kevin’s ring, then takes the money and places a ridiculously big bet on the game. This gets the attention of his brother-in-law and loan shark Arno (Eric Bogosian), to whom he owes a lot of money. He’s accompanied by Phil (Keith Williams Richards) and Nico (Tommy Kominik), two legbreakers who would happily kick Howard’s ass up and down the street. There’s also Howard’s wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), who views him as a loudmouthed joke, and his girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox), who has her own struggles. In the past, we’ve talked about the twin mistakes filmgoers sometimes make with 1) assuming that the main character of a film should be likable and 2) assuming that a film should be enjoyable. That is nowhere close to correct here, and while Uncut Gems is a hell of a good movie, it’s also a two-hour panic attack of a film that follows around an unrepentant scumbag. Trust me, you won’t be bounding out of the theater with a spring in your step. Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie have directed a grimy and explosive film that would be right at home in a Times Square theater in the 1970s. Set in a New York City thoroughly scrubbed clean by gentrification, the Safdies specialize in digging between the cracks and showing us the desperate people who view every day as a battle. It’s that desperation that fuels the film, and their pacing is relentless. Layered on top is a pulsing synth-based soundtrack by experimental electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never. He creates a constant environment of unease, never quite allowing viewers to settle in and relax. Written by the Safdies and Ronald Bronstein, the screenplay is a marvel on several fronts. First, it excels at dropping us into the pure chaos of Howard’s world and revealing character through action. We stick with Howard’s point of view throughout, yet time is always taken to show people reacting to him with bemusement, annoyance, contempt, and rage. The script also understands that, regardless of what a person is addicted to, addiction is a black hole that cannot be filled. That’s the point of addiction, and the screenplay never moralizes and treats Howard as a cautionary tale. We’re dropped into his shoes and taken for the ride, whether we like it or not. What makes the ride bearable is a lead actor that’s innately likable. Not everybody in film has that warmth, and while I’m a great admirer of Edward Norton’s skill as an actor, he often comes off as cold. If he had played Howard, the movie would have been a nightmare. Adam Sandler’s charisma helps to draw us in, and we worry about the end result of his poor decisions. Howard is a perpetual motion machine, always moving, talking, plotting. He lives on the edge, and he’s driven by delusional goals. Sandler has the fanatic’s gleam in his eye, and he always knows when to crank it up or throttle it back depending on the situation. It’s a performance of enormous skill and discipline that deserves recognition. Uncut Gems is very much a Your-Mileage-May-Vary kind of film. The Safdie Brothers have zero interest in making a crowd-pleaser. Their artistic ambitions are highly specific, and the kinds of people that adore Adam Sandler movies like Billy Madison and The Wedding Singer will positively despise his newest film. That’s fine since real art has a distinctive point of view and the courage to stand by it. Uncut Gems.is art and it’s one of the best films of the year.",POSITIVE
"Dec 29, 2019"," Another New York City-set, half-baked, hardcore effort from the Safdie brothers, Benny and Josh, this one produced by no less than Martin Scorsese, “Uncut Gems,” as many have noted, features Adam Sandler’s best performance since “Punch Drunk Love.” As the diamond district jeweler and degenerate gambler Howard Ratner, Sandler is also relentlessly one-note in a monotonously plotted film. That note he hits might be impressively high. But eventually, you grow tired of it, or at least I did. It’s 2012, and Howard has a beautiful, unhappy wife (Idina Menzel of “Frozen II”) and family and a house in the suburbs. He also shares a lush Manhattan apartment with sexy mistress Julia (Julia Fox), who also works for him in his small shop. After establishing that Howard owes money to some dangerous people, including a loan shark relative named Arno (Eric Bogosian) and his collectors, we meet Boston Celtics basketball star Kevin Garnett (himself), who arrives with a retinue at Howard’s shop, where such items as bedazzled “Gremlins” figures are for sale. The screenplay by Safdie regular Ronald Bronstein and Josh and Benny Safdie asks us to believe that Garnett becomes enamored of uncut opals from Ethiopia. In fact, Garnett believes that he has a spiritual bond with the gems (don’t ask me) and exchanges an NBA championship ring for temporary ownership. Howard says the opals are worth over $1 million and has them listed in an upcoming auction. He needs to get the rocks back from Garnett in time for the auction. The first thing Howard does is hock Garnett’s ring to place a bet. Like all stories about degenerate gamblers, “Uncut Gems” is a 135-minute race against the time when Howard can no longer cover his losses or pretend that he has not hocked everything to feed his monster and accept his punishment. I don’t have much patience for this kind of self-destructive behavior, which also collaterally destroys families and friendships. Here’s the film’s formula: Howard gets into a tight scrape. He gets out of it. Sometimes, he gets beaten up. He raises money to place bets and watches the Celtics games he has bet on, screaming profane commentary. We also get “Clockwork Orange”-like music and dopey, “Fantastic Voyage”-like glimpses inside the magical opals. In between this often tedious monotony, Howard squeezes in a Seder dinner with his extended family, including a glaring Arno. I did not like Howard’s company. Fox is an impressive figure in the unfaithful mistress role. Watertown’s Bogosian brings a convincing edge to tough-guy loan shark Arno. The Weeknd is good as himself. As the family patriarch, Judd Hirsch has Howard’s and probably everyone else’s number. LaKeith Stanfield is a standout in what might be described as the Samuel Jackson role, and Jonathan Aranbayev brings a knowing look of disappointment to one of Howard’s sons. But like previous Safdie brothers efforts “Good Time” and “Heaven Knows What,” “Uncut Gems” is a bit like the cubic zirconia of gambler movies.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 28, 2019"," Comic actor Adam Sandler is on the road that could lead to an Oscar nomination, Dame Judi and Sir Ian sing alongside a clowder of cats, and the Jumanji gang returns to swap avatars. There’s something for everyone this Christmas week, including a raw drama, a treasured piece of musical theater, and adventurous fun. Three releases – “Uncut Gems,” “Cats,” and “Jumanji: The Next Level” – are seeking your attention. UNCUT GEMS: Joshua and Benjamin Safdie are New York City brothers who made home movies when they were kids, having been influenced by their father who took them to see all manner of films, as both a ritual in a family roiled by divorce and a rite of passage. In 2007, when Josh was 23 and Benny was 21, they made their first feature and haven’t looked back. Depending on their movie, the brothers each contribute to key production roles (producer, screenwriter, director, cinematographer, film editor, and actor). They’ve drawn attention at film festivals around the world, including being nominated for the Palme d’Or (the grand prize) at Cannes in 2017 for their potent and gritty “Good Time” starring Robert Pattinson. And, the brothers have drawn the attention of director Martin Scorsese, to whom they’ve been compared. There’s a reason Scorsese is an executive producer on the Safdies’ “Uncut Gems,” a tense, raucous, unflinching exploration of ego, addiction, and delusion. Scorsese certainly sees his own eager young self, understands the Safdies’ expressive youth, and recognizes a creative bond that makes the three of them cinematic blood brothers. Not only does the movie take neorealist filmmaking to a new level, but it tosses Sandler’s carefully crafted on-screen image as a sweetly lovable goofball into the ocean. An Academy-award nomination for best actor is a possibility. If you saw “Good Time,” you’ll have an understanding of how the Safdies construct their movies. However, everything that made it powerful has been intensified and amplified to such a degree that “Uncut Gems” left audiences at the Telluride, Toronto, New York, and London film festivals shaken to the core. After seeing the movie, I wondered what the casting call was like. Did it read: Actors will work in cruel, garish lighting, with cinematographer Darius Khondji’s astonishing prowling camera inches from their faces. Dialogue will be spoken at a manic pace with the ability to ad-lib an asset. The more unusual you look, the better. It seemed as if, while going to the set, the Safdies drove by startlingly odd-looking faces, and, on the spot, offered people a chance to be an extra, or perhaps even say a line or two. Italian directorial maestro Federico Fellini, who relished unattractiveness, paved the way for Josh and Benny. The brothers should remake 1932’s “Freaks.” “Uncut Gems” is a great American crime thriller, and a brutal and riveting drama of desperation. The brothers directed as a team and co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bronstein, who co-edited with Benny. Composer Daniel Lopatin (known as Oneohtrix Point Never) delivers anger and edge with his music. A whirlwind Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a successful and well-liked wholesale jeweler working in the fast-paced world of money-for-gems in Manhattan’s diamond-trading district. Ratner also has a sports gambling problem, which opens the floodgates to delusional thinking and bad decisions. He’s always on the lookout for the next big score. Professional basketball is his temptress. In fact, in what can only be described as creating his own personal pyramid scheme, Ratner leverages a rare Ethiopian gemstone in order to bet on not only who wins a game, but also on the spread, how many times a player touches a ball, who wins jumps at center, and myriad other odd combinations as he flirts with certain financial doom. Gambling generates debt – it always will – and when Ratner can’t pay what he owes to nervous loan sharks, he tries to leverage the leverage, including attempting to finesse his friendship with an NBA professional, played by Kevin Garnett of the Boston Celtics. Clocks are ticking everywhere. On the basketball court. In his marriage (he’s cheating on his wife, superbly acted by Idina Menzel). And with the unforgiving thugs who’ve come to collect what they’re owed. The Safdie brothers surround Howard with adversaries. Ratner is the classic positive thinker in over his head. He’s too hyperactive to be afraid. Only a very clever fellow can escape. Is he clever enough? Or is he just one more foolish loser? His precious African opal seems to be a talisman of bad luck. Unless you can get away with cheating at an auction, you may not want to rely on shill bidders to aid and abet your rescue from wrong choices. Through it all, Sandler’s Ratner bobs and weaves and fast talks his way in and out of corners, until the rooms in which he lives, works, and plays are all metaphorically round. Trying to survive can get ugly. CATS: Reportedly, millions of people love the Olivier and Tony-award-winning stage musical “Cats.” The London production, which opened in 1981, ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway production, which opened a year later, ran for 18 years and 7,485 performances. “Cats” has been revived in London’s West End twice and on Broadway once. It has also been translated into multiple languages and performed around the world. The longest-running foreign productions include a 15-year run in Hamburg, Germany that played over 6,100 performances, as well as a still-ongoing run in Japan that began in 1983 and has played more than 10,000 performances. Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, who hasn’t met a previous musical from which he might not borrow a melody – he’s the pastiche king – based his show on poet T.S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book Of Practical Cats.” The song lyrics come from the poems. Supposedly, many millions of theatergoers genuinely hate “Cats.” I didn’t like the musical when I saw it on Broadway, because I thought it lacked a strong story, failed to be expansive on the overly crowded stage, and had only two memorable songs, the razzle-dazzle opener called ""Prologue: Jellicle Songs For Jellicle Cats"" and the haunting ""Memory."" Both are sung in the new film version. However, Betty Buckley as Grizabella, who sang “Memory” on Broadway when I saw it, was superb. My caveats about the stage musical are similar to what other naysayers have said or written. I wouldn’t know if everybody who loves the house cat as a pet, and has seen a production of “Cats,” adores Webber’s show. Regardless, rarely has a musical been so controversial. Webber’s vision is now, as they say, “a major motion picture.” “Cats” isn’t the dog a lot of folks think it is, or want it to be. Far too many social media mavens flew into a tizzy after the studio released the first preview on the internet. These instant judges committed a cultural crime by offering strident opinions on a movie they had not seen in its entirety. It was obvious to me that a lot of people had no idea what happens on stage during “Cats.” Singers and dancers, human beings just like the complainers, dress up like cats and, well, they sing and dance for a couple of hours. You know, like they do nightly on Broadway, or during national tours, or on high school stages. The truth of the matter is this: You simply need to suspend disbelief. Don't fight the visuals. Movies can be fantasies, and “Cats” is one heck of a fantasy. The film is better than the stage production because it’s more expansive. The action is opened up. What thin story there is involves Jellicle cats of every stripe being introduced to the audience as they all prepare for the big Jellicle Ball where one cat will be selected to ascend into the Heavyside Layer and live a wonderful new life. Believe me, I know why you’re laughing. Most of the story takes place in a tumble-down corner of London and is about an abandoned cat, Victoria, wonderfully played by ballerina Francesca Hayward, who is only looking to be part of a group that won’t hurt her any more than she’s already been hurt. She then meets the wisest of the wise, Old Deuteronomy (Dame Judi Dench); Gus The Theatre Cat (Sir Ian McKellen), the villainous McCavity (Idris Elba), the forlorn former legendary cat Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson), the catnip-loving Bombalurina (Taylor Swift), the strong and loyal Munkustrap (Robbie Fairchild), and Mr. Mistoffelees (Laurie Davidson), a cat who can do wonderful magic tricks. Yes, Rum Tum Tugger and Skimbleshanks are in the mix as well. There are a lot of cats trying to one-up each other. The original songs are heard, including the big opening Jellicle production number. The cast dazzles with its dancing, but director Tom Hopper, who co-wrote the screenplay with Lee Hall, hurts the musical by cutting into the energetic dance routines as if they were jigsaw puzzles. He needed to pay attention to those old MGM musicals to see that the camera was often held in a long shot during dance routines, which really are more enjoyable and emotional when filmed that way. There are weak links in the cat cast, especially Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and James Corden as Bustopher Jones, who play self-admitted “fat cats,” and not the corporate kind. Just because you think you can sing and dance, doesn’t mean you can. Obviously, Hooper decided to ignore their weaknesses. Grizabella’s song “Memory” is still a heartfelt, powerhouse number. Hudson’s singing is sensational, including during the moment when her voice literally breaks into a cry mid-lyric. Dench’s Old Deuteronomy, a male cat in the theater productions, but a female in the movie, invites understanding with a wonderful monologue about loving cats, treating them right, and living with their myriad idiosyncrasies. Anything else is a dog. Mistoffelees’ important scene with his magic playing cards and floating instruments is a visual delight. Was there a moment when “Cats” could have gone either way for me? Yes, and it happened early-on in the film. The Busby Berkeley-style dancing cockroaches and singing mice might have been a deal breaker. However, the sequence was just nutty enough to make me appreciate the whimsy. I saw scores of choreographer Berkeley’s vibrant synchronized dancing movies in college film classes and at movie retrospectives in New York City and Los Angeles, films like “Dames,” “Footlight Parade,” “42nd Street,” “Hollywood Hotel,” and the many “Gold Diggers Of…” extravaganzas. They had a zaniness that was appealing. “Cats” is equally zany. The cast gives it their all, even if, as noted, some of them don’t quite make it. The film isn’t high art, but it’s well-made and expands the restrictions of the stage in a way that gives the show some freshness. There are some genuine laughs. JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL: Successful sequels are always an iffy proposition, and most movie fans will tell you that “The Godfather 2” is the greatest sequel ever made. Therefore, the current follow-up to two earlier “Jumanji” films, mildly subtitled “The Next Level,” isn’t in the running for best sequel, but it is in the running for enjoyable entertainment frivolity. The first entry in the franchise was released in 1995. The little ones in your household, those who go to see movies, are assuredly held rapt by “Frozen II,” but what about older children and families that just want to have a good time together in a theater? This new “Jumanji” edition headlines Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan and the always sneaky scene-stealer (in a good way) Jack Black. It’s a fun quartet held together by director Jake Kasdan, who knows how to keep a slightly confusing story rolling. His screenwriters are Jeff Pinkner and Scott Rosenberg. In the previous film, “Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle” from 2017, four affable teenagers – Martha (Morgan Turner), her boyfriend Spencer (Alex Wolff), football star Fridge (Ser’Darius Blain) and pretty and popular Bethany (Madison Iseman) became part of a video game as adult avatars, with much of the focus on explorer and gym workout regular Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Johnson), wise-cracking professor Shelly Oberon (Black), eager commando Ruby Roundhouse (Gillan), and the proper zoologist Franklin “Moose” Finbar (Hart). This time around Kasdan and his team have kept all of the characters, but they occasionally scramble the avatars, which makes for some good laughs. Additionally, new avatars arrive on the scene, including Ming Fleetfoot, a thief played by the always wonderful Awkafina. There’s also a villain named Jurgen The Brutal (Rory McCann). The story involves getting lost in a video game, trying to get out of that video game, a magic necklace, a hungry python, angry ostriches, a glowing pool of water (bright green if you’re wondering), Jurgen’s thunderous yelling, and a lot of other bits of adventure and welcome silliness. Spencer wants to redeem himself for something that happened in the previous film. A delightful twosome has been added. Danny De Vito pops up as Spencer’s curmudgeonly grandfather Eddie, and Danny Glover is Eddie’s former business partner, the mellower Milo. Their interactions together are quite funny. What’s just as funny? Johnson and Hart imitating them. Is there a message being told with this madcap tomfoolery? Of course there is: Always look for the true person behind the mask they’re wearing. As with many comic adventures, keep your eye on an important jewel. “Jumanji” The Next Level” is a pleasant reason to get the family out of the house and into a movie theater.

This film is amazing, the logical and pure synthesis of the Safdie Brothers style, distilled to perfection. All the cast are incredible. Julia Fox, in her first role, is superb. Sandler is superb. All the grimy sleazoids, the nightclub homies, and the sports stars playing themselves are superb. Eric Bogosian is superb. And, once again, the Safdies have found all manner of non-actors and trusted them with big roles (such as Fox); all are superb. Besides being a thoroughly successful experiment in relentless suspense and tension, it represents amazing storytelling. Every character, no matter how minor, seethes with inner life (case in point: the nice guy in the casino; you’ll see what I mean when you meet him). The dialogue is original, vibrant, startling and unique. The milieu is beyond evocative and fuelled by integrity, the camerawork is energetic and artful, the score (typically for the Safdies) wondrous strange, and the pacing magnificent. One of 2019’s best. It will make you grateful you don’t want any of the things the people in the film want, unless you do, in which case it may just get you to re-evaluate your life.

Thanks for reading The Tyee today — we hope this article added to your day in some way. Our team of independent journalists takes pride in doing in-depth reporting and taking time to get it right.
 
We're able to focus our attention on publishing impactful journalism in the public interest, and publish it for free for all to read, because we have the support of Tyee Builders. Tyee Builders are readers who contribute a bit of money — at a level and frequency of their choice — to support our editorial budget.
 
This core of supporters — making up about 1 to 2 per cent of our daily readership — enables us to pay our writers, keep our articles free and open to all, and not bombard our readers with annoying ads while you try to read.
 
Instead of focusing on what kind of articles will attract the most advertising dollars, we can spend time devoted to researching and writing stories that our readers find most valuable and make the most positive impact in our region.
 
You made it all the way through the article – I hope that means you liked it (or if not ‘liked’ it, gleaned some useful information from it). Tyee articles are known for being quite lengthy, so we appreciate when people spend some quality time with our work.
 
Listen, I’ll get to the point – the article you just read was made possible because our non-profit newsroom was able to pay a talented journalist to research and write it. And we can only afford to do that because of our business model, which relies on a certain percentage of our readers signing up for our paid membership program called Tyee Builders.
 
The traditional business model for journalism in Canada has been completely disrupted, and we’re witnessing a slow collapse as corporate newsrooms buy up distressed publications, lay people off, and suck the value out of them before declaring bankruptcy. And it doesn’t help that tech giant Meta has blocked Canadian news on their Facebook and Instagram platforms.
 
Between 1 to 2 per cent of people who visit The Tyee contribute financially, but amazingly, that small percentage is enough to fund half of our overall budget. And it means we can operate without a paywall, too. 1 per cent of people giving means 99 per cent of people get access to quality, fact-based journalism from a talented team of journalists who live and work in B.C., Alberta, and across Canada. We think that’s pretty remarkable.
 So, here we are. The end of the year, the start of a new decade. At such a juncture it behooves one to look back, scratch one’s back fat and pontificate upon the passage of time.  It was an odd year in movies, reflecting the general upheaval on the planet — from political chaos to the environmental catastrophe to everyone needing to have a staunch opinion about The Irishman. I’m not exactly sure why this particular film caused otherwise reasonable people to lose their damn minds, but, as Manohla Dargis pointed out in the New York Times, it was the year of male crisis, with men of the species having ongoing freakouts about their relevance, importance and other penile stuff. The Lighthouse, Ford v Ferrari, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Joker, The Two Popes and even Mr. Rogers going full Daddy Dearest in A Beautiful Day in the Neighbourhood were enough to convince anyone with a working set of eyeballs that something was up with men. While women, both in movies and in real life, were trying to get on with things, a great many men craned their heads so far up their own asses they apparently got stuck up there. So, while men figure it out, let’s move on to other things. There were some terrible disappointments this year. I am pretty undemanding when it comes to Star Wars, but the latest iteration might convince you that J.J. Abrams forgot how to make movies. Overblown and underdeveloped all at the same time, The Rise of Skywalker actually achieved the feat of being deeply boring. Not since interplanetary trade disputes took over the plot of The Phantom Menace have I seen an audience so visibly wilt in a theatre. You could almost see the cloud of befuddlement gather over people’s heads as they tried (in vain) to make out the painful plot. Worse was the sense that all of the characters were strange imitations of themselves, like Invasion of the Body Snatchers had somehow jumped the space shark and taken over Kylo Ren and Rey. Perhaps in another 10 years we will be ready for the next installment in the Star Wars universe, but more likely we’ll have other concerns, like growing gills and learning how to swim as the waters rise here on planet Earth. While every critic has gone claws out for Cats or had a he said/she said moment in Marriage Story, there were lots of other films this year that deserved some time and attention. Sometimes one moment was enough for a film to endear itself. Dakota Johnson merrily giving Shia LaBeouf the finger in The Peanut Butter Falcon, a film remarkable mostly for the amount of time no one wears a shirt. Or LaBeouf playing his own evil clown of a father in Honey Boy. Again, daddy issues were big this year. Despite being largely left off the awards ballots, women filmmakers offered up some of the best films on offer, including Jennifer Kent’s The Nightingale, Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir, Greta Gerwig’s Little Women, Lorene Scafaria’s Hustlers, Olivia Wilde’s Booksmart, Lulu Wang’s The Farewell, Céline Sciamma’s Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Claire Denis’s High Life and, of course, the late great Agnès Varda’s Agnès on Varda. A great many of these films are screening in Vancouver’s Vancity Theatre as part of its Best of 2019 Series. Over at the Cinematheque, curators Shaun Inouye and Jim Sinclair have expanded the scope, offering their favourite films from the decade. It is a delectable cornucopia of cinema, and the temptation to gorge shouldn’t be resisted but wildly indulged. Anyone who lived through the 1980s and the bad relationships therein might watch this film between their fingers. It is beautiful and painful in equal measures, a doomed love story meted out in series of exquisitely calibrated scenes. Newcomer Honor Swinton Byrne (the daughter of acting royalty Tilda Swinton) plays Julie, a young woman of great privilege and terrible fragility. There is specificity to the time, place and era of the film, based on director Joanna Hogg’s own experience, but there is also remarkable universality. It reminded me, with almost agonizing detail, what first love with an older (complicated) man can do to a young soul. It’s a truly staggering achievement that walks the razor edge of grief and love with the precision of an aerialist. This is a film that reminds one that Adam Sandler can actually act. So why hasn’t he been doing this kind of stuff for the past 20 years? Beats the hell out of me. The film is filled to the brim with real New York characters — could anyone actually make up someone like Wayne Diamond? — and the Safdie Brothers have crafted a corrosive love song to the hustlers, grifters and rancid mad risk takers who made America great. Also, it’s just nice to see Eric Bogosian back on the big screen again. Petra Costa made an extraordinary documentary about her sister’s death a few years ago. In her latest film she looks at the death of democracy in Brazil. Costa has a painterly way with film, and in dealing with her homeland’s history, turmoil and tragedy she is working on an epic scale. At the same time, the film is burnished with smaller intimate details of family, parents, grandparents and children caught up in the grinding engines of history. I know I’ve yammered on about this film, but it felt decidedly new, from the pair of friends at the centre of the story to the celebration of female intelligence, ambition and loyalty. Gender-neutral bathrooms, sexual fluidity and all-round bonhomie mixed with good old-fashioned teenage horniness — what’s not to love?  Lovely, elegiac and a wee bit house porny, director Joe Talbot’s study of friendship felt like a story suspended in time, like something caught in a bubble of amber. The Fillmore District of San Francisco provides the setting and the impetus for a tale of two friends — Jimmie (Jimmie Fails) and his friend Mont (Jonathan Majors), both searching for a sense of home and meaning. Based on screenwriter Fails’ experience of growing up in the city on the bay, The Last Black Man in San Francisco possessed a rare quality of being deeply authentic and idiosyncratic at the same time. I haven’t seen anything quite like it. A lot of critics did not much care for director Taika Waititi’s comedic take on the Second World War, Nazis and an imaginary friend named Hitler, but I actually kind of liked this film and its peculiar mixture of sadness and sweetness. Also, its bevy of ’40s style hats perched atop the apex of Scarlett Johansson’s head. Yes, it’s silly and occasionally questionable in taste (oh those hilarious Nazis!) but despite a few misfires, the film had an amiable way about it that wormed its way into my affections. Just as I was tempted to throw my hands in the air over the miserable state of Canadian narrative cinema, along came Elle-Máijá Tailfeathers and Kathleen Hepburn’s stunning feature. Shot in Vancouver and co-starring Tailfeathers and newcomer Violet Nelson, the film did something miraculous, capturing not only the atmosphere and air of the city itself but also the ineffable, often silent mysteries of female experience and communion.  If I had to pick a film, other than Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite, that summed up the previous year it would be Terrence Malick’s A Hidden Life. Malick, like a lot of other filmmakers of a certain age and inclination, can be insanely self-indulgent, and a great many of his tics and schtick are on full display in this new film. But at its core is a diamond-hard chunk of truth about how difficult it can be to do the right thing. The story is based on the life of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian conscientious objector who was killed when he refused to swear a loyalty oath to Hitler. Franz (August Diehl), his wife Fani (Valerie Pachner) and their three small children live a simple life as farmers in a small rural village. They cut hay, milk cows and plant potatoes; it’s so bucolic it’s practically beatific. But the drumbeats of terrible happenings, embodied by the thudding roar of Messerschmitt fighter planes, herald change. Watching the film, with its swirling dappled beauty akin to sunlight caught and fractured in swaying trees, leaving coronas of colour caught behind your eyes, it’s hard not to simply be overwhelmed by the pure visual splendour. There is something of the ecstatic in the dance of changing seasons, the cleft of mountains and valleys coming together, the arc of the sky carved against the earth, the physical joy of love, all of it cast against the looming shadow of despair and suffering. Although Malick lets loose with many of his usual flourishes, for pure untrammelled loveliness the film is hard to beat.  But a few scenes of brutal honesty anchor its lushness. In the middle of the film, Franz visits a church and talks to a painter. It’s a short scene, but it sums up a great deal of the things that we’re faced with at the moment — hypocrisy, cowardice, corruption, all embedded in the art we make and the politics we fight over. Says the painter, while touching up an image of Christ painted on the church ceiling: “They look up and imagine that if they’d lived back in his time, they wouldn’t have done what the others did. They would’ve stood by him. They wouldn’t have run. His friends did, though. They would, too.” It isn’t simply maintaining your moral position in the face of people who hurt and abuse you. But the film’s profound and almost unbearable emotional weight comes from its look at the challenge of resisting the entreaties of the people who love you the most.  A Hidden Life is a story for the ages, best summed up by the quote from George Eliot’s Middlemarch that provides its title: “The growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts; and that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.” On the eve of a new decade it’s tempting to think that after 10 years we humans might’ve solved a few problems. In fact, some things did get better, and then intractable issues crowded into the empty space left behind. Sometimes it feels like maintaining hope is a bit foolish. In this films can help, offering small pleasures, a scene here, a snatch of atmosphere there, and the opportunity to live in another life for a while. This can be a great blessing. Movies have buoyed me through a number of dark patches. A SAD lamp for the soul, cinematic chicken soup, whatever you would like to call it. So here’s to the coming year and a new decade. Let’s try to be good to each other, and to our sad old beautiful world.

"Dec 27, 2019"," Uncut Gems, the new movie from brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, is kind of like that. Because on a theme park thrill ride, you deep down understand that you're safe, that you're only tricking your lizard brain into believing you're in danger by the pulling of g's and the stop-and-start whiplash hurtling around hairpins. On a theme park thrill ride, you see the guardrails, you're aware of the apparatus. Keep your limbs inside the cart at all times and you can probably walk away when it clicks to a stop. You know this, even if your body doesn't. That's pretty much the same trick the brothers pull off here. You know that's really Adam Sandler, not some scuzzy degenerate gambler being threatened on screen. You know they're not really going to hurt him. But knowing and feeling are different things, and watching Uncut Gems is like being dragged by your lapels through a black-lit mirrored funhouse populated by hard men with murderous eyes while fireworks scream and bang, and a wheedling goblin with the voice of Gilbert Gottfried rides your back. Sound like fun? Anyway, Uncut Gems begins in the opal mines of northern Ethiopia, where an especially colorful example is being pulled from the ground, before audaciously cutting to colonoscope footage displayed on a hospital monitor. And yes, the opals have gotten deep inside this patient, Howard Ratner (Sandler), a Jewish jeweler operating out of Manhattan's diamond district. Howard has spent 17 months working to acquire (smuggle in) the ragged, raw opal, from which he expects to realize a $1 million profit. And Howard needs a big score -- his gambling debts are such that he's being shadowed by goons. He's making increasingly reckless bets, hoping to get clear. His creditors are worried and given to violence. When he gets back to his shop, the Boston Celtics' all-star center Kevin Garnett (playing himself) is waiting, browsing his shop for bling. Garnett and his entourage have been steered to Howard's shop by Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who specializes in procuring the business of wealthy black athletes and entertainers. (One of Howard's signature items is a gold and diamond-encrusted Furby that comes with a necklace chain.) Howard, a basketball fan, is so excited about his new opal, he has to show it to Garnett -- and for a moment we think that he might be trying to hustle the player, as he goes on about the reputed magical powers of the stone. But when Garnett tries to buy it, Howard refuses, saying he's already consigned it for auction. It's not for sale. So why did you show it to me? Garnett asks. He's taken with it, he's all caught up in the folklore. He feels a connection with the uncut opal. He wants to borrow it. He's playing a game back home in Boston tonight, game 1 of the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Philadelphia 76ers. Howard reluctantly agrees to let Garnett borrow the stone overnight (the first of a series of bad decisions) but not before taking the player's 2008 World Championship ring as collateral. And as soon as Garnett and his crew are out the door, Howard runs out to pawn the ring to raise funds for a bet on Garnett and the Celtics to win the opening game of the series. But Howard isn't just betting on the Celtics, he's combining it with various prop bets on Garnett's performance -- a six-way parlay, which depends not only on the Celtics winning the game, but leading at half-time and Garnett going over on his projected totals for points, rebounds and blocked shots. Oh, and the Celtics also have to win the opening tip. Howard's bookie Gary (played by New York sports talk host Mike Francesa) describes this bet as the dumbest he's ever seen. ""I disagree. I disagree, Gary,"" Howard lilts on his way out the door. He thinks he knows that Garnett believes in the power of the opal. Howard is playing a hunch and getting 15 to 1 odds. But if he loses on any component of the bet, he loses. Somehow the bet comes through. Howard wins -- but his loan shark brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian), to whom Howard owes a six-figure sum, got wind of the irresponsible bet and cancelled it. He doesn't like Howard making wild bets while he still owes him money. He doesn't like that Howard resurfaced his swimming pool either. And he probably doesn't like how Howard treats Dinah (Idina Menzel), his wife and Arno's sister, who's just waiting until after Passover to file for divorce. Howard's got a mistress (Julia Fox) stashed in his midtown apartment. Howard's in more trouble now. He needs to get his opal back from Garnett, and Garnett's championship ring back to him. He needs to be there for his daughter's school play. He needs to avoid Arno and his muscle. He needs to feed his addiction to action. Maybe even more than with their breakout 2017 film Good Time, the Safdies throw the audience into the midst of this cacophonous confusion, as the constantly running Howard churns through this dazzling chaos, raising funds and making bad decisions. Sandler, who has proved his worth as a dramatic actor before (Punch-Drunk Love being the prime exhibit), has never been better, or funnier, than he is here. His Howard is forever falling, flailing and failing -- nothing he does ever turns out right, he whines at one point -- but he's determined to stay in the game. The film revolves around the facts of the actual basketball games, and the Safdies, working with longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein, have crafted an intricate scenario that relies on the clockwork precision of the performers, who often seem to be riffing in real time. It's a remarkably well-cast movie, and the decision to use charismatic Garnett turns out to be more than just stunt casting. Venerable performers Bogosian, Menzel and Judd Hirsch add ballast, while newcomers like Fox, Keith Williams Richards and Jonathan Aranbayev (playing , respectively, Arno's chief thug and Howard's 15-year-old son) click seamlessly into place. (One might find the casting of exuberant former dress designer turned megamillionaire Wayne Diamond as a slightly outsized version of himself a stretch too far.) It says something about the cultural moment the Safdies are enjoying that Tilda Swinton and Natasha Lyonne lent their voices to the production. There's a loopy momentum to the way Howard -- and maybe Sandler too -- improvises, finding just the right lies to tell to buy another few seconds in which he might come up with something better. R&B singer The Weeknd plays himself — and has a fight scene — in the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems, a seedy crime movie about a gambler trying to outrun his demons.

"Dec 27, 2019"," Meet Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a fast-talking NYC jeweler with a frustrating inability to accept what he damn well already has. He gambles with everything for any kind of trade-up: his marriage to wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), the affections of his employee/mistress Julia (Julia Fox), and even the attention of his three children he rarely sees. Forever juggling markers being called in from small-time fences, big-time bookies, and various loan sharks, his biggest opportunity arrives in the form of a fist-sized opal smuggled out of Ethiopia, and nothing seems capable of removing Howard’s blinders while dreaming of his elusive million-dollar payday. The film about long-shots is a long-shot itself, earning whispers of the name “Adam Sandler” in conjunction with the phrase “Best Actor.” Directors Josh and Benny Safdie’s film about hustlers and criminals fighting over the same scraps has the intimate feel, Indie chops, and Hollywood pedigree to pull the kind of upset industry types tune in to awards shows to see. What may be the biggest surprise is the film getting attention outside of the industry with a Christmas release and moviegoers showing interest. What’s going on here that’s generating so much buzz?

As the Fred Flintstone of the Diamond District, Sandler’s Howard manages to fail upward with just enough charisma to tread water. There’s no question the threat of drowning is ever-present, always one angry thug away from certain destruction he uses street-smarts to escape from. Aware and informed of the system stacked against him, it’s masterful watching him leverage friend, foe, and family relationships, but this is far from a family film. Like watching a worm wriggling on a hook for two hours while hungry fish snap at it, it’s an endurance test foreshadowing the final five minutes of the film; while observant viewers won’t be too surprised by the plot, they might be by the performance. More a game of Stratego than a chess match, it wouldn’t be fair to call this “Tarantino light,” but it incorporates similar setups without parading them around as “a film.” Sandler manages to appear serious enough to worry about even when looking a bit silly; it isn’t entirely clear if he cries badly or just angles for sympathy, but the latter would be in character. The real surprise after Sandler is Julia Fox, the mistress who seems street savvy and smitten at the same time; is she on the level or one more person working an angle? The genius herein is all the ways viewers might feel about the ending… and none of them wrong.

"Dec 27, 2019"," Every once in a while—and it isn’t very often, I assure you—I ask a very simple favor of anyone who takes the time to read what I have to write on a regular basis. And that one favor is to trust me. You may have written off Adam Sandler ages ago, and the idea of watching him as a shifty, fast-talking, slightly manic, New York City jeweler to the stars may not appeal to you on the surface. But I’m telling you, there is truly nothing quite as weirdly intoxicating or stress-inducing (meant in the best possible way) as watching Sandler as Howard Ratner in Uncut Gems, as he navigates the pure, uncut chaos that is his personal and professional life in the hopes of coming out on top as a businessman, a gambler, a lover, and even a father. From two of the most daring filmmakers working today, Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie (Good Time, Heaven Knows What), Uncut Gems follows the quirky yet charismatic Howard through the course of only a couple of days in his life. The story is set just a few years in the past, but it is very much rooted in the real world, as Howard moves through his cramped store where he seems to specialize in some fairly tacky pieces (including a jewel-encrusted Furby). He also carries a few high-end watches that make their way into his shop via local wheeler-dealer Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who one day brings in the Boston Celtics player Kevin Garnett (the film is set just recently enough in the past that Garnett, playing himself, is still an active player; he retired in 2016), who is not only looking for some jewelry but maybe a little inspiration. Howard has just acquired (through some fairly shady channels) a rare uncut gemstone that Garnett lays eyes on and asks if he can hold onto it for a day, which Howard reluctantly agrees to if Garnett will leave his championship ring as collateral. In case I didn’t mention it, Howard is a degenerate gambler, so he immediately pawns Garnett’s ring for cash that he can gamble on that night’s Celtics game. Not surprisingly Howard owes a lot of bookies and loan sharks money, including one named Arno (Eric Bogosian), who is particularly nasty, but can’t quite take it out on Howard as much as he’d like because he’s also his brother-in-law. (Arno is married to Howard’s wife's sister; Howard's wife is Dinah, played by Idina Menzel.) The other major figure in Howard’s ridiculous life is his mistress and store employee Julia (newcomer and famed New York party girl, fashion designer, and artist Julia Fox), who is a master manipulator but also seems to truly love Howard. This doesn’t keep her from ending up in a club bathroom at one point in the film, snorting coke (and maybe a little bit more) with singer The Weeknd. As the film goes on, Howard is betting, Garnett is winning, Arno is attempting to collect, Julia is seducing, and Demany is attempting to retrieve the uncut piece from Garnett to give back to Howard, but Garnett is hesitant to let it go. Each piece of Howard’s life either sets up or derails all of the other pieces, and watching him move from person to person and location to location results in an almost unbearable tension throughout the film that is also its lifeblood. To say that Sandler has never been better doesn’t quite explain what he’s accomplished in Uncut Gems. He is an unstoppable source of energy, and as the pressure builds in Howard’s life, he seems to rise to the occasion, takes on every adversary, and even finds ways to stand up to his possibly cheating girlfriend and his hateful (for good reason) wife. We’ve seen Sandler rise to the material in films like Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch Drunk Love and Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories, but what he’s achieved here is entirely unique and impossible not to watch. Uncut Gems in a cinematic pressure cooker about a guy who can’t help but make all the wrong decisions because somewhere in their midst is a play that leads to that elusive big score. The last 20 minutes of the film are extraordinary in terms of editing, pacing and performance, bringing several of the leads into a layered sequence that is both triumphant and tragic. The movie marks a new level for Sandler and the other players in the film, but it also marks new highs for the Safdies, whose whirlwind shooting process and skillful use of both seasoned and first-time actors results in some of the most authentic scenarios in any movie this year. So trust me on this one, and you will undoubtedly be floored by this panic attack on film. Steve Prokopy is chief film critic for the Chicago-based arts outlet

"Dec 27, 2019"," The problem with Sandler's career is there has been so many films where it seems like he is just coasting by that we sometimes forget how good he can be. His talent is on full display in ""Uncut Gems"" - a tense, high-wire act from from Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie that is a ball of intense chaotic energy. The chaos is needed to capture Sandler's rather chaotic character - Howard Ratner, a New York City jeweler who always seems to be on the edge of having his entire world collapse. Howard is barely able to stay one step ahead of his bookies. His home life is also a mess, with Howard estranged from his wife (Idina Menzel), living with a younger woman (Julia Fox) and barely there as a dad for his children. After a chance meeting with NBA superstar Kevin Garnett, Howard comes up with a plan that he thinks will fix everything - wagering his future on a recent acquisition that he plans on using to help finance a series of debts that will finally get him out of the red for good. Like their previous film ""Good Time"" the Safdie brothers have taken a rather unlikable character and putting him on a roller coaster that the audience is allowed to experience firsthand. The tension is there from the opening scene and doesn't let up throughout the film's 135 minute run time, with the Safdies constantly bombarding the audience with the same kind of frenzy that Howard is experiencing it. None of this would work if Sandler wasn't up to the challenge. He shows he is more than capable of engulfing this character, in a performance that rivals some of his best work (a scene with Garnett where he explains why he gambles is as good as any individual scene in any film this year). He clearly takes the chance here, rewarding the audience with an uneasy character study that is definitely one of the cinematic gems of the holiday season.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019"," ** Five months after the thrillingly daft Cats trailer set the internet aflame, giving critics the opportunity to invent new ways to skin a doomed blockbuster, the CGI-enhanced, live-action rendering of modern Broadway's spectacle arrives as just another mediocrity. Nobody among the A-list clowder (Taylor Swift, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo) embarrasses themselves, and a few bewhiskered stars claw their way toward respectability. Idris Elba lends a sly carnality to mystical antagonist Macavity, Ian McKellen blesses Gus the Theatre Cat with a louche twinkle, and Jennifer Hudson's feral diva Grizabella is transcendent during her ""Memory"" showstopper. Beyond a few standout performances, the film languishes as a patently inoffensive, drearily pedestrian take on a still-bonkers mega-musical based on a collection of poems T.S. Eliot wrote for his godchildren. In what is little more than an extended introduction of our fanciful felines tied together with a wisp of narrative concerning the rebirth awarded to one lucky kitty during their annual ball, director Tom Hooper (Les Misérables) barely adapts the source material yet steadily erodes the play's choreography. The ADD flurry of glamour close-ups shoved into weaponized burlesque atop perspective-damage sets feels uncomfortably K-pop, while poorly framed shots best resemble a commercial for some local production. For all of the star power on display, this is an indoor Cats: spayed, defanged and thoroughly domesticated. PG. JAY HORTON.

To say Louisa May Alcott's iconic 1868 novel Little Women has been well-trodden by Hollywood over the decades would be an understatement. The story has been told seven times on film, including two silent versions, so when Greta Gerwig announced her follow-up to the fantastic Lady Bird would be yet another adaptation, more than a few of her fans felt underwhelmed. Any apprehension is, thankfully, unnecessary. Gerwig has called Little Women's protagonist, Jo (Saoirse Ronan), her ""North Star,"" and the director's deft touch breathes exciting new life into familiar material—Gerwig rearranges the chronology of the story, for instance—while retaining a reverence for characters that have been beloved for well over a century. The dream cast carries its weight throughout, as well. Emma Watson, Eliza Scanlen and Florence Pugh (as Meg, Beth and Amy, respectively) all bring depth to the rest of the March sisters. Beyond the strength of the performances of the little women, Meryl Streep (hilarious), Chris Cooper (haunted, haunting) and Timothée Chalamet (exuberant, charmingly aimless) each steal scenes in very different, but crucial, ways. Sweet without being saccharine, Gerwig's Little Women, is, simply put, a lovely experience. It's also one that propels Gerwig to the fore of any discussion of modern cinema's best young directors.

Some films are described as ""white-knuckle."" Uncut Gems is plenty tense, all right, but it's much whiter around the nostrils. It's not a drug movie, per se, but everything in writer-directors the Safdie brothers' economic tragicomedy, from the overlapping dialogue to the whiplash pacing, is adrenalized by a jittery energy typically found in a nightclub restroom stall, and your enjoyment will largely depend on whether spending two hours in that sort of environment sounds exhilarating or simply exhausting. Also, how do you feel about Adam Sandler? He stars as a New York jeweler with severe risk addiction who's already deep in several dangerous debts when the movie starts, and adds a few more as it goes on. Sandler does career-best work here, mostly because he doesn't play down his comedic tendencies as he often does in dramatic roles but instead rolls them into a character who's every bit the obnoxious man-child he's used to playing, only freighted by insecurity he disguises behind a con man's perpetual grin. It's a terrific performance in a movie often too noisy for its own good. Critics have praised Uncut Gems as a feature-length panic attack, and indeed, the Safdies' great strength is getting the audience to tie their stomachs into knots over a guy who's not really worth rooting for. But once it reaches its climax—a blunt-force ending that's at once obvious and unsatisfying—you wonder why you'd ever willingly put yourself through that kind of trauma. R. MATTHEW SINGER.

"Dec 26, 2019"," This is an exhausting film about an idiotic man always looking for the next big score and falling short, leaving him screaming at people and people screaming at him. That ranges from the people he owes money to or has cheated out of money to his employees who are sick of having to deal with his dumb schemes. This is a great disappointment considering that it comes from the indie writer-director team of brothers, Benny and Josh Safdie, whose last film confirmed the dramatic chops of Robert Pattinson and made my top-10 list for 2017. “Good Time” was a great film about a bad night, one of extreme desperation for Pattinson’s character, as a robbery goes wrong, and then an escape goes bad, and then a different kind of heist is flubbed up in an even more ridiculous manner. While that film with an original voice was about one harrowing night of unusual experiences, “Uncut Gems” shows us one week in the life of a dope, and every day is the same, and it feels like an extension of the “Good Time” structure, so there’s nothing fresh. Howard Ratner (Sandler) is a high-end Jewish jeweler in the “diamond district” of New York City who works to make big sales to rich clients when he’s not spreading money around a series of bookies to bet on NBA games. The film opens in Ethiopia, where poor miners find a gigantic opal, and somehow, Howard gets his hands on it in 2012 (the setting of the movie) and finds he has a client interested in what he thinks are the stone’s magical properties. The trouble is that Howard is trying to make this deal happen while also holding his loan-shark brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian) and his toughs at bay, and while also attempting to satisfy his frustrated client-finder who brought Garnett to him, played by the always-good LaKeith Stanfield. Complicating all of this is Howard trying to keep his home life in order while also putting up his girlfriend/shop employee (artist/newcomer actress Julia Fox, the best thing in the film) in a Manhattan apartment. I couldn’t help but think that as a wheeler-dealer type, the Safdie brothers might see Howard as a charismatic figure, but if that’s the case, why does everyone want to kill this obscene, petty clown? It’s because he’s a completely unlikable character who sees life as not worth living without some element of risk, so he brings all of his troubles upon himself, and my sympathy for him is zero. There are characters in films you may not like or respect, but if you look deeper, you see they are doing certain acts purely out of a survival instinct. But Howard has a gorgeous wife (Idina Menzel) who seems lovely, and she has many friends, and the couple has two children who appear to be intelligent and talented. Howard seems to understand his business and have a good life in his control, but he doesn’t want it because he is, as he would say, a schmuck.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 26, 2019"," That's right, resist the temptation to see the feel-good film and take a risk on the feel-bad one (and I use that term in the most complimentary way). The press materials for ""Uncut Gems"" describe Adam Sandler’s compulsive gambler Howard Ratner as “charismatic.” Perhaps, but it’s a charisma that has burned itself out and Howard is now coasting on fumes.  He has a gorgeous, smart wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) but he also has a love pad set up for his girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) who also works at his jewelry store in New York's Diamond District. Howard wants to be a player, a winner, someone who others look to as important. He thinks he has finally hit upon the score that is going to change his life. He has managed to get his hands on an uncut opal from an Ethiopian Jewish mining company. He has been told it's valued at over $1 million and he plans to auction it off. But, before he brings it to the auction house, he has to brag about his find to basketball star Kevin Garnett (playing himself and it doesn't hurt that his name also calls to mind a gemstone) who comes into his shop. Garnett wants to borrow the gem as a good luck charm for his game and here's where things start to take an accelerated downward spiral for Howard as he makes one bad decision after another.  The film's only flaw is that I can't figure out how Howard got to such a high point to fall down from. Compulsive gambling tends to be a lifelong problem, so why didn't he hit bottom sooner? Howard also has a total lack of morality in the sense that he writes the rules as he goes along depending on his needs. So if Garnett gives him the NBA championship ring as collateral for the uncut gem, Howard has no problem pawning it.  At one point, as his marriage is shattering into pieces around him, he asks his wife for one more chance, ever though she knows he's got gambling debts and a mistress on the side. This is the point where I wondered if the film would relent and not take Howard's story to its logical extreme. But it doesn't pull any punches. Dinah replies to his plea by telling him, ""I think you are the most annoying person I ever met… and if I had my way I would never see you again."" Directed by Josh and Benny Safdie (they made ""Good Time"" in 2017), the film excels at making you feel uncomfortable and I hesitate to even call it entertainment but they execute the film with such a meticulous and rapturous sense of escalating crisis that it’s like a car crash you drive by and can’t look away from. Daniel Lopatin's score and Darius Khondji's cinematography (enhanced by colorist Damien van der Cruyssen) intensity the film's driving pace that is moving relentlessly toward Howard's ultimate crash and burn. Despite the dark tones of the story, the film has some gorgeous cinematic moments whether its a visual journey into the splendors of the uncut gem or the magic of a school play as Howard's daughter acts in a play about greed that falls on the deaf ears of her father. The film moves like a single precision machine with every elements just pushing us forward in Howard's story. It may help that not only do Josh and Benny write and direct together but Benny edits the film. Directors who also edit (Robert Rodriguez, the Coens, Akira Kurosawa) seem to have an advantage in keeping the vision of their films sharply focused. I don't want to give away some of the film's best moments because the Safdies ramp up the film with such brutal exactitude that I don't want viewers waiting for a scene or moment. But the Safdies have a knack for showing us extreme characters and setting up scenes that beautifully reveal who those people are. Sandler excels as Howard. He seems able to alternate between dumb comedies (""You Don't Mess with the Zohan,"" ""Click,"" ""Jack and Jill"") and smart indie fare (""The Meyerowitz Stories,"" ""Punch Drunk Love""). Although the dumb films heavily outweigh the smart ones. As Howard, Sandler uses his own likability to provide a hint as to how Howard might have gotten to where he's at. Sandler's performance is restless and always moving, like a shark who can't simply stop for a moment and think about what he's doing. Menzel and Fox are also outstanding, giving some depth to characters that are on the periphery of Howard's life. ""Uncut Gems"" is definitely not for everyone but if you want a scathing antidote to holiday cheer then this is it. When I left the theater I felt like I could never sit through the film again because it did such a good job of showing us such an aggressively aggravating character. But it's a film I can't help thinking about so now I'm itching to see it again and willing to put myself through this exquisitely well-crafted ringer one more time.",POSITIVE

"Dec 26, 2019"," Sometimes, it’s really fun to be the guy saying that the Christmas movie riding a wave of positive buzz is terrible. Uncut Gems is not one of those times. It would be if I thought this unrelenting thriller was a bad movie, but it isn’t. On the contrary, it’s remarkable in many ways, and yet undoubtedly it got on my nerves. The story is set in the spring of 2012. Adam Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a jeweller who owns a shop in New York’s Diamond District. His store is on a second floor behind a nondescript wooden door, but that’s about the only thing inconspicuous about the reflective sunglasses-wearing Howard, whose Twitter handle is @howiebling. Shady methods have brought a rare uncut black opal into his possession, which he has valued at a minimum of $800,000. Who would be rich enough to buy such a stone? NBA superstar Kevin “KG” Garnett (who portrays himself — brilliantly, it should be said), who takes the rock out on loan and proceeds to have a big game in the playoffs, cementing his belief that the stone possesses good mojo for him. A prologue set in Ethiopia shows a miner mangling his leg after finding the black opal, which would seem to imply that the gem is cursed, except that the gambling-addicted Howard doesn’t appear to need any help destroying himself. He is a lowlife of a specifically Jewish sort — his fellow Jews would probably call him a schnorrer — but I dare say that many people from other minority communities know someone of his type: a guy constantly on the make, without an off switch, who doesn’t know how to play it cool or dress for a formal gala, the sort of operator whom classier immigrants with college degrees and such are supposed to be ashamed of. Howard’s wife (Idina Menzel) openly detests him, partly because he’s having an affair with a sales clerk named Julia (Julia Fox), and is planning to leave him after Passover. Garnett leaves his NBA championship ring with Howard as collateral for the opal, and Howard immediately turns around and pawns the ring for cash to bet on KG’s Boston Celtics. Even though that bet hits, he is constantly in debt, because he makes all these schemes and never considers the possibility that they might fail. This is the work of the brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, and if you’ve seen either of their previous films, Heaven Knows What and Good Time, you know that this is what they do: stories of desperate New Yorkers running pell-mell over town with life and death as their stakes. The Safdies know the Diamond District because their father worked there, and they lay out this famously scruffy block amid the glitz of midtown Manhattan with great specificity. Other filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet have captured the amount of chaos that one person can experience and cause other people in New York, and the Safdies are in that exalted class. Just watch the scene in which a group of pissed-off loan sharks come to Howard’s store to call in his debt. The buzzer-operated security door malfunctions and refuses to open, even though Howard is anxious to let them in, so he and his staffers work feverishly to open the door while the debt collectors stand there growing even more furious. The tension built up in this scene and in other places is harrowing stuff. Other people have a void at their center, but Howard is the void, and therein lies the problem. His insatiable need for more money (whether through his professional dealings or his sports bets) is all there is to him. Perhaps we don’t need some pat psychological backstory to explain what made him this way, but the script doesn’t give us any other dimensions to him at all. His wife tells him that he’s the most annoying person she’s ever met, and while we can understand how other characters might share in this view, we don’t get any hint of charm to explain what might have attracted her or Julia to him in the first place. He holds his family in little regard, barking out orders to his three kids rather than demonstrating much affection for them. He’s possessive, too, starting a fistfight with The Weeknd (who also portrays himself) when Julia starts cozying up to the singer at a concert. This is a man who needs to own things rather than love them, and the Safdies’ relentless focus on him yields no further insight. The character grows wearying along with the film. Sandler shares in the blame for this, too. Having played so many boring suburban dads in his middle age, this actor does disappear into the sleazy Howard. He is breathtakingly good in stretches of this film, as in one late scene in his office when Howard comes apart after all his schemes have gone south, as well as another one when he negotiates with KG to buy the stone and manipulates the athlete into paying a favorable price for it. Yet Sandler misses opportunities to bring shadings that the character badly needs. His performance here reminds me of his impression of Eric Bogosian from his Saturday Night Live days. (Bogosian, ironically, shows up here as Howard’s mobbed-up brother-in-law.) So Uncut Gems misses the mark despite all the things it does right. It’s a movie that I recommend that you see, even though I don’t like it very much. The Safdies are talented enough that I’m confident they’ll make better films. I hope we can say the same for Sandler, who was robbed of an Oscar nomination for Punch-Drunk Love and played an intellectual without visible strain in The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected). He deserves a better dramatic showcase than this flawed specimen. Interesting review. So it seems your dissatisfaction boils down to Sandler’s character is too one-note, there’s no complexity or ambivalence (no positives, just a relentless single negative)?",POSITIVE

"Dec 26, 2019"," Funnyman Adam Sandler undergoes a remarkable transformation in  “Uncut Gems.”  He’s really, really effective as a Diamond District hustler whose debts and sins are rapidly closing in on him. That said, the latest from the writing/directing Safdie Brothers (Benny and Josh) is like having an irate New Yawk cabbie screaming nonstop in your ear for two-plus hours. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, the middle-aged proprietor of a Manhattan jewelry store.  He calls himself a jeweler but he’s not so much an expert in gemology as he is a full-time con artist, always looking for his next (not necessarily legal) kill. Howard is an inveterate gambler who always is nurturing a get-rich-quick scheme.  He’s got a furious wife (Idina Menzel) and kids in the ‘burbs,  a girl squeeze (Julia Fox) he keeps in an apartment in the city, and a crushing gambling debt that finds him being stalked by a pair of underworld enforcers  (Tommy Dominik, Keith William Richards). Howard’s sure that his latest scheme will turn everything around. He has somehow gotten his hands on a “black opal,” a fist-sized gem smuggled out of Africa.  He’s already arranged to have this spectacular rock sold by a prestigious auction house; surely it will leave him set for life. Or at least alive. Or maybe not.  His streetsmart associate Demany (LaKeith Stansfield) introduces Howard to basketball star Kevin Garnett (playing himself, and most convincingly), who so loves the big opal that he asks to carry it around with him for a few days. He comes to regard it as his good luck charm. Everything that can go wrong — the b-baller won’t give up the gem, the auction house appraises it at a fraction of what Howard believes it is worth — does go wrong.  Howard races around from one disaster to the next, attempting to put out the fires that are eating away at his life, swearing nonstop, cajoling, lying, trying to hide his growing panic. Some of the situations he gets into are comic — a loan shark (Eric Bogosian) kidnaps Howard from a school play, strips him naked and locks him in the trunk of the family car — but as “Uncut Gems” progresses and our protagonist makes a desperate bet on a sporting event with money he doesn’t have, we can feel the noose tightening. But here’s the thing (and this may be Midwest prejudice leaching through)…”Uncut Gems” is exhausting rather than exhilarating. The dialogue is exchanged at drill sergeant volume, most of the characters are loathsome  and at more than two hours the film will, for many, wear out its welcome long before it comes to an end. Still, you’ve got to give the Safdies credit for looking at Sandler’s long-time obno-kid screen persona and extrapolating how that might mutate into a burned-out, hopeless maturity.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 26, 2019","The performances are good, everything felt authentic.",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019"," His name is Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), and he deals in jewels, watches, gems — all that glitters is gold to him. Back in the day, Howard sold oversized jewelry to rappers making videos or going out on the town. He probably made a good living at it too — judging by his home in the ‘burbs, his apartment in the city and those designer clothes. But looks can be deceiving, and the more time you spend with Howard, the more you start to see through the fast talk and faster money. Uncut Gems, the third film from the electric Safdie brothers (Benny and Josh), opens a world away from Howard’s Diamond District, in the mines of Ethiopia, where two day laborers sneak past guards and excavate a small rock dotted with black opal. As Howard later says, if you look into the opal, you can see all the heavens in the sky. What do the Safdies see? The inside of Howard’s colon. Today might be the most important day of Howard’s life, and he starts it face down on the slab, his doctor searching for cancerous polyps. From black opals to black holes, the Safdies are having fun. They follow Howard as he scurries across town, from jewelry store to pawn shop, from home to apartment, from wife (Idina Menzel) to mistress (Julia Fox), from his kid’s high school play to his in-law’s home for Passover. All the while, Howard promises everything and delivers nothing. Even the value of his opal is in question — he thinks it’s worth a million, the reality is far less. The only thing real in Howard’s life is the constant screech of voices trying to shout over each other and his helpless addiction to gambling. Everywhere Howard goes, it’s a flurry of voices and noise. It makes us feel uncomfortable. It should make Howard feel uncomfortable, but he’s learned to drown it out. Like any addict, Howard has taught himself not to see the numerous warning signs. Most of us would think twice about our life’s choices if we ended up locked in the back of our own car, stark naked, at our children’s high school parking lot. But not Howard. He’s just dodged another bullet, that’s all. He’ll win again tomorrow. Howard does win, eventually. But he also loses. So it goes. The more you watch, the more it feels like Howard stepped off the pages of a Dostoyevsky novel and landed in the streets of New York City. And Sandler makes a meal out of it. There’s nothing lazy about him or the movie surrounding Howard. There’s also nothing satisfying about Howard’s drive — in the classical sense. Howard loves to win or, more accurately, Howard loves the act of winning. There’s nothing left once you won, just the need to move on to the next one — a bigger one, a more dangerous one. There’s only one way this all ends, and Howard is fine with that, as long as he wins on the way out. Due to severe weather this past week, Boulder Weekly is currently experiencing phone outages.

"Dec 26, 2019"," Fraught with edge-of-your-seat tension, “Uncut Gems,” the latest from Boston University-educated brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, stars Adam Sandler as a shady New York City jeweler in deep with the mob for a gambling addiction that knows no limits. The brothers’ last film, “Good Time” (2017) rode a similar arc with a protagonist (Robert Pattinson) living on the criminal fringe, making unwise choices that only amped up a sideways situation. The poor decisions there felt earnest; here, as Sandler’s Howard Ratner teeters atop the tip of a needle 24/7 and so routinely choses the most cataclysmically loaded option at hand, the orchestration of edginess feels calculated and engineered for the sake of taking it up one more notch. That heavy foot takes something away, but still the film remains a scalding-hot sizzle from frame one to the surprising last shot. Much will be made about the choice to cast Sandler in a dramatic lead – he’s known mostly for slack, sophomoric fare such as “Happy Gilmore” (1996) and “The Waterboy” (1998) – but folks can all take a deep breath; the New Hampshire native is more than fine, and feels minted for the part of an overly intense New York Jew with big ambitions, self-destructive addictions and a penchant for bad life choices. The fun part here for Boston peeps is that old friend Kevin Garnett pops up in the cast, playing himself (KG!). If you’re thinking it’s his latter Brooklyn Nets years, think again – he’s with the Green, as the year (we’re told during a colonoscopy) is 2012, and the Cs are playing the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Semis (the LeBron-led Miami Heat would win the title that year) with KG winding his way through New York between road games with Philly. What’s KG got to do with a two-bit hustler? He’s buds with a streetwise operator named Demany (LaKeith Stanfield, so good in “Sorry to Bother You”) who stores his Rolex stash at Howard’s cramped showroom in New York’s jewelry district. Meanwhile Howard gets a covert shipment (in a fish belly) of Ethiopian opals, all glommed together in a two-fist mass. Garnett catches a glimmer of the stone, feels a mystical emanation and decides he wants to hold onto it for good luck during the next game. His collateral? The 2008 NBA championship ring he won with the Cs, which Howard pawns immediately, putting the whole enchilada on Garnett and the Celtics to take down Philly, playing home court. Howard’s an impulsive sort. Did I mention he’s big into a loan shark (Eric Bogosian, excellent) who has close family ties with Howard (they do Passover together, which is awkward, to say the least)? Then there’s Howard’s discerning wife (Idina Menzel), hot and onto it all, and the kept woman he puts up in a posh pad (Julia Fox, who should ride a breakthrough wave after this) and the two sons he hardly ever sees as he bounces from one dicey situation to the next, buying just enough time to make the next poor choice, ever adding to a mounting shitstorm of lies and imminent retribution. Of course push comes to shove as collection goons and KG’s bodyguards come a-banging at the door – let alone an angry showdown with R&B sensation The Weeknd. Through it all, Howard, something of a shrill distant cousin of Dustin Hoffman’s brilliant Ratso Rizzo from “Midnight Cowboy” (1969), keeps squirming even when there’s no place to go. The Safdies aim big and get dangerously close to the edge. What holds it all together, besides a fine ensemble peppered with a bevy of nonprofessionals, is the moody cinematography by Darius Khondji and Daniel Lopatin’s edgy, retro score. Between Sandler’s fast-talking Howard bouncing between a tandem of bruisers with bad intent, a well-fleeced customer on the hook but losing interest and a disgruntled Garnett in such tight confines, the cumulative effect overwhelms with purpose and anxiety-inducing intent. Throughout it all you know something has to give, but you just don’t know when and where the bottom’s going to fall out. As far as the real-life basketball series goes, the Safdies don’t choose to alter history à la Quentin Tarantino, but they do enhance it: KG attributes an early game success to having possession of the titular Ethiopian stone. The one question I had: Was Garnett playing himself, or a pumped-up incarnation? As the demanding latter, the ex-Celt only adds to the mayhem that makes “Uncut Gems” a grabber from the get-go.

"Dec 26, 2019"," Certain expectations come with an Adam Sandler movie. However, I don’t think anyone could adequately prepare for A24’s wager-thriller Uncut Gems. This is not your typical potty humor-filled Sandler flick. As much as Sandler’s name evokes unforgettable images of a flaming bag of dog poop and fistfights with Bob Barker, it’s here in Uncut Gems that he leaves an imprint on cinema. Sandler unleashes a career-best performance as a sleazy diamond dealer and gambling addict who is stuck at full speed. Written and directed by Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time, Heaven Knows What), Uncut Gems once again showcases the filmmaking brothers exploring gritty indie works that probe the New York City underworld. In their latest, Sandler portrays unprincipled jeweler Howard Ratner, who works in the Big Apple’s Jewish Diamond District. Howard’s marriage (to Dinah, played by Frozen’s Idina Menzel) is on the rocks after an affair with a shop employee (a breakout performance by Julia Fox) and his inability to quit gambling. Any big money made at his business is quickly turned over to making high-dollar bets on such things as NBA games. That only scratches the surface in the tightly wound web that the Safdie brothers spin. Everything seems to be specifically designed to give you a heart attack. There are few moments, if any, for you to catch your breath as we watch Howard make one wrong decision after the other. While most people would likely learn their lesson after one swim with the sharks, that is not Howard. No matter what is thrown his way, he figuratively takes on the persona of Scarface’s Tony Montana and is powered by cocaine and unable to be put down with all the lead weight. Sandler is a force of nature in Uncut Gems. Some film fans are aware of what he’s capable of outside the absurdity of Grown Ups and The Ridiculous 6. His foray into drama acting territory — with titles such as Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me and most recently in Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories — is a flex in performance worth witnessing. In Uncut Gems, Sandler is virtually unrecognizable wearing a leather duster, slicked-back hair and diamond stud earrings. On top of that, he has a New York accent and a different way of carrying himself. Oscar members should ready their voting cards. The Safdie brothers delve into raw humanity like no other. They are unafraid to push audiences’ buttons and take risks. The opening alone (resembling Fight Club) features a molecular look inside a diamond that mysteriously exits out of Howard’s derriere during a colonoscopy. In what other movie are you going to see that?",POSITIVE
"Dec 26, 2019"," Howard is a jeweler whose compulsive gambling habit has turned his life into a series of bets, each raising the stakes slightly higher. He's in deep to some bad people — including his brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian) — and in order to get out he needs to continue to up the ante. He's a loser who keeps doubling down as he trudges new depths of rock bottom.  His home life is a wreck; his wife (Idina Menzel) is ready to leave him, his kids have almost nothing to do with him. He's shacking up with Julia (Julia Fox), one of his employees from the jewelry store, whom he's unsure if he's able to trust.  Meanwhile, one of his associates, Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) brings NBA All-Star Kevin Garnett into his store, and Howard sells him on a rare stone from Ethiopia. Garnett feels like he needs the stone, and after his first contact with it has a huge game on the court. Howard needs to sell Garnett the stone to pay back his gambling debts.  The Safdies take these ingredients and bring them to a boil, mixing in the burgeoning career of Toronto R&B sensation The Weeknd (the film is set in 2012, just as he's starting to blow up) and the NBA Eastern Conference Finals, which have never felt more vital. They mainline it all like a drug, and ""Uncut Gems"" plays out like a series of highs, each going to greater lengths to top itself, undercut with a feeling of desperation and a ticking clock of inevitability. It's a game where winning just leads to more losing.  You've never seen Sandler like this before, he's in pure degenerate mode, his life a series of short-lived triumphs followed by crushing, soul-eviscerating disappointments. He's a dead man walking, he knows it, but the glimmer of hope from that one perfect parlay gives him what he needs to keep marching forward. Sandler captures the utter despair of a hustler who's backed into a corner but keeps weaseling his way out, and his performance is magnificent.  The Safdies populate their world with well-hued, colorful New York characters, giving ""Uncut Gems"" a feeling of gritty authenticity. It's a breathless journey that captures the exhilaration and the hopelessness of living life on the edge. It's a gamble that pays off, and then some. ",NEGATIVE
"Dec 25, 2019",The Safdie brothers deliver another high-intensity rollercoaster ride with Adam Sandler's best performance of his career.,POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019"," Joe Friar is a member of the Critics Choice Association (Los Angeles) and the Houston Film Critics Society. A lifelong fan of cinema, he co-founded the Victoria Film Society, Frels Fright Fest, and is a Rotten Tomatoes approved critic.  The primal energy that drives a Safdie brothers film is unrelenting. The duo responsible for 2017’s hypnotic thriller “Good Time,” once again wield the pulse of New York City and use it to drive their unorthodox method of storytelling. In “Uncut Gems” the brothers take us back seven years to concentrate on the city’s famed Diamond District where we meet Jewish gemologist Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) who is addicted to basketball, gambling, and infidelity. Sandler has wowed us before with dramatic performances (“Punch-Drunk Love” “The Meyerowitz Stories”) but this time he’s so out of his element and so phenomenal that this performance will go down as the capstone to a career that began thirty years ago. With a prologue set in 2010, the film opens in Ethiopia where miners dealing in rare black opals discover a rock embedded with the stunning uncut gems. It will become the centerpiece of the story written by Josh and Benny Safdie with longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein, when it becomes the property of New York jeweler Howard Ratner two years later. It’s 2012 and Howard is in debt $100,000 to brother-in-law Arno (a very good Eric Bogosian), a loan shark whose goons are constantly harassing Howard. This is why you never borrow money from loan sharks or worse, family. In this case Arno’s ties to the family have probably kept Howard from becoming another body found floating in the Hudson River especially since Howard could have paid Arno back several times but used the cash to gamble or scheme. It’s the typical “robbing Peter to pay Paul” scenario. Howard’s personal life is also in shambles. Beautiful actress and singer-songwriter Indina Menzel, the voice behind the Oscar and Grammy-winning song “Let It Go” from “Frozen,” plays Sandler’s soon to be ex-wife Dinah who’s fed up with her husband’s philandering lifestyle. The side chick is played by newcomer Julia Fox who delivers an impressive debut as Julie, the sexy, young, and ambitious coworker who enjoys the same pleasures in life as her boss and boyfriend Howard; designer duds, precious stones, and cash. Fox, a New York City girl and former model, clothing designer, and onetime dominatrix, helped shape the role of Julia after a chance run in with the Safdies who collaborated with Fox while formulating Julia’s character. In the end it was obvious that Fox was the best choice for the role since so much of her is in the character. The majority of the film takes place at Howard’s KMH Gems & Jewelry shop in Manhattan’s Diamond District. LaKeith Stanfield (“Sorry to Bother You”) plays Demany, a sketchy friend of Howard’s who deals in counterfeit Rolex watches. He also has famous celebrity friends including Kevin Garnett (playing himself) of the Boston Celtics whose impeccable timing places him at KMH just as Howard receives his precious opal-encrusted rock from Ethiopia which has been smuggled inside of a fish shipped via FedEx. Garnett, or as Howard calls him, “KG,” is fascinated by the stone and he asks Howard if he can hang on to it for a day to bring him luck on the court. Howard agrees after taking KG’s Celtics championship ring as collateral which he pawns to place a bet on the Celtic’s game. “Uncut Gems” builds to a crescendo as the Safdie brothers pile one obstacle after another on Howard as he struggles to remain one step ahead of financial ruin, alienating his family, and his own demise. The tension is unnerving as the film draws to a conclusion straight out of a William Friedkin thriller. The synthesized score by Oneohtrix Point mastermind Daniel Lopatin is vital to the film’s ambience as it sets the stage to what could be viewed as a tragic opera. Like most of us, the Safdies grew up watching Adam Sandler comedies. I’ll admit that I love “Billy Madison” and “Happy Gilmore.” There is a throwback to those films in “Uncut Gems” that involves Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter The Weeknd who during the film’s timeline was on his first U.S. tour. Remember that scene in “Happy Gilmore” where Sandler goes one-on-one with “Price is Right” host Bob Barker? Expect a similar moment with Sandler and The Weeknd. Brimming with unbridled energy, “Uncut Gems” marks a milestone in Sandler’s career as Josh and Benny Safdie draw from Friedkin, Cassavetes, Scorsese, and experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage for an unrelenting thrill-ride and one of the best films of 2019.

"Dec 25, 2019"," The role of a reckless diamond dealer is perfect for Adam Sandler. An actor famous for playing annoying louts in comedies, Sandler goes viscerally dramatic as the grating Howard Ratner in “Uncut Gems.” Written and directed by the Safdie brothers, Josh and Benny, with their frequent collaborator, Ronald Bronstein, “Uncut Gems” plunges viewers into a messy slice-of-life story about a New York City jewelry store owner. Laughs are largely not in this dark picture. Sandler’s Howard, a guy who’s always on the hustle, pursues precarious schemes like it's sport. Although his desperate existence is dependably unpleasant, Howard’s risk taking and endless conflicts attract spectators — like racing fans waiting for the next crash or motorists passing the scene of an accident. An obsessive gambler, Howard habitually raises the stakes. His heedless chase for the big score combined with the movie’s close, frenetic style make “Uncut Gems” a tensely claustrophobic tour de force. Along the way, there’s a chaotic stream of deal making, yelling, arguing and swearing. And because Howard often drives his customers, debtors and family nuts, his life sometimes becomes painful contact sport. A loopy electronic soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin, another Safdie brothers regular, bubbles in and out, almost as mockery. Sandler easily becomes the weaselly Howard. The character’s skinny glasses, manicured goatee and mustache and middle-age weight can’t obscure the actor’s famous face and presence. Sandler’s latter-day Jerry Lewis voice and the kvetching his character does are dead giveaways, too. In “Uncut Gems,” an uncut opal extracted from a mine in Ethiopia becomes the principal object of Howard’s dreams and schemes. But true to his love of risk, Howard lends the precious stone to an NBA basketball star shortly after he’s smuggled it out of Africa. The stone’s raw beauty mesmerizes Kevin Garnett, a real-life pro who plays himself. Though “Uncut Gems” is a showcase for Sandler at his most unhinged , Garnett and other supporting players more than carry their weight. Singer-actress Idina Menzel (“Wicked,” “Frozen”) co-stars as Howard’s long-suffering wife, Dinah. Her understandable exasperation with her husband and the fleeting regret he feels about having a girlfriend (Julia Fox) provide some of this drama’s funnier moments. Sparks also fly when Howard’s father-in-law, played by veteran actor Judd Hirsch, shares a high-stakes sequence with his vexing son-in-law. And real-life music star the Weeknd shows up in a nightclub scene that careens into bedlam. Much of the movie’s action and chaos takes place in Howard’s compact jewelry store. A hustler named Demany, played by actor-rapper Lakeith Stanfield, is a frequent visitor. Demany earns commissions for sales to the hip-hop and sports stars he steers Howard’s way. It’s Demany who introduces Howard to Garnett, the Boston Celtics player who becomes obsessed with Howard’s Ethiopian opal. Eric Bogosian co-stars as Anamed Arno, a sullen loan shark who trails Howard in hopes of collecting a delinquent gambling debt. Arno’s patience apparently at its end, he brings two thugs (Keith Williams Richards and Tommy Kominik) along for what becomes an increasingly dangerous pursuit. But the lunatic life of anxiety Howard leads may be what keeps him feeling alive. Whether Sandler wins more awards for “Uncut Gems” or not — he has nominations from the Gotham Awards, Independent Spirit Awards and Broadcast Film Critics’ Association — the psychologically gonzo, intensely physical performance he delivers in the film proves he's earned the honors.",POSITIVE

"Dec 25, 2019"," Then “Uncut Gems” is the movie for you, and I mean that in the most positive way possible. It’s a terrific film, unnerving and relentless, like one of those amusement park rides warning people with heart conditions not to ride. Of course, the temptation is to say, see it because of the flat-out incredible performance by Adam Sandler. And if that’s what gets you to it, fine. But you should see it no matter what; “Uncut Gems” is simply that good. It also reaffirms what anyone who saw “Good Time” knows — that Benny and Josh Safdie are some of the most innovative, exciting directors working today. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a jeweler with a shop in Manhattan’s Diamond District. Actually, being a jeweler seems like more of an avocation — what he really likes to do is hustle, and what he likes to do more than hustle is gamble. Is he any good at it? He seems like a pretty good jeweler, knows his stuff, all that. He’s less good at hustling, and he’s awful at gambling. (Over time, isn’t everyone?) He’s in debt up to his ears, but that’s not the orifice that begins the film. The Safdies begin with a mine in Ethiopia, where a miner is horribly injured. This leads to the theft of a huge, uncut opal, which in turn leads to a trip through what seems like time and space until we arrive inside Howard’s colon; he’s having a colonoscopy. The opal, Howard believes, is his ticket out of debt. He wants to sell it at auction, but there are wrinkles in the plan, in addition to what only he sees as opportunities; to everyone else, the audience included, they’re land mines that will be impossible not to step on. For instance, Kevin Garnett, the basketball player (playing himself), is a sometime customer. (Most of the film is set in 2012, when Garnett was a member of the Boston Celtics.) Howard can’t help himself — he has to show Garnett the opal. Garnett becomes obsessed and convinces Howard to let him keep it for the night. He thinks it’ll bring him luck during a game. Howard asks to hold his championship ring as collateral. If you’re not already a little uneasy just hearing that, it only gets worse. And worse. It’s such cringeworthy material (the Safdies wrote the script with Ronald Bronstein). You want to smack some sense into Howard, or want someone to. But if being held out of the window of a tall building by thugs you owe money to doesn’t improve your decision making, what will? Ah, but it’s enjoyable agony. Sandler is amazing. Everything that may annoy you about him in his bottom-feeder comedies? It’s all here, but employed as part of Howard’s personality. He’s desperate but always scheming. And no one looks more desperate than the person trying not to appear so. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is all but over, thanks to his ongoing affair with Julia (Julia Fox), who is also one of his employees. He’s a doting father when he gets around to it. A Passover Seder combines the best and worst of his life, in ways that are intensely uncomfortable, yet no less powerful — and watchable — for it. Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) also works for Howard, bringing in high-profile customers like Garnett and The Weeknd, who is on his first U.S. tour. Yet whatever good fortune comes Howard’s way, he manages to screw up. There’s one way out — a complicated bet involving Garnett and the Celtics, as well as more bad decisions. If it all breaks his way, maybe Howard can save himself. You’ll want him to — even when he’s unwatchable in drivel like “Grown Ups” (and, cruelly, its sequel), Sandler possesses an innate charm. That’s on display here, too. A good thing — if not for that, the movie would basically be a filmed nervous breakdown. Cinematographer Darius Khondji gives the film a gritty, twitchy feel. The Safdies give it a story and a pace that never lets up. But Sandler gives it life, and makes “Uncut Gems” a must-see movie. Just remember: breathe.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019"," Watching ""Uncut Gems"" is torturous. As you watch a shady protagonist go to increasingly desperate lengths in order to pull off a big score, you get the feeling that things can't end well. In less capable hands, a movie like this might be obnoxious or dismissible. But the spell cast by the directorial team of Josh and Benny Safdie is all-consuming. You can't look at the unlikable characters with disdain, because you feel trapped along with them, and hopeful that they will scramble to succeed. Set over an increasingly disastrous 2012 weekend, ""Uncut Gems"" is a dream/nightmare role for Adam Sandler, and easily his strongest performance to date. He plays Howard Ratner, a New York City Diamond District jeweler who is always looking to cut corners, jump on ill-advised get-rich-quick schemes and run scams on anyone he feels he'll be able to strong-arm or ignore.  That includes his harried wife (Idina Menzel), from whom he strays and promises a divorce that he keeps  on pushing back. His teen children are also among his victims. He does the minimum to keep up the appearances of a family man while constantly running around for ""work,"" which often includes haplessly trying to control his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), who is always exploiting Howard's vanity for cons of her own. Everyone in the film is always working an angle on everyone else, and the shifting power dynamics make for absorbing suspense. Menzel's simmering angst is an ideal complement to Sandler's frenzied explosiveness. The third key component to the cast is retired NBA star Kevin Garnett, who plays himself as Howard's make-or-break client. Nuanced and relatable, Garnett shows off acting chops that match those of LeBron James. Garnett shows a similar fire and intensity in his role as he did on the court, and is a formidable presence who looms large over Howard's descent through the layers of his personal hell. It's easy to make the comparison that Sandler -- once one of Hollywood's funniest actors, who has been mired in a creative slump for more than a decade -- is an uncut gem himself. He twists the angst and insecurity he showed in his best comedies into a powerful and relentlessly gripping performance here. The way he manages to get you to empathize with his dirtbag character is overwhelming. I was so thoroughly drawn into the film that I found myself pinned to the back of my seat, murdering the armrests and, at times, gasping and muttering at the screen. Anyone who's ever gambled a little bit too much on a sporting event will feel the chaotic pain and boisterous exuberance that Howard shows while watching basketball games. He makes destructive bets, both on games and in life, without thinking the consequences through, but matches his recklessness with a resigned fatalism whenever things go sideways and he finds himself worse off than when he started. Ever grasping for the next angle that he hopes will let him claw his way out of whatever mess in which he finds himself, Howard is his own worst enemy. Which is saying something, because he is surrounded by nasty and brutal adversaries. There's little pleasurable in the experience of watching ""Uncut Gems."" It grabs you by the scruff of the neck, trips you and stomps you in the gut. And yet you continually come back for more because you find yourself captivated on a level few films ever come close to approaching. With the precision of a jeweler's laser, the filmmakers and cast spellbind you with their alluring and overpowering bauble.",POSITIVE
"Dec 25, 2019"," The new film from brothers Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time), Uncut Gems, is a manic thriller about deeply unpleasant people. As such, it often impresses with its mechanics while repelling with its characters. Their abhorrence is very much the point, and their eventual comeuppance the rotten cherry on top of this noxious sundae, so there is no point decrying failed intent as a reason for why I had had my fill halfway through. The Safdies know what they’re doing, and do it well. I’m just not sure I always want they’re selling. Adam Sandler (The Meyerowitz Stories) stars as Howard Ratner, a New York-based jeweler who is leveraged beyond his means, both professionally and personally. His wife hates him (and with good reason), his young mistress may not be faithful, and his various get-rich-quick schemes have recently failed him, not helped in any way by his compulsive and self-destructive gambling. He is cruising for a bruising, from debt collectors and family alike, who may, as we learn, be connected in startling ways. When Howard finally receives a long-coveted uncut opal from Ethiopia, he’s convinced that its sale at an upcoming auction will solve all his money problems. Not so fast; if anyone can snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, it’s him. To give credit where it’s due, the Safdies keep the story and camera moving at an appealing, if exhausting, breakneck speed, never allowing us to rest for a moment. Perfectly matching their mise-en-scène is Sandler, himself, delivering a frenzied performance as a man unhinged. It’s solid work, though without much room for nuance. The ensemble provides good support, whether from Eric Bogosian (Cadillac Records) as the loan shark, newcomer Julia Fox as the mistress, LaKeith Stanfield (Sorry to Bother You) as a friend/colleague (of sorts), or even pro basketballer Kevin Garnett as himself, though Idina Menzel (Frozen II) is wasted in the role of the bitter wife. The directors play a skilled cinematic game of what looks like messy checkers but is actually 3D chess. Unfortunately, for this viewer, fatigue set in somewhere in the second act, as I simply ceased to care about the outcome. Let the chess pieces fall where they may, I thought, it doesn’t matter: this guy deserves what he gets. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by the film’s final moments, the script redeeming itself with a nasty twist that caught me unawares. This rough gem may be uncut, but it’s sharp and will make you bleed. Christopher Llewellyn Reed is a film critic, filmmaker, and educator, as well as Film Festival Today's Editor.

"Dec 25, 2019"," Cuando se habla de adición, llueven las opiniones acerca de como lidiar con ese problema pero rara la vez que se conversa sobre el efecto interno que produce en losadictos; esa indescriptible sensación de euforia invadiendo el ser. Uncut Gems es claustrofobia emocional agarrándote por la nuca para arrastrarte por una sucia avenida de desesperación, ansiedad e inmoralidad sin freno. No es que noquiera detenerse, es que no puede; como un tiburón que muere si para de nadar. Los hermanos Josh y Benny Safdie nuevamente demuestran ser maestros del cineíntimo, incómodo y crudo. Es como si no tuvieran ninguna esperanza en la éticahumana, queriendo incrustar cada nervio inquieto en una historia que no datregua ni cuando se toma un respiro. Howard Ratner (Sandler) es un joyero en Nueva York que parece vivir con la inquietudmisma de la ciudad dentro de sus venas; adicto a las apuestas, infiel,mentiroso, e inmensamente carismático. Su más reciente cruzada es conseguir unmillón de dólares gracias a una piedra de ópalos incrustados que recibió de unamina ilegal en Etiopia. Es 2012. El país recién se recupera de una devastadora recesión, pero para gente como Ratner es solo un año más de hacer lo suyo. Su joyería, al igual que toda su realidad,está escondida, en un edificio de oficinas, protegida por alarmas, puertas ycristales. Sus clientes son diversos, entre los cuales Ratner disfruta tenerfamosos músicos, y personalidades, incluyendo a Kevin Garnett (interpretándose así mismo), uno de los jugadores más exitosos de la NBA. Cuando Ratner lemuestra el ópalo, el gigante atleta queda inmediatamente convencido que la rocaestá conectada de alguna forma con el. Garnett pide el ópalo prestado por una noche, y a cambio le da su anillo de campeonato.Ratner necesita la piedra de vuelta urgentemente el viernes de esa mismasemana. Pero cuando Garnett tiene la mejor noche de su carrera, quedacompletamente seguro que es gracias por el ópalo. Ratner comienza una desesperante carrera contra el tiempo para recuperar la gema, esquivando los incontables contrariedades que lo persiguen, todos causados por sí mismo, usando su astucia, malicia, su filosa lengua y, porque no, hasta su suerte. Pero la suerte no dura para siempre y el fin del camino se acerca velozmente paraRatner, a quien parece encantarle hundirse cada vez más en su propio hoyousando una pala en cada mano. La cámara de los Safdie sigue a Sandler con la intensidad de necesitar saber quepasará después, descubrir como Ratner saldrá de cada vicisitud que se mete,convirtiendo la audiencia en otro testigo más de los sucesos, casi fingiendoser cine callejero, metido donde no se supone que este. Somos otro personaje másen cada escena sin que nadie note que estamos ahí. Sandler interpreta a Ratner con esa curiosa mezcla de niño travieso metido en cuerpoadulto que lo ha caracterizado pero, tanto el como los Safdie saben que eso yano tan simpático como antes y lo aprovechan hasta el máximo, casi retando lapaciencia del espectador para ver hasta donde lo toleramos. Su trabajo es sutil pero al mismo tiempo tragedia griega en una ópera; a Sandlerno parece importarle si su Ratner te cae bien o no, y aun así logra que te preocupespor el. Sin aviso ni parecer intentarlo, Uncut Gems nos enfrenta con larealidad de que, quizás en el fondo, nos gusta ver gente mala saliéndose con lasuya.

"Dec 25, 2019"," There is nothing polite about brothers Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie’s newest hyper-adrenalized ticking clock drama Uncut Gems. This blistering New York thriller is designed to put the viewer on edge. It is constantly moving, the story’s unctuous urgency a primitive maelstrom of morally dubious human fallacy the consequences of which are a thundering avalanche of inescapable tragedy that will bury anyone unlucky enough to be in its path. At the center of this chaos is a mesmerizing Adam Sandler, the actor delivering his best, most invigorating and emotionally astute performance in years. As terrific as he was in Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories or Judd Apatow’s Funny People, I honestly feel like one has to go all the way back to Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2002 masterwork Punch-Drunk Love to find the actor this level of engaged. Sandler is a bundle of hyperactive intensity as New York jewel merchant Howard Ratner, his edgy manic intensity a constant sprint along a razor-thin tightrope where the slightest stumble will have catastrophic consequences the aftereffects of which are almost unimaginable. Howard Ratner’s life is a constant juggling act. To his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and their children he’s a successful jewel merchant. To brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) he’s a fast-talking charlatan who owes him a bundle of money he’s angrily starting to think will never be paid back. To various bookies and other jewelers in New York City he’s a gambling junky with a serious problem, many of them looking at the man sideways whenever he places a bet or comes calling looking for some quick cash.  As for mistress (and employee) Julia (Julia Fox), she feels like Howard is all that and a diamond-encrusted bag of chips, the much younger woman head-over-heels for the guy.  These are the background elements that are an integral facet of the story the Safdie brothers are telling. The majority of their morality play revolves around Howard’s attempts to make the biggest sale of his career of a valuable blood opal that he has scheduled for auction. To do this he must avoid Arno’s violent thugs attempting to get the money he owes while also trying to stop Dinah from discovering just how much in debt he is as well as continue to keep his relationship with Julia a secret. Added to the mix is Boston Celtic basketball superstar Kevin Garnett who comes to believe Howard’s opal is his lucky charm in a heated playoff matchup with the Philadelphia 76ers, his lust for the jewel nothing short of massive. It all plays out like a hyperactive cross between a hard-boiled John Cassavetes melodrama like Gloria or The Killing of a Chinese Bookie and a character-driven Sidney Lumet thriller like Q&A or Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead. The film is also more of a deft, passionately dynamic homage to the 1970s, early ‘80s works of Martin Scorsese than Todd Phillips Joker even slightly was, Uncut Gems capturing the same urgent agency of films like Mean Streets, Taxi Driver and After Hours with viscerally audacious ease. The Safdies, after already delivering a pair of unforgettable dramatic barnburners with 2014’s Heaven Knows What and 2017’s Good Times, have outdone themselves with this effort, and as difficult as their latest might be to watch the fact I can’t stop thinking about it over a month later speaks volumes as far as I am concerned. Even if the viewer doesn’t end up liking the way the film transforms their innards into a prickly, unwieldy tangle of painfully acidic knots, it’s hard not to admit it’s still a technical marvel worthy of all the acclaim that’s already been thrown its way. The combination of Darius Khondji’s (The Lost City of Z) cinematography, Ronald Bronstein’s (Good Time)and Benny Safdie’s editing, Miyako Bellizzi’s (Patti Cake$) costumes and Daniel Lopatin’s (The Bling Ring) score is a collision of anarchy and tranquility where emotional yin and yang are always in danger of being thrown catastrophically out of whack. Each element works together with forcefully truculent chemistry, the Safdies balancing all of the elements augmenting their production with confident skill and pinpoint precision. But this is Sandler’s show. For a movie that assaulted my senses and made me feel like I was sitting on a time bomb slowly ticking down to explosion, the actor’s magnificent performance is the singular element that ultimately won me over. He is the heart, soul and morally-challenged engine that drives Uncut Gems forward towards its suitably sudden conclusion, Sandler’s best performance in over a decade, maybe ever, a magnetic triumph that needs to be seen to be believed.

"Dec 25, 2019"," The hollowness of materialism is on full display in the Safdie brothers’ anxiety-inducing Uncut Gems. Frenetic jeweler and gambling addict Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) incessantly prowls for the next big score, wheeling and dealing in order to keep afloat even as his mounting debts get him dangled from a window by his ankles or locked in the trunk of his car at his kid’s school pageant. He’s driven by his own insatiability, unable to fill the hole inside himself no matter how hard he tries, making the brazen, impulse-driven huckster a walking allegory for the unsustainability of late capitalism—he can’t possibly keep all the saucers spinning forever.  While some people are paralyzed by fear and others are fueled by it, fear rarely enters the equation with Howard. He’s all id and kinetic energy, a bull in a china shop who just so happens to own a jewelry store in NYC’s Diamond District. Even when his long-shot scheme to acquire a rare black opal—a kaleidoscopic stone that looks magical even in the rough—is about to pay off, the object of his desire isn’t in his hand for more than a few minutes before he’s loaning it to a famous customer, Celtics star Kevin Garnett (himself), who believes the rock possesses mystical powers that will bestow good fortune upon him as he plays in the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals. As collateral, Howard takes possession of Garnett’s 2008 NBA championship ring. He promptly pawns it (temporarily, in his mind) in order to secure the funds to place a bet on Garnett’s opal-enhanced performance.  As one might expect, Howard’s personal life is a mess. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) is a façade for the benefit of the kids that’s nevertheless still in its death throes. His girlfriend and employee, Julia (Julia Fox), will seemingly do anything for him, but still can’t help but stick her hand down the pants of The Weeknd (himself) at a high-profile party. Howard’s kids, spoiled as they are with lavish luxuries, barely know him and expect little from him since he can’t even manage to make it through a full school performance without getting hauled off by thugs working for his loan-shark brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian). And despite his hubris and volatile temperament, Howard is still rife with self-loathing, which compels him to perpetually seek the temporary relief of fleeting pleasures and the not-so-cheap thrill of going all-in with his feverish pursuit of that elusive life-changing payday. On the surface, Adam Sandler’s portrayal of Howard appears as the polar opposite of the only other spellbinding dramatic performance on Sandler’s résumé, the milquetoast novelty-company owner Barry Egan in 2002’s Punch-Drunk Love. And yet, though Barry may have been painfully repressed and Howard is brash to his detriment, both march through their respective films driven by a singular focus, with Barry fixated on scoring a lifetime of free airline miles from a Healthy Choice promotion loophole and Howard expecting a mammoth payday either through the auction of his giant opal or from its good-luck charm properties leading to his winning an unlikely NBA parlay bet. The Safdie brothers frantic pacing is more jarring than Paul Thomas Anderson’s approach in Punch-Drunk Love, and Sandler’s respective characters trend in opposite directions, with Barry grasping at serendipity and Howard barreling headlong into peril. But Sandler’s Janus-faced portrayal of these two characters nevertheless taps into the same well of desperation that he’s perhaps uniquely capable of rendering this distinctively onscreen.  Uncut Gems also bears a two-sides-of-the-same-coin resemblance to the Safdie brothers’ acclaimed 2017 film Good Time. There, the directing duo showcased the humanity behind scrappy criminals near the bottom rungs of income inequality, whereas this latest film illustrates the soulless (if largely legal) excess that’s inherent to rubbing shoulders with those closer to the top. And yet, despite his frenzied efforts, Howard remains small-time in many ways, hawking tacky jewel-encrusted Furby necklaces and goading a family member (Judd Hirsch) to falsely drive up the bids on the black opal at auction. The Safdies don’t offer a cautionary tale, glorification of greed or in-depth character study, but rather a stark, turbulent and mesmerizing ride-along with one man’s futile navigation of late capitalism’s darker and more fickle realms in pursuit of a windfall that always seems just over the horizon.

"Dec 24, 2019"," Retired NBA star Kevin Garnett (left) plays himself in 2012, doing business with jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler, right, with Lakeith Stanfield as a business associate) in “Uncut Gems.” To round out the top five such films I’ve ever seen, I’m adding Josh and Benny Safdie’s kinetic, electric, pulse-quickening, harrowing and brutally intense “Uncut Gems,” one of the most authentic deep-dives into the world of the gambling addict ever put on film. Adam Sandler’s performance as a New York jeweler with a variety of voracious appetites, who has spent most of his adult life trying to beat the bookies (spoiler alert — you’re never going to beat the bookies in the long run), ranks right up there the work of Steve McQueen in “The Cincinnati Kid,” Edward Norton and Matt Damon in “Rounders,” George Segal and Elliott Gould in “California Split” and James Caan in “The Gambler.” “Uncut Gems” is part psychological thriller, part black comedy, part thriller and part dysfunctional extended family drama — and it clicks on all those cylinders. It has the urgent look and jagged style of early Martin Scorsese films such as “Mean Streets.” (In fact, Scorsese is one of the producers of this film.) It is the story of a man who is in a constant state of high anxiety. Lurking around every corner of his life is the very real possibility he’ll be caught having an affair, get beaten up by a bookie’s thugs or mess up a business deal — or maybe he’ll just collapse on the spot, with the cause of death being Overall Degenerate Lifestyle. “Uncut Gems” is set in the recent past of 2012, in New York City. Sandler’s Howard Ratner is a hulking, goateed, leather-jacketed, bling-wearing jeweler who makes no bones about who he is — a hustler through and through. Whether Howard is behind the counter at his store (which has the atmosphere of a chop shop combined with a high-end flea market) hawking a gaudy chain with a hideously glittering Furby, trying to smooth things over with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) OR his mistress Julia (Julia Fox), ditching a couple of menacing tough guys or selling a story to the bookie who says time is running out and Howard better come through with the cash, this guy is always on the run in one form or another. The precise time period is an integral part of the story, allowing the retired basketball great Kevin Garnett to play the 2012 version of Kevin Garnett, a star power forward with the Boston Celtics. Garnett, who went straight from Farragut Career Academy High School on the West Side of Chicago to the NBA draft, was one of the most imposing figures the game ever saw; he’s also kind of … out there. Playing a heightened version of himself, Garnett is nothing short of sensational. It’s one of the best pieces of real acting by an athlete in recent movie history. You see, there’s this uncut gem of a stone studded with black opals, newly arrived from Ethiopia. Howard thinks it could be worth maybe a million dollars when he puts it up for auction in a few days. But when Garnett and entourage visit Howard’s store while the Celtics are in town to take on the Knicks, Garnett is instantly mesmerized by the opal and asks if he can borrow it for a few days. He’ll even let Howard hang on to his NBA championship ring as collateral. Garnett goes on to have a monster game, and he truly believes it’s because the opal has magic powers. He’s going to hang onto the opal just a little while longer. Howard, who’s just as bonkers as Garnett and is increasingly powerless to stop his life from spiraling out of control, makes a huge bet contingent on the Celtics winning — AND Garnett scoring points by the bushelful and grabbing a ton of rebounds.  The Safdie brothers are big proponents of the IN YOUR FACE school of filmmaking. One gets the feeling they’d be almost be disappointed if a few people didn’t walk out of their movies. In “Uncut Gems,” their camera plunges into the depths of a diamond mine — and the depths of a man’s colonoscopy. The dialogue often overlaps, with two or more people talking over one another, like over-caffeinated characters in a Robert Altman film. Things get ugly in more ways than one. As played with raw, ferocious intensity by Sandler, Howard is not without his charms and charisma, but he never asks us to like him. He doesn’t really even ask that of his wife, his three children or the girlfriend he claims to love. He even understands why his bookie (who also happens to be a member of his extended family) might just have to kill him. This is Howard’s world. If you can’t keep up or you can’t bear to see him going down, then get out of the way. He’s not asking anyone’s permission to do the things he does.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," It is not unusual for Adam Sandler to play annoying characters. Starting with Billy Madison and through Jack and Jill, Sandler specializes in people who get under the skin of everyone around them, only to have the audience pulling for them by the end. Uncut Gems, the dark thriller from the Safdie Brothers, takes that formula and deepens it with an unpleasant, irresponsible Sandler character. He plays Howard Ratner, a jewelry dealer, and he’s the sort of guy who is so irritating that it is a relief when others say that to his face. Somehow the film is watchable despite all that, thanks to a staggering command of tone, dense plotting, and Sandler’s inherent charm. Howard is a degenerate gambler. His own bookies almost refuse to take the bets he makes because he has no self-preservation or good sense. Howard wants to bet on the 2012 NBA Finals and he has some insider information: Kevin Garnett plays himself, and after visiting Howard’s store, he lets the NBA star borrow a unique, priceless jewel. The stone might give Garnett some unknowable advantage, and Garnett gives Howard his NBA championship ring as collateral. He immediately pawns the ring, using that money to make his bets, all while he owes thousands to other collectors all over town. He juggles all this while maintaining some veneer of a family life, and making time with his live-in mistress. Josh and Benny Safdie enjoy celebrating cinema’s capacity to make us uncomfortable. Their last film, Good Time, a crime thriller where Robert Pattinson plays an incompetent bank robber who undergoes history’s most idiotic crime spree, was hard to watch—Pattinson’s character kept exploiting vulnerable people, whether they were inebriated, mentally ill, underage, or did not speak English. But in Uncut Gems, Howard is not fooling anyone: Every character knows he is full of shit, and the question is just how much of his scheming they will tolerate. Aside from the dense plot, Uncut Gems has an impeccable grasp on mood and atmosphere. There is a bravura sequence where Garnett and his entourage visit Howard’s showroom, and they get stuck between two security doors. They are effectively locked in a cage, while Howard is busy juggling two phone calls. All this unfolds while Howard’s security buzzer keeps going off. The cumulative effect is so dizzying that it becomes comical. There are slower sequences, like when Howard hides in his mistress’ apartment to surprise her, but even those have an uneasy energy to them. The Safdies suggest Howard’s existence, while unsustainable, is like some elevated form of living where every moment is an adrenaline rush.  To Do This Week is your twice-weekly email roundup of arts and cultural events.

"Dec 24, 2019"," Uncut Gems is a total knockout — both in that it’s a wallop of a film and may inspire a well-deserved nap due to exhaustion shortly after the end credits roll. An epic convergence of nail-biting tension and powerhouse performances, the 2012-set thriller from brothers Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time) features a career-best turn from Adam Sandler, who’s brilliant in uncharted territory that nevertheless feels like an apt fit for his talents. The Sandman stars as New York City jeweler Howard Ratner, a compulsive sports gambler up to his diamond-encrusted Furbys in debt. When his loan sharks all come calling at once, Howard concocts grand schemes and new elaborate bets to turn his fortunes around, apparently unsatisfied with the inherent danger of his already fraught situation. If his financial interests weren’t troublesome enough, Howard’s also a wreck on the personal front. On the brink of divorce with his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), he keeps an elaborate apartment for his gorgeous mistress/employee Julia (Julia Fox, magnetic in her feature film debut) — all part of a wild juggling act that’s a miracle to behold. Thanks in large part to the unified efforts of Darius Khondji’s gorgeous yet borderline intrusive cinematography, Ronald Bronstein’s and Benny Safdie’s razor-sharp editing and Daniel Lopatin’s unsettling score — all under the Safdies’ masterful direction — Uncut Gems maintains a propulsive pace, yielding thick suspense as Howard awaits the outcomes of gambles that are anything but sure things. At the heart of our antihero’s quest for success is the titular illegally-obtained rock, speckled with rare black opals, that he’s sure will net him big bucks at auction — plans that naturally don’t go as intended. Complicating matters and further stoking the dollar signs in Howard’s eyes is none other than basketball legend Kevin Garnett (excellent as, well, himself), who, following a phenomenal piece of editing when he touches the stone and has a trippy vision of monumental moments from his life, becomes convinced that he needs the stone to prevail in the 2012 NBA Eastern Conference semifinals. In the wake of this terrific build-up, and with everything on the line, Uncut Gems culminates in an extended climax so simple yet genius that it’s a wonder the scenario hasn’t been utilized before on film. Sandler’s dark comedic presence keeps the energy high without plunging too deeply into the abyss too early on, but the cinematic victory primarily belongs to the Safdies, who’ve improved significantly as filmmakers since their previous effort.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," Adam Sandler is having a pretty good year in 2019. He’s made a triumphant return to Saturday Night Live as host, and he reteamed with Jennifer Aniston for the actually fairly watchable Murder Mystery on Netflix. With Uncut Gems, Sandler joins forces with directors Benny and Josh Safdie, makers of the excellent Robert Pattinson vehicle Good Time, and delivers the kind of dramatic performance—that being fully committed and thoroughly proficient—he’s hinted at in the past with strong efforts in Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories. As Howard Ratner, a New York City jewelry store owner and gambling addict, Sandler catapults himself into the upper echelon of today’s fine actors—not bad for the creative force behind Grown Ups 2. It’s 2012, and Howard has built up healthy gambling debts with a bunch of criminals, including relative Arno (Eric Bogosian), who doesn’t give a shit that they are related. He’s owed money, and Howard will suffer greatly if he doesn’t deliver. Howard’s solution is to obtain a black opal straight from Ethiopia, one that can be worth upwards of $1 million. That opal could free him of all debt and set him on the path to prosperity, especially because NBA star Kevin Garnett—yes, that’s Garnett playing himself—is ready to give him all kinds of money because he thinks the stone has powers. Simply selling the stone at auction and solving his problems would be too easy for Howard, who Sandler portrays as a hyped-up, out-of-his-mind kook who screws up every chance he can get. Whether it’s his store, or his soon to be gone wife (Idina Menzel), or his well-meaning mistress (Julia Fox), Howard is completely incapable of doing the right thing. Sandler’s comedic abilities come into play because Howard is so messed up it’s often funny, and Sandler constantly mines the humor in that darkness. But, in the end, Sandler isn’t in this for laughs, and Howard winds up being a complete character study, a sad man who doesn’t know when to quit—a man addicted to chaos. This is one of those roles that, quite simply, couldn’t have been played better by anybody else. Sandler was always the one the Safdies had in mind when they were writing the script and, while it took a couple of tries, they finally got their man and delivered a masterpiece. The film doesn’t just thrive on performances; it’s bursting with style and originality in its overall approach. The Safdies adopt a visual and sound style that makes Howard’s crazed adventure a swirling trip. It’s edited with the sort of electricity that keeps you riveted, with psychedelic trips inside opals, and even Howard’s colon, to boot. Apart from being one of the year’s best films, it’s also one of its most original. So what the hell is going on with the awards so far in 2019? After the National Board of Review named Sandler its best actor, he got snubbed for both a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award. (The critics guild I belong to, the Las Vegas Film Critics Society, recently named him Best Actor.) Sandler more than deserves his first Oscar nomination here. His work stands alongside DiCaprio’s in Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood and Driver’s in Marriage Story as the year’s best. So how will Sandler top this work? Honestly, I don’t think he can, but that’s not a dig on him. Uncut Gems is an example of finding an actor, finding his strengths, and displaying them in a way that amounts to performance perfection. Sandler will do more great things in his career, but it won’t surprise me if this should amount to his apex. That’s the highest praise he can get. Dark Waters is an earnest legal drama that spares us lengthy courtroom sequences in favor of in-depth looks at those affected on all sides of the case.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019","When Adam Sandler decides to bag the fart jokes and really act, few actors are better. This is an intense, almost exhausting drama and one of my favorite movies this year.",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," Uncut Gems is one of those “his own worst enemy” capers. You know, the kind of movie where you sit there for two hours watching some doofus constantly trip over his own laces — usually figuratively, sometimes literally — on the way to a personal epiphany about how all his bad choices and lack of useful self-awareness have led him to whatever unpleasant place they lead him to. These movies can be cringeworthy in the protagonist’s pathos, either amusingly so or enragingly so. They can engender sympathy or contempt or — ideally — a combination of the two that nevertheless keeps you on his side. It’s a tricky mix to get the balance to a place where the audience is walking that fine line with the protagonist, the cockiness leavened by poignancy. You should feel like this guy is probably right to hate himself, but you still want him to win. Gems directors and cowriters (with Ronald Bronstein) Benny and Josh Safdie pulled this high-wire act off beautifully with their 2017 film Good Time, in which Robert Pattinson’s small-time crook engages in an endless doubling-down on appalling decisions, but does so out of a desperate love for a brother who is unable to care for himself. His brain may be malfunctioning, but his heart is in the right place. Well, no spoilers. We are dragged along here as Howie alternately runs around Manhattan’s Diamond District and locks himself in his high-security showroom as he attempts to pull off his biggest score yet: turning the large hunk of raw black opal he has imported from Africa into a larger hunk of cash. His plan involves an auction at a fictional luxury house à la Christie’s or Sotheby’s, but before he can get there, he has other, smaller deals to make in an ever escalating series of bad moves: the first involves pawning an item of incredible sentimental and financial value that is not his to pawn. And when his deals go wrong, as they inevitably do, he has to up the ante on himself, hoping for a bigger payoff on the next one in order to keep the juggling act in motion. Uncut Gems is a movie about addiction: Howie is a compulsive gambler — sometimes it seems he will risk obscene amounts of money just for the “fun” of it. And the Safdies mine undeniable cinematic tension out of Howie’s predicament: sometimes it’s physical tension, because people who have lots of cash around to play with are generally unhappy to be the one getting played, and would like to hurt the player. But often it’s psychological tension of exactly the sort you’d imagine: every time Howie digs himself deeper into his hole, you want to scream at the screen for him to just stop it already. Or for someone else to stop him. This kind of tension should be fun, and it would be, if Howie were worth caring about. But Sandler’s smirking is not endearing or even vaguely interesting — except, perhaps, to those who are already fans of Sandler’s typical antics. To me, they are a turd not polishable by the Safdies’ indie cred, and as Uncut Gems lumbers to its finale — at two hours and 15 minutes, it takes too long to get there — I knew that there were only two ways Howie’s exploits could end: either well, in which case he would get to celebrate his triumph, or badly, in which case the movie would get to lament him as a tragic figure. Either would end up infuriating me. And I was correct in this.",NEUTRAL
"Dec 24, 2019"," Since this is the last column of the year, and honestly, I have no idea if I’ll be able to continue this into another year, I’m going to change things up a little. I’m not even sure if anyone is reading anything I write about repertory or limited releases anyway, so we’ll see how I feel about continuing to write all that stuff for free. Wilson-Cairns, which I feel is being overlooked in favor of the technicality of the film, maybe since there are so many stretches without dialogue. Don’t let that fool you. It takes a great deal of research and description in a screenplay to lead to a movie this good, and the writing that forms the backbone of Mendes’ latest and greatest should not be ignored. 1917is easily one of the year’s best film, and though it only opens in New York and L.A. on Christmas Day, it will be nationwide on January 10. I also reviewed Rian Johnson’s comedic whodunnit right here, so I don’t have a ton more to say about it, but I’m so happy that it’s continued to do well since opening over Thanksgiving. If you haven’t seen it and want a fun couple hours at the movies, Johnson’s movie can provide that, but it’s also quite a brilliant twist on the ensemble whodunnit that I’ve generally been a fan of as a kid, and the movie definitely stands up to repeat viewings. I also highly recommend Jay Roach’s “workplace drama,” which is about the Fox News sex scandals, mainly surrounding the news corp’s founder Roger Ailes, as played by John Lithgow. The movie stars Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly, Nicole Kidman as Gretchen Carlson and Margot Robbie as “Kayla Pospisil,” as a composite character, the story following the three FOX News employees as they navigate the difficult Venn Diagram of politics and sexuality (or sexualization). Most of the events take place around the 2016 Presidential Election and Donald Trump’s grilling by Kelly about his statements about women, something that backfires for the anchor. At the same time, Carlson is moved to an afternoon slot, and she decides to fight back against Aisles’ demotion (and her subsequent firing) by getting lawyers and accusing Aisles of sexual harassment. As we learn from Robbie’s character, Aisles gets up to much worse, and I loved what her character brought to the mix, particularly her relationship with Kate McKinnon’s character. I’m thinking the movie hasn’t gotten nearly as much traction with critics because it’s written and directed by men, in the former case, Charles Randolph, the Oscar-winning writer of The Big Short, but we have to give some credit to the amazing female cast assembled and what they were able to bring to the material to make the film far less dreary than it might have been despite the yucky nature of the Fox News world. I also think that attention should be paid to John Lithgow’s performance as Ailes, which is a lot more than a good make-up job. Lithgow is such a nice person so for him to play such an oily, slimy character so well makes me think he shouldn’t be overlooked in the awards conversation. This is now playing in about 1,500 theaters across the country, and hopefully, it will be in even more over the coming weeks. Sort of related to Bombshell in that it explores women’s issues from a very different standpoint, that of Louisa May Alcott’s classic piece of coming-of-age literature set post-Civil War. Greta Gerwig ably tackles far more difficult material for her second feature as a filmmaker, proving that Lady Bird was no fluke. It reunites Gerwig with that film’s Oscar-nominated star, Saoirse Ronan, playing Jo March, the writer who is trying to make her way in life and through her career as a writer.  I’m not a huge fan of the source material but Gerwig and Ronan have created such a marvelous bundle of joy in this film that follows the journey of the four March girls, but does so in a non-linear way that forces to pay close attention. Ronan is wonderful, as always, but I was equally and maybe even more impressed by Florence Pugh, who plays the super-dramatic Amy in a way that makes her far more convincing as the younger and older versions of her character than some of the other young actresses.  I think Emma Watson as Meg might be somewhat the weak link of the movie but she isn’t terrible and I did enjoy some of her scenes. Gerwig’s movie is rounded out by wonderful performances from the likes of Laura Dern, Timothée Chalamet (fantastic as Theodore Lawrence), Chris Cooper, Tracy Letts and others.  Actually, I really loved all of the interactions between Chalamet, Ronan and Pugh, three fantastic actors who I’m sure we’ll continue to see more great things from over the next few decades. I haven’t seen enough of the adaptations of Alcott’s book to really know how this stands up, but it’s the first time I really was interested in these characters and their story, and that’s quite an achievement. Although Warner Bros’ JUST MERCY (see below) is getting a ton more attention and marketing, personally I preferred Chinonye Chukwu’s CLEMENCY (NEON), which premiered at Sundance way back in March but just had a much more lasting impact. It stars Alfre Woodard as a prison warden where the pressures of death row executions have started to take a toll on her personal life, especially with the impending execution of Aldis Hodge’s Death Row inmate, who claims his innocence. This is a really tough drama to watch at times, but with such amazing performances by Woodard and Hodge that it pulls you in and keeps you riveted to what might happen next. I’m a little bummed that Chukwu isn’t getting more attention for her brilliant work writing and directing the film vs. other films like the recent Queen and Slim.  She’s a great filmmaker and I can’t wait to see her next film, A Taste of Power. I’m not as big a fan of the works of Ben and Josh Safdie as many of my fellow critics are, but this crime-comedy (of sorts?) starring Adam Sandler, helped make me see their crazy mode of filmmaking in a new way. While I recommend this with reservations, I do think that Sandler’s role in the movie as Howard Ratner, a New York jeweler merchant to the stars, could help the Safdies break out to a new audience as they certainly seemed to have refined their mode of filmmaking with Uncut Gems, and the mix of characters and situations really make the movie something unlike anything else you’re likely to see this year.  The gist of the story is that Howard gets his hands on a valuable gem from Africa and that seems to change his luck as a chronic gambler where everything seems to be going right for him… until it doesn’t.  Much of the story involves him trying to get the rock back from basketball player evin Garnett (played by himself) who borrows the valuable gem and then won’t give it back.  All-in-all, it’s a pretty entertaining film with an absolutely amazing last act that will expand nationwide on Christmas Day. In case you don’t want to go out in the cold this week, you can also stay home and watch some of the great films now on Netflix. While I assume you’ve already seen The Irishman and Marriage Story, I hope you’ll also check out this wonderful two-hander written by  Anthony McCarten (Darkest Hour), which explores the relationship between Pope Benedict (Anthony Hopkins) and his successor Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), as they try to get along even though they don’t see eye-to-eye on how the Catholic Church should be won. I was a little surprised how much I enjoyed this movie, but it reminded of a little-seen 2016 movie called The Journey, a two-hander starring Timothy Spall and Colm Meaney as two sides of the war in Northern Ireland trying to come to an accord while driving to the airport from talks that have fallen apart.  I’ve long been a fan of Pryce but playing the Argentine cardinal who would become Pope is a fantastic role that allows him to show so much more depth as an actor, but we also learn a lot about Pope Francis’ past and the regrets he has about his involvement with the government’s anti-religious actions. Hopkins is also great, and for a movie that’s mainly two men talking, it’s perfectly captivating. Although it’s been out for a while now and has already been losing theaters, I also recommend checking out Marielle Heller’s It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood, starring Tom Hanks as Mr. Rogers, if it’s still playing anywhere near you, because it’s a really wonderful story about a journalist whose spotlight of Mr. Rogers turned into a way that he can find redemption in his own family issues. As mentioned in my write-up of Clemency above, I wasn’t nearly as crazy about Destin Daniel Cretton’s JUST MERCY (Warner Bros.), which is a different movie with similar elements, this one starring Michael B. Jordon as Bryan Stevenson, a young civil rights attorney who is trying to free a wrongly-convicted Death Row inmate, played by Jamie Foxx. Cretton’s good luck charm Brie Larson (they first teamed for Short Term 12) is also in the movie, but I don’t feel she’s nearly as good, and there was just something about the movie that really didn’t click with me. Even so, it will also be nationwide on January 10 and maybe I’ll try to give it another chance before then.  I was semi-excited about Donnie Yen’s return in the title role of Wilson Yip’s grand finale, IP MAN 4: THE FINALE (Go USA Films), which has the martial arts master who trained Bruce Lee (and whose first name, I only just realized, is “Man”) comes to San Francisco in the late ‘60s to back up his pupil’s desire to teach non-Chinese martial arts. Along the way, he gets into issues with the local martial arts masters as well as the Marines, who believe that Japanese judo is the only proper martial art. As with some of the other movies in the series, this one is mainly good for Yen’s performance and his martial arts scenes, although Kwok-Kwan Chan is also excellent as Bruce Lee in one particularly good fight scene, and there are a few others as well. My main issue with this, as with may martial arts film from China, is that the American actors are written terribly and the performances they’re giving (particularly by regular offender Scott Adkns) are just terrible. It’s a classic case of over-villifying the non-Asian characters to the point of them being a joke, and there are few surprises about who is going to win in most fights. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the other chapters, and martial arts fans will probably like parts of this, but it’s not a particularly good movie when all is said and done. A movie I liked quite a bit more is François Girard’s historical drama THE SONG OF NAMES (Sony Pictures Classics), produced by Robert Lantos (Barney’s Version), another terrific Canadian film that deals with Jewish issues. It stars Tim Roth as Martin Simmonds, a young British man whose family took in a Polish Jew named Dovidl, who was also a violin virtuoso, to live with them just before the start of WWII. The night of Dovidl’s anticipated 1951 live concert debut in London, he vanishes, and years later, Martin, starts to track down his old friend to find what happened to him. It’s a pretty amazing movie, partially due to Roth’s performance, but also the two young actors playing Martin and Dovidl, since so much happens in the past. Like much of Sony Classics’ output, this will probably appeal more towards older audiences, but it’s another original story set during the period of the Holocaust that puts its own spin on the times with the musical element, which plays such a large part in the film. (Clive Owen plays the older Dovidl, but it’s a fairly small role compared to the others.) I’m very excited that The 21st Annual Animation Show of Shows (ACME Filmworks)is returning to the Quad Cinema on Christmas Day, and while I was hoping to write something more extended about this, I just haven’t had the time. There’s an amazing line-up of films from a lot of different countries including Germany, Switzerland, Russia, Belgium and more, but there’s also a couple doc shorts about the filmmakers among the films. The Czech Republic film Daughter was recently included on the Oscar shortlist for animated shorts, but otherwise, it’s a fairly strange mix of films, including the very disturbing Kids. I haven’t seen Wayman Boone’s horror film Apparition (Vertical Entertainment), starring Mena Suvari and Kevin Pollak, but apparently, it’s another horror movie involving an APP that connects to the user to the dead. It’ll open this Friday. A few other things on Netflix over the next couple weeks including John Mulaney and the Sack Lunch Bunch special, which looks like more quirky fun from one of my favorite stand-up comics. That opens on Christmas Eve i.e. today, while a couple new series begin on Netflix on New Year’s Day, The Messiah(starring the wonderful Michelle Monaghan) and Spinning Out.  I decided to take a much-needed break from the repertory stuff this week, but we’ll see what happens with that going into the New Year, and I’ll have my annual Top 25 to share with you all next week!",POSITIVE
"Dec 24, 2019"," Okay, we can officially retire Punch Drunk Love as the oft-cited example of Adam Sandler’s competence as an actor. Sandler is a kinetic force in the Safdie Brothers’ wild, breakneck thriller Uncut Gems, a film that races at such a pace, continually raising the stakes to absurd degrees it might be too much for the weak of heart. And Sandler’s the guy thriving in the middle of this raging hurricane, delivering the best performance of his career and making it look damned easy. The Gambler for a new generation, that classic film doesn’t conjure up a fraction of the desperation and anxiety created by Uncut Gems.. Set in the New York City diamond district, Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a guy who…frankly, it’s really tough to feel sorry for. Howard is that guy you know who just can’t keep his mouth shut, he’s always in some kind of trouble, usually of his own making. Howard may own a jewelry shop, one frequented by NBA stars such as Kevin Garnett, but he’s really just another guy up to his eyeballs in debt. There’s scarcely a person in Howard’s chaotic existence that he isn’t in hock to, and something’s got to give. Claustrophobic cinematography crams us into Howard’s shrinking world, and we walk practically in his footsteps through every moment, every risk, every inexcusable high-risk decision.  EVERY decision Howard makes is terrible, by the way, as if he’s trying to make his situation worse. It can be exhausting, even when Howard seems to have found a way out, because we quickly learn there is no such thing for a guy like him. His ticket out of this seemingly endless cycle of vigs, threats, hustles, and side-bets is a rare black opal diamond acquired from Ethiopia, literally dug out of the earth by poor miners in a sequence that looks like the beginning of an Indiana Jones movie. Supposedly worth millions, Howard intends to auction the jewel off and strike it rich. But of course, nothing is so simple. Garnett enters the shop, thanks to Howard’s associate Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), and becomes entranced by the diamond’s mystical qualities. He asks to borrow it, just for one game, believing it to be an inspiration. Howard…well, he’s just not a smart guy. He makes the absolute worst decision possible, especially with guy around every corner who want their money and are willing to do terrible things to get it. As if the streets weren’t punishing enough, the Safdies go even deeper and darker when exploring Howard’s personal life. Even at home Howard is living one big con. His marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) has been on the rocks for ages, and although they’ve agreed to divorce they’ve yet to let the kids know. Even Howard’s brother-in-law Arno (played by a menacing Eric Bogosian) is after him, and with a pair of mobbed-up goons at his side, too.  And of course, Howard has a side-chick (Julia Fox) as if the pressure wasn’t mounting quite enough. All of this ratchets up in ways that are both hysterically pathetic. When a school function for Howard’s daughter ends with him naked and locked inside of a car trunk, you think that would be rock bottom…even though you know deep inside that it isn’t. A trailblazing examination of greed at its most toxic, Uncut Gems is also about a guy who is willing to do anything to carve out his slice of the American Dream. Howard risks everything to make his mark, and at times you can almost respect him for always betting on himself to come out on top. Set to an electric soundtrack and the Safdies’ dizzying direction, this is a film that will test your mettle like few others do. Somehow more intense than Good Time and twice as haywire, Uncut Gems reveals the Safdies to be filmmakers who revel in the anarchy they cause, and invite others to revel in it right along with them.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," A critical assessment of the merits of a subject, such as art, film, music, television, food and literature. Reviews are based on the writer’s informed/expert opinion.  An early match cut signals the mayhem to come in “Uncut Gems,” the latest filmic face punch from Josh and Benny Safdie: a shiny black opal morphs into a throbbing colon. It’s also a tip to the character played by Adam Sandler, whom you could call a real orifice. He’s Howard Ratner, a jeweller in the New York City of 2012 who seems to spend more time getting into trouble than he does selling precious stones. That’s his colon on the screen, in all its gross glory. A fidgety cat with dyed hair and goatee, diamond ear studs and a bad gambling habit, Howard has a knack for pissing off everybody he meets, which includes his soon-to-be-ex-wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), his mistress/employee Julia (Julia Fox) and the mobsters to whom he’s deep in debt, to the tune of more than $100,000. Good thing the glass doors of Howard’s Manhattan office are bulletproof — although the buzzer that opens them frequently malfunctions, giving the film additional jolts of comedy and drama, depending on who’s attempting to gain access. Howard figures he can solve all his problems by auctioning off that hunk of uncut opal, which he managed to smuggle out of Ethiopia (inside a dead fish) and which he swears is worth millions. He’s both lucky and unlucky to have NBA star Kevin Garnett (who plays himself) as a client. Garnett takes a shine to the rock, setting in motion a series of events that aren’t going to make Howard’s life any easier, to say the least. Watching it all go south, with restless camerawork similar to the Safdies’ previous film “Good Time,” might just fray the last functioning nerve you have in your body. That’s a compliment — and so is the observation that this is the best character Sandler has ever played. He’s so much better as an orifice than as a moron.

"Dec 23, 2019"," The title of “Uncut Gems” could stand in for the whole thing: This is one rough, glittering beast of a movie. It also refers to a valuable black opal, its facets mostly encased in rock, that in the film’s opening scene we see being dug out of the side of a mountain by two Ethiopian miners while their bosses are distracted by a grisly pit accident. That opal will spend the rest of “Uncut Gems” tantalizingly out of reach of one Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a Manhattan diamond dealer, gambling addict, part-time husband, and full-time hustler. Because Howard never stops moving, neither does the movie, and the effect is both exhausting and electrifying. Watching this latest bulletin from the Safdie brothers, Benny and Josh, is like grabbing hold of a high-voltage line: It doesn’t feel that great, but good luck letting go. Howard’s in hock to a shady brother-in-law named Arno (Eric Bogosian) to the tune of 100 large; Arno has called in some out-of-town muscle in the form of two Boston thugs, one of whom (Keith Williams Richards) has a face like the back of a Chelsea cement truck and the eyes of a dead fish. “Uncut Gems” follows Howard over the course of a few days as he stays a step ahead of his pursuers while trying to arrange the deal that will set him up for life (he says): the sale of that opal at auction for possibly a million dollars. Howard has a worst enemy, and it’s himself — that’s the comedy of “Uncut Gems” and its tragedy as well, especially for those unlucky enough to come into his orbit. He has a wife out in the suburbs, Dinah, who’s pretty much done with him, and the pure annihilation Idina Menzel can pack into a throwaway glare is marvelous to behold. Aside from one son (Jonathan Aranbayev) who still worships him — which won’t last the movie — his kids have thrown in the towel, too. Why wouldn’t they, when his daughter’s school play is interrupted by having to get dad out of his car trunk, where he’s been dumped, naked, by his creditors? But the opal, the opal — that will make everything right, or so Howard promises his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), who also works in his brightly lit second-floor retail shop on 47th Street. It’s what he brags to his elderly father-in-law (Judd Hirsch) at a crowded family seder where the Ten Plagues get a full airing. It’s how he hustles Kevin Garnett, the Celtics star played engagingly by Kevin Garnett, into believing the opal has some kind of lucky mojo. (The movie takes place in 2012, during the semi-finals between the Celtics and the 76ers.) When Garnett insists on borrowing the jewel — leaving his emerald-encrusted championship ring as collateral — the stage is set for the movie’s high-tension Rube Goldberg treadmill, with Howard running as fast as he can while getting nowhere. Somehow there’s a nightclub fight with The Weeknd (playing himself, too); somehow there’s money passed along a ledge, a visit to Mohegan Sun, and a last-ditch gamble that any sane person would run from in terror. The movie starts in high gear and stays there, the synthesized squalls of the score by Oneohtrix Point Never chasing the hero every step of the way. They should have defibrillator stations posted in the lobby. Let me be very clear about Adam Sandler in this movie: He is brilliant. The actor makes his living off idiot comedies and every seven years or so deigns to take on a dramatic role, just to remind us he can. “Uncut Gems” is of a higher order than that. Sandler inhabits this character fully and without vanity, working Howard’s ready smile and desperate eyes and needling, never-ending sales pitch into a devastating portrait of a lesser shark, the kind who’s always late for the kill. It’s not an actorly performance; it’s instinctual, unerring — bone-deep. “Uncut Gems” is a New York movie the way directors like Martin Scorsese and Abel Ferrara used to make: street-level, profane, mesmerized by awful men. Ferrara has tended to romanticize such figures, but Scorsese never did, and the Safdies stick to that tradition. (Not coincidentally, Scorsese lends his name to “Uncut Gems” as executive producer.) The brothers grew up in New York before studying film at BU; their father worked in the diamond district; the movie feels set in known territory. Their earlier movies (“Good Time,” “Heaven Knows What”) have been terrific. This one’s the best yet, if hardly for the faint of heart. The Safdies don’t judge Howard Ratner, or celebrate him, or condemn him. They just let us watch from a safe distance, marveling at all the balls he keeps in the air and knowing it’s only a matter of time before they fall. Directed by Benny and Josh Safdie. Written by Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie, and Ronald Bronstein. Adam Sandler, Kevin Garnett, Julia Fox, Idina Menzel, Eric Bogosian, Lakeith Stanfield. At Kendall Square. 135 minutes.

"Dec 23, 2019"," It’s possible that tension is the hardest element of a movie for a filmmaker to create and maintain as they see fit. While there are multiple rules and proven formulas for injecting humor in a scene, eliciting pathos in a dramatic sequence, or even thrilling audiences with spectacle, developing a sense of tension takes a deft hand that is more about a sense of what is right and anticipating audience reactions than it is about following any patterns or previous molds. The Safdie Brothers’ UNCUT GEMS is an exceptional model that deploys, builds, and preserves a sense of tension from the opening shot to the closing credits. Powered by incredible performances from Adam Sandler, Kevin Garnett, Julia Fox, LaKeith Stanfield, and Keith Williams Richards, this anxiety-inducing maelstrom of a terrible person constantly making everything worse is a brilliant character study, an engaging story of various lowlifes, and one of the best films of 2019. Howard Ratner (Sandler), is a man constantly on the hustle. A gift for gab and charm to spare, Ratner is a degenerate egotist who works in the jewelry district of New York City jeweler. His gambling issues spread beyond just NBA bets, including grifts with his friend Demany (Stanfield), a worrisome relationship balancing act with his wife (Idina Menzel), and his mistress/employee (Fox), and a precious uncut stone bought on the black market from Africa. As his bookies become more insistent that he pays up, and his schemes unravel at alarming rates, NBA superstar Kevin Garnett walks through the door and suggests a new angle for Ratner to take. The Safdies’ GOOD TIME was a bold and intense cinematic experience filled with random twists, slick style, and its own share of constantly escalating problems for the characters. That film was somewhat hampered by the fact that too many people that cross paths with the protagonist are essentially innocent folks, or don’t recognize how the extent to his self-destructive and manipulative nature. UNCUT GEMS improves on that previous work by surrounding the asshole protagonist with equally scheming and despicable types, while also having a number of people calling Ratner out on being just the worst. This tweak makes audiences feel less like being unwitting accomplices to deplorable actions while also making it easier to simultaneously hate and root for Ratner. Viewers can hate him because he’s just an inept con man who barely stays afloat while constantly lying to everyone around him; but they can also root for him because it’s clear that he’s not alone in his awful ways in the corrupt world he is frantically moving through. Sandler is incredible as Howard Ratner proving that, when he has good material and cares about a project, he can actually churn out a fantastic performance. The character has to be a papier-mâché Mephistopheles, a person that tries to exude confidence and control but is clearly a moron who is losing is grip on everything; but Ratner also has to be pathetic to elicit some humor and also some pathos as this is just a guy trying his best and can’t figure anything out, especially that he is his own worst enemy. It’s a layered performance that is grating, aggressive, subtle, and powerful all at different times and is the pin that holds this story together. The supporting turns are also impressively engaging. Garnett is great as this version of himself who is a weird and superstitious dude that also likes playing the heel. The Safdies originally wrote this film many years ago, prior even to GOOD TIME, and so the NBA player in question was constantly changing depending on schedules and acting abilities — but clearly it was fated to be Garnett because he is incredibly mesmerizing on screen and a great pseudo-foil to Ratner. Julia Fox does great work as “Julia,” who is a bit of a cipher — it’s hard to tell exactly what she is thinking or her true motivations. Is she another sloppy con artist like Ratner? Is she naïve? Is she a fourth-dimensional manipulator? There’s enough in the script and in Fox’s acting that will leave audiences unsure for the vast majority of the film, which only ratchets up that tension. UNCUT GEMS is full of adrenaline but not in a rushed or frenetic way. Instead it’s more akin to a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die. That doesn’t mean it’s fast-paced—while it moves along at a clip, there are plenty of quiet scenes and comic interludes between moments of Ratner’s continuous downward spiral. But it constantly maintains that street hustle vibe of someone who is always moving, always spitting game, trying to sell their knockoffs or scam someone rube who just happens to be on the wrong sidewalk, with an eye always looking for that elusive “big score.” Ratner is a New York Jewish version of FARGO’s Jerry Lundegaard — constantly trying various doomed schemes who has seemingly chosen the easy path of tracking in lies, despite being pretty terrible at it. That cursed sense of every worsening conditions brings to mind other gritty character affairs with tightening nooses in films like THE GETAWAY and MACHINE GUN MCCAIN. The Safdies know exactly how long to dwell on terrible situations, when to allow a release with a joke or a different tangent, when to inject hope, and when to double down on the ever widening shitstorm that seems to be engulfing Ratner and everyone in his vicinity. UNCUT GEMS an amazing experience from gifted filmmakers who deftly appreciate what audiences need and expect, choosing to subvert those when necessary to intensify the tension and leave viewers as entertained as they are racked with panic.

"Dec 23, 2019"," ""Uncut Gems"" is a monster of a movie. The action is continuous as Howard bounces all over town, attempting to avoid danger and make his mark. Sandler impresses, playing Howard as a driven dreamer and eternal optimist. Even if you dislike the comedian's farcical work, you will have a hard time turning this film away. In their followup to 2017’s resonate indie “Good Time,” the brothers Safdie, Benny and Josh, direct and co-write one of the year’s most unique and engaging films. Certainly not a Christmas movie, “Uncut Gems” has Sandler playing enterprising New York jeweler Howard Ratner. Howard is continuously risking everything for the next big score. As his personal life is falling apart, he puts his financial hopes on a rare rock containing several huge opals. And when NBA basketball superstar Kevin Garnett (playing himself) shows interest in the stone, he's sure to make a mint. But Howard's other problems intercede. The vindictive Arno (Eric Bogosian) and his henchmen frustrate any chance of success. ""Uncut Gems"" is a monster of a movie. The action is continuous as Howard bounces all over town, attempting to avoid danger and make his mark. Sandler impresses, playing Howard as a driven dreamer and eternal optimist. Even if you dislike the comedian's farcical work, you will have a hard time turning this film away. Some viewers will be distracted by the gritty, dirty look of the movie and its Altman-esque sound design. Like the late director Robert Altman’s movies (see 1974’s “California Split”), the audio track contains an earthy mix of constant background noise and chatter. The environments on display are a combination of real and fictional. In an IMDB trailer commentary with the directors, they point out how they used real New York jeweler personalities and shot on open city streets. You cannot be sure what is real and what is imaginary. The run-and-gun strategy had to be difficult for the actors, such as Sandler, used to more controlled conditions. However, given their lead’s standup comedy history, a fact that the Safdie’s often point to in interviews, Sandler’s ability to roll with the uncertainties is part of the film’s charm. And Sandler’s incarnation as Howard is something of a masterstroke. With a narrative set in 2012, the makeup, wardrobe, and hair take Sandler back to that time. He looks bloated, terrible, cheesy, but his smile and shark-like forward movement leave the haters in the dust. This unflattering depiction often has Sandler looking beaten, bloodied, and bruised, not like some sexy action star but as a depressed loser. Then there’s Sandler’s crooked, toothy, mischievous grin to remind us that Howard lives for a dangerous level of risk-taking. The Safdies are students of cinema history, populating their movie with a multifarious combination of past and present talent. We get “Talk Radio’s” Eric Bogosian as a ruthless loan shark. “Atlanta” and “Sorry to Bother You” star Lakeith Stanfield plays a connected conman, who partners with Howard. Idina Menzel (yes, “Frozen’s” Elsa) plays Howard’s jilted wife. And veteran actor Judd Hirsch is a vital family patriarch. On top of that, the Safdie’s convince NBA superstar Kevin Garnett to play himself. And Canadia hit singer The Weeknd is a twisted version of his 2012 self, as well. These elements and the loose, improvisational method work to deliver one of the most entertaining, authentic, and brutal depictions of gambling addiction to hit the screen since Paul Newman played Fast Eddie. After the rollicking press screening for this one, critics couldn't believe how much energy is displayed on-screen. Walking out of the theater, I remarked that it was like going to the gym. “Uncut Gems” is uproarious entertainment with a message begging to be decoded on repeat viewing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," Howard Ratner is a moving and talking dynamo. Howard is a jeweler in the Diamond District of New York City where he constantly wheels and deals, mostly to get money to support his gambling habit. Howard is a compulsive bettor, especially about the NBA, where he bets not only on games, but on individual players, rebounds, points scored — whatever action he can get. And as detailed in the Safdie brothers’ frantic and
breathless “Uncut Gems,” Howard’s obsession blinds him to how those in his
orbit view and react to him. Howard, as encapsulated by Adam Sandler, is a grating
individual. He also is very self-unaware and self-involved. He has no idea how
annoying he is to his wife, his family and other people in his business and
betting orbits. If Robert Pattinson’s repugnant Connie Nikas from the Safdies’
2017 movie, “Good Time” was a nine of 10 on a scale of ignorance about himself,
then Sandler’s Ratner is 12. Howard is not a crook, per se. He’s just a shady character
who juggles his finances like a drunken conjuror. Just when you think he’s
going to drop one object, he is able to recover and keep it in the air. “Uncut Gems,” set in 2012, takes place over one frantic weekend
as he is preparing what he thinks is the deal of a lifetime. Howard has
secretly acquired a rock from Ethiopia loaded with various uncut opals. He
believes it is worth millions and has consigned it to an auction house. Howard caters to many black customers, including
professional athletes. When Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), his contact to black
celebrities, brings Kevin Garnet into Howard’s store, the basketball-wild
Ratner goes crazy. Against his better judgment, he loans Garnet the valuable
rock for 24 hours. Of course, when the basketball star fails to return it on
time, Howard’s world begins a downward spiral. There’s an old joke about a son found guilty of killing his
parents. When he is about to be sentenced, he asks the judge for leniency because
he’s an orphan. That sums up Howard Ratner. Sandler’s characterization is so overwhelming that it
eclipses a strong supporting cast which, beside Stanfield and Garnet, include
Eric Bogosian, Julia Fox, Idina Menzel and Judd Hirsch. “Uncut Gems” is not an easy movie to watch, especially at
135 minutes. Sandler makes it an exhausting experience. Plus, a few dead spaces
could have been trimmed to whittle down the running time.",POSITIVE
"Dec 23, 2019"," Sandler plays Howard Ratner, owner of a successful Manhattan jewelry store that caters to big money clients like rappers and sports stars.  He’s a force of nature, talking fast and loudly, always in motion. A natural showman, he has the knack of making clients feel at home in his shop.  But he has big problems that are clawing at him at once. Ratner’s trying to hold off organized crime bag-men who want to collect on his gambling debts. He’s going through a nasty break up with his wife Dinah (played by with poisonous flare by Idina Menzel), who doesn’t bother to conceal her hatred for him. He’s doing his best to maintain ties with his kids in the midst of chaos. And he’s also trying to placate his girlfriend and employee Julia (newcomer Julia Fox in a breakthrough performance), who notes her boyfriend/boss’s increasingly volatile behaviour, but still indulges her party-girl inclinations.  Ratner’s after a big score. He’s acquired a rare uncut black opal from back channels in Ethiopia, a fabled gem he believes is worth more than a million dollars at an upcoming auction – a sum that ostensibly would solve all his problems. But he makes the mistake of showing the mystic rock to a new client, then-Boston Celtic center Kevin Garnett, playing himself (the movie is set in 2012).  Garnett feels a vibe from the gem and asks if he can borrow it to see if it will bring him good luck on the court. Reluctantly Ratner lends him the stone with the agreement that it’s just for one night. Uncut Gems is the latest film by Benny and Josh Safdie who co-wrote it with their collaborator Ronald Bronstein. They specialize in modern noir movies. In their previous film, 2017’s Good Time, Robert Pattinson’s character, an ex-con, had to move fast to retrieve his mentally challenged younger brother from jail.  It’s a bit of a formula, a construct, but, still not easy to pull off.  Working from their taught, focused script, The Safdies keep the pressure on, moving the story at a break-neck pace, keeping the camera moving, sometimes ‘documentary style’ adding a sense of constant motion and uncertainty. They keep the camera close on Sandler, evoking a sense of Ratner’s claustrophobia, all set to a relentless electronic score that keeps the tension high.  Much of the success of the film springs directly from Sandler.  His Howard Ratner is a charismatic guy, constantly on the move, manipulating, hustling, romancing, selling, doing what he must, to get what he needs.  But he’s also addicted to uncertainty, chaos, and the thrill of the next big score. And that now has brought him to the point of desperation. His own choices have started to strangle him. Ratner has an addictive personality, but he’s not a narcissist in search of attention. Inside of that loud showman is a softie with a big heart. He genuinely likes his clients, loves his kids and his girlfriend. You can see that once he was a guy on top of the world. Now, he’s doing what he needs to make it all okay, but he can’t make it stop.  Uncut Gems. Directed by Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie. Written by Benny Safdie, Josh Safdie and Ronald Bronstein.

"Dec 23, 2019"," Howard Ratner is a man sustained by adrenaline. Even that seems like understatement: As embodied by Adam Sandler in a frenzied, mesmerizing performance that is easily the actor’s greatest to date, Howard is a force of pure, devouring chaos. He isn’t merely addicted to risk; he’s addicted to escalation, driven to turn every encounter into a double-or-nothing wager. His compulsion is to consistently make irrational choices, an urge that at least partly seems like an unconscious attempt to mirror the cascading madness of the universe. The Joker wishes he had such unhinged energy, but Howard lacks a super-villain’s arch self-awareness. He’s a small-minded egomaniac at heart, one whose philosophy – if he can be said to have one at all – doesn’t extend much beyond the next triple-mortgaged hustle and the tip of his own dick. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Howard is also an insufferable asshole. His wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), can barely stand to look at him, and her every interaction with him oozes with contempt. “You’re the most annoying person I’ve ever met,” she half-sneers and half-guffaws in a private moment during their family’s Passover celebration. It’s hard to disagree with her assessment, especially when Howard’s response to such opprobrium is to mumble pleadingly with his wife through his idiot, rodent grin. Of course, one of the pleasures of fiction is that it can permit one to slip inside the headspace of an otherwise awful, intolerable person for a brief period, to safely channel the peculiar vibrations that, in real life, would be positively enervating. Benny and Josh Safdie’s Uncut Gems – a film in which Howard is both the anti-hero and the organizing principle – is an exemplar of this sort of repulsively intimate character study. It’s an excruciatingly anxious work of cinema, one so precisely dialed in to its protagonist’s motor-mouthed, serotonin-chasing wavelength that one must consciously make an effort to blink and breathe while watching it. Uncut Gems unfolds over a long weekend in New York City in early summer 2012, as Howard – an independent jewelry dealer with his own little windowless, appointment-only showroom near the 47th Street Diamond District – careens from one frantic negotiation and grotesque crisis to the next. On paper, it’s undeniably similar to the Safdie siblings’ previous feature, Good Time (2017), in which a live-wire Robert Pattinson sprinted through a single humming, neon-smeared NYC night in search of bail money for his jailed brother. Although Uncut Gems feels like it’s hitting some of the same notes – the jittery, claustrophobic 35mm photography; the grubby, messy authenticity of its urban setting; the sheer, throbbing momentum of the thing – the Safdies’ latest represents something closer to the character-powered street pictures of Sidney Lumet and Martin Scorsese, psychologically speaking. While Pattinson’s wild-eyed, over-cranked magnetism is essential to Good Time’s energy-drink potency, the hapless, small-time dirtbag he portrays in that film doesn’t have much depth beyond his jealous fraternal devotion. In contrast, Howard isn’t just the focus of Uncut Gems’ story: He’s its animating electricity, the irresistible force that keeps it spinning to ever more dizzying heights of nerve-fraying tension. Like all born gamblers, he needs that tension; he’ll put everything on the line just to feel alive. Uncut Gems is powered principally by Howard’s compulsions, although the plot’s proximal catalyst is a million-dollar black opal, an absurdly enormous gemstone surreptitiously chiseled from the earth by rogue Ethiopian Jewish miners and smuggled out from under the noses of their Chinese corporate masters. This theft is depicted during the film’s prelude, which culminates in a psychedelic plunge into the iridescent heart of the opal itself. The camera swoops through shimmering colors that undulate like clouds of interstellar dust, before pulling back out to reveal the first of many dark gags: We’re no longer whizzing through the mineraloid structure of a gemstone, but wriggling through Howard’s colon, as seen on an endoscopic monitor in his doctor’s exam room. It’s a scatological joke at the expense of Howard’s delusional vanity, as well as a more generalized acknowledgement that the film’s protagonist is a pudgy, middle-aged man whose fidgety energy at times feels like a kind of encroaching mortal panic. (“Jews and colon cancer. What’s up with that?” he wonders aloud. “I thought we were the chosen people.”) However, there’s also a more sober thematic point to this visual gag, in that Howard is a man who lives by his gut rather than his head. As is demonstrated repeatedly over the course of Uncut Gems’ 135 agonizingly stressful minutes, Howard almost always makes the worst possible choice at any given moment, prodded by his irresistible and inevitably wrongheaded gambler’s instincts. “That’s that dumbest fuckin’ bet I ever heard of,” a bookie remarks after taking a hefty and convoluted basketball wager from Howard. “I disagree,” is his simple response, as he flashes that shit-eating grin. Howard can’t explain it any better than that, because there’s no logic to it. He has a feeling, and there’s no arguing with a feeling. In this instance, however, it might be a bit more than a feeling. The same day that the coveted black opal arrives in Howard’s shop – smuggled stateside in the belly of an ice-packed fish, one of many scriptural allusions wryly spattered throughout the film – the jeweler is visited by Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett (portraying himself in a low-key but surprisingly nimble turn). He’s one of the many black celebrities rustled up by Howard’s sort-of-partner, Demany (LaKeith Stanfield, enjoyably prickly), a middleman for the kind of athletes, actors, and artists who are easily ensnared by the jeweler’s gaudy pieces and backslapping patter. Basketball obsessive and insecure wannabe that he is, Howard can’t resist showing off his newest acquisition to the NBA superstar – whom he calls “KG” with a bit too much boisterous familiarity – and Garnett naturally becomes infatuated with the opal at first sight. Howard already has the gemstone scheduled for auction at an inflated price in just a couple of days, but perhaps, Garnett suggests, he could just borrow the opal as a good-luck charm for his playoff game in Boston that evening. Howard’s predictable acquiescence to Garnett’s wheedling embodies the horror-movie quality that lurks within Uncut Gems: The viewer will often find themselves murmuring “No, no, no, no” in terror as Sandler’s impulsive adrenaline junkie makes one terrible decision after another. Howard requests at least some token collateral for the opal, so Garnett hands over his diamond- and emerald-encrusted 2008 NBA Champion ring. This Howard immediately pawns to secure cash for a bet on the aforementioned Eastern Conference playoff game, as he’s convinced that his opal will provide the psychological and/or mystical edge to secure a Celtics victory. Of course, Howard already owes money all over town, including sizable debts to his own loansharking brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian), and a pair of granite-slab goons (Tommy Kominik and Keith Williams Richards) who may be moonlighting as muscle for even more sinister and ruthless forces. Howard has pieces of jewelry in hock everywhere – some of which don’t even belong to him – and as many unpaid debts as he does obligations, including the rent on a chic city apartment for his employee-cum-mistress, Julia (Julia Fox). His curdled marriage to Dinah might be at the end of a long, sluggish slide into an inevitable divorce, but Julia seems to have some authentic (if baffling) affection for him. At the very least, they’ve established a strangely durable codependency based on lust, luxury, and an abstracted hunger for the next big score. That hunger provides Uncut Gems with its buzzing, free-fall energy, elevating it beyond the darkly entertaining spectacle of watching an out-of-control man vainly attempt to keep a dozen balls in the air at once. The Safdies and co-writer Ronald Bronstein have crafted what amounts to a breathtaking and cacophonous point-of-view portrait of a high-level risk addict, the sort of person for whom the possibility of a huge windfall (or debilitating loss) is almost incidental to the thrill of letting it ride. It’s certainly one of the most immersive and unsparing depictions of addiction since Trainspotting (1996) or Shame (2011), a work that’s less interested in moralizing miserabilism than in conveying the without-a-net euphoria that might drive someone like Howard to do profoundly stupid things with absolutely no embarrassment or hesitation. Daniel Lopatin’s remarkable electronic score is essential in conveying this mood: alternately twinkling, vibrating, and screeching, but always remorseless in its consuming, tweaker-vision intensity. For Howard, a dispassionate risk-reward analysis is a non-starter because the risk is the reward. The tantalizing possibility that he might emerge a winner is his pearl of great price – the giddy possibility, not the win itself – and one of the most conspicuous achievements of Uncut Gems is how the Safdies give that dream a durable glint of plausibility. For all the film’s grimy cruelty, sad-sack misery, and harsh insistence that any bad situation can always get worse, the notion that Howard might triumph in the end is always there, like a winning lottery ticket fluttering precariously (and tauntingly) on the precipice of a bottomless pit. It makes Uncut Gems simultaneously one of the most exhilarating and exhausting cinematic experiences of the year.",NEGATIVE

"Dec 23, 2019"," The newest Adam Sandler movie, which is also the newest Safdie Brothers movie, makes for a frantic, shocking, nervous, sweaty time at the cinema. It’s a movie that offers joyous highs and abysmal lows. Some of it will make you laugh, some of it will make you squirm. It’s not the kind of Sandler film that will appeal to those longtime fans who bow down to his loud and goofy “Happy Gilmore” side. This shows off the talents of those “other” Sandlers, the ones in “The Wedding Singer” and “Funny People” and the sadly overlooked “The Meyerowitz Stories.” It’s the kind of film that fans of the Safdie Brothers’ earlier efforts, “Heaven Knows What” and “Good Time,” will be expecting, but this one turns up the intensity meter just a little higher. “Uncut Gems” (rated R; in select theaters now in New York and Los Angeles, goes nationwide Christmas Day) is the story of a man with a gambling problem. That would be Howard (Sandler), who owns a jewelry showroom in New York’s Diamond District, and who is addicted to betting on basketball games, and who never seems to have much luck coming his way. He borrows money to make bets, loses the bets, borrows more money – from other people – to pay off the debts, then borrows more – from yet others – to make more bets. In the film’s 2010 opening sequence, set in Ethiopia, a huge black opal is found in a mine. Cut to two years later, and an unpleasant scene in New York, with Howard being accosted by a couple of thugs who remind him that he’s overdue in his payments to a loan shark named Arno (Eric Bogosian). “I’m good for it,” he says. “I’m about to close a big deal.” You have to wonder how many times he’s said that. Then it’s off to Howard’s small, crowded showroom, just as a package arrives, one that makes him almost jump for joy, because it’s that big black opal – that “big deal” he was talking about, which he bought at a bargain and intends to sell at auction for a fortune. But a wealthy customer in the showroom, Kevin Garnett, the former Boston Celtics forward, playing himself, sees the opal, decides it’s a good luck charm, and says he must have it, even if for only one night, and will trade his championship ring for collateral. Nothing good can come of this. All sorts of people are after Howard for the money he owes them – Arno’s main thug, Phil (Keith Williams Richards) is the scariest – he can’t find the opal when he needs it, an affair he’s having with the aggressive and demanding Julia (Julia Fox) is proving difficult, his long-suffering wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) has had about enough of his shenanigans, and that auction doesn’t go quite the way he hoped it would. Accompanied by a loud, annoying electronic score (perfect for the mood the Safdies are setting here), this becomes an up-close look at a man in turmoil, a guy who regularly hits rock bottom, then manages to fall even lower. Nothing goes right for Howard, and even though most of his misfortune comes from his own doing, you feel some sympathy for him. That’s due to the Safdies’ writing, but also to Sandler’s manic performance. “You need to calm down,” Howard is told time and again. But he doesn’t know how. An interesting character trait is revealed as he tries, unsuccessfully, to be polite, even when he’s yelling and cursing at people. It all ends up to be a film in which both Sandler and the Safdies are pulling out all the stops, and it works. Yet, while all of the unpleasantness is spinning around the story and characters, there are a few oddly funny lines of dialogue mixed in, and credit goes to Sandler for knowing exactly how to use his gift of comic timing to deliver them. That part is for the Sandler fans. For basketball fans, there’s some footage of the Boston Celtics/Philadelphia 76ers 2012 playoffs. For those who have joined the Safdies bandwagon, you’re familiar with their penchant for violence. And you have a good idea of where and how all of this is going to end. The rest of you have been warned.",POSITIVE

"Dec 22, 2019"," Howard Ratner is the sort of hard-luck hustler who craves chaos. Ill at ease with any semblance of normalcy, he’s a tailor-made protagonist for another anxiety-ridden fever dream by writer-directors Josh and Benny Safdie, and he’s played by Adam Sandler.  Uncut Gems is an exercise in audacious, unpredictable storytelling. It begins with a close-up of a gemstone’s luster that dissolves into Howard’s colonoscopy, to give you an idea. The price is an assault on the senses akin to a rickety roller coaster: It’s a heady ride while it lasts, but you’re kinda glad when it’s over. Practically dripping with flop sweat and cheap cologne, Howard stomps around New York City’s Diamond District, where he runs a jewelry store with a bottom-line near rock-bottom, as he funnels any gains to bookies and loan sharks. He’s in hock to his brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian), who hires two heavies to exact payback of some sort. Howard’s long-suffering wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), is over it, and plans to take the kids and ditch Howard after Passover. Howard has a plan. He’s managed to import an uncut opal from Ethiopia that he hopes to sell for millions. But when Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett (playing himself quite well) wanders into the shop, Howard can’t help but show off the gem. Garnett begs Howard to let him hold the rock as good luck for his game that evening (the film is set in 2012). With the opal’s auction looming, Howard relents, taking Garnett’s NBA championship ring as collateral. He then pawns it, planning to use the money to bet on Boston’s game, score big, pay back his debts, and buy back the ring. This twisty set-up is merely the first thirty minutes of the film, before everything that could go wrong does. Any time a flicker of good fortune falls Howard’s way, he inexplicably doubles down and digs a deeper hole. His one stalwart is his employee and mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), but when he catches her canoodling with The Weeknd at a nightclub (yep, it’s that kind of movie), he fires her and kicks her out of their love pad. Uncut Gems is loud and brash, with extreme close-ups and a discordant score ratcheting up the unease. Randomness adds to the gonzo milieu: Sports-radio personality Mike Francesa cameos as a bookie, while John Amos (of Good Times and Roots fame) plays himself for about five seconds. All the while, Howard frantically tries to stay one step ahead of ruin. But, like the proverbial dog that catches the car, it’s not clear what he would do if he ever found success. The genius of the Safdie brothers’ script—grounded in greed’s corrosive effects, it’s like the Coens on acid—is that we end up rooting for the otherwise-repellent Howard. Like one of his wagers, this turns out to be a bad bet.

"Dec 20, 2019"," An uncut gem is a stone that is rough on the outside and beautiful on the inside. That description also applies to the movie Uncut Gems, a masterpiece with a tough story and tender heart from indie filmmakers the Safdie brothers. The brothers have pulled this mixture off before in another New York thriller — Good Time — but this has a different vibe. It’s the cinematic equivalent to mixing cocaine with acid, a burst of energy that unfolds like a dream. Josh and Benny Safdie take us on a thrill ride here. Young and full of ideas, these 30-somethings  enjoy pushing the boundaries, and their camera goes places no other director would dare explore. After a prologue in an Ethiopian mine, the camera  is dug out of Howard’s (Adam Sandler’s) intestines during a colonoscopy. It’s a fitting introduction to a man at rock bottom. He’s a Diamond District jeweler slumming it in a sketchy New York burrow, with debt that’s mounting and a family life that’s fading like the clast from a well-weathered rock. “You’re the most annoying person I have ever met,” his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) screams at him. Her criticism is fair. Since Howard left Dinah for Julia (Julia Fox), his shop’s clerk, he hasn’t spent time with his family. That’s probably best for the family, though. This is a man who makes terrible decision after terrible decision. A gambler, hustler and cheater, the character is a touchstone addiction, as well as a metamorphic metaphor for the horrific things that happen when addiction takes over someone’s life. So it’s hard to imagine what Howard would have been without the Sandman playing him. An actor who finds pathos in childish characters (The Waterboy, Happy Gilmore), Sandler makes it easy for audiences to root for even  this despicable character. When NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself) comes to his shop to purchase an Ethiopian opal, Howard shapeshifts into an endearing salesman. Garnett, who was basketball’s fiercest competitor when this takes place in 2012, is determined to buy the magic gem for good luck. “They say you can see the whole world in opals,” Howard yells to Garnett over the noise in his shop. People constantly shout in the background, and these conversations blend with the synth-fueled soundtrack, making the sound design hectic as it immerses audiences in the anarchy of Howard’s everyday life. In recent interviews, the Safdie brothers have cited Rodney Dangerfield as an inspiration for the noisy character. They are likely referring to the standup comedian’s “I get no respect” bit, which could be the bling salesman’s life motto. Julia cheats on him with The Weekend, who gets a cameo in an intoxicating party sequence. Thugs aren’t afraid to double team him at his kid’s play, where they strip him naked and kick him senseless. And Garnett steals the opal at the shop for his playoff series against the Detroit Pistons, which becomes a problem when Howard needs to sell it at an auction. What keeps  the protagonist going despite these circumstances is his fixation with striking it rich. No matter how much money he loses, he keeps betting for the thrill of it. The more he ruins his life, the more the Safdies crank up the adrenaline by shooting in anamorphic format. There’s an intimacy to shooting closeups in widescreen; those shots from far away, peering in on Howard as he rushes through his daily routine, make the audience feel uneasy, as if  we are stalking him from across the street. The authenticity here comes from the cast. Sandler continues to prove his critics wrong by nailing serious roles. With Punch Drunk Love, The Meyerowitz Stories and Gems, the actor has delivered nuanced, Oscar-worthy performances that recall the churlish characters that made him a comedic star in the ‘90s. His Howard is just as childish as Happy Gilmore or Bobby Boucher Jr. but still hints at more underneath. The actresses by his side shine as well. Menzel digs deep into the role of Howard’s neglected wife, her frustration becoming more apparent with every reaction shot. Fox sparkles, and not just because her Julia is wearing Howard’s diamonds. Her genial performance is a nice contrast to the hard-nosed Garnett, who she often shares scenes with, and who assists in tying the story together. But it’s the Safdie’s script that deserves the credit for giving a convoluted story a coherent ending. Everything is connected. Like Robert Bresson’s similarly themed L’Argent, the endless cycle of greed can be traced back to a single piece of currency. In Bresson’s final film, it was a forged 500 franc that eventually led to a handful of murders. Here, it’s the opal that spirals everything out of control. It’s a gem that symbolizes obsession, in a groundbreaking work of art worth obsessing over.",POSITIVE

"Dec 19, 2019"," I could describe Uncut Gems for you, or you could try and hold your breath for a full minute and pretty much have the same experience. Written and directed by brothers Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time), Uncut Gems follows a man who doesn’t seem to take time to breathe. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) runs a high-end, back-channel Manhattan jewelry shop—rappers and NBA stars are among his regular clients—that has him constantly bartering prices and cutting deals. On the side, he also makes big bets on NBA games, often pawning a piece of jewelry here or there to cover it. And while life is busy in his suburban home, where his wife (Idina Menzel) and three kids live, he’s constantly heading back into the city late at night to schmooze at nightclubs with his girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox). Howard must breathe, but he sure doesn’t sleep. The Safdies capture Howard’s frenetic life in two ways: aesthetically and via Sandler’s performance. The score, by Daniel Lopatin, employs synthesizers in a way that makes it seem like the screen is throbbing. Darius Khondji’s cinematography prioritizes colors you only notice after midnight; not neon, exactly, but something more like the cool electronic glow of a car’s dashboard. Add an invasive editing scheme (Benny Safdie edits alongside Ronald Bronstein, who also had a hand in the script) and Uncut Gems looks and feels like some strange combination of casino and stock-market trade floor. I wanted out, even as I couldn’t look away.  And then there’s Sandler, scuttling about and channeling the relentlessness of his comic persona into a recognizable human being. Howard multitasks the way a fish swims—as a way of staying alive. (At one point, when he already has three angry calls on hold, he reaches for an incoming ring with the assurance that this is the one that will save his skin.) When Howard comes into a rare opal, he parlays it into a series of schemes—one involving NBA legend Kevin Garnett, slyly playing a variation on himself—that he hopes will get him out of debt with his loan-shark brother-in-law (a steely Eric Bogosian). Despite how arrogant and annoying Howard is, we still root for him, the way we root for a high-wire tightrope walker.  Acrobats, however, almost always make it, while it’s pretty clear from the start that Howard is doomed. That’s because it’s not the win he’s after, but the rush of the risk. This becomes clear in an insanely intense climactic scene in which Howard has essentially closed a deal with the opal, giving him what he needs to settle his debts, but considers using the earnings to go after a bigger score instead. I won’t say what happens, except to note that there’s something smugly unceremonious about the way the film depicts Howard’s fate. I don’t know if he deserved anything different—there’s a cold logic to the finale—but the Safdies and Sandler had created such an indelible character that I can’t help but feel he deserved something better.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," The constant tirades on the phone, shamelessly ranted out in public, the empty threats, the impulse-control explosions of profanity in inappropriate places, the general shiftiness that makes everyone in his presence feel that this lowlife is somehow hustling you — it’s all of a piece. “I’m broke!” “That wasn’t my money!” “Last time wasn’t my fault. We TALKED about that!” “I’ll handle it! I’ll handle it!” “I’m gonna need a couple weeks on that.” I’m begging you…” “Don’t be mad at me!” “I happen to be a litigious individual!” “It’s in the safe.” “I left it on Long Island.” Sandler may not show us anything that’s new in his limited repertoire in “Uncut Gems.” He just serves up his two or three notes of range relentlessly and often at top volume as this gambling jeweler juggling his business, family, marriage and sickness, risking ruin, injury or worse. The effect is a movie that has a couple of great scenes tucked into a brilliantly excruciating tale that will not let go of its feeling of dread, or its manic energy. If they gave Oscars for Most Unpleasant Performance — and they don’t — Sandler would be the cinch that many are saying he is for Best Actor. I see the same expressionless, nuance-free stiff he’s always been, this time with a goatee, ugly bling, coarse patter and an unfiltered rage that at least this once seems motivated by something. It’s born from razor’s edge desperation fueled by an addiction deadlier than cocaine. If B’nai B’rith issued sanctions for films that embrace ugly stereotypes, they’d be tempted to hand one to filmmakers Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie (“Good Time”) for the nasty “New York Jew” tropes trotted out in this uneven but often riveting drama about a risk junky who cannot control his worst impulses. Loud, coarse, vulgar, Weinstein carnal, greedy and tribal, donning the yarmulke for a Passover dinner that is anything but pious, it’s right on the edge of cringe-worthy. Howard’s sick, and we’re not talking about the colonoscopy that introduces him. He runs one of those tiny jewelry shops “upstairs” from the street life, door-buzzers allowing customers in to get “a deal” on tacky baller bling (a diamond-encrusted “Gremlins” necklace), “fell off a truck” Rolexes and the like. He works with a former street hustler (Lakeith Stanfield) who socializes as a way of networking potential customers — rappers, athletes, etc. — into Howard’s store. Boston Celtics center Kevin Garnett is one of the “whales” Demany cozies up to and lands. Ballers love their bling, and dollar signs dance through Howard’s head as he pitches merch to the star and his entourage. Howard’s married (Idina Menzel is his had-enough wife) with three kids, and is keeping his laziest sales clerk (Julia Fox) as a mistress, in a tacky-swank apartment whose decor mirrors his house, and gaudy/dumpy shop. Howard knows a lot of bookies, and that’s a problem. Anthony (sports talk show host Mike Francesa) is on friendly terms today. That means the two goons hanging out in Howard’s store, shadowing him around town, must be collectors for Arno (Eric Bogosian, gimlet-eyed menace). Arno’s the guy Howard lies to the most. Because there’s this big deal. If he can fend everybody off, just close it, auction off this uncut lump of black opals from Ethiopia he’s had smuggled in for big bucks, all his problems will be solved. The film begins by showing the opal being mined, and that’s the first major contrivance of a seriously-contrived tale. How would Howard network his way into getting a stolen stone from the mine to New York? No, he doesn’t seem the type and no, his explanation doesn’t wash. Another contrivance? Garnett, whose name is similar to another gemstone, WANTS that rock of opals. He attaches mythic, playoffs-altering power to it. And that’s how Howard gets in REALLY deep — with Arno, Arno’s brutish mugs, Garnett, the auction house, with family (Judd Hirsch), the wife, the girlfriend and even the kids he’s teaching to gamble on those few occasions he’s home to watch the games he’s wagered on. As with “Good Time,” the Safdies keep their story on the move, sometimes building suspense, sometimes covering ground simply for the nervous energy that’s expended doing it. The movie has that juggler’s buzz and drive. Sandler’s never been a physical actor, comic or otherwise. Howard’s hustling, lying, cursing and berating are the engine here — his vocal shtick driving the action. His every-dumb-risk is its reason for being. But do we root for him? He and Howard are grating in the extreme, first scene to last. There’s not a single noble or relatable character in this. Even the kids, in so many ways potential victims of Dad’s gambling and the family’s collapse, are tuned-out and annoying. The grating feel of the film is underscored, literally, by an irritating, dated electronic music soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin. The setting is 2012, not 1972. Sandler seems both perfect for this part, and the same old out-of-his-depth Sand-man in it. Put him in scenes with Stanfield, Bogosian and Menzel and it isn’t just Howard who’s eaten alive (a bully easily bullied). They act rings around him. His best moments are with Garnett, a comic sports fanatic feeding the non-actor in the scene enough to bounce off of, and not outclassed for once. Whatever the sentiment to honor Sandler for this departure from the unwatchably bad comedies he’s made his fortune through (now relegated to Neflix), I see “Uncut Gems” as a melodrama that could use a little more polish, no matter how perfect its star is at being what he’s always been best at — annoying.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019"," Jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler, right) and his associate Demary (Lakeith Stanfield, center) try to make a deal with NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself), in a scene from the drama “Uncut Gems.” (Photo courtesy of A24 Films.) There’s broad agreement among critics that Adam Sandler gives the performance of his career in “Uncut Gems,” another breakneck run through the halls of New York greed by the directing-writing team of Benny and Josh Safdie. It’s true that the Safdies channel Sandler’s rapid-fire delivery and manic desperation into the strongest character he’s ever played, and that Sandler gives back a passionate performance. That doesn’t make Sandler’s character any more likable, or his actions less repellent, or the movie any less uncomfortable to sit through. It’s May 2012 in New York’s diamond district, and Sandler’s character, Howard Ratner, thinks he’s mere days away from the biggest score of his life. He’s procured a rare mineral, a stone embedded with uncut opals, smuggled out of an Ethiopian mine. His plan is to auction off the opal stone, make a ton of money and repay the Russian thugs and their boss, Arno (Eric Bogosian), before anybody’s thumbs get broken. Howard’s weakness is gambling, particularly on the NBA playoffs that are underway. So things get really complicated when a business associate, Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), brings in a high-level client: Celtics center Kevin Garnett (playing himself), whose team is locked in a conference battle with the 76ers. When Garnett sees the opal stone, he thinks it’s the good-luck charm he needs, so Howard reluctantly loans it to him for a night. But the stone’s absence causes an unraveling in Howard’s plans, with bloody consequences. Further complicating Howard’s life is that his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), wants a divorce — and when we see Howard maintains a downtown apartment for his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), who works in Howard’s jewelry store, we start thinking Dinah’s got the right idea. The Safdies excel in creating a grimy New York world and creating the characters who inhabit it. In this case, it’s the tiny super-expensive jewelry stores where the doors are double secure, like an airlock in a spaceship, and the riches are both luxurious and ridiculous (like the diamond-encrusted Furby medallions Howard tries to sell). Demany’s connections also take Howard, and us, backstage at the playoffs and into exclusive nightclubs, like the one where an up-and-coming singer called The Weeknd (playing himself) performs. Sandler is so good as Howard, this perpetual schemer and hustler, that it’s unsettling. As the Safdies follow Howard down that rabbit hole of his lies, a viewer may squirm from the tension that’s built, even as the storyline devolves into some “Ocean’s 11” plotting that feels artificial next to the gritty world the Safdies have created through most of this dynamic, frenzied movie.  Opened December 13 in select cities; opening Wednesday, December 25, at the Broadway Centre Cinemas (Salt Lake City).

"Dec 19, 2019"," Danger is an addiction. Itâs not about reward, itâs about risk. The run along the razor, the looking down into the abyss. If you win, itâs over, and whatâs the fun in that? So meet Howard Ratner (Sandler), a mid-tier jewelry dealer in Manhattanâs famous Diamond District. âDistrictâ implies a whole area, like Greenwich or Chelsea, but this is a single block of 47th between Fifth and Sixth. If youâve ever walked down it, that stretch of sidewalk seems busy, but not insane. But the Diamond District is three-dimensional: Beyond the storefronts, there is dealer after dealer, office after office, private showing room after private showing room. And thatâs the realm of Howard, a wheeler-dealer who has a solid business selling stones to ballers and rappers, many of them brought to his windowless store by his assistant/runner/friend-to-the-star Demany. Howardâs a cliche, a wheeler-dealer with a wife (Menzel) and kids in Jersey, and a mistress (Fox) in his apartment in the city. He talks fast, hustles faster, and falls between disasters even quicker. And he is Adam Sandlerâs greatest creation as an actor. He doesn't play Howard: he sweats him out of every pore. In collaboration with writer/director siblings Josh and Benny Safdie (who grew up in the Diamond District and give it vibrant, intimate, seedy life), he depicts a man knee-deep in debt and sinking, much of it to his brother-in-law Arno (Bogosian), and continually hustling, continually gambling, continually robbing Peter to pay Paul, always being hounded by a coterie of Bruegel-esque Diamond District characters (many real people the Safdies know personally). His latest insane scheme is to auction a smuggled uncut opal, which he is convinced will make his fortune. Then he lends the gem on which he has gambled his entire livelihood to Boston Celtics power forward Kevin Garnett (playing himself, as well as appearing in archive footage). Why would Howard do something so clearly deranged? Thatâs the key to this incredible character study of a man out of control. Sandlerâs Howard is a man in free fall who thinks the wind in his ears is the sound of him running a victory lap. There are so many moments when the Safdies give him an out, even playing up the possibilities of betrayals that turn out to be acts of love. And yet he keeps running, running, running, scamming, scamming, scamming. Itâs breathless and breathtaking all at once. The only term is relentless, and for a lot of viewers Uncut Gemsâ third act has been stressful, even traumatic. My response was more one of sheer awe â of the Safdiesâ brilliant balancing act, of Sandlerâs swirling dance of a performance, and of Howardâs sprint through a minefield. You want him to succeed even though you have every intellectual reason to bet against him; or at least, you hope for his inevitable fall to have some lesson he can learn. And thatâs truly where the Safdies excel. Like a young Scorsese, their stories have a thick moral core without ever being didactic. Like Abel Ferrara, they understand that even the most repugnant antihero is human and frail without ever losing sight of the cost of their sins. With Sandler, they have found the perfect Howard because â rather than in spite â of his comic background. Much as with his still-fascinating performance as the nebbish Barry Egan in Punch-Drunk Love, he knows the point at which a character goes from big to absurd and always keeps Howard on the right side of that line. Thereâs one whole sequence set around a high school recital that could have, if played broad, fallen out of a mid-Nineties extended-adolescence comedy of the kind that made Sandlerâs post-Saturday Night Live reputation. Instead, itâs a tender carnage of the ridiculous. Uncut Gems is a triumph of building a world and a character that are so infused with each other that they are impossible to separate. It continues the Safdiesâ remarkable run as the keepers of the soul of New York cinema, and itâs easy to imagine Connie from Good Time quietly casing one of the districtâs store fronts, or Lenny dodging gawking tourists as he sprints for a shift in Daddy Longlegs. Howard is one more character in their story of this naked city, but, oh, what a story his is.

"Dec 19, 2019"," The Safdie brothers — two of the most distinctive American filmmakers to emerge in the past decade, anointed by critics as something like the next Scorsese or Ferrara — are obsessed with capturing a New York unseen by most moviegoers. Their breakout feature Heaven Knows What attempts to capture as faithfully as possible the interior lives and survival tactics of the city’s marginalized homeless population, while 2017’s Good Time unfolds in the deep parts of Queens where trains, tourists and camera crews rarely venture.  Uncut Gems, Josh and Benny Safdie’s latest and most ambitious effort to date, is about another unseen New York — a city quite literally impossible for most of us to enter, an endless barrage of iron-clad doors, bulletproof glass and Upper West Side apartments accessible only to the tippy-top echelons of influence and power. This is a world that’s all about knowing the right people, who can let you in the right places, and there’s always another bouncer or buzzer or velvet rope to remind you of your shortcomings. And the only way to know the right people? Amassing massive amounts of financial capital. The Safdies have found an ideal leading man in Adam Sandler, a performer as unhinged as the lifestyles they depict. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a Midtown jewelry dealer desperately trying to keep it all together. He’s always three chess moves ahead while everybody else is playing checkers. But the only thing bigger than the rocks Ratner moves is his gambling addiction, and time is running out on the many debts he’s accrued. Our protagonist is a little bit like Jerry Lewis with a frustrated libido, his own development arrested while the rest of the world moves on. Sandler’s energy here is still deeply childish and chaotic, but for once, the rest of the world is in step with his tempo; it’s not that the Sandman is a chaotic center that threatens to destabilize society — it’s that society itself is chaos, and there is no center. Like a rare gem under the magnifying glass, Ratner is someone you can peer into but never really possess. The Safdies are less interested in emotion or internal motivation than they are in action and instantaneous decisions, frequently dumping their protagonists into situations with no room for thought or space for reflection, just the immediacy of the moment. Their movies are like a crowded city block, a constant gauntlet of elbows and no way out but forward. There’s hardly enough room to make a decision, let alone weigh all your options. Uncut Gems works as a perfectly pitched period piece about a bygone gilded age, halfway through the Obama years, the sheen of Hope and Change slightly dulled by a looming storm still mostly unnoticed in the distance. In addition to a relentless score by regular Safdies collaborator Daniel Lopatin (better known as electronic artist Oneohtrix Point Never), the film is stuffed with rap hits from earlier in the decade (including Rich Homie Quan’s “Type of Way,” Meek Mill’s “Amen” and Waka Flocka Flame’s “Hard in da Paint”) as well as cameos from The Weeknd and Trinidad James as their younger selves.  The Safdies fill their world with richly detailed supporting characters: fashion designer Julia Fox as Ratner’s sales assistant and ride-or-die mistress, Lakeith Stanfield as Ratner’s connection to a world of rappers and athletes willing to drop stacks on diamond-studded Furbies, Eric Bogosian as a solemn loan shark, Kevin Garnett (playing himself) as both a motivating plot device and the movie’s spiritual center. We’re thrust into these relationships with little context, which works given the high stakes and overall intensity, but more often than not I found myself hungering for even more time in these spaces, more history about Ratner’s relationships with the varied and distinctive individuals that populate his life. Where Uncut Gems struggles to keep its edges sharp is when it makes larger connections between Ratner’s own insatiable appetites and global capitalism. They’re thankfully not overemphasized, but the links established between the exploitative African diamond trade and self-destructive American desires were better articulated by Kanye West in “Diamonds From Sierra Leone” more than a decade ago.  In a recent New York Times Magazine article about Sandler — his first magazine profile in more than two decades — the Safdies mention that they don’t have “the greatest imagination,” and instead harness stories into shape based on incidents and interactions they observe unfolding in reality, rather than inventing it all on their own. That lack of imagination seems to me a fundamental problem in their work: their regurgitations of pseudo-reality are merely re-creation, without the additional benefit of a more coherent political framework.  For the Safdies, capitalism is an endless rat race: at first, we’re all just running in circles trying to beat each other, until we realize there’s nothing to win, no prize, no after-party, not even an end or exit except death itself. The brothers excel at articulating specific kinds of suffering under capitalism, how our economic system isolates, alienates and eventually turns us all against each other. Leave rats trapped in a dark box long enough and eventually they’ll go cannibalistic. But any kind of real sociopolitical critique that emerges in their work feels largely accidental, the natural by-product of examining protagonists who hustle and scheme on the edges of acceptable society. The Safdies are deep in the same rat race they’re trying to depict, heads down, unable to see the light of a better future.",POSITIVE
"Dec 19, 2019",The Safdies deliver another shot of adrenaline straight to the heart with Uncut Gems.,POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Si hay algo que distingue a los hermanos Josh y Benny Safdie es su gran habilidad para llevarnos a través de sub-mundos de la ciudad de Nueva York que jamás habíamos visto retratados en la pantalla grande. Experiencias cinematográficas ultra-sensoriales que nos mantienen al filo de la butaca y con la frecuencia cardiaca a máxima potencia de principio a fin. Uncut Gems (Diamantes en Bruto), su cuarto largometraje, no es ninguna excepción. Con un ritmo frenético que no otorga un solo momento de calma, esta odisea bañada en color neón y acompañada por una pulsante música electrónica a cargo de Daniel Lopatin, nos avienta directo a las entrañas del llamado Diamond District (Distrito Diamante) de Manhattan. Un lugar caótico y sórdido que se ha convertido en el escenario ideal para la realización de transacciones ilícitas, apuestas millonarias, y estafas a plena luz del día. Uncut Gems nos sumerge en el agobiante mundo de Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), un joyero adicto a las apuestas que vive en su propia burbuja, y que gusta de empujar su vida desordenada al límite. Para el protagonista, todo es un peligroso juego de azar, un volado que constantemente pone en riesgo su vida y sus pertenencias. Mientras Howard atiende a los clientes que visitan su discreto showroom, éste debe lidiar también con un grupo de matones enviados para cobrar sus deudas pendientes. Fuera del trabajo, la situación no es nada distinta. En casa, los problemas con su esposa Dinah (Idina Menzel) son tales, que la única opción por considerar es la disolución de su matrimonio. Incluso su temperamento colérico le ha traído fuertes enfrentamientos con su amante Julia (Julia Fox), una de las trabajadoras de la joyería a quien mantiene económicamente. Las cosas se complican aún más para el protagonista tras la llegada de un ópalo multicolor proveniente de Etiopía, el cual supuestamente tiene una cotización de más de un millón de dólares. El jugador de basquetbol Kevin Garnett, uno de sus clientes exclusivos, cae rendido ante el encanto de la piedra, la cual se convierte de inmediato en su amuleto de la buena suerte. Sin otra alternativa mas que complacer las demandas de su cliente, Howard presta a KG el diamante por una noche. Sin embargo, cuando el deportista incumple con su promesa de regresar la gema a tiempo, los planes del protagonista se caen a pedazos. Dispuesto a recuperar la piedra preciosa para registrarla en una subasta que le ayudará a salir de deudas, el joyero se verá envuelto en una intensa y frenética carrera contra el tiempo. Uncut Gems es una experiencia cinematográfica tan visceral que incluso ésta da inicio con las imágenes de la colonoscopía a la cual se somete el protagonista. El ritmo jamás decae, y el nivel de tensión y suspenso van en aumento gracias al increíble trabajo de edición a cargo de Benny Safdie y Ronald Bronstein, quien también co-escribe el guion junto a los hermanos, y al punzante score que suena de forma continua a lo largo de la cinta. El estilo retro-neón con toques de videojuego de los años ochenta es propio de los Safdies, y lo hemos visto previamente en sus filmes Heaven Knows What y Good Time. No obstante, a diferencia de dichos trabajos, aquí observamos una maduración en su estilo que a la vez se complementa con una historia mucho más profunda e interesante. «Así es como yo gano», exclama el personaje principal en una de las escenas más abrumadoras de la película. Las decisiones tan impulsivas de Howard nos tienen con el alma colgada de un hilo muy delgado, siempre a la espera del peor resultado. Uncut Gems es más que la historia de gente como Howard que vive su vida como si todo se tratara de una gran apuesta. Esta es un reflejo de un sistema capitalista que empuja a los individuos al éxito, a triunfar y convertirse en ganadores. Pero todo pareciera ser parte un embuste, de un ciclo vicioso de explotación en el que solamente existen perdedores: desde los trabajadores en la mina de Etiopía, hasta Howard, KG, y los recaudadores de deudas. Y todo por una piedra cuyo valor económico no es más que una simple ilusión. Adam Sandler demuestra nuevamente que bajo la dirección correcta, éste es capaz de brindarnos una interpretación de lujo. Lo hemos visto ya con Paul Thomas Anderson en Punch Drunk Love y con Noah Baumbach en The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected). En esta ocasión, el comediante vuelve a sorprender con un giro muy distinto al que acostumbramos verlo. Lo que hace Sandler es espectacular, al construir un personaje detestable que no solamente se mete debajo de nuestra piel, sino que también inspira compasión ante sus pobres decisiones y su visión tan ingenua sobre la suerte y el destino. El gran descubrimiento actoral en Uncut Gems es Julia Fox, quien comanda el tercer acto de la cinta con gran fuerza y presencia. Impredecible y cautivadora, Uncut Gems es el mejor trabajo de los hermanos Safdie, tanto en cuestión narrativa como visual, al mostrar su madurez como guionistas y directores. Una obra en la que consiguen encontrar el balance adecuado entre estilo y sustancia con el que habían estado experimentando en sus filmes anteriores, y lo logran sin renunciar al sello tan único que les caracteriza. Como toda piedra preciosa, Uncut Gems tiene sus asperezas e imperfecciones, pero su originalidad la convierte en uno de los diamantes más brillantes del año.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," Directors Benny and Josh Safdie double down on the pure rush of their 2017 success Good Time with this adrenaline-soaked thriller.  Adam Sandler gives the performance of the year as Howard Ratner, a New York City jeweler and danger addict barreling through the Diamond District in search of the ultimate win. It’s so easy to luxuriate in the sights and sounds of Quentin Tarantino’s historical fantasy that you could overlook the richness of the text.  Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is Tarantino’s career-encapsulating look at the ways that violence shapes our lives, both onscreen and off.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt deliver the most emotionally vulnerable performances of their careers as soon-to-be has-beens in 1969 Hollywood. Mike Leigh’s epic story of the 1819 Peterloo Massacre played to largely indifferent festival circuit audiences in 2018, and it only received a cursory theatrical release before getting dumped onto Amazon Prime.  Honestly, I wasn’t all that pumped to watch two-plus hours of speeches followed by a bloody massacre either, but I found Peterloo riveting from start to finish. This sun-drenched horror film from Hereditary director Ari Aster haunted me like nothing else released in 2019.  Florence Pugh gives a gut-wrenching turn as a grieving student who follows her turd of a boyfriend to Sweden, only to find terrors beyond comprehension. Peter Strickland’s marvelously overwrought dark comedy gripped me from the first shot of a knife slicing open a box of clothes.  Marianne-Jean Baptiste stars as a lonely single mother drawn into “a prism of retail abstraction” by an evil red dress.  Strickland packs more wildly ravishing moments into the first 15 minutes of In Fabric than most filmmakers could muster in their entire careers. Noah Baumbach ends a decade that included Greenberg, Frances Ha and Mistress America with this painful but hilarious look at an artistic couple going through a messy divorce.  Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are both marvelous in the lead roles, while Laura Dern, Ray Liotta, Alan Alda and Julie Hagerty contribute strong support. Less heralded than the other Scorsese movie released on Netflix this year, but more of a pure joy to watch.  Scorsese builds this “pseudo-documentary” from pieces of Dylan’s 1978 film Renaldo and Clara.  He then sprinkles in some fake-out talking head interviews, even getting Casino collaborator Sharon Stone to join the fun.  Come for the metacommentary, but stay for the face-melting concert footage from Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue tour. For his 21st feature film, the great Spanish director Pedro Almódovar reaches back into his inkwell of semi-autobiography to create the quietly enchanting Pain & Glory.  Frequent Almódovar muse Antonio Banderas sets aside his usual scenery-chewing to play an ailing, Almódovar-esque filmmaker confronting his past. The end of the decade seemed to put many great directors in a reflective mood, and no one ruminates through his art like Scorsese.  Instead of the flash-bang Casino clone that many people expected, Scorsese gave us a bleak, somber story about the inexorable rot created by corruption and violence. As in Snowpiercer, director Bong Joon-ho turns an obvious class war parable into a compelling genre film.  It’s the perfect mix of his penchants for tidy symbolism and unhinged tonal shifts, with a strong ensemble cast led by longtime Bong favorite Song Kang-ho. Like Tarantino in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, M. Night Shyamalan reexamines his past with Glass.  Instead of a culmination of a grand career, though, Shyamalan reaches the rock bottom of hacky gimmicks and clueless storytelling. Just as swollen and painfully unnecessary as the four other Disney live-action remakes of animated films released in 2019.  So why single out Aladdin?  Because you can never unsee dance sequences directed by Guy Ritchie. Kenneth Branagh caps a career built on flavorless yet vainglorious Shakespeare adaptations with this borderline unwatchable turn as the Bard of Avon.  Branagh directs the film with his usual lack of personality or control. Former Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst directs this revenge fantasy for talentless elitists.  Star John Travolta hits an embarrassing new low, and yet his shameless overacting is the only reason to watch this atrocity. Given full access to The Beatles songbook and an irresistible story idea, director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Richard Curtis manage to make a film that misunderstands the appeal of the band more thoroughly than the 1978 disaster Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. Film critic Daniel Barnes and comedian Corky McDonnell host the Dare Daniel podcast, where they do your dirty work by watching and reviewing the worst movies you can imagine. They also host the new Canon Fodder podcast, in which they review random selections from the most recent Sight & Sound critics poll.  Check out their shows on Apple Podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts.",POSITIVE
"Dec 18, 2019"," After an injured miner is carried down the mountainside in Ethiopia, two workers quietly disappear into a mineshaft from which they steal a huge, glistening rock. That scene dissolves into Howard Ratner’s colonoscopy. While Ratner (Adam Sandler) anxiously awaits the results of the gastrointestinal procedure, a mysterious package from Africa is delivered to his jewelry shop in Manhattan’s midtown Diamond District. It’s the uncut black opal – from the opening scene. Since Ratner estimates it’s worth millions at auction, he uses it as collateral to fund his compulsive, high-stakes sports gambling, even though he’s already deeply in debt to menacing loan sharks. But the sparkling gem also catches the eye of NBA Boston Celtics superstar Kevin Garnett, whom his buddy (Lakeith Stanfield) brought into Ratner’s store as a prospective customer. Insisting it has mystical power, Garnett wants to keep the opal temporarily, leaving behind his championship ring, which Ratner immediately pawns. Plus, Ratner’s having a torrid affair with a hot-to-trot employee (Julia Fox), arousing the suspicions of his resentful wife (Idina Menzel), who lives with their children on Long Island. Seemingly intent on destroying not only his business but also his family, fast-talking Howard is incorrigible. Filmmaking brothers Josh and Benny Safdie (“Good Time,” “Heaven Knows What”) recall stories they heard from their father, Alberto, a Sephardic Jew who emigrated from Italy via France and worked as a jewel runner in the Diamond District. That’s how they explain the character study of Howard Ratner. Problem is: the vivid vulgarity is so repetitive that it ceases to be shocking, the chaotic plot is predictable and Daniel Lopatin’s aggressive, pulse-pounding synthetic score is too damn loud! Since Adam Sandler has previously focused his psychotic energy on goofy, childish comedy, it’s perhaps remarkable how he’s morphed into this totally self-indulgent, utterly contemptible scumbag. But spending two hours in his irritating company is sheer agony. On the Granger Movie Gauge of 1 to 10, “Uncut Gems” is a furious, frenetic 5. Except as a change-of-pace for Adam Sandler, why bother?",NEUTRAL
"Dec 18, 2019"," A man is talking to his estranged wife. He wants to come back. He wants to heal the marriage. He says this time he really means it, and to make his point, he asks her to look into his eyes. So she does … and starts laughing. It’s one of the quieter moments in “Uncut Gems,” the story of two days in the life of a degenerate gambler. The gambler is played by Adam Sandler, the wife by Idina Menzel, and what makes the moment so satisfying is that we look into his eyes, too. There’s nothing there. And his effort to look like something is there — that complacent, beneficent smile he fixes on his face — really is ridiculous. “Uncut Gems” is a good movie from the Safdie brothers, Josh and Benny, though at times you might wish they’d stop trying to impress us. The movie begins, believe it or not, with Ethiopians digging for gems in the bowels of the Earth — and then cuts to a monitor showing us the inside of our protagonist’s colon during a colonoscopy. Rarely has a film ever started so strenuously and so unappetizingly. Within two minutes, they have a whole audience thinking, “Come on, already” and “Yuck.” This is where having a style is dangerous. This is what overdirection looks like. The characters are energetic to the point of mannerism. People talk over each other. The actors seem to be improvising, or if they’re not, then the screenplay must have been three times the normal length, because everybody’s talking at once. And sometimes synthesizer tones underscore action, if only to add just one more thing into the mix. Yet almost in spite of themselves, the Safdies get their story across, and they end up telling it well, over a series of scenes, many of them imaginative and well crafted. But here’s the thing about telling stories: You can tell them magnificently. You can strive to max out their potential and even know when you’ve succeeded. But you can’t know if anyone else will care, if the story will add up and mean something to anyone. Without a doubt, some people will watch this movie and immediately be plunged into the world of Howie (Sandler), a diamond dealer in New York, whose life is a tightrope, and he’s running across it. He owes so much money to the mob that the collectors are not only showing up at his business, but they’re following him around. His wife hates him. His daughter has contempt for him. Every time he places a bet, his life is on the line. If he loses, he will not sleep in his bed that night; he’ll sleep with the fishes. The intention here was to make a movie pulsing with tension, and some viewers will be tense. These are the nice viewers, with an advanced capacity for empathy, even for a total, hopeless idiot. My own reaction was a bit colder. Howie is the man his wife sees. There’s not much there, and anyway, he’s so self-destructive that his fate seems a foregone conclusion. All this, plus the heavy style of the movie — the speed, commotion and noise of it — creates as much distance as empathy. It’s hard to get worked up on behalf of this guy. But he’s played by Adam Sandler, and that helps. There’s something about Sandler — in general, but especially here — that seems fundamentally decent and vulnerable, so that when we see him taking absurd risks, we wonder what his mother was like. Somewhere along the line, he needed love and didn’t get it. Our perception of Howie is further enhanced by the casting of Julia Fox, who plays his girlfriend with such guilelessness and such affection for him that we start thinking maybe there’s something in him that we can’t see. This helps, but we still don’t see it. “Uncut Gems” remains, from start to finish, a tale told about an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. By the time it’s all over, nothing is exactly what you might feel. But Sandler and Fox give it the humanity the Safdies wanted there. The movie needed it and got it from the actors.",POSITIVE

"Dec 17, 2019"," But when he steps away from that, as he does in “Uncut Gems,” he proves that he is a true actor, able to inhabit a role that showcases the darker side of society, a side that exists regardless of whether we want it to. The film features Sandler as a high-end New York jeweler and basketball fanatic with a gambling problem who loves the idea of being a high roller, hanging with the likes of the Weeknd, Kevin Garnett and more. He is, without a doubt, a sleazy character, cheating on his wife, running games with bookies and his own in-laws. He doesn’t really care whom he steps on, as long as he can make the one big score of his lifetime. There’s no Bobby “Waterboy” Boucher here, no “Happy Gilmore.” Sandler’s Howard Ratner is aptly named; he’s a pure-dee rat, one who can’t and shouldn’t be trusted by anyone. The film, which opens here on Christmas Day, is very heavy on Jewish stereotypes — Sandler’s money-grubbing Jewish jeweler and Judd Hirsch as his equally bank account-obsessed father-in-law, Idinza Menzel’s bitter wife. Then there is the black bling-needing, superstitious, egocentric NBA star Kevin Garnett, who plays himself. Whether Garnett is as superstitious as he is portrayed to be, I don’t know. But superstition has long been a part of the athlete’s creed, even for wannabe jocks. Shoot, even when I was in Little League, I’d wear the same socks as long as we were winning, polish my cleats the same time and way, and even store them the same way, with the toes pointing out. As for his acting, Garnett is impressive, as is the Weeknd, who also stars as himself, and they serve as foils for Sandler’s Ratner, who sees parallels in their must-win selves and his own practices. Only those parallels are not real. Garnett is an athlete and the Weeknd is a performer. Their individual success is a combination of hard work and luck. But for Sandler’s Ratner, it’s all about achieving his own ends. Ratner even tells Garnett at one point that they have the same drive to win. “Do you want to win by one point or do you want to win by 40?” he asks. Of course, athletes want to win; second place doesn’t pay nearly as well. Yet sportsmanship has always been a part of the game, any game. But it has nothing to do with whatever Sandler’s Ratner is playing. Garnett is a basketball superstar, but he is part of a Boston Celtics team. There is only one member on Ratner’s team: Ratner himself, and he doesn’t care whom he has to backstab to win ... and indeed even seems to find a perverse sort of joy in his lack of scruples.  Lying, cheating and swindling anyone, including those closest to him, are their own rewards. Shake hands with him, and it’d be a good idea to count your fingers afterwards. Foulmouthed, deceitful, egotistical, rotten, unfaithful, greedy and selfish, Sandler’s Ratner is one of the least likable characters I’ve ever seen in a film. Usually, you can find some shred of humanity in anyone, something that gives a tiny reason for sympathy. Not so in this case. That’s what made this a tough movie for me to watch, to be honest. I know there are people like this in the world, probably too many, and probably growing in number in a society that seems increasingly uncaring about the plights and feelings of others.

"Dec 16, 2019"," Basketball is one of the most anxiety-inducing sports there is, a culmination of small wins and looses which all lead up to the final score, undetermined until the clock hits zero. It’s hard to tell which way it’ll go until the momentum shifts. Of course, this is also why it’s exhilarating to watch. The Safdie Brothers have crafted Uncut Gems into a basketball game like no other — add gambling on top of that, and the brothers have created the perfect cocktail of tension, dread, and adrenaline.  Starring Adam Sandler, Uncut Gems follows Howard Ratner, a New York jeweler with a love for basketball, gambling, and making high-stake, self-destructive bets. Howard’s constant betting drives the tension of the film, but it’s painfully impossible to look away. Sandler infuses such charisma in Howard that every terrible decision Howard makes feels like moments of (unearned) hope. As Howard’s belief in his good fortune rises, so does ours, even if the reality is a more desperate cling to believing in a higher power.  A mystical sheen the surface of the film wears manages to mask some of the more insidious natures lying beneath. The opening and closing scenes push into the DNA of the gems that fascinate and entice not just Howard, but NBA player Kevin Garnett (Kevin Garnett), and in turn, the audience as well. Daniel Lopatin’s harrowing score lulls you into the mythic qualities and promises of the luck fortune can bring you before rattling you out of your stupor and straight into an anxious state. The Safdie Brothers  never allow us to stay in that safe space for long before harshly reminding us of the reality of the situations Howard’s walked into as the tension kicks in, even if Howard himself is oblivious. Howard may fly too close to the sun, but Uncut Gems is about more than just the pitfalls of going too far. There’s tragedy, but there’s also wins. The Safdie Brothers make sure there’s enough of each to drive the impact of both up further, going back and forth with each, like the score of a basketball game, all culminating in a climatic finish right as the buzzer sounds. The momentum shifts, and suddenly, the rules have changed.  Bolstered by great performances from Sandler, Garrett, and LaKeith Stanfield, Uncut Gems will have you on the edge of the seat the entire time. It’s the year’s most anxiety-inducing film, but we can’t look away even if we tried. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 16, 2019","  You wouldn’t expect Adam Sandler to star in a hyper-tense drama from filmmakers known for their offbeat, stressful directorial style. You wouldn’t think Sandler, fresh off a string of financial smashes and commercial failures, would even take such a role. And you definitely wouldn’t expect Sandler to receive Oscar buzz calling his performance one of the year’s best. But here we are, in December 2019, on the cusp of the release of Uncut Gems, an astoundingly effective film about a jeweler in New York City’s Diamond District that hinges on the best performance of Sandler’s career.   Lying somewhere in the weird no man’s land between the thriller, comedy and crime genres, Josh and Benny Safdie’s film is an absolute breath of fresh air. It comes at the exact perfect time, when theaters are flooded with heartwarming Oscar bait and humor-focused pre-holiday blockbusters. Uncut Gems counters everything else in theaters with a dark, hyper-stylized look at the unseen side of a famously corrupt industry, but somehow makes it … fun?   The Safdies’ last film, Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson, dropped in late summer 2017 with a kick to the pants of a fairly disappointing season. Pattinson, along with co-director Benny Safdie, plunged audiences into a neon-soaked vision of Queens, New York, imbued with the same palpable tension you will find here.   But where Good Time relied on the instantly immersive style and breakneck pace, it largely lacked for depth to its characters. The film is effective, without a doubt, but lacks a lens through which to view the world — it’s tangible, but cold.   As a flip side to that coin, Uncut Gems immediately clicks, and it’s all thanks to Sandler’s performance as Howard Ratner. A classic Sandler character brought brutally into reality, Howard is a monumental screw-up, but one who's easy to root for. In just the opening moments of the film, we see him get slapped around by debt collectors, lose one of his most valuable employees, and convince NBA player Kevin Garnett to purchase a stone that’s not actually for sale.   Although the movie runs more than two hours, the script is composed with an elegant, rapid speed. These opening moments work to endear the audience to the Howard and set the tone within minutes, but also immediately kick the plot into gear. Put simply, most of the film's runtime revolves around Howard’s desperate attempt to pay off debt collectors through a somewhat hairbrained scheme to make a fortune by selling an uncut gem from Ethiopia.   Of course, no part of Howard’s life goes according to plan; everything goes off the rails, and he’s left trying to piece together his broken life and his broken plans on-the-fly. It’s an exhilarating roller coaster of a story, whipping from highs to lows within minutes.   As Howard barely scrapes past aggressive debt collectors, an aging NBA star desperate for a good luck charm and a deceptive employee (LaKeith Stanfield), he’s also attempting to make a massive transition in his personal life. After cheating on his wife (Idina Menzel) with employee and now-girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox), the two are negotiating a divorce. Clearly running low on hours in the day, Howard has to figure out how to break the news to his children while balancing the thousand other pressing issues.   If this sounds like a lot, it absolutely is. The script brilliantly never leaves a single plot line dormant for too long and always keeps every aspect of Howard’s life relevant, but once you get about 90 minutes in, it becomes overwhelming. Though a pitch-perfect immersion into the Safdies’ panic-attack of a world, the movie absolutely won’t be for everyone.   Another thing that may limit Uncut Gems’ potential to latch on to general audiences is just how *weird* everything is. Because of Garnett’s involvement in the story, a piece of Howard’s entire financial well-being is tied to the 2012 NBA Eastern Conference Semifinals between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. At roughly the story’s midpoint, musical artist The Weeknd cameos as himself in 2012. There are many intense scenes where characters panic and frantically yell at one another while accomplishing very little. These small, specific details, in service of evoking the atmosphere, are brilliantly compelling, but it’s that very specificity that may put some audience members off.   But in the end, it’s not the narrative, the cameos, or even the oppressive direction that people will discuss when the mention this movie, but Sandler himself. Easily outdoing every performance that’s come before, Sandler uses his skill as a comedic loser, but strips the irony out. Much like the way Jason Bateman’s character in the 2015 film The Gift is a typical, Michael Bluth-style sardonic straight man but without the humor, The Sandman is simply a pathetic human trying to survive, but without impressive golf skills or a magical remote.   Though they’re all overwhelmed by Sandler’s dynamic, subversive turn, each other performance in the film is a blast to watch. Acting rookies Julia Fox and Kevin Garnett shine particularly bright, absorbing Sandler’s on-screen energy like sponges. They push, pull and test the protagonist, but also feel human themselves. Fox, Howard’s fierce, much younger girlfriend, is one of the only characters in the movie who is actually earnest. Everything she says is said with honesty, as she’s one of the few people not running a larger scheme, and is wonderfully believable. On the other hand, Garnett (“KG!”) quickly breaks past the Shaq-sized shadow that hovers over athletes who attempt a transition to the screen, dramatizing himself with his own powerful dose of humanity. Rather than do a larger-than-life parody of himself (the way The Weeknd does later in the movie), Garnett focuses his efforts on playing the aging star he actually was in 2012, albeit with a fictional desperation for an Ethiopian gem.   A brilliant subversion of Adam Sandler’s career, a palpable exercise in one’s ability to navigate stressful environments and an oddly specific look at NYC’s diamond district in 2012, Uncut Gems is a damn-near perfect film. It’s packed to the brim with human characters and unbelievably stressful, and features one of the most lovably unlucky characters of all time. Though not as earth-shaking as some other recent films like The Irishman or Parasite, Uncut Gems is easily among the year’s best movies. Instantly engaging, it’s a masterfully crafted run across the edge of a blade that never lets up. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 14, 2019","Uncut Gems is a breathless film; it will literally take your breath away. It's almost panic attack -inducing and at the very least, heart-rate increasingly tense, a viscerally physical cinema experience.",POSITIVE
"Dec 14, 2019"," 
In their follow-up to the underrated Good Time, the
Safdie Brothers (Benny and Josh) have shown that the some of the most forceful
qualities evident in their previous film were more trademarks than one-off
experiments. Uncut Gems, although very different from a narrative
perspective, is cut from the same cloth. The edgy, claustrophobic approach to
filmmaking is there, as is the importance of setting. There’s never a clear
sense of where the movie is headed and, when it gets there, it arrives with a
bang. Most notably, the Safdies pluck a well-known actor (Robert Pattison in Good
Time; Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems) and place him in a role to which
he is unaccustomed but which takes advantage of previously hidden strengths. Uncut Gems transpires against the backdrop of the New
York City diamond market. It’s a corrupt, chaotic world that has provided color
and content to more than a few motion pictures over the years. Here, the
Safdies make it a character, with the streets populated by shysters and con
men, and the gemstone dealers often less reputable than the men prowling the
byways outside their shops. It’s here that we meet Howard Ratner (Sandler), the
film’s volcanic protagonist who, like Vesuvius, appears constantly on the verge
of an eruption. A philanderer, compulsive gambler, and all-around crook, Howard
is driven by his base impulses to the detriment of everyone around him,
including his long-suffering (and soon to be ex) wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel),
and his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox). He’s deep in debt to his brother-in-law,
Arno (Eric Bogosian), whose thuggish allies are more than happy to apply force
when needed. He’s in over his head but thinks if he keeps dancing through the
raindrops, he’ll find a rainbow and the pot of gold at the other end. He
doesn’t realize that leprechauns don’t really exist.  Howard has in his possession the ultimate McGuffin.  It’s a piece of unremarkable rock embedded
with multicolored opals. He claims it’s worth millions of dollars and intends
to sell it at auction to clear his debts and provide money for more gambling.
Basketball superstar Kevin Garnett (playing himself), accompanied to Howard’s
store by business associate Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), takes an interest in
the stone, believing it to have magical powers. He arranges a temporary trade:
in return for his Celtics championship ring, he’ll borrow the stone. When it
comes time for Howard to reclaim his property, however, Garnett proves to be
elusive and the clock is ticking.  Observing Howard go about his daily life is like watching a
juggler…but not any juggler. Instead of tossing balls in the air, he does his
work with flaming swords and running chainsaws. It’s breathtaking when he’s in
a rhythm but even the slightest hiccup can provoke disaster. The Safdies imbue
every scene with a restless edginess that mirrors the ADHD behavior of the main
character. Howard is defined by his lack of maturity and impulse control; he needs
anger management. There’s nothing comfortable about watching him navigate the
train wreck of a life but it’s compulsive. Love it or hate it, Uncut Gems
is unlikely to provoke apathy. Sight unseen, Sandler might seem to be an odd choice (to say
the least) as the film’s central character. Howard is intended to be
charismatic but not funny and Sandler is all-in on this portrayal, allowing the
less flattering elements of his on-screen persona – that of an
emotionally-stunted, angry man-child – to be channeled in a serious fashion. To
be fair, this is not the first time Sandler has attempted a dramatic role – he
has done so with some success on several previous occasions including Punch Drunk Love and Funny People – but this is the first time when has
done so without the safety net of the movie in question being labeled a
“dramatic comedy.” The result is a performance that echoes Dustin Hoffman as
Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy both in terms of delivery and approach.
It validates Sandler as more than a profane comedian who caters to a least
common-denominator audience. As is the case with most uncompromising thrillers that rely
more on narrative elements than action scenes, Uncut Gems may not appeal
to those who don’t appreciate the slow-burn approach. Terms like “gritty” and
“exhausting” apply. Although aspects of the storyline may seem familiar, the
overall trajectory retains the capacity to surprise and shock with its
bluntness. The Safdies have a preferred aesthetic and mood and remain true to
it throughout. For those who appreciate this sort of modern-day neo noir
experience, it gleams as hypnotically as the titular totem. ",POSITIVE

"Dec 13, 2019"," “Holy shit I’m gonna cum!” moans Manhattan Diamond District merchant Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), ogling a hoagie-sized opal heavily encrusted with African sediment. Obsession begets obsession in Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems, a pulsating thriller about one man’s insatiable gambling habit and the chaos he leaves in his wake. The feverish film starts with a Thursday morning colonoscopy, includes a Saturday Passover Seder, and climaxes with Monday night’s Game Seven of the 2012 NBA finals. The five-day stretch virtually shimmers with flop sweat, but watching it is an absolute joy. It’s the ecstasy of agony. And it all starts with, you guessed it, an uncut gem. Howard scoops it out of a shrink-wrapped bass buried in packing ice and Styrofoam, illegally shipped from an Ethiopian Welo mine. The opal already drew blood, when it caused a tibial shaft fracture to rip through an exhausted worker’s leg. And now its arrival in Howard’s life is about bring even more pain. Excess is just a matter of opinion for Howard, a maxed-out maximalist. His divorce-thirsty wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) thinks he’s a fuck-up. His showroom mistress Julia (Julia Fox) perpetually trashes his East Side love nest.  And his creditors are sick of the $20,000 watches he shoves in their faces as shut-the-fuck-up partial payments. “He’s just a fucking crazy-ass Jew,” says Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), a resentful employee who lures celebrity athletes into Howard’s security-heavy store. In walks Celtics champ Kevin Garnett (playing himself), and Howard can’t help but show off the Middle-Earth enchantments of his presumably 10-million-year-old Ethiopian opal. He tells Garnett it’s worth over a million dollars. “They say you can see the whole universe,” Howard says, inviting Garnett to stare into the gem’s 4,000 karats. Garnett dives in so deeply he shatters the glass countertop. “This fucking thing makes me feel I can fly,” he says. So off he goes, borrowing it as a talisman for his game that night and leaving Howard his 2008 championship ring as collateral. Howard, of course, immediately pawns the ring (for $21k, plus a 7% vig) and bets it all on Garnett. That’s when the trouble really starts, as loan-shark thugs circle Howard relentlessly, up-and-comer The Weeknd makes moves on wannabe music promoter Julia, and tony auction house Adley’s keeps threatening to drop the Ethiopian opal from Monday’s upcoming sale unless it arrives in time for a proper appraisal. “It’s about fucking winning,” Howard smiles, his bloody nose still raw from being punched. It’s a miracle that Howard merits any sympathy. Props to the Safdies for being shrewd enough to chase Sandler for the part. His two decades making bank at the box office as a loveable wiseass feels in hindsight like just a prelude to this career-topper, the juiciest role he may ever get. Uncut Gems is a stress-test for Sandler’s boundless charm, and boy does the film hold steady. Also doing serious MVP work: Darius Khondji’s radioactive cinematography and composer Daniel Lopatin’s synth-heavy dread. Over the past decade, the Safdies have devoted themselves to chronicling the exquisite rush of bare-knuckle survival. From Daddy Longlegs to Heaven Knows What to Good Time, they’ve followed deadbeat dads, junkies and petty bank robbers, infusing their travails with a sort of ravishing anxiety. Uncut Gems is a zenith look at a harrowing nadir. Despite what the title suggests, it’s more of an impeccably crafted diamond, with a multifaceted brilliance that only comes from a masterwork. Stephen Garrett is the former film editor of 'Time Out New York’ and has written about the movie industry for more than 20 years.

"Dec 13, 2019"," If you know New York, you know its beauty is entwined with its ugliness: The scaffolding that obscures the elegant storefront, the traffic cones that zigzag haphazardly along the pretty historic street, even the intricate cast latticework on the lowly manhole covers. A city that’s moving and changing every day can’t be conventionally shiny and alluring every minute, and if nothing else, Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems captures New York’s particular brand of dirty glamour. It’s big Pizza Rat energy in movie form. But is energy enough? Uncut Gems is terrifically effective as you’re watching it, though its aroma—unlike streetside garbage in the summer—might not linger. The Safdie brothers specialize in gritty yet vaguely romanticized sagas of the street; their last movie was the 2017 Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson as a small-time crook who tries to get his brother out of jail after a robbery gone wrong. Uncut Gems, an intricate odyssey that moves fast and takes hairpin turns, is a more ambitious picture, though perhaps not a better one. The Safdies are a little too enamored with the unvarnished New York cinema of the 1970s, and Uncut Gems often feels self-consciously retro; it’s a tourist in the world of movies like Mean Streets and The French Connection, hoping it’s packed the right clothes to blend in. (Martin Scorsese, incidentally, is one of the film’s producers.) There’s a gimmicky quality to Uncut Gems that you can sense even in its synth-heavy ’80s-style score (by Daniel Lopatin). It’s probably intended as ironically nostalgic, though it mostly comes off as some noodly thing your dad worked out on his new keyboard. And yet it’s hard to turn away from the performance at Uncut Gems’ center: Adam Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a diamond-district wheeler-dealer and compulsive gambler who’s racing the clock to pay off his mountainous debts. He thinks he’s finally solved his problem when a massive, bumpy rock arrives at his showroom: It’s a rare black opal, the product of a mine in Ethiopia, and he’s been waiting months for its arrival—it shows up inside a fish packed on ice, so you know right away there’s something not-quite-legit about it. Howard’s plan is to sell off the opal immediately to get a loan shark—played, with menacing oiliness, by Eric Bogosian—off his tail. He seems eager to get the whole business over with, yet there’s a new detour every minute. His behavior suggests that he can never stop pouring whatever money he has into bets that he’s sure will bring bigger and bigger payoffs. You can see why he needs the dough: He has a big house in Long Island, a few kids, and a blasé wife (Idina Menzel). Then there’s his comely mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), who’s also one of his showroom employees—she lives in the apartment Howard keeps in Manhattan, a sleek showplace with a primo stereo system and costly-tacky neon décor. Howard has got to unload that rock. But his plans are derailed when the Celtics’ Kevin Garnett (playing himself) turns up at the showroom to buy some bling and instead becomes obsessed with the opal, coming to believe it brings him luck on the court. Howard reluctantly lends it to him, and then has a devil of a time getting it back, even as the thugs who’ve lent him money breathe ever more hotly down his neck. Howard runs all over town and beyond, pawning a glitzy championship ring here and placing a high rollers’ bet there. The movie’s pace is dizzying—the city and its environs, as shot by cinematographer Darius Khondji, bobble past in a peripatetic whirl. The Safdies aren’t wholly lacking in wit: In one of the movie’s cleverest scenes, Howard, happy and horny after winning big (or thinking he has), arrives at the empty apartment and texts Julia to find out where she is. When she says she’s steps away, he tells her he’s en route himself, then hides in the closet to wait for her—he spies on her as she strips down to her luxe unmentionables, texting sweet, naughty nothings to her before popping out to surprise her. Sandler makes it all work, wheeling through the picture in a hurried, slumpy slouch, his worn-in leather jacket drooping off his shoulders. Howard favors bright or satiny shirts and changes them often; you never see him with wet armpits, but you can almost smell their dampness. Every few years or so critics and moviegoers trumpet the “discovery” that Sandler is a fine, serious actor, but there’s no longer a need to make the case. He was terrific in Noah Baumbach’s 2017 The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), and he’s the heartbeat of Uncut Gems. Sandler has perfected the art of talk-smiling through his teeth, barely moving his lips, and it’s perfect for Howard: He’s a guy who’s always hustling, because to stop would be a kind of death. He shows what he’s feeling by trying to hide what he’s feeling. He’s extreme, but he’s also for real. And his is the shtick you keep buying even when the movie around him tempts you with cheaper, shinier stuff.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," Chekhov’s gun is an overused trope. There are no hard-and-fast rules in writing: just because there’s a gun on the table in the first act of a story doesn’t mean it inevitably needs to be fired in the third act. But in Uncut Gems, writer-directors Josh and Benny Safdie push the concept to its limits, wringing every ounce of tension out of it. Uncut Gems is so chock-full of Chekhov’s guns, it could arm a small country. Aptly described as a “feature length panic attack,” Uncut Gems gets its anxiety from making the audience wait to see which gun will go off first. That titular uncut gem is a stone studded with rare black opals, which fast-talking, neurotic New York City jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) procured by legally questionable means from an Ethiopian mine. He hopes this latest score will be the answer to his numerous problems: He’s a gambling addict in debt to several loan sharks; he and his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) are separated, but they haven’t yet told their children; his shop-assistant-slash-girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) took drugs with The Weeknd in a club bathroom; a routine colonoscopy turned up a suspicious-looking nodule that needs a biopsy. Continuing the metaphor, every time one of those Chekhov’s guns is revealed to be loaded with blanks, Howard pulls another from his waistband and adds it to the pile. He allows Boston Celtics superstar Kevin Garnett (who is so good in this movie, it’ll be a crime if he doesn’t land a starring role soon) to borrow the opal for one game, even though Howard needs to present it to an auction house the next day for an upcoming sale. Then he pawns the NBA championship ring Garnett left him for collateral, and rather than delivering the money to his most aggressive lender, Arno (Eric Bogosian), he bets it all on Garnett and the Celtics. And that’s just one of the threads Howard unravels as he weaves a complicated web of broken promises and unnecessary risk. The Safdie brothers include just enough details — a broker chiding Howard for returning late to pick up his last pawned treasure, Dinah’s exasperation — to hint that this cycle will continue ad nauseam. Like a true addict, Howard doesn’t care about winning as much as he craves the adrenaline rush that comes with betting it all. That’s clear even before Sandler delivers a sweaty, gut-punching monologue admitting to the dynamic. Even as Howard screws himself over with blustery bravado, it’s hard not to root for him. It’s a testament to Sandler’s performance, categorically the best of his career, but also to the Safdies’ skill behind the camera. They use tight close-ups, quick cuts, overlapping lines of dialogue, and an electronic soundtrack, by turns buzzy and blaring, to create a sense of claustrophobia. It serves as a kind of extended cinematic anxiety attack, leaving the audience as overwhelmed as Howard. And yet the sheer stakes of his reckless gambles may push them to empathize with him even as he descends into mania. Howard is sleazy, constantly in peril, and at times downright pathetic. And yet he keeps moving forward, tenaciously and audaciously, outwardly living the life of a high-roller. He surrounds himself with diamond-encrusted Furbies, professional athletes, and Julia, who is unbelievably devoted to him. Yes, the audience is rooting for Howard, but they’ll vary in whether they’re rooting for him to get his shit together, set up a payment plan for his debts, and repair his relationship with his family, or to see him score big when he drops a quarter of a million dollars on the NBA Championship game. The Safdie brothers don’t seem interested in coming down on either side of that proposal. Uncut Gems shares much of its DNA with the morally ambiguous character pieces of the 1970s that Todd Phillips laments can’t get made these days. (King of the genre Martin Scorsese is an executive producer on this film.) The Safdies have made a career of them, though, most recently bringing out more of Robert Pattinson’s balls-to-the-wall weirdness in the similarly frenzied crime drama Good Time. The Safdie brothers told Deadline that they based Uncut Gems on stories their dad told them while growing up in Queens. There is an almost folkloric sense to the story, which reads both like a cautionary tale and a beta-male fantasy. Even though Uncut Gems shares the gritty realism of its predecessors, the Safdie brothers inject a tinge of otherworldly mysticism, just enough to complicate the idea that Howard is solely responsible for his misfortunes. His opal stone becomes a sort of spiritual McGuffin, a holy grail for hypebeasts. Kevin Garnett is so drawn to the opal that he practically begs Howard to sell it to him, believing it’s a good omen that will help him win the playoffs. Toward the beginning of Uncut Gems, the Safdies justify that irresistible allure with a truly breathtaking shot. The camera seems to freefall into the stone, immersing viewers in the gems’ iridescent colors and elegant structure. The score hums like a choir of angels. It’s heaven. Then the colors dull, the structures become squishier, and the camera transforms into a colonoscopy probe exploring Howard’s insides. The final shot of the film does it in reverse, making its way through Howard and back to the opalescent depths. It’s easy to imagine that the whole story takes place, The Grinch-snowflake-style, inside the gem itself, or else that the gem is inside Howard, compelling him forward.  Those last few moments of immersion are a welcome reprieve, a cool down after nearly two and a half hours of clenched fists as Howard unravels his life and then tries to stitch it back together. Spending 134 minutes with him is exhausting. It seems impossible that one man could live his life in this sort of chaos. But Howard is a gambler, addicted to the danger he creates. He can’t help but play Russian roulette with his life, spinning the barrel of Chekhov’s gun faster and faster as he chases that jolt of adrenaline when he pulls the trigger. The Safdie brothers play with that pattern of tension and relief, setting up overlapping calamities like they’re adding bullets to the chamber. And yet when the gun finally goes off, it’s still surprising to everyone — even to Howard himself. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," By  Kevin Nguyen, a features editor at The Verge, where he publishes award-winning stories about labor, business, and policing. Previously, he was a senior editor at GQ. If thrillers tend to follow a narrative arc that looks like a curve, the Safdie brothers prefer one shaped like a coil. Their excellent new film, Uncut Gems, is an unnerving story of spiraling bad decisions and escalating violence. It’s also equal parts about gambling, Judaism, and Adam Sandler’s goatee. The stakes are set from the movie’s opening scene where a mining accident in Ethiopia (complete with a flash of exposed shin bone) enables two thieves to sneak out a rare opal that will end up in the hands of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a New York jeweler with a penchant for ostentatious ice. Need a jeweled Furby? See Ratner. Like any tragic New Yorker, Ratner is a Knicks fan. But when Celtics center Kevin Garnett rolls through his shop, Ratner realizes his higher calling isn’t fandom but a love of winning. Ratner is in all kinds of debt that he squirrels out of by borrowing more, constantly over-leveraging himself, and torching bridges. If you’re a hyper-cautious, keeps-their-spending-budget-in-a-spreadsheet viewer like me, the whole experience will make you deeply uneasy. But Ratner — through Sandler’s charming sneer and dirtbag facial hair — never loses hope that he can beat the house. If there’s a central idea to Uncut Gems, it’s that the heart of gambling addiction isn’t greed, but the elation of winning — and every insatiable feeling that follows. Success is always within reach, if just one thing would turn out right. Each bad bet can be erased by a slightly bigger bet, this one finally the sure thing.  In this way, Uncut Gems closely resembles the Safdies’ last movie Good Time. (It’s streaming on a number of platforms, including Amazon Prime Video, if you’ve missed it.) There are the obvious visual similarities. The Safdies coat Gems in indulgent swirls of ‘80s pastiche. The effect is less nostalgic and more of dread, as the low drone of synthesizers creeps into each scene. Where Good Time had an electric Robert Pattinson at the center of it, Gems hinges entirely on Adam Sandler. And it’s hard to say enough good things about him here. His performance is likely to be compared to his last great prestige outing in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch Drunk Love. But that was a full-bodied role, with an angry, confused machismo at the center of it. Uncut Gems asks something entirely different of Sandler; it’s a role that’s not necessarily more subtle but more calculated. The Safdies often keep the camera tight on its actors’ faces, confronting the viewer with blemished skin and nervous flop sweat. Sandler is maybe most impressive here, with his control of small facial tics and a conniving smirk that peeks out in every deranged conversation he has. He’s often detestable yet deeply sympathetic. Sure, there’s a lot to make of Sandler’s dramatic turn here, but he’s a comedian who has made a career playing man-children. Ratner isn’t Billy Madison, but he’s not not Billy Madison. Everyone else in the movie is basically furniture for Sandler to bump into. Still, the cast is loads of fun. Garnett is a parody of himself, as is The Weeknd, doing his whole horny crooner thing. An underused Lakeith Stanfield brings his anxious energy. Mike Francesa plays Ratner’s bookie, though he might as well be playing himself, the way he barks about sports. For all its posturing and crafty filmmaking, Uncut Gems is just a movie that’s very much itself. Sure, Uncut Gems feels like New York by way of John Cassavetes and Robert Altman, but it’s the product of the Safdies’ self-assured vision. There are also quieter, personal touches amid the chaos. In particular, a Passover seder precedes one of the movie’s sadder, more desperate moments. Still, there’s a kind of empty, nihilist morality at the heart of the Safdies’ films — or maybe not really one at all — and Uncut Gems won’t really leave you asking any questions other than deciding whether Ratner is chaotic good or chaotic evil. But these ideas are hardly the point. Uncut Gems is about the thrill of the gambit, the jolt of glee and terror in watching someone pursue the next shiny thing.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," Like The Wrestler, Darren Aronofsky's descent into the grubby world of provincial grappling matches, Uncut Gems takes us into a rarely examined social arena—the Diamond District of Midtown Manhattan, here portrayed as a place of frenzy and menace. The directors, Josh and Benny Safdie, who wrote and edited the film with Ronald Bronstein, have created a vivid simulation of what it might be like to live inside a pinball machine, and they've given Adam Sandler his showiest role, which he embraces with obvious appreciation. The year is 2012, and Sandler's Howard Ratner is a yappy gem dealer whose wares are especially prized by black athletes and other bling aficionados. Howard is also a far-gone gambling addict (basketball is his jones), whose life is one long desperate hustle conducted in a clamor of shouts and lies and nerve-stripping security buzzers. After much long-distance maneuvering, Howard has taken delivery of a big opal smuggled out of an Ethiopian mine. He is already deep in debt to various bookies and pawnbrokers, and he believes, with the unwarranted optimism of the perpetually deluded, that this chunk of glimmering stone will finally bail him out. Time is tight, though—there's a pair of debt-collecting thugs on his case, and they never had a lot of patience to run out of in the first place. (One of these two bruisers is played by Keith Williams Richards, a non-actor recruited from real life, whose smoldering hostility is very scary). The movie is an exercise in endless tension. Howard stupidly loans out his opal to basketball star Kevin Garnett (the man himself), who gives him a pricey championship ring as security. Howard promises to hold the ring, but then immediately pawns it and hands over the resulting cash to his bookie (longtime New York sportscaster Mike Francesa) to lay down on an imminent Lakers game. Things continue not going well. There's a violent confrontation at a snooty auction house and a nerve-wracking side trip to the Mohegan Sun casino in faraway Connecticut, with a cute sexting scene thrown in for human interest. As they demonstrated in their last film, the similarly breathless Good Time, with Robert Pattinson, the Safdie brothers have a rare gift for conveying the raw textures of life-at-the-bottom. Can Sandler's rap-a-holic Howard pull his life together somehow? He would surely bet on it—but then he'd bet on anything. Considering the evidence, we're inclined to be more circumspect. Bombshell addresses the still-hot topic of sexual harassment in the media business, focusing on the fall of the late Fox News chief Roger Ailes, who was taken down by a group of Fox women who'd grown tired of muffling their fury about his unsavory come-ons and creepy innuendoes. The behavior we see taking place here seems primordial (although women may find it right up-to-date). Discussing a new female employee's desire to become on-air talent, Ailes (John Lithgow in a fat suit) tells her to ""stand up and give me a twirl,"" and then asks her to hike up her skirt a bit. (""It's a visual medium."") But Ailes isn't the only sexual primitive on the network's premises—we watch another woman smiling helplessly through her exasperation as a male colleague, commenting on some random footage, says, ""Tell me those lips haven't sucked cock."" At the center of the movie is a splendidly steely performance by Charlize Theron, who completely nails the character of Fox News star Megyn Kelly, a definitive tough cookie. After moderating a 2015 GOP presidential debate in which she gave candidate Donald Trump no quarter, Kelly is only moderately appalled to hear Trump on CNN saying, ""You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her—wherever."" (""Did he just accuse me of anger-menstruating?"" Theron's Kelly wonders.) Bombshell might have been a better movie if it were a full-on Megyn Kelly biopic—with her ambiguous relationship to Ailes, she's a richly complex character. But the real star of this story—if not the movie that's been made from it—is Gretchen Carlson (Nicole Kidman), a onetime Fox star who's now on her way out. Carlson has been talking to other Fox women about their repulsive experiences with Ailes, and now, armed with their stories, she's filing a crafty lawsuit against the celebrated news titan that will eventually drive him out of the business. There isn't a lot more to Kidman's character than this, though, so every time the movie cuts away to her from Theron's Kelly it feels a little like a distraction. In a similarly awkward position is Margot Robbie, who plays a sweet composite character named Kayla, whose purpose is to help demonstrate how Ailes's sleazy flirtations work. (She's the ""give me a twirl"" girl.) Possibly just as important to director Jay Roach (Game Change), however, would be her function as a purveyor of the Hollywood view of Fox News. Early on, we see Kayla—a conservative Christian—getting the welcome-aboard lowdown from a staff producer named Jess (Kate McKinnon). In the Fox worldview, Jess tells Kayla, ""People are lazy morons, minorities are criminals, sex is sick but interesting."" Start your day with Reason.

"Dec 13, 2019"," You are now leaving AARP.org and going to a website that is not operated by AARP. A different privacy policy and terms of service will apply. I never understood why anyone thought Adam Sandler, 53, was so funny that viewers spent $4 billion to see his comedies. That nasal fake-child voice is excruciatingly grating. But as a dramatic actor, he's been good for years, and he's never been as impressive as he is as the New York jeweler, gambler, dreamer and self-defeating buffoon Howard Ratner in Uncut Gems. His office is so crummy the door keeps getting stuck, which comes in handy when angry mob types visit to inquire about Howard's ever-proliferating debts and find themselves trapped behind the glass, shouting threats. Howard has more than mobsters to fret about. His wife (Idina Menzel, 48) calls him “the most annoying person I have ever met. I hate being with you, I hate looking at you, and if I had my way, I would never see you again.” She has a point, though for some reason Howard's dishy mistress (Julia Fox) loves him anyhow — not that she'll pass up the flattering opportunity to get pawed behind closed doors by the rap star The Weeknd, provoking Howard's hypocritical jealousy. Still, appallingly sleazy as he is, Howard is a fool who has his charms. Even his annoying, keening voice is redeemed by his clueless kindliness — and in the context of a character we care about, it's funnier than ever. Howard's heart is as sweet as his mind is unwisely imaginative, and his ambition is quenchless. When he loses a sports bet, does he give up? No! He pawns something someone loaned him and makes another bet to cover it. Then another to cover that, robbing Peter (and as many others as necessary) to pay Paul. What's going to save all his bets is one big grand slam. Because he's gotten hold of a magic rock, a big chunk hewn from a mine in Ethiopia that glitters with opals. In a dazzling opening scene, we visit the mine, then plunge Fantastic Voyage-style deep into the gem's mysterious interior. Then there's a dazzling cut to another passageway — which turns out to be the video of Howard's colonoscopy. It's a sardonic metaphor for where his glittering vision of a million-dollar score might well lead him, and also a fine example of the film's clever, frenetic cinematography. The whole movie feels like the last part of Goodfellas, when the hero is on a cocaine bender and the camera gets a contact high. Howard's drug of choice is the greed unleashed by that giant uncut gem he got through shady connections and plans to sell at a hoity-toity auction house. But his acquaintance Kevin Garnett, the pro basketball player (played effortlessly well by the real Garnett), also has passionate feelings for the gemstone in question, and tries to buy it for big bucks before the auction. He needs it for luck on the court. Howard won't sell it for less than his wild-eyed hopes, but he's crazy enough to let Garnett borrow it for a few days, which puts him under pressure from the auctioneers. And as if that weren't enough, his sinister brother-in-law (the brilliant Eric Bogosian, 66) is demanding the money Howard owes him, right now — though he, too, seems wowed by Howard's astounding boldness in reaching for his dream. Besides, Howard tries to be the best family man he can. He dutifully attends his daughter's school play. When he spots a couple of criminals in the audience who may want him dead and he has to flee, is that Howard's fault? If Preston Sturges, master of rapid-fire comic dialogue, had written Abel Ferrara's gritty Bad Lieutenant while cribbing from Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets, it wouldn't be any better than this irresistible crime caper flick. And if Sandler doesn't land an Oscar nomination for this, he was robbed.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," When you think of Adam Sandler, you think about Saturday Night Live, screwball comedies (like my personal favorite Big Daddy) or voicing the animation patriarch Dracula in the Hotel Transylvania franchise.  Right??!!  Well, there is no joking around when it comes to Adam’s star turn in Uncut Gems. As charismatic New York City jeweler, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is always on the lookout for the next big score while making a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. This precarious high-wire act in the form of balancing business, family, and dodging adversaries on all sides in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win creates irreversible results. When I tell you this is the craziest, most stressful film I have seen to date, I do not exaggerate. A massage was in dire need for sure.  Why?  Watching a character crash and burn at his own peril while making one bad decision after another is just sheer pain.  You know the person that buys a lottery ticket every day, goes to the racetrack and plays craps with the unwavering belief that with every dime they own (and sometimes other people’s dimes) are going to hit it big enough to gross more money than one could ever imagine changing their life?  Of course you do and you also know that those types of stories never have a happy ending. Adam Sandler’s performance is unparalleled.  It’s grounded, nuanced and encompasses all of his quirks and idiosyncrasies to his advantage.  Enhancing his performance is Idina Menzel, the legendary Tony winner and voice of Elsa in the Frozen franchise.  Her performance as his fed up wife Julia is simply stunning, with just the right amount of acerbic sarcasm blended with masked empathy that makes Menzel very interesting to watch. Writers and directors Benny and Josh Safdie create a world within the nooks and crannies of New York City that are laden with intrigue, drama and. unsavory shenanigans.  The final 15 minutes will blown your top off. Uncut Gems, centers around a rare jewel believed to have special agenting power, creates a dramatic roller-coaster ride infused with professional ball players, schemers and a man with a dream gone terribly left.  You’re gonna love it! Produced by A24, Uncut Gems drops in limited release on December 13 and nationwide on  Christmas Day.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," Howard Ratner, the antihero of Uncut Gems played by Adam Sandler, is always standing on the outside of his own life, yelling to get into the VIP room, and never appreciating where he is. In his most memorable role since Spanglish (2004), Sandler creates a shambling, awkward, tacky, middle-aged mess of a man. Howard is a successful jeweler in New York’s Diamond District. He drives a late-model Mercedes, owns a condo in Manhattan and a house outside of the city, and he covers himself in Gucci. And yet, Howard almost never experiences happiness because he’s so entangled in his obsessive pursuit of it. Everyone around the man is either irritated with him or embarrassed by him, including his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), his daughter, and his employee Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who serves as a conduit between Howard and the cool black celebrities who will spend money in his shop, but otherwise would never be seen with the man. From left to right: Basketball star Kevin Garnett, LaKeith Stanfield, and Adam Sandler in a scene from Uncut Gems. Though he’s playing himself, Garnett is given a few challenges in the movie. But no one is more disgusted with Howard than Arno (Eric Bogosian), his brother-in-law, who has been financing Howard’s gambling habit to the tune of $100,000. Arno wants his money, and Howard has made yet another bet: that a rare opal extracted from a mine in Ethiopia will deliver a million-dollar windfall. Under the direction of Josh and Benny Safdie (whose father worked in the Diamond District) we fall directly from the mine that has claimed an unfortunate worker’s foot, through the gem, and directly into Howard’s colon. That’s about the only rest a viewer will get for the remaining two hours and 10 minutes of the film, a bumpy, nail-biting, sweaty-palmed, heart-in-your-stomach ride through Howard’s life, the sort that makes you think, at multiple junctures, how can any man live like this? Forget about the possibility of colon cancer — the biggest threat to Howard’s life is himself. He’s overdue for a coronary, and by the end of the film you’re left wondering whether you should see a doctor and demand an EKG for yourself. Sheesh. Howard’s life seemingly takes a turn for the better when Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett comes into his shop, which, as usual, is in chaos thanks to a shakedown visit from Arno and two of his heavies. Garnett, in the middle of a playoff run, becomes enchanted with the uncut Ethiopian rock that a fawning Howard presents to him. Howard allows Garnett to borrow it, even though he’s already promised it to an auction house. As collateral, Garnett leaves his 2008 championship ring, which Howard turns around and pawns in order to make a bet on the game Garnett’s playing that night. Though he’s playing himself, Garnett is given a few challenges, especially in a scene that features just him and Sandler. In a recent media roundtable, Garnett shared a bit of the theater within pro basketball by revealing that his Celtics coach, Doc Rivers, would regularly morph from coach into director. Rivers, Garnett said, would insist on conducting rehearsals of how Garnett would exit huddles when he called a play. The star’s posture and facial expressions were just as important as ball-handling or nailing shots, apparently. Rivers was an on-court architect of psychological warfare, and Garnett was his chief warrior. It turned out to be serendipitous training for Garnett’s work with the Safdies, a couple of rough-and-tumble gonzos whose films are marked by a disturbing degree of reality. Garnett’s casting comes across as a bit of genius. He moves through the chaos of Howard’s life with a natural placidity, even when he’s clearly exasperated with the jeweler. But then, Garnett has something Howard lacks in life: a concrete goal. He wants another NBA title. Howard, on the other hand, flits from crisis to crisis, always looking for the next thing that will offer some momentary fulfillment and keep Arno off his back. He can’t resist hurriedly bulldozing through everything, even Passover. Production designer Sam Lisenco makes Uncut Gems an ugly film, but deliberately so. It’s about a man with a gambling addiction who leads a small, ugly life peddling shiny rocks for a living. Howard’s world is gaudy, gimmicky and dark. The New York pied-à-terre where he keeps his mistress seems to have been decorated entirely from a Sharper Image catalog. The magic trick of the Safdies is that even when they plunge you into the dyspeptic, spleeny, cyclical hell of Howard’s own making, they manage to make you root for him anyway. Howard’s made a wobbly chariot out of betting slips and a tenuous relationship with the star of a team he doesn’t even like, and yet here we are, praying that the wheels don’t fall off.

"Dec 13, 2019"," Most people would never buy a thing from Howard (Adam Sandler), the motor-mouthed star and scourge of the Safdie brothers’ Uncut Gems. But then he isn’t interested in most people. 
A jeweler whose primary line appears to be selling gem-encrusted gee-gaws to rappers and athletes, he deals primarily in myth-making when not indulging in mischief. He has a good line of gab, Howard, but what he does best is what every true operator understands: Just keep talking, never stop moving, and keep those plates spinning.
Uncut Gems is an exhausting movie about an exhausting character, shot through with an intoxicating restless relentlessness powered in large part by Sandler’s ferociously hungry performance.
 
Howard works in the Diamond District, that anachronistic tangle of rattletrap offices and storefronts in midtown Manhattan. Unlike many of the sleekly minimal financial offices stacked in the high rises towering overhead, through which transactions blitz at the speed of light, in the District the decor doesn’t appear to have been updated since 1972 and the haggling marketplace vibe is timeless.
 
Since the gems being traded are not items of intrinsic value, being for the most part just pretty stones, the transactions are in large part about storytelling: The ones being spun by the dealers and the fantasies spinning in the customers’ heads. When
Uncut Gems kicks in, Howard is in the process of telling a story, and it’s a whopper.
 He has just taken receipt of a lumpy and rare stone, studded with colored gems, shipped over from the darkness of an Ethiopian mine whose timeless heave and hustle opens the movie. Like any good dealer, Howard already has a buyer lined up, the guy who just walked into his shop: Boston Celtics forward Kevin Garnett. Towering over his entourage in Howard’s cramped showroom, Garnett seems at first looking maybe to blow pro athlete money on something shiny. But he’s not particularly interested in anything. That is until Howard, whose inside man in the entourage Demany (LaKeith Stanfield, edgy and watchful) has hooked Garnett into coming, starts telling Garnett the story of the rock. Quieting down for a keenly observed few moments of hushed intensity, Howard spins a tale of seeming honesty about a documentary he saw about the plight of black Ethiopian Jews making poverty wages working in the mines and how that lead him to the rock. Once Garnett’s eyes hit upon the rock itself, it’s as though his soul is on fire. The Celtics are powering their way into the 2012 NBA finals and Garnett—alert as many athletes are to signs and portents—is looking for that charm that can help put him over the top. Only in Howard’s world, nothing is that simple. From that moment of deft salesmanship, in which Howard uses the rock’s origin story to suggest a subtle linkage between his Jewishness and Garnett’s African heritage, Uncut Gems spins into a kaleidoscopic frenzy of greed, paranoia, grandiosity, and steadily encroaching violence. Howard’s ever-buzzing brain will not let him make one deal when he can launch four-and-a-half linked side hustles with fifteen broken promises between them. This is the kind of hyperkinetic bustle that the Safdies specialize in. Because of Howard’s inability to follow a line from A to B without pitching a deal to C through G along the way, selling Garnett the rock ultimately involves Howard placing ludicrously specific bets with a bookie, sports radio phenom Mike Francesca, working a jagged seam of patter and bringing some Long Island verisimilitude to the movie. He gets his father-in-law (Judd Hirsch) to pretend to be bidding for the rock at an auction house that Howard already promised it to. He pawns Garnett’s jewel-encrusted Celtics ring, and trying to avoid the dead-eyed mooks accompanying his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian), whom Howard just might owe many thousands of dollars he has no intention of ever paying back. At the same time, Howard has to make sure that neither his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) or girlfriend/assistant Julia (Julia Fox) walk out on him. Through all this turmoil, he still manages to get along with everybody at the blowout Passover dinner that serves as a brief cease fire amidst Howard’s deal-cutting and excuse-making.  The hurly-burly that the Safdies cook up for Uncut Gems is not unlike the tripped-out night journey that they blasted Robert Pattinson through for 2017’s scuzzball noir, Good Time. Rather than the far ends of the boroughs, though, this time they put their star through his paces in the claustrophobic clamor of Midtown, where lusciously decadent nightclub scenes jut up against daytime workaday commerce. Shot by Darius Khondji with a gritty and grainy filter, the movie’s look both highlights the tension inherent in all the story’s intense face-offs and paints it all with a curiously sweaty glamour. In some ways, this is Treasure of the Sierra Madre in the big city, with glory, riches, and survival driving everyone over the edge as it bounds and scurries from one tightly-stitched and explosive set piece to the next. As an actor, Sandler often tends to volley from quiet irony to blow-out mania without much of an in-between. In this role, however, he underlays Howard’s slick salesman patter and backslapping camaraderie with a not-so-well-hidden layer of mania. Although Howard regularly bursts out into panic, either faked in order to get out of a jam or sincere when he thinks he’s about to lose out, it’s less Sandler flipping a switch than his dialing up the frantic hunger and terror that’s always there. While an excellent piece of acting, easily the best of his career, it curiously looks best when paired with the loose and eager-eyed Garnett, who plays himself with a winking ease that is far more skillful than it may appear. A masterful, damn-the-torpedos screw-tightener from a bold pair of American filmmakers, Uncut Gems could either be a portent of great things to come or the best they have to offer us.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," It’s obvious that Sandler, the actor, is capable of extraordinary range — not in the traditional, Meryl Streep sense, but a range of incredibly good (“Punch-Drunk Love”) to painfully bad (the horrendous “Jack and Jill”) and incredibly good again, as in “Uncut Gems,” a frenetic, compulsively watchable, exhausting and exhilarating collaboration with Josh and Benny Safdie. What’s less discussed, perhaps, is what links these performances. In all these films, Sandler presents the predicament of a man-child, someone who has aged physically and perhaps intellectually but not emotionally. How does such a man get through life, and what about the people who have to live with him? Can he survive, and can they? In his best performances, Sandler offers a dark, bruising exploration of this state of being that actually tells us something.  “Uncut Gems” declares itself right away with an extraordinary opening credits sequence, taking us from the claustrophobic tunnels of a mine in Ethiopia, where precious gems emerge from volcanic ash, to the similarly claustrophobic Diamond District in Manhattan, where such gems gleam in glass cases in a warren of small shops, one belonging to jeweler and gambling addict Howard Ratner (Sandler).  It also takes us, in one mesmerizing shot, from the insides of a rare black opal, with its brilliant hues and psychedelic imagery, to the slippery insides of a human colon — yes, we’re witnessing Howard’s colonoscopy! If the secret to a man’s heart is through his stomach, the secret to his psyche may be through his colon, the Safdies seem to be saying. In film theory, this could be a first.  The year is 2012. Kevin Garnett is still playing for the Boston Celtics and The Weeknd is a relative newcomer to the music scene. Both men play fictionalized versions of themselves here, Garnett in an especially pivotal role. One day, Garnett pays a visit to Howard’s shop, ushered in by one of Howard’s unofficial collaborators, a hustler (Lakeith Stanfield) who gets a cut of the action. Just like its owner, the shop itself seems in constant noisy flux, always on the brink of catastrophe. The buzzer system never seems to work, and this takes on increasing significance; visitors can become trapped in the tiny enclosed foyer leading to the outside. The basketball connection is also significant; Howard is addicted to the sport and also, unfortunately, to betting on it.  We soon learn Howard’s fatal flaw: Presented with a choice, he’ll always make the wrong one, the one he thinks may lead to a big break, but that everyone else knows will take him further down the path to destruction.  And so on this day, when Howard’s beloved black opal arrives in the mail from Ethiopia, smuggled in the belly of a giant fish, he can’t resist showing it off to Garnett. The Celtics star decides he needs the gem for luck in his Eastern Conference playoff game that night (real game footage plays a key role in the movie). He asks Howard to lend it to him, leaving his NBA ring as collateral. In two bad decisions, Howard says yes, then pawns the ring.  A frantic chase ensues to recover the gem, so Howard can bring it to auction, where he hopes to make a cool million and solve all his financial problems. Meanwhile, some nasty loan collectors are chasing him down with increasing, shall we say, irritability. Howard’s personal life is no less precarious; he’s trying to hold onto the last vestiges of his collapsing marriage, while supporting his young girlfriend on the sly in a midtown apartment. Not to divulge any key plot details, but let’s just mention that never has there been a cinematic take on the suburban school play — a familiar scenario in rom-coms (will Daddy show up in time?) — that involves more mayhem than this one. Don’t believe us? How often does Daddy end up stripped naked and locked in a car trunk in the school parking lot?  There’s great work here by celebrated cinematographer Darius Khondji, whose camera never seems to stop moving for more than a split second, and by a terrific supporting cast that includes Stanfield, Garnett, Idina Menzel as Howard’s long-suffering wife (compelling in the rare role that doesn’t make use of her famous singing voice) and charismatic newcomer Julia Fox as Howard’s inexplicably loyal girlfriend. As for Sandler, he deserves the accolades he’s getting, again proving that with the right material, he has an uncanny ability to reach deep within us, despite our deep, DEEP annoyance. “You’re just about the most annoying person I’ve ever met,” his wife says at one point, virtually seething — but making it clear that she cares, still, and perhaps forever. So do we, and that’s why it all works.  “Uncut Gems,” an A24 release, has been rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America “for pervasive strong language, violence, some sexual content and brief drug use.” Running time: 135 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," There are many outstanding qualities to the new film Uncut Gems. It’s a vivid character study that stars Adam Sandler in his best screen performance to date. The dialogue, written by its directors, Benny Safdie and Josh Safdie, along with Ronald Bronstein, has a blunt and profane New York City honesty to it – the kind of patter rarely heard on the big or small screen these days. The film’s camera work and editing are some of the best of the year, drawing you in with its kinetic energy. The film also pins you to your seat with tension that most thrillers and horror movies would be lucky to claim. It’s a tumultuous filmgoing experience, one that throttles you and utterly wrings you out. What makes it so tumultuous? For starters, the story’s lead character is living a life of utter chaos. It’s difficult to like someone as irritating, loud, immature, and aggressive as Howard Ratner (Sandler), but he’s our protagonist. He’s also one of the most self-destructive characters at the core of a film in quite some time and it asks a lot of us to invest in his ruinous shenanigans. You might have to go back to 2008 when Mickey Rourke played Randy “The Ram” Robinson in The Wrestler to find a lead character as demonstrably pathetic. At least Rourke’s pugilist was just trying to pay rent and put food on his table, but Sandler’s Ratner lives a tony life and should have it made. He makes an extraordinarily good living as a New York City jeweler who caters to an elite clientele of upscale Manhattanites and celebrities. Unfortunately, Ratner’s unable to count his blessings so the man desperately chases more and more pleasures. He cheats on his wife, is a gambling addict, and gets off rubbing shoulders with punks and gangsters. Every moment of his life is a frenzied mix of buying, selling, worrying, deceiving, and working overtime to keep from being flattened by a host of enemies. It’s hard to care about someone who endangers everyone in his orbit too, but that’s what Ratner does. And throughout this R-rated, two-hour and 15-minute film, we must watch Ratner risk his business time and time again, not to mention the lives of his family, his employees, and himself. Ratner makes horrible, disastrous choices at every turn. He’s a first-class schmuck, and that’s being kind. His main loan shark Arno (Eric Bogosian) who comes-a-calling is a relative, but that doesn’t prevent him from having his goons Phi (Keith Williams Richards) and Nico (Tommy Kominik) rough Ratner up. (The film’s poster highlights his busted, bloodied nose, courtesy of those two thugs.) Equally rough is Ratner’s relationship with his unforgiving, ex-wife Dinah. Played by Idina Menzel (Frozen), she’s a high-strung character unwilling to let anything go. She finds her former husband’s tendency to sleep with his employees especially egregious, and indeed, Ratner is currently mixing business and pleasure with Julia (Julia Fox), a comely sales clerk in his shop. Ratner runs from one problem to the next like a whirling dervish, running a gamut of emotions along the way, and he foolishly thinks he can clear up all his problems with the sale of a new item he’s just bought. It’s a chunk of rock from Africa, chock full of rainbow-colored opals. He believes in their supposed spiritual powers too and is more than happy to show it off to his untrustworthy colleagues and customers. Particularly smitten is Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett, playing himself, a potential buyer who believes the stones could be a good luck charm that will help him achieve victory in the NBA finals. Because he’s such a star f**ker, Ratner allows Garnett to “borrow” the rock for the championship. So Ratner lets his investment walk right out of the store, giving him one more thing to worry about. Of course, the gems help Garnett win, making him all the more hesitant to return it. Even Ratner’s go-between Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) doesn’t do his part to secure his boss’ investment. His underling is too busy hobnobbing with the Celtic’s entourage to do his job. In Ratner’s world, everyone gets caught up in the glitter. The Safdie brothers skate on thin ice throughout their film, asking us to cheer for such a man-child like Ratner. They ask us to care for a fool who makes one dunderheaded decision after another, but that’s where their genius in casting Sandler comes in. The veteran comic knows just how to make all of his character’s awfulness play as quite funny, and we can’t help but root for him when he’s tickling our funnybone. It’s one of the year’s best performances as Sander makes all of Ratner’s crazy immaturity into something almost lovable. Almost. Perhaps he’s an uncut gem himself, but as Ratner’s schemes bring more peril, the story changes from an edgy comedy into a terrifying thriller. The last 15 minutes of the film will have you sweating as much as Ratner does while he tries to pull off his biggest bet yet. It’s a harrowing scene, but one that gives the film an unforgettable and just ending. Uncut Gems is a fascinating character study, one that challenges the resolve of an audience’s empathy. It may confound and even anger some viewers, but the Safdie brothers know what they’re doing. They want their gripping story to put us between a rock and a hard place and make us squirm, just like their protagonist. And like a sure thing, that bet pays off in spades.

"Dec 13, 2019","An effervescent tale of self-destructing behavior, anchored by Sandler's intense performance. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," In recent years, director duo Josh and Benny Safdie are cornering a market all their own of thriller of toxic neons and fatal consequence, after the deeply grim exploits of Heaven Knows What and Good Time. Nobody makes films quite in the way that the Safdies are making them right now, even if their particular brand of originality swims in back alley, off-putting aggressiveness. This round, their Uncut Gems is a dose of high anxiety filmmaking that’s partly Shakespearean tragedy of hubris and part underbelly crime saga in another unexamined pocket of New York City life. Their best and most subversively accessible, it’s something enervating, infuriating, and compulsively watchable, all centered on a complex protagonist that also embodies all of the film’s contradictory qualities. That man is diamond dealer Howard Ratner, arrogantly betting off his assets and dwindling goodwill in the hopes of one massive payout, brought to exhilarating life by a possessed Adam Sandler. Howard’s life is a revolving door of characters to keep pace with, as he struggles to maneuver around them to avoid various debts and accepting personal responsibilities. There’s his associate Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) that brings him clientele and pushes a cache of fake watches. At home, his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) is well past fed up, but he keep begging for her stick around - along with his girlfriend Julia (spectacular newcomer Julia Fox). Plus debts come due with Howard’s brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian) and his crew of tough guys, and with an increasing threat of violence. But the delicate balance shatters with the arrival of a raw Ethiopian opal that slips into the superstitious hands of NBA star Kevin Garnett (yes, played by the actual Garnett). The breakneck insanity of the Safdies’ creation here makes for a grand guignol farce, eliciting laughs from the film’s demonic wit and out of shear necessity of catharsis from its constantly oppressive tension. Your mileage may vary on how much the film’s panic-attack pacing equates with an entertaining ride or an insufferable one, and moments of the film prove the filmmakers can’t sustain their vice-like grasp over its sprawling two-plus hours. Yet the filmmaking progression is difficult to deny. This time the Safdies are more fateful storytellers than fatalistic, rending a story (co-scripted between the Safdies and Ronald Bronstein) that’s as archetypally timeless as it is formally of the moment. If the broader plot points are largely uninspiring, their narrative point of view at least distracts from that. There’s an audacity of style that surprisingly enhances the story’s classicism rather than burying it, assaulting the senses with the weight of Howard’s monumentally bad decision making. A cacophonous soundscape is aided by a subterranean original score by Daniel Lopatin that’s sickly immersive, making the film as much of a torture device as it is an idiosyncratic spectacle. There’s also the alluring and devious work of cinematographer Darius Khondji, capturing everything that’s both distancing and captivating about this world within a gorgeous-gross palette, always undercut with a sense of danger in the frame. What Uncut Gems serves audiences, aside from its sturm and drang, is the strangest cinematic ecstasy they will find this year. But the highest elevation to the film’s effect comes from the career-best work from Sandler. The kind of beleaguered vulnerability that has defined his other performances in auteur films has gone curdled here, offering up a role that fits the actor like a glove while turning his typical persona on its head. The Safdies’ refine the specific cocktail of Sandlerisms into the molotov variety, coiling his oft-present explosive id into someone fundamentally reckless but fascinating to watch. He’s on a tear here, a depressed court jester from the gallows bent on hilarious evasiveness and oddball complexity. His Howard is a completely realized, believable person no matter how unhinged, egotistical, or dimly risk-taking - all thanks to Sandler digging as deeply internal as he ever has before. Has the director duo’s efforts progressed beyond rubbing our faces in grimness with joyless masculine observance? While this film does delight wholeheartedly in its protagonist’s downfall, its alliance does appear to fall with the fed-up wisdom of its female characters, with both Menzel and Fox giving incredibly funny and propulsive performances themselves. Uncut Gems is entirely a hell of Howard’s making, and a haunted funhouse of the Safdie’s doing, but this time they appear interested in something human. Even if its our grander, more timeless faults and fatal shortcomings. Saw it last night. And it was definitely better than I expected. I was very hesitant to see it, but the awards buzz and me liking GOOD TIMES made me realize I should AT LEAST just see this and make up my own mind. The Safdie's directorial style is certainly not for everyone and I wish the beginning was just slightly more efficient (the movie could've used one less tangent and certainly didn't need to be over 2 hours long). But perhaps we needed to meander in this world for the very strong final third act to work. That part really worked for me. I like reading positive reviews of movies I loathed, this was a great read even though I disagree. Idina Menzel was 100% the best part of it for me. The scene where she tells Adam Sandler he's annoying... I felt that in my soul. I’m not sure I’ll revisit it because I found Howard so relentlessly loathsome but I certainly got swept along for the ride. The third act is incredible cinema. The first film to make me care about basketball...ever?  Obviously all the talk is about Sandler but this has to be one of the most perfectly cast ensembles of the year. Eric Bogosian! Judd Hirsch! And I would happily pay to see another 2 hour movie following Julia or Idina’s Real Housewife of Long Island. You put perfectly my issue with the Safdie Bros film. Theres this meandering chaos that they occasionally lose control over. But Adam was great, and Idina Menzel was also great, not sure where her buzz is.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," From Ethiopia, With Gems: The latest film from NYC indie phenoms Josh and Benny Safdie opens with an unlikely sequence set in northern Ethiopia. We see an injured miner with an excruciating leg break being carried by his fellow workers, and then follow two laborers as they slip away to the mine to chip at whatever treasure lies in the midst of all the chaos. The prologue recalls William Friedkin’s The Exorcist, a movie that similarly (and ominously) opens in a foreign land before transporting the viewer to America. Granted, Uncut Gems is not be a horror movie in the traditional sense, but it is a harrowing, intense watch, one that rivals the best of the genre in the amount of sheer nerve-shattering tension it exudes. Anyways, back to the movie: What those two miners find is a huge gem, and as they hold it up in all its glory for the audience, the camera moves closer and closer until we actually delve within, traveling through the opal until all we see are cosmic particles floating in the abyss. As the score hypnotically swells, the camera continues gliding until we reach more familiar sights, and ultimately emerge from the asshole of jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) circa 2012. Mind you, this invasive medical procedure is about as good it as gets for the guy, who’s about to experience a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad couple of days. Any worries about his colon will soon take backseat to more urgent matters. This transfixing opening, whether you know it or not upon first viewing, cleverly sets the stage for the entire trajectory of the film. The visual effects that transport us from the gem to Howard’s innards highlight the promise of the eponymous stone buried deep within him. It’s not exactly the most subtle metaphor, but it’s an important one that will guide how you watch the Safdie’s unnerving thriller. After all, men have been driven to madness by vague glowing objects throughout history, and Howard is no different. Hence, the self-sabotage. And Now, The Pitch: Now that we’re truly acquainted, you should know that Howard runs a jewelry shop in New York’s Diamond District, which means it’s the size of a shoebox and has a bustling chaotic energy that never seems to calm. To Howard, the gem is the answer to all of his problems — at least his financial woes — for he plans to use the profits to get his brother-in-law’s goons off his back. But also pay back the other dozen guys he owes. And maybe also get back the watches he pawned without permission. The list is long and anxious and bewildering and that’s the point. The Safdies want you to feel as if there’s no escape, and Howard’s desperation is only amplified by the ensuing stakes. Almost immediately, we meet Howard’s colleague Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), who brings in high-profile clients interested in the flashy bling he’s peddling. A-listers like NBA superstar Kevin Garnett, who plays himself here in a terrific, lively performance. Overexcited and exasperated, Howard can’t help but show off the gem to Garnett, despite the fact that he has no intention of selling it to him. (He has plans to auction it off to the tune of $1 million later in the week.) But after he passionately explains its origins and why it’s so special and rare (“Black Jew Power,” as Demany succinctly puts it shortly after this exchange), Garnett insists on owning it, believing it will bring him luck in the NBA Finals. Adding to his dilemmas, Howard agrees to let Garnett hold on to it for just one night, and this is first in what winds up being a series of increasingly poor decisions made over the course of the film’s two hour and 15 minute runtime. From there, Howard must continue to deal with the fallout of his crumbling marriage to his wife (a ferocious Idina Menzel), and figure out if his young mistress (Julia Fox, quite a discovery), who he rents an apartment for, really did cheat on him with The Weeknd. (It should be noted that The Weekend also plays himself, and gets to perform a great song off his era-appropriate mixtape, which is a delicious treat.) So, as you can see, life’s truly a gem for Howard Ratner. Yeah, Yeah, But What’s This Movie Really Getting At? For Howard, the stress of all his wheeling and dealing appears to be what he feeds on, and he’s always doubling down when he should retreat. Uncut Gems is the story of a degenerate gambler, who keeps making riskier and riskier bets in all facets of his life until it all blows up spectacularly and ends the only way it ever could. It’s a movie about addiction, being your own worst enemy, and not getting out of your own way. It’s grim, to be sure, but it’s packaged as a nail-biting thriller, one that builds to an amazing high-wire-act of a finale that turns a 2012 Celtics playoff game into the most important thing you’ve ever seen in cinema. It’s a remarkable achievement that’s not just one of the best films of the year, but also one of Sandler’s best of all time. Oh, and it features the only hiding of the Afikoman scene I can recall in a movie, so it’s sure to rank highly in the Jewish cinema pantheon. “This Is How I Win”: Sandler has said that it would be a “funny big thing” if he were to receive an Oscar nomination for the film, adding that he would be “there to win.” “If I don’t get it, I’m going to fucking come back and do one again that is so bad on purpose just to make you all pay. That’s how I get them.” The Sandman may have been kidding during this recent exchange on The Howard Stern Show, but the buzz surrounding his performance is no joke. Since the film’s rousing debut at this year’s Telluride, critics have hailed his performance, and rightly so. It’s terrific and arguably the best work he’s ever done, and certainly the most challenging, ranking up there with his turn in 2002’s Punch Drunk Love. While Howard Ratner is undeniably Adam Sandler, one of the most famous actors in the world, you’ve definitely never seen him like this before. He’s working with non-actors, some of them literally off the street because this is a Safdies production, and there’s just a sense of authenticity and rawness that you don’t see in mainstream cinema. His character is manic, panicked, and never not talking. You get the impression that all of his problems would fall away if he would just shut the fuck up for three seconds, but he simply can’t do that. Because of this, Sandler is so much fun to watch, and we’re inherently sympathetic to his character because, well, it’s fucking Adam Sandler. We’re conditioned to be, which is why it’s such brilliant casting on behalf of the Safdies. Associations notwithstanding, Sandler more than rises to the occasion, delivering an electric performance that rides so many different wavelengths. It’s hard to put into words the sheer joy of watching him go ballistic during that final scene in the jewelry store. He’s like a goddamn bull in a China shop. The Verdict: All that being said, Uncut Gems is simply too “out-there” of a movie to garner any serious attention from Oscar voters. Let’s not forget the Safdies’ previous film, 2017’s Good Time. It’s not only one of the best thrillers of the 2010s, but also features Robert Pattinson’s greatest performance to date, and it was completely snubbed. It’s likely that may happen again, particularly since Uncut Gems is just as dirty, just as grimy, and just as bleak. Here’s hoping the Academy proves us wrong because this is easily the most immersive movie-going experience you’ll have this year — if not ever. The Safdies continue to outmatch themselves, and their brazen filmography remains uncontested.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019","Everything is simultaneously terrifying, horrifying and mesmerizing in Mr. Sandler's new movie. Uncut Gems is a dark sparkler.",POSITIVE
"Dec 13, 2019"," While it might be misleading to describe Benny and Josh Safdie’s unceasingly tense and jittery low-level crime thriller Uncut Gems as a comedy, the directors’ singular sense of humor is on display from the grandiose opening sequence. In an Ethiopian opal mine, a worker has suffered a serious injury. Washing away the cascade of blood on his leg reveals a shattered bone thrusting through the skin. But two other miners use the distraction as an opportunity to slip stealthily into the caves to abscond with a massive and rare black opal. The camera winds through the tunnels and then the Safdies immediately cut to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a successful New York City jeweler, getting a colonoscopy. The transition is, like the medical procedure itself, both dark and cheeky. Other high/low gags appear throughout Uncut Gems, like the running one where Howard’s girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox) always ends conversations with “I love you!” to which Howard replies by hanging up or walking away. That one, though, pays off in a way that is both beautiful and pathetic. Or beautifully pathetic, a pretty decent description of Howard himself. There’s a two-year gap between the Ethiopian mining accident and Howard’s colonoscopy. We soon learn that, in that span of time, Howard has negotiated to buy the black opal. It arrives just in time for him to put it up at auction in the hopes of a million dollar payday, which he desperately needs to pay off an increasingly threatening bookie (Eric Bogosian). It won’t be easy, though, as Howard constantly angles for a slightly wider margin, making risky bets and playing with other people’s money. His nauseous misadventures bring him into contact with a wild roster of celebrities playing themselves, from Kevin Garnett (who is amazing) to The Weeknd to, very briefly, John Amos. Mike Francesa, somehow, is not playing Mike Francesa in his two-scene role. Uncut Gems is, somewhat unexpectedly, a period piece. The specificity of its May of 2012 setting, though, starts to seem less bizarre as it becomes clear how crucial Howard’s gambling on that NBA season’s Eastern conference semifinals is to the plot. This allows for other fun details, too. The Weeknd is still nearly a year and a half from releasing his first official album; we get snippets of him performing “The Morning” from his first mixtape. Other particulars in Uncut Gems likely went over my head as I’m a Midwestern Catholic and the Jewishness of Howard and his family are often center stage. Suffice it to say, one of the movie’s high points is a scene at a Seder where Howard and Gooey (Judd Hirsch) talk trash behind the back of the non-Jew in attendance and Howard’s soon-to-be ex-wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), tries to see if she can fit into her bat mitzvah dress while the children look for the afikoman. If that sounds like a lot going on at once, keep in mind that it’s one of Uncut Gems‘ calmer sequences. Much of the film’s tension comes from its relentlessness. It sometimes feels impossible to catch a breath between the overlapping, shouted dialogue and the lush, varied score by Daniel Lopatin (also known as Oneohtrix Point Never). It’s just shy of cacophony but the Safdies remain ever in control of both sound and image. Even as scenes feel captured on the fly, there’s a sure and guiding hand (or four of them) at the wheel. The movie’s structure and mechanisms reflect those of Howard’s mind. Barely controlled chaos seems to be the only mode in which he can even pretend to function. In a sense, then, Howard is a very driven character. But not, however, in the way that we tend to use that word. Generally, drive is paired with ambition. There’s an assumption that the driven individual is driven toward… something. Howard, on the other hand, is nothing but drive and, for 134 adrenalized, unflinching, emotionally and physically thrilling minutes, we get to ride along with him. It’s a shame it ever has to stop.",POSITIVE
"Dec 12, 2019"," Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), the protagonist of the nervy drama “Uncut Gems,” almost never stops moving. He also almost never stops talking, and his loud, abrasive Long Island nasal intonation is often irritating. Howard himself is annoying, impulsive, and disrespectful — and those are his better qualities. Being with him is both exhausting and exasperating, and viewers get to spend nearly 135 minutes with him in the exhilarating new Safdie Brothers’ film. It's the Spring of 2012, and Howard is a high-strung, hot-headed, motormouth jeweler in New York City. He hustles. He has to. He is up to his neck in debt and doubling down by making crazy bets in hope of a big payoff. He's also under immense pressure as audiences are first introduced to him as he's getting a colonoscopy, which just increases his anxiety levels since his doctor is insisting on double-checking some results. Yet Howard seems to think he finally has an opportunity to silence all comers. When a package arrives at his store containing an opal from the Ethiopian Welo mine, this uncut gem is — after multiplying the carats — likely worth over a million dollars.
To get the cash, the opal is going to be auctioned off, but before Howard delivers it to the seller, he loans it to Kevin Garnett, the Boston Celtics center. The opal brings Garnett good luck, and Howard lucks out at first, too. Of course, Howard’s good fortune and good mood are not going to last, which is why his long, downward spiral is so absorbing for viewers who can appreciate the wild ride. (The film should also generate a fair number of walkouts by folks who can’t take the strain). Garnett fails to return the opal as promised. Howard is shaken down by his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian), among others, for money owed. And he has tensions at home with his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel). His problems multiply, like the opal’s carats, but he just stays focused on that payday. “Uncut Gems” insists on keeping audiences on tenterhooks as Howard tries to play the ends against the middle — or just stay one step ahead of his enemies—waiting for his windfall. He becomes enraged when the security door of his jewelry store won’t open, and unglued when he tries to resolve a perceived error with the auction house. Such moments are compelling because Sandler (and the Safdie brothers) are so committed to Howard. They understand what makes this schmuck tick, and viewers will, too. He is compulsive. He is a liar. And he does not know how to not misbehave. When Howard hands out a series of expensive watches to folks he owes money to, he is literally borrowing time (and money). Howard often puts people in a bad position — especially his family — and he asks practically everyone he meets for a favor and a second chance. His desperation is cringe-inducing, and his ability to screw things up badly is darkly funny. It is hard not to marvel at Howard’s juggling. He can work a room of customers, bark deals at everyone he meets, and try frantically to manage his wife, kids, and mistress. (There is an amusing episode where Howard goes to great lengths to prevent his son from learning about his mistress, but the kid does, causing him additional and unnecessary aggravation.) By the time his doctor calls with the results of his biopsy, it is almost a relief; either Howard will be healthy to continue living his hectic life, or he can plan for an early death that will end this hell on earth of his own making. “Uncut Gems” depicts some real risky behavior as it unfolds, and viewers may be wise to bring a case of Tums to chew on, especially during the film’s nail-biter of an ending. Howard revels in the beauty of high-stakes betting in a virtuoso scene where he goes all-in on Garnett in Game 7 of a series. The sequence showcases Sandler’s tour-de-force performance. As manic Howard experiences all kinds of emotions watching this critical basketball game, viewers cheer and sweat out the results along with Howard. The Safdie brothers wring every moment for maximum anxiety, and they are downright relentless. The filmmakers employ a handheld camera to convey the intense pressure of Howard’s life, following him constantly and pushing close-ups to scrutinize him. There is care and attention to the costumes — Idina Menzel gets decked out like a “Real Housewives of Long Island,” and she is worshipped when she fits into her bat mitzvah dress. The jewelry is also perfect. There is a great bit where Howard shows off a tacky “gremlin” necklace with moving eyes to Kevin Garnett. Even the synth music score, by Daniel Lopatin is effective, as is the use of Billy Joel’s “The Stranger” in an appropriately revealing moment. “Uncut Gems” does have a few quiet moments, such as one where Sandler tries to talk with his daughter, or another, at a seder, where Howard has to read the plagues aloud — an obvious metaphor for all that is torturous in his own life. These scenes hint at the possible mensch Howard could have been if he had empathy for others, and was not so consumed with hubris, greed, and lust. A scene where he tries to connect with his wife is highly satisfying because of her reasoned, no-nonsense response to his behavior. Sandler’s performance is transfixing because he makes viewers root for this poor bastard, generating sympathy even when Howard is wrongly on the attack, or at his most despicable. He is hard-headed, unpolished, thoroughly infuriating, and impossible not to watch. Sandler reaches giddy highs when Howard is sexting his mistress Julia (Julia Fox), but also extreme lows, as when he hits rock bottom with a bloodied face, a bruised ego, and an uncertain future. In support, Julia Fox, in her feature debut, is also fantastic. After Julia and Howard get into an argument at a nightclub, the Safdie brothers give Fox a scene-stealing moment. As Julia cools off, walking with shame and anger past the “losers” standing outside the club she was just ejected from, she absorbs all that has just happened to her. Fox masks Julia’s considerable pain while also deflecting the taunts the witnesses are shouting at her. It is a remarkable sequence that shows the resilience of her character, and her mettle becomes an asset in the film’s smart denouement. “Uncut Gems” is merciless, but it is a shrewd character study. It is designed to keep viewers unsettled, which it does, admirably. And yet, for all the vexation the film engenders, there is still a corker of an ending. Copyright © 2024 Salon.com, LLC.

"Dec 12, 2019"," Josh and Benny Safdie do not make movies for the masses. The New York natives have been making features for a decade now, though they arguably didn’t become names on the independent scene until 2014’s “Heaven Knows What.” Both that film and their follow-up, the 2017 Robert Pattinson vehicle “Good Time,” take place on the grimy, slimy streets of New York – throwbacks to a bygone era of seediness with a particularly modern flair. Heroin addicts, petty criminals, the dregs of the Earth – these are the subjects of the Safdies, whose films have been marked with a kinetic energy that resembles an unceasing panic attack. Anyone who read interviews with the Safdies leading up to those films likely heard about a project they’d been working on since they started making features called “Uncut Gems,” set in New York’s Diamond District. Now, “Uncut Gems” is finally seeing the light of day. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) owns a jewelry store and uses the money he earns from activities both licit and illicit to feed an out of control gambling habit. As is always the case with inveterate and compulsive gamblers, Howard racks up debts across the city with all sorts of questionable types, and those debts are destined to come due. But he has an ace up his sleeve – an uncut black opal he imported from Africa that he’s expecting to auction off for seven figures. When one of Howard’s associates (Lakeith Stanfield) introduces him to NBA superstar Kevin Garnett, he becomes enamored with the opal and borrows it from Howard under the belief that it will bring him good luck in their playoff series against Philadelphia. When he doesn’t want to give it back, Howard’s fragile life is thrown into chaos. With his wife (Idina Menzel) threatening divorce after Passover and his girlfriend/employee (Julia Fox) becoming more unhinged by the day, the maelstrom is unceasing. There are plenty of comparisons that can be made to “Good Time,” another movie about a less-than-perfect person racing against time to get money before the hammer drops on him. Sure, Howard is theoretically a member of polite society, with a beautiful house outside the city and a beautiful apartment for his mistress inside it. But his life is all seedy jewelry stores, pawn shops and back-alley bookies, borrowing, hawking and short-selling his own merchandise so he can get the scratch for his next bet. The longer he chases that perfect score, the perfect bet to make all his troubles go away, the more unsavory sorts he gets on his bad side. Because of this breakneck approach to life, “Uncut Gems” is just as stressful and erratic as its predecessor even without the one-night-to-set-things-right motif undergirding it. The result is unyieldingly propulsive; we have no time to breathe because he has no time to breathe. Sandler is getting all the press coming out of this, and with good reason. He’s a remarkable casting choice, taking advantage of his caustic personality and titanic temper mixed with a healthy helping of charm and charisma that totally explains how he can dig himself in so deep and somehow still get people to go along with his crazy schemes with the preternatural power of needling them into submission. You want him to succeed somehow, but you also definitely want him to get punched in the face for his trouble. He’s the perfect antihero in that sense, and while it’s been seemingly ages since he’s consistently challenged himself as an actor, his work here and in last year’s “The Meyerowitz Stories” prove definitively that he’s got gas left in the tank. He doesn’t leave much room for the rest of the cast, but Lakeith Stanfield is as magnetic and dependable as ever, and Julia Fox impresses as a relative unknown. Garnett hasn’t acted before in any real capacity, but his outsized personality mixed with his prodigious stature make him a striking figure. Most importantly, everyone feels like they belong in this world, no matter how small the role. The Safdies have always excelled at populating their worlds with all manner of exciting and engaging lowlifes via actors both seasoned and not, but all of them feel of a piece. Nothing is awkward or out of place, and considering the pacing, it’s amazing how meticulous it all feels. It’s clear that the Safdies know what they’re doing and what they want to make, marrying aesthetics and storytelling in such a forceful way. Many of their former collaborators have returned for “Uncut Gems,” from “Good Time” composer Daniel Lopatin to longtime co-writer/editor Ronald Bronstein. Respected cinematographer Darius Khondji (“Okja,” “Seven”) is new blood for them, but you’d hardly notice; he’s plenty comfortable playing in their high-octane sandbox. “Uncut Gems” asks so much of its audience that it’s a draining and stressful experience to endure. Over 130 minutes, we see a man deservedly put through the wringer and then, when he seems to finally put everything behind him, happily jump right back in. It’s tense and stressful – the filmic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. Time will tell how many of these sort of films the Safdies have in them because it has to be just as exhausting to shoot them as it is to watch them. But as long as they have the energy, they’ll have the audience. “Uncut Gems” is a massive achievement and their best movie yet, and it’s quite the antidote for the cheery holiday season.

"Dec 12, 2019"," Adam Sandler has been playing jerks and sleazebags for most of his career, but until now his movies didn't make a habit of acknowledging it. So it's exhilarating to watch Uncut Gems, a gritty indie funhouse ride that sets Sandler loose in a world just as manic and angry as his character — a world in which his absurd, impulsive actions have real consequences. Like every straight male under the age of 40, the writer-director brothers Benny and Josh Safdie grew up with the sound of Sandler's screech in their brains. Here they've cracked the code for how to build a riveting story around it, and Sandler himself — in a ratty goatee, designer clothes, and lounge-lizard earrings — has never looked so alive. We're in the New York Diamond District, the domain of Sandler's Howard Ratner, a scheming jeweler and compulsive gambler whose high-risk life choices create a lot of unnecessary problems. Already deeply in debt, Howie pawns another man's collateral on a priceless item to get enough money to place another sports bet; he neglects his wife (Idina Menzel) and family to have an affair with his much younger employee (Julia Fox); and he screws over friend and foe alike with empty promises and IOUs, even as he hoards what little cash he makes for his own schemes. This is an underworld that runs on crass materialism and smokescreens, where rare minerals share a display case and a bartering currency with fake Rolexes, and every space Howie enters seems to be literally glittering with both promise and instability. But he does have a soul buried under that flashy grin, if he can ever figure out who it's in service of. As filmmakers, the Safdies are uniquely attuned to street-level dramas on the margins, but they're also savvy students of genre, and so of course their movie about a jeweler pivots around a shiny MacGuffin. Howie has procured an ultra-rare opal from an Ethiopian diamond mine (it's sent to him stuffed inside a frozen fish for safekeeping) and plans to put it up at auction for north of a million dollars. But that's before Kevin Garnett walks into his life. The NBA star (playing himself in his prime, in a Hall of Fame performance for celebrity non-actors) is entranced by the opal, seeing visions of himself in its prism of pure light and color. This is the most elementary appeal of jewelry, after all, and the Safdies literally plunge us inside the radiant visions this stone induces, visualizing the geological perfection that makes so many sane people do crazy things. KG himself knows anything is possible. Garnett convinces Howie to let him borrow the stone as a good-luck charm while he plays the 2012 NBA semifinals, thus setting off a chain of events that will leave Howie scrambling to stay one step ahead of the debts he owes even as he accumulates more. What's great about Sandler's work here is that, the further he sinks into the muck, the more confident he becomes. He juggles the many, many threats on his life so that he becomes the ringleader of his own circus, gleefully lying through his teeth, spinning verbal patter and slipping into deep, guttural fits of rage when his ducks don't line up precisely. Even the scenes of him watching basketball are riveting.  Uncut Gems follows the mold of the Safdies' previous effort, Good Time, another breakneck New York tale about a guy with a gift for making bad situations worse. These kinds of movies are liable to cause heart palpitations. They shoot their spiralling heroes in tight, claustrophobic close-ups (although cinematographer Darius Khondji is also a fan of security-camera-style overhead zooms) and edit their journeys to induce constant whiplash, with an eye for the tactile qualities of every face, jewel, and carpeted backroom. They also know precisely which buttons to push in their audience: using borrowed time to double down on bad bets is not for those who crave order in their lives.  But Gems also wraps up its most high-wire scenes in some amazing comic setpieces. A malfunction in Howie's security door traps Garnett and his fixer (LaKeith Stanfield) behind bulletproof glass for several minutes. When some collectors pay a visit to Howie during his daughter's school play, they beat him, strip him naked and shove him into the trunk of his car, layering on the humiliations in compounded interest. The movie understands the comic (and cosmic) power of making the world's best bluffer run straight off a cliff. Of course, thanks to fare like Punch-Drunk Love, we've known Sandler was always capable of a performance like this. But it feels even sweeter plopped into his extended late-career phase of lazy cash-cow comedies. After all, this character's worldview is the product of a bottomless tackiness and naked desire for profit, a middle-aged man who wants the world to know what he thinks he's worth. There's not much daylight between Howie hawking a bedazzled Furby to star athletes and the real Sandler roping Al Pacino into a retina-scarring Dunkin' Donuts commercial. What's different is the self-reflection, the knowledge that bending the world to your will over and over is going to piss off everyone around you. This is what the actor and the film do so well in concert with each other. It's the right movie for the right person at the right time, a thing of strange beauty forged under a mountain of heat, pressure, and irritation.",POSITIVE
"Dec 12, 2019"," After watching Uncut Gems, every part of my being is exhausted. “Intense” is a gross understatement. I’m walking away feeling like this film is a sadistic exercise in how to emotionally and physically manipulate an audience. I suppose this is a good thing. Great movies should intentionally make you feel something, whether its love, inspiration, or in this case, dread with a dash of hopelessness. Don’t get me wrong, I love Uncut Gems. There are two undeniable stars of this film. For starters, this movie could not have been made without Adam Sandler. Fans will understand this because he’s nailed down the “unlikable, but sweet” roles in comedy ever since the beginning of his career. In Uncut Gems, he brings his unlikeable sweetness to the dark, dramatic thriller. Whatever bias you may have about Sandler’s comedies fade away here. Sandler gives a genuine and physically brutal performance of a man who’s trying to stay one step ahead of total collapse. The second star is the story by the Safdie Brothers. Everyone’s going to call Uncut Gems a roller-coaster ride, and they’d be right. We ascend upward as Howard figures a way out of his major predicament. Then we fly over the apex as the plan is in motion, and the high-speed descent sends us through sharp turns, banks, and inversion as his plan all falls apart. The Safdie Brothers also brilliantly stay a few steps ahead as you never see the next turn coming. It all ends with an abrupt, yet satisfying, stop at the end. It’s not all twists and turns. Quiet moments are brought in before each ascent to serve as a momentary rest from the insanity. The best of these moments come from the two female leads: Idina Menzel and Julia Fox. Both actors play very different versions of the women in his life and bring out Ratner’s desperation and depravity. Speaking of its supporting cast, every player is equally good at supporting this complex story, including its non-actors: Kevin Garnett and The Weeknd. It’s a strong ensemble from start to finish and their sole purpose to support the Safdie’s well-developed story (another good ensemble can be found in Ford v Ferrari). I loved Uncut Gems. It’s a brutal watch, and my nerves are still too frazzled to see it again, but I will.

From the moment of his introduction, Howard, a gambler and philanderer, is spread too thin, and he then spends the length of the film seeing how much thinner he can go. He has it all and keeps going back for more, more, more, because as much as Howard shows himself capable of love, it’s action that he loves most—risk is his aphrodisiac. We follow him through a knotty series of robbing-Peter-to-pay-Paul improvisations, exchanges which involve outstanding sports gambling debts and an Ethiopian black opal, illegally imported in the guts of a dead fish, that Howard has slated for auction. The opal, mined by Ethiopian Jews, catches the eye of Boston Celtics power forward Kevin Garnett, representative of the elite black clientele brought through Ratner’s shop by middleman Demany (Lakeith Stanfield). (The movie gets a good sense of the motley, polyglot racial makeup of New York City, though the peculiarities of the relations between its black and Jewish populations are foregrounded.) On the eve of a playoff series, Garnett becomes possessed by the idea that the stone is a good-luck charm. It’s a competitive world, and everybody’s looking for an edge. In a not unsubstantial role, the now forty-three-year-old Garnett plays his younger self—the movie is a “period piece,” set a little less than eight years ago—with an intensity that will be unsurprising to those who remember his postgame interviews. It’s one of several examples of the brothers’ nonprofessional casting that adds a layer of verisimilitude, splashes of local color, and a touch of the surreal to Uncut Gems: WFAN sports talk staple Mike Francesca has a couple of scenes as a bookmaker, the musician the Weeknd plays himself at the cusp of fame, and Good Times actor John Amos has a very funny deadpan cameo. The movie is the Safdies’ second consecutive feature on 35 mm—Good Time was shot with a higher-grain 2-perf process. Darius Khondji has replaced their previous cinematographer/DP Sean Price Williams, but their visual approach remains familiar: long lenses that lend street scenes a sense of caught-on-the-fly happenstance, close-ups that vibrate with intent focus, and an often-active camera, here swinging with the beat of a multitasker’s overtaxed attention. De-glammed Midtown locations keep the action at ground level, a reproach to thousands of establishing skyline drone shots littering the surplus of NYC-set films that are interested in the city as a backdrop rather than a place where people manage to live. Here, exigencies are considered and geography is precise, down to the practical considerations involved in catching a helicopter to Mohegan Sun, while the calendar is freely tinkered with, as the movie takes place over a compressed, cheated timeline that overlaps a Passover celebration, Howard’s awaiting the results of a colonoscopy, and the 2012 seven-game semifinals series between the Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. In making the results of a playoff series a life-and-death matter for an in-too-deep gambler, Uncut Gems owes not a little to 1992’s Bad Lieutenant, a film by another New York moviemaker distinguished by his commitment to capturing the tonality of the city—Abel Ferrara, who turned in a cameo in the Safdies’ 2009 Daddy Longlegs. In its cultural specificities and its humor, however, Uncut Gems is very much its own animal. Ferrara is Italian Catholic, and his background profoundly informed the guilt- and redemption-riven Bad Lieutenant. The Safdies are Jewish, as is Sandler, as is the Safdies’ close collaborator Ronald Bronstein, the director of the 2007 cult feature Frownland who has also helped to write and cut every one of the Safdies’ films since Daddy Longlegs, in which Bronstein starred. Uncut Gems is, more than any film they’ve made, an explicitly Jewish one, replete with a family seder presided over by Judd Hirsch. Uncut Gems is a pricier production than any the Safdies have made before, a logical progression from the budgetary step-up of Good Time, which had the coup of landing Robert Pattinson as a lead. They have not, for their deeper pockets, notably softened or diluted their approach to address a broader audience. Howard is as difficult a character as any they’ve depicted, and Sandler, whose longevity as a star has depended in large part on his everyman amiability, employs that same ingratiating charisma in his bluster, the difference being he occasionally lets slip glances of the ingratiating, feckless bullshit artist behind it. Never has his sheepish smile, here a shade too white, seemed more wily or carnivorous; never has his nervous laugh sounded so edged with mortal terror. In style, too, the Safdies remain willfully abrasive, from their juddering camerawork to the soundtrack’s cacophony, provided again by Good Time composer Oneohtrix Point Never and often cranked, as is the persecutorial jibber-jabber and jackhammer-and-car-horn musique concrète of city life. With exciting and nervy American movies thin on the vine, it seems almost ungrateful to say that Uncut Gems, which is both, doesn’t signify a great leap forward for the Safdies, but rather the maintenance of a holding pattern. They remain expert at involving an audience step-by-step in the experience of slow-mounting, gut-twisting panic, and are ingenious when it comes to devising out-there situations and then following them, following the logic of character, to their natural conclusion. How, for example, do you practically contend with being locked in the trunk of a car without your clothes on during your daughter’s school play? Or with an angry strongman trapped behind the security door of your store? Having been through a few of the Safdies’s cinematic ordeals, however, one starts to wonder what they might look like if the brothers allowed themselves to downshift, to look for a gear outside of fifth-with-the-hammer-down. In Uncut Gems, there are gestures toward this, moments that seek to locate Howard’s flailing within a broader context, somewhere between the macro and the micro—an overture shows the discovery of the sought-after opal in a Welo mine, and in nearly bookending sequences, we voyage into both Howard’s colon and a gunshot wound, discovering otherworldly vistas therein. These cosmic flourishes, the sort of thing you might expect from Terrence Malick or Krzysztof Zanussi, seem to stand apart from the film itself, belonging as it does to a world decidedly pragmatic and unphilosophical in bent. Perhaps to ask for more is to ask the Safdies to compromise their worldview, which presents modern life as a breathless full-court press, a heedless hustle and bustle, a constant contest that can’t be won but only, finally, stopped. In such a world, even their downbeat endings—and Uncut Gems is no exception—come to seem redemptive, in the sense that they offer the relief of rest, even the quiet of the grave.

"Dec 12, 2019"," Howard
Ratner (Adam Sandler) is juggling a lot of things, because Howard has a single,
all-encompassing problem. Nothing is good enough for him. There's always some
big win on the horizon, and he's certain that one of those gambles is going to
pay off. It has to. He keeps losing and losing, and with enough time and enough
gambles, the odds eventually have to even out for him. Uncut
Gems follows Howard over the course of
a long weekend, when the consequences of all of his bets and schemes and hustles
and lies come at him at once. The man is obnoxious and self-destructive, and the
film, written by Ronald Bronstein and fraternal directors Benny and Josh Safdie,
makes no apologies for him. The closest it comes to offering any sympathy for
Howard is in its constant assertions, based solely on the character's behavior,
that the man is an addict. There
are a few moments in which things seem to be going well for Howard, if only for
brief period, and the look of pure, nearly orgasmic bliss on his face tells us
everything we need to know about him. He spends the entire story chasing that
feelingthat he matters, that his self-imposed problems will finally
dissipate, that all of the hard work and pain might finally pay off, that he has
won. Most of
the film, though, isn't about the joy of a big gamble hitting. That doesn't
happen for a guy like Howard, who has his fingers in so many pies that he
probably needs to take off his shoes and socksjust to have a few more digits
available for the new pies in his life. He's in
debt to too many people to remember. The big debt belongs to Arno (Eric Bogosian),
who has a pair of heavies confronting and following Howard as much as possible.
They get rough with the guy, but Arno, whose eyes twinkle a bit whenever he lets
himself believe that Howard might hit it big with one his plans, keeps them on a
leashfor a reason that ultimately shows just how desperate and insensible
Howard actually is. The
money he does make, from selling his friend Demany's (LaKeith Stanfield) phony
watches and pawning a championship ring on loan to him from professional
basketball player Kevin Garnett (playing himself), doesn't go to paying off his
creditors. He puts that cash on elaborate betsnamely on the player whose ring
is currently funding the wager. The
only reason the famous athlete lets Howard have the ring involves a rare black
opal, which Howard has purchased from exploited miners in Ethiopia. Howard
assumes the gem could nab him at least a million dollars at auction, and when
the basketball player points out the inconsistency of what he paid those miners
for it, Howard can't comprehend the concept. After all, his mind is too busy
working out another, last-ditch scheme. Meanwhile,
Howard's marriage is about to end, although he keeps stallingtelling his wife
Dinah (Idina Menzel) that they can tell the kids after Passover (where, in a
cheeky gag, he lists off the plagues), although maybe it might be better to wait
a few months after that. The whole film, really, is about Howard delaying the
inevitable. Additionally,
he neglects his children, who are of an age that they're going figure outif
they haven't alreadythat his absence is probably for the best in the long
run. He also treats his loving mistress Julia (Julia Fox, in an auspicious debut
performance) like garbage. He does so despiteor maybe even because ofthe
fact that Julia seems to be only person who believes in him. Fox's performance
begins as a caricature, but by the end, she has turned Julia into a full
characterone whom Howard definitely doesn't deserve. We
don't have sympathy for Howard, and at no point do the filmmakers even attempt
to turn him into a sympathetic figure. In fact, they set up some things, such as
an introductory colonoscopy and the discovery of a polyp, only to cancel them. A
disease would be too easy of an out for Howard, and Bronstein and the Safdies
clearly are of the mind that he doesn't deserve one. What,
then, is the appeal of this story, focused so intently and with such unwavering
judgement on this unsympathetic man? Part of the allure is that it's refreshing
to see filmmakers telling it like it is with their protagonistshowing him at
his worst, not providing him with any outs, never trying to weigh a single
positive against the overwhelmingly negative bulk of his character. There's
something daring in that, and in the way the film shows how Howard's path toward
self-destruction has affected others (the state of his family, the treatment of
Julia, and, in a harrowing scene, the way he encourages a family member to risk
almost $200,000 at an auction), there's even a bit of morality to this amoral
tale. From a
far less righteous perspective, though, there is something inescapably
enthralling in seeing this man go for it with such wild abandon. The film is
propulsive, moving from one scheme to the next, and often anxiety-inducing in
the knowledge that Howard, no matter how hard he tries, is going to keep being a
loser in his dealings. That is his life's compulsion. We don't sympathize with
him, but we can, at least, comprehend that drive. Sandler's
performance here is easily one of the actor's bestif not his best flat-out.
For one thing, it's exceptional character work, always attuned to Howard's
desperation and, in the few quieter moments, showing the insecurity that's at
the heart of his questionable quest to become a winner. On a more fundamental
level, though, the Safdies seem keenly aware that Sandler's screen persona,
always stewing with some deeper rage, isn't an inherently sympathetic one. The
casting is perfect for this particular character, but even so, Sandler goes
above and beyond in his portrayal of this perennial loser-by-choice. We
don't have to like the guy. We just have to understand Howard, and Uncut
Gems, with its unceasing momentum and its superficially thrilling but
genuinely terrifying depiction of addiction, really makes us understand him.",POSITIVE
"Dec 12, 2019"," Who is Howard Ratner, the unhinged snapping turtle of a Diamond District jeweler played with ferocious abandon by Adam Sandler in the high wire gambling drama Uncut Gems? Ask Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), a fixer who works on commission to rope hip hop stars and NBA millionaires into Howard’s bulletproof-glass enclosed showroom, and he’ll announce to the world that Howard is a “crazy ass Jew.” According to Dinah (Idina Menzel), the wife with whom he has three children and to whom he has become increasingly estranged, he is “the most annoying person I have ever met.” Arno (Eric Bogosian), the brother-in-law and loan shark to whom Howard owes an obscene amount of money, will let you know simply that he is a moron—and that’s after he instructed a pair of thugs to yank off Howard’s clothes and stuff him in the trunk of his car as if he were a set of golf clubs. In truth it’s hard to get a read on Howard and why he behaves in the boorishly self-destructive manner that he does. We spend a week deep inside the 48-year-old’s chaotic existence in the spring of 2012, which is when the film, directed by Josh and Benny Safdie and written by them and their longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein, takes place. The man is perhaps so hard to decipher because, to quote the gastroenterologist who is in the middle of giving him a colonoscopy when we first meet him (one of his only moments of peace in the film), Howard is “well cleaned out”—and not just in the way the good doctor means. Howard is also emptied out spiritually, emotionally (and, most pressing to his ability to survive the week) financially. UNCUT GEMS ★★★1/2
(3.5/4 stars)
Directed by: Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie
Written by: Josh Safdie, Benny Safdie and Ronald Bronstein
Starring: Adam Sandler, Lakeith Stanfield, Kevin Garnett, Idina Menzel, Julia Fox, Eric Bogosian, Judd Hirsch and The Weeknd
Running time: 134 mins. Yet we still end up feeling like we know him—which is almost entirely credit to Sandler. The actor imbues Howard with all the rage and isolation, the sadness and arrested development, that he has spent his career hinting at with his comic creations from SNL’s Canteen Boy to Happy Madison and beyond. The character reverberates with these conflicting energies; we don’t understand him as much we as we feel him. While there’s nothing particularly funny about Howard or the movie (if you laugh, it will be more to relieve the film’s almost unbearable tension), despite or because of this, he is the fullest expression of Sandler and his singular talents that we have witnessed in his sometimes confounding and often infuriating 30-plus-year career. Part of the success of the performance is the manner in which the Safdies play with and reframe Sandler’s persona and reputation for outrageousness and immaturity, using it to fuel their movie’s nihilism. But then the film, which features The Weeknd as a coke-snorting, groupie-canoodling version of himself, in many ways is a treatise on the idea of persona, and all that it reveals and disguises. Sandler’s primary costar is the retired NBA power forward Kevin Garnett, who also plays a version of himself, in his final year with the Celtics and embroiled in a tense up-and-down playoff series against the 76ers. Showing a remarkable screen presence (he far outplays former teammate Ray Allen, who was a hoops prodigy in Spike Lee’s 1998 film He Got Game), Garnett plays himself as a tender and insecure superstar who becomes convinced he can only play up to his potential if he is in possession of an uncut opal that Howard has procured, perhaps illicitly, from an Ethiopian mine. Howard is certain that this bit of information is all he needs to score big with a local bookie (played with hard-won authenticity by NYC sports talk legend Mike Francesa) and later at Mohegan Sun. With their sixth feature, the Safdies have a lot to say about a lot of subjects—Judaism, celebrity and sports culture, and post-recession capitalism just to name a few—and most of it is said at top volume. Whether it’s Howard’s grating mishegas, the angry demands of the many who want a piece of him, or Daniel Lopatin’s 80s-informed synth-heavy soundtrack, the movie is a lot to listen to. You may even find yourself plugging your ears at points, which is just fine. Most of the relevant information is ably conveyed with the gritty and probing camera work of Darius Khondji, who also shot David Fincher’s Se7en and who is as comfortable exploring the innards of Howard’s showroom as he is the endless facets of his prize gemstone. The Safdies’ film is a cinematically expressive tightrope walk that seems designed to leave your blood pressure permanently spiked. It can be relentless and hard to take, but it is brimming with surprise and a vivacity that radiates off the screen. By not only giving us a glimpse of a take-no-prisoners New York City that is quickly vanishing but also showing us in full flower the true spectrum of colors possessed by a star many of us wrote off years ago, Uncut Gems ends up providing that rarest commodity in modern film going: a genuine sense of discovery.

"Dec 12, 2019","The story's unrelenting nature works against it, blunting the lure of seeing Adam Sandler in one of his occasional dramatic performances -- a showy role, yes, but in a movie that proves all that glitters is not gold.",NEGATIVE
"Dec 12, 2019"," “Uncut Gems,” the latest from the brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, blows in like a Category 4 hurricane. It’s a tumult of sensory extremes, of images and sounds, lurching shapes, braying voices, intensities of feeling and calculated craziness. So, naturally it stars — why not? — Adam Sandler as a cheat, liar, loving dad, bad husband, jealous lover and compulsive gambler who can’t stop, won’t stop acting the fool. The Safdies, two of the more playfully inventive filmmakers working in American cinema, won’t stop, either, which makes “Uncut Gems” fun if also wearying and at times annoying. It doesn’t seem to add up to much — a little man lives his life — but this is just enough. It’s easier to admire than to love, and I hate the ending, but the Safdies clearly like working your nerves. They’re not interested in the dumb, easy stuff movies give you — the likable, relatable characters, the sermonizing and moralizing; they’re too busy deploying color and noise, pushing the form, testing their (and our) limits. Amid this enjoyable chaos, Sandler plays Howard Ratner, who has a small jewelry store in the Diamond District of Manhattan. He has a few employees, one of whom is his mistress (Julia Fox), and an aggrieved wife (Idina Menzel) who’s fed up with him. He’s a careless family man, but he dotes on his sons and still clocks in for homey obligations. There’s a leisurely Passover Seder in the middle of the movie that’s suffused with love and alive with squalling kids, bustling women and well-padded men chewing cigars. But Howard has his plagues: He’s a gambler and presumably an unlucky one given the heavy debt that he’s carrying. Lots of stuff happens, lots and lots, and some of it can be hard to track. But the bedlam is intentional and amusing. All you need to do is latch onto Howard as he runs from here to there, yelling greetings, taking calls, making deals, always moving amid jump cuts, zooms and lurid close-ups. (The superb cinematography is by Darius Khondji, shooting on 35-millimeter film.) Howard’s dodging some toughs who work for a mystery man whom he owes big; the men are scary, bruisers with cruelty etched in their faces and no trace of the usual movie manicuring. One (Keith Williams Richards) punches Howard in the kisser, which is almost understandable. Written by the Safdies with their regular collaborator, the filmmaker Ronald Bronstein, “Uncut Gems” opens with a prologue, a familiar enough narrative strategy. It’s unusual, though, for the Safdies, as is the site: a mine in Ethiopia, where throngs of men are scrambling around a gravely wounded worker. The location shooting initially seems pointless (what happens could be conveyed in dialogue), and like the casting of Sandler, it broadcasts that they’re working with a higher budget. Structurally, the opener echoes the clichéd place-setting in Hollywood adventures, the ones with dashing heroes, offensively exoticized extras and maybe a mummy or two. More specifically, the dusty, enigmatic opener in “Uncut Gems” drolly echoes the start of “The Exorcist” (1973), where a priest at an archaeological dig in Iraq unearths the demonic relic that sets off the ensuing horror, the possession and spewing vomit. The magical discovery here is made by two Ethiopian miners, who sneak away from the bedlam to dig out a similar-looking lumpy rock. This turns out to be a huge black opal that soon ends up in Howard’s possession, though not for long. Like the “Exorcist” relic, the opal proves an ominous if more contemporary fetish with a near-magical, increasingly dangerous hold on everyone who comes in contact with it.

"Dec 12, 2019"," It seems like there were no good movies in 2019 until there were tons of them. Parasite, Marriage Story, The Two Popes, The Report, Waves, Atlantics—these are probably my favorites, and I would consider adding The Irishman, but to be honest, that was a pretty long 209 minutes. I prefer my crime movies lean and mean—which is why I loved Josh and Benny Safdie’s gloriously unglamorous, exhilaratingly tense Manhattan Diamond District thriller, Uncut Gems, opening in limited release this weekend. If you’ve seen the Safdies’ movies before—2017’s Good Time with Robert Pattinson or 2014’s drug romance, Heaven Knows What—you won’t go into this one unprepared. Uncut Gems is in your face; it’s gaudy, maximalist, headlong, vérité. The talk among gem dealers, hustlers, tough guys, con men, wives, and girlfriends is cacophonous. The camera never stops moving. Violence always feels imminent. “A lot” is my two-word review. Uncut Gems is a lot. It’s also an Adam Sandler movie, though not like any Sandler movie since his last outing with an auteur, Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories (and before that, Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love). This movie, like those, reminds us that Sandler has been slumming it in disposable comedies for most of his career. He utterly disappears into his role as Howard Ratner, a gem dealer with problems galore, including gambling debts and an exotic opal he’s imported from Africa with the quixotic intention of wiping them away and making a killing. Nothing goes according to plan, though Ratner is one of those quicksilver rogues who can talk themselves out of anything and skip ahead of consequences. Much has been made, recently, of Sandler’s decency, his loyalty, and everyday niceness. He sat for a rare (and delightful) profile in the New York Times, went on Fallon, gave a winning interview to 60 Minutes. Perhaps it’s that quality that powers Sandler’s astonishing performance (inexplicably overlooked at the Golden Globes). Ratner is a man who lies constantly—he seems incapable of truthfulness—but who’s somehow never mendacious or cruel. Shambolic though he may be, and dressed in haute schmuck style, Ratner presides over his windowless gem shop with a kind of benevolent slipperiness. He can shout over anyone and accomplish anything: convince his furious wife (Idina Menzel) to give him one more chance, talk his neglected mistress (Julia Fox) out of her clothes, con NBA star Kevin Garnett out of his championship ring, force hitmen to see a sports bet through to its end. Uncut Gems, filmed on location and cast with a bevy of non-actors essentially playing themselves, is a kind of love letter to the Safdies’ world. (Their father, a recent New Yorker profile tells us, was a runner in the Diamond District.) It’s gleefully anarchic and determined to leave you exhausted. Mission accomplished. And yet: two hours and 15 minutes! That’s the length a movie should be.

"Dec 12, 2019"," “Uncut Gems” begins with a grim jolt of 21st century realism somewhere in the Welo opal mines of Ethiopia, where a worker has been seriously injured in an accident. But within moments the action has taken on a dark, primordial undertow, a rumble of something as ancient as fable or myth. After pausing to take in the grisly scene, the camera darts after two men who, amid the bloody chaos, have snuck back into the mine, like bandits raiding a cave of wonders. They pry loose a lump of rock embedded with several shimmering gemstones, an ill-gotten treasure that is about to change quite a few lives, none for the better. By the next scene, after an extraordinary visual transition that should be seen on the biggest screen possible, we are in the company of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a fast-talking, middle-aged jewelry dealer who owns a store in Manhattan’s diamond district. We won’t see the miners again, but the ominous voices we hear in the opening moments of Howard’s story might as well be theirs. Rising and surging with Daniel Lopatin’s propulsive electronic score, they suggest a kind of anguished Greek chorus, unleashing a doom-laden prophecy that will be fulfilled over the course of this great, queasy rush of a movie. Directed with relentless tension and diamond-hard intelligence by Josh and Benny Safdie (who earlier this month won directing honors from the New York Film Critics Circle), “Uncut Gems” is a thriller and a character study, a tragedy and a blast. It’s a throwback to the sordid ’70s crime pictures once popularized by filmmakers including Martin Scorsese (a credited producer) but also a snapshot of a highly specific time and place — one informed by stories the Safdies heard from their father, who worked in the diamond district himself. Much of the action flows in and out of Howard’s 47th Street shop, where diamond-studded Furbies line the fluorescent-lighted display cases and all manner of customers, some of them famous, are held temporarily at bay by a buzzer-operated door. It’s the spring of 2012, as you might guess when you hear that Kevin Garnett is playing for the Boston Celtics and the Weeknd is in New York on his first U.S. tour, to name two real-life celebrities whose paths will intersect with Howard’s in wittily unpredictable fashion. But the celebrity you may be most surprised to encounter in this grotty world of black-market jewelry and high-stakes sports betting is Adam Sandler himself. His presence here is its own kind of gamble, and it pays off beautifully. The Safdie brothers (“Heaven Knows What,” “Daddy Longlegs”) have a long-standing affinity for characters who test the audience’s patience, who confront the world with their ambitions and nerve endings exposed. Howard might be a distant Jewish cousin of Robert Pattinson’s reckless crook from “Good Time”; he is both a clearly recognizable figure and, in Sandler’s hands, a twitchy, nervy departure. His latest foolhardy scheme rests on those stolen opals, which function on one level as a classic movie MacGuffin — an accursed, much-coveted artifact that rapidly changes hands, sowing confusion and bad blood in its wake. But they also serve to position Howard’s antics in the context of a global industry that thrives on exploitation and vanity, and which draws the attention of tchotchke-seeking celebrities such as Garnett (giving a shrewd, self-effacing performance). There’s some other merchandise in the mix as well — a sports-memorabilia ring, a few hot Rolexes — whose purpose and monetary value can fluctuate as violently as Howard’s moods, whims and circumstances. Howard is thus an avatar of greed, lust, desperation and bravado, a human pinball careening from one bad decision to the next. He’s as flashy and tacky as his wares, with his leather jacket and bad goatee. He’s a faithless husband, a lousy father and a hopeless addict, flushing money away on sports bets and trying to outwit the nasty loan sharks on his tail. For all that, he is hardly the most obnoxious character Sandler has played during his long and lucrative reign as king of the Hollywood idiot comedy. Nor is he the first example of a sharply drawn, painfully human figure to pop up on this actor’s erratic résumé, as admirers of “Punch-Drunk Love” and “The Meyerowitz Stories” will already know. What Howard Ratner may be is the most inescapable of Sandler’s characters — the role it will be hardest for him to top as an actor, and also the one from whom the audience is granted the least physical or psychological distance. The splendidly versatile cinematographer Darius Khondji (“The Lost City of Z,” “Amour”), shooting on gleaming 35-millimeter film, keeps Howard locked in the camera’s sights as he barrels his way forward. The soundtrack is a jittery symphony of wheeling and dealing, cursing and threat making, sometimes exacerbated by the din of radio chatter, agitated smartphones and the live basketball broadcasts whose every twist and turn can send Howard lurching in a new direction. Sandler radiates so much manic, self-destructive energy that the terrific supporting cast can’t help but feed on it. Lakeith Stanfield plays a business associate who hustles and bickers as aggressively as he does, while Julia Fox is especially vivid as Howard’s trusty store clerk, who also happens to be his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Howard pathetically cajoles his estranged and neglected family members, including a soon-to-be-former wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel, as magnificently chilly here as in the “Frozen” movies). Business has a way of mucking up even family occasions, whether it’s a Passover seder (presided over by an excellent Judd Hirsch) or his daughter’s school play. Watching Howard work overtime can be exhausting. Watching Sandler do it is oddly refreshing. In recent studio misfires like “Pixels” or Netflix disposables like “Murder Mystery,” the actor’s familiar shtick has seemed to arise not from a place of gutsy transgressive comedy, but from a zone of laziness and complacency, as if he couldn’t even muster enough energy to laugh his way to the bank. “Uncut Gems” reignites his fires and then some, partly because he’s playing someone so driven, who adores the thrill of the chase and takes an almost sexual ecstasy in every payoff. But it’s also partly because Howard — flamboyant, shameless, loathsome and intermittently lovable — charges so many of Sandler’s familiar expressions and gestures with searing new energy and purpose. There’s the voice that can descend to a gently coaxing tone and then rise to a high-pitched squawk of anger, the attitude that can seem mean and calculating one minute and endearingly dull-witted the next. There is also Sandler’s Jewish American identity, which he has mined for laughs throughout his career and which the directors slyly nudge into both background and foreground. The Safdies sometimes like to play with fire when it comes to race (see “Good Time” — seriously), and in “Uncut Gems,” they seem eager to both court and refute accusations that they’re trafficking in their own culture’s stereotypes. Is Howard Ratner a caricature of the aggressively in-your-face, virulently dishonest Jewish businessman, or does Sandler’s virtuosity render him too singular, too human a creation to be dismissed so reductively? You might as well ask whether, by the end of this invigorating, maddening movie, this impossible tragicomic figure has lost his soul or gained the world.

"Dec 12, 2019"," Uncut Gems begins in the bowels of an Ethiopian diamond mine, a hellish, unforgiving environment where miners’ fingers have literally been worked to the bone. The camera lingers on those wounds, and the cries of the injured men, before zooming in on the ugly oblong treasure they’ve unearthed: a gnarled rock studded with black opals that dazzles on closer look. As the camera closes in, the sparkly image morphs into the depths of the mine and then into an actual human bowel—the footage of a colonoscopy being undergone by the opals’ future owner, Howard Ratner (played by Adam Sandler). That’s the Uncut Gems experience: horrifying, transfixing, and ultimately, to use Tony Kushner’s immortal phrasing, intestinal. That’s also the experience of a Josh and Benny Safdie movie. Beginning with anxiety-inducing micro-budget indies such as Daddy Longlegs (2009), the directing duo have specialized in stories that crackle with the nervy energy of New York’s seedy underbelly. Their previous effort, 2017’s Good Time, threw a big-name star into the mix, conjuring career-best work from Robert Pattinson as a bank robber trying to stay one step ahead of the law. The collaboration with Sandler in Uncut Gems feels even more inspired; though the comic star has been happy to subvert his onscreen image in the past, Howard might be the most fully realized performance he’s ever given. The film is set in a very specific time period—the summer of 2012—and much of its action revolves around a particular NBA playoff game featuring the Boston Celtics. Howard is a Manhattan diamond dealer, a leather-jacket-clad man out of time who presides over a windowless fortress stacked with precious gems, many of them studded into tacky accessories or vintage toys. He has the profane “I’m walkin’ here!” energy of Dustin Hoffman’s Ratso Rizzo, but the New York he inhabits is a far cry from the 1960s world of Midnight Cowboy. Howard is a sultan of crap, a flashy fool who’s nonetheless certain that he’s just one big deal away from hitting the big time. The former Celtics star Kevin Garnett, who plays himself in a fairly substantial supporting role, appears as a symbol of both Howard’s aspirations and his lack of sense. After Garnett sees Howard’s new gemstone-studded rock and becomes entranced by it, Howard happily lends it to him as a good-luck charm for the game, delighted by the clout conferred by such a famous figure. But when he needs to retrieve and sell the rock to settle old debts, Garnett is nowhere to be found, and Howard’s life quickly starts to unravel. Sandler has a skill for manic yelling and comic aggression that he’s used to great effect throughout his career, not only in comedy but also in more serious works, such as Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories. He also possesses a firm grasp on his characters’ defining weaknesses, and Howard’s is that he cannot perceive his own doom even when it’s right in front of him. Howard is convinced that the magic rock filled with opals is going to be his salvation. However, Uncut Gems’ script (written by the Safdies and their longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein) is much more a Shakespearean tragedy than a story of rags-to-riches triumph. Howard’s life is, after all, pretty splendid on the surface. He’s a successful business owner with a lavish suburban home, a beautiful wife (Idina Menzel) and kids, and a devoted mistress (Julia Fox, in an incredible debut). Yet his combination of aggressive neediness and abrasive egotism sets almost everyone against him: His wife is ready to file for divorce; his business partner, Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), cheerfully ignores his calls; and even his bookie (the New York sports-talk-radio legend Mike Francesa) insults him to his face. He’s got an eternal chip on his shoulder and a raging inferiority complex—which is appropriate for Manhattan in the summer of 2012, when the New York Knicks let Jeremy Lin walk to a different team and lost their first chance at lasting relevance in a decade. (Since the Safdies are as die-hard Knicks fans as I am, I have to assume the psychic scars from that summer have lingered.) Howard is a buffoon, but a remarkably compelling one who commands sympathy even as his gambling addiction and refusal to compromise draw him into darker and darker places. The Safdies and the cinematographer Darius Khondji turn New York into a neon-saturated circle of hell that echoes the shape-shifting colonic nightmare of the opening sequence; a pounding electronic score, by Daniel Lopatin, only elevates the tension further. If that makes Uncut Gems sound unpleasant, well, it sometimes is, but the Safdies have a magic touch with unpleasantness. They can find pure human tragedy in the most baroque modern horrors, buried like diamonds within the rock. This is their finest piece of excavation yet.",POSITIVE

"Dec 12, 2019"," The film looks at the high-stakes financial juggle of a pathological gambler. Vague/buried message about valuing what you have instead of reaching for something more. Frequent attack-style fighting includes slapping, punching, biting, shoving, beating. Bleeding limb with bone exposed. Gun violence, extreme close-up of bloody wound. Female character has encounter with real-life music star who keeps sexually pressuring her even though she repeatedly says no (it's not totally clear, but it appears she gives in to his pressure). A sexting woman masturbates and sends photos in revealing lingerie. Several crude comments about sexual intentions. Plot involves a man intending to leave his family for his mistress. Artwork of nude women. Nonstop barrage of cursing, mostly versions of ""f--k"" and frequent uses of the ""N"" word. Also, ""ass,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" ""c-cksucker,"" ""d--k,"" ""goddamnit,"" ""p---y,"" ""skank,"" and ""s--t."" ""Jesus"" and ""oh my God"" as exclamations. Main character is a jeweler and is surrounded by and exchanges expensive chains, rings, watches, diamonds. Pricey steak restaurant Smith & Wollensky; the Ritz-Carlton is mentioned to indicate wealth. Cocaine is snorted on camera by a major music artist who's popular among kids (with no consequences). Characters smoke cigars and cigarettes. Scene at a club where alcohol flows. Beer bottles litter an apartment to indicate there was a party. Parents need to know that Uncut Gems is a dramedy about a shady New York jeweler to rappers and sports stars. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is an unflinching liar, philanderer, and compulsive gambler who abuses the trust of family, friends, colleagues, and customers -- even the famous ones. Basketball star Kevin Garnett and singer The Weeknd play themselves, with the music star taking part in a brief scene where he snorts cocaine and sexually pressures a woman despite her repeated refusal. This same woman is in other sexual situations, including sexting in lingerie and pleasuring herself, and is later called a ""skank"" and ""trash"" by her boyfriend/boss. The dialogue is a blur of profanity (mostly ""f--k"" and the ""N"" word) and lots of yelling. The story is about the pursuit of excessive wealth, but it's not just having money -- rather, the thrill of pulling off a financial ""win."" There's more violence than you might expect, with frequent physical assaults and a brief moment of intense gun violence, as well as a gory wound. Characters smoke and drink frequently. To stay in the loop on more movies like this, you can sign up for weekly Family Movie Night emails. In UNCUT GEMS, New York jeweler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is on the brink of a major windfall, having secured a precious block of rare black opal. He's fully leveraged himself, so he tries to balance collectors, his family, and professional relationships in hopes that his conniving and intuition will result in the ultimate win. Film festival favorites Benny and Josh Safdie place Sandler inside a cacophony of annoyance in this dramedy. Uncut Gems is an assault of the senses: It has a loathsome central character, unsteady camera work, a thunderstorm of profanity/yelling inside a world of antagonistic relationships, and an out-of-place early-'80s synthesizer score. The elements work against each other. The whole movie feels almost like an exercise in seeing how much an audience can tolerate, including how it plays into negative stereotypes. Favors were surely called in to cast key roles, and while former NBA superstar Kevin Garnett comes off just fine playing himself, you have to wonder why The Weeknd would accept a role that shows him snorting coke, pressuring a woman into sex, and getting beaten up by a 48-year-old schlub. Sandler isn't new to playing obnoxious or even objectionable, but he does stretch his chops here, plunking down the kind of ""ugly cry"" rarely seen by men on the big screen. That aside, his character's behavior is such a horror show that he misses the mark. No empathy can be felt for this pathological gambler. Ratner is supposed to be charismatic -- a word easily used for Sandler -- but it's impossible to understand why anyone would trust him, work for him, do business with him, or be his friend. The Safdie brothers add a clever touch, working in a gradual awareness that the film's protagonist is also its antagonist. First, it becomes obvious that Ratner is his own worst enemy. But slowly we realize that Ratner's enemies are actually, in some ways, his victims. It just feels like viewers become victims as well, robbed of more than two hours of their life. Ratner's wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), might as well be speaking for this viewer when she tells her soon-to-be-ex, ""I hate being with you. I hate looking at you. I never want to look at you again."" Amen. Families can talk about gambling. What's the difference between making bets for fun and a compulsion? What are the long-term effects? What does Uncut Gems suggest is the psychological appeal of gambling? What do you think of the filmmakers' use of ""street casting"" (using untrained actors in roles similar to their real selves)? What did you think of how Kevin Garnett and The Weeknd allowed themselves to be portrayed? Why do you think they agreed to do the film?

"Dec 12, 2019"," I’m going to start this review off by saying I originally had no intention of seeing this movie. I am not really an Adam Sandler fan and, unfortunately, hadn’t seen the Safdie brother’s previous films, so UNCUT GEMS didn’t really appeal to me. Admittedly, once some of my favorite critics started heaping praises upon it, I began to get curious, especially when Oscar talk was thrown around for Sandler’s performance. That said, I put aside my feelings and opinions of Sandler and went into UNCUT GEMS with as much of an open mind as possible. Thank God I did because had I not, I would have missed out on one of the best films of the year. The best way to describe UNCUT GEMS is as if someone inserted Adam Sandler with an IV filled with energy pills and let him go wild. The film is a non-stop anxiety trip with brief moments of reprieve that allow for the more humorous moments to shine. Honestly, what people have been saying about Sandler is true: he gives a career-defining performance that is beyond worthy of an Oscar nomination. The film takes viewers on a journey as we come to find out that not only is Howard a big-talking jeweler situated in the Diamond District of New York City, but he also has a penchant for big-time sports gambling. After coming into possession of a rare opal, Howard allows Kevin Garnett to borrow it for his big game with the understanding that he will return it bright and early the following day as it would be going up for auction. However, as with most things, nothing goes as planned, and as Howard races to get the opal returned to him, a duo of hired thugs begins to follow him in order to claim the large debt he owes to their employer. For the next 2+ hours, viewers are left on the edge of their seat as Howard continues to make one mistake after the next while the tension and anxiety surrounding the pacing and tone are ramped up to a heightened 10. As I mentioned, Sandler undoubtedly shines in UNCUT GEMS. It’s almost as if this role was tailored-made specifically for him as he easily, and quite frankly, perfectly, slipped into the role of Howard. He’s sleazy and conniving but at the same time you kind of feel sorry for him. It’s a weird emotion to have considering all the fucked up shit he’s done to get himself where he is, but there’s something undeniably charming about him. Another surprise was Kevin Garnett, playing himself, and to my amazement, his performance was quite good. There’s believability in how he approaches the role where it makes it hard to not accept that this mysterious opal may be the key to helping him win more basketball games. I like that the opal becomes a character itself, encompassing a superstition that Garnett subscribes to, kind of like carrying a rabbit’s foot as a keychain. Only this opal is worth more than most homes instead of a $5 keychain that can be purchased at any gift shop. I also want to remark on Julia Fox‘s performance as Julia. My favorite thing about her storyline was how invested I became even though I wasn’t on-board with her character in the beginning. She, like Howard, is also very flawed but there is a sincerity and genuineness that I think most people would overlook. What I enjoyed so much about Julia and Howard was that even though they were incredibly toxic for each other, they were completely unapologetic in their actions. It doesn’t mean I agreed with their choices but I did envy their ability to not give a single flying fuck about what anyone, outside of each other, thought about them. Aside from the exceptional performances, the story is also superb. Written by Benny and Josh Safdie, along with Ronald Bronstein, they were able to create an original story that trumps much of what has been released in years past. It’s fresh and exciting, something that Hollywood desperately needs. As far as the filmmaking goes, that is a huge proponent as to why the film feels so frenetic and crazy. There’s a hand-held-camera feel which only heightens the more exhilarating moments that are encircled by a feeling of nervous energy. Plus, the film is set and filmed in New York City which is already anxiety-inducing to begin with. Add in Adam Sandler’s Howard screaming into a cellphone (or really anyone within earshot) and that just adds to the overall feeling of nervousness and the desire for a stiff drink (or Xanax). The Safdie Brothers have created a film experience that throws you into the middle of chaos and keeps you pinned there well after the 2-hour run-time has finished. In all, UNCUT GEMS is an electric shock to the movie-goers system that is much needed. It includes award-winning performances and a tight, well-thought-out script that’ll keep you glued to the screen as you watch the unfolding drama take place. Watching what Harold goes through is like watching a car crash – you know you should look away and you are pretty sure it’s not going to end well, but you can’t help but be rooted to your spot with voyeuristic glee. Not only has this film firmly planted itself as one of my top 10 favorite of the year, but it’s also made me want to check out the Safdie Brother’s earlier work, which is a win-win for everyone. If you are looking for a way to mentally check-out of family drama and responsibilities this holiday season, then feign sickness and go see UNCUT GEMS when it’s released in theaters December 13, 2019. Also, be on the lookout for a special diamond-encrusted Furby that you will for sure want as your own.",POSITIVE

"Dec 11, 2019"," A key takeaway from Good Time and Uncut Gems is that I will never turn to the Safdie brothers when I am seeking a relaxing night at the cinema.  Their latest flick is more than just anxiety riddled, it is a god damn nail biter. Along with their fondness of creating the feeling of uncertainty, the siblings seem to have a thing for the sleaze. The focus of Uncut Gems is Howard Ratner, a jewelry store owner in New York City with a magnetic personality. Unfortunately, a run-in with Howard is more trouble than it is worth as this guy is not only surrounded by inconveniences, but creates them too. To know a guy like Howard is a reason to carry a flask of whiskey and ensure you are prescribed to blood pressure medicine.  Howard spends his life living on the edge via gambling. This is not a person that believes in playing it safe, despite nothing ever seeming to go his way. Howard is the epitome of a dumpster fire. Everyone is out to get him (this includes some mafia dudes), he owes money all over town, he might have colon cancer, his marriage is on the rocks and his kids despise him. Regardless, he really doesn’t seem to give a damn. His only concern is the next big score. Similar to Good Time (a wild story of a robbery gone wrong), the world created within Uncut Gems is not one that I enjoy to be in. These are not great people, but they sure as heck are a captivating show to watch. These are stories and characters that I would not have come up with in my wildest dreams. To me, the Safdies are movie magicians as they have the power to bring me into their film. They have the ability to make me genuinely care about characters that I would not have an interest in otherwise. Their filmmaking style and techniques manage to induce a strong reaction. In my film watching scenario of Uncut Gems, I spent the majority of it rocking back n’ forth in my movie seat and drenched in a puddle of sweat. I apologize to my seat mate, Ryan Silberstein. Although, for anyone that knows me personally, this situation is no surprise. My perspiration is no laughing matter and there is much truth when I say that I may have descended from the Creature from the Black Lagoon.  Even with all the angst and nervousness the film may have caused me, there is no doubt that this movie will end up on one of those year-end lists that I painfully force myself to make (*note: nobody wants my rant about year-end lists… or maybe you do?). There is a diamond encrusted Furby for Christ sakes and a basketball player turned actor, Kevin Garnett carrying a gem around with the mindset it has mystical powers. This is a story that one has to see to believe. It goes to those unexpected places and, in the end, you’ll most likely find yourself clamoring for more. It is absolutely wild ride and my only hope is that the Safdies are never tamed. Sorry to break it to the brothers, but they have now set the expectation that every film will be more berserk than the next.  It has been seventeen years since Adam Sandler actually showed up to work. Ya know, that time he punched in to make Punch-Drunk Love. Sandler may have fooled me with The Cobbler but I’m on to him now. For every good flick he makes, he blesses us with dozens of atrocities, but when he is on he is absolutely great. ",POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2019"," Movies often reflect real-life events, societal trends, politics, and more. Sometimes, like a mirror, they do this with surprising immediacy. In other cases, like a shadow, films shortly follow reality’s wake. So it’s no surprise that 2019 gave me some of the most stressful – and rewarding – cinematic experiences of my life. I’m not talking about your standard third act conflict and resolution. I’m talking about movies that made me feel like my knuckles might rip apart as they gripped the armrests. I’m talking about the kind of movies that made me take a long, deep lungful of air upon their conclusion and slowly unwind every tensed muscle in my body. I’m talking about the kind of stressful movies that require a moment of recovery. (Note: When I talk about “stress films” I’m excluding straightforward horror films, specifically because I think there are a lot of terrific, stressful horror films out every year, and this year was no exception.) 
Nothing was a more white-knuckle view for me than Uncut Gems. Uncut Gems stars Adam Sandler as Howard Ratner, a jeweler from New York City with a compulsive gambling addiction and violent loan sharks on his tail. Howard suffers from a misplaced confidence in his bets, including the bets he makes on himself. When he decides to invest in a rare opal smuggled out of an Ethopian mine, Howard gets caught up in a race to appraise and sell the valuable gem while balancing the karmic retribution from friends, family, clients, and – of course – his bankrollers, which comes at him from all sides. Uncut Gems had echoes of other stressful movies like A Serious Man and The Wolf of Wall Street, though neither film achieves the same level of adrenaline. The direction is Scorsese-esque. It often feels like the walls are closing in on Howard, and instead of exiting the room, Howard pushes a button to accelerate the trap. It might sound like something you’d turn away from, but directors Josh and Benny Safdie are so skilled at increasing the stakes, it’s also impossible not to watch. I even found myself unable to blink watching fictional basketball games, which is an incredible feat for someone who can barely raise an eyebrow for the real thing. Uncut Gems easily made my top 10 films of the year, and in spite of how stressful I know I’m making it sound, I even went in for a second viewing. Because beyond the frantic pace, the film has more to offer, exploring the American Jewish identity, the trappings of coveting wealth, and the power of karma. It also contains award-worthy performances from Sandler and his breakout, scene-stealing partner Julia Fox. 1917 felt like a movie that came out of nowhere and landed on everyone’s Best-Of-Year lists and award predictions. Directed by Sam Mendes, 1917 is a World War I journey with the most intense, fast pacing of any war movie I’ve ever seen. There’s a strange irony that war, one of society’s most punishing, cruel, and devastating situations, is also a topic that is prone to making me feel disinterested or unengaged when shown on the big screen. I think that’s at least partially because, much like biopics, many films centered around war tend to follow the same predictable arcs, rhythms, and story beats. These beats can be incredibly effective when they’re original, but the impact fades with each successive version. 1917 upends that formula by applying the pop-culture darling concept of a “long take” shot to the entirety of the film, e.g. a one-shot film. Think of True Detective Season 1’s gripping 6-minute tracking shot from Director Cary Fukunaga, or 2014 film Birdman. 1917 looks like one extended, uninterrupted sequence shot around two soldiers attempting to cross through enemy lines. Starring George McKay and Dean-Charles Chapman as the two unlucky soldiers tasked with the dangerous mission, 1917 follows over the young men’s shoulders, pivots to their sides, and track their every movement over dangerous enemy terrain and their random encounters. 1917 is a technical masterpiece and a shoe-in for a whole host of awards for cinematographer Roger Deakins. But it’s more than just a work of craft. The film uses those technical skills to portray an intense, incredibly immersive experience from the eyes of these two men. You’ll hold your breath when they do, gasp when they do, and jump when they do. 1917 is a beautifully told story with a particularly stand-out performance from McKay, but it also manages to take you on a physical ride alongside its protagonists. It’s a relentless, thrilling mood piece and landed in my second slot in this year’s top 10. Waves is a cleverly-titled film, one that I assume was inspired by the structure and pacing of the film itself. Waves has an intense, cumulative level of chaos and stress in its first half, much like a wave reaching its peak; followed by a quieter, more contemplative second half. I enjoyed both parts, but the second half was an almost necessary salve to the pressure-cooker approach to the first, which I found heart-stopping in its building narrative. If the first half’s pace permeated through the whole film, it might have been one of the most stressful movies of all time. From its very first shot, Waves had me in a constant state of nervous energy and dread. Even something as simple as shots of teenagers riding around in cars had a complex edge that make them feel ominous or foreboding. Set in South Florida, Waves is the story of a family trying to cope with internal and external pressure and stress, as well as tragedy and its aftermath. Anchored by two parallel and incredible performances, Waves offers an all-around impressive ensemble. Kelvin Harrison Jr. stars as Tyler, a black teenager trying to juggle the chaos of home, school, and the future. When things get difficult on all fronts – from his overbearing father, to girlfriend issues, to sports injuries – Tyler starts to collapse under the weight of it all. [Note: Harrison Jr. took the Atlanta Film Critics Circle’s 2019 prize for breakthrough performance, for his work both here and in Luce, which also deals with the inordinate pressure placed on young black men in the United States.] After the wave breaks, it ebbs, which is where we get another breakout performance from Taylor Russell as Tyler’s sister Emily, who mostly stands in Tyler’s shadow and copes with his actions. These were my three most stressful cinematic experiences, but 2019 had plenty more to offer. In addition to horror offerings like Midsommar, Us, and The Lighthouse, anxiety permeated movies across the board. From Netflix’s drama Marriage Story to my favorite movie of the year, Parasite (which had just enough dark humor to keep it off my top 3 most anxious experiences), to films I liked less but can still acknowledge for their mood work, such as Climax and Joker, it was hard to escape. What else did I miss? Let me know in the comments.",POSITIVE
"Dec 11, 2019"," Adam Sandler is Hollywood’s biggest contradiction. Though  his comedies range from pretty good (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore) to god-awful (Grown Ups, Jack and Jill), they have amassed more than $3 billion at the box office. The SNL-alum-turned-production-tycoon got rich by repeating himself. See (or don’t) his Netflix hit Murder Mystery — it’s comic laziness incarnate. And then there’s the other Adam Sandler, the actor who makes fools of his detractors. In the annals of the Golden Raspberrys — think the Oscars but for gross cinematic incompetence — only Sly Stallone has more wins than Sandler’s nine. But what about the guy who had critics raving in Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love (2002)? Or the performer who went above and beyond the call of duty in James L. Brooks’ Spanglish (2004), Judd Apatow’s Funny People (2009), and especially Noah Baumbach’s The Meyerowitz Stories (2017)? Oscar voters pretend not to see that Sandler’s a clown who can, almost by an act of will, stand toe-to-toe with the best we’ve got. Shame on them if they snub the performance that the actor delivers in Uncut Gems, a potent study of a man coming unglued that plays like a white-knuckle thriller. Sandler is Howard Ratner, a jewelry-store owner in New York’s Diamond District circa 2012 who runs his business like a gambling junkie, thriving on the rush and hot for a new score that might lose him everything. And the deeper Howard goes, the louder Sandler’s howling, adrenalized roar builds. He could not have found better collaborators than the Safdie brothers, Josh and Benny, sibling directors who are incendiary talents. Their four previous indie features (notably 2017’s Good Time, with Robert Pattinson) have prepped them for their most personal film yet. As Syrian Jews whose father worked in the Diamond District, the Safdies feel this movie in their bones, casting nonactors off those streets to work with the pros in order to achieve raw, riveting authenticity. Sandler catches that vibe and runs with it, as Howard is pushed up against walls and into tight corners. The breakneck script that the Safdies wrote with Ronald Bronstein believes in defaulting to shouts when there’s something to say. Shot on the move by the superb veteran cinematographer Darius Khondji (Seven, Midnight in Paris, The Immigrant) and scored by Daniel Lopatin, Uncut Gems does not let up. Every second in this movie pops, starting with opening on a black opal being mined in Ethiopia (social criticism intended) and working its way to Howard’s store. The stone, which is said to be worth a million, should be Howard’s way out of a debt he owes to his brother-in-law Arno (Eric Bogosian), a nasty sleaze not given to family loyalty. Neither is Howard’s about-to-be ex-wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), whose irritations extend to Julia (dynamite newcomer Julia Fox), the store clerk Howard is screwing around with on the side. You think his day job is hectic? Try taking a look at his personal life. For Howard, however, the opal is not a solution but a means to an end. The minute his pal Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) shows up at the store with then-active Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett (in a killer spin on himself), Howard agrees to lend him the gem as a good-luck charm. Why? Because Howard  thinks it’ll give a karmic edge to the Celtics game he’s betting on. This leads to the film’s extended climax, a sequence of such profound, palm-sweating tension that you may have to catch your breath. We’ve already watched Howard take his lumps when debt collectors beat him senseless, took his clothes, and locked him in the trunk of a car parked outside his daughter’s school. But that’s nothing compared to the crisis in Howard’s store when he barricades Arno  and his henchman Phil (a truly scary Keith Williams Richards) in the store’s glassed-in security enclosure in full view of Howard, now glued to the TV, doing a  frenzied play-by-play of the hoops game that can save his life or end it. Howard is a beast of a role, and the Safdies spotlight Sandler meeting every challenge.",POSITIVE
"Dec 10, 2019","  Adam Sandler works and works, making one movie a year when he isn’t making three. Quantity sure isn’t quality, though the diamonds sparkle. Take Uncut Gems, a vibrantly madcap dark comedy. As jeweler Howard Ratner, Sandler rocks shiny earrings and shinier glasses, plus gleaming teeth and circular facial hair. He looks like a midlife crisis, and the overkill extends to his constant salesman chatter.
  Howard owes money all over New York. At least one debt could turn fatal. Salvation rests in an Ethiopian opal, which arrives in his Diamond District shop the same moment as the NBA’s Kevin Garnett (charmingly playing himself). Howard thinks he can score big off the rock and the baller, but the spiraling story line carries him from bad to worse. His wife (Idina Menzel) wants him out. His girlfriend (Julia Fox) just went into the bathroom with the Weeknd. To cover all the losses he can’t afford, he keeps betting cash he doesn’t have. The first time we see Howard, he’s mid-colonoscopy. That’s as comfortable as he’ll ever get.
  The directors are Josh and Benny Safdie, the thrilling filmmakers behind 2017’s insidiously fun Good Time. Uncut Gems is a visible Hollywoodification of the earlier film’s druggy-tense kineticism. It’s overstuffed with ace cast members like Menzel and Lakeith Stanfield, who don’t have enough to do. And where Good Time zigzagged all over the city with maniacally sleepless energy, Uncut Gems eventually leans into the format of a faintly neo-religious fable. Howard joins his family for a standout sequence at Passover seder, and there’s a plagues-of-Egypt quality to how his problems keep piling up.

"Dec 10, 2019"," Back in September, paparazzi images of Adam Sandler surfaced. His look was a far cry from his usual overgrown dude-bro outfits of basketball shorts and baggy T-shirts. Instead, he was wearing a mustard-hued shirt with a black collar, a worn-in, slightly oversized leather jacket, and large dress pants that were hiked up just below his gut; his accessories included rimless glasses with lenses the size of teaspoons, a lone diamond earring, and a gold Star of David pinkie ring. His shoes were a rounded toe with Ferragamo double-horseshoe hardware. (There was even a matching belt.) While he was jabbering on the phone, his mouth was curved into an ever-so-slightly pervy grin. The images circulated as memes and as Instagram Stories: What the hell was happening to Mr. Sandler? It was later revealed that Sandler was in character, playing Howard Ratner in brothers Benny and Joshua Safdie’s latest film, Uncut Gems. (The same two brothers filmed the grit-tastic film Good Time.) Howard—or “Howie,” as he is endearingly referred to as by his side piece—would be a first-generation Russian diamond dealer with a Bukharian (a Jew from Bukhara, Uzbekistan) wife living in a McMansion in Long Island. Uncut Gems is a transfixing film, firstly because the pace of it is so fast it’s almost nauseating, like having an IV full of Red Bull nailed into your aorta. The rapid jumps from scene to scene are underscored by frantic, never-ending percussion. This head-spinning effect is exacerbated thanks to Sandler’s performance as Howard, a fast-talking, scheming Jewish diamond dealer who pulls fast ones, like placing out-of-control bets and pawning off other people’s jewelry for a short-term loan. Set in 2012, the plot revolves around Howard’s own treasure: a hulking black opal unearthed by Ethiopian miners that he later tries to sell to the Celtic’s Kevin Garnett. Many hopes and dreams are invested into this one glimmering stone. Howard tells Garnett a story about how Ethiopia has its own Jews; how the stone is the rarest of the rare! All this yada yada—the whole megillah of loudmouth quasi-lies—just keep on streaming. Nonetheless, Garnett is hypnotized by what the stone possesses while Howard is hypnotized by convincing himself of his own story. The story unfolds and, as it does, we meet Howard and his family (his wife is played by Idina Menzel), his colleagues, and his mistress (played by Julia Fox). The film’s costuming is equally transfixing. Throughout the film, Howard is a lovable parasite; you want to hate him, but after spending so much time in his presence, he slowly grows on you. In his own strange way, he even becomes somewhat charming. His clothes, appropriately, match that sentiment. It’s endearing schmuck style at its finest: It’s gaudy. It’s flashy. It’s even kind of nasty. There are designer shirts—new with tags still on—that he flings around his office. He is dressed in every mid-tier luxury label one can think of. (Hugo Boss! Ferragamo!) The result is tasteless but dollar-pumped. Howie has the cash, so he buys what he wants. He’s like a baby gravitating towards something shiny, and the result is deliciously foul. It’s a car-wreck wardrobe made up of clueless sleaze and cash bands, and I couldn’t look away. Howard’s genius wardrobe was created by costume designer and stylist Miyako Bellizzi, along with consultant and fashion mensch Mordechai Rubinstein. (Both had previously worked on the Safdies’ film Good Time.) The two spent months researching what Howard would wear, hunkering down in the diamond district, interviewing dealers and visiting their homes to view their closets. (Throughout the film, there are cameos from real diamond dealers in their own wardrobes of Versace shirts and whatever-luxury-designer logo tops.) According to Bellizzi, Howard’s character is a composite of three of these dealers. One of those on the mood board was the famed Jacob the Jeweler (Jacob Arabo), a Bukharian diamond dealer who wheeled and dealed all things blingy for celebrities and rappers. In 2002, he was arrested for aiding a narcotics ring. Arabo was shiny, tanned, and always in a suit—like Miami Vice came with a tie and landed in midtown Manhattan. While Howard doesn’t have the same suited-and-booted appeal as Jacob the Jeweler, he has his own ways of showing off his hard-earned moolah. The most important staple of the film is his Hugo Boss leather jacket, a piece that he wears for most of the film’s running time. “We found a few on eBay. It had to be the right one. It had to be worn in, it had to be oversized, we wanted it to be that he had for 10 or 20 years: he’s gained weight; he’s lost weight. It is his favorite sport coat,” says Bellizzi. There’s also the opening scene that shows Howard in a yellow shirt from Theory. “It’s so thin, you can kind of see his nipples through it,” Bellizzi adds, while Rubinstein simply calls it “disgusting.” Another important piece of imagery are his rimless glasses, which are modeled after the Cartier styles that dealers actually wear. “When he wore them, we wanted him to transform,” says Bellizzi. Those new-with-tags shirts being thrown around his office? Bellizzi and Rubinstein note that many dealers have extra shirts in their office because local vendors, on foot, stop by offices on 47th Street to sell them. Howard’s awkward look feels so hypnotic because it’s real, and Bellizzi and Rubinstein went to painstaking lengths to achieve the effect, whether that was trawling resale sites or brick-and-mortar stores. “The pants are Zegna,  double-pleated way up high the whole movie,” says Rubinstein. “The shirt [from Theory] is from Century 21.” (How more real can you get than Century 21, the cross-cultural confluence of hectic discount shopping?) One poignant sleeper scene is when Howie’s try-hard wardrobe falls flat. He enters a club in an oversized, untucked pink shirt the color of Bubble Yum gum. To perfect the look, Bellizzi and Rubinstein looked through images of old club photos. “You think about 1 OAK in 2012. I’ve been, and I remember going and [seeing] the guys that come in with their button-down shirts and the square-toe shoe that sticks up in the front and their chest are out,” says Rubinstein. “We bought 100 pink shirts and they were like, ‘No, no, no. It needs to look silky.’ I was like, ‘No, that’s not silk, that is shvitz from the end of the night with bottles sprayed on him.’ We eventually got this Egyptian cotton that I bought from the fabric shop that was made by this guy I know on 5th Avenue. It is incredible with this high, high collar with double buttons.” It is the brightest garment in his wardrobe, and yet he almost seems to fade into the crowd while wearing it. His look becomes glaringly irrelevant, his attempt to fit in and know what is hip falls flat, and you can’t help but feel for him. What is most mystifying about Howard is that his style doesn’t have any firm point of view, except to reflect his wealth. Then again, wealth and the pursuit of pretty things is why he doesn’t show allegiance to really anyone, not his wife, and not even a basketball team. (In this scenario, cheating on your wife feels forgivable; switching sides for a basketball team is not.) These idiosyncrasies are all evident in his wardrobe. In one scene, he wears two basketball championship rings: one from the Knicks and the other a Celtics ring, collateral from Garnett himself. Who wears two championship rings at the same time from two opposing teams? In general, a New Yorker with a Boston Celtics ring seems absurd. It feels sacrilegious—but that is the beauty about Howard. Howie is absurd, and so is his collection of ugly, expensive clothes. Sure, his look can be viewed as money-hungry, soulless, and empty. He has, after all, a vaguely Trumpian way of understanding wealth: It has to be broadcasted, which is obnoxious by default. And yet somehow, Howie, with all of his flaws and his flawed wardrobe, is just like the rest of us: He wants to achieve what he views as the American Dream by any means necessary, even if he takes that to its very extreme. Howie wants to fit in and get a piece of the pie, but all while wearing a big ole Hugo Boss jacket and a mustard-hued shirt. He’s a man set in his ways. You hate to love it.

"Dec 10, 2019"," Uncut Gems is the new film from the Safdie brothers starring Adam Sandler, Eric Bogosian, Idina Menzel, Lakeith Stanfield and NBA basketball star Kevin Garnett. It tells the story of Howard Ratner (Sandler), a Long Island jeweler with a very intense gambling addiction. He’s trying to find his next big score, spreading himself too thin and facing some dire consequences as a result. He thinks he’s found said score in a giant uncut black opal smuggled to him (in the guts of a fish) from the mines in Ethiopia. The seedy crime thriller turns into a game of “chase the opal” after he lends it to Kevin Garnett and his pal Demany (LaKeith Stanfield). Howard is on a dangerous highwire act, not just walking the thin line between success and disaster, but having to keep the various plates he’s juggling (work, family, loan sharks, mistresses) from crashing down until the opal gets on the auction block. He owes a large amount of money to his brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian), who has thugs tailing him and threatening grievous bodily harm. Garnett doesn’t want to give back the opal because he thinks it is the mystical key to him winning the championship. His wife (Idina Menzel) wants to tell their family about the impending divorce. And his mistress … Well, she just wants to make money and maybe sleep with The Weeknd. Is that so much to ask? The tension created by the pacing and editing is truly incredible. It feels like a two hour and fifteen minute panic attack – but in the best possible way. Each impulsive decision Howard makes ratchets up the intensity and anxiety for the audience, but is cleverly offset by moments of strategic comedic relief. The laughter escapes like steam shooting out of a pressure cooker. Even the opening credit sequence, in which you are taken from the kaleidoscopic insides of the black opal into Adam Sandler’s colon (Howard is undergoing a colonoscopy at the beginning of the film) and out the other end. You know the old joke about someone being so tense they could shit diamonds? Well the dang Safdie brothers tell us right from the very beginning that this movie is going to have us… excreting opals. The cast is stellar. This is Sandler’s best work since Punch Drunk Love. Kevin Garnett is hilarious as himself and has excellent comedic timing. Bogosian and Menzel are both fantastic, though I do wish we got more Menzel time because I love her but I guess I will have to let it go (SORRY NOT SORRY FOR THE FROZEN JOKE). Julia Fox is also incredibly good as the flaky, gold digging girlfriend. But a special shout out must be given to the real break out star of Uncut Gems – Adam Sandler’s top dentures. They are a disgusting, unsettling masterpiece, and they deserve their own award. Thematically, Uncut Gems is a cautionary tale about the dangers of addiction. It really nails home the physical perils of being addicted to gambling, not just for the addict, but their family and co-workers as well. And Howard is in the full throws of it. It is physically painful at times to watch him continue to make the worst, most impulsive decisions. His plans, and lies, grow exponentially more complicated and intricate with each new bet. Eventually he has dug himself a hole that seems impossible to climb out of. Culminating in an ending that, without spoiling it, literally made me scream. The Safdie Brothers have truly cemented their title as the ultimate Dirtbag Auteurs. From Good Time, starring Robert Pattinson and Benny Safdie as low-level thug brothers, to Uncut Gems – no one shows the full scope of the humanity of scumbags like the Safdies. Though it’s interesting to note the difference between the two films. In Good Time, the events of the film are driven by Pattinson’s need to protect his mentally disabled brother and keep him out of jail, ultimately sacrificing his own freedom in the process. It’s a film that, despite its seediness, is about the importance of love, family, and loyalty. Uncut Gems, however, is the opposite side of the dirtbag coin. Howard is loyal only to himself and his addiction. He wants the love and respect of his family and girlfriend but he’s a vacuum, constantly sucking in whatever he can get, and only returning his affections when it furthers his own needs and desires. He’s a ridiculous clown, but the film is constantly reminding the audience that he is an extremely dangerous one. His buffoonery has dire consequences for the people in his immediate proximity. And while this might feel dark and depressing, the whole experience of the film felt almost like an exorcism. The building panic and tension releasing in a cathartic explosion that left me feeling not just relieved but actually kind of pumped? Maybe that speaks more to my own mental health quirks, but regardless, Uncut Gems is worth a watch.",POSITIVE
"Dec 10, 2019"," The opal-studded rock that circulates among several characters in Uncut Gems, Benny and Josh Safdie’s nerve-jangling portrait of a jewelry dealer in self-destructive free-fall, doesn’t look like much from a distance. It’s a gray blob the texture of concrete and roughly the size and shape of a potato, inlaid here and there with spots of glossy smoothness. Only when you look up close, preferably through a jeweler’s loupe, can you make out the ever-shifting rainbow of colors inside this rare hunk of stone, a black opal illegally smuggled from Ethiopia inside a shipment of fish.* Still, at least two characters in Uncut Gems see more than a valuable mineral deposit. For Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), the manic proprietor of a jewelry store in Manhattan’s Diamond District, the newly acquired rock represents a chance to finally get out from under the gambling debts that have him on the run from two separate sets of angry creditors and their accompanying hired muscle. Kevin Garnett, the retired Boston Celtics star who plays himself in 2012 (hence still a pro athlete at the top of his game), visits Howard’s store on a pregame shopping spree and takes a superstitious shine to the glowing rock. Garnett has a hunch it will bring him luck in that night’s game—and the risk-addicted, basketball-mad Howard, in an early display of his gift for making the exact wrong choice in every situation, allows Garnett to borrow the rock for the night and leave his NBA championship ring as collateral. That poor decision on Howard’s part leads to a cascade of worse ones. He pawns the ring, then uses the money to bet big on that night’s Celtics game. Within 24 hours, Howard is in trouble with a whole new set of people, including his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), who’s so disgusted with his compulsive gambling and checked-out parenting of their three kids that she’s pressing him to move forward with divorce plans. Then there’s his mistress (Julia Fox), an employee at the jewelry shop whom he maintains in an apartment of her own: After he catches her in the bathroom of a club flirting with the bad-boy singer the Weeknd (also appearing as himself), their every encounter devolves into an operatic screaming match. Then again, most conversations in Howard’s world are operatic screaming matches, conducted over the competing noise of overlapping background dialogue, the incessant buzzing of the locked bulletproof glass door that leads into the shop, and an ambient—perhaps too ambient, as in omnipresent—electronic score by Daniel Lopatin, who composes under the name Oneohtrix Point Never. “I think you are the most annoying person I have ever met,” Dinah tells her husband at one point, in a tone utterly devoid of spousal affection. “I hate being with you, I hate looking at you, and if I had my way, I would never see you again.” Whether or not you agree with her may determine how you come out feeling about Uncut Gems, an abrasive movie about an abrasive man. At times, especially in the scenes involving Howard’s family life, his level of daily dysfunction has a slapstick side: At a performance of his daughter’s high school play, for example, an encounter with hired thugs leaves him naked and locked in his own car trunk. But as he gets deeper into trouble with an ever-widening group of enemies, the movie’s tone darkens, ending in a hostage situation at the jewelry store that recalls the gang-who-couldn’t-shoot-straight standoff of Sidney Lumet’s Dog Day Afternoon. (Lumet, who specialized in character portraits of desperate misfits struggling to survive on the streets of a crime-ridden New York, has long been a point of reference for the Safdies, whose earlier movies also include the semi-autobiographical family drama Daddy Longlegs and the junkie romance Heaven Knows What.) Uncut Gems is a movie that has no problem sacrificing character development or storytelling logic for mood, and that mood, as was the case with the Safdies’ 2017 crime thriller Good Time, is unrelentingly intense, frantic, and ragged-edged. It’s as if the directors, who co-wrote the script with longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein, are aiming to reproduce in the viewer a sense of the enormous emotional toll it must take to be around—or, more exhausting still, to be—a black hole of need like the infinitely self-sabotaging Howard. There’s something to admire in the pedal-to-the-metal commitment of their project, and certainly Uncut Gems is the product of an uncompromising vision. But I found the result to be claustrophobic and, finally, dull, with scene after scene that hammers home the same point we understood from the very beginning: that Howard is a lost soul, fated to run both his business and personal life into the ground. The brothers elicit memorable performances from supporting actors like Lakeith Stanfield, who plays a freelance hustler who rounds up high rollers like Garnett and his entourage to patronize Howard’s store in exchange for a cut of the profits. In her film debut, Fox, previously best known as a downtown Manhattan party personality, stands out in an underwritten role as Howard’s kept girlfriend, who at first seems to be an emotionally remote call girl but who turns out in the movie’s last half—and rather improbably, given Howard’s nonstop bad behavior—to be in love with him. And a grizzled Eric Bogosian plays Howard’s brother-in-law, who’s both ruthlessly intent on getting back the money Howard owes him and oddly awed by the luckless jeweler’s endless willingness to up the ante of danger in exchange for that next big score. Sandler is being widely praised for his performance as the grating, grasping, yet somehow pitiable Howard. It’s certainly hard to imagine any other actor who could pull off the role, but it’s also not news that the former Billy Madison can act: Between Punch-Drunk Love, Funny People, and The Meyerowitz Stories, among many others, he’s been playing dramatic characters, many of them with a similarly obnoxious edge, for going on two decades. The Safdies, too, are exploring territory we’ve seen them map out before, albeit this time on a larger scale. There is one image from the film that will stay with me, though: In the opening and closing shots, the jittery hand-held camera (the cinematographer is the legendary Darius Khondji) moves inside the stone named in the title, exploring the opals’ microscopic crystalline structure in trippy psychedelic color. This journey into the rock, in both cases, is linked to a Fantastic Voyage–style trip inside the protagonist’s body. It’s a bold visual metaphor that suggests some kind of mystical connection between the rare stone’s beauty and Howard’s insatiable need to possess, and eventually destroy, everything he loves—and that, unlike much of the rest of this movie, left me thinking, “I wonder what that means,” rather than “Fine, we get it already.”",NEGATIVE
"Dec 10, 2019","Adam Sandler deserves an Oscar for his riveting performance in ""Uncut Gems."" He's absolutely brilliant here.",POSITIVE
"Dec 10, 2019"," In 1992, Abel Ferrara directed Bad Lieutenant, a film in which a crooked NYPD cop played by Harvey Keitel smokes crack, sexually assaults teenagers, and gambles on baseball while trying to solve the rape of a nun. The film became a punk cinema classic of New York scum and set a standard in which Harvey Keitel demanded to be filmed fully nude in all subsequent roles. Uncut Gems, the new film from Benjamin and Joshua Safdie — aka the Safdie Brothers — (who previously gave us a manic Robert Pattinson in Good Times) is a spiritual heir to Bad Lieutenant that somehow manages to give us all the unhinged, life-on-the-edge energy of the original with little of the sensationalism. No one needs to rape a nun or smoke crack for Uncut Gems to give you a panic attack. It thrums with the kind of underworld energy and sketchy hustle that most people assumed died in the early Giuliani era. Anchoring the whole thing is, of all people, Adam Sandler. It’s a remarkable work of feral filmmaking that makes everything else feel domesticated by comparison. Leave it to the Safdie Brothers — (and their long-time collaborator, Ronald Bronstein, credited as co-writer) to rediscover New York’s dangerous side. They famously shot Heaven Knows What guerilla-style while one of their lead actors was technically a fugitive. In Uncut Gems, Sandler pays Howard Ratner, a character apparently inspired by the Safdies’ eccentric Syrian-Jewish father’s time as a jewel runner in New York City’s diamond district. Ratner is trying to run his bling business (he has one necklace featuring a diamond-encrusted Gizmo from Gremlins and another with Michael Jackson posed on a crucifix) while heading two households: one with his wife and kids, the other with his scenester mistress. Naturally, he owes money all over town. His various creditors keep showing up unannounced, screwing up other “business opportunities” and occasionally roughing him up, including a pair of Extremely Serious-Looking Mob Dudes, played by Keith Williams Richards and Tommy Kominik. Among other things, the Safdies have a rare gift for terrifyingly authentic casting.  At the center of it all is a rare black opal Howard has acquired from Ethiopia that Kevin Garnett comes to believe has magical powers. Oh yeah, ex-NBA star Kevin Garnett is in this too — playing himself. As is The Weeknd, who Howard’s mistress, Julia (played by Julia Fox) apparently has a thing for, much to Howard’s chagrin. Through it all, Howard is a manic, unsettling personality who never quits while he’s ahead and never leaves well enough alone. He can’t. Any time he senses an opportunity he doubles and triples down, even if it means leveraging himself to the hilt to do so. “If you ain’t gambling, you ain’t living,” seems to be his basic worldview. Thanks to his lifestyle, he’s constantly surrounded by flakes, fakes, schemers, and ruthless predators, including his would-be middleman to the sports world, Demany (a perfect as always Lakeith Stanfield) and his creditor/relative, Arno (Eric Bogosian). Having to explain to his wife (Idina Menzel) how he ended up naked inside his own car trunk at his daughter’s recital is just part of doing business. It’s the juxtaposition of the mundane and the life-and-death in Howard’s life that makes Uncut Gems so compelling, a rare combination of breathtakingly intense and wickedly funny. Like having to explain why he resurfaced his pool to some giant goombahs who might bury him alive. It’s likewise a contrast of well-known people like Sandler and Garnett playing against type and intensely authentic character actors playing what seem like the only roles someone with their personae could play. A guy like Keith Williams Richards streamlines the writing process. His backstory is written right on his face.  All the while, the Safdies’ shooting style — jittery, almost fidgeting camera work, combined with cacophonous, overlapping dialogue like working-class David Mamet — have the same effect as Howard’s disquieting persona: constant fight-or-flight. You never get to catch your breath. Watching Uncut Gems is a little like having your adrenal glands milked for two hours.  Yet the Safdie Brothers’ goal seems larger than mere provocation, which is what makes Uncut Gems a great movie rather than a merely good one. Kevin Garnett keeps hassling Howard to get him to admit how much he paid the Ethiopians for his stone versus how much he ended up selling it for, and badgering him about why he had to try to make a big score instead of just paying them a fairer price and making a modest profit. Howard asks, “I’ve seen you play. Why don’t you just stop scoring when you’re up by 20 in the playoffs? I’m not an athlete, this is my sport. I do it for the same reason you do,” he says. That is, he tries to maximize profit as a fuck you to anyone who doubted him. To anyone that needs to hear it, really. It’s proof of his self-worth. It’s a self-serving explanation, of course, but it says a lot about Howard and people like him, and it gets to the root of what makes him.  For as much as Uncut Gems is a worthy successor to Bad Lieutenant in terms of adrenaline, constant danger, and the thrill of sports gambling (it’s weird to find yourself pumping your fists to NBA playoff footage from 2012 just because a movie character bet on it), in some ways it’s a more complete movie. The Safdies have an affinity, affection, and insight into their protagonist that make their film more than just a cinematic snort of cocaine. Which isn’t to say that Uncut Gems doesn’t work perfectly well as cinematic cocaine.",POSITIVE
"Dec 9, 2019"," Adam Sandler’s frantic and fidgety performance as Howard Ratner, a diamond-district jewelry dealer scrambling to stave off calamity, provides the emotional backbone for the brothers Josh and Benny Safdie’s recklessly audacious and wildly accomplished blend of crime thriller, family melodrama, and sports drama. Howard, a compulsive gambler, is deep in debt to loan sharks, one of whom (Eric Bogosian) is menacingly insistent. Howard has left his exasperated wife (Idina Menzel) for his employee (Julia Fox) and is trying to set the whole mess aright with the sale of a smuggled stone, in which a distinguished client, the professional basketball player Kevin Garnett (playing himself), takes an interest. The supercharged action—from a script by the Safdies and Ronald Bronstein—ingeniously intertwines real-world sporting events and real-life characters (including the Weeknd) with sharp-eyed scenes from the high-pressure gemstone business, the gambler’s tightrope walk, and the habits and rituals of suburban Jewish New Yorkers.

"Dec 9, 2019"," So sobs Howard, the adrenaline-junkie diamond dealer gambling addict played by Adam Sandler in ""Uncut Gems."" Taking place over the course of a couple of days, ""Uncut Gems,"" directed by Josh and Benny Safdie, hurtles along a narrow track over a yawning abyss, following Howard as he attempts to pay down his huge gambling debts by, of course, placing increasingly risky bets. There's the hope that once he pays it all off, he'll wipe the slate clean, and repair some of the bridges he's burned. But everyone around Howard knows this is a fantasy. His addiction is too entrenched. The dazzle of the ""uncut gems"" in the title is not a surface shine. It glows at the center of the earth, it burns in Howard's core. It makes sense, then, that ""Uncut Gems"" would start with a sequence where the camera goes inside a black opal (dug out of the Welo opal mines in northern Ethiopia) which then morphs into the inside of a human colon. The colon of Howard, to be exact, as he endures a colonoscopy. The images on the hospital monitor look similar to the fantastical space of the opal's innards, its curves and layers. This is metaphor writ so large it's brazen, a theme hammered home with refreshing rhetorical candor. The opal is inside Howard, his need for it comes from the basest part of him. He lives in a state of ""gold sickness"" or ""dragon sickness"" (so vividly described by J.R.R. Tolkien in The Hobbit), the hypnotic power of gems luring men into madness since the beginning of time, seeking pirate's gold, El Dorado, the Holy Grail, on doomed colonialist adventures. Howard's black opal is the same as any long-besought gem: it emanates a magical pull on all who look upon it. Its power is almost wholly symbolic. Co-written by the Safdies and regular collaborator Ronald Bronstein, ""Uncut Gems"" immerses you in Howard's nutty cacophonous world. Howard's jewelry shop in New York's Diamond District is a tiny space with the atmosphere of a three-ring circus. The double entrance to his shop—requiring two buzzes—is a buffer between Howard and the world, giving him (at the most) 10 seconds lead time against anyone looking for him. His assistant Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) hustles clients who might be interested in the flashy items in Howard's inventory, and the latest lure is Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett (playing himself), waiting in the shop when Howard returns from the colonoscopy. Howard can't resist showing Garnett his latest acquisition: the opal, just arrived from Ethiopia, which Howard is putting it up for auction later in the week (at a hugely inflated price). He tells Garnett about how he feels connected to the Ethiopian Jews who dig up the opals, and his enthusiasm is so passionate it's catching. Garnett asks if he could borrow the opal for good luck at the upcoming Eastern Conference finals, and Howard says yes. Howard saying ""yes"" is the first of the many, many terrible choices he makes over the next 135 minutes. He owes so much money that goons follow him around, showing up at his office. These people mean business. His wife (Idina Menzel) seethes with hatred for him. His daughter can barely tolerate him. He's put up his young mistress (Julia Fox) in an apartment he's rented for her. Howard is always on the go, always running out of rooms, racing down sidewalks, charging across lobbies. And that's the thing about addiction, the thing that ""Uncut Gems"" really understands. On some level, the stress is the point. The nerve endings are so frayed they need the stress. Howard is useless without panic. So is his mistress, who also suffers from a form of ""gold sickness.” It is their main bond. This is not a ""cautionary tale"" about the dangers of gambling. It's more like a virtual-reality game where you step into Howard's experience. The Safdies use New York City in ways that haven't been seen since films in the '70s. The city has been so cleaned up and gentrified and homogenized it might be easy to forget that so much goes on at street-level, so much chaos, the marginalized and lost seeking a foothold, the grifters and hustlers slipping through the cracks, working their angles. The Safdies' ""Heaven Knows What"" was documentary-like in its approach, but their follow-up ""Good Time"" was a race-against-the-clock thriller, its action sprawling over the five boroughs. The Safdies are nervy, funny, and comfortable with discomfort. Their characters have no access to comfort, and yet in every moment they're striving to escape, hustle, talk their way out of things, talk their way into things, get what they need, what they want. Veteran cinematographer Darius Khondji (a changeup from the Safdies' regular collaboration with Sean Price Williams) brings out the sickly gleam in this world, the green-fuzz of the interior lighting, the glamour of some of the interiors juxtaposed with the sleaze of the others. In a recent conversation between Adam Sandler and Brad Pitt for Variety's Actors on Actors series, Pitt observed that even though Howard makes all these bad choices in ""Uncut Gems,"" you worry about the guy. It is Pitt's contention that this is because of Sandler's ""warm-heartedness,"" something you always feel, no matter the material. I think there's something to that. You hear people expressing surprise when Sandler gives a good performance. There should be no surprise. When he's given good material, like Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Punch Drunk Love,"" or Noah Baumbach's ""The Meyerowitz Stories"" (to name just a few), he's as good as it gets. Behind his humor is pain and rage, both of which he is able to tap into. Here, as Howard, complete with goatee, fancy glasses, ""club"" clothes, he is a portrait of a man living on the edge. He never stops talking. He never stops striving, scheming, shouting, hustling. In his eyes is the devotional gleam of the big score. ""Self-delusion"" is a redundant term. All delusions come from a willingness to buy into a fantasy, an off-chance, a long shot. In a delusion, your brain is a cage, and you are your own prison guard, monitoring the perimeters of allowable thought. Delusion feeds addiction, and addiction needs a constant supply of delusion. ""Uncut Gems"" shows this electrified-fence feedback loop like no other film in recent memory. It's excruciating and exhilarating.

"Dec 8, 2019"," One-sentence review: Uncut Gems is a non-stop, heart-pounding adreneline rush of a crime movie — sometimes to a fault — with a career-best performance by Adam Sandler.  Josh and Benny Safdie — better known as the Safdie Brothers — have a penchant for movies that leave you little time to breathe. With Good Time, their best film and Robert Pattinson’s best performance to date, they created a bank heist that set off a chain of events that tumble into a cycle of close calls and cons all taking place in one night. It’s almost as if the Safdie’s created the narrative with the direction that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Thankfully, they centered that movie on a character that thrives on situations that need to be navigated. It’s the reason it works so well. Similarly, they center their latest movie, Uncut Gems — which was the secret screening at this year’s New York Film Festival — on Adam Sandler’s singular Howard Ratner, a diamond-dealer with a heavy propensity to gamble. He’s the perfect character to study in the situation they put him in. Like Good Time, they pick a single direction for the narrative: Howard always makes the wrong decision. A lot of that is due to his deep addiction to gambling, which has driven him into a deeper and deeper hole of debt, which he fills with more debt. He has a seemingly endless barrage of mobsters and bookies knocking on his door — including his brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian). So, when he gets the opportunity to use New York Knicks player Kevin Garnett’s championship ring as collateral for a loan, he takes it. You see, Garnett has become transfixed by a rare opal stone that Howard has recently acquired — he’s planning on selling it through an auction — and asks to take it as a good luck charm for a forthcoming game. However, when Garnett doesn’t return the gem, Howard must find a way to: get the gem back in time for the auction, get Garnett’s ring back, and find a way to pay his bookies all the while dodging debt collectors, dealing with his wife Dinah (the always fabulous Idina Menzel), and keeping his mistress Julia (Julia Fox giving a star is born performance) happy.  Uncut Gems traverses more time and a more complicated story than Good Time but maintains the same anxiety-inducing momentum. There’s not as much of a plot as there is a cyclical series of events, which makes it even more uncomfortable to watch — maybe even frustrating. Like Pattinson, Sandler plays Howard as a man you can almost root for. You admire his sheer will and motivation. But then he always ends up doing something that makes you shake your head. It’s impressive just how much the Safdies are able to make you squirm without making you run out of the theater. The entire movie is a train wreck. Just one you can’t take your eyes off of. That’s a compliment. An apt description could be organized chaos.  As much as it seems like the movie is going off the rails, it’s clear that the Safdies are always in control. The frenetic editing, cosmic score by Daniel Lopatin, and truly remarkable sleazy performance by Sandler are designed to make you feel uneasy — it’s challenging to get through. However, its true brilliance lies in Howard’s characterization. He isn’t a sketch of a person. His actions have consequences. Not just on the events of the film, but the people around them. As much chaotic energy the Safdies often put into their films, they still take care to root it in something real and human. The action aside, that’s what makes Uncut Gems truly unnerving.

"Dec 8, 2019"," Directed by Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie.
Starring Adam Sandler, Julia Fox, Lakeith Stanfield, Kevin Garnett, Idina Menzel, Eric Bogosian, Jonathan Aranbayev, Mike Francesa, Jacob Igielski, Noa Fisher, Paloma Elsesser, Judd Hirsch, Benjy Kleiner, Josh Ostrovsky, Sahar Bibiyan, Lana Levitin, Keith Williams Richards, Pom Klementieff, The Weeknd, Trinidad James, Tilda Swinton, and Natasha Lyonne. A charismatic New York City jeweler always on the lookout for the next big score, makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides, in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win. Lowbrow comedians, basketball players, musicians, radio personalities, impressive debut performances; Josh and Benny Safdie sure do know how to cast a movie with unorthodox yet delicious ingredients. They also know how to direct unforgettable character studies that refuse to let you escape the mind (or in one oddly hypnotic artistic moment, the asshole) of its subject. Part of this is achieved by Uncut Gems‘ traditional score (the pulse-pounding synthetic score from returning Good Time collaborator Daniel Lopatin) that is perfectly blended within what amounts to 2+ hours of nonstop shouting, swearing, fighting, and rowdiness, all of which add to the immersion, that would come across as an overbearing annoying mess in lesser hands. Equally crucial and memorable is the cinematography from the gifted Darius Khondji that oscillates around rooms speedily like a ceiling fan about to snap out of place; this is an adrenaline rush that’s matched by the camera’s movement with a diverse and atmospheric color palette rendering nearly every single frame worthy of pausing and observing. The point is that Uncut Gems is master class filmmaking from every conceivable aspect; if Martin Scorsese was the cinematic revolution of his time, the Safdie Brothers are modern-day insurgents (and not just because both filmmakers seem determined to drop as many F-bombs as humanly possible within 2+ hours). This is as transfixing as filmmaking gets, with the Safdie Brothers never once questioning their own vision, pulling punches, or bringing down the energy a few clicks from more than a minute or two before it’s once again balls-to-the-wall insanity. Maybe that’s grandstanding praise, but it’s justified. Under the direction of anyone else Uncut Gems would be an incomprehensible disaster, but depicting reigning chaos with clarity appears to be just another day at the office for these two. Of all the exciting new voices in cinema today, the Safdies may have emerged as the most exciting, which is made all the more mind-blowing considering this is, excluding documentaries, only their fourth film. The New York locals are once again operating within the all familiar location, this time specifically the Diamond District where Howard Ratner (an explosively wayward Adam Sandler working with material that elevates his childish comedic antics into something repulsive yet weirdly empathetic and somewhat easy to cheer on) runs a high-class jewelry store. It’s the kind of establishment one has to make an appointment to do some shopping, which attracts celebrities (not without assistance from his acquaintance Demany as played by LaKeith Stanfield) including NBA star of the Boston Celtics, Kevin Garnett (playing himself). Simultaneously, Howard has just received a shipment containing a rock with embedded gemstones supposedly worth over $1 million, with his first mistake of many (idiocy tends to be a charm for both the character and actor, with Sandler willing to self-deprecate during amusing bets such as him pleading with his disgruntled wife played by Idina Menzel to look into his eyes for forgiveness and say what she feels) bragging about it to the All-Star athlete currently battling the Philadelphia 76ers in the playoffs. Kevin Garnett becomes just as hypnotized as the audience (there’s a prologue that takes us on a cosmic journey from outside the rock to inside these gemstones, also with dazzling cinematography and an unexpected but poignant conclusion), convinced that it can work as a good luck charm towards his critical game-time performance. Howard temporarily trades the oral for his championship ring, which he then pawns to invest in some risky gambling debts, as if he too believes that this artifact bestows a mystical power. The Safdies drop us right into the world of Howard, quickly showing us his scamming ways that never go according to plan, his adultery with one of his clerks (Julia Fox delivering one of the standout debut performances of the year as a sadsack addicted to Howard the same way he is to gambling), the seemingly never-ending amount of debt he owes (I don’t think there’s a single object Howard sells that is not of his own possession) to debt collectors (they are all menacing somehow adding more urgency to the chaos), and the unpredictable ups and downs that come from such a lifestyle. Adam Sandler is a tornado here, with his dangerous world coming closer to erupting with every boneheaded decision. He’s also narcissistic and cocky, which is hilariously portrayed during some segments with now mainstream rapper (the film takes place in 2012) The Weeknd (also playing himself) flirting with his mistress. Howard firmly believes that his life is going to go up while everyone else wallows in failure. He’s also willing to do anything to achieve that success, proving that he’s not just addicted to gambling but the art of winning itself, which will either validate his spontaneous and thoughtless behavior or wind up as his permanent undoing. Arrogant as he may be, Howard does know sports and with a magical realism framing device of gemstones that might exhibit fortuitous results, anything can happen in Uncut Gems. Basketball does not need to be a preferred sport to watch or even a general interest to get sucked into the various parlays and bets Howard finds himself ignoring his family and on the edge of his seat over. There is a messiness to the first two-thirds of Uncut Gems that gives way to something crystalline yet suffocatingly tense; by a certain point, I just wanted to hold my breath and not exhale until the credits rolled. Again, it’s another grandstanding complement, but a sensation Uncut Gems earns through immaculate buildup. At one point, Jonah Hill was attached to play the role of Howard, and while I have no doubts he would have been a fine choice, once Adam Sandler is seen in this role there’s no separating him from it. In character, he’s more Jewish than he has ever sounded, louder than he ever has been, and more irresponsible than ever. Uncut Gems gift wraps Sandler the performance of his career, and he runs with it just as frenetically as the film itself. There’s a scene where he is in the backseat of a vehicle and excitedly professes he’s going to cum; that will be me if Sandler receives an Oscar nomination. It’s Sandler’s time; go all the fucking way and show the world how you win.",POSITIVE
"Dec 8, 2019"," Indie filmmakers Benny Safdie & Josh Safdie (“Heaven Knows What”/”Good Time”) present arguably their best film yet, an exciting urban crime thriller with loopy characters who would make Damon Runyon come out of his grave to give nicknames to. It’s co-written by the creative brothers of dark humor films and Ronald Bronstein, and impacted with a certain NYC chutzpah that keeps it always hopping with never ending angles, slimy characters and dirty incidents.We follow the screw-up Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) around for a week in 2012. The middle-aged hustler is a charismatic but obnoxious, fast-talking, brash and compulsive gambler, who works as a New York City jeweler located in the Diamond District. He maintains a loveless marriage in New Jersey with his coarse wife Dinah (Idina Menzel). Always looking to bet on a sporting event and knowing how to get around town to avoid bookies he owes big money to, he thrives on his lowlife lifestyle and living in his chaotic setting. He believes he will make a big score when he receives a package from Ethiopia of a gleaming chunk of opal-encrusted rock and sells it to the NBA Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett, a customer in his jewelry shop. Garnett is hypnotized by it and trades it for his championship ring, while Howard arranges to put the opal on the auction block and have Garnett buy it back. Trouble is Howard has big debts with the bookies and to avoid a beating or worse, he pawns Garnett’s ring in a pawnshop and uses the money to make bets that he believes will  square things with all parties.When the stone goes missing, Howard searches for it among various unreliable characters: such as the scary goon debt collector Arno (Eric Bogosian). He also must deal with his unhappy wife wanting to dump him, and his brassy and coarse much younger counter clerk mistress Julia (Julia Fox) whom he pays the rent for her Manhattan apartment and who might have actually fallen in love with him.Sandler gives his best performance to date, and moves up the ladder from playing stupid and klutzy comic characters like in The Waterboy to more interesting and complex characters in this gem.",POSITIVE
"Dec 6, 2019"," Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) owns KMH, a jewelry store in New York City’s diamond district. Howard’s marriage is rocky, partially because of his mistress, KMH’s Julia (Julia Fox), but also because of the danger brought on by his gambling debts. He has a colleague, Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who brings him special clientele like the Boston Celtics’ Kevin Garnett, who becomes unduly attached to the raw black African opal Howard had hoped to make a killing with at an auction of “Uncut Gems.” Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) owns KMH, a jewelry store in New York City’s diamond district.

He has a colleague, Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), who brings him special clientele like the Boston Celtics’ Kevin Garnett, who becomes unduly attached to the raw black African opal Howard had hoped to make a killing with at an auction of “Uncut Gems.” Cowriter (with Ronald Bronstein)/directors Benny & Josh Safdie’s (""Good Time"") high energy NYC based films have been getting more and more assured. Their latest, which has been on their back burner since their first, may be unlike anything you’ve experienced, as if the helicopter sequence in Martin Scorsese’s “Goodfellas” were extended to feature film length. The film is both exhausting and anxiety provoking to watch, a relentless visual and aural assault, but the filmmaking brothers and their star Sandler plunge us into the mind of a hyperactive hustler so effectively, one simply must acknowledge their brilliance even if the experience isn’t exactly enjoyable. Be prepared to strap yourself onto a cinematic rocket. The film begins with a bold motif that has us traveling through the figurative bowels of an African opal mine and the literal bowels of our protagonist. The mined prize, which Howard has valued at $1 million, holds a mystical power for both those who find it and Garnett. The Celtics player clearly views it as some kind of talisman and is annoyed to learn Howard showed it to him with no intention of selling. So in his first of many bad decisions, Howard agrees to let the man take it overnight, securing it with Garnett’s championship ring - which he immediately pawns to pay down a gambling debt and make another, assured his opal will bring Garnett good juju on the court that night. Howard’s got to keep the auction house awaiting his opal at bay, owes his brother-in-law Aron (Eric Bogosian) hundreds of thousands and has two vicious thugs on his tail who show up at his daughter’s school play and lock him into his own car trunk. His wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), has stopped being amused long ago. A trip downtown to a private event headlined by The Weeknd causes a rift with Julia and Howard has such a hell of a time getting that opal back he forgets to buy back that ring. The Safdie brothers have created a narrative Rube Goldberg machine in multiple dimensions, their protagonist keeping so many balls in the air we hold our breath waiting for them to rain down upon him. Cinematographer Darius Khondji’s darting camera keeps us on edge, at one point literally as Howard keeps his gambit going by leaning out an upper floor window to pass cash to Julia in another room as he’s being cornered. Daniel Lopatin’s score is nerve shredding, high in the mix during the film’s opening scenes, adding to the general unease. Yet through all this we cannot help but root for Howard, Sandler’s performance such a high wire balance of charisma and crazy we see the good guy spinning within his own adrenaline addiction. His fast talking, constant movement toward the ultimate win may have blurred his priorities, but as with most Sandler characters, his good heart shines through. Support ranges from professional actors like Judd Hirsch to newcomers like Garnett and other non actors, all meshing together realistically within the world the Safdies have created. Keep an eye on Julia Fox, who makes a strong impression here as Howard’s lovable lovely, tested for her loyalty and in the end, the only one to have his back.",POSITIVE
"Dec 6, 2019"," Uncut Gems begins far from Adam Sandler. In Ethiopia, an injured miner’s carried by a group of his fellow workers. We glimpse the miner’s nauseating leg break, though seeing it draws little sympathy from the mine’s non-native foremen, further infuriating the already collecting group of laborers, looking ready to riot. A fracas breaks out—chaos begets more chaos, as is the Safdie brothers’ way—while two workers slip away to head deep into the mine and chip out their own discovery. They seem to know where to find it: a huge gem, which they hold up for the audience. Cinematographer Darius Khondji’s camera moves closer to the gem to inspect, to create a tactile connection with the rock maybe, only to move in so close we plunge beneath its surface—caves within caves—and emerge, amidst a cosmos of particles, from Adam Sandler’s butthole. We’ve always known Sandler’s had it in him; this may be exactly what we had in mind. It’s 2012, the Celtics are in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and we meet Howard Ratner (Sandler) mid-colonoscopy. He’ll spend the majority of Uncut Gems waiting for the procedure’s findings, but any worries about what the doctor may find up his ass is quickly subsumed by the clusterfuck of Howard’s quotidian. The proprietor of an exclusive shop in New York’s diamond district, Howard does well for himself and his family, though he can’t help but gamble compulsively, owing his brother-in-law Aron (Eric Bogosian, malevolently slimy) a substantial amount. Still, Howard has other risks to balance—his payroll’s comprised of Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), a finder of both clients and product, and Julia (Julia Fox, an unexpected beacon amidst the storm in her first feature role), a clerk with whom Howard’s carrying on an affair, “keeping” her comfortable in his New York apartment. Except his wife’s (Idina Menzel, pristinely jaded) obviously sick of his shit, and meanwhile he’s got a special delivery coming from Africa: a black opal, the stone we got to know intimately in the film’s first scene, which Howard estimates is worth millions. Then Demany happens to bring Kevin Garnett (as himself, keyed so completely into the Safdie brothers’ tone) into the shop on the same day the opal arrives, inspiring a once-in-a-lifetime bet for Howard—the kind that’ll square him with Aron and then some—as well as a host of new crap to get straight. It’s all undoubtedly stressful—really relentlessly, achingly stressful—but the Safdies, on their sixth film, seem to thrive in anxiety, capturing the inertia of Howard’s life, and of the innumerable lives colliding with his, in all of its full-bodied beauty. Visceral to the hilt, the sensation of watching Uncut Gems betrays how gracefully it operates in so many contradictory directions. It’s a granular take on a few days with a small but deeply rooted New York Jewish community, but also a tale of one man’s bid for greatness amongst the incomprehensible vastness of the universe. It features a diamond-encrusted Furby, but also The Weeknd plays himself in a scene that confirms he’s everything we hoped he wasn’t. Does he know he comes off as someone whose songs are sadly true? Does he care? Howard is a bad man, but does that matter when he can wrangle some sort of mystical order from the entropy that is modern life and use it to his advantage? When Kevin Garnett first gets his hands on the black opal, the lives that brought both him and the gem to that moment, that place, flash before his eyes. He tells Howard, confesses almost, that he needs the opal, that he feels bound to it, bound through his past, and his ancestors’ pasts. Howard, too, has a pretty good idea where that opal came from, what kind of ethical morass was traversed to bring it to him, but in light of Garnett’s weird lust, Howard decides to make a radical bet and carry on as if the story of that opal, all the lives it’s claimed and all the pain it represents, isn’t bound up in him, like factory farm meat in his colon. Forever.  As in Punch Drunk Love—alluded to by a bright blue suit Howard wears on an especially promising morning—here Adam Sandler is a calm center to the ceaseless churn of reality around him, but still buzzing with constant, dreadful energy just beneath that equally constant smile. Sandler seems to get the bleak hilarity of Howard, how the man weaponizes despair even though he fundamentally believes the fates are on his side. Maybe every character Adam Sandler plays does the same. Just before a game, Howard reveals to Garnett his grand plan for a big payday, explaining that Garnett gets it, right? That guys like them are keyed into something greater, working on a higher wavelength than most—that this is how they win. He may be onto something, or he may be pulling everything out of his ass—regardless, Howard gets the news from his doctor that his colon’s clear. And if you remember the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals, Garnett came out of Game 7 triumphant. Sandler’s eyes twinkle with adrenaline. He isn’t funny, but absolutely everything he does is worthy of laughter. It can get overwhelming. His performance is a gift. In the Safdies’ previous film, Good Time, we’re never sure of Connie’s (Robert Pattinson) fate beyond that of his brother’s (Benny Safdie). In its final scene, we’re given some reprieve from the melee of Connie’s past couple hours by getting a chance to see how his brother will fare from then on, how he may finally get a chance to find some stability, some sense of care, in an otherwise broken system. In Uncut Gems, that reprieve comes with less comfort: Chances are, all of this didn’t matter. Maybe nothing matters. And yet, Uncut Gems still feels so vital. A marvel of so many confounding, disparate elements that somehow conspire to bring us from one side of the earth to the other. One would think the Safdies got lucky were we not wiser to their talent.",POSITIVE
"Dec 5, 2019"," The Safdie brothers continue their winning streak of making harshly real films about everyday New Yorkers with fatal flaws. But this time, they’ve also given Adam Sandler a platform to show just how good he is with the right collaborators. The results are as stylish as they are affecting.",POSITIVE
"Dec 5, 2019"," There’s a reason that, at his best, Adam Sandler can be an incredibly compelling on-screen presence. He knows how to play pathetic, and still have you root for him. Whatever minor evolution there is for his more notable characters, whether in the “Happy Madison” comedies or his more serious efforts, the audience wants this schmuck to succeed. Uncut Gems plays hard into the desperation Sandler can bring to a role, with directors Josh and Benny Safdie crafting a story dedicated to pushing their lead character into a high-wire balancing act designed to destroy your senses raise stress levels. Rarely have I been further on the edge of my seat watching a film like this unfold, and at the center is the Sandman, dominating the film with plenty of help around him. Sandler stars as Howard Ratner, a New York jewelry store owner and compulsive gambler. He owes people all over town, including the dangerous ones at the end of their rope. Howard is quite the schemer. He’s spending Passover weekend (side note: this is now the best Passover movie) getting a colorful and rare Ethiopian gem ready for a massive sale while rubbing elbows with potential high-class buyers such as NBA star Kevin Garnett and The Weekend. At the same time, he’s balancing his home life, which includes a soon-to-be ex-wife (Idina Menzel), his kids, and his employee/mistress (Julia Fox). To say the time spent with Howard is tumultuous would be an understatement. Co-writer Ronald Bronstein has been with the Safdie’s since their underground beginnings and has served as co-editor on each of their films as well. It’s worth noting, as this is a 134-minute feature that has to be digestible for an audience, while never letting up on the pressure. There is a constant tension based on Howard’s actions, which can be a tricky line to walk as far as sticking with this guy, as well as being thrilled for the times when something comes through for him, only to have it taken away for various reasons in the very next scene. As mentioned, Sandler knows how to play pitiful figures, and what a role this is. It’s not just that Howard is down on his luck, he’s a self-destructive maniac with the most high-strung New York attitude you could ask for. The guy is irritating to just about everyone in his life and never knows when to shut up. And yet, you need him to win. Uncut Gems knows how to put success on display. We see the ecstasy on Howard’s face when he’s at his happiest; winning. Daniel Lopatin’s electronic and synth-infused score does all it can to find the majesty of what good potential there is for Howard, even when things are seen at their grimiest. There’s also the plethora of people Howard must continuously contend with. The women in his life show the reasons they can see something of a fondness for Howard, we just happen to be seeing them at different stages. While Menzel’s character is far past tolerating him, Fox can’t help but see a funny guy who likes to connect with people. Lakeith Stanfield shines once again as Demany, a hustler with connections in high places. He’s also up for accepting Howard as he is but knows how to put him in his place. Garnett is impressively good as one of the sources fueling the darkly comedic edge coursing through this film. He finds himself obsessed with the gem in Howard’s possession, which becomes a significant factor in both of their lives. Family does matter as well. In addition to his wife and kids, Howard gets to deal with Eric Bogosian and Judd Hirsch as relatives joining him for Passover seder dinner, as well as factoring into his life as a foolish gambler on opposite ends of the spectrum. They, too, add to the humor as well as the menace presented in a film functioning as a punishing odyssey. Moreover, the effort and experience they bring to their roles only spurs on Sandler to continue delivering as well as he does. Playing into being someone as exhausting and exasperating as he is magnetic, means having a production that knows how to move with it all. Yves Belanger’s cinematography pulls this off, showing the walls subtly closing around Howard. We watch him try to talk and move his way out of confined spaces, whether it’s in his security-assisted jewelry shop, the closet of an apartment, or the trunk of his car. Seeing various cuts to new locations, with the occasional break in the form of focusing on the colors of that precious gem, we are constantly treated to the visually wondrous look of a city Howard dares to destroy him. I was caught off-guard by the Safdie Brother’s Good Time back in 2017. The exciting, live-wire work from Robert Pattinson was a real jolt. Apparently, I still wasn’t prepared for Uncut Gems. The work from all involved led to an exhilarating film that had me wanting to reach into the screen and shake Sandler away from all his bad decisions. At the same time, covering my eyes, while still peeking through my fingers would have been the best method to see so many insane scenarios play out in an intensely paced package that’s as much a rollercoaster ride as it is exceptional cinema. Given how Martin Scorsese serves as an executive producer, that only makes it all the more fitting. Whatever the case, being pathetic has never been this captivating.",POSITIVE
"Dec 4, 2019"," Uncut Gems es un thriller emocionalmente cargado que no se ve con mucha frecuencia hoy en día. Conocemos a Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), un joyero carismático y apostador de la ciudad de Nueva York que, después de diecisiete meses de espera, obtiene una piedra especial de Etiopía que vale cientos de miles de dólares. Si bien su valor puede ser más alto de lo previsto, el hombre establece una fecha de subasta con la esperanza de obtener la mayor cantidad de dinero posible. Sin embargo, su interminable endeudamiento y su capacidad para atraer problemas no tienen fin hasta el momento en que comienza un juego peligroso que puede poner en riesgo todo por lo que ha trabajado duro, incluida su vida. Uncut Gems comparte con su predecesora Good Times (2017) la urgencia, la fascinación por el estrés, por el momento acusado de nerviosismo por una cadena de malas decisiones. Con la diferencia de que los hermanos Safdie abren un panorama más amplio, especialmente a los personajes y la vida, enfocándose en Adam Sandler como padre judío, comerciante de joyas y fanático del baloncesto. Es un viaje salvaje por un corto tiempo de su vida. Todo debe salir mal para mantener el ritmo, tropezar de una idea a la siguiente, y mantenernos muy cerca de la acción, pero nada de esto ocurre gratuitamente.  Las apuestas es otra forma severa de adicción en la que una persona invierte no solo su tiempo, sino su dinero, alma e incluso su vida, esta última en el peor de los casos. Y cuando desaparece la autoconciencia del hecho y esta es reemplazada por la adrenalina de lo apostado, cosas malas sucederán más rápido que un abrir y cerrar de ojos. Dirigida por Benny y Josh Safdie, Uncut Gems es un filme que literalmente no te permitirá levantarte de tu asiento hasta su crédito final. De principio a fin, la película logra hipnotizar al espectador a través del mundo realista de las apuestas, las aventuras, las peleas, los miembros de pandillas e incluso el baloncesto. Toda la película es como una montaña rusa de emociones en la que, los espectadores sensibles pueden sentir palpitaciones debido a que nos hacemos cómplices de las decisiones de nuestro protagonista. Uncut Gems es estresante y, a su manera, también es una joya del mundo cinematográfico. Josh y Benny Safdie construyen toda la película a partir de detalles pequeños. Estos son el núcleo emocional de la narración y es a través de estos es que conectamos con los personajes. Sin dudas, el hilo conductor por excelencia es Adam Sandler, cada escena en la que se encuentra no apartamos nuestra mirada de él, sus gestos, su voz, su mirada y sus decisiones están creadas milimétricamente para nuestra apreciación. Sus expresiones faciales, ya sea hablando, caminando, o incluso viendo televisión, es como pintar un personaje en la pared que no se puede quitar.  Daniel Lopatin, también conocido como Oneohtrix Point Never, es desde el primer momento notablemente la desconocida estrella detrás de Uncut Gems , al mismo nivel que Adam Sandler y los hermanos Safdie. No es raro que la banda sonora de una película sea tan importante para  experiencia cinematográfica, aquí es imprescindible. Esta impresión, que fue similar en la última película de los dos directores, tiene algo que ver con la excentricidad, la música crea momentos, hace montajes, crea las imágenes, hace el ritmo narrativo. A menudo, la música tiene un efecto de contrapunto, un sonido de jazz se arrastra a la composición electro, la música se detiene, donde nada parece ocurrir y es allí donde mejor funciona. Pero tan pronto volvemos a la acción, la música, y los diferentes medios vuelven a encontrar un ritmo común. Las partituras hacen gran parte del trabajo aquí a su vez e independientemente, es un enfoque que habla por la ambición artística de los hermanos Safdie. Los Safdie no cambian los registros, no cambian de velocidad, sino que fusionan ambos espectros. Raramente hay un momento de alivio a través del humor, pero su personaje que está lleno de decisiones absurdas, momentos que refuerza la tensión, nos hace lanzar una carcajada nerviosa. Al igual que la musicalización hiperbólica, el movimiento constante de la cámara y un suave montaje suave pero rápido ayudan a mantener la presión alta, todo esto les asegura que cada secuencia sea siempre una experiencia nueva, incluyendo este impactante final.

"Dec 4, 2019"," The Safdie brothers have served up an ear blasting, soul piercing, and pretty damn thrilling take on how the American Dream can go very, very wrong. In his best performance yet, Adam Sandler (yes, Adam Sandler) stars as a modern day jeweler with an office tucked away in New York’s Diamond District. Howard Ratner is in trouble. Up to his eyeballs in debt, Howard knows he’s this close to making that big score. He’ll be fine. His family will be fine. His girlfriend will be fine. All he’s gotta do is get Kevin Garnett to buy the chunk of gems just in from Africa. Or score huge at an auction. Or have his numbers come in on the game. Any game. Howard is cocaine personified. Constantly moving, shaking things up. He vibrates his way across 47th Street to the pawnbroker. He prowls around his suburban home, flicks through his glitzy pied-a-terre, constantly texting, checking the scores. But Howard’s no shirker. He really does plan on paying everybody back, on doing at least some good for the wife and kids. He shows up for school plays and Passover. He does believe. And, thanks to Sandler’s beautifully calibrated performance, so do we. Or at least so do we want to. The Safdie style may not be for everyone, especially if they are looking for an easily digestible, feel good entertainment. But, oh, what a treat those people are missing. Yes, this is a noisy, almost relentless movie. It should be. It’s about high livers in New York. But there are quieter moments, scenes that nail a certain type of American Jewish life, which are presented with the same “here you go” as is Sandler’s Hanukah Song. It is, as one of the year’s other best films tells us, what it is. And I loved it.",POSITIVE

"Nov 27, 2019","  Much like their last film, 2017's Good Time, the Safdie Brothers' Uncut Gems is a grimy '70s-style Scorsesean character piece that cranks its settings up to eleven, in an effort to send your anxiety levels spiking. Love 'em or hate 'em, the pair have a uniquely frantic storytelling voice befitting of their movies and the way they explore addiction in all the many forms it can take, but especially addiction to the idea of a big score that will finally give you the life you always wanted. The Safdies only continue to hone their style here, even as their film tests (and shatters) the limits of just how compelling an unlikeable protagonist can actually be. Powered by Adam Sandler's note-perfect turn, Uncut Gems is a stylishly scuzzy work that's as propulsive as it is maddening and exhausting.   Sandler stars in Uncut Gems as Howard Ratner, an NYC jewelry store owner whose life is a chaotic mess; he's in debt to almost everyone he knows, he's on the verge of leaving his wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) for his young employee Julia (Julia Fox), and the second he has any extra money, he gambles it away betting on professional basketball games. However, when he gets his hands on a precious Ethiopian black opal and finds a buyer in NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (as himself, circa 2012), Howard believes he's finally struck gold. Of course, that's assuming he can pull his scheme off before someone he owes cash to decides to take him out for good.   Uncut Gems is, above all else, an extremely loud and jittery film. Characters are constantly talking (nay, yelling) over one another, and it's a testament to the movie's sound design that you can clearly make out everything that's being shouted at once (assuming it doesn't simply overwhelm you). This is the world Howard lives in and as off-putting as one may find it to be, the Safdies do an impressive job of bringing it to cinematic life. The pair are further aided and abetted by Darius Khondji's beautifully unvarnished cinematography, which juxtaposes its disreputable portrait of NYC and its residents with shots of the interiors of the black opal and the cosmic splendor it contains within. And much like he did with Good Time, Daniel Lopatin aka. Oneohtrix Point Never composes a lively electronica score that keeps Uncut Gems feeling unsettling, even in its rare quieter moments.   This brings us to the movie's biggest problem: Howard. A film doesn't need to have a likable lead to be successful, but it's hard to find Howard interesting as a protagonist when he's so unabashedly slimy, self-serving, and foolhardy all at once. Uncut Gems doesn't ask viewers to empathize with him so much as pity him, but even that's difficult because, as far as antiheroes go, Howard isn't really so much a charming sleaze-ball as he is, well, merely a sleaze-ball. And while the movie certainly doesn't glorify him, its plot starts to become repetitive as Howard screws up again and again in increasingly foreseeable ways. Good Times' Connie Nikas was also sleazy and privileged, but his decent intentions made him tragic; Uncut Gems portrays Howard as being more tragicomical, but the dark humor of his story comes through much stronger than the tragedy.   Sandler's performance, however, is another matter. The role of Howard is, in many ways, tailor-made for the actor; he's like a more realistic version of the rich goofball dads Sandler has played in his comedies over the last decade, similar to how Punch-Drunk Love's Barry Egan resembled a more grounded version of the man-children Sandler played earlier on in his career. Sandler makes the character more engaging in spite of his repugnant nature, and it's easy to believe he would irritate the people around him (including, Lakeith Stanfield in a characteristically good turn as Howard's partner, Demany) as readily as he does. Fox is also fascinating as ""Jules"", a survivalist who knows how to navigate the seedy world of wealthy older men preying on young women, yet allows herself to be truly vulnerable with Howard, and vice versa. The rest of the Uncut Gemscast feel a bit wasted, though, as they pop up for a scene or two to rant at Howard for being awful (which, to be fair, is fun), then go about their merry way.   Half a dozen feature films into their career, it's reasonable to call the Safdies polarizing storytellers at this point. Their neo-noir dramas and crime-thrillers about characters driven to self-destruction by their addictive behavior (whether they crave a literal drug or figurative one) have a distinct style that, depending on who you ask, is either electrifyingly intense, obnoxiously frenzied, or a bit of both at the same time. In the case of Uncut Gems, it's a movie that takes you on a proper roller coaster ride, but one where the turns become easier to spot as time goes on, and leaves you feeling too wiped out to invest emotionally in its shady lead. Those who adored the Safdies' previous work will probably dig this one too; everyone else might be better off looking for their next big score elsewhere.   Uncut Gems is now playing in U.S. theaters nationwide. It is 135 minutes long and is rated R for pervasive strong language, violence, some sexual content and brief drug use.  The sequel to the 1986 classic Labyrinth is facing some major challenges, but it's already guaranteed to beat the original movie in a big way. Dune 2's ending delivers an epic conclusion to this chapter of Paul Atreides' story, as the sequel also teases what is next for the sci-fi franchise. The fates of several characters from The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes are unknown, but one line from Catching Fire offers a hint about one.",NEUTRAL
"Nov 27, 2019"," The unique genius of the Safdie Bros is that they can put Adam Sandler in one of his best dramatic roles to date and still start the movie with a classic Sandman butthole joke. In Uncut Gems, Sandler plays skeezy jeweler Howard, a Jewish Big Apple resident and compulsive gambler in Manhattan’s Diamond District. We meet Howard via his insides, in the midst of a colonoscopy, and things just get more shit for him from there. Howard owes just about everyone in the city, running up spendy vigs with the local pawn shops, wheeling and dealing with low-rent loansharks, and making sketchy deals with his more mobbed-up acquaintances. Exactly the kind of people you don’t want to owe a penny to. Partnering with Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), a Rolex-fence and “customer relations” aid, Howard spends every waking moment of his day trying to hit the jackpot. Be that by a huge sale, a big-time gambling hit, or by dodging the various collectors coming after him for money or products owed. He lives for the action, a fact that makes every second of Uncut Gems laced with anxiety, every interaction primed to go in the very worst direction possible.  A neurotic and compulsive gambler, Howard may have hit the score of his life when he invests in a raw black opal smuggled out of Africa, which immediately catches the eye of Boston Celtics player Kevin Garnet (played by the now-retired athlete himself). Garnet sees the jewel as a magic rock of sorts and just has to have it. Between this and Parasite, it seems 2019 is the year of the magic movie rock, and you can prepare for Uncut Gems to head to similarly unpleasant places, either in spite of said magic rock or because of it. Before Howard can collect on his big score, he needs to settle his myriad debts, particularly to distant family member Arno (Eric Bogosian) and his legion of goons.  Writer and director combo Benny and Josh Safdie harness an extremely unnerving tone reminiscent of their last film, Good Time, ratcheting up the tension and refusing to relieve it once throughout. The experience is stress-inducing and haunting, the final moments of the film, in particular, threatening to linger with audiences for days to come. Akin to railing a line of ADHD medication, Uncut Gems left me high strung, my brain burning with a cinematic hangover, and that’s precisely the point. Part of this is the Safdie Bros and writing partner Ronald Bronstein’s frenetic script, which is a word salad of characters yelling over each other, the cadence of the language aggressive and unceasing. The directors allow the dialogue to take on an abrasive musical quality, with overbearing beats competing for attention. I was left scrambling to figure out who to pay attention to and when but that is all part of the high-wire stress that the Safdies have tried to create here, verbalizing the constantly spinning inner wheels of Howard’s relentless plots. Sandler is perfectly cast as Howard, capturing the character’s glazed-over, thousand-yard-stare highs and the motormouthed bullshit artist con game that Howie is nearly always spitting. The performance borders on annoying, like a persistent mosquito that you just can’t seem to swat away, but that’s the lifeblood of this character. He’s quite awful. In a knowing reversal of the film’s title, Howard is the opposite of a diamond in the rough. He’s no uncut gem. He’s a dirtbag with few redeeming qualities. His wife despises him. His girlfriend, he treats like garbage. His kids endure him at best. He might be unpolished but no matter how many times you shine him up and give him another chance, Howard will still be an obnoxious piece of trash doomed to make the wrong decision over and over again until it ruins the lives of all those around him.  This sense of human poisonousness seems to fascinate the Safdies, who just recently drew up Robert Pattinson’s Connie Nikas, a typhoon of a character who ruined just about everything he touched. While he’s no bank robber, Howard’s incessant chasing of gambling highs makes him equally a destructive force, both to himself and those closest to him. As the movie speeds to an inevitable conclusion, viewers watch a painstaking portrait of a man helpless to his worst instincts. I cannot speak to their utter fascination with self-destruction but few filmmakers translate these kinds of characters better than the Safdies.  With a supporting cast that includes Idina Menzel in one of her few live-action movie roles, b-ball boy Garnett, former-Playboy model and breakout Julia Fox, and pop-singer The Weeknd, one has to admire the many seemingly bizarre casting decisions of Uncut Gems. From casting Sandler as the film’s hard-to-like protagonist to throwing a bunch of otherwise famous people to support him, the Safdies are comfortable taking risks and it really works out here, giving the film a kind of sadistic realism that informs the sense of danger and despair. That danger and despair casts a long shadow over Uncut Gems and its sad stable of characters, contributing to a difficult feature that only A24 could (and would) deliver. Destined not to be everyone’s cup of tea, those wanting to induce an in-theater panic attack need look no further than the Safdies’ latest creation. CONCLUSION: Adam Sandler puts on his serious shoes as a neurotic compulsive gambler in the Safdie Brother’s high-stress drama ‘Uncut Gems’. A challenging picture sure to leave you scrambled, the film is another off-the-beaten-path venture for the Safdies who continue their streak of nerving-wracking and esoteric adult cinema.

"Nov 21, 2019"," The 57th New York Film Festival came to a close this past weekend, following nearly three weeks of premieres, Q&As, and specialty screenings that collectively showcased some of the year’s best and most anticipated titles. Imposing any overarching theme across a spread of titles as varied and vividly specific as this year’s would be a fool’s errand (or perhaps a Joker‘s), destined to reduce and ill-serve each.  There were vicious social satires, monumental mob epics, breakneck thrillers, and glimmering memory pieces, all with something poignant and thoughtful to say about the ways in which deciding who we are can grow much more complicated and fraught when we exist within systems designed to mold us into certain shapes. Emblematic of how love can free you even if it’s the kind sure to leave you devastated, Portrait of a Lady on Fire was the best movie I saw at the New York Film Festival. A truly perfect film that’s so exquisitely shot as to somehow equal its story, it’s one of the most indelible visions of romantic passion I’ve ever seen in a theater.  Set along the windswept shores of 18th century Brittany, Portrait follows the elegant Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), who’s engaged by her mother to be married. Protesting the arrangement, she refuses to sit for a portrait, to be sent to the future husband. There’s fire in her veins, undoubtedly, but also a deeper despair haunting her at the edges. Marianne (Noémie Merlant), a young painter hired in secret to paint Héloïse, is just the new arrival to occupy her restless mind, even if their relationship is forged under false pretenses. Posing as a walking companion who’s hired so that Héloïse can safely traverse the jagged cliffs of the French coast, Marianne’s meant to study Héloïse in long, clandestine looks that deepen with meaning when, one day, Héloïse returns them in kind.  In the hands of writer-director Céline Sciamma (Girlhood), Portrait is a treillage of such glances, elegantly framing these two as they circle one another, consumed by their shared fascination and quietly ecstatic as it spills into something more than that. The way Sciamma shoots them, vivid as Fauvist paintings against the coastal vistas, must be seen for what it truly is: a radical act of love. Its politics of desire and visibility are breathtaking to behold and cerebral to consider, especially framed as they are from a feminist, queer perspective. Through that female gaze, Portrait’s expressions of what art can signify, how much a look can carry, what power is contained in the making of an image (and who gets to make it) don’t just resonate. They’re revolutionary. For a time, this life feels survivable, if bitter. But then, while playing with Pashka, Iya freezes on top of the boy, and something unspeakably terrible befalls both of them. (The director, an incendiary 27-year-old talent named Kantemir Balagov, lets this scene play out with soul-annihilating clarity.) Pashka’s real mother is Masha (Vasilisa Perelygina), who sent the boy to live with Iya when she was invalided out of the war. The emotional wildfire to Iya’s permafrost, she returns home full of sublimated rage and need. Beanpole is a tragedy of almost surreal magnitude for Iya and Masha, who feel the blue in their fingers whenever holding each another close. They are two dead trees in this scorched landscape, of little comfort to one another, barely known to themselves. But if Balagov’s narrative offers them little respite from the bone-deep horrors of their broken world, his formally elegant direction—flushed with color and winter light—suggests a stifled beauty still lying dormant somewhere. And as Iya and Masha gradually regain control over their own lives, sifting through the rubble, Beanpole flickers with barely believed hope. It may be a lie—these women certainly tell plenty, to themselves as much as anyone listening—but there’s nothing false about how these two will their way through their impossible winter with only a dream of spring to sustain them.  Another kind of love—the quiet campfire glow of a friendship that nourishes—emanates off the screen in Kelly Reichardt’s frontier tale First Cow. The filmmaker’s known for her rugged, pastoral depictions of human connection in the natural world, and this quietly graceful yarn might surpass her past films by virtue of locating a rich vein of humor beneath the great frontier that her previous works left largely untapped.  Like most of her films, First Cow combines Reichardt’s favored ingredients—animal symbolism, ambiguous endings, and unexpected encounters with friendly strangers—into something humane and deceptively insightful. The film focuses on a soft-hearted American cook (John Magaro) who strikes up a friendship with a Chinese sailor (Orion Lee) after saving him from irate pursuers. At an Oregon Territory trading post, the two go into business together once they realize the cook’s “oily cakes” could become the area’s most in-demand provision. There’s only one problem: making the cakes requires the pair to secretly milk a cow belonging to the local land baron (Toby Jones), who’d be none-too-happy to learn he’d been stolen from.  You can surely tell where this is all going, but the story moves forward in such an easy, fluid motion that it scarcely matters. Reichardt’s a master at this kind of naturalistic, open-hearted storytelling, and her latest is quietly generous and lyrical, adding metaphorical dimensions as it peers deeper into questions of just what it means to exist at a fixed point in time, into a world will linger for long after you lie down for good. Love is also etched across every frame of Pain and Glory, Pedro Almodóvar’s rich and gentle memory piece. It’s as autobiographical a film as the director has made, yet far too playful and self-effacing to be reduced to mere hagiography. At its center, Antonio Banderas plays Salvador Mallo, a Spanish director in his twilight years, a reformed enfant terrible with Almodóvar’s own spiky gray hair who’s plagued by chronic pain and memories of a time when his mind felt more agile.  The similarities to Almodóvar don’t end there. Pain and Glory jumps between Salvador’s Catholic upbringing in a Spanish village and his current creative crisis, as he battles problems with his own declining health and escalating drug addiction. It’s the role of Banderas’s career, and the actor delivers a performance that is by turns theatrical and finely measured but unfailingly authentic. Read our previous review of the film here. Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman is another movie about all the little moments that can make a life—and, in the case of its morally bankrupt characters, ruin a soul. A poetic, portentous return to the gangster genre for Scorsese after Goodfellas and Mean Streets, the film runs three-and-a-half-hours and spans decades in the life of mob hitman Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro).  The Irishman is a manifestly sprawling tapestry of a film, a portrait of mob life that doubles as a near-complete history of American organized crime and corruption in the 20th century. But that makes Scorsese’s intimate focus on character all the more riveting and special.  A true lion in winter, the director here dispenses with the brio of his earlier gangster pictures, instead mulling the existential consequences of such bloody work, in a vein more similar to Silence. Like in that religious epic, there’s a stillness to The Irishman that creeps up on you, a haunting weight that De Niro carries in his sunken eyes and stooped shoulders. All the made men here are working in a register more muted and melancholic than you might expect, including a sublime Al Pacino as the self-interested local politico Jimmy Hoffa, one of Frank’s close confidants, and Joe Pesci as Russell Buffalino, the quietly terrifying older mob member who opens Frank with open arms.  But as Scorsese expertly charts the years of their lives, his wider aim makes all the more sense. The Irishman is the systematic dismantling of the mob myth Scorsese and his collaborators helped to popularize all those years ago, an incisive meditation on the ways in which bad men justify their actions, and a reminder that time always tells the truth about them in the end. It is a significant, late-stage accomplishment for both its director and the genre he pioneered. It’s amusing to see The Irishman, this towering work of artistic reappraisal, play in the same festival as two movies heavily indebted to Scorsese and concerned chiefly with recapturing the lightning-in-a-bottle ferocity of his earlier work. The first, Joker (more on that here), is a skin-deep impersonation of two Scorsese films, Taxi Driver and The King of Comedy, that impressively replicates their aesthetics and sense of psychological deterioration without any appreciation for the mordant humor veined beneath each.  But Uncut Gems, the new film from Good Time filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie, recalls Mean Streets for more reasons than just its remarkably scuzzy, nerve-shredding sense of propulsion. It’s worth noting here that Scorsese, and Irishman producer Emma Tillinger-Koskoff, both executive-produced Uncut Gems. You understand what they saw in it.  The inverse of the teeming, electric New York in Uncut Gems must be the serene artists’ docile that occupies one half of the emotional landscape in Marriage Story, possibly the best American movie of the year. Noah Baumbach, writer-director of The Squid and the Whale (which explored his parents’ divorce in gently moving detail), brings to this gorgeous and devastating film the full, complicated measure of his own experiences, following the end of a long-term relationship with actress Jennifer Jason Leigh.  Adam Driver is Charlie. Scarlett Johansson is Nicole. These two once shared a great love, but they have decided to separate. He’s a stage director in New York City. She’s an actress, once his muse, who’s enthralled by “the space” of Los Angeles, but really by the prospect of making a decision for herself. At first, the divorce between them is less than devastating; they want to be friends and work out a version of their lives that, though different, will make things easier on their kid. But the best-laid intentions can’t always close the emotional and monetary fissures that erupt throughout divorce. Nicole wants to move to L.A. and, when Charlie follows her, he learns that she’s hired a divorce lawyer named Nora (Laura Dern) who’s famous for driving hard bargains. A little stunned, he hires a kindly family lawyer (Alan Alda), and then, when that’s not sufficient, a bulldog (Ray Liotta).  Marriage Story is about the brutal bloodsport of divorce as it exists in the American legal system as much as it is the more nuanced and emotionally uneven aspects of of these lovers’ lives. And it has something to say about the incredible mess of feeling caught up in this separation, which harbors a patently amusing N.Y.-vs-L.A. dichotomy that’s true to Baumbach but also poetic in tracing the larger ways we live with someone to such a point of familiarity we begin to lose sight of them.  Parasite, more savagely and complexly, is a puncturing of the upstairs/downstairs caste metaphor that’s long-serviced class critique in both South Korean and American cinema. Kim Ki-young’s 1960 film The Housemaid was one major touchstone for Bong, and there’s an argument his film conceptually honors Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho better than Gus Van Sant’s fussy remake, but Parasite is most of all its own thing, a gloriously genre-averse work that spikes its wrathful social commentary with bitter, pitch-black laughs and stomach-twisting tension.  That Parasite bears remarkable similarities to last year’s Shoplifters (to which it serves as a dark-mirror twin) and this year’s Us (over which it’s a narratively tighter, more aesthetically unnerving improvement) says something worth heeding about how we’re increasingly grasping, with terrible lucidity, the moral rot that underlays our social hierarchies. Parasite explores some harsh truths about late-stage capitalism, what it does indirectly to our psyches as well as directly to our self-worth, how it’s metastasized into this monstrously unfeeling engine that exists only to propel itself forward, fueled by the flesh and blood of our most vulnerable.

"Nov 19, 2019","  Every once in a blue moon, a familiar star gets a role that changes the way you think of them. They inhabit the part not like a shapeless blanket but as a form fitting suit tailored to their strengths. In the right circumstances, it can reveal striking new dimensions; in rarer instances, it can be weaponized by the canniest of filmmakers. Benny and Josh Safdie, a writing-directing pair of brothers, are two such filmmakers, and the role of Howard Ratner that they gift to Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems is just such a weapon. As shiny as one of the film’s titular stones, there is a cutting edge to Sandler’s depiction of Howie, a New York jewel dealer, gambler, and family man who lives his life with one hand always hovering just above the self-destruct button. It’s electric to watch, but it’s more satisfying still that the Safdies utilize it as just the centerpiece in their showroom: a brilliant distraction that will draw audiences in while the film crafted around it is more intricate than it appears. Indeed, I can safely say that while Uncut Gems is an exercise in seedy pressure cooker storytelling, I have never seen a movie quite like this rascally, weird, and ultimately addictive hybrid. Set during a week in the life of its protagonist, Uncut Gems throws viewers into the deep end with Howie’s buzzy reputation in Manhattan’s Diamond District and the problems that come with it—all of which he’s to blame for. Chief among them is his new prize from Ethiopia, a massive unshaped rock of opal that offers spectacular light shows within its veneer. It took him months to acquire this stone from “Black Jews,” a distinction he throws around a little too happily, but he’s now about to auction it for $1 million. That is until he shows it off to the newest celebrity in his shop, the Celtics’ Kevin Garnett (who plays himself to perfection). Garnett is in Howie’s store because of a deal he has with Demany (LaKeith Stanfield), a middle man who brings celebrities to the location for a cut of whatever they buy. Demany is also the guy who convinces Howie he should let “KG” take the opal he fell in love with home… as good luck before a playoff game. Since Howie has a gambling debt of about $100,000, it seems like a good idea at the time. However, to make a bet on KG and the stone’s mythic powers, he has to get around old pal Arno (Eric Bogosian), who he owes those six figures to, and who has hired two muscled thugs to collect. Those goons are right there every step of the way with Howie as he balances his other fraying business associations, nights at the club, and the time he divides between Long Island and Manhattan—between his estranged wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and their kids, and his new girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox). Then KG takes the opal with him to Philly three days before the auction. Uncut Gems exists in the whiplash induced by jumping between tonal and thematic extremes. It is often uproariously funny but also almost tragic in its ability to instill anxiety for a relentless 135 minutes—all but encouraging you to watch scenes between your fingers, even if most of the runtime is hustlers gabbing between smiles in the back of restaurant kitchens or in the lobby of tony 6th avenue offices. This thrilling disorientation is even accounted for in its blend of reality and fiction, with Sandler hidden behind bedazzled earrings and tinted sunglasses as he tries to seduce real-life basketball star Garnett into a bet. The perfectly calibrated intent by the Safdies, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ronald Bronstein, is to remix genre and pulpy sensibilities. At its heart, this is a crime movie despite its protagonist mostly just trying to dodge the criminals long enough to get paid, but the movie is also poignant as it contrasts scuzzy New York with far older institutions in the Jewish faith and tradition. At times quite gentle, one of Gems’ best scenes is Sandler sitting in the home of his father-in-law (Judd Hirsch) and reflecting, along with the audience, about the irony of playing games he’s already won. When he sees his wife still able to fit in her bat mitzvah dress, he spontaneously begins proposing a reconciliation. Menzel, doing good work here between Elsa’s high notes, laughs with affectionate hate, “I think you must be the most annoying man alive.” Of course she’s right: Howie that guy who renegotiates a bet even after he wins, and the one who wants it all, be it his wife and his girlfriend, or his opal and the money he owes Arno. But through the sheer strength of Sandler’s performance, we can’t help but love this frustrating sonofabitch. The ingenuity of Sandler’s turn is how it makes you bet on what should be a lost cause. An even stronger supporting cast that includes sterling bit turns by Stanfield, Hirsch, Bogosian, and newcomer Fox as the closest to an innocent in all this creates a memorable cinematic landscape of lowlifes, lechers, and true New Yorkers. The surprise among them though is Kevin Garnett. The above about using an actor’s persona in a striking way? It also applies to KG, who despite playing himself gives a subtle portrait of a guy shocked to learn the Diamond District has a gutter, and he’s now drowning in it. The Safdies reveal the scheming of all these people with enough empathy to prevent this from coming off as cynical exploitation or a simple confidence game. Rather the directors are as beguiled by these people as Howie and KG are by “the Black Jew Opal.” That chunk of rock is often filmed (and scored by composer Daniel Lopatin) with the reverence of a New Age prophet. And maybe there is a mystical power in this nutty movie that takes archetypes, genre staples, and even movie stars and builds from their raw materials something wholly original, and coolly dazzling.",POSITIVE
"Nov 12, 2019",This felt like a one-of-a-kind experience thanks to the Safdie brothers' style.,POSITIVE
"Nov 1, 2019"," If the Safdie brothers’ 2017 feature Good Time was akin to drinking a triple shot espresso, their latest film Uncut Gems is like mainlining pure adrenaline for the entirety of its 134-minute runtime. It’s a disorientating, sensory overload which picks up the audience and hurls them through a kaleidoscope of thumping sound and gaudy visuals. Indie filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie bring out a magnificent, career-best performance from Adam Sandler as the central wheeler-dealer in one of the tensest films of the decade. Set in 2012, Uncut Gems follows quick-witted New York City jeweller Howard Ratner (Sandler) who lives a frantic lifestyle juggling his jewellery shop business and failing marriage against a gambling addiction and an array of get-rich-quick schemes. He also spends his days evading debt collectors to whom he owes thousands of dollars and maintaining an affair with his young employee Julia (Julia Fox, making a fantastic debut).  Howard senses an escape from this exhausting grind in the form of an unrefined opal-encrusted rock which he’s purchased from an Ethiopian mine and plans to flog for millions. But when NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (keenly playing himself) takes an interest in the opal, it kick-starts a sequence of bad decisions, disastrous mishaps and go for broke bets. Uncut Gems is an absolute masterclass in anxiety-inducing filmmaking, so much so it should probably come with a health warning. The mesmerising, relentlessly noisy sound design is filled with a constant barrage of voices yelling over the top of each other as deals are made and jewellery flogged. While some may find the discord of the sound design off-putting, it perfectly captures the pandemonium of Howard’s everyday life and is expertly mixed, so important exchanges always remain audible. Electronic musician Oneohtrix Point Never, who also worked on Good Time, constructs a pounding, synthy and pulse-racing score which brilliantly melds with the chaos on-screen. Darius Khonji’s slick cinematography glides round the action skilfully, capturing every disorderly moment with flair. The script, penned by the Safdies along with regular collaborator Ronald Bronstein, superbly balances the intensity and hilarity of the film. One scene, where Howard is juggling multiple phone calls along with the arrival of Garnett and multiple debt collectors at his showroom, is a brilliantly orchestrated scene of excruciating stress and manic comedy. Sandler completely thrives in this tragicomic dynamic with a riveting, hilarious and charismatic performance. The Safdie brothers clearly have a talent for creating engaging, complex characters but it’s Sandler’s fast-talking, hot-headed yet vulnerable turn which makes this schemer so authentic and relatable. His multifaceted performance slowly wins you over and by the film’s conclusion, we are as invested and enthralled as he is during the climatic high-stakes gamble. The Safdie brothers have composed a heart-pounding, nerve-shredding, deceptively funny masterpiece with a compelling, all-time best performance from Sandler. Uncut Gems is a truly electrifying trip which should catapult the Safdie brothers into the mainstream as experts of high-octane cinema.",POSITIVE
"Oct 31, 2019"," Fresh from the success of the terrific Heaven Knows What and the wonderfully absorbing Good Time, the Safdie Brothers’ latest film is a roller-coaster of thrills from start to finish, proving themselves once again to be true masters of suspense cinema, capable of unnerving any audience.  In Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler plays a jewellery dealer with a mountain of debts, facing a race against time for his life, in a New York-based crime thriller that carries a level of grit not seen in Hollywood for many years. It has a particularly authentic feel to it, thanks in large part to the raw and chaotic style that the Safdie Brothers have now perfected. This is an absolute masterclass in tense, pulse-racing cinema, designed to discomfort the viewer in the best way imaginable. It’s genuinely edge-of-your-seat stuff, and the erratic nature of it all is at once unsafe, unnerving and unpredictable.  In amongst the thrills are plenty of legitimate laughs, in what could only be considered a black comedy in the strongest possible sense. It’s certainly not for everyone, carrying with it the potential of being either your favourite film of the year or your least favourite, but those who find themselves wrapped up in it will find it impossible to forget.  Of course, the main talking point with this film is that of the terrific central performance from Adam Sandler, who proves once again that, when given strong material, he is an extremely capable dramatic actor. Much like Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories, the range in his performance is admirable, and much credit must go to the Safdie Brothers for their work with actors, as we saw with Robert Pattinson’s career-defining turn in Good Time. Adam Sandler is a difficult man for film lovers to like. In many ways, the films he makes and the way he conducts those productions represents the very worst of Hollywood and just how shallow mainstream cinema has become, but its testament to his performance that these preconceived opinions are largely forgotten after about three minutes, with films like Grown Ups and Jack and Jill a distant memory. He is outstanding in this film, in a role that utilises both his dramatic and comedic talents, and that’s really all that matters.  Uncut Gems is utterly relentless from start to finish; a true force of nature that is excruciating to sit through yet impossible to look away from. Its provocative style will prove no doubt to be divisive, but those who engage with it will be rewarded with one of the most high-pressure, adrenaline-fueled American films in years.  We hope you're enjoying BRWC.

"Oct 18, 2019"," Uncut Gems, the latest film from the Safdie brothers, doesn’t take long to disorient you for a different kind of movie. After a brief prologue, the camera zooms into the black opal at the center of the film, a psychedelic and majestic sequence that transitions from the gem itself into the middle of a colonoscopy being performed on Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) while he’s unconscious. Safe to say, it’s certainly a choice. There are certainly a lot of those unexpected choices that, when compiled together, should not work. At the center of Uncut Gems is a loudmouthed and largely unlikable jewelry store owner and compulsive gambler who, at any point, could hoist himself out of his own mess. The entire film rides on Sandler, who had become something of a punchline in recent years (although his 2018 Netflix standup special 100% Fresh started to turn that around). Yet it does just that with Sandler giving an all-time performance and Uncut Gems revealing those specs of humanity beneath a hard and often ugly and anxiety-inducing surface. Howard Ratner has shades we’ve seen Sandler play before: He’s obnoxious, abrasive, and entirely incapable of handling stressful situations at a normal volume, even after he promises to keep his voice lowered. His wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) can’t stand him anymore and is this close to announcing their divorce, which they’re putting off until after Passover is over. He lives in an unforgiving New York City, one with hints of a seedy underbelly, one that he can’t quit. He pisses off his girlfriend Julia (Julia Fox), who’s also one of several employees who put up with his antics at work, and he somehow manages to spin his increasingly worse predicament to his advantage despite the fact that he has a couple of loan sharks breathing down their neck who aren’t willing to hold back their punches. You see, Howard owes them a lot of money—more than a lot of us can fathom throwing into a single bet. Yet, Sandler makes Howard Ratner completely mesmerizing to watch; you want to see his next trick, watch the outcome of his latest bet, and whether he can really pull it off this time. It’s as harrowing as watching the clock go down in an NBA game, and he even finds a certain kinship with NBA superstar Kevin Garnett, who’s playing himself (and is on top of his game in a role that is full of nuance) on the cusp of making the Finals. It’s not just that either of them won or have proven themselves—they both have, to varying degrees—but that they need to win so much that their greatness isn’t in dispute. A meeting at Howard’s jewelry store brings him and Garnett together, the latter believing that the opal will help him achieve the title and glory he’s spent all season trying to achieve. It’s the catalyst for everything that follows, which occasionally veers into the absurd. But it’s also a heart-pounding thrill ride, one that raises the tension with each new development until it becomes almost unbearable to watch if it weren’t for bouts of humor in the right moments. But you’ll watch it anyway. Not just because it’s compelling or you enjoy the narrative, although that’s part of the draw. We’re drawn to the adrenaline rush that trying to keep up with the game gives you. With the NBA frame within Uncut Gems, it argues both why we’re hooked on high-intensity sports matchups as well as high-stakes movies: We don’t know quite how it will play out, but half the victory is in the experience of watching it. And for Uncut Gems, it more than earns the roller coaster it puts its audience on. Michelle Jaworski is a staff writer and TV/film critic at the Daily Dot.

"Oct 15, 2019"," As much as American cinema is based in LA, it’s New York that has always been the country’s most iconic on-screen destination. How well they use this manic city can be a real test for a filmmaker. For a long time, the premiere chronicler of NYC was, of course, Martin Scorsese. Taking his title in this new generation are the Safdie brothers. New York is the lifeblood of their oeuvre and Uncut Gems is their best film, one of the best New York films ever made. Following a whirlwind couple of days in the life of diamond dealer and apocalyptically self-destructive gambler Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), Uncut Gems is a lightspeed sensory assault from start to finish. The noises of the city, its bright lights, and the chaos of Howard’s life batter the audience, locking you into your seat with unbelievably tense set-pieces. It is so frantically intense that you can barely breathe, and you’re left physically drained by the experience. Yet it’s also utterly exhilarating, the Safdies barrelling through their narrative with miraculous speed and skill, always pushed further and further by the varied, thrilling score. Darius Khondji’s cinematography leaps from gritty to stunningly gorgeous abstraction without ever pausing for breath, a perfect match for the exhausting story. Sandler has never been better than he is here, making Howard eminently unlikable without ever stopping you rooting for him. It’s a magnificent performance around which the nail-biting chaos of the story is built and he is captivating from start to finish. It’s hard to remember the last time a film consistently kept up tension for this long (even Fury Road took a couple of breaks). With Uncut Gems, the Safdies are operating on another level entirely, making a film that is, quite simply, a force of nature. SYNOPSIS: A charismatic New York City jeweller, always on the lookout for the next big score, makes a series of high-stakes bets that could lead to the windfall of a lifetime. Howard must perform a precarious high-wire act, balancing business, family, and encroaching adversaries on all sides, in his relentless pursuit of the ultimate win.",POSITIVE
"Oct 13, 2019"," He may have developed a reputation for appearing in financially successful but critically derided films, but when Adam Sandler gets it right, he’s a supreme and magnetic Hollywood talent. In The Safdie Brothers' Uncut Gems, the follow-up from their excellent Robert Pattinson crime thriller Good Time,Adam Sandler plays a jewellery store owner, gambler, and generally rather ridiculous crook Howard ""Howie"" Ratner - a superb creation with protruding teeth and ostentatious trinkets who is looking to make some big money after obtaining an Ethiopian uncut gem that he intends to sell at auction. But with Howie facing complications in the form of disgruntled family members, local gangsters, and unreliable employees with celebrity connections, alongside an estranged wife, and an unreliable mistress, can he really risk it all on his biggest gamble yet? In terms of performances, this is really a snow globe for Sandler to show off his talents as an actor, utilising his comedic timing with an unadulterated charisma but also allowing for some moving moments where Howie lays his soul bare. Other actors in the cast give some strong supporting performances but are mostly underused. Lakeith Stanfield is a great sparring partner for Howie as one of his untrustworthy associates, Demany, while Eric Bogosian is a believably irritated relative of Howie's who is finally calling in old debts. Sadly, the women in the film ultimately feel rather underwritten. Idina Menzel displays her acting chops as Howie’s exasperated estranged wife Dinah, but is never given more to do than just be irritated at his antics. Meanwhile, newcomer Julia Fox displays excellent comic timing and presence as Howie’s mistress and employee Julia, particularly in the later scenes, but the character is rather one-note. The Safdie Brothers are clearly influenced by the grimy crime dramas of New Hollywood cinema, particularly the works of Martin Scorsese who serves as an executive producer here, keeping a focus on gritty aesthetics, crime, violence, dark comedy, and the masculinity of the dangerous world that Howie navigates. The issue with the film that will cause contention and irritation is the hyper-invasive retro synth score (with shades of Vangelis) alongside the noisy group verbal exchanges, which are used to amplify the tension and frenetic unease to an extreme degree. This will alienate many but keep others hooked in, especially as events spiral and seem to go increasingly wrong for Howie. The Safdies also mostly avoid a traditional plot, with events seemingly meandering within the chaotic life of Howie, as he tries to keep a hold of his gem and then make enough money from it to leave his troubles behind him. This all occurs while Howie occasionally collides with the world of showbiz, with a fiery cameo from music star The Weeknd and an amusing supporting role for basketball player Kevin Garnett. With events building to an explosive finale that may be the tensest cinema sequence of the year, Uncut Gems is a testament to The Safdie Brothers’ talents at creating an anxiety-inducing experience but definitely won’t be for everyone. Uncut Gems is an acquired taste as it aims to provoke audience anxiety and concern, but those in its thrall are rewarded with laugh-out-loud moments, the edge of your seat tension, and a great showcase for Adam Sandler’s talents.",POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2019","The finest film yet from the Safdie Brothers, and one that rewards any audiences who remain after the audacious, abrasive opening. Well, ""rewards"" might not be the best word for it - you'll definitely need a stiff drink and a sit down afterwards.",POSITIVE
"Oct 12, 2019"," The closest example of such a film that is as big of a complete mess as this is that of last year’s Sorry to Bother You, that’s my closest comparison to the utterly incoherent mess that is this soulless and artificial Scorsese rip. Cashing in on a the New York setting, Uncut Gems takes the constant-talking archetype to another level, but not an elevated one. In fact, it comes across as a poorly directed attempt to create deeper psychological meaning in the constant harassment and struggle of one man’s life, yet it’s all hollow and completely flat-lines in trying to build tension through the non-stop chatter and noise. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is the owner of a showroom, based in the Diamond District in Manhatten, New York City. He is a gambler, a gambler like no other and this has an impact on his hectic New York life. A matter of multiple gambling schemes get Howard into trouble, he makes somewhat treacherous moves in betraying trust to earn for himself. Recently he came into knowing of a gem, a black opal. From an Ethiopian mine, of which he wishes to gain a truck load of money from. Coming off of the success of Good Time, the Safdie brothers have delivered an absolute incoherent mess of a film. A film that made me consider getting up and leaving, due to the incomprehensible chopped-up nature of the edit. Some may say it’s for the purpose of tension, the constant bickering and noises, yet I never felt an ounce of tension. All that was felt was a hollow sludge pile of something trying to create meaning and a message under the guise of chaos, but it never works. There are a few funny lines scattered throughout, that’s about all that works – Sandler is one-note and almost sketch-like. All he does is stumble around, talking non-stop and he never stops, he is a protagonist of no depth and is merely all surface layer. It’s a masculine-fueled macho ride of nothingness, adding to the terrible filmmaking craft on display is the sexualised view of its female characters. They are capitalised upon as objects and are nothing more than things to desire, there is no underlying message or meaning in subtext in the way they are viewed, if they intended anything they sure did fail. Uncut Gems is an utterly incoherent mess, it’s one of the worst films I’ve seen in a long time. It tries to be tense, but fails due to the hollow nature of the film’s execution.",NEGATIVE
"Oct 10, 2019"," As it did for Jonah, shipwrecked and storm-tossed in the dark Phoenician Sea, salvation comes to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) in the belly of a fish. Near the start of Uncut Gems, the outstanding new film from Josh and Benny Safdie, the creature turns up packed in ice at Howard’s workshop and showroom in New York’s diamond district. Its arrival has been keenly awaited for the past 17 months, because hidden inside its stomach cavity is a 4,500-carat black opal. Howard has had this smuggled into the country from an Ethiopian mine, and now plans to sell it at auction for a seven-figure sum.  The stone is as yet unrefined, but its rainbow refractions exert a mesmerising pull. “They say you can see the whole universe in opals, that’s how old they are,” Howard tells the basketball star Kevin Garnett – playing himself – who has been brought in to peruse the bling by Howard’s streetwise fixer Demany (Lakeith Stanfield). Garnett takes Howard’s loupe, peers into the rock, and sees infinity within. Howard smiles. “That’s a million dollar opal you’re holding,” the jeweller says. “Real old-school, Middle Earth s___.” Howard, too, is old-school to the bone. A compulsive gambler perpetually balanced on a knife edge between glory and ruin, he puts his faith in the kind of wealth you can weigh: gold chains, diamonds, wads of currency as thick as cake. And like Howard, it’s all constantly on the move; a one-man bubble economy that could burst at any moment. He owes a substantial debt to an unsavoury relative, Arno (Eric Bogosian), who has retained the services of two heavies to recoup it chunk by chunk.  But there’s also his vinegary wife Dinah (Idina Menzel) and their three children to worry about, living in a triumphantly crass Long Island mansion – oh, and his hot-stuff mistress Julia (Julia Fox), who resides rent-free in his absurd Manhattan pied-à-terre, with its Duran-Duran-meets-Darth-Vader decor. And since the sale of the opal will set everything right, it of course immediately goes missing, throwing every aspect of Howard’s existence into chaos. Deals are reneged on, deadlines missed, deeply unpleasant types enraged. The result, as Howard ricochets between crises, is one of the most exquisitely tense films I have ever seen: by the end, I felt as if I’d spent two hours being dangled by my ankles over a crocodile pit. The Safdies are native New Yorkers, raised in the city’s Jewish community in the 1980s and 90s – Josh is 35, Benny 33 – and they have spent their careers to date somehow finding previously unseen ways to shoot perhaps the most extensively filmed city on Earth. The alien chill that blew through their last two features, Heaven Knows What and Good Time, is more palpable than ever before – here the city is a megalopolis worthy of science fiction; a berserk criss-cross of streets surging with strangers. Daniel Lopatin’s wondrous synth-driven score evokes Blade Runner and Akira, while cinematographer Darius Khondji shoots the action with spy-cam intimacy, capturing every reflection that slips across Howard’s frameless spectacles. But the film’s deranged and diamond-studded centrepiece is Howard himself, who is brought to life by a mythologically great Sandler performance – better even than his career-redefining role in 2002’s Punch-Drunk Love. There is no actor alive better than Sandler at delving into that readily identifiable modern masculine type – call him the malebomb – whose short fuse and unstable contents make him a combustible threat to his own safety, and ours. Howard is a classic of the type, and the Safdies’ and Ronald Bronstein’s profanity-slathered script leaves no part of him off-limits – and I do mean no part. An Ethiopia-set prologue shows the excavation of the opal itself, but after the camera loses itself inside the stone, the image becomes pink and slippery, and we suddenly find ourselves inside Howard’s colon, where a doctor is examining some bothersome polyps during a medical check-up. But its laughs and shocks never feel performed: they’re just more beautiful, idiosyncratic details that pull you even deeper into Howard’s world. Like Martin Scorsese’s New York films of the 1970s and 1980s – notably, Scorsese serves as an executive producer – Uncut Gems captures the city at a moment of meltdown, and does it so vividly and envelopingly, it’s as if you’re melting down with it. It’s an almost surreally abrasive way to bring in the new decade, and a cinematic time capsule to be treasured by film-loving generations to come – providing they can survive until the end of it. ",POSITIVE

Josh and Benny Safdie, the indie filmmaking brothers whose New York City movies shudder with attitude, tell fast and grubby stories that harken back to the 1970s, when Sidney Lumet ruled sets. Their vigor is an instant rush: why creep a camera down a hallway when you can fling it behind equally unhinged characters? In ‘Heaven Knows What’, the Safdies turned uptown heroin junkies into wild, unkempt angels. Then, in ‘Good Time’, they gave Robert Pattinson all the confusion he could handle as a Pacino-like Queens hustler out of his depth. There’s no nostalgia to these films, no cuteness, only the mania of urban survival, improvised on the fly with a side of trash talk. ‘Uncut Gems’, the Safdies’ electrifying and abrasive latest drama, flirts with becoming a headache. (For some, it will feel like more than flirting.) But the film gets closer than the brothers ever have to developing a genuine affection for their various schemers, and that makes all the difference. Tenaciously, it follows a week in the 2012 life of a fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants Diamond District dealer, Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler, channeling his obnoxiousness into something magically right, even moving). You may be overwhelmed by the Safdies’s spiky sound design – filled with yelling, sports betting, the jewelry shop’s constantly buzzing security door and an overcaffeinated, Tangerine Dream–like synth score – but Howard thrives in this chaos. It’s his normal. Beyond his bling salesmanship, Howard dreams of a big score, which arrives by messenger from Ethiopia: a gleaming chunk of opal-encrusted rock which he hopes to auction off for a fortune. (It’s ‘real old-school Middle-earth shit’, he tells the hypnotized NBA star Kevin Garnett, playing himself with self-deprecating charm.) The various whereabouts of this stone will become a plot spine for ‘Uncut Gems’, but that’s just an excuse to ping-pong Howard between a kaleidoscopic cross-section of sharply etched neurotics: pawnshop kibitzers, menacing debt collectors (led by a spookily intense Eric Bogosian), a semi-estranged wife (Idina Menzel, seeping fury from every pore) and a brassy mistress, also his shop’s counter clerk, who may be falling in love with him (Julia Fox, making a stellar debut). Gamblers at heart, the Safdies have a palpable love of gamesmanship, of arguments pushed to the brink, verbal beatdowns and courtside chatter. (Gifted cinematographer Darius Khondji, a master of reflections, gives ‘Uncut Gems’ a sheen that visually counterbalances.) Something else is going on here, too: a lovably pronounced American Jewishness in terms of tone and touchstones, from Billy Joel’s showbizzy ‘The Stranger’, heard during a car ride back to Long Island, to a family’s Passover seder rife with marital tensions and kids running around searching for the afikomen. This was the environment in which the Safdies grew up; their film isn’t merely an outstanding portrait of a charming fate-tempter who goes a bit too far, but a kind of autobiography (as was their 2009 breakthrough, ‘Daddy Longlegs’). It’s made with so much love, care and enthusiasm – plus no small amount of risk – you thrill to think that they’re just getting started.

"Oct 5, 2019"," You’re not dreaming. Billy Madison, Mr. Deeds, Happy Gilmore, Robbie Hart and the guy that sang “The Hanukkah Song” is doing the finest work of his career in “Uncut Gems,” a new crime comedy co-written and directed by Joshua and Benny Safdie. Pigs have flown, for Sandler is brilliant. This is not a “Who’s that guy?” dramatic shift that funnymen often make in more serious films, such as Robin Williams as a bald creep in “One Hour Photo” or Jim Carrey as a cop in “Dark Crimes.” It’s simply that Sandler has finally found material suited to his prodigious talents that’s actually good — as a sleazebag New York diamond dealer whose life is one big, bad decision. His name is Howard, and he’s as ethical as a Chicago mayor. Loud, sweaty and obnoxious, he sells diamonds at high prices at his Midtown shop, often to major celebs such retired basketball star Kevin Garnett. One day in 2012, Howard receives a shipment from Africa: a rare, rainbow-hued opal he believes is worth millions. There is a certain magic to the rock. When Garnett stares into the shimmering stone, he’s transfixed. The Boston Celtics star needs to have the enchanting item, so Howard trades the opal for Garnett’s championship ring, temporarily, until the basketball player can win the gem when it’s on the auction block. That’s too easy, though. Like many a foul-mouthed, corrupt jerk before him, Howard owes a lot of people a lot of money. Looking to pay off his debts — and not get killed — he pawns off Garnett’s ring and bets with the money in hopes of getting the bling back with cash to spare. The directors and Sandler really floor it through all of these events with a thriller’s tension — speaking at breakneck speed and dispensing swears like Skittles. But there is aplomb amid the F-bombs and wit beneath the “s – – t.” The script is very smart and the perfect length, and every single character is textured and memorable, especially the women. Idina Menzel plays Howard’s suffering wife, Dinah, who holds down the fort at the family’s Long Island home, while Howard is off having sex with his young assistant, Julia (Julia Fox), in his New York not-quite-a-bachelor pad. Both ladies are delightfully abrasive. There’s a quiet moment in which an irritated Menzel looks into Sandler’s eyes that puts the audience in stitches. And another heart-stopping — but hysterical — scene sees two thugs follow Howard into his kid’s middle-school play. Fox’s Julia even almost hooks up with the Weeknd in a nightclub bathroom, causing an epic drunken couple tiff. Through all the madness, the film has a gritty, florescent look that contrasts with the hilarity. And then there’s Sandler’s Howard, a superb comedic creation on par with George Costanza or Oscar Madison. When the actor focuses his near-nuclear supply of energy, as he does here, it’s an incredible sight. Kudos to him for putting his still-considerable weight in Hollywood behind adventurous projects like “Uncut Gems” instead of, you know, “Little Nicky.”",POSITIVE
"Sep 27, 2019"," Josh and Benny Safdie’s new movie is another compelling and grisly NYC pulp crime thriller, with a career-best Adam Sandler as a wheeling and dealing jeweller taking a steep bet against fate. TIFF is probably the first place on earth where you might hear Adam Sandler touted as a contender for the Best Actor Academy Award. It could happen. Uncut Gems finds him in a ‘serious’ dramatic role, at the centre of an intense, jittery thriller from New York indie filmmakers the Safdie Brothers, Josh and Benny, who previously scored a minor hit with Robert Pattinson (Good Time) and earned raves for their grungy Heaven Knows What. Uncut Gems has a similar edgy, propulsive, bebop beat: it’s falling over itself to tell the tale, the kind of morbid barroom anecdote you can imagine the hoods from Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas sharing. (Scorsese has an executive producer credit here.) This relatively simple goal is complicated by Howard’s greatest weakness and greatest vice. He is an an attention-seeker and a gambler, and like the driven antiheroes in the two movies of that name (and in the Dostoyevski novel before them) he just can’t resist the urge to get one over on fate. When NBA star Kevin Garnett walks into his showroom to buy a watch, Howard makes the mistake of gifting him a glimpse of the opals. Garnett is so smitten he insists on taking them to tonight’s game as a kind of talisman, and the jeweller figures he can rub that charm into a sizeable payoff… It’s a disastrous misjudgment. Fans of Abel Ferrari’s Bad Lieutenant will dig how the Safdies dovetail Howard’s careening fortunes with a real-life NBA series from 2012, and the two films share a similar vibe, even if the Lieutenant’s Catholic masochism is very different from Howard’s compulsive need for 50 shades of more: attention, love, respect, oneupmanship, money, call it what you will. This reviewer isn’t qualified to dissect the character’s Jewish identity except to note that it’s clearly something the Safdies care about. Howard is no gangster; he wants to live a good life in the eyes of family and friends. Yet somehow he winds up locked in the trunk of his own SUV, naked, in the carpark at his kids’ school play, just one of several tragicomic humiliations he must endure. Scorsese, Toback, Reisz, Ferrara… the Safdies don’t look out of place in this company; they are right at home in the discomfort zone. Uncut Gems is a prime slab of concentrated pulp storytelling in 135 New York minutes, gripping and remorseless, and probably the cruellest, funniest joke of Adam Sandler’s career.",POSITIVE

"Sep 27, 2019"," Uncut Gems glows from the opening seconds of its title sequence onwards. Directors Josh and Benny Safdie guide us down a glittering rabbit hole into the heart of a precious opal to begin this masterful work of filmmaking, and leave us there stunned by its brilliance. Adam Sandler takes the lead as Howard Ratner, a jewellery store owner in New York who deals in rare gems and dabbles in various suspect tradings across the city. Howard is spinning an endless number of plates; what bills are owed, which bets are placed, what collateral he has stored and where. The Safdies are adept at creating such intensely stressful environments and interactions, as Howard’s business operations become even more perilous and his blind fearlessness gets the better of him. This is not a film that ever pauses to take a breath, and it is so cleverly and frustratingly done that it’s enough to make you want to scream in your seat. With their previous feature, Good Time, the Safdie brothers established some stylistic trademarks that they carry over to great effect here. Notably the brothers work again with Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) for the score that brings a similarly mystical grit to Uncut Gems. Grainy close-ups and their taste for green-tinted lighting are employed again too, which create a satisfying visual language for the film of criminal grime. It’s a great performance by Sandler too, with Idina Menzel also standing out in a slightly limited role as Howard’s wife, and a star turn by former professional basketball player Kevin Garnett. This is a sharp and maniacal film that manages to be so intelligently controlled in its hysteria; a tightly constructed examination of obsession, addiction, and arrogance. Uncut Gems is so ambitiously crafted and well-executed, a very special film indeed.",POSITIVE
"Sep 26, 2019"," Sandler can bring it: Punch-Drunk Love wasn’t a fluke and You Don’t Mess With The Zohan ain’t nothing to sniff at. Alternating between soft-spoken schlub and raging ass is a Sandler specialty. Like Punch-Drunk Love director Paul Thomas Anderson, the Safdie Brothers know how to exploit that for something great. The filmmaking duo – the electrifying heirs apparent to Scorsese – spin an even bigger, seemingly more out-of-control thriller than their last outing Good Time. Sandler plays a New York City jeweller gaming his customers, family and friends while betting against his own life at every turn. The movie is dark and wickedly funny. And Uncut Gems is long but never drags there’s so much propulsive, forward momentum even when the characters never get anywhere.",POSITIVE
"Sep 25, 2019"," Sometimes a film is so energetic it's like a triple-shot of espresso injected straight into your veins. At this year's Toronto International Film Festival, that film was Uncut Gems, a movie so high-energy and stressful your hands will sweat for hours after you leave the theater. The NYC-based independent filmmakers known as the Safdie brothers have made several movies about down-on-their-luck guys with an affinity for making one terrible decision after another. Their newest film, Uncut Gems, is in a similar vein. It quickly becomes an endurance test for the audience, as it continuously pushes your willingness to watch someone having the absolute worst time of their life. That may sound awful, but the experience of watching a Safdie brothers movie is like riding a roller coaster. It's an adrenaline-spiked gauntlet from which you can’t escape, but when you come out on the other side, you feel glad you took the ride. The duo's latest target is Howard (Adam Sandler), a jeweler in New York who acquires a rare Ethiopian black opal through shady means. Howard is convinced this will be an easy sell--after all, NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself) becomes obsessed with the gem the moment he lays eyes on it. Howard desperately needs to sell it, as he's neck-deep in debt to some muscle-heavy collectors who keep threatening to break his legs, and he spends all the money he earns through his store on sports bets. Instead of simply selling the gem and paying his debts, however, he borrows the money he’s planning on making before the sale and bets it on a Celtics game--hoping the earnings will be enough to pay off the creditors and also buy his wife's (Idina Menzel) and mistress's (Julia Fox) affection. A big part of the fun--and the tension--of Uncut Gems comes from Sandler's performance. The famous comedian delivers his best performance since Punch-Drunk Love, utilizing his man-child persona with a squawking voice and knack for shouting every other line to embody the role of a man who thinks himself to be the only swindler in a room full of hustlers. Credit should go to both Sandler's sympathetic performance and the Safdies' directing, as they manage to make the audience feel bad for Howard. No matter how deep in trouble he gets, to hate on him would be like kicking a man when he's down--only this man thinks he is at the very top. The great performances extend to the rest of the cast. Special credit should go to Kevin Garnett, who makes an impressive feature debut playing off his NBA stardom by acting like a junkie every time he lays his eyes on the black opal, descending into an obsessive frenzy that matches Sandler's exaggerated mannerisms. Cinematographer Darius Khondji gives us courtside tickets to the madness unfolding around Howard, getting up close and personal as wave after wave of overlapping dialogue makes the New York of Uncut Gems seem not only real and lived-in, but chaotic. Filmed in actual New York City, Uncut Gems pays meticulous detail to the frantic life of the city and the tight community that runs Manhattan's Diamond District, showing us the day to day life of the owners of the tiny stands and stores where everyone knows each other. Cameos by real people (asides from Garnett's presence, The Weeknd also has a cameo) help make this feel like a real version of New York. Khondji's kinetic camerawork feels like an extension of Howard's energy, moving as quick as Howard can throw insults at the people around him, not giving the audience a moment to catch their breath, as we're meant to feel just as anxious and exhausted as Howard. The almost ethereal, synth-heavy score by Daniel Lopatin helps give the movie a sense of heightened reality, one that is even messier than ours, with enthralling, captivating sounds. Even if you don't think of Uncut Gems as a movie that would rely on visual effects, the cosmic beauty of the Ethiopian black opal is fully explored as an otherworldly aesthetic that fascinates everyone who comes into contact with it. Probably the best scene of the movie involves a look at the microscopic world inside the gem, which Khondji shoots full of color and wonder, right before it turns into something way nastier--just like Howard’s world. Uncut Gems is an endurance test. It's a thrill ride that wants you to see how long you can keep watching an irritating man make stupid decisions before pulling all of the hair off your head. And the Safdie brothers aren’t interested in paying this off with a calm, rewarding finale. This is Howard’s world, and it is a cruel place that punishes those who try to pull one over on it. Walking out of the theater, the movie's stress and tension will remain with you for a while. This is not a feel-good movie, but one that leaves you with the sensation that you just experienced two filmmakers and a star at the height of their craft. Uncut Gems will get your heart pumping from 0 to 80 in seconds, and it will be hard to forget such an achievement.",POSITIVE
"Sep 24, 2019"," Back at it for another day at TIFF 2019, I started the day bright and early with The Truth from Hirokazu Koreeda. From there, I had to run to catch the new film from directors Josh and Benny Safdie, Uncut Gems. It was quite a shakeup, both tonally and in terms of subject, but it was a double feature I looked forward to as soon as the schedule came out. Hirokazu Koreeda may be the best director in the world when it comes to an adept look at family dynamics. His 2018 film, Shoplifters, won the Palme D’or at Cannes and was a huge hit. Shortly after, he announced his next film would be his first film outside of Japan and in another language.Taking place largely in French (there’s some English mixed in) and featuring talent like Juliette Binoche, Catherine Deneuve and Ethan Hawke, The Truth is Koreeda’s greatest departure from his previous work, while simultaneously fitting right in with his filmography.When screenwriter Lumir (Binoche) comes back with her husband and daughter to her home in Paris to visit her legendary actress mother Fabienne (Deneuve), the reunion isn’t quite all hugs and kisses. Fabienne is about to publish her memoir, which Lumir finds to be less than honest. Fabienne looks back at herself as a far more involved and loving mother than Lumir remembers.On top of that, Fabienne – who is past the prime in her career and has a reputation of being difficult – has a supporting role in a new movie. Fabienne is vain and impossible to please – she seemingly thinks she’s above being a mother because of her career. It feels like a battle of cats (mom, being cold and distant) vs. dogs (Lumir needing the warmth and affection).Over the course of the film, the two come to realize that they each view their relationship from their unique perspectives. They argue over their memories (which can’t be trusted), \ over tiny details like the size of a studio lot. When the two manage to open up to each other, they see that neither of their perspectives are actually the titular truth.Obviously great talent like Binoche and Deneuve shine brightly. The roles aren’t flashy or wild, but they’re played perfectly true to life. While she doesn’t play a major role, it would be a disservice not to mention Clémentine Grenier who plays Charlotte, the daughter of Lumir and Hank (Hawke). For a young actress in a bilingual role, she knocks it out of the park with a performance far beyond her experience.With The Truth, Koreeda has crafted another subtle, yet poignant look at the family structure. It may never reach the highs of Shoplifters, but it’s certainly worthy of a place in his catalog. It’s surprisingly (and impressively) French – muted tones and a bit grainy. You could put The Truth next to a Claire Denis film and it would aesthetically fit in. It’s as quietly brilliant as you’ve come to expect from the Japanese director with understated, yet pointed performances and intimate, nuanced camerawork.Uncut Gems (Josh and Benny Safdie)Uncut Gems (2019) – source: A24If you’ve ever seen a film from Josh and Benny Safdie, you roughly know what you’re getting into. That’s not a bad thing. They’ve carved out a niche that’s built them quite the following – myself included. And after seeing what they did with Robert Pattinson in Good Time, I couldn’t wait to see what they had in store for Adam Sandler in Uncut Gems.The Safdie Brothers return to New York city for the story of Howard Ratner (Sandler), an eccentric jeweler in the Diamond District. He’s the kind of guy who always has a scheme going on. He’s always looking for a score. He also happens to bit a bit of trouble with gambling debt and starting to go through a divorce. So when he gets the titular uncut gem, –an opal –it leads to a series of big bets that risk everything. Howard has to walk a fine line and balance different people trying to get him to settle up, Kevin Garnett and his personal life.Like all Safdie films, Uncut Gems is a relentless panic attack. It pushes it’s characters past their limits and examines if they’ll sink or swim. I love it, but it’s not for everyone. The score melts your ears while frenetic action doesn’t let up. The performances make you believe. Garnett plays himself and the gem from Howard for good luck in the NBA Eastern Conference Championship. It’s a harder role than you’d expect and he feels natural to the story, not like a celebrity cameo.Sandler comes off as a grimy, but well intentioned schemer. New York City is full of them, and he’d fit right in. Believe the Oscar hype for Sandler. Even though he likely won’t get a nomination, he’s worthy of one. He balances a complicated character that, like Pattinson in Good Time, we never know if we want them to win or lose. Amidst the frantic pace, there are plenty of jokes and moments of levity. Without giving away too much, there’s a scene where he’s sexting from inside a closet that is laugh out loud funny.While it’s not as tight and tidy as Good Time or Heaven Knows What, adding humor is a big step forward for the Safdie Brothers with Uncut Gems. It’s certainly funnier – largely thanks to Sandler – than anything they’ve done before. It also needs to be to help viewers through the 134 minute runtime. There’s only so long a viewer can take the frenetic pace of a Safdie Brothers film.It’s all so intentionally stressful, but it’s hard to say that having so many characters yelling over each other so frequently always works. There are plenty of times I wanted subtitles or sound mixing to make it clearer what each character was saying. I recognize what the directors were going for, they just need to find that balance.Uncut Gems is everything you’d expect and hope for from the Safdie Brothers. It will get your heart rate going and your adrenaline pumping. Skip your morning coffee and keep a Xanax in your pocket. If you’ve seen Sandler in Punch Drunk Love or Meyerowitz Stories, you know he’s a talented actor. And in Uncut Gems, he’s at the very top of his game.Does content like this matter to you?Become a Member and support film journalism. Unlock access to all of Film Inquiry`s great articles.

Sandler comes off as a grimy, but well intentioned schemer. New York City is full of them, and he’d fit right in. Believe the Oscar hype for Sandler. Even though he likely won’t get a nomination, he’s worthy of one. He balances a complicated character that, like Pattinson in Good Time, we never know if we want them to win or lose. Amidst the frantic pace, there are plenty of jokes and moments of levity. Without giving away too much, there’s a scene where he’s sexting from inside a closet that is laugh out loud funny. While it’s not as tight and tidy as Good Time or Heaven Knows What, adding humor is a big step forward for the Safdie Brothers with Uncut Gems. It’s certainly funnier – largely thanks to Sandler – than anything they’ve done before. It also needs to be to help viewers through the 134 minute runtime. There’s only so long a viewer can take the frenetic pace of a Safdie Brothers film.It’s all so intentionally stressful, but it’s hard to say that having so many characters yelling over each other so frequently always works. There are plenty of times I wanted subtitles or sound mixing to make it clearer what each character was saying. I recognize what the directors were going for, they just need to find that balance.Uncut Gems is everything you’d expect and hope for from the Safdie Brothers. It will get your heart rate going and your adrenaline pumping. Skip your morning coffee and keep a Xanax in your pocket.

"Sep 20, 2019"," Ever since the release of Punch-Drunk Love in 2002 critics and fans alike have been waiting for a director to give Adam Sandler something that showed his immense versatility.  After a recent string of safe Netflix comedies, Sandler finally has a role he can sink his teeth into.  In Uncut Gems, the latest brilliant work from Josh and Benny Safdie (Heaven Knows What), Sandler delivers a tour de force performance in one of the year’s best films. When shady jeweller Howard Ratner (Sandler) finally receives his shipment of a rare stone embedded with colourful gems from Ethiopia, he feels that he has landed the score of a lifetime. Planning to sell it at upcoming auction, he can practically taste his million-dollar payday. Unfortunately, things begin to unravel when NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself) becomes infatuated with the gems while visiting Ratner’s store. Believing that it holds magically powers that will help him in the playoffs, Garnett asks to borrow the item for one night.  However, when Garnett fails to return it at the agreed time Ratner’s life begins to spiral out of control.  Owning several bookies money, Ratner must try to maintain a business as usual demeanour will evading the ruthlessly debt collectors.  If juggling various debts was not stressful enough, Ratner must also navigate his declining marriage to Dinah (Idina Menzel) and his fragile relationship with his mistress/co-worker Julia (Julia Fox), who secretly lives in his apartment downtown. Taking the audience from the mines of Egypt to the frantic and gritty downtown streets to the neon glow of clubs and casinos, Uncut Gems is an exhilarating and unforgettable experience.  Though a sense a mysticism bookends the films, the Safdie brothers do not delve too deeply into the gems’ powers.  Instead, they focus on the dangerous and hilarious chaos that unfolds around it. A masterful dark comedy, the Safdie brothers craft a film that gleefully has one rooting for the bad guy. Ratner is a despicable cheat in more ways than one; but is also someone who the audience cannot help but love. As his various schemes get more complex, the hole Ratner digs himself gets increasingly deeper.   Sandler portrays Ratner’s reckless descent with the perfect blend of arrogance and nervous insecurity.  He is the guy who thinks he has all the angles covered; but is really hanging on by a thread out of sheer luck. Sandler’s performance perfectly fits into the Safdie brother’s natural and edgy style of filmmaking.  The brothers patiently construct a narrative that is a riveting and uncomfortable experiences.  The murkier the waters Ratner swims in, the harder it is for one to look away. A thrilling and darkly funny film, Uncut Gems is a rare treasure indeed. I am intrigued by this though I still haven’t seen anything by the Safdie Brothers though I hope to do so before I see this film.",POSITIVE
"Sep 19, 2019"," No contemporary American filmmakers specialize in bat-out-of-hell propulsion like Josh and Benny Safdie. In their latest film, Uncut Gems, Adam Sandler plays a New York City jeweler whose aggressive speed-walking is like an extension of his racing, insatiable consciousness; his body is trying to keep up with his brain. An apparently self-made magnate, Sandler’s Howard Ratner careens through Manhattan’s diamond district with a cellphone glued to his ear, and cinematographer Darius Khondji keeps pace, tracking laterally through crowded sidewalks and hovering patiently in the rare moments when the character is at rest. Genuine momentum is a rare commodity in filmmaking, and encountering it can be exhausting or exhilarating: a matter of stamina on both sides of the screen. Khondji’s photography is just one weapon in an arsenal of assaultive cinematic technique, along with frenetic editing, a stinging synth score, and Sandler’s hoarse, braying line readings, which leap out of the swirling sound mix. The sheer sensory overload of Uncut Gems is not a surprise as far as the Safdies are concerned—not after relentless efforts like 2014’s dizzying addict drama Heaven Knows What or 2017’s sinister, brilliant Good Time, which was yoked to Robert Pattinson’s squirrelly, nocturnal hustler. The latter is one of the best thrillers of recent years, partly because of how smartly the directors used their star, harnessing just enough of his charisma to give an otherwise repulsive character attractive shadings and then letting him disappear into the role.  With Sandler, such self-effacement simply isn’t possible. No matter how skilled an actor he’s become, he can never truly convince us he’s someone else; think of how directly Funny People drew from his persona. Sandler’s willingness to lend his celebrity to a welterweight contender like Uncut Gems is both to his credit and in his favor, since transformative, under-the-radar acting is easily parlayed into award consideration. Gifted with a true box office draw, the Safdies are at once riding high and in a bind: How can they cultivate their typical street-level realism with an icon riding shotgun? So, with a mix of guts and resourcefulness, the film rips a page out of Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch Drunk Love playbook and leans into certain Sandlerisms—primarily the idea of a loud, abrasive man-child without a behavioral filter—while placing them in a discombobulating new dramatic and artistic context, like Billy Madison remade as Abel Ferrara’s neo-exploitation classic Bad Lieutenant. Ferrara’s 1992 film about a hopelessly corrupt—and yet spiritually yearning—NYPD lifer is an obvious influence on Uncut Gems, which updates both its visionary urban squalor and narrative through line of sports betting gone bad. In Bad Lieutenant, the beleaguered title character keeps placing bets on the NLCS, monitoring the Mets’ progress on his car radio in between busts and spiraling into despair as he hears the home team—which he’s picked to lose—rallying in the late innings. Sandler’s Howard, a family man who cuts a slightly less abject figure than Harvey Keitel’s coke-snorting detective and mostly stays on the right side of the law, is an NBA junkie, and as the film opens, he’s generated a plan to integrate his business interests, his gambling, and his fandom. With the help of a freelance broker (Lakeith Stanfield) whose specialty is infiltrating basketball entourages, he dangles a mysterious, seemingly priceless Ethiopian opal in front of Kevin Garnett—the real Kevin Garnett—and offers to lend it to him for free as a good luck charm before an upcoming playoff game; all he asks as collateral is the Big Ticket’s 2008 championship ring. The excitement of seeing two 21st-century icons acting opposite each other in such a charged metafictional context is real: Watching Sandler and Garnett haggling back and forth in the narrow, glassed-in confines of Howard’s office—a space made all the more claustrophobic by the presence of Garnett’s pals—is funny and bewildering even before the narrative implications of their exchange become clear. One sign of a great thriller is that it contains a moment when you can’t quite believe what you’re seeing, and Uncut Gems gets there in the aftermath of Garnett’s departure, when Howard—his ultimate plan known only to himself—takes the ring and, shockingly, puts it in hock, telling his pawn-shop contact that he’ll buy it back by the end of the week. It’s a wild move—the first of many—and the question of whether Howard is a kind of addled chess master thinking five moves ahead or just a risk-taker with a death wish (one that a number of criminal associates would be all too happy to fulfill) remains open for the duration of the movie like an uncauterized wound. Uncut Gems wouldn’t work if Sandler didn’t pull us into Howard’s compulsions, or if he wasn’t able to work up some sense of sympathy. On one hand, Howard is living the vicarious dream of every beta-male wannabe who dreams of running with alpha dogs; his hilariously tacky, high-tech downtown apartment and young, impressionable mistress (Julia Fox) are decorative signifiers of a revenge-of-the-nerd triumph. But we’re also privy to the swath of destruction he left in his wake, starting with his shattered, former domestic life, the shards of which keep digging in at the most inopportune times—reminders of a different set of responsibilities. The story is set at the intersection of Howard’s separate-but-unequal lives and plays out like a multicar pileup as all parties—including his understandably vengeful, emotionally checked-out wife (Idina Menzel) and various thugs sent by various bookies to collect on various debts—keep running red lights. Howard bears the brunt of these collisions—he’s a punching bag and a crash-test dummy—but remains undaunted; when somebody calls him a “crazy-ass Jew,” it’s taken as an affirmation of a peculiar set of superpowers.  If the smartest movies are ones that know how to conceal their underlying intelligence, Uncut Gems is, like Good Time, deceptively ingenious as a character study. Howard’s lack of tact and carnivalesque transparency make him obnoxious, but he’s also liberated from any sense of pretense about what he wants and what he is; he bargains, borrows, and even steals, but he doesn’t really lie. The Safdies illustrate—in sharp, vivid strokes that sometimes color outside the lines of what audiences may expect from a mainstream movie—how Howard’s behavior exists on a larger continuum of avarice, of which he is by no means the most egregious offender. By setting a story of greed and punishment in the world of high-end jewelry, Uncut Gems drills down to the glittering core of materialism, suggesting it’s as deeply ingrained in the stratas of human character as a stone buried at the bottom of a mine. Even as they prevent the narrative from hurtling off the tracks, the Safdies keep plunging Howard—and the audience—downward, culminating in a final shot that, magically, comes out the other side.  Undoubtedly, Uncut Gems is a New York story: Howard’s Knicks fandom is loudly stated; every extra delivers their dialogue as if they’re auditioning for Midnight Cowboy; and as the clincher, there’s a cameo by the Pope himself, Mike Francesa. There’s a similar sense of civic pride at play in Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, whose protagonists—actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her director-slash-husband Charlie (Adam Driver)—find a metaphor for their crumbling relationship in the movement back and forth between New York and L.A. Location isn’t the only factor in their decision to split, but Nicole’s desire to work closer to the television industry, where she’s scored a role in a high-profile pilot, clashes with Charlie’s off-Broadway ensconcement, as well as his almost parodic devotion to the city’s rhythms. The issue is what—and where—is best for their 8-year-old son, Henry (Azhy Robertson), and an initially amicable conundrum spirals outward and downward into a bruising bicoastal custody battle. Speculation that aspects of Marriage Story are autobiographical to Baumbach’s split with Jennifer Jason Leigh is unavoidable, and yet that’s not what gives the movie its power. Here, instead of cultivating his typical hyperarticulate cruelty, Baumbach’s made a movie that is, in every way, about love—and specifically how it’s only love that can make you truly mean. Love may have been in the mix in dysfunctional showcases like Margot at the Wedding and Greenberg, but only as an abstraction; in the charming Frances Ha, the heightened sweetness was almost satirical. The love in Marriage Story, though, is instantly recognizable and relatable and charged in multiple directions at once: between two parents and the child they adore; between two lovers who don’t like each other anymore.  Structurally, Marriage Story tries to play fair—or have it both ways—by focusing equally on both parties as they lick their wounds, consolidate their assets, and plan their divorce-court strategies. Baumbach’s film is made under the sign of Kramer vs. Kramer, but it’s more magnanimously conceived than that film, which sided with Dustin Hoffman’s struggling single dad. There are shadows of Hoffman’s performance in Driver’s work in Marriage Story, which is his best so far, a marvel of visibly internalized feelings in which every hard swallow can be felt in the back of your own throat.  Charlie’s receipt of a valuable MacArthur Genius Grant establishes his artistic bona fides while mocking his utter haplessness as his life unravels; seated in a posh lawyers’ office tallying up the literal and figurative costs of collapsing his marriage, he doesn’t feel particularly smart. The question of Charlie’s genius and how much bad behavior he’s tried to subsequently justify is one of the places where Marriage Story gets especially thorny, digging with gusto into the myth of the aloof male creative. In an excoriating monologue that is all but begging to be screencapped and meme’d into infinity, Nicole’s cheetah-sleek lawyer (Laura Dern) unleashes on professional and parental double standards in a way that hypothetically demolishes a lot of our sympathy for Charlie—at least until an extended, surreally hilarious set piece involving a court-appointed child “examiner” swings our feelings right back in his direction.  The tonal tug-of-war encoded in Baumbach’s script represents some of his best writing, and the actors—not only Driver and Johansson, but also Dern, and Alan Alda and Ray Liotta as Charlie’s two very different (but equally expensive) legal advisers—tear into their dialogue one withering line at a time. There’s bound to be a lot of discussion of the massive centerpiece argument, which tries to go straight into the emotional-terrorism hall of fame next to John Cassavetes and mostly gets there—the actors go so hard they almost come out of their skin. Yet I was more affected by the movie’s smaller touches, like Nicole’s stage-managed reluctance to serve her husband with divorce papers, or Charlie’s appearance during a Hollywood Hills trick-or-treat trip with Henry as a forlorn, bandage-clad Invisible Man.  More than most of Baumbach’s tightly cloistered comedies, Marriage Story deals with more or less universal emotions, and the fact that they still come through despite the rarefied details of the movie’s showbiz milieu is surprising and gratifying. People are well within their rights to reject this glamorous pantomime of divorce featuring absurdly attractive actors, but what’s the problem if we see parts of ourselves in them? As if to underline this point, Baumbach includes two interludes—one in the middle and one toward the end—in which his characters perform numbers from a beloved, enduring Broadway show whose marital subject matter has of course been carefully chosen yet still seems to belong to them; Charlie and Nicole see themselves in the songs, and since they’re great songs, we do too. That Baumbach uses Stephen Sondheim’s “Being Alive” instead of crafting his own equally ambivalent, affirmative epigram may seem frustrating, but it works because (a) Baumbach’s not alone; and (b) he has good enough taste to be a curator as well as a creator. Either way, what starts out as casual wine-bar karaoke descends into something devastating, before achieving liftoff. It’s a great moment, and Driver, who’s been very good in a lot of movies without ever carrying one in this way, brings the house down.  Three days after its release, how’s the double album landing? And was Swift’s approach to this highly personal project successful? Nora Princiotti and Nathan Hubbard discuss on ‘Every Single Album.’ Nora and Nathan are here to dive into the album and discuss ""Fortnight,"" how Swift is grappling with her level of fame, and much more!",POSITIVE
"Sep 18, 2019"," Editor’s Note: Vanyaland’s Nick Johnston is north of the border all week long for the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival; click here for our continued coverage from the fest and also check out our full TIFF archives of past coverage. If Heaven Knows What or Good Time didn’t cause you to wake up and pay attention to the prodigious talents of Josh and Benny Safdie, their latest work, Uncut Gems, probably won’t grab you either. That’s your fucking loss, however, as it seems the Safdies just get better and better with each subsequent film, and this new one is no exception to that rule.  You see, Howie’s got a bead on a rare uncut black opal, straight from the Ethiopian mines that he’s seen so often on the History Channel, and finally, after months and months of hard work, it arrives at his jewelry shop inside of the guts of a fish (concealed from the prying eyes of TSA agents and customs officers). He’s got grand designs for it, hoping that he can make it big at a priceless gems auction, and he  has reasons to believe that it very well might: It’s valued at over a million dollars, based on its initial estimates. That’ll do him just right: It’ll put him straight with all the bookies and mobsters he owes money to, and potentially get, as RZA once said, “cars for the missus (Idina Menzel) and furs for the mistress (Julia Fox).” But, right as he’s unpacking it, a VIP arrives at his shop: Kevin Garnett (himself) of the Boston Celtics, who sees the gem and demands to look closer at it. In it, Garnett can see the vastness of infinity, and believes that he can channel the opal’s powers against his playoff game against the 76ers that night. So, Garnett asks if he can take it, and in the heat of the moment, Howie says that he can, as long as he leaves his championship ring with him. Sure enough, Garnett whips ass in that game the night, but Howie’s unable to get the opal back.  And from there, Uncut Gems becomes the kind of wacky-yet-straight crime thriller that the Safdies are known for, and it maintains a painful tension throughout each of its 130 minutes as we follow Howie his quest to retrieve his priceless jewel in time for the auction. In doing so, the directors just stack and stack new difficulties for our lead and pull away more and more of his comforts, like a game of bar Jenga where the bricks are covered in razor blades. Their ability to make scenes clear which, if placed in other filmmakers’ hands, would otherwise be incomprehensible, remains unparalleled, and their take on the Altman-esque “talking over each other” sound mixing in stressful scenes is, well, brilliant. Even more striking is their newfound usage of visual effects in several sequences where the cosmic beauty hidden within the gem is fully explored within the frame, and often lead to amusing ends; such as in the film’s opening sequence when the nebulae-like beauty of the microscopic world inside the gem is revealed to actually be a close-up of Sandler’s asshole during a colonoscopy.  It’s a shame that the name above the title will be cause a whole lot of people to look the other way, and I’m pleading with you to forget your biases here, as Sandler is amazing in this film. Look, I know that, outside of the friendly confines of your step dad’s house and the adoring hyper-intellectual audiences of film Twitter, Sandler’s work can often be a hard sell for many people: Just watching the faces of friends fall when I’ve mentioned that Billy Madison led the cast of the best film I saw at TIFF this year has been disheartening. He is incredible here, disappearing deep into Howard’s neuroses and stresses, finding ways to channel the petulant rages that define so many of his comedic characters into something sweaty, swarthy and utterly compelling. He’s an adrenaline junkie, chasing the high of the next con or the bet, and he’s terrible at it, inflicting so much unnecessary pain on his wife and children through his actions. But Sandler’s smile and good attitude is able to, much like in the world of the film, write checks to the audience that they’ll never be able to cash, and he never stops being compelling even at his worst.  Even better, the Safdies have surrounded Sandler with an equally incredible cast, from all walks of New York life — Idina Menzel as his wife, Judd Hirsch as his father-in-law, Lakeith Stanfield as his star-catcher, even Mike Francesca as a street-level bookie who takes Howard’s goofy-ass bets. However, the real diamond in the rough and perhaps the best stunt casting of the year is Garnett, whose utter naturalism and believable obsession with the rock that contains the “stuff that triple-doubles are made of” are a genuine and welcome surprise. If you want an example of acting that’s so realistic that you can hardly believe it as performance, just watch his recreated in-game interview that plays over the film’s ending moments. Even in the perpetual chaos of the moment, of which the Safdies are masters of maintaining, he often dominates sections of the film that you might not expect. Each has their own wild role to play in the moment, providing a new stressor on film’s heart, making the cardiac arrest to come feel just that much more adrenaline-soaked and bizarre.  But Garnett’s casting has, weirdly enough, led me to think about just how many qualities Uncut Gems shares with your average Sandler film, and how totally undeserved that condescension is from sections of the film world, as evidenced above. Everyone from Dan Patrick to Shaq has cameoed in his projects, so it makes sense that Francesca and Garnett would appear here; he’s playing essentially a straight version of his slapstick character, only with crafted with an understated pathos instead of maudlin emotional string-pulling like in Click or Blended; and the wide ensemble buffeting and enhancing every move that Sandler makes. It’s even structured like one of his other projects with everything building to an adrenaline-pumping climax that depends on the outcome of a competition. In a way, it shows that there’s nothing wrong with that formula in the slightest, and if its proper application with the necessary care and sensitivity can result in some truly brilliant art. Uncut Gems is yet another astonishing display of Sandler’s range and the Safdies’ skills, and it’s right up there with A Hidden Life among the best films of this year’s TIFF. ",POSITIVE

"Sep 17, 2019"," Nearly 500,000 film lovers flocked to the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, screening hundreds of films from all over the world. Artistry and diversity, the hallmarks of TIFF, were on view. Black artists, filmmakers and films were a key part of the mix. Big budget movies, small indie films, documentaries and shorts filled out the innovative programming. Check out the best of the best and the most noteworthy.  Atlantics (***) An ill-fated romance in Senegal takes center stage in this visually stunning ode to passion and yearning. French actress-turned-filmmaker Mati Diop won the Cannes’ Grand Prix for co-writing this love triangle between a young woman (Mama Sané), an out-of-work construction worker (Ibrahima Traoré) she loves, and a wealthy fiancé (Babacar Sylla) she disdains. With Claire Mathon behind the camera, Dakar looks picturesque and the composition of each scene is as perfect as the lighting. Diop tells her story using lots of imagery and long scenes that test patience. The beautiful cast looks like they stepped out of Essence Magazine. Themes of class divide, spirits from beyond and girlfriends who like to party often crowd what could have been a simple love story. Still, the romance in this film prevails.  Clemency (***) The debate over the death penalty gets a new spark with this very personal look at a humanistic warden (Alfre Woodard) who makes end-of-life experiences as compassionate as possible for those on death row. It’s as if Warden Bernadine Williams goes on cruise-control as she and her staff strap in inmates for that lethal injection. She thinks she’s fully prepared for everything. Then there’s an inevitable catastrophe that magnifies the toll her job takes on her psyche, husband (Wendell Pierce) and sobriety. Writer/director Chinonye Chukwu’s message is that executing criminals is inhumane. Slow steady drama builds and builds. Woodard creates a protagonist who is equally likeable and unapproachable. Her steely performance is complemented by supporting cast members: Aldis Hodge as the cop-killer next in line for death; Richard Schiff as the convict’s hopeful lawyer; Danielle Brooks as a person from the prisoner’s past.  Dolemite Is My Name (****) When you need encouragement, comedian Rudy Ray Moore (Eddie Murphy) commands, “Put your weight on it.” It’s a mantra he takes to heart as he shifts his talent from struggling comic and spoken-word pioneer to novice DIY indie filmmaker. Moore’s alter-ego is Dolemite, a feisty, martial-arts-loving character he pushes to the front of his first movie. Under the guidance of director Craig Brewer (Hustle & Flow), with a hilarious bio/script by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Eddie Murphy makes a splashing film comeback as the outrageously bold and determined artist who became an integral part of the 1970s Blaxploitation era. Never one to take no for an answer, the brash Moore gives Murphy a great opportunity to work his comic genius. And he does, along with a hilarious dream team who milks laughs: Keegan-Michael Key, Craig Robinson, Tituss Burgess, Wesley Snipes, Mike Epps, and the shameless scene stealer Luenell (I Got the Hook Up 2). Add in cameos by T.I. and Snoop Dogg and a plotline that leads to euphoria and this bit of hilarity becomes an amazing crowd-pleaser and an inspiring movie.  Harriet (***) The responsibility for getting Harriet Tubman’s legacy as an abolitionist and the history of the Underground Railroad told right is a weight few filmmakers could carry. Director Kasi Lemmons (Eve’s Bayou) is up to the task and has a vision. Her efforts are helped by Terence Blanchard’s emotionally charged musical score, John Toll’s evocative cinematography (he makes everyone’s complexion incandescent) and Paul Tazewell’s costumes. The script, by Lemmons and Gregory Allen Howard, pulls the characters into one epic tale of inhumanity, humanity and legendary acts of bravery. Cynthia Erivo (Tony winner The Color Purple; film Widows) plays “Minty” (Tubman’s nickname) with conviction. The evildoers (Joe Alwyn, Jennifer Nettles) and saviors (Leslie Odom Jr., Janelle Monáe) are perfectly portrayed. Lemmons can be heavy on the flashbacks (black and white clips of a family breakup seem redundant), and the footage looks like a cross between an art/indie film and a Lifetime network movie. But overall, she has accomplished a difficult mission that brings the life of an extraordinary liberator into full view. Finally the film medium has produced a public record of Harriet Tubman’s heroism. Now it’s time for Tubman’s image to be on the $20 bill. Waves (**1/2) Filmmaker Trey Edward Shults made an impressive directorial debut with the ultra-realistic family drama Krisha. This return to familial themes focuses on a wealthy black household. A dad (Sterling K. Brown) and stepmom (Renée Elise Goldsberry)–helicopter parents–pressure their teenage son (Kelvin Harrison Jr, Assassination Nation), a high-school wrestling champion, to succeed. He, however, is clandestinely living large, beset with injuries and having major girlfriend problems. His younger sister (Taylor Russel) waits in the wings for the attention she deserves. Shults’ script and direction jump-start start this teen saga with a kinetic verve reminiscent of filmmaker Harmony Korine’s wild and debauched Spring Breakers. Quick, flashy MTV-like edits (editors Isaac Hagy and Shults), a heavy-bass musical score (Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and an envious playlist of hip artists set the tone. The look of the film is perfect: production design by Elliott Hostetter; set decoration by Adam Willis; cinematography by Drew Daniels; and costume design by Rachel Dainer-Best. The plotline in Acts I and II leads to a clichéd stereotypical interpretation of a young black man’s life, which would be suspect coming from a black filmmaker, and is almost insulting coming from a white one. Act III takes the film in a completely different direction, which is fraught with heavy emotion that doesn’t always ring true. Something like TV’s overly touchy-feely This Is Us. In fact, watching Sterling K. Brown shed tears on screen, like he does incessantly on the TV show, is like watching a rainstorm on a tropical island. It’s an event, but it’s no surprise. The Goldfinch (*1/2) The novel of the same name by author Donna Tartt won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. This weakly developed screen adaptation will likely win a Razzie. Can’t blame the premise: A kid, Theo (Oakes Fegley), and his mom enter the Metropolitan Museum of Art. A bomb ignites. She dies. He is taken in by a friend’s wealthy mother (Nicole Kidman). Theo’s worthless father (Luke Wilson) wrestles him away, eyeing the kid’s money. A missing painting of a goldfinch—worth millions—is lost in the explosion. Who has it? Years later Theo (Ansel Elgort) can’t shake his tragic past. Director John Crowley endeared himself to audiences with his sweet, simple period film Brooklyn. In this muddled and overly complicated interpretation of the book (Peter Straughan screenwriter), a series of preposterous circumstances and an overabundance of characters stymies any plausibility. Fegley’s performance fails to make a lasting impression. The photogenic Elgort is handcuffed by a poorly written character. Veteran actor Jeffrey Wright gives the only spot-on performance, but even he can’t save a silly storyline from itself. And why cast a Canadian actor (Finn Wolfhard) and a Welsh actor (Aneurin Barnard) in a pivotal role as Theo’s “Russian” friend Boris (young and old) if they can’t master the accent? Tech credits are solid. Little else is.  Honey Boy (**) His public meltdowns were documented in the news. And now, it’s as if actor/writer Shia LaBeouf wants the masses to know that his erratic behavior is the result of an irregular childhood. Otis (Noah Jupe as the 12-year-old; Lucas Hedges at the 22-year-old), is a child actor being bullied by his ill-tempered father (LaBeouf). Life ain’t easy. Though first-time feature filmmaker Alma Ha’rel directs what’s on the page pretty well, the story, lead characters and their conflicts never gel. LaBeouf lays the bad dad persona on thick, making him appear cartoonish. Bryon Bowers (TV’s “The Chi)” plays an AA friend. Musical artist FKA Twigs portrays a neighbor in a rundown motel. Cast also includes veteran actors Clifton Collins Jr. and Laura San Giacomo. Well-intentioned project. Iffy results at best.  Hustlers (***) A group of industrious strippers bilk Wall Street men out of thousands of dollars during the money-raining days leading up to the great recession. Writer/director Lorene Scafaria (The Meddler) bases her script on a New York Magazine article that chronicles the con games run by Samantha Barbash, a scheming hostess at New York’s strip club Scores. The women swipe credit cards, charge up clothes, buy houses and set up an enterprise that is quite profitable. Sets (production design by Jane Musky), costumes (Mitchell Travers) and cinematography (Todd Banhazi) provide plenty of eye-candy. The pacing (editor Kayla Emter) is tight too. Your eyeballs will pop out of your head when 50-year-old J. Lo, as ringleader Ramona, shimmies down a stripper pole displaying the abs of a twentysomething. As she leads her robber posse on an excursion filled with peril, joy, riches and life lessons, you will be thoroughly entertained. Constance Wu, Mette Towley, Keke Palmer, Lili Reinhart and a cameo by ex-stripper Cardi B add magic as the women go from self-help, to self-employment, to self-infliction. Enjoy, and don’t forget to tip! Knives Out (**) Who did it in this whodunit? And, who cares? Writer/director Rian Johnson (Star Wars: The Last Jedi) tries his hand at mystery writing, to little avail, and he must be an ardent Agatha Christee (Murder on the Orient Express) fan. A wealthy, elderly novelist (Christopher Plummer) dies. Suicide? Homicide? A southern sleuth (Daniel Craig) investigates. Johnson’s script is dull until the reading of the will, when family members’ greed and rivalries rage. The ensemble cast is impressive: Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Lakeith Stanfield as Lieutenant Elliott. There are plot twists aplenty, but none add up to much. Craig’s Alabama accent is atrocious. Does Johnson get anything right? The novelist’s grandson (Evans) drives a sleek 1960/70s silver BMW that is a work of art.  The Report (****) Tracking down the truth regarding the CIA’s Detention and Interrogation Program and the department’s use of torture is a sobering task for Senate staffer Daniel J. Jones, (Adam Driver). Yet, under the guidance of his boss Senator Dianne Feinstein (Annette Bening), he perseveres. Years of Jones’ research unearth wrongdoing, cover-ups and lies that may never come to light. Writer/director Scott Z. Burns (The Informant!) slowly turns a very wonky, fact-based political story into a thrilling drama that pits reality against deceit and the Senate versus the United States Intelligence Community. It’s a battle of wills. Driver’s very intense performances holds viewer’s attention as a barrage of facts, figures and names rain on them in a way that only CNN could decipher. What will stay with audiences forever is that a few people fought to have the CIA’s machinations exposed. An exceptional cast also includes: Jon Hamm, Corey Stoll, Evander Duck Jr., Maura Tierney and Linda Powell (House of Cards). Uncut Gems (****) “They say you can see the whole universe in an opal.” That makes perfect sense to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a gregarious, Jewish NYC jeweler who is deep in debt to the wrong kind of people and hoping his next scheme will get him out of trouble. This time, his plan includes selling a massive opal—the size of a baseball. Brothers Benny and Josh Safdie (Good Time), New York City-based writer/directors, have an urban, guerilla style of filmmaking that mirrors Martin Scorsese’s early works. Now, with a big budget in hand, they get to use all the crayons in the box. Sandler strips away his sunny facade and plays an addicted gambler who chums it up with hip black clients (basketball player Kevin Garnett), holds it down at home with his wife (Idina Menzel), and juggles a hush-hush life with a secret lover (Julia Fox). Player! The film aptly captures the mayhem and noisy din of the Diamond District. Rarely do movies chronicle any synergy between Blacks and Jews who are both living on the same edge. Brilliant filmmaking. Sandler deserves an Oscar nod and an apology from past naysayers. Every dog has its day. Bad Education (****) Thou shalt not steal. It’s a commandment that the characters in this true-life tale of debauchery and excess don’t heed. All is going well in Long Island’s Roslyn School District, until a high school newspaper journalist (Geraldine Viswanathan) starts investigating line items on the school district budget that seem, well, fake. Contractors and companies are ghosts. Certainly Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney), who handles the budgets doesn’t see anything wrong. Nor does the easy-going school district superintendent (Hugh Jackman). As the undeterred student continues to dig, the improprieties mount. The plotline (screenwriter Mike Makowsky) unravels in bits and pieces, causing increasing astonishment. Jackman is as wicked as he can be. Janney as the lady with more relatives on the payroll than Trumps in the White House, plays her sociopathic character to a T. Director Cory Finley (Thoroughbreds) doesn’t point fingers, doesn’t pass judgement. Instead he weaves extramarital affairs, weak school boards and betrayals into a web of insanity that is as outrageous as Janney’s other mayhem vehicle, “I, Tonya.” What’s the alternate spelling of embezzlement? P-R-I-S-O-N.  A total delight in the most devious way.  Blackbird (***) People deal with their last moments on earth in their own ways. Few, however, decide to throw a weekend party so family members can watch them commit suicide. That’s the premise of director Roger Michell’s (Notting Hill, My Cousin Rachel) warmhearted look at a clan who wrestles with cancer, mortality and conflict. Christian Torpe’s screenplay creates viable characters and sets their actions and reactions in motion. Mom (Susan Sarandon) is the weed-smoking matriarch, dad (Sam Neill) her life partner. Two daughters (Kate Winslet, Mia Wasikowaska) show up with their extended families along with mom’s best friend Liz (Lindsay Duncan). Jealousies, rivalries and inner turmoil brim to the surface as they confront mortality: ‘You’re here now. But tomorrow you’ll be dead,” says one daughter. Some moviegoers may wish the family was more down to earth blue-collar than whiny and rich. The wonderful ensemble acting comes under the guidance of Michell. Poignant life-affirming words by Torpe’s perceptive script endure: “The day’s go by so slowly. The years go by so fast.” Considering the gravity of the subject matter, what’s on view is surprisingly touching and disarming in the best ways. Coming Home Again (***) The bond between a mother and her son is tested in this warm-hearted story about a young Korean American man (Justin Chon, Gook) who leaves his job and girlfriend behind to take care of his terminally ill mom (Jackie Chung, Grey’s Anatomy) in San Francisco. They connect through food and the recipes she passes on to him. Based on his own experience, director/writer Wayne Wang (Joy Luck Club) creates a very humbling and humanizing story in a low-budget, small-cast movie that is powerful. Chon’s sensitive acting plays well against Chung’s spirited portrayal. Their experience and culture are specifically Asian, but the lifecycle event is universal. Wayne’s illuminating script and restrained direction give a sense of authenticity and clarity to everything. When the camera focuses on Chon trying to putty up a crack in an old wall, it becomes a metaphor for the film’s very rich and gripping premise.  A Hidden Life (****) In this age of neo-fascism, writer/director Terence Malick (Days of Heaven) astutely reminds viewers that they can counteract evil in their own way. Austrian farmer Franz Jägerstätter (August Diehl) ) becomes a conscientious objector during World War II. His neighbors and town officials in his small village ostracize him, his wife Franziska (Valeri Pachner) and their three young daughters. The Nazis have a plan for him, and its bleak. Malick sets the location perfectly with wondrous shots of the Alps. Scenes of Hitler’s brutal officers committing atrocities reflect the era. The music (James Newton Howard), cinematography (Jôrg Widmer) and production design (Sebastian T. Krawinkel) are exquisite. Eerie parallels to modern times, echo again and again, as vicious leaders pray on the weak and instill fear in the masses. Franz to his spouse: “Oh my wife. What happened to our country, the land we love?” He adds: “If God gives us free will, we’re responsible for what we do.” A masterpiece of storytelling becomes a fitting tribute to those who remain principled and defiant.  Marriage Story (****) As writer/director Noah Baumbach has matured, so has the subject of his films. His 1995 movie Kicking and Screaming reflected his 26-year-old view of life. His 2019 film Marriage Story captures the angst of a 50-year-old who has weathered a divorce. He doesn’t have to say that this story is coming from a very organic place. It’s obvious by the characters on view and the raw emotion they display. Charlie (Adam Driver in his best performance ever) is the head of a Brooklyn theater group. Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) is his wife and the troupe’s star. She’s offered a TV pilot in L.A., and that decision leads the two and their son Henry (Azhy Robertson) on a twisted road through divorce land, which turns them into adversaries with lawyers (Laura Dern for her; Ray Liotta for him.) who bully. There are screaming matches in this marital breakup parable that are as primal as the ones in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” In 136 engaging minutes Baumbach relives every tortured moment and slight in the couple’s less than idyllic marriage. D-I-V-O-R-C-E! The Two Popes (****) It’s surprising to watch a film about two heads of the Catholic Church, who have vehement disagreements and opposing viewpoints yet find common ground. It’s as if Anthony McCarten’s (Darkest Hour) insightful screenplay is trying to teach polarized factions how to bond. Anthony Hopkins plays Pope Benedict, the traditionalist monsignor who is stodgy and not hip to the times. Jonathan Pryce is Pope Francis, a sociable, humble innovator more concerned with the good of the people than the strict rules of the church. The film is strongest when it concentrates on the two actors giving their diametrically opposed opinions. It’s less interesting, but still good, when it depicts Francis’ backstory. Directed deftly by the brilliant Brazilian filmmaker Fernando Meirelles (City of God), the dignity, humanity and humor of the two characters is quite appealing. Francis: “How does an Argentinian kill himself? He climbs to the top of his ego and jumps off.” Jump Popes. Jump.",POSITIVE
"Sep 17, 2019"," by Walter Chaw Enfants terrible Josh and Bennie Safdie follow-up their kinetic crime thriller Good Time with Uncut Gems, another helping of the same packed with so much anxiety and energy that it becomes exhausting a good while before it's done with you. Opening in an Ethiopian opal mine, where a huge-karated black specimen is unearthed in secret by subsistence miners while one of their compatriots wails in agony over a nasty open fracture in his leg, Uncut Gems then cuts to diamond dealer Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) getting a colonoscopy. When not having the inside of his bowels photographed, he's ensconced in his little retail hole in New York's Diamond District, doing his best to fend off an endless wave of creditors while looking for that one big score. In a recent (i.e., February, 2019) article in INTERVIEW, Patrick McGraw memorably describes that stretch of West 47th between 5th and 6th avenues as ""…a composite of fake teeth, cheap cologne, aviators, dyed hair, machismo, self-loathing, and seemingly uncontrollable gesticulating""–a good description of Howard, too, as it happens, as Sandler finally finds a dramatic role the equal now of his finest hour, Punch-Drunk Love. Howard is not unlike Barry, the role he played in P.T. Anderson's film–if Barry had no success managing his sudden fits of manic rage. 
Uncut Gems matches the frantic intensity of Sandler's performance with Daniel Lopatin's driving, experimental score and a restless camera wielded by veteran cinematographer Darius Khondji that acts a little like how a panic attack feels. Viewed a certain way (as a jeweller does a gem, say), the film works as a harsh depiction of how capitalism is a disease of accumulation and excess. Howard has everything: his own business, a long-suffering wife (Adele Dazeem) and two spoiled brats who are disappointed in him, and a stable of semi-loyal employees, including the one who gets him African-American customers (Demany (LaKeith Stanfield)) and the one (Julia (Julia Fox)) he's put up in an apartment in the city and fucks regularly. Demany, doing his job, brings then-Celtics star Kevin Garnett into Howard's store and Howard can't resist showing off his new acquisition: the (we presume) illegally-acquired black opal. Garnett (playing himself in a brilliant turn) falls in love with it and believes it to be a good-luck charm for his playoff series against the Sixers. Howard lets him borrow it, and then everything turns all After Hours on him when he can't quite ever seem to get the opal back again. Howard has everything, but it's never enough. The marvel of Uncut Gems is how long it maintains its series of reversals and surprises. Nothing you expect will happen happens, or at least it seldom happens the way you expect. It's that rarity of a film that believes it's smarter than you and then proves it, reminding in every way that counts of Matteo Garrone's underseen Dogman: a crime movie that's seen enough crime movies. Its portrait of compulsive personalities is extraordinary, aided by Sandler's empathy for Howard's growing frustration. It's easy to trainspot the myriad ways in which the horrors of Howard's life are Howard's fault, but the feeling of being betrayed, humiliated, and disappointed provide broad justification–if only entirely satisfying for Howard–for his actions. Howard isn't exactly likeable, but as with any good noir protagonist in the pressure-cooker, you want things to work out for him anyway. The film doesn't work without Sandler, and in it he finds the perfect vehicle for his unctuous, aggressive, yet somehow still ingratiating persona. I love a moment at a Passover dinner where Howard reads the ritual, listing off the Biblical plagues in English as his grandmother reads them off in Yiddish. In its relative calm, this scene suggests the antithesis of the rest of the film–but running under and through it is our understanding that a half-dozen people want to kill Howard, that he's forgotten a couple of vital errands for his endless scheming to work, that his wife hates him and is leaving him, that he's probably has earned a few more beatings, and that all of these people here who love him (Judd Hirsch is magnificent in a small role as Howard's father) have been hurt by Howard's actions and will be again if they're not careful. Uncut Gems is a layered–multifaceted, let's go ahead and call it–beast that works as any number of things. Even the titular reference to the film's MacGuffin functions on multiple levels as a sly joke about its own episodic structure, about the bris, about potential and the teasing out of it that is Howard's stock in trade. By weaving in a subplot about the cult of professional sports in the United States, the movie becomes an involved conversation, and catalyst for the same, about how money destroys everything. If it's a warning, alas, it comes too late. Uncut Gems is the truth: the story of the world told feral and dangerous. You could be right about everything and still be dead. God is in His heaven. We're all alone down here.",POSITIVE
"Sep 17, 2019"," A few weeks ago, we came to you with a list of the movies we were most excited to see this fall. Since then, GQ's gone to the Toronto International Film Festival, where we had the chance to see some actual contenders. Here are our biggest takeaways. If there’s one movie this year you should go into as cold as possible, it’s Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite. The latest from the Snowpiercer and Okja filmmaker follows two families: the affluent Parks, who live in a luxurious home encased in glass walls, and the Kims, an unemployed clan who fold pizza boxes for money inside a cramped basement apartment. Another wickedly clever tale from the director about class and survival, Parasite is a brilliant tonal juggling act that defies easy genre categorization. It fuses dark satire, suspense, and tragedy with incisive social commentary. It’s an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that keeps you guessing at every sharp turn, and by the end, leaves you a bit paralyzed by its magnificence. Simply calling the hit movie Hustlers the female Magic Mike or a gender-swapped Scorsese gangster pic would be wildly dismissive. Lorene Scafaria’s film may be another New York crime tale—based on the true story of a group of exotic dancers and sex workers who conned Wall Street men for mind-boggling amounts of money—but what makes Hustlers such a dynamic standout is the way in which women, their perspectives, and stories are valued and centered. Hustlers follows strip club newcomer Destiny (an excellent Constance Wu) and club veteran Ramona (Jennifer Lopez in an incredible and, yes, Oscar-worthy turn) as they devise an outrageously risky and illegal plan to make a living after the clubs run dry following the 2008 recession. Scafaria’s film is at once smart and energized, told with visual panache and a rousing story about women—particularly low-income women of color—going to any lengths necessary to survive. It’s a miracle anyone could find a way to breathe invigorating life into the murder mystery film, but thankfully, Rian Johnson is perfect for the job. His Knives Out is a wildly entertaining whodunit with more on its mind than solving a murder. After the patriarch of a wealthy white family, Christopher Plummer’s Harlan Thrombey, is found dead after his 85th birthday, his greedy relatives become embroiled in an investigation led by Lakeith Stanfield’s detective and Daniel Craig’s Southern P.I. The giddy fun of watching Knives Out isn’t in trying to solve the mystery (its twists are expected, and it loses momentum in an overly drawn-out explanation near the end) but in watching an excellent cast continually one-up each other. You'll almost certainly walk away from Knives Out with a favorite performance, whether Toni Collette’s riotous parody of a lifestyle guru to Chris Evans as the family black sheep dirtbag or the movie's real breakout, Ana de Armas, (Blade Runner 2049) as Harlan’s caretaker. Pedro Almodóvar’s latest is a tender reflection on how the searing wounds of our past can both stifle us and shape who we are. Reuniting with his longtime collaborator, Antonio Banderas is better than ever as Salvador Mallo, an aging, lonely film director who serves as Almodóvar's onscreen stand-in. Salvo is anchored by memories of his past, like sweet moments with his mother (a warm Penélope Cruz) and his first experience desiring another man, while also hindered by the physical ailments that prevent him from making new films. Emotional and sensitive, Pain and Glory works like an intimate embrace, one that stings and soothes all at once. In the latest from Logan director James Mangold, Matt Damon plays car designer Carol Shelby who’s recruited by the Ford Motor Company to help them beat the Italians at the 1966 24 Hours of Le Mans race. He puts the best driver he knows behind the wheel, a charmingly smug Ken Miles (Christian Bale). That quickly proves problematic when the Ford execs reject the capricious Miles as incompatible with the company’s image. The behind-the-scenes automotive drama can swerve formulaic at times, but Ford v Ferrari really soars when we get to the track. Mangold crafts a series of enthralling, stylized racing sequences that form the pulse of the movie and will suck you in even if you, like me, don’t know the slightest thing about cars or racing. Since his 2011 Palme d’Or-winning The Tree of Life, Terrence Malick has been making the most experimental, and most critically derided, films of his career—though this critic will gladly defend some of those. The latest from the reclusive filmmaker marks a return to his (somewhat) more narrative-based style. A Hidden Life, easily Malick’s most accessible film in years, tells the true story of Franz Jägerstätter (August Dihel), an Austrian conscientious objector who refused to fight for Hitler. Malick’s signature lyrical style of floating wide-angle shots set to ponderous voiceover is still present as Franz and his wife (a standout performance from Valier Pachner) contemplate moral quandaries around injustice, suffering, and the roles of man and God in each. A Hidden Life may not be as soul-stirring as his best and most profound work, but it’s always a treat to see Malick confidently working in his meditative and spiritually transportive groove. There’s a very defined, quietly consuming electricity that grows between two people longing for one another, especially in queer courtship. That burning desire can turn subtle glances into butterflies and fireworks; it morphs tiny gestures and flirtatious smiles into a secret language. That tender, aching intimacy is what patiently brews between two women in 18th Century France in Céline Sciamma’s masterful Portrait of a Lady On Fire. The latest from the French filmmaker (Girlhood, Tomboy) follows artist Marienne (Noémie Merlant) who’s been commissioned to paint a portrait of the reserved and soon-to-be-wed Héloïse (Adèle Haenel). An exquisite slow-burn romance about queer desire and the ways passion transforms artistic expression, Portrait is the type of film you fall swiftly in love with, and like the memory of an old lover, stays with you long after. Robert Eggers’s follow-up to The Witch is an enchanting, grimy descent into pure madness. When two lighthouse keepers, Robert Pattinson’s taciturn Ephraim and Willem Dafoe’s grouchy, gaseous Thomas, arrive on an island for four weeks of work, unnerving visions and maniacal, drunken episodes take over. This delightfully nutty tale, full of fights with seagulls and copious farting, is as wickedly funny as it is blissfully horny — prepare for more Pattinson masturbation and an undeniable erotic tension between the two leads. Shot on 35mm black and white by Jarin Blaschke in a 1.19:1 aspect ratio, The Lighthouse is a startling thing to behold, as transfixing as a vision of a glistening mermaid on a wave-beaten rock. Like the tentacles of the Kraken, The Lighthouse slowly snakes its way through your mind, gripping tighter until you relinquish all expectations and succumb to the strange, haunting glory of this wild ride. A Safdie Brothers movie isn’t a Safdie Brothers movie if it doesn’t stress you the hell out, and Uncut Gems does just that. Benny and Josh Safdie’s long-in-the-works Diamond District film is another one of their quintessential New York movies, full of seedy characters caught up in anxiety-inducing situations within the grimy streets of Manhattan. Adam Sandler, in another impressive dramatic role that plays off of his signature angry outbursts, is Howard Ratner, a scheming jeweler drowning in gambling debt who’s incapable of making anything but terrible decisions. Uncut Gems, like Good Time, takes us down a dark path of chaos as Howard evades debt collectors and gets wrapped up in a predicament with NBA star Kevin Garnett (playing himself in a scene-stealing role), yet the film doesn’t have quite the same starling punch and propulsive adrenaline of that Robert Pattinson-led film. Still, the Safdie’s latest is a wild crime thriller that will have you laughing and gasping in horror from one moment to the next.",POSITIVE
"Sep 17, 2019"," When jewelry store owner Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) finds himself with Kevin Garnett (playing himself) in his showroom in an early scene of Uncut Gems, he’s understandably eager to impress the basketball star. While examining Howard’s latest acquisition, a block of Ethiopian black opal, the Celtics player leans just a little too heavily on the glass counter below him and it shatters. Howard had warned him earlier about putting his weight against the glass, but it didn’t stop Garnett. In some other circumstances, this gesture might have been innocuous and not ended in destruction, the glass could have withstood the pressure. But these aren’t the circumstances of a Safdie Brothers film. Instead, in the latest film from Josh and Benny Safdie, no matter the opportunity for foresight, applying pressure eventually results in something breaking. This being exemplified doesn’t stop Howard from ignoring the writing on the wall about his own penchant for destructive behavior. Howard makes his money from his store in Manhattan’s diamond district selling jewelry and other merchandise that may or may not have fallen off the back of a truck. In turn, he loses his money gambling and making deals with a range of goons and bookies. Howard’s most recent endeavors have resulted in him owing a considerable amount of money and having to dodge collectors left and right. Rather than cut back on expenses — which include a suburban Long Island house for his wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), and an East Side apartment for his aptly named girlfriend, Jules (Julia Fox) — Howard bets what money he does have on sports. When Garnett takes an interest in Howard’s remarkable opal, believing it to be a talisman for good luck as he enters the NBA playoffs, Howard finds himself on a bewildering and manic odyssey as he is willing to risk it all in order to come out a winner. The world that Howard inhabits is as chaotic as the man himself. The Safdies brilliantly grapple with a number of intersecting narratives while ensuring that Howard as the connective tissue is always foregrounded. The frenetic cinematography courtesy of Darius Khondji — the master DP’s first but hopefully not last collaboration with the Safdies — catapults us into Howard’s perspective. Khondji’s sublime and kinetic camerawork is enthralling, capturing Howard’s energy and throwing us into the deep end of his environment as we try to keep up with his rapid pace. It’s an assaultive experience that doesn’t allow anyone time to catch their breath. Watching the film feels like being punched in the face in order to feel alive. If stress could be converted to energy, Uncut Gems audiences could power a small city. One of the most remarkable aspects of this electrifying film is how lived-in it feels. Featuring Garnett and The Weeknd playing versions of themselves, and with a story revolving around real games in the NBA playoffs, the world of Uncut Gems is one we can recognize, even if it’s a heightened version of our own. The details of Howard’s life are presented with a specific and singular sense of realism the Safdies have mastered: no matter how over-the-top the story may be, the messiness of its main character is so human that it grounds the film. Credit here must go to Sandler’s magnificent performance as the film’s anti-hero. This is arguably the best performance of his career, one that is sure to garner him an Oscar nomination and would make for a deserving win. It’s difficult to imagine there’s another actor working right now who would have been so adept at capturing Howard’s ridiculous qualities while garnering a sense of affection. He’s oafish and loud, both in his squawking voice and gauche fashion sense. But he’s so genuinely committed to his aims and so out of his depth that to hate Howard would feel like kicking a man when he’s down — an especially bad feeling when the man in question doesn’t even realize he’s down. But no matter how much Howard’s messiness may be endearingly human, the Safdies are firmly unwilling to sanction his entitlement. Uncut Gems opens on an Ethiopian mine that reveals the opal’s origin. It’s an area rife with conflict and bloodshed as even the workers that are dealing with Howard are risking their lives for a fraction of what the opal is worth. As with Good Time, the directors are keenly aware of how their narrative examines themes of privilege. Without being preachy or flattening their story to serve a single interpretation, they do wisely allow other characters time to address Howard’s greed. He might ultimately ignore the critiques, but the film certainly doesn’t. Running through all of this is the film’s hypnotic score. Composed by Daniel Lopatin, AKA Oneohtrix Point Never, the pulsating synth melodies are bewitching in their own right and imbue the film with an almost otherworldly quality. As grounded as the film is in its raw, anxious world, there’s a feeling of mysticism around the opal that is transcendent. It’s as though it truly can be anything to anyone: a talisman capable of blessing or cursing he who holds it, or simply a rock brought into human possession through violence and greed. A mythic gem or a MacGuffin? No one can really say. The film is labyrinthian and utterly beguiling. Just as Howard is drawn to gambling like a moth to a flame, Uncut Gems is a whirlwind of emotional highs and lows that you can’t help but become obsessed with. At one point, another character asks Howard if he’s having a good time as he scrambles about frantically. It’s said in an incredulous tone, from someone unable to comprehend how a man can still function amid the chaos he has wrought. Indeed, it’s baffling to the point of almost being impressive that Howard is capable of one-upping himself and finding new ways to indulge in his destructive and competitive impulses. It’s a rhetorical question, but Howard — a man so painfully human, so incapable of recognizing that he’s doing his own version of leaning on the glass, so blinded by the light of his gems that he can’t see how his world is on the verge of shattering — sincerely answers it. Is he having a good time? “Yes.” Of course he is.",POSITIVE

"Sep 15, 2019"," The Safdie brothers (GOOD TIMES, HEAVEN KNOWS WHAT) return to TIFF this year with UNCUT GEMS, starring Adam Sandler and several bizarre cameos (including John Amos).  The film begins in Ethiopia in 2010.  A group of miners find deposits containing black opal.  The buyer, Howard Ratner (Sandler) is a collector and jewelry store proprietor in New York. The gems arrive uncut, in stone, smuggled in an icebox of fish.  He believes the opals are, collectively, worth over $1 million and plans to sell them at auction to pay off a number of loan sharks to whom he owes money.   Well-known among the many celebrities who come through Manhattan, Kevin Garnett pays a visit looking for something new to buy.  Foolishly, with no intent to sell the opal-encrusted stone, he shows it to Garnett who immediately decides he must have it.  Despite Howard’s refusal, Garnett takes the stone in exchange for his NBA Championship ring as collateral. I often wonder how people so repeatedly bumble their way through life without it ever catching up to them.  Howard’s wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), knows about his mistress, Julia (Julia Fox), on whom he lavishes gifts paid for, no doubt, by money he doesn’t have, owed to loan sharks, Arno (Eric Bogosian) and Phil (Keith Williams Richards) who are into him for six figures plus 17% interest, because he has a gambling habit he can’t shake. The Safdie brothers’ formula for tension amounts to visual and auditory cacophony.  Overlapping dialogues, city sounds, and a score by Daniel Lopatin that riffs a little too overtly off Vangelis’ early-1970’s studio work, overwhelm the senses.  Craftier direction could maintain the separation between viewer and subject while still conveying the sense of agitation omnisciently, without dragging us through the depths of Howard’s self-dealt miseries. While Adam Sandler’s performance as Ratner is commendable, he spends much of the movie swearing, seething, screaming, and descending occasionally times into comedy to the point of provoking audience laughter.  Sandler’s attempt to convey the character’s guilt falls on deaf ears—either because it’s so unbelievable about the character, or because Sandler isn’t convincing.  I guess there’s more than one flavor of annoyingly histrionic, incompetent bumbler? If I told you this film didn’t have a happy ending, you wouldn’t be surprised at all.  Getting away with it would make moviegoers irate about the two hours of their life they’ll never get back—certainly not with interest.",NEGATIVE
"Sep 14, 2019"," TORONTO – Adam Sandler has turned in a fair share of cringe-worthy characters over his 30-year career. His performance in UNCUT GEMS, however, is a diamond in the rough. In Josh and Benny Safdie’s follow-up to their excellent dirty New York crime-comedy GOOD TIME, the sibling directors steer Sandler toward a commanding use of his energy.  Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a diamond dealer with a jet black goatee and a getup that’s decked out head to toe in Gucci. Howard is a hustler at heart, moving and shaking from one scam to the next in his claustrophobic jewelry shop. Their brand of balmy New York is jittery, depraved, and drives you to the point of delirium, which is bound to disorient the audience. If so, that’s only a side effect to the kinetic energy that Safdie’s can wield.  Howard’s world is an exhausting place to enter. He’s abrasive and always multitasking on three things at once. It’s as if the Safdie’s are speeding through his succession of movements in rapid-fire practice. He’s got a swath of people cramped in his tiny office space that is defended by bulletproof glass and a magnetic door that sticks. It’s the only sense of control Howard has in his life, and he can’t figure out how to manage even the simplest tasks who chaos erupting. Everything about his surroundings makes sense for this character. Howard has got a certain lust for life – the more, the better. He has a house he shares with his wife (Idina Menzel), who hates his guts. So, he stays with his girlfriend (Julia Fox), who works for him in an apartment he bought for their rendezvous. Howard dodges calls from bookies, gangsters, and from his brother-in-law, Arno (Eric Bogosian), who comes through from time to time with his cronies, whom Howard never takes seriously. He’s involved in a vicious cycle that he really has no idea how to escape from. It’s a mad dash through the film’s first 30 minutes, which set the stage for this man’s head-spinning routine. Once the film has established its rhythm, the plotting takes off through an odyssey that introduces celebrities, criminals, and several distinct faces. In 2012, Howard’s path crossed with Boston Celtic’s Kevin Garnett after a broker (LaKeith Stanfield) brought him to the diamond shop to buy a fugazi Rolex watch. Powerless against the urge to brag in front of a professional athlete, he brings out an Ethiopian opal stone filled with the titular uncut gems. Kevin feels a calling towards the stone, and he offers Howard close to a quarter of a million bucks believing that it will bring him good luck during a playoff series game. Through the swaying camera work of Darius Khondji (SEVEN), the New York is photographed like it’s suffocating. There’s barely any room for the characters to move. It’s stressful but intentional, no doubt. Sander’s costumes are just so perfect, personifying the faux-glamour lifestyle. Howard likes the idea of being a jeweler to the socially elite, but hocking diamonds is far too stimulating. The Safdie’s have proven themselves as visionary collaborators. UNCUT GEMS is an incredible descent into an unsettling state of mind. Filled with bad decisions to enhance audience engagement, the film makes Howard another classic Safdie character who thrives on making one self-sabotaging decision after the other. It’s an absolute train wreck watch, and it’s a career-best for Sandler.  UNCUT GEMS screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. Encore screenings will be held on September 14 and 15. Visit tiff.net for more information. A24 will release the film on December 25.",POSITIVE
"Sep 13, 2019","With the new movie from the Safdie brothers, Adam Sandler reminds us once again that he's not a bad actor. He's only done some really bad movies. [Full review in Spanish]",POSITIVE
"Sep 13, 2019"," PLOT:  Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a slippery, unscrupulous jeweler with an out-of-control gambling addiction, who pins his hopes in an Ethiopian opal that he hopes will get him out of the hole is dug himself into – if he can stay out of his own way. REVIEW:  Of all the actors emerging out of TIFF this year with Oscar buzz, perhaps the most surprising is Adam Sandler. No one could have predicted that sandwiched between his Netflix comedies, he’d opt to do a frenetic indie crime thriller that’s so far outside of what we’d expect from him. Previous dramatic vehicles, including PUNCH DRUNK LOVE, FUNNY PEOPLE and THE MEYEROWITZ STORIES were less of a stretch than what he does here, but he carries the film so well you wonder why no one’s thought to cast him in something like this sooner. In a lot of ways, UNCUT GEMS feels like the kind of role guys like Al Pacino or Robert De Niro would have played twenty years ago, with the connection to that kind of filmmaking furthered by the fact that Martin Scorsese is on-board as a producer. It’s a wild ride that grabs you right from the start and doesn’t let go until the end credits, jacked up by so much frantic energy you’d swear you’re watching the cinematic version of cocaine. It’s a tough part for anyone to pull off, but Sandler nails it by going all-in on making his Howard Ratner utterly repulsive in some ways, but oddly charismatic in others. We can’t help but root for him even as he flushes himself further and further down the drain, by dodging loan sharks and doubling down on self-destructive bets any time he gets the least bit ahead. It’s the most effective film made about gambling since probably the original 1974 version of THE GAMBLER, and Sandler’s jittery energy is so expertly conveyed you honestly could never imagine anyone else playing the role. It’s also a great New York movie, capturing the chaotic, overwhelming energy of the city in a way similar to the Safdie Bros’s previous film, GOOD TIME. Propulsion is the film’s key, being driven along by the frantic pace (which makes this feel remarkably short for a 130-minute movie) and an awesome score by Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never. The Safdies make an interesting choice by setting this in 2012, building the film around a series of basketball games played by NBA superstar Kevin Garnett, who plays himself in a surprisingly juicy supporting role, with him being obsessed with the Opal Ratner brings in from Africa. Lakeith Stanfield plays Howard’s connection with the NBA, while Judd Hirsch and Eric Bogosian add New York flavor as guys in Sandler’s orbit, not all of them with his best interests at heart. Idina Menzel has a small part as Sandler’s wife, while newcomer Julia Fox plays his sexy mistress – who has a big scene with The Weeknd, also playing himself (complete with his iconic circa 2012 hairstyle) in a surprisingly self-lacerating way. Like GOOD TIME, UNCUT GEMS feels like the work of totally uncompromising artists, with crazy shifts in tone, ranging from near slapstick comedy to brutal explosions of violence, that add to the chaos. It shouldn’t work – but it does and brilliantly. This is another kickass piece of work from A24, who further their reputation as the coolest studio in the biz, and utterly revitalizes Sandler’s career – who I hope pursues more roles like this. Chris Bumbray began his career with JoBlo as the resident film critic (and James Bond expert) way back in 2007, and he has stuck around ever since, being named editor-in-chief in 2021. A voting member of the CCA and a Rotten Tomatoes-approved critic, you can also catch Chris discussing pop culture regularly on CTV News Channel. ",POSITIVE
"Sep 13, 2019"," If you’re looking for cinematic tour guides to the road to ruin, you can’t do much better than Josh and Benny Safdie. The New York-based indie filmmaker brothers are masters of a certain type of adrenalized, immersive storytelling that puts us up close with characters whose default mode is desperation. Two years ago, they rocked Cannes with the heist-gone-wrong thriller “Good Time,” starring a mesmerizing Robert Pattinson. And this year, they’re back with “Uncut Gems,” a blast-furnace character study starring Adam Sandler as a New York jewelry salesman with an unerring instinct for finding a way to screw up everything he touches. After a brief prologue set in an Ethiopian mine, “Uncut Gems” delivers the most instructive trick shot imaginable: It opens on a rock containing opals that seem to shimmer with every color of the rainbow, with the camera plunging into the mysterious depths of the opal before emerging back into daylight via the intestines of Sandler’s character, who’s undergoing a colonoscopy. In other words: Here’s a movie in which the promise of rare beauty and unimaginable riches will end up all going to … well, you know. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a perpetually panicked businessman who owns a store in Manhattan’s diamond district, has a wife who hates him (Idina Menzel) and a girlfriend in a spare apartment who usually likes him (Julia Fox). We think of Howard as a nice guy because he’s got Adam Sandler’s face, but he’s really a mess, perpetually hustling to stay ahead of creditors who aren’t shy about using hired goons to collect. Every time Howard gets the money to pay back one debt, he uses it on high-stakes bets that he thinks will help him pay off others as well. Naturally, this is a recipe for disaster, though it seems likely that Howard could find a way to create chaos around him under absolutely any circumstance. (When he recites the plagues of Egypt as part of a Passover seder, he might as well be describing what he did last weekend.) But that rock of opals that we saw at the beginning of the movie is, Howard thinks, the answer to all his troubles. It’s on its way to him, he’s sure it’s worth $1 million or more, and there’s a tony auction house ready to bring him the big bucks, as long as he can keep from messing everything up. Like Howard, the Safdies also have a knack for creating chaos — but unlike Howard, they’re at their best creating an onscreen atmosphere of chaos and ruin. Between the Robert Altmanesque sound mix with conversations jumbled on top of each other, the camerawork by Darius Khondji that remains jittery even in the quiet moments and the Daniel Lopatin music that uses stately choral passages not to lull but to disrupt, the Safdies are maestros of messiness, and they are absolutely at the peak of their games here. The easy shorthand is that this is a change of pace for Sandler along the lines of his Paul Thomas Anderson film “Punch Drunk Love.” But the actor hasn’t been a one-dimensional funnyman for many years, if he ever really was — his understated performance in “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)” showed that two years ago. “Uncut Gems” turns up the volume several notches from that performance, but it reinforces how good Sandler is at being a hangdog Everyman. His nonstop, unchecked desperation is wholly convincing, intermittently funny and occasionally pretty moving. The rest of the cast clearly gets a kick out of the craziness, too. Lakeith Stanfield is a blur of hyperactive bluster as a guy who brings Howard prospective clients, including basketball superstar Kevin Garnett, while Garnett does a very convincing job of playing a version of himself who happens to be obsessed with the opal during a playoff series. At close to two and a half hours, “Uncut Gems” is a wild and long ride that refuses to let either the characters or the audience relax. But hey, you don’t go to a Safdie Brothers movie to relax — you go to let them take you on a hell of a ride.

"Sep 12, 2019"," It is a good thing that I’ve never been offered the opportunity to interview Adam Sandler – the man would probably slap me in the face. And with good reason. For years, it has been so easy to backhand-compliment the actor as Hollywood’s smartest idiot. The man makes lazily stupid movies, which just so happens to be one of the smartest things you can do in the modern streaming era. Kudos to the actor for recognizing the fact that most of us don’t want to be artistically tested or emotionally engaged on a weeknight, and we would much rather zone out to one of his half-hearted-but-full-farted dumb-dumb Netflix productions such as The Ridiculous 6, The Do-Over, Sandy Wexler or Murder Mystery. It is submental comfort over bare-minimum effort, and it has made Adam Sandler and his many fellow Saturday Night Live veterans fabulously wealthy. (There is a reason that Rob Schneider can afford a Tesla.) Every now and then, though, the Sandman grows up. He trades in his oversized tees and basketball shorts and tossed-off gags and Kevin James cameos for a more mature screen persona and presence. He looks for material and collaborators who challenge his (sincerely) wide range, instead of yes-men who flatter his long-in-the-tooth man-boy shtick. There are false starts and well-meaning misfires and outright bad decisions along the way – James L. Brooks’s Spanglish, Mike Binder’s Reign Over Me, Jason Reitman’s Men, Women & Children – but exactly once every seven years, the world gets to see the other side of Adam Sandler. And it is pretty damn glorious. In 2002, there was Paul Thomas Anderson’s Punch-Drunk Love. In 2009, there was Judd Apatow’s Funny People (yes, I’m serious). And this year, there’s Benny and Josh Safdie’s Uncut Gems. The only difference today is I’m not sure that Sandler can ever go back to his comfortable world of Netflix trash. Uncut Gems proves that Capital-C Cinema needs Capital-A Actor Adam Sandler, and vice versa. A 135-minute anxiety attack disguised as a movie, Uncut Gems is a gritty and unrelenting masterpiece – a thrilling and deeply dirty ode to not only a sub-genre of scum cinema and drippy-filth purveyors that the New York Safdie brothers grew up idolizing (Abel Ferrara and Al Goldstein loom large), but an aggressive tribute to the fuming rage and stunted potential of the Sandman himself. The actor is in nearly every frame of Uncut Gems and slashes the entire feature with a cutting hook: laugh all you want, but this is how I win. Sandler’s avatar here is Howard Ratner, a constantly yelling, permanently stressed-out Manhattan jeweller who is one deal away from either imploding or rocketing off into the New York skyline. Howard scamps and rattles around Manhattan’s Diamond District like an amphetamine-powered rodent, trading favours and spreading lies in order to control and further his twin vices: gambling and hustling, if there is even a difference between the two. Either way, at the opening of the film Howard is deep in debt to his mobbed up brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian), on the outs with both his wife (Idina Menzel) and his mistress (a breakout performance from Julia Fox), and trying to convince various real-life superstars (musician The Weeknd and NBA legend Kevin Garnett play themselves) to buy into one of his many sparkling schemes. For Howard, there is always one more score, one more deal, one more diamond-crusted Furby [yep] to nab out of someone else’s hand. He digs himself further into trouble purely for the manic rush of figuring out a way to escape his own burial. Howard is such an intensely intense character – a despicable degenerate whom we cannot but help root for – that plunking anyone other than Sandler into the role seems unimaginable. The actor brings the totality of his many terrible career decisions and compresses them into a nervy nub of self-loathing energy that is wonderfully hypnotic to behold. The rare moments when Sandler is not onscreen feel acutely, distressingly small, and a panic sets in: where’s Howard? Is Howard okay? When are we going to get to see Howard again? For all the many times I had previously prayed that Adam Sandler would simply go away, now I could simply not stomach his absence. Whatever praise heads toward Sandler should be tripled in the direction of the Safdies. The siblings, who have experience turning mainstream icons into earring-clad scumbags thanks to 2017′s Robert Pattinson-starring Good Time, start big and fast and grimy – after an opening that pays homage to the underground horrors of The Exorcist, the directors dive deep into the under-the-skin horrors of the human body, tracing the inside of Howard’s colon – and do not stop to take a breath for one single vulgar moment. The eye-popping, stomach-churning, nerve-rattling aesthetic that the siblings have concocted and perfected feels similar to a Vice Magazine circa 2012 article come to life, and I mean that as the highest possible compliment. (Added bonus: The film features the most realistic depiction of a Passover Seder ever committed to film. Its Blu-ray should henceforth be as compulsory a contemporary Jewish artifact as the Maxwell House Haggadah.) By the end of Uncut Gems, I was shaken and rattled and absolutely exhausted. I was in the perfect state, then, to plop down on my couch and drift off to one of Sandler’s Netflix writeoffs. But I only wanted to watch Uncut Gems again. I needed to remind myself of how much Adam Sandler can, and should, do. Even if it killed me.",POSITIVE
"Sep 12, 2019"," na dosis de necesaria adrenalina cinematográfica fue proporcionada por los hermanos Josh y Benny Safdie con su nueva y más sólida realización a la fecha, Uncut Gems (Gemas no cortadas). Sobre un guion de ellos mismos y Ronald Bronstein, la narrativa se centra en el joyero transa Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) y sus arriesgadas maniobras por salir adelante financieramente a costa de los demás. Al mismo tiempo, el hombre se está separando de su esposa (Idina Menzel), se ha peleado con su voluptuosa amante/empleada (Julia Fox) y le debe una fortuna a un gangsteril pariente (Eric Bogosian), quien lo asedia con sus matones. El adjetivo frenético no empieza a describir la energía con que los Safdie conducen este thriller cómico que, como buenos neoyorquinos, evidencia la influencia hiperactiva de Martin Scorsese (quien funge como productor ejecutivo) y el bajo mundo de Abel Ferrara. En comparación, hasta su anterior película, Viviendo al límite (2017), parece un ejercicio en calmada contemplación. Sandler siempre me ha parecido un cómico insufrible, pero aquí demuestra –como lo hizo antes en Embriagado de amor (Paul Thomas Anderson, 2002)– haber desperdiciado su talento protagonizando comedias chatarra. Su personaje de Howard es una mezcla de desesperación y vulgaridad que resulta graciosa al mismo tiempo que patética. Es un loser con ínfulas de winner. Igual de intensa, aunque en un tono muy diferente es la ingeniosa película española El hoyo, promisorio debut en la realización del bilbaíno Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia. Situada en un futuro distópico, la acción se sitúa en un centro penal que consiste en varios niveles –nunca se sabe cuántos– donde una plataforma desciende desde la cúspide cargada de manjares, recorriendo los pisos por minutos para que, en cada uno de ellos, un par de presos consiga comer dejando los restos para los de abajo. Cumpliéndose un mes, los presos cambian de nivel al azar. Uno de los reos (Iván Massagué) intenta idear una forma de retar al sistema, conservando algo de comida para que llegue al último nivel. El original guion de David Desola y Pedro Rivero se presta, por supuesto, a la alegoría con claras implicaciones sociopolíticas y religiosas. Como suele suceder, los de arriba se cagan (a veces, literalmente) sobre los de abajo. Y la Administración permanece como un ente abstracto que nunca se manifiesta. Gracias a un diseño de producción acertadamente minimalista, El hoyo no parece una producción modesta. Sin embargo, su riqueza está en las ideas con que la intriga se mantiene llena de suspenso hasta el final. En este tipo de propuestas, la resolución es la que suele fallar y esta no es la excepción. No obstante, la película es una combinación atractiva de thriller, ciencia-ficción y violencia gore. La noticia es que Netflix la ha adquirido para su exhibición y pronto se podrá ver en la comodidad del hogar.",POSITIVE
"Sep 12, 2019"," In the Safdie brothers' wild new movie Uncut Gems, you meet Howard Ratner's (Adam Sandler) asshole first. Seriously -- the first image that Josh and Benny Safdie give us of Howard is his insides during a colonoscopy. As he lies on his back, his rectum exposed to doctors, it's the calmest the boisterous diamond district dealer will ever be during this thrill ride, a scumbag masterpiece about jewels, basketball betting, and a frenetic moron of a man who gets into a fight with The Weeknd.  It's also an interesting spin on the Adam Sandler ""serious performance."" The Sandman, who celebrated his 53rd birthday during the film's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, has a varied filmography, to say the least. When he's good, he's very good; when he's bad... well, the less said about Jack and Jill the better. The gems, pun intended, of his filmography are frequently tender portraits of sadsacks, even if those men are prone to the occasional loud outburst. We most recently saw him exercise this in Noah Baumbach's The Meyerowitz Stories, where he plays a dad who bonds with his daughter over melancholy songs they co-write. When Sandler does win praise, it's often because he's countering his goofy-ass past, filled with movies like Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer and his five-year stint on SNL.  But Uncut Gems is a rebuke to all of that. It's Sandler going big, huge even -- and it just might be the peak of his career. There is nothing subtle about Howard, who speaks in a coarse New York accent at a persistently high pitch and wears an abundant amount of gold. Sandler's mania is a perfect match for the Safdies, who have made an adrenaline rush of a movie that's gloriously ridiculous and anxiety-inducing in equal measure.  To describe the plot cannot capture the experience of watching the action unfold in 2012 New York. Howard is a man dogged by debts, which makes his life even more difficult when he comes into possession of an entrancing black opal from Ethiopia and shows it to basketball star Kevin Garnett. KG, who plays himself, becomes obsessed with the rock, thinking it will boost his game, and asks Howard to take it for the night. From there everything spirals, getting even more insane when Howard starts betting any cash he can get on KG's games. Howard is the ultimate schmuck. He's cheating on his wife Dina (Idina Menzel), who correctly thinks he's an idiot, with his employee Julia (Julia Fox), putting the younger woman up in his Manhattan apartment while his family resides in a Long Island mansion. Every decision Howard makes seemingly brings him closer to certain doom one way or another, especially given that he's being pursued by heavies led by a terrifying Keith Williams Richards. Daniel Lopatin's score mixes electronica and opera in menacing fashion that keeps viewers' blood pressure high, but also contributes to the strange magic the Safdies are working. There's a distinct touch of the supernatural to their vision, transforming Howard's tale into a fable of sorts. In the opening moments, the camera dives into the beauty reflected in the black opal and emerges out of Howard's intestines, the otherworldly colors mixing with the grotesque guts. It's a good symbol for the rest of the movie, which finds euphoria in trashiness.  Part of the pleasure of Uncut Gems is in the Safdies' approach to casting, which is consistently surprising, mixing veterans like Sandler, Menzel, Eric Bogosian, and Judd Hirsch with newcomers like Julia Fox and celebrities doing spins on their lesser-shown personas. Garnett's role is crucial to the plot, while The Weeknd, a.k.a. Abel Tesfaye, has a showy scene, as The Weeknd.  In the end, it all comes back to Howard, who Sandler makes frustrating and captivating in equal measure. He's not lovable, but you also can't not root for the guy. At the TIFF premiere, just before the movie started, someone in the audience screamed: ""Oscar for Sandman!"" After seeing his performance in Uncut Gems, I don't think that would be such a bad idea. ",POSITIVE
"Sep 12, 2019"," There are two consistently pervasive ideas in the films of New York filmmaking duo Josh and Benny Safdie. The first is their clear affection for the art and craft of hustling. From their autobiographical drama Daddy Longlegs to their verité junkie film Heaven Knows What there’s a reliable focus on the often thrilling process of social manipulation and coercion to point where stretches could briefly be mistaken for a con man film if it weren’t for how they never lose sight of how these actions intersect with economic class. For people on the margins of society it is not just a skill but a tool of survival, which is especially true in their moody and expressive 2017 feature Good Time which saw Robert Pattinson’s Connie spend an entire evening engaging in increasingly desperate transactional interactions all across New York in attempt to bail his brother out of prison. That desperation is precisely what forces them to hone their craft. The second is the inherent pain and sadness caused by it, the rippling damages—and sometimes physical harm—of weaponizing relationships as potential resources and ignoring the real people on the opposing side of them. In Daddy Longlegs, the precarious lifestyle of Lenny (a character modeled after the Safdie brothers’ own father) is empathized with, his clear affections and efforts however eventually rub up against his increasingly volatile and horrifyingly irresponsible decision-making as a parent. In Good Time there’s not a single space or person that comes into Connie’s orbit that isn’t soon selfishly abused. The film opens with him convincing his mentally-disabled brother to rob a bank with him despite knowing the brother isn’t capable of understanding the consequences (which is why the brother needs to be bailed out of prison) and ends with him having caused the death of someone just as poor and desperate as himself. This is all a long-winded means of saying that their latest film, Uncut Gems, is a near-perfect distillation of these two ideas that dominate their work packaged in a way that is as light-on-its-feet as it is deceitfully upsetting. The film opens with a prologue set in Ethiopia (uncharacteristic for the New York duo to leave the city), which briefly details the visual allure of diamonds with a cosmic tracking shot that literally moves through them while Oneohtrix Point Never’s electronic score soars. Yet not before also acknowledging the violent, exploitative conditions of mining them; visually tying the allure and exploitation together in a way that serves to instructively color the events we’re about to see unfold. Which brings us to Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler, at the absolute top of his game), a New York City diamond runner in the year 2012 loosely based on the Safdie brothers’ father’s stint in the Diamond District. Howard runs his own jewelry shop where he sells expensive rings, watches, earrings, necklaces, and chains with gold-plated, jewel-encrusted Furbies on the end of them. He’s hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, a fact he frequently forgets because his work sees him deal such large quantities of money and he is constantly engaged in the hustle which gives him a misguided sense of power and safety. Howard is a complete whirlwind of concentrated compulsion and will, all at once, having an affair with one of his young, promising runners at work Julia (Julia Fox), supposed to be getting a divorce from his wife (Idina Menzel, hilarious in all of her exhausted knowingness) shortly after Passover, fending off his brother-in-law (Eric Bogosian)/cabal of hired muscle he is in debt with for over $100,000, and of course planning the auction sale of the titular uncut gem which he purchased from some Ethiopian Jews seen in the prologue. However things get even more complicated when his street hustling colleague (Lakeith Stanfield)–who is trying to sell knockoff Rolex’s out of his shop–introduces him to Boston Celtics power forward Kevin Garnett (now retired, but playing himself in 2012 when he was still active) who happens to be mesmerized by the diamond, and because Howard is both a huge fan of the national champion basketball player and a gambling addict he lets Garnett hold onto the rock for good luck for the game he now plans on betting on.  There’s actually no better indication of Howard’s craft than this scene, the way he fast-talk negotiates Garnett into letting him take his 2008 Championship ring as collateral for borrowing the diamond and then immediately walks over to the pawnshop where he proceeds to trade it in for cash collateral that he can use to bet on the Celtics game that night. Needless to say that decision has rippling consequences and whereas Good Time dropped us in as Connie began the adrenaline-inducing process of digging himself deeper and deeper, Uncut Gems feels like something older and wearier; there’s an entire history implied in the way Sandler interacts with the people in his orbit that makes clear he’s been doing this for far too long already and the cracks have been showing long before the cameras started rolling. He’s not the only person playing the game and he’s far from the best anymore, even if he’s frequently the loudest.  The Safdies and legendary cinematographer Darius Khondji condense Howard’s world into an anxious, claustrophobic, ground-level handheld mess of 35mm textured, controlled chaos; the camera moving through these richly layered and choreographed scenes of Howard frantically and farcically trying and failing to manage all of his spinning plates in increasingly uncontrolled spaces. Sandler is a ball of tempered impulses as characters are constantly talking at and over each other in a way that makes the sound design unbearable, and the way all these stories overlap and interact with each other frequently borders on slapstick—there’s one in particular that sees Garnett, his crew, Julia, the debt collectors, and unhappy customers all hit his shop within seconds of each other that is a complete riot. Sandler delivers one of his very best physical performances as Howard, making us genuinely feel every heated exasperation and crushing failure of his as he schemes and sweats his way all across New York City streets, cabs, and venues in garish Gucci shirts and loafers. At one point he physically flees his daughter’s school play, greeting her backstage as he literally runs away from bruisers sent by the debt collectors planning on stripping him naked and beating him—a great gag complicated by the threat violence. And beyond just the beating he’s about to receive that opening scene of violence still lingers too, leaving us with palpable tension as we’re left to watch Howard’s volatility, irresponsibility and neglect stack and all his plates begin to crash one-by-one. There’s a real sense of melancholy to Howard whose panicked insecurity and determination draws in our sympathy in a way that never excuses his overt rancor and carelessness; the terrifying bit in the climactic gambling high where he calls his wife is incredibly revealing. And there’s also a larger ethnic detail to the film in a way the Safdies have previously never dived into as overtly as they have here. The way Howard’s Jewishness interacts with not just the fact that a lot of his clients are African-American but also the historically discriminated Ethiopian Jews who provide the titular gem and a sense of mystical connection for Howard and Garnett gives the film a real sense of historicity (Garnett at one point even suggests Howard’s culpability in exploitation), the hustling-as-survival of previous Safdie films registering this time on less of a literal class level than on a more systemic, symbolic one. However by only ever implying this scope and approaching this story on such an intimate level for so much of its running time, Howard’s personality overpowers reality for so long that when reality finally hits it is genuinely shocking and painful; and the film reveals itself to have been less about Howard than it was about observing the kinds of people who are drawn to and harmed by a troubling industry of stylish surfaces that distract from the violent inner workings that allow it function. ",NEGATIVE
"Sep 12, 2019",Adam Sandler's stunning performance and an effective finale are enough to forgive the Safdie Bros. for making a movie aimed at purposefully annoying you and making you want to cover your ears,POSITIVE
"Sep 11, 2019"," The best performances by Adam Sandler, the ones that demonstrate what a magnetic actor he can be when throwing himself into a role (as opposed to taking a vacation on the Happy Madison dime), aren’t really in movies that cast him against type. Instead, they tend be in the ones that take the essential qualities of his comic shtick and somehow deepen them—the films that turn the very concept of an “Adam Sandler comedy” on its ear. In Uncut Gems, the exhilaratingly tense and deliriously funny new movie by Josh and Benny Safdie, Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a New York City jeweler who lives his life in a state of constant, self-inflicted chaos. Barreling into every scene with motor-mouthed brio, the one-time SNL player taps into a charismatic mania we’ve never quite seen from him—he’s like a young Al Pacino, bristling with ego and neurotic energy. Yet Howard isn’t so different, in basic profile, from some of the other id-driven clowns on the star’s résumé. He’s obnoxious, immature, prone to fits of rage and pleasure alike: a Sandler misfit all the way. Howard is a gambler in the purest sense. He’s not just hooked on the wins. He’s a junkie for the uncertainty, high on the queasy death-wish apprehension of impossible odds. Striking out from his base of operations, the Brooklyn jewelry shop where he hocks blinged Furbies to the celebrities guided his way by an unofficial business partner (Lakeith Stanfield), Howard has a constant stream of cash running from the pawnbrokers to the bookies. He owes money all over town, but bets every cent he gets his mitts on—a habit that’s put him in the crosshairs of some impatient lenders with hired muscle. They’re not the only ones totally exasperated by Howard and his self-destructive self-absorption. “You’re just about the most annoying person I’ve ever met,” someone says to his face. Notably, that someone is his wife (Frozen’s Idina Menzel). Remember the scene in Punch Drunk Love where Sandler, in the first truly “serious” riff on his comic persona, paced nervously around his office, the music percussively amplifying his frazzled emotional state? Uncut Gems sustains that level of stress for nearly two and a half hours, making Barry Egan look downright relaxed by comparison. The film basically opens with a zoom into a glittering gemstone, taking us on a CGI tour of its molecular architecture, until—in a prankish reveal—we realize we’re staring at the inside of a colon. This is the first time we see Howard, lying on his side in a hospital bed, a camera up his ass. It’s about the only moment in the movie where he’s not on the frenzied go. The gemstone turns out to be a black opal from Ethiopia, the new prized possession of his collection. It becomes the catalyst for a caper of pure reckless compulsion, as Sandler’s incorrigible wheeler and dealer outruns loan sharks while compounding the stakes of a dangerous hustle. Set in 2012, the plot partially and improbably revolves around that spring’s NBA Eastern Conference finals; literally keeping balls in the air, Howard ends up roping Celtics forward Kevin Garnett—playing himself in an amusing supporting turn—into his house-of-cards gambit. (The other major celebrity signifier of the time period is a cameoing The Weeknd; “He’s going to be major, even though he’s from Canada,” goes a line of hilarious off-screen dialogue.) Yet the Safdie brothers’ vision of New York feels, as usual, more out of time: a seedy mirage of the city as it once looked on screens in the ’70s and ’80s. These sibling filmmakers, authorities on Tri-State dysfunction, are addicted to chaos, too. Their last film, the gripping one-crazy-night crime drama Good Time, locked us into the headspace of another desperate schemer, a two-bit criminal played by a magnificently scummy Robert Pattinson. Uncut Gems may be the furthest the Safdies have strayed into the sphere of mainstream entertainment, but that’s very much a relative distinction; their style is still confrontational and flagrantly underground, even with a heavyweight cinematographer, Darius Khondji, providing the grubby, claustrophobic close-ups. The film’s roaring dramatic and comic engine is Howard’s impulse control issue, his inability to stop making the wrong decisions. You watch with a pit-in-the-stomach dread usually reserved for people in horror movies wandering blithely into mortal danger. Early in the film, the Safdies establish a ticking-clock deadline and then proceed to have their hapless hero completely ignore it—an ingenious assault on the nerves. They assemble a whole, rich ensemble of character actors and interesting nonprofessionals, then reduce most of them to enraged and flabbergasted spectators. (Eric Bogosian, the Talk Radio playwright, gets one of the better roles as a fed-up relative looking to collect what he’s owed—a dynamic that leads to an amusingly tense Passover.) Of everyone caught in the orbit of Howard’s obsessive self-sabotage, only his twentysomething mistress (Julia Fox, in a terrific breakout performance) has any patience left for him. It takes a while to recognize her loyalty as its own form of addiction: the devotion of a coconspirator in bedlam. All the while, the Safdies audaciously enhance the anxiety with one of their most abrasive soundscapes: a mixture of Altmanesque overlapping dialogue, disconcertingly loud noises (like the persistent buzz of a broken automatic door lock), and a blaring electronic score that sometimes seems intent on drowning everything else out. Of course, the real source of anxiety is Howard himself, who’s responsible for every one of his problems. In the last 45 minutes, the film reaches a spectacular fever pitch of almost suicidal abandon—the havoc wreaked by a man who just can’t resist and would rather stop trying to. We watch his foolhardy flirtation with ruin in a state of shocked disbelief that borders on admiration. The queasy thrill of Sandler’s live-wire performance is the way he keys us right into Howard’s electric joy, putting everything on the line, consequences be damned. It’s a pure shot of the gambler’s high, and Uncut Gems gets us hooked on it, too. By the end, you want to hurl and cheer.",POSITIVE

"Sep 11, 2019"," Every now and then, we get a phenomenal performance from Adam Sandler.  Punch-Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Funny People, The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected), and Uncut Gems feature such performances.  We get a career-best in the film.  It helps that he’s able to get out of his comfort zone.  He’s not in a film being written by the traditional writers that we’re so used to seeing. Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler) is a jeweler working in New York City.  Ratner does have his flaws but this goes without saying.  However, Ratner has some issues with money management.  In this case, he likes to bet big on sporting events.  Yet he must do so while fulfilling both work and family obligations.  It’s not always easy and sometimes, he’ll stay at the apartment in the city.  Things change when an uncut opal gem finally arrives from the Welo Mines of Ethiopia.  But just as soon as he plans to auction it off for over $1 million, Boston Celtics legend Kevin Garnett (himself) arrives in his shop during a break in the action from the 2012 NBA Playoffs.  Let’s just say that Ratner shows KG the gem and he starts to obsess over it. The whole subplot involving Kevin Garnett is fascinating.  At some point, I started to wonder if the film would ever return to some particular plot points.  I won’t say what they are but for a while, it was looking like a plot hole or two.  Sure enough, the film does its thing and not a moment too soon.  But speaking of basketball, there’s a nice reference to Ossie Schectman.  He scored the first basket in basketball.  Similarly, I highly recommend checking out The First Basket: The Greatest Jewish Basketball Documentary Ever.  Anyway, I digress.  It was just nice to revisit the Boston Celtics vs. Philadelphia 76ers series in 2012.

"Sep 11, 2019"," Adam Sandler’s Howard Ratner, a small-time jeweler with a gambling addiction, is the latest in a line of hapless hustlers pushed to extremes in an adrenalized cinematic realm that could only have been conceived by filmmaker brothers Josh and Benny Safdie. From the outset of Uncut Gems, Howard spins a dizzying number of plates to stay ahead of creditors, pawning jewelry loaned to him by customers to raise money he needs to pay off sharks, only to instead drop cash on the latest basketball odds. Howard is a man for whom the big score is always just on the horizon, and were he not barreling toward disaster, and without any brakes, you’d almost have to admire his endless optimism. Howard’s precarious balancing act is maintained on sheer force of will, and even amid the typically antic pitch of the Safdies’ filmography, his single-mindedness is overwhelming. Much of Uncut Games consists of Howard attempting to dominate every conversation, fast-talking over everyone from clients to creditors to his own wife, Dinah (Idina Menzel), whose clenched-jaw loathing of her asinine husband signals that their marriage is in its late stages. But Howard, like so many of the Safdies’ protagonists, makes the fatal error of believing himself to be the only true swindler in any given room, despite occupying an underworld populated entirely by hustlers. Howard never fools anyone; at best, he talks so rapidly and incessantly to his debtors that he momentarily dazes them long enough to momentarily evade them. By the time we meet Howard, though, this fragile way of life is starting to crumble. The jeweler is so heavily in dept to Arno (Eric Bogosian), an in-law and loan shark whose hired muscle (Keith Williams Richards) threatens Howard with beatings, that he attempts a Hail Mary move to get out of debt by way of ordering a valuable opal from an Ethiopian gem mine in the hopes of auctioning it for a massive profit. But because he cannot help himself, Howard complicates things by letting Kevin Garnett borrow the opal after the Celtics center visits his shop with another hustler, Demany (Lakeith Stanfield, radiating a shrewd, brooding variant of Howard’s more frantic scheming). It’s a potentially win-win situation, as Garnett needs a good-luck charm during the Eastern Conference finals and Howard hopes to bet on the Celtics winning, but things, of course, go awry after Garnett hoards the opal and backstabs Demany. The stress of the situation wreaks havoc on Howard, and the man’s hopelessness brings out the best in Sandler. The actor’s gift as a comic has always lied in his volcanic rage relative to his characters’ inconsequentiality and powerlessness, and Howard is a fountain of impotent fury. His attempts to sound calm suggest a man trying hard not to scream, which he frequently does when trying to speak over the din of practically emasculating group arguments. Howard issues orders with a finality that would convey authority were he not ignored by literally everyone, and the more Howard cajoles and threatens the more pathetic he seems. The film compounds Howard’s diminishing sense of strength with a punishing sound mix that elevates the overlapping dialogue into howls of white noise in which only fragments of people’s sentences can be gleaned at certain times. In their films, the Safdies always stress the omnipresence of street noise and the chaos of conversation between more than a handful of people, but Uncut Gems sees them pushing the decibel levels of their sound design to new and deafening heights. And that’s before you factor in Daniel Lopatin’s score, a shimmering, ringing chime of synthesizers that evokes light refracting off of precious stones. That quality, that suggestion of a gem’s glittering hardness, can also be found in Darius Khondji’s cinematography, which, with its metallic color timing and reflective sheens, is in stark contrast to the grimy, sweat-streaked naturalism of Sean Price Williams’s work for the Safdies. As in Good Time, Uncut Gems finds the Safdies working in genre rooted in the grimy, character-oriented crime films of the ’70s. In Howard’s doomed figure is something of Ben Gazzara’s character from The Killing of a Chinese Bookie, a social climber who keeps slipping on the bottom rungs and whose individual tragedy illuminates the emptiness of the systems that define him. But where Cassavetes foregrounds his protagonist’s woes, the promises of the American work ethic that push him to the edge of cynical despair, the Safdies stress the irreconcilable contradictions of late capitalism. Throughout Uncut Gems, they illustrate how even a small business owner can be implicated in a global network of misery-making, one that connects the exploitation of African labor to the pressures of social status that compel athletes, rappers, and everyday social aspirants to want to own the products of that labor. Furthermore, the filmmakers trace the alienation that comes of this globalized system on a micro scale by observing the ethnic tensions between and within communities that alienate Howard from his mostly African-American clientele and even members of his own Jewish family. The film’s climax inverts convention by showing the “hero” getting the villains exactly where he wants them, only to monologue and give away his advantage. Howard’s folly is a testament to how far removed he’s become from reality, as he’s unable to see how his elaborate bricolage of bets and schemes become the jaws of a closing trap.

"Sep 10, 2019","  I frequently say that characters don’t need to be likable; they just need to be compelling. Pretty much every single character in Josh & Benny Safdie’s new movie Uncut Gems is someone you wouldn’t want to spend more than five minutes with, but they’re not particularly interesting either. It’s a collection of self-destructive, self-indulgent people or outright bullies and they spend most of the movie just yelling at each other. But that’s a good environment for the King of Angry Yelling, Adam Sandler, a man who has yelled at everything from crowds to a golf ball. Uncut Gems is an exhausting grind, but Sandler’s fury and comic timing are perfectly suited to this tale of angry scumbags.   Howard Ratner (Sandler) is a diamond dealer in New York City who can’t stop obliterating his own life. He’s deeply in debt to loan sharks but keeps placing huge bets on sporting events. After receiving a valuable opal, Howard thinks selling it at auction will solve all his problems, but foolishly decides to loan it to NBA superstar Kevin Garnett (as himself). With loan sharks closing in and his debts piling up, Howard struggles to get the opal back and win big before his entire life falls apart.   Uncut Gems isn’t really a movie where you “root” for anyone. Howard’s best case scenario is indulging his gambling habit and cheating on his wife (Idina Menzel) with his hot employee, Julia (Julia Fox). Instead, we watch Howard make a string of stupid, self-destructive moves and then get into a screaming match with everyone he meets. This is the film from the opening credits and it lasts for over two hours. Some might find Howard’s self-destructive spiral interesting, but for me it was repetitive and predictable. You know that no matter what happens, Howard is his own worst enemy and so we just have to wait and see the next uncomfortable interaction. It’s similar to the Safdies’ previous movie, Good Time, but without the protagonist’s good intentions.   The saving grace is Sandler. I don’t even know if I’d qualify his work here as a “great performance” since it’s not like he’s really stretching himself to play a guy who yells at everyone, but he’s great for this role. He shows no need to be liked, but he has the comic timing to keep us engaged with Howard’s obnoxious shenanigans and the energy to sustain his endless rage. It’s a testament to Sandler’s devotion that he keeps Howard entertaining even though the character isn’t all that complex or nuanced.   But because the character is a self-destructive black hole surrounded by other self-serving characters, Uncut Gems, with its aggressive cinematography and score, just feels like a drain. It’s not a “crazy” movie; just a very loud one. If someone were to shout in your face for 135 minutes, you wouldn’t question their devotion, but you’d still eventually find it tedious and irritating all the same. There are those who might enjoy Howard’s constant implosion, but I quickly became impatient for the collapse.  Matt Goldberg has been an editor with Collider since 2007.

"Sep 10, 2019"," In Uncut Gems, the Safdie brothers’ anxiety-inducing follow-up to Good Time, we spend over two hours attached at the hip to Adam Sandler, a prospect that might not seem particularly thrilling. But the guy who signed a mammoth deal with Netflix “because it rhymes with wet chicks” is also the guy who chose to work with Paul Thomas Anderson and Noah Baumbach, film-makers willing to look beyond the fart jokes to see an actor who just needs to be directed. Both roles were particularly compelling not just because they represented such a dramatic departure from the kind of movie we associate him with but also because his style of acting was suddenly so transformed. Often when comedy stars “go serious”, you can see the shadow of their funnier selves in every scene, but when taken out of his comfort zone, the Sandler we know virtually disappears. There was humour in both Punch-Drunk Love and The Meyerowitz Stories but it was awkward and intimate, more likely to make one shift in their seat than guffaw. Sandler has an under-appreciated ability to connect with the uncomfortable aspects of his more fleshed out characters, embarrassingly so at times, and his latest, arguably greatest, delve into drama pushes this to a whole new level. He plays fast-talking jewelry dealer Howard Ratner, a man who spends his days frantically trying to make money while being followed by the men he owes money to, an exhausting lifestyle he can’t seem to escape. But the more we get to know Howard, the less it seems like he wants to, forever inserting himself in increasingly precarious situations. Howard is the best, and worst, kind of antihero, caught in a trap of his own making, a way out always frustratingly in sight. As in Good Time, the Safdies have plotted out a perilous obstacle course for their protagonist involving the NBA player Kevin Garnett, a rare opal from an Ethiopian mine, a soon-to-be-ex wife and The Weeknd, and despite Howard continually testing our patience, we are unavoidably invested, sighing at his every misstep, figuring out whether we want him to succeed or fail. It’s an intentionally stressful experience, not just because of Howard’s aggressively frustrating character but because the Safdies take pleasure in our displeasure. The film packs in so many raised voices, blaring soundtrack choices and gaudy visuals that it often feels like a rather obnoxious sensory overload but we’re never alienated because there’s a deceptive delicacy behind these excesses. We’re hurtling through the world that Howard lives and works in and it’s not patronisingly translated or sanitised for us, it’s just presented as is, and I admired how atmospheric they made it, a world I never once doubted. I also never once doubted Sandler, whose incisive character work here is probably the most impressive acting we have seen from him to date. It would have been far too easy to turn Howard into an overly mannered cartoon but Sandler opts for something far more precise and grounded. It’s a performance entirely lacking in vanity – he makes Howard buffoonish at times, unpleasant at others – and despite being an immediately recognisable star, my idea of Sandler and what he represents quickly faded once the film began. It’s a turn as immersive as the film around him and makes you crave more outside of his almost entirely useless Netflix deal. It’s a remarkable match-up between film-makers and actor and reaffirms the importance of that partnership, especially for a movie star stuck in a profitable rut. Sandler deserves more, and if he wants us to keep watching, then so do we.",POSITIVE
"Sep 10, 2019"," Brash doesn’t come close to describing New York jeweller Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), a slippery hustler with a satin shirt, a voice like metal shavings and a diamond-hard veneered smile. With creditors baying for money, Howard’s life is one long high-stakes gamble. He lives for the score. And the biggest win of his career is tied up in a black opal, obtained from an Ethiopian mine in a manner which is not entirely above board. The latest from the Safdie brothers is a cracking follow up to Good Time: a jangling panic attack of a movie and a timely reminder that, when he puts his mind to it, Adam Sandler can be one of the finest actors currently working. A December 13th US release by A24 should ensure that Sandler figures as an awards contender, for a performance which transcends even that of Punch Drunk Love for jittery intensity. Elsewhere, the picture will be a Netflix release, however the enthusiastic response from festival screenings – the picture shows in Toronto following its premiere in Telluride – should prompt audiences to seek it out on a big screen where possible. Certainly, the vivid urgency of Darius Khondji’s cinematography cries out to be experienced on the largest, most immersive format available. The picture opens with a brutal prologue in that Ethiopian opal mine. Two workers use the distraction of a grisly injury to illicitly chisel a massive black opal from the mine. The camera lingers, fascinated, on the stone before diving into it. And in a way, we never actually leave it. The whole colour palette of the picture is saturated with the seductive colours of the gem – aqueous blues and greens, and fire flashes of pink and orange. It looks sensational, although, with the wired pacing and rattling editing, it is not a restful experience. The visual assault is matched by the sound. Howard approaches conversation like a machine gun duel; over the jostling layers of dialogue, Daniel Lopatin’s twitchy electronic score adds a further element of tension. As does the fact that many of the most hectic scenes play out in rooms which always feel slightly too small for the number of people crammed into them. One such room is Howard’s showroom, where he tries to hustle bling to the athletes and celebrities brought to him by his middleman Demany (Lakeith Stanfield, excellent). A buzzer operated airlock security system provides one the funniest scenes in a picture in which humour comes as a welcome release from the tightly wound stress. Another is the dining room in which his extended family – including at least one person to whom he owes money – gather for passover dinner. While his wife (Idina Menzel) smiles thinly in a half-hearted show of unity for the children’s sake, Howard checks a text message from his on-off girlfriend under the table. He’s a man addicted to risk who charges headlong into each new get-rich gamble, a slightly more socially acceptable spin on Robert Pattinson’s character in Good Time. The Safdies clearly have a type. This level of nervous tension for over two hours is as tough on the audience as it is on the central characters. It’s bracing, but also exhausting. Relief, when it finally comes, feels like a mercy bullet to the brain. Screen International is the essential resource for the international film industry.

"Sep 10, 2019"," Adam Sandler’s greatest strength is his flair for the ridiculous. It doesn’t matter if he’s blue-suited anger bomb Barry Egan in Punch-Drunk Love or garbling buffoon Bobby Boucher Jr in The Waterboy – a problem is a problem is a problem, and his characters, a motley crew of outcasts, weirdos and nasal-voiced nobodies, tend to have a lot of them. He cut his teeth as a comedian on variety sketch show Saturday Night Live alongside the likes of Phil Hartman and Chris Farley, before transitioning into a career as the King of Lowbrow Comedy which made him a beloved bannerman for the North American nebbish. Sandler sceptics cite his ‘serious’ work with Paul Thomas Anderson and Noah Baumbach as proof of a talent that is rarely exploited to its full potential, but there’s no need to hold up evidence as part of this thesis. If you know, you know. He’s a gifted performer, and when he deigns to channel that into a project as masterfully constructed as Josh and Benny Safdie’s Uncut Gems, the results are nothing short of dazzling. A decade ago, fresh off their second feature Daddy Longlegs, the Safdie brothers tried to convince Sandler to star in their next movie. It was a long shot, given their lack of credentials – they were small time indie directors with just two features under their belts – and predictably, the conversation was shut down pretty quickly. (Sandler went on to make Jack and Jill, and sign a multi million-dollar deal with streaming service Netflix.) In 2017, after their frenetic Queens runaround Good Time took Cannes (and, later, the world) by storm, Sandler became aware of their work, and now, a project some 10 years in the making arrives fully-formed and ready to shake down audiences with all the gusto of a debt collector who’s fast running out of patience. It’s important to note this because it would be inaccurate to suggest anything about Uncut Gems is left to chance. Its frantic energy gives it a feeling of looseness, but this is precision-engineered filmmaking which creates that staggering illusion. In fact, it’s only on repeat viewings that you really gain a sense of just how meticulous the film is; the first time around, it feels like sensory overload. The intoxicating score by Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) is a shape-shifting chimera. It draws inspiration from mid-2000s club tracks through to choral interludes, and in the sumptuous production and costume design there’s enough gold, silver and precious stones to put the Tower of London’s collection to shame. Add to the mix high-stakes gambling, mounting debts with circling loan sharks, a complicated domestic situation, and a smuggled Ethiopian black opal, and you have a recipe for exhilarating, unbridled disaster. Sandler, as always, is at the heart of the chaos. As New York diamond dealer Howard Ratner, his uniform is striking: rimless Cartier glasses, a Ferragamo logo belt, Gucci horsebit loafers. He looks put together, if not anachronistic – a relic of old money who’s either unconcerned with or unable to keep up with the latest trends. He has a beautiful soon-to-be-ex-wife named Dinah (Idina Menzel), and three kids, who live in a plush mini-mansion in Long Island, while Howard works in Manhattan selling jewellery to basketball players and entertains a sweet romance with employee, Julia (Julia Fox). But Ratner, like all of the Safdies’ struggling protagonists, is paddling frantically to keep his head above water. The Safdies, alongside co-writer Ronald Bronstein, are uniquely skilled when it comes to inventing protagonists who remain empathetic even when they’re unlikable. We understand Howard’s thought processes, even when we might despise him, and Sandler – King of the Underdogs for so long it’s sometimes easy to forget he’s now worth half a billion dollars – has the charisma to carry it off. He scrambles for control, and the second he has it he gambles it all away. A remarkable sense of pathos is evoked watching him bumble through life, locked in the trunk of his own car or cracking wise at the seder with his extended family. You root for him, even when he gets knocked down by the hired goons he owes money to. You want Howard to catch the break he’s been chasing for what seems like his whole life. But he is searching for a high that only ever lasts for a few seconds, and respite in Uncut Gems only comes in feverish, stolen gulps. A scene in a UV-lit nightclub sees Howard look on while The Weeknd performs ‘The Morning’ – a rare moment of near-stillness amid the carnage. “All that money / the money is the motive,” the singer croons, speaking directly to the obsession threatening to derail our wily protagonist’s life once and for all. Tension comes in the most remarkable of places: watching NBA All-Star Kevin Garnett play basketball becomes as great a feat of anxiety-inducing cinema as any high-stakes heist. In a film so rich with the iconography of Jewish identity and all-American decadence, it’s easy to get lost in the details; in the bedazzled Furbies, the mint green and baby pink walls of Howard’s office, the gold Mezuzah pendant he wears around his neck. But Uncut Gems is a sleight of hand trick, ready to land all its trumps while you’re still fumbling for the Queen of Hearts. This might be more polished than the Safdies’ past work thanks to Darius Khondji’s svelte cinematography and Lopatin’s ambitious, turbulent score, but it’s no less real or bruising on impact. Over the course of five fiction films, the Safdie brothers have created a series of anarchic but always deeply compassionate snapshots of human rot across the five boroughs of New York, while simultaneously demonstrating their unmistakable love and affection for the city that raised them. They continue to reckon with the idea of how self-interest shapes a person’s every move while maintaining a neurotic sense of humour, and their stories are laden with self-induced suffering that never feels mawkish. Their blunt perceptiveness and flair for corralling entropy onto cinema screens, allied with a truly unforgettable Sandler performance, mark Uncut Gems as not only a ludicrous achievement in technical finesse, but unrelenting creativity as well. It’s stylish and sad and funny and bleak and a thousand other things. But most of all, it’s a pure hit of Sandler and Safdie.

"Sep 2, 2019"," It’s warmer than usual at this year’s Telluride Film Festival, which kicked off for the 46th time on a distinctly muscular note on Friday with the world premiere of James Mangold’s “Ford v Ferrari,” a '60s-set adrenaline rusher with top-shelf technical craftsmanship. The ever-versatile filmmaker Mangold has tried his creative hand at many a genre; from Westerns (“3:10 to Yuma”) and musical biopics (“Walk the Line”), to rom-coms (“Kate & Leopold”), superhero films (“Logan”) and beyond. In “Ford v Ferrari,” which tells the true story of Ford Motor Company’s building of an unassailable race car to take on Ferrari at “24 Hours of Le Mans,” the world’s oldest and most prestigious sports car race, he pulls from his diverse chops in heaps and delivers something both old-school-Hollywood and state-of-the-art, with deafening sound design, brisk editing and Phedon Papamichael’s often sun-baked, knee-weakening lensing being the real stars. At the heart of the film is a bromance between the legendary car designer Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon, at ease with his character’s confidence) and hotheaded, wisecracking driver Ken Miles (Christian Bale, heavily accented and humorously arrogant). The former is a poised and polished artist and engineer, hired by Henry Ford II (Tracy Letts) to beat Ferrari and bring the company’s young vision to life for competitive survival. The latter is an often-curt war veteran and not quite the wholesome image Ford would like to wear on its sleeve. But convincing the corporation’s hotshots that Miles is the only man who can drive the brand-new roaring machine, the duo embark on a classic sports movie journey where male egos get bruised to a sometimes-laughable extent (the whole Hollywood-ized ordeal starts because Henry Ford is insecure about being “the second”) and families face the threat of irreparable turmoil. Equally fast and furious in this year’s Telluride lineup is “Uncut Gems,” a constantly-on-the-move urban thriller from the New York filmmaking duo Josh and Benny Safdie. Over the years, the brothers have developed a distinguished and recognizable cinematic language, redefining the typical “New York Movie,” or rather, inventing their very own by unearthing overlooked communities and individuals in various corners of the relentless city. The filmmakers’ latest, hinted by a brilliantly double-edged title, is a manic plunge into the city’s Diamond District. While it’s an overused cliché, it wouldn’t be inappropriate to call this thoroughly on-steroids film an edge-of-your-seat experience, as it truly earns the saying. With a serious and surprisingly hectic Adam Sandler in the lead, “Uncut Gems” knowingly agitates one’s senses as soon as the first bloody image from a distant African country takes over the screen, before the story makes a leap to New York City. From this point on, we’re gloriously suffocated in dark alleys, grimy bachelor pads and the florescent-lit backrooms of jewelry stores, which Darius Khondji’s restless camera captures on film, with apt grit and grain. Co-written by Ronald Bronstein, the Safdies’ latest carries deposits of both “Heaven Knows What” and “Good Time” in the way the risk-taking camera frantically moves with the backdrop of an alarming, electronic score (composed by Daniel Lopatin of “Good Time”) and self-sabotaging characters with poor judgment routinely make bad decisions in moments of severe crisis. And as was the case with “Good Time,” there are traces of noir classics and New York thrillers, too, with “Mean Streets” being among the most fitting comparison points. Here, we follow a semi-neurotic businessman/scammer named Howard Ratner (Sandler). In the midst of a crumbling marriage (his wife is played by a mesmerizing Idina Menzel, who should really be in more movies) and an escalating scheme that involves a valuable stone as his newly acquired precious possession (the opening scene pays off disturbingly), Ratner goes to extremes in trying to keep a predictable tragedy at arm’s length. But both the longevity of his business and his physical safety get buried deeper in threat, and it wouldn’t be a spoiler to say the inevitable eventually arrives, though perhaps more violently and shockingly than anyone could imagine. Dark, disturbing and gloriously rich on cultural details—especially in portraying Ratner’s Jewish background and customs—“Uncut Gems” is easily among this year’s best titles in the festival line-up, with well-conceived side characters (played by the likes of LaKeith Stanfield and Kevin Garnett portraying himself) as memorable as Sandler in a demanding, career-best performance. Another career-best comes from writer/director Noah Baumbach in the form of “Marriage Story,” his masterpiece that made the long, strenuous trip from Venice, Italy to the mountains of Colorado over the weekend. Paired with an Adam Driver tribute award at the festival, “Marriage Story” already left a deeply poignant mark as a near-definitive relationship and divorce drama, akin to Robert Benton's “Kramer vs. Kramer” and Ingmar Bergman’s timeless “Scenes from a Marriage.” If Baumbach has scratched the surface of maturing romantic relationships before with “The Squid and the Whale” and “While We Were Young,” he peels off their skin here, exposing all the flesh-and-blood secrets of coupledom, painful and joyous. In the midst of your laughter and tears (they will be well-earned), you will wonder if someone had secretly eavesdropped in your bedroom that you share with your significant other and somehow possessed the power of seeing through your unspoken thoughts. How else could a movie throw such accurate wisdoms at your face, casually identifying that “everything is like everything else in a relationship” (sex and conversation for instance) or comparing the demise of a marriage to death; to a funeral without a body? But this is what the best of movies do; they see us as we truly are. In “Marriage Story” the two parts of the we are Nicole and Charlie, played by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both at the height of their craft in bringing to life a couple once in love, now in rapid decline. They are New York creatives: an actor who gave up her feasible Hollywood dreams and an on-the-rise avant-garde theater director, respectively. They have a young son, whose cross-country custody battle would soon briefly dehumanize the pair’s vision of each other. But they had been in-synch once; we hear all the reasons why and how they became a “we” in a joyous opening. And it’s all been in the details: she knows how to buy and wrap a good present. She knows how to listen and make people feel at ease. He keeps things in order. He is a great father. He saves energy and turns the lights off. (If you are married, or tied in an otherwise committed bond, I dare you to watch this sequence and not draw similarities to your own relationship.) It’s tough to do justice to “Marriage Story,” hilarious and heartbreaking in equal measure, in capsule form. But suffice to say that this is perhaps the most compassionate and smart film I’ve seen on marriage and divorce, elevated by Randy Newman’s heartbreaking score, and precise craftsmanship that approaches lengthy monologues, interior spaces, and the visual contrast between LA and NYC with the majesty and precision that they require. Between Laura Dern’s feisty LA attorney (facing lawyers played by a kindly Alan Alda and ruthless Ray Liotta) and Julie Hagerty’s pitch-perfect free-spirited mother, the joys, grace notes and riches of Baumbach’s latest are endless. But its greatest triumph is its generosity in refusing to leave you shattered in pieces, even after putting you through an exquisitely written and acted scene of marital strife. Sometimes, you say the most hurtful, even shameful things in the heat of the moment. But being alive means learning to move on, with bruised heart and spirit still intact.

"Sep 1, 2019"," Josh Safdie and Benny Safdie have been making short films since 2005 but in 2017 their film, Good Times recieved a lot of critical acclaim including multiple Independent Spirit Award nominations. Now, two years later, Josh and Benny are releasing their newest film, Uncut Gems right in time for award season. Uncut Gems is being released by A24 and held its World Premiere at the 46th Annual Telluride Film Festival which is where I saw the film. Uncut Gems was a passion project for the Safdie Brothers. During a Q&A at Telluride, the brothers spoke about how they have been anxiously waiting almost 10 years to make this film. They always knew they wanted Adam Sandler for the film but it wasn’t until the release of Good Times that their dreams of getting the script into Sandler’s hands became a reality. It seems to me that Adam Sandler is having somewhat of a career renaissance in 2019.  Murder Mystery became the biggest film to ever be released on Netflix and now, with Uncut Gems, he delivers a captivating performance that is one of his best to date. Sandler plays Howard Ratner, a smooth-talking New York jeweler with a massive gambling problem. He owes money to more people than he can keep track of so he’s always looking for ways to get more. Howard discovers an Ethiopian mine where there are rocks filled with rare and valuable black opals. He manages to track one down and has it delivered to his jewelry store in Manhattan. Once the rock arrives, Howard opens it with much excitement because he figures that the opals are worth over $3,000 a carat. He quickly puts the rock in an auction and hopes for it to sell for over a million dollars . Unfortunately, Howard’s hits some unexpected roadblocks including bookies, mobsters, and the Boston Celtics’ Kevin Garnett. Uncut Gems is polarizing and definitely not a film for everyone. I can totally see how certain audiences will struggle to connect with the film due to the shady characters, jarring storytelling, and a overbearing soundtrack. The film is an attack on the senses in many ways because it constantly keeps moving and never slows down. From the very first scene until the end credits, you are experiencing life the way that Howard lives it which is full of chaos and uncertainty. However, you quickly learn that those are the things that drive him and keep him going. Howard is the type of person who isn’t happy sitting in an office. Instead, he spends his time running around New York City trying to track down his next big score while trying to avoid conflict with others. Most of Uncut Gems relies on Adam Sandler’s performance and he absolutely crushes it. About five minutes into this film, you know exactly the type of person that Howard Ratner is. He can sell anything to anyone and nothing is ever enough. He has no problem lying or manipulating others including his own family. He ignores his wife and kids on a regular basis and has a short fuse whenever things don’t go his way. Sandler plays Howard as a man who lives in a constant state of panic with a plethora of insecurities. There is a great moment in the film where Howard breaks down crying to his mistress Julia (Julia Fox), who also happens to work in his jewelry store.  There is such an authenticity to this scene and Sandler perfectly captured it. There are multiple moments throughout the film where I found myself shaking my head in disbelief. Not because what was happening on-screen was unrealistic, but because I couldn’t believe the risks that this guy was taking. There are numerous points where it felt like Howard was about to turn things around but as it turns out, he is not only addicted to gambling but the rush that it gives him. As a viewer, I felt that rush and it was what kept me so fixated on this character. Howard, as well as the majority of the characters in Uncut Gems, don’t have much of a moral code per se. Everyone is out for themselves so if you are looking for a film with characters that you can get behind and root for, this isn’t that movie. Personally, I liked that all of the characters especially Howard were all sort of soulless. They live in the moment and don’t care whatsoever about how their actions impact others. The scenes between Howard and Dinah (Idina Menzel) are so fascinating because Howard doesn’t seem to comprehend that she knows he is full of shit. My only real complaint with Uncut Gems is that the scrore is relentless and incredibly overwhelming. The loud synth-based soundtrack plays constantly throughout and there were multiple times where it took me out of the film completely. As a result, this not only hurt the storytelling but the performances. I can see how some will refer to Uncut Gems as a headache-inducing film because when you combine the soundtrack with everything else going on in the film, it is a lot to take in. While I don’t expect to see the same level of critical praise from Uncut Gems that Safdie Brothers recieved from Good Times, I do think this film confirms that their careers are just getting started. Uncut Gems is a pulse-pounding film that is as captivating as it is disorienting.  Adam Sandler’s performance is truly terrific and one of the best of his career. If you are a fan of the Safdie Brothers, you don’t want to miss this one.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2019"," There’s a karmic power to the titular stones of Uncut Gems, Josh and Benny Safdie’s startling whirligig of a character study.  And the movie knows it. Why else would a chaotic Adam Sandler film about the New York diamond district open in the Welo opal mines of Ethiopia, zeroing in on the distraught face and open wounds of an injured black miner? Not that there isn’t precedent for this sort of thing: see films like Blood Diamond, with their flattering liberal awareness and ostensibly political style. In that case, though, the art is merely a venue for bearing witness to colonial destruction at a safe remove, a posture meant to stoke only the most obvious, helpless anger. Uncut Gems is another kind of movie altogether—a great one, for starters. And again, it announces this difference in its opening minutes: with a close-up on gorgeous black opals that transports us, Magic School Bus-style, from the mines of the their origin to the similarly cavernous innards of Howard Ratner (Sandler). Howard, the Jewish diamond dealer whose fate, we soon learn, is bound up with that of the stones, is in the middle of a colonoscopy when we meet him. The moment affords at least one obvious meaning: Uncut Gems is a movie that lives in the gut, where shit makes a name for itself, where anxiety, folly, and instinct are borne out without morality or restriction. Howard’s own guts, meanwhile, are a repository for the haplessly self-destructive impulses that push him every which way but toward reason or satisfaction. Uncut Gems will end the way it began—serving up another flesh-bound tour of Howard’s body that again migrates toward something vast, cosmic, unknown. By then, though, the substance of these connections, to say nothing of their terrifying implications, will be clear. And the immutable havoc wreaked couldn’t feel more grim. Uncut Gems, co-written by the Safdies and longtime collaborator Ronald Bronstein, is a movie about a gambling addict whose most consistent bet is on his own life. Howard is a loud, restless, successful merchant of needlessly gaudy swag. His stock is equal parts attractive and repulsive: a diamond-encrusted crucifix with Michael Jackson as Jesus; diamond-studded Furbies on chains; stolen but rich-looking Rolex watches; any variety of “new money” albatross fit for the necks of rappers, ballers, and the like. He’s living the life: a (soon to be ex)-wife and kids on Long Island, a young employee-girlfriend that he’s set up in a swank apartment uptown, and a grab-bag of sports gambling debts that he’s somehow, to this point, managed to evade through an intricate network of lies, scams, pawned items, and luck. Constant threats on his own life notwithstanding, of course. When fellow hustler Demany (LaKeith Stanfield) shows up with a new prospective client, Kevin Garnett (playing himself), Howard can’t help but show off his newfangled riches: black opals, which he’d learned of only two years ago on the History Channel and had imported for the sake of an auction scam. He feels a connection to the stones: the Ethiopians who dug them up were fellow Jews, after all, a fact he relates with an almost mystical fervor. That doesn’t stop him from trying to exploit the value of the gems, mind you. And it doesn’t stop him from letting Garnett borrow the stone for the weekend: it’s a good-luck charm to get him through Eastern Conference finals, or so the story goes. It obviously doesn’t work out that way—“obviously” because this is a crime movie on its face, telegraphing from the start that though Howard’s problems are of his own making, their consequences have long ago slipped his control. It’s also, more urgently, a gratifying summary of the Safdie brothers’ career to date. The thirty-something pair have by now made a name for themselves as creators of gritty, persistently uncomfortable New York movies such as 2017’s Good Time and their breakout Heaven Knows What, films that were already extensions of the brothers’ streetwise, comically anxious, ethnically specific shorts and early features. Gems picks up where that other work left off. It deepens the acute racial tensions dredged up by Good Time, in which Robert Pattinson played a veritable get-over king who wielded his wiles and power over women to rescue his intellectually disabled brother (played by Ben Safdie) from prison. It shares with heroin chronicle Heaven Knows What a sense of inevitable tragedy, wending a wandering-but-sharp path through its protagonists’ persistently destructive addictions. And like those other films, Gems revels in ecstasy: the mysterious allure of the black opal, the pleasurable closure one feels when zipping closed a bag full of money, the deluded optimism of a gambler who gets what they came for and thinks, Why not more? Typical for the Safdies, Gems takes a ground-eye view of its characters’ comings and goings. Note the redundant running and hustling from place to place, our constant awareness of the buzzer that separates the world of Howard’s store from the dangers just waiting to get a leg in. The Safdies set their characters loose on the world like bombs without targets, supplementing their street realism with energetic visual sleights—sudden pans, confrontational tracking shots—that make the world feel custom-built for conflict. Their usual cinematographer, the essential New York indie stalwart Sean Price Williams, has been replaced here by the eminent Darius Khondji, who pushes the directors’ usual vision towards new extremes. It feels essential to the film's visual ideas that its Jewish characters’ skin tone is consistently brown, for example, and always clearly ethnically marked—an apt thematic provocation that at times feels like a consequence of ingenious lighting and lensing. A Sandler/Safdie collaboration should frankly have felt inevitable, but for the fact that (Punch-Drunk Love excepted) Sandler hasn’t frequently leant his celebrity to independent fare. It couldn’t have worked out better, in this case. I’m a longtime fan of Sandler, and of his schtick; I know his grab-bag of gestures and jokes as well as any other living actor’s. And yet I wasn’t prepared for Uncut Gems, which pushes his comic persona far toward the malicious insecurities that have long given Sandler his fire. Classic Safdie characters are brash, volatile—as are Sandler’s. Here, juiced up with an awful mustache and a personal style befitting his awful merchandise, he unleashes untold reserves of mania and panic. I can barely think of a moment in the film in which Sandler isn’t screaming. It helps to have a supporting cast that is so game, and so good, and equally prone to screaming—particularly Idina Menzel as Howard’s put-upon firecracker of a wife; Julia Fox as his girlfriend; and Eric Bogosian as an in-law to whom Howard owes just a fraction of his debts, and whose own rigamarole of moral uncertainties get fleshed out at the climax of the film with devastating reaction shots that practically upend the movie. Gems occupies a larger, more terrifying world than the Safdies’ previous films, and it also wears us down with much less inhibition, if you can imagine that. When the late premiere screening of the film ended, I stumbled out into the dark riding a sugar high that verged on a headache. I was troubled, mortified, and unforgivably hyped, overwhelmed by its choices; I passed a guy who complained that the film “went nowhere” (“but Sandler was good at least”)—which is right on both fronts. Howard is a psychological dilemma manifest: a mind intent on destroying itself, a one-man karmic wheel. Uncut Gems sets the wheel spinning. By the end, you'll wish that it hadn’t.",POSITIVE

Adam Sandler has embodied many obnoxious, self-absorbed figures over the years, but with “Uncut Gems,” he plays the most contemptible character in a 30-year career. Directors Joshua and Benny Safdie’s followup to “Good Time” is on that same wavelength — abrasive, deranged, driven by an insuppressible blur of movement and noise. It’s also a riveting high-wire act, pairing cosmic visuals with the gritty energy of a dark psychological thriller and sudden bursts of frantic comedy, and it’s the first movie to truly commune with Sandler’s performative strengths since “Punch-Drunk Love.” If “Uncut Gems” leaves people rattled, disoriented, grasping for clarity in the chaos of one man’s hectic routine, that all speaks to the sheer precision of a visionary achievement in full control. After all, it’s a Safdie brothers movie. Ever since 2008’s “The Pleasure of Being Robbed,” these sibling filmmakers have excelled at burrowing inside the mindset of combustible characters driven to destructive tendencies just to survive another day. The dysfunctional father of “Daddy Longlegs” may as well exist in the same restless universe as the furious junkies in “Heaven Knows What” and Robert Pattinson’s hapless criminal and loving brother in “Good Time.” With “Uncut Gems,” the Safdies add one more impetuous creation to their jittery New York City milieu, and it’s a hypnotic blast to watch him come to life. Sandler’s Howard Ratner, a fast-talking jeweler always chasing the next big score, speeds through nearly every scene of “Uncut Gems” as if dodging bullets and mounting attacks at once. Ratner’s claustrophobic office in Manhattan’s diamond district matches his ramshackle presence: The bullet-proof glass doors have a buzzer that barely works, and often leave clients hopelessly trapped on the wrong side. Howard juggles calls from angry mobsters and bookies, shrugs off domestic squabbles with his infuriated wife (a smarmy Idina Menzel), and sneaks to his apartment for late-night trysts with girlfriend (Julia Fox), who also happens to work for him. Howard thrives in the mayhem, as the opening minutes make clear, with cinematographer Darius Khondji’s camera swirling around the figure as he goes about his wild days; a remarkable percussive soundtrack by Daniel Lopatin (aka Oneohtrix Point Never) overwhelms the constant whir of action. If that’s all the movie had to offer, the endurance test would have its limits. By then, however, it’s clear that the Safdies (and their writing partner, Ronald Bronstein) have more ambitious plans: An awe-inspiring prologue, set in shadowy depths of an Ethiopian mine, chronicles the discovery of a costly rock filled with shimmering opals. The ominous sequence suggests a hat-tip to Indiana Jones, at least until the movie turns psychedelic. The camera careens closer and closer to the rainbow-colored diamonds and then keeps going, veering inside their fibers as if channeling the star gate in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” But as the shot resolves itself within Howard’s colonoscopy, the magic becomes entwined Howard’s rough-hewn world, epitomizing his desire to possess otherworldly power even as his actual world constantly unravels. Yet Howard keeps moving because he sees potential just around the corner. As the movie settles into its rhythms, he’s on the verge of landing what he sees as his next big score. The year is 2012, if for no other reason than to allow former Celtics forward Kevin Garnett to play himself as an active player (Garnett retired in 2016). Brought into the jeweler’s shop by a freewheeling broker (Lakeith Stanfield), Garnett finds himself drawn to the beauty of the opal rock that Howard brandishes just to show off. Howard doesn’t want to sell the object, but allows Garnett to take it home for the night for good luck on his next game. For insurance, Howard secures Garnett’s championship ring, then abruptly pawns it off to bet big on the next game. That insane pileup of choices becomes a house of cards that collapses in delirious slow motion over the next two-plus hours. Stanfield’s character deems Howard a “fucking crazy-ass Jew,” a description that could readily apply to the Sandler oeuvre as a whole — but in Howard’s case, it’s practically a compliment. A goateed hustler with glittery diamond earrings who never seems capable of calming down, Howard’s neuroses compel him to work through every new challenge in his quest to realize a twisted American dream. That quest suggests “Mean Streets” by way of Preston Sturges, with a touch of “Death of a Salesman” to boot — a mesmerizing chronicle of desperate schemes, and it’s hard to imagine anyone but Sandler at the center of it. While “Good Time” unfolded as a linear chronicle of one troubled night, “Uncut Gems” speeds through Howard’s life as a cascade of clashing moments. The Safdies’ ability to string these sequences together without taking a single breather is absolute narrative marvel: Howard goes from an impromptu Philly roadtrip to watching his kid in a bizarre school play, dodging gangsters in the parking lot, pushing back against a looming divorce during the family’s Passover seder, arguing with a bookie (Eric Bogosian) and talking a baffled family friend (Judd Hirsch) into helping him rig an ill-fated auction. Phew. These circumstances pile up with an astonishing kinetic energy. The Safdies clearly idolize Robert Altman (and have openly cited his gambling romp “California Split” as inspiration here), but they’re more precisely operating within the grimy New York milieu that Martin Scorsese made famous in the ‘70s (Scorsese serves as an executive producer). At the same time, they’ve constructed a confident extension of the anti-heroes found throughout their work, and the movie owes more to their own expanding oeuvre than the obvious precedents for it. Even “Lenny Cooke,” the Safdies’ tragicomic documentary about a wayward basketball star, comes into play as the movie builds toward an NBA playoffs game with impossibly high stakes. “Uncut Gems” won’t sit well with anyone who prefers protagonists easy to like or stories with a clean moral compass. But there’s a genuine subversive glee involved in following Howard through his inane quest for all the money he can score, and watching him set himself up for failure with such conviction the whole way through. Howard may be doomed from the start, but in the process of resisting his inevitable fate, “Uncut Gems” makes his ludicrous plan infectious.

"Sep 1, 2019"," 
	Guiding Adam Sandler through his most unhinged performance yet, the Safdie brothers create a delirious, high-intensity character study of a desperate New York jeweler with too many schemes going at the same time. Audiences have been comparing Josh and Benny Safdie’s “Uncut Gems” to a cocaine rush since it premiered at the Telluride Film Festival. I wouldn’t know, but it’s a trip all right: Like a cross between a seat-of-your-pants heist movie and a protracted heart attack, this virtuoso character portrait grabs viewers by the lapels and thrusts them into the mind of Howard Ratner (Adam Sandler), which is not a place most moviegoers would care to spend much time. That’s because most moviegoers are looking for simple escapism, whereas “Uncut Gems” feels like being locked inside the pinwheeling brain of a lunatic for more than two hours — and guess what: It’s a gas! Howie runs a by-appointment-only jewelry store in New York’s diamond district, a humming network of tiny stands and private showrooms where specialists handle the bulk of the city’s precious stones. It’s a traditionally Jewish enclave, and everyone there seems to know Howie, who’s well-liked but an obvious loose cannon: A reckless adulterer, an incorrigible gambling addict and a borderline con artist, Howie owes his brother-in-law Aron (Eric Bogosian) a sum somewhere in the low six figures, but like always, he’s got a plan that will make him rich. He’s expecting delivery on a massive black opal, which he believes to be worth at least a million dollars. In an act of pure showmanship, the Safdies show the treasure being hauled out of an Ethiopian mine in an opening scene that plays like something out of “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” plunging into the sparkling core of the stone via a gag shot that spins through the cosmos for a minute or so before coming out the other end deep in Howie’s bowels. For some audiences, getting an actual colonoscopy would be more pleasant than the experience of sitting through “Uncut Gems,” which the Safdies have carefully tooled for our discomfort, layering a cacophony of sound and music on top of DP Darius Khondji’s restless handheld camerawork, all of which intensifies the insanity of the overlapping crises in Howie’s life. The trick is to embrace this unique opportunity to identify with such a high-strung character — a throwback to the maddening, trapped-inside-Sandler’s-head experience of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Punch-Drunk Love” nearly two decades ago. That was the film that demonstrated how the right director could take what had long annoyed critics about Sandler’s shrill, stunted man-child routine and leverage it on behalf of more nuanced character studies. Here, the goateed actor dons a diamond earing, false teeth and tinted specs to create an all-new character: an immature grownup with a knack for making the worst decision in any given situation. While the Safdies no doubt had Anderson’s film in mind when they cast Sandler, the milieu came first. The siblings have been wanting to make a movie about Manhattan’s diamond district for more than a decade. As Josh put it before the big Telluride screening, “It feels like every movie [we’ve made] has been an educational detour for this film,” and sure enough, “Uncut Gems” serves as a summation of their previous work, from the nearly oppressive subjectivity of “Daddy Long Legs” to the anxiety-inducing petty-crime spiral of “Good Time.” With “Uncut Gems,” the directors have definitely hit the big time, making a divisive but undeniably rowdy character study that rivals such heavyweights as “Taxi Driver” and “Pi” in its single-minded commitment to a certifiable head case. Maybe to Howie, it looks like he’s got everything under control, but even his love life is a mess: While multi-tasking a high-maintenance fling with one of his clerks (sly newcomer Julia Fox) on the side, he’s trying to keep his wife (Idina Menzel, all pursed lips and exhausted patience) and kids happy at home, stepping out of his daughter’s school play to escape the debt collectors hovering in the back row (those perfectly cast goons round out the believably ripped-from-real-life ensemble). Among Howie’s many stress-management strategies — tricks that work for him better than they do for us, who aren’t accustomed to functioning in red-alert mode all the time — is a tendency to run his mouth, and the Safdies are shrewd not to make him sound any more eloquent than the desperately cornered shmuck that he is. Their darkly comedic script (co-written with “Daddy Long Legs” star Ronald Bronstein) spans roughly a week’s time, prioritizing the moments when Howie must think fast, as when he catches his girlfriend flirting with hip-hop star the Weeknd at a private party, or later, when he orders her to place a massive sports bet while Aron and his thugs sit trapped in the security chamber outside his shop. His big hope remains the rare Ethiopian opal, which shows up stuffed into the guts of a frozen fish while Boston Celtics star Kevin Garnett is browsing the shop for bling. One of the many high-end clients whom celebrity hook-up Demany (Lakeith Stanfield) brings around, the basketballer represents a new class of American wealth that Howie and his community are all too happy to serve — although the opal, which catches Garnett’s attention immediately, is earmarked for auction the following Monday. Garnett asks to borrow the rock, treating it like a good-luck talisman for the night’s big game, and against any sane person’s better judgment, Howie agrees, scrambling to pawn a few valuable items (none of which are his) so he can place a bet on the outcome. That Celtics game — which finds Howie shouting at the TV as it unfolds across a series of squirm-inducing domestic scenes — is but one of the sequences in which audiences will find it hard to breathe, feeling their temples throb amid composer Daniel Lopatin’s dialogue-drowning music. Without question, watching “Uncut Gems” is a singular experience, but a tough one to recommend, since most people would prefer not to have their eyes punched and ears hammered nonstop for two hours in what amounts to a relentless sensory assault. Does Howie ever relax? When does he sleep? More experienced filmmakers know how to modulate the tone over the course of the film, orchestrating both highs and lows, with quiet, reflective moments built in for people to catch their breath. By contrast, the Safdies are committed to sustaining the intensity for the entire running time, which can be both exhilarating and exhausting. In their view, there is variation in Howie’s mood: There are moments when the man feels genuinely happy, and Sandler’s supernova presence radiates extra hot to reflect them. But Howie lives less for the promise of the ultimate score than for the addictive thrill that things could go sideways in a flash. And do they ever when that time comes, making for an ending that will go down in film history — shocking and yet somehow inevitable.",POSITIVE
"Sep 1, 2019"," THR review: Adam Sandler plays a brash, compulsive New York City jeweler and gambler in 'Uncut Gems,' the latest from the Safdie brothers ('Good Time'). “I think you are the most annoying person on the planet,” someone remarks to Howard Ratner, a madly obnoxious wheeler-dealer in New York’s diamond district. The question immediately becomes whether this frantic, sweaty, manic, disorganized, unreliable and frequently desperate middle-aged man will emerge as a figure of revulsion or fascination to the audience. It’s thus a tribute to writer-directors Josh and Benny Safdie and Adam Sandler, who plays the part, that Uncut Gems emerges as a real gem itself, a sparkling comedy-drama about a compulsive gambler and risk-taker who never knows when to quit. Many will agree that this is Sandler’s best performance, and the Safdies will finally move from the fringes of the commercial film scene to somewhere closer to the center. This is not because the Safdies have made a lovable movie — far from it. From the beginning, in a prolonged and intense scene in Howard’s 47th Street-area jewelry shop, the yelling and haggling and confrontational behavior is monumental; it’s possible to feel that this is the last place on Earth you’d want to be. On the other hand, some people get off on this, and for Howard it’s the core of his existence. In a brief Ethiopian-set prologue, a football-sized piece of rock is extracted from a mine, and numerous embedded gems are clearly of significant value. Having just acquired it and against his better instincts, Howard lets one of his most valued customers, basketball titan Kevin Garnett, borrow the piece, a misjudgment that sets in motion no end of crises and misfortune. The Safdies plunge the audience into the deep end of this world, and it’s easy to be both overwhelmed and seriously put off by the vulgarity of it; everyone is brash, it’s the norm for promises and expectations not to be met, feverish yelling is the accepted mode of communication and no day is complete without a new unwelcome incident. Of course, Howard doesn’t get his valued piece of rock back when he expects it, and this is just the beginning of promises not met, debts remaining unpaid, lies mounting to cover the shortcomings and everyone becoming angrier and angrier. For his part, however, Howard nearly always has an angle, another card to play — what’s a new day without a fresh fire to put out? The writers have concocted any number of outrageous incidents that, in fact, feel real and not gags invented just to be toppers. What should be a calm night out for the Ratner family on the occasion of a school theater presentation morphs into an insane set of events that finds Howard locked nude in the trunk of a car. His wife Dinah (Idina Menzel), who well knows how to deal with her husband, is naturally furious. Of course, Howard has a woman on the side, Julia (Julia Fox), a nice young lady who — what else? — works at his jewelry store and for whom he provides an apartment. This relationship hits the rocks during this period when Howard is sweating over basketball scores he’s bet big on and whether or not he’ll ever get the big gem back. Uncut Gems would need to be on any final list of films in which the greatest percentage of dialogue is yelled. And yet the Safdies and the cast go deep enough here to make the film a genuinely human one; it may not be a lifestyle that most people will recognize, but the dynamics and desires and anxieties all feel real, thanks to the way the writer-directors push through the obvious dramatic trappings to tap into credible feelings. This is also true of the entire cast top to bottom, but the way is led by Sandler. Howard’s passions for business, money, gambling, women and sports are entirely normal, but he doesn’t seem to have learned much about his own shortcomings over the years. Sandler’s performance shows that time may have provided him peeks at the errors of his ways, but the fact that he’s continued to get away with things gives him the confidence to carry on, without lessons learned. It’s a helluva part, and Sandler aces it. As his woman on the side, Fox at first seems destined to remain the mere victim of her boss/lover’s abuse and inattention, but the performance slowly opens like a flower in a beautiful way that one doesn’t expect. There’s not an actor in the cast who doesn’t deliver work that’s boisterous and full-bodied, and that includes baller Garnett, who, in addition to his numerous scenes, is glimpsed in games on TV. New York area locations provide great and varied backgrounds and Darius Khondji’s cinematography vividly evokes them in a sharp, naturalistic way. Daniel Lopatin’s big and bold score at times goes a bit over the top to become too noticeable compared to what it accompanies onscreen, but it also properly serves the grandiose schemes and emotions of the characters.",POSITIVE
"Aug 31, 2019"," There ought to be some analogous maxim for the if “it bends, it’s funny, if it breaks, it’s not funny,” aphorism once famously spoke by Alan Alda in a classic New York movie, but applied to movies with unrelenting, unbearable, nerve-rattling tension. Because by all rights, filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie’s latest New York sweaty, heart-attack inducer, “Uncut Gems,” a gritty, tragicomedy thriller, ought to snap in half. For over two hours, this frantic, frenetic cacophony of sound, music, and overlapping, sometimes hard-to-discern dialogue keeps rising and crescendoing to nearly absurdly comical levels. Editing law of physics would normally dictate that a restless, roving, high-wire act movie like this—which feels like a wild injection of pure cocaine— would eventually shatter and collapse under the weight of its own pressure. But this masterful symphony of tension building, somehow never does. Held together by a hilarious, manic, tour-de-force performance by Adam Sandler—one of his very best which now ranks among “Punch Drunk Love” and those all-time touchstones (update your rankings asap)—the Safdies somehow outdo their last, similarly chaotic picture “Good Time,” and create a new “Mean Streets” for their own generation. No one does a New York grift and street hustle like the Safdies and while the material, tone, and tenor are fairly similar to their last film—another electric and grueling portrait of desperation under stressful circumstances with the clock ticking— “Uncut Gems” still manages to be bigger and more ambitious in scope. Appropriately executive-produced by Martin Scorsese— a spiritual handoff to his raw, early days of filmmaking— “Uncut Gems” is an insane ride with no respite that will grind your senses down to their last nerve. Set in the diamond district of New York City, Howard Ratner (Sandler), a self-destructive, compulsive risktaker, is way underwater. A charismatic jewelry store owner and dealer, Howard is in crisis, and his life is falling apart. His debts are out of control and several loan sharks are swimming around sensing the blood in the water. His marriage to the long-suffering Dinah (Idina Menzel, terrific) is basically over, but they’re keeping up appearances for the children, for now. Howard’s life is one scam after another, and a continuous act of precarious juggling that he maybe actually gets off on, thrives on. Homelife is somehow balanced with a girlfriend Julia (a fetching Julia Fox), who also works as one of his jewelry clerks. His tiny, cramped, unruly jewelry store is constantly bumrushed with characters, many of them African-American rappers or sports figures thanks to Demany (Lakeith Stanfield), a hustler paid to sway clientele to come to Howard’s place. One of those clients that helps get the already-racing plot further in motion is NBA player Kevin Garnett (playing himself). He quickly becomes enamored with a black opal diamond that Howard gets his hands on through the Ethiopia black market and shady methods. Worth millions in Howard’s estimation, this near-magical, diamond—depicted as having magically hypnotic qualities in unlikely cosmic sequences that feel like they’re lifted out of a celestial Terrence Malick-made sequence — is the supposed solution to all of the jeweler’s problems, but there’s one complication. The all-star baller is so infatuated with the gem, he wants to keep it with him for inspiration in upcoming games which complicates everything while goons are breathing down Howard’s neck. Howard owes everyone money and everyone is looking to collect and bust some skulls in the process, if necessary. The heat is around the corner at every turn, and thanks to claustrophobic and predatory telephoto cinematography by Darius Khonji, the camera feels like its stalking the man’s footsteps. Howard’s unwieldy bets upon bets, micro-loans, sidepiece hustles, and tricky grifts with plenty of vigs on top, would make a normal man feel like they’re drowning ten times over. But Howard is seemingly an addict to this level of action, the juice, all of it all —he seems to have a Ph.D. in high-level risk management at the street level, getting off on the peril and amphetamine-y rush. Howard treats debts like the thrill of auto-erotic asphyxiation and “Uncut Gems” is nearly pornographic in its edging tautness. Even one of Howard’s family members Arno (a menacing Eric Bogosian) has sicced rabid thugs (Keith Williams Richards) on Howard to get back what they’re owed. Filled with a terrific cast, Judd Hirsch, musician The Weeknd—playing himself at a private party, black-lit to Safdies perfection—talk show host Mike Francesca, and more “Uncut Gems” absolutely crackles with the authentic energy of New York, and the underhanded characters, mugs, and goons that inhabit it. Electric from minute one, on top of the freewheeling, freefalling staging, and Robert Altman-esque discordance of five conversations happening at once, the Safdie’s movie greatly benefits once again from a searing, perspiring pulsating score by Oneohtrix Point Never’s score (aka Daniel Lopatin). It should be said, as exhausting as it can be, the neo-noir thriller can be really ridiculously funny in its dark humor (Philip Roth would likely be proud of the tragic Jewish-American hilarity of some of these scenarios). Whether inside the mines of Ethiopia, inside Howard’s rectum during a colonoscopy, or inside the mystic gems of a black opal diamond, “Uncut Gems” is never afraid to push the viewer down deeper, darker into the abyss its character is falling into—or chasing after for the greatest orgasm ever, it’s hard to tell which. Dizzying, but engrossing and entertaining, “Uncut Gems” is not for the faint of heart. The Safdie’s arguably don’t know how to make a movie that isn’t dialed up to 11 and isn’t lodged in your throat, but how glorious and unsettling that wildness can be.",NEGATIVE
